        "text": "The Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball program is the intercollegiate men's basketball program of the University of Kansas. The program is classified in the NCAA's Division I and the team competes in the Big 12 Conference. Kansas is considered one of the most prestigious college basketball programs in the country with six overall national championships (4 NCAA Tournament National Championships and 2 Helms National Championships), as well being runner-up six times and having the most conference titles in the nation. The Jayhawks also own the NCAA record for most consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances with 28 consecutive appearances. Since the 1984 tournament, the Jayhawks have only missed the tournament twice and both times were due to disciplinary action from the NCAA; they were ruled ineligible for the 1989 tournament and had their 2018 appearance was vacated. They have not missed the tournament strictly due to on the court performance since the 1983 tournament. They were also, along with Dartmouth, the first team to appear in multiple NCAA Tournaments after making their second appearance in the 1942 tournament. The Jayhawks had been ranked in the AP poll for 231 consecutive polls, a streak that had stretched from the poll released on February 2, 2009, poll through the poll released on February 8, 2021, which is the longest streak in AP poll history. Of the 24 seasons the Big 12 conference has been in existence, Kansas has won at least a share of 19 regular-season conference titles.\nThe Jayhawks' first coach was the inventor of basketball, James Naismith. Naismith, ironically, is the only coach in Kansas basketball history with a losing record. The Kansas basketball program has produced many notable professional players, including Clyde Lovellette, Wilt Chamberlain, Jo Jo White, Danny Manning, Raef LaFrentz, Paul Pierce, Nick Collison, Kirk Hinrich, Mario Chalmers, Andrew Wiggins, and Joel Embiid. Politician Bob Dole also played basketball at Kansas. Former players that have gone on to be coaches include Phog Allen, Adolph Rupp, Dean Smith, Dutch Lonborg, and former assistants to go on to be notable coaches include John Calipari, Gregg Popovich, and Bill Self. Mark Turgeon, Jerod Haase, Danny Manning, and Tad Boyle are all former players and assistant coaches that became head coaches. Allen founded the National Association of Basketball Coaches and, with Lonborg, was an early proponent of the NCAA tournament. Four different Jayhawk head coaches are in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as coaches, Phog Allen, Larry Brown, Roy Williams, and current head coach Bill Self. Three different Division I basketball arenas have been named after former Kansas players, the Dean Smith Center named after Dean Smith at North Carolina, Rupp Arena named after Adolph Rupp at Kentucky, and the Jayhawks’ own arena Allen Fieldhouse named after Phog Allen.\nIn 2008, ESPN ranked Kansas second on a list of the most prestigious programs of the modern college basketball era. Kansas currently has the longest streak of consecutive NCAA tournament appearances of all-time (28), the longest current streak of consecutive NCAA winning seasons (39), the most winning seasons in Division I history (104), the most non-losing seasons (.500 or better) in NCAA history (106), the most conference championships in Division I history (63), tied with UCLA for the most consecutive regular-season conference titles in Division I (13), the most First-Team All-Americans in Division I history (24), and the most First-Team All-American selections in Division I history (31). As of the last complete season, the program ranks third in Division I all-time winning percentage (.723) and second in Division I all-time wins (2,370).\nSince the opening of Allen Fieldhouse, the Jayhawks’ home arena, in 1955, the Jayhawks have earned a well established home court advantage. Allen Fieldhouse is often considered one of the best home court advantages in college basketball. As of 2024, the Jayhawks have won over 87 percent of their games in the 69-year history of Allen Fieldhouse, losing just 112 games. Under current head coach Bill Self, the Jayhawks have had three home court winning streaks over 30 games and two over 50 games. In addition to Allen Fieldhouse, the Jayhawks frequently play games at the nearby T-Mobile Center (formerly Sprint Center) in Kansas City, Missouri. These games, while technically a neutral site, are officially considered home games when not part of a tournament, the only exception being their games at the arena during their six-game series with rival Missouri.\nHistory.\nKansas ranks second all-time in NCAA Division I wins with 2,357 wins (as of the last complete season), against 877 losses (.729 all time winning %, third all-time). This record includes a 765–110 (.874) mark at historic Allen Fieldhouse. The Jayhawks are first in NCAA history with 98 winning seasons, and tied for first in NCAA history with 101 non-losing (.500 or better) seasons with Kentucky. Kansas is tied for the fewest head coaches (8) of any program that has played since the 19th century, yet has reached the Final Four under more head coaches (6) than any other program in the nation. Every head coach at Kansas since the inception of the NCAA Tournament has led the program to the Final Four. Kansas has had four head coaches inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame, more than any other program in the nation. A perennial conference powerhouse, Kansas leads Division I all-time in regular season conference titles with 62 in 113 years of conference play (the MVIAA Conference was created in 1907) through the 2019–20 regular season. The Jayhawks have won a record 20 conference titles and a record 11 conference tournament titles in the 24 years of the Big 12's existence. The program also owns the best Big 12 records in both those areas with a 412–102 record in conference play and a 46–12 record in tournament play. The Jayhawks won their 2,000th game in school history when they defeated Texas Tech in the 2009–2010 season, joining the University of Kentucky and the University of North Carolina as the only schools to boast such an achievement at that time.\nJames Naismith era (1898–1907).\nThe men's basketball program officially began in 1898, following the arrival of Dr. James Naismith to the school, just six years after Naismith had written the sport's first official rules. Naismith was initially hired to be a chapel director and physical education instructor, but became the head basketball coach.\nThe Jayhawks played their first game on February 3, 1899, against the Kansas City YMCA, a game they lost 5–16. They would win their first game a week later on February 10 in a 31–6 victory over the Topeka YMCA. Their first intercollegiate game was played on March 23 against Haskell, a school about two miles southeast of the southeastern edge of the University of Kansas. They would finish their first season 7–4.\nDuring the programs early years, the majority of the university's basketball games were played against nearby YMCA teams, with YMCAs across the nation having played an integral part in the birth of basketball. Other common opponents were Haskell and William Jewell. Under Naismith, the team began their rivalries with Kansas State, later deemed the Sunflower Showdown and Missouri, later deemed the Border War (officially changed to Border Showdown in 2004). Naismith was, ironically, the only coach in the program's history to have a losing record (55–60).\nIncluding his years as coach, Naismith served as the athletic director and a faculty member at Kansas for a total of almost 40 years before retiring in 1937. Naismith died in 1939, and his remains are buried in Lawrence, Kansas. The basketball court in Allen Fieldhouse is named James Naismith Court. Beyond inventing the game, his next greatest basketball legacy may be his coaching tree, whose two trunks are the well-known Phog Allen and Kansas native John McLendon. (McLendon attended KU in the 1930s when Allen was head coach. Although McLendon tried out for the team, he never played for Allen. Naismith mentored McLendon from his arrival at Kansas through degree completion and beyond.)\nOn December 10, 2010, the David Booth family purchased Dr. James Naismith's 13 Original Rules of the game at a Sotheby's auction in New York City for the sum of $4.3 million. They brought the founding document of basketball back to KU's Lawrence campus, where it is currently housed at the DeBruce Center.\nPhog Allen/William O. Hamilton era (1907–1956).\nIn 1907, Kansas hired one of Naismith's players, Dr. Forrest C. \"Phog\" Allen as head coach. Naismith provided Allen with a now infamous piece of wisdom: \"You can't coach basketball; you just play it.\" Allen would set out to prove the adage wrong and through success and an unrivaled coaching tree has become known as the \"Father of Basketball Coaching\", having passed on his knowledge of the game to some of the most well-respected names in the history of college basketball, including National Basketball Hall of Fame coaches Adolph Rupp, Dean Smith, Dutch Lonborg and Ralph Miller (all except Lonborg were born and raised in Kansas). Allen coached the team from 1907 to 1909, but William O. Hamilton coached from 1909 to 1919, with Allen taking over again in 1919. The team went 125–59 and won five conference championships under Hamilton's direction.\nAllen coached KU for 39 seasons and amassed a record of 590–219, with two retroactively-awarded Helms Foundation national titles and one NCAA Tournament championship in 1952. Numerous basketball greats would play at Kansas during Allen's era, including Dean Smith, Adolph Rupp, Dutch Lonborg, and Ralph Miller (all future Hall of Fame coaches), Paul Endacott, Bill Johnson, and Clyde Lovellette (Hall of Fame players), two-time Olympic Gold Medalist Bill Hougland, and even former United States Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole.\nIn 1952, the Jayhawks won the national title with an 80–63 victory in the final game over St. John's, coached by Frank McGuire. Clyde Lovellette of Kansas was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, and is still the only player to lead the nation in scoring and lead his team to a national title in the same year. This tournament was the first to have a true \"Final Four\" format. Seven members of the championship team represented the United States in the 1952 Summer Olympics and brought home a gold medal for the national basketball team. This was especially poignant for Allen, as he had been the driving force for having basketball added to the Olympics in 1936.\nAllen was forced to retire when he turned 70 in 1956, because of a university policy requiring school employees to retire at 70. Allen had recruited legendary Wilt Chamberlain to Kansas, but would not get to coach him because freshmen were not eligible to play varsity basketball in 1956.\nDick Harp era (1956–1964).\nFollowing Allen's retirement, the Jayhawks hired former KU player and assistant, Dick Harp. Under Harp the Jayhawks went 121–82 with two conference titles and two NCAA tournament berths.\nWilt Chamberlain played his varsity years under Harp, making his job a rather easy one for the first two seasons. In his first varsity game, Chamberlain scored 52 points and grabbed 31 rebounds, breaking both all-time college records in an 87–69 win against Northwestern. In 1957, he led the Jayhawks to the championship game against North Carolina, coached by Frank McGuire, whom they had defeated in the 1952 title game when McGuire was at St. John's. McGuire triple-teamed Chamberlain and, as a result, KU was defeated 54–53 in triple overtime. The game is considered one of the greatest in NCAA history. Chamberlain continued to average 30+ points per game until leaving KU early to play professionally with the Harlem Globetrotters.\nTed Owens era (1964–1983).\nTed Owens took over for Harp in 1964, and would go 348–128 during his tenure, eventually winning six Big Eight Conference titles.\nThe team advanced to NCAA postseason play seven times under Owens. The 1971 team went 27–3 and advanced to the Final Four before losing to UCLA. In 1974 the team went 23–7 and again advanced to the Final Four before losing to Marquette.\nDuring this era the program produced All-Americans such as Jo Jo White, Walt Wesley, Bud Stallworth, Darnell Valentine, and Dave Robisch.\nAfter 19 years of coaching at University of Kansas, Owens was fired following the 1982–83 season after the Jayhawks posted back-to-back losing seasons.\nLarry Brown era (1983–1988).\nIn 1983, Larry Brown headed to the University of Kansas, after coaching in the NBA. Under Brown, Kansas finished first in the Big Eight in 1986, and second in 1984, 1985, and 1987. In 1988, Kansas got off to a 12–8 start, including 1–4 in the Big 8. The Jayhawks' 55-game homecourt winning streak in Allen Fieldhouse was snapped with a loss to rival Kansas State, and they would also lose two more home games to Duke and Oklahoma. Behind the high-scoring of Danny Manning, KU finished 21–11 at the end of the season and entered the NCAA tournament as a #6 seed. Two early upsets allowed them to face lower seeds, gain momentum, and advance. The Jayhawks would ultimately go on to face the three teams who had given them their three home losses that season. They defeated rival Kansas State in the Elite 8, then defeated Duke in the Final 4, and won the national championship, defeating favored conference rival Oklahoma 83–79 in the final. The 11 losses Kansas accrued in 1988 are more than any other national champion have before or since. The win garnered the team the nickname \"Danny and the Miracles\". Earlier, near the start of the tournament, Dick Vitale had been asked about Kansas's chances and commented \"If Kansas wins, I'll kiss the Jayhawk on the floor of Allen Fieldhouse.\" Eventually, he did make good on his promise.\nDuring Brown's tenure, Kansas had five NCAA Tournament appearances, which included two second round appearances, one Sweet 16 appearance, two trips to the Final Four and the national championship. He also compiled a 135–44 (.754) overall record. Brown left under a cloud, as NCAA sanctions and a postseason probation were levied against Kansas following Brown's departure in the 1988–1989 season as a result of recruiting violations that took place during Brown's tenure. The major violation was a plane ticket home for potential transfer Vincent Askew to see his sick grandmother. Prior to the investigation, Askew had already decided not to transfer to Kansas.\nRoy Williams era (1988–2003).\nShortly following Brown's departure, Kansas hired then North Carolina assistant Roy Williams as head coach.\nFrom 1988 to 2003, under the direction of Williams, the Jayhawks had a record of 418–101, a .805 winning percentage. Williams' Kansas teams averaged 27.8 wins per season. Except for his first season at Kansas (when the team was on probation), all of Williams' teams made the NCAA tournament. On Roy's first KU team Patrick Richey, Adonis Jordan and Richard Scott could not visit campus because of recruiting violations by Larry Brown, so they committed sight unseen. From 1990 to 1999 Kansas compiled a 286–60 record, giving them both the most wins and best winning percentage of any team in that decade. From 1994 to 1998, the Jayhawks won 62 consecutive home games at Allen Fieldhouse, which was the longest such streak in the NCAA at the time. The seniors of 1998 (Raef LaFrentz, Billy Thomas, and C.B. McGrath) went 58–0 at home during their KU careers.\nKansas won nine regular-season conference championships over Williams' last 13 years. In seven years of Big 12 Conference play, his teams went 94–18, capturing the regular-season title in 1997, 1998, 2002 and 2003 and the postseason tournament crown in 1997, 1998 and 1999. In 2001–02, KU became the first, and so far only, team to go undefeated (16–0) in Big 12 play. From 1995 to 1998, Kansas was a combined 123–17 – an average of 30.8 wins per season.\nWilliams' teams went 201–17 (.922) in Allen Fieldhouse, and won 62 consecutive games in Allen from February 1994 to December 1998. Kansas was a regular in the Associated Press Top 25 from 1991 to 1999, placing in the poll for 145 consecutive weeks. Williams' teams were ranked in the Top 10 in 194 AP polls from 1990.\nKansas led the nation in field goal percentage and scoring in 2002 and in scoring margin in 2003, held opponents to the lowest field goal percentage in the country in 2001 (37.8 percent), and led the nation in winning percentage in 1997 and 2002. The team shot better than 50 percent from the floor for seven different seasons under Williams, and led the country in field goal percentage in 1990 (53.3) and 2002 (50.6). Williams' teams shot a combined 49.4 percent from the floor during his tenure. Williams-coached teams led the nation in assists in 2001 and 2002 and were seventh in the nation in 2003; scored 100 or more points 71 times (once every 13 games); averaged 82.7 points per game over his 15 seasons as coach; and averaged 90 or more points per game in two seasons (92.1 in 1990 and 90.9 in 2002).\nThe Jayhawks were in the AP Top 25 in 242 of 268 weekly polls, reached the No. 1 ranking in the country in six different seasons, and reached at least No. 2 in the nation in 11 of William's 15 seasons as head coach at Kansas.\nUnder Williams, the team had several deep runs in the NCAA Tournament, making it to four Final Fours and appearing in the national championship game in both 1991 and 2003, losing both, to Duke and Syracuse respectively. Amidst the tournament successes, there were plenty of woes. The 1996–97 team was said by many to be one of the greatest teams in history, featuring future NBA players such as Paul Pierce, Jacque Vaughn, Raef LaFrentz, Greg Orstertag, and Scot Pollard. The team was upset in the Sweet Sixteen by the eventual champion, Arizona Wildcats.\nThe Jayhawks advanced to the Final Four in 2002 &amp; 2003. Following the national championship loss in 2003, Williams left Kansas and returned to coach at his alma mater, North Carolina.\nBill Self era (2003–present).\nBill Self was introduced as the new head coach for the 2003–04 season and in his first season at Kansas, Self inherited Williams' players and recruits, which often caused turmoil as the style of play differed between the two coaches. Nevertheless, Self led his new Kansas team to the Elite Eight at the NCAA tournament his first year.\nKU in 2004–05 was led by seniors Wayne Simien, Keith Langford, Michael Lee, and Aaron Miles. They began the season ranked #1 and started off 20–1, but then they slumped and lost six of their final nine games, including a loss to Bucknell in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The team finished 23–7 and settled for a Big 12 co-championship with Oklahoma.\nIn 2005–06, little was expected of the freshman/sophomore-dominated Jayhawks, and they began the season 10–6, including 1–2 in the Big 12. Although they did post a 73–46 win over Kentucky, they also saw the end of their 31-game winning streak over rival Kansas State with a 59–55 loss at Allen Fieldhouse, and two nights later blew a seven-point lead in the final 45 seconds of regulation en route to an 89–86 overtime loss at Missouri. But afterward, the Jayhawks matured rapidly, winning 15 of their final 17 games and avenging the losses to both Kansas State and Missouri. KU played as the #2 seed in the Big 12 Tournament in Dallas, and avenged an earlier loss to Texas with an 80–68 victory over the Longhorns in the final to clinch the tournament championship and the highlight win of the season. KU was handed a #4 seed for the NCAA Tournament but stumbled again in the first round with a loss to the Bradley Braves.\nIn the 2006–07 season, Self led Kansas to the 2007 Big 12 regular-season championship with a 14–2 record, highlighted by beating the Kevin Durant-led Texas Longhorns in come-from-behind victories in the last game of the regular season and in the Big 12 Championship game. At the end of the regular season, Kansas stood at 27–4 and ranked #2 in the nation in both the AP and coaches' polls. Kansas received a number 1 seed in the NCAA tournament, but their tournament run ended in the Elite Eight with a loss to 2-seed UCLA.\nIn the 2007–08 season, Self's Kansas team began the season 20–0 until they suffered their first loss at rival Kansas State, their first loss at Kansas State since 1983. The 2008 Jayhawks won the Big 12 regular-season title and the Big 12 conference tourney. They received a number-one seeding in the NCAA tournament in the Midwest region. On March 30, 2008, Self led Kansas to a win in an Elite Eight game over upstart Davidson College. KU won by two, 59–57. The Jayhawks played overall number 1 tournament seed North Carolina in the semifinals, a team coached by former KU head man Roy Williams. The Jayhawks opened the game with a 40–12 run over the first 12½ minutes before finally defeating them 84–66. On April 7, 2008, the Jayhawks triumphed over a one-loss Memphis team to claim the national title. With only seconds on the clock, Sherron Collins drove the ball the length of the court and threaded a pass to Mario Chalmers, who connected on a deep three-pointer to force overtime. This shot would later come to be known as \"Mario's Miracle\" in a nod to 1988 championship nickname \"Danny and the Miracles\". Kansas then outplayed Memphis in the overtime to win the NCAA Championship game, 75–68. The Jayhawks finished the season with a 37–3 record, the winningest season in Kansas history.\nIn the 2008–09 season, despite losing seven of their top nine scorers and the entire starting line-up, the Jayhawks earned their 20th consecutive NCAA tournament bid after going 25–7 (14–2), winning the conference regular season title and extending their home winning streak to 41 straight at Allen Fieldhouse. On March 22, 2009, Kansas defeated Dayton, advancing to their 3rd consecutive Sweet 16 appearance. But the Jayhawks' season ended on March 27 when Michigan State came from behind in the final minute to defeat Kansas 67–62, ending their year at 27–8. Coach Self's record, after 6 seasons with the Jayhawks, was 169–40, an .809 percentage. After the season, Self was named National Coach of the Year by the Associated Press, CBS Sports' Chevrolet Award, USBWA (Henry Iba Award), and Sporting News.\nOn April 13, Sherron Collins and Cole Aldrich announced their intent to return for the 2009–10 season. On April 23, top high school recruit Xavier Henry made his commitment to play at Kansas in the fall, prompting ESPN to name the Jayhawks as \"the team to beat in 2009–10.\" By the time the fall of 2009 arrived, Kansas was the unanimous preseason #1 team in all major publications. The Jayhawks finished the regular season with a 29–2 record and continue to hold the Division I record for the current consecutive home winning streak at 59 straight games in Allen Fieldhouse. Kansas passed 2,000 all-time wins in the 2009–10 season, only the third school to do so (finishing the season with a total of 2,003 all-time victories). They won the Big 12 tournament on March 13, clinching their 21st consecutive NCAA tournament appearance, an active NCAA record. However, despite being named the overall #1 seed in the tournament, the Jayhawks fell in the second round to #9-seeded Northern Iowa, finishing the season at 33–3.\nRecruiting began immediately for the 2010–11 season, as Kansas landed the nation's top recruit Josh Selby in April. By September 2010, both The Sporting News and Athlon Sports had ranked Kansas in their pre-season outlook as #4 overall and, along with ESPN's Joe Lunardi, were projected to become a #1 seed again in the 2011 NCAA Tournament, which they would again earn. Blue Ribbon and the USA Today/ESPN coaches polls both placed Kansas at #7 in the pre-season poll. Josh Selby, became eligible and joined the Jayhawk line-up on December 18. On March 5, the Jayhawks beat Missouri 70–66 to clinch the Big 12 regular-season title for the 7th consecutive time and later went on to finish 29–2 during the regular season, ranked #2 in both the AP Poll and the USA Today/ESPN Coaches Poll. Bill Self was named Big 12 Coach of the Year and Marcus Morris was named Big 12 Player of the Year. The Jayhawks defeated 16 seed Boston University, 9 seed Illinois and 12 seed Richmond to reach their 3rd Elite Eight in the past 5 seasons before falling to 11 seed Virginia Commonwealth University in the quarterfinal game. During the season, Kansas moved past North Carolina as the 2nd winningest basketball program in history.\nAfter being considered the top team but falling short in both of the previous two seasons, Kansas lost six of their top 8 scorers for the 2011–12 season. The Jayhawks had to rebuild after winning seven straight Big 12 titles. Prior to the season, the NCAA declared that three of the Jayhawks top recruits were ineligible for the season, which included games against perennial powerhouse programs such as Kentucky, Duke, Ohio State, and Georgetown. Despite 7 games against top 10 ranked opponents, Kansas finished the regular season 26–5, earned their 8th consecutive Big 12 title, and advanced to their 14th Final Four in school history. The Jayhawks faced another 2 seed, the Ohio State Buckeyes, in the National Semifinals, and came back from a 13-point first-half deficit to win the game, 64–62. They then faced the Kentucky Wildcats, who had beaten the Louisville Cardinals on the other side of the bracket, in the championship game. Kansas lost to the Wildcats, 67–59.\nKansas entered the 2012–13 season with eight straight Big 12 titles in tow. They ended the season having won 107 of their last 109 games at home. After scoring their ninth consecutive title and winning the Big 12 tournament championship by defeating rival Kansas State for the third time that season, KU set its sights on a sixth national title. They were seeded #1 in the South bracket, defeating Western Kentucky and North Carolina before losing in overtime to Michigan 87–85 in the Sweet 16.\nWith star freshmen Andrew Wiggins and Joel Embiid on the roster, Kansas entered the 2013–14 season as the #5 team in the country. They started off well with five straight wins, including a victory over Duke in the Champions' Classic. However, the team went 4–4 over its next eight games, including back-to-back losses to Colorado and Florida and an ugly home loss to San Diego State. The team recovered from this rough stretch and began Big 12 play with seven straight wins, ultimately finishing 14–4 to win its 10th consecutive Big 12 title. A back injury to Joel Embiid, however, left the Jayhawks vulnerable on their interior defense, and they fizzled out at season's end with four losses in their final seven games, including a loss to Iowa State in the Big 12 Tournament quarterfinals in Kansas City and an NCAA Tournament Round of 32 loss to Stanford to end the year. Kansas concluded the year 25–10, the first ten-loss season for Kansas since Roy Williams' 1999–2000 Jayhawks went 24–10.\nAfter the exodus of Andrew Wiggins and Joel Embiid to the NBA draft, the Jayhawks reloaded with freshmen Kelly Oubre Jr. and Cliff Alexander, the Jayhawks looked poised for another Big 12 season title, which would be their 11th straight. After a loss in the Champions Classic to Kentucky, the Jayhawks finished 11–2 in the non-conference. In what many regarded as the toughest conference in the nation (Big 12) the Jayhawks won their 11th straight title outright with a record of 13–5, having lost a strong post presence in Cliff Alexander due to an investigation by the NCAA of improper benefits being given to Alexander. Evidence never clearly materialized, but Alexander was held out and played his last game as a Jayhawk at Kansas State, where they lost by 7. They then lost in the Big 12 Championship game to Iowa State 70–66, and had a final record going into the tournament of 26–8. The Jayhawks were given a 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament, where they ousted 15 seed New Mexico State by 19 points, but exited the tournament early at the hands of Wichita State by 13 points. Both Oubre Jr. and Alexander declared for the draft shortly after the conclusion of the NCAA tournament.\nThe 2015–16 Jayhawks, led by Perry Ellis and Frank Mason, won a 12th consecutive Big 12 title and won the Big 12 Tournament. Seeded #1 in the NCAA South Region, the Jayhawks reached the Elite Eight, where they stumbled against #2 seed Villanova, the eventual national champions.\nIn 2016–17, behind the leadership of national player of the year Frank Mason, the Jayhawks won a 13th consecutive Big 12 title, tying UCLA's record for most consecutive conference titles. Although the team made an early exit from the Big 12 Tournament with a quarterfinal loss to TCU, the Jayhawks got the #1 seed in the NCAA Midwest Region. They dominated UC-Davis, Michigan State, and Purdue in their first three games, but ran into a buzzsaw against Oregon in the Elite Eight.\nThe 2017–18 Jayhawks lost a number of players to graduation, the NBA Draft, and transfer; but appeared to be poised for another spectacular season. Star freshman Billy Preston was sidelined by an NCAA inquiry into the financial picture surrounding his car, and ultimately left the team to play professional basketball in Europe. Kansas won its first seven games before losing in Kansas City to Washington and at home to Arizona State. Kansas would lose a total of three home games during the season, the most for any Bill Self-coached Kansas team, and the most since losing three home games in the 1998–99 season. The season bottomed out in early February with a home loss to Oklahoma State and a 16-point loss at Baylor. But Kansas rallied to win a 14th straight Big 12 title, breaking UCLA's record. Then they defeated West Virginia to win the Big 12 Tournament. Seeded #1 in the NCAA Midwest Region, the Jayhawks defeated Penn, Seton Hall, Clemson, and Duke to reach Bill Self's third Final Four appearance and the program's 15th overall. However, they stumbled against Villanova for the second time in three years. As with their last outing, Villanova wound up as the college champions. On October 11, 2023, the NCAA would rule that Kansas would vacate the 15 wins in which Silvio De Souza played during that season, Big 12 Tournament title, NCAA appearance and their Final Four appearance due NCAA violations.\nKansas played in the 2015 World University Games in South Korea as the United States representatives in July 2015. The Jayhawks went undefeated in the World University Games, winning the championship to give the United States its first gold medal in World University Games men's basketball since 2005. In August 2017, Self and the Jayhawks traveled to Italy to play four exhibition matches against local professional Italian teams.\nShortly before the 2019–20 season began the NCAA announced they had major NCAA violations stemming from their involvement in the 2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball corruption scandal putting their NCAA record consecutive tournament appearance streak in jeopardy.\nThe Jayhawks finished the 2019–20 regular season 28–3 and were unanimously ranked number one in the final regular season AP poll. The Jayhawks went undefeated against unranked teams, and their three losses came to ranked teams. The Jayhawks were a favorite to win the NCAA Tournament, but the tournament was cancelled on March 12, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe following season, the Jayhawks struggled early in the conference schedule. After eight games, they had a 4–4 conference record. At one point during conference play, they lost five of seven games which included a 3-game losing streak, a rarity under Self. They would finish the regular season the season winning seven of their last eight games, including a 71–58 defeat of number 2 ranked Baylor, who was undefeated going into the game. Kansas withdrew from the Big 12 tournament after a player tested positive for COVID-19. They qualified for the tournament, extending their NCAA record to 31 consecutive tournaments. They defeated Eastern Washington in the first round. The following round, they were beaten by USC 51–85, their worst NCAA Tournament loss in school history and one of the worst defeats in program history.\nOn April 2, 2021, Kansas signed Self to a lifetime contract. The contract will automatically add an extra year to every year he coaches until he retires or dies.\nThe 2021–22 team earned a number 1 seed in the 2022 NCAA tournament. They defeated Providence in the tournament to become the winningest program in the nation. They defeated Villanova in the Final Four. The Jayhawks defeated North Carolina 72–69 in the national championship game to win Self's second championship, and the team's fourth NCAA championship. In the championship game, they completed a 16-point comeback, including being down 40–25 at halftime, the largest in NCAA championship history.\nConference affiliations.\nKansas has been affiliated with the following conferences:\nCoaches.\nDespite having a program for over 120 years, the Jayhawks have only had 8 head coaches. Four of their coaches have been inducted to the Hall of Fame as a coach. The longest tenured coach was Phog Allen at 39 seasons, while the shortest tenured coach was Larry Brown, who coached for 5 seasons. Allen also has the most wins in Kansas basketball history with 590. The next closest coach is current head coach Bill Self, who has won over 500 games. Ted Owens is the only coach in program history to have been fired. Allen and Harp are the only Jayhawk coaches to have also played at the school. Self had his first coaching job as an assistant under Brown at Kansas.\nOf programs who have been around for at least 100 years, Kansas has had the fewest coaches, yet they have been led to the Final Four by more coaches than any other program. Every coach that has coached Kansas since the inception of the NCAA Tournament in 1939 has led the team to a Final Four. Phog Allen, Dick Harp, Ted Owens, Larry Brown, Roy Williams, and Bill Self have all led Kansas to NCAA Final Four appearances. Of those coaches, Allen, Brown, and Bill Self have led the Jayhawks to NCAA Championships (in 1952, 1988, 2008, and 2022 respectively). In addition to an NCAA Tournament National Championship, Allen won two retroactively awarded Helms Athletic Foundation National Championships for the 1922 and 1923 seasons. Allen and Self are the only coaches to win multiple National Championships of any kind, while Self is the only one to win multiple NCAA Tournament National Championships.\nWhile officially only having had eight coaches in program history, the Jayhawks also had three interim coaches who are not considered an official part of the coaching history. In 1919, Karl Schlademan coached, and won, the first game of the season before relinquishing the coaching position to Allen in order to concentrate on his duties as head track coach. In 1947, Howard Engleman coached 14 games (going 8–6) after Allen was ordered to take a rest following the 13th game of the season. Engleman's record is not listed in this table as he was never officially a head coach at the university. Assistant coach Norm Roberts served as acting head coach for the beginning of the 2022–23 season while Bill Self served a 4-game suspension for alleged recruiting violations. He served as the acting head coach again for Kansas in the Big 12 and NCAA Tournaments while Bill Self was away from the team following a heart procedure. Each of these coaches have every one of their wins counted in their career records in the NCAA record books. The only exception is Roberts, who only has 4 wins early in the season counted, instead the 4 wins and 2 losses in the postseason; those 4 wins and 2 losses are counted in Self's career coaching record.\n\"Updated March 20, 2023\"\nFacilities.\nSince first fielding a program, the Jayhawks have had three official home arenas. Kansas also occasionally will play regular season games at the T-Mobile Center in Kansas City.\nEarly venues (1898–1907).\nBefore 1907 the Jayhawks played in various venues, ranging from the basement of the original Snow Hall (even though the ceiling was only 14 feet high) to the skating rink at the local YMCA. Although a current campus building bears the same name, the original Snow Hall was demolished in 1934.\nRobinson Gymnasium (1907–1927).\nRobinson Gym was the first athletic building on the KU campus and featured a 2,500-seat auditorium used for basketball purposes. The building was demolished in 1967.\nHoch Auditorium (1927–1955).\nHoch Auditorium was a 3,500 seat multi-purpose arena in Lawrence, Kansas. It opened in 1927. It was home to the University of Kansas Jayhawks basketball teams until Allen Fieldhouse opened in 1955.\nMany of Hoch's nicknames during the basketball years were \"Horrible Hoch\" and \"The House of Horrors.\" Such nicknames were in reference to the difficulty opposing teams had in dealing with the tight area surrounding the court and the curved walls and decorative lattice work directly behind the backboards. The curvature of the walls made the backboards appear to be moving causing opponents to miss free throws.\nOn June 15, 1991, Hoch Auditorium was struck by lightning. The auditorium and stage area were completely destroyed. Only the limestone facade and lobby area were spared. When reconstruction of the building was complete, the rear half of the building was named Budig Hall, for then KU Chancellor Gene Budig. The name on the facade was altered to reflect the presence of three large auditorium-style lecture halls within the building: Hoch Auditoria.\nAllen Fieldhouse (1955–present).\nAllen Fieldhouse was dedicated on March 1, 1955, when the Jayhawks defeated in-state rival, Kansas State 77–67.\nSince February 20, 1994, the Jayhawks have lost only 14 regular season games in Allen Fieldhouse, a 263–14 record (.951). Since February 3, 2007, the Jayhawks have gone 227–9 (.962) at Allen Fieldhouse, as of April 17, 2021, one of the best home record in all of basketball.\nAllen Fieldhouse is also notorious for its noise level as well. On November 4, 2010, \"ESPN The Magazine\" named Allen Fieldhouse the loudest college basketball arena in the country, reaching sustained decibel levels over 120. On February 13, 2017, in a game against Big 12 opponent West Virginia, fans at Allen Fieldhouse broke the Guinness World Record for loudest crowd roar at an indoor sporting event with a roar of 130.4 decibels, which had been set by Kentucky on January 28 against Kansas.\nIn the DeBruce Center at the northeast corner of the building is the original document of the Dr. Naismith's Original 13 Rules Of Basketball, purchased at auction by the Booth family for $4.3 million on December 10, 2010.\nKansas won 69 consecutive games at the Fieldhouse between February 3, 2007, and January 17, 2011, until Texas ended the longest streak in NCAA Division I since 1992 with a 74–63 win against Kansas on January 22, 2011. This streak broke Kansas's previous school record of 62, which lasted from February 26, 1994, through December 18, 1998 (during which time, the Jayhawks, along with the remaining members of the Big Eight Conference merged with the remaining members of the Southwest Conference to become charter members of the Big 12 Conference). The Jayhawks also completed a 55-game streak between February 22, 1984, through January 30, 1988, which is a Big 8 record.\nHome game traditions.\nBefore the start of every Jayhawks home game, after the singing of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", it is a tradition to sing the alma mater, \"Crimson and the Blue\". While singing the alma mater, it is tradition for the students in attendance to put an arm over the shoulders of their neighbors and slowly sway side to side, lifting their arms over their heads as the last line of the song is sung. The song is concluded by the Rock Chalk Chant.\nPost-game, the band will play a rendition of the Kansas state song \"Home on the Range\", which the crowd will stand up for similar to the national anthem.\nAfter singing The Star-Spangled Banner, while the opposing team is being introduced, members of the student section take out a copy of the student-run newspaper, The \"University Daily Kansan\", and wave the paper in front of their faces, pretending to be reading it in an effort to show lack of interest in the opposing team. After the opponents are introduced, a short video is shown, detailing the history and the accomplishments of Kansas basketball. As the Jayhawks are introduced, the students rip up their newspapers and throw the confetti pieces of paper in the air as celebration. Whatever confetti remains is typically thrown in the air after the first basket made by the Jayhawks.\nIf an opposing player fouls out of the game, the fans will \"wave the wheat\", waving their arms back and forth, as a sarcastic good-bye to the disqualified player, to the tune of \"You Didn't Have Your Wheaties\", from a series of 1970s television commercials promoting Wheaties breakfast cereal. The same waving motion to the tune of \"A Hot Time in the Old Town\" follows a Jayhawk victory.\nIf the Jayhawks are leading comfortably near the end of the game, the crowd begins a slow version of the Rock Chalk Chant, which has become the signature tradition of Allen Fieldhouse. The chant can also occasionally be heard at neutral sites, such as arenas for the NCAA tournament and the nearby T-Mobile Center on the Missouri side of Kansas City which during the regular season serves as an alternate home arena.\nFans and students will also line up early for Late Night In The Phog, which is the first practice of the season. The practice is viewable to the public and includes skits with past players as the hosts.\nRivalries.\nKansas State.\nThe Jayhawks longest played rivalry is with cross-state rival Kansas State. The Jayhawks lead the series 203–94. The Jayhawks have dominated the series since 1984 holding a record of 86–12 in that time frame. K-State has not led the all-time series since 1922. The schools have met annually since 1912 and first played in 1907. Kansas leads in Lawrence 93–35, in Manhattan 81–48, and on neutral courts 29–11. The Largest K-State victory was by 27 points, 96–69, on January 20, 1979. The largest Kansas win was 45 points, 90–45, on March 10, 1955. K-State longest win streak was 5 games, which they achieved twice, from 1972 to 1974 and 1982–83. The longest winning streak from Kansas was 31 games from 1994 to 2005.\nMissouri.\nThe Jayhawks main rival has been Missouri for many years. The two teams first played in 1907. The two teams played every year until Missouri left the Big 12 for the SEC. The schools renewed the rivalry beginning in the 2021–22 season. The Jayhawks won the first game in the renewal of the rivalry 102–65. KU leads the all-time series 174–94. The Jayhawks largest victory was 47 points, 96–49, on December 28, 1977. Missouri's largest victory was 30 points, 99–69, on January 17, 1976. The Jayhawks longest winning streak was 14 games from 1910 to 1913. Missouri's longest winning streak was 9 from 1920 to 1922.\nWichita State.\nWhile not officially a rivalry, the Jayhawks have played cross-state opponent Wichita State 16 times. The teams most recently met in the 2023–24 season with KU winning 86–67. Kansas leads the all-time series 13–3. The Jayhawks' largest victory was a 49-point win in 1993. The Shockers' largest victory was a 14-point win in the second round of the 2015 NCAA Tournament. Wichita State has never won consecutive games against Kansas. The Jayhawks won five times in a row from 1989 to 1993. Wichita State won both games between the schools in the NCAA Tournament.\nPost-season results.\nRegular season conference championships.\nThe Jayhawks have won 62 conference championships since their inception, including an NCAA record 13 consecutive from 2005 through 2017. The Jayhawks have belonged to the Big 12 Conference since it formed before the 1996–97 season. Before that, the Jayhawks have belonged to the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association from the 1907–08 to 1927–28 seasons, the Big Six Conference from 1928–29 to 1946–47, the Big Seven Conference from 1947–48 to 1957–58, the Big Eight Conference from 1958 to 1959 up until the end of the 1995–96 season. The Big Six and Big Seven conferences were actually the more often used names of the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association, which existed under that official name until 1964, when it was changed to the Big Eight.\nMissouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association (13)\nBig 6/7/8 Conference (30)\nBig 12 Conference (20)\nConference tournament championships.\nThe Big Eight Conference did not regularly have a post-season tournament until after the 1977 season. Prior to that teams usually played in the Big Eight (before that, Big Seven) Holiday Tournament in December. The Holiday tournament ended after the 1979 season.\nBig Seven/Big Eight Holiday Tournament (13)\nBig Eight Conference (4)\nBig 12 Conference (11)\nNCAA Tournament seeding history.\nThe NCAA started seeding teams with the 1978 tournament, with the seeding format used today beginning in 1979. The Jayhawks were seeded for the first time in their 1981 tournament appearance. There was no tournament in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIndicates NCAA championship.\nNational Championships.\nThe Jayhawks have been awarded a combined 6 Championships, two Helms Championships and four NCAA Tournament National Championships. The Helms titles were awarded retroactively by the Helms Athletic Foundation in 1943. Some schools do not claim Helms championships, Kansas, however, does claim them and has a banner hanging for both in Allen Fieldhouse, along with their NCAA Tournament championships.\nNCAA Tournament National Championships.\n1952.\nThe Jayhawks 1951–52 team won the schools first NCAA Tournament Championship. They were coached by Phog Allen and finished the season with a 28–3 record.\n1988.\nThe 1987–88 team won the Jayhawks second NCAA Tournament championship. The Jayhawks were coached by Larry Brown. They finished the season 27–11, which is the lowest winning percentage (.710) and most losses of any team to win the national championship. The team remains the only championship team of the Jayhawks that did not win the regular season conference championship or the conference tournament championship.\n2008.\nThe 2007–08 team won the Jayhawks third NCAA Tournament Championship. They were coached by Bill Self and finished the season with a 37–3 record, which is a school record for wins in a season.\n2022.\nThe 2021–22 team won the Jayhawks fourth NCAA Tournament Championship, which is their most recent championship. They were coached by Bill Self and finished the season with a 34–6 record. The Jayhawks tournament run in 2022 is the only one since teams began being seeded that they did not play a single number 1 seed in the Final Four and National Championship game.\nComplete NCAA tournament results.\nThe Jayhawks have appeared in the NCAA tournament 52 times. Their combined record is 117–50. Their largest victory in a tournament game was a 58-point (110–52) victory over Prairie View A&amp;M in 1998, which is also the Jayhawks tournament record for most points scored in a tournament game. Their largest defeat in a tournament game was a 34-point defeat (51–85) against USC in 2021, which was also their lowest point total in the NCAA tournament total since the introduction of the shot clock in the 1985–86 season. They have been eliminated in the first round only six times since the beginning of the tournament, only two of those times have been since the tournament expanded to 64 teams. The Jayhawks have played in 11 overtime games in the NCAA Tournament and have a 6–5 record. Two of their overtime games went into multiple overtimes, both of which have been depicted in a film. Their 3 overtime game against North Carolina in the 1957 National Championship game was depicted in the film \"Jayhawkers\" and their double overtime loss to Texas Western in the 1966 Elite Eight, which was featured in the 2006 film \"Glory Road\".\nOnly four times in program history has Kansas failed to win a single game in the tournament and only twice since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985.\nLike most schools, Kansas rarely plays conference opponents in the tournament. The 1988 tournament was the only time they've ever played conference opponents. In that tournament they defeated rival Kansas State in the Elite 8 and Oklahoma in the national championship game.\nAppearances are grouped by the number of teams in the bracket. Round names are based on what round names were at the time of the tournament, not the present names. The term \"Elite eight\" began in 1956, \"Final four\" began in 1975, and \"Sweet Sixteen\" began in 1988.\nNIT results.\nThe Jayhawks have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) two times. Their combined record is 3–2.\nJayhawks of note.\nAll-time leaders.\nNo players appear in all three lists. Five players make two appearances. Due to them being the two most recent coaches, Bill Self and Roy Williams coached the most players on the list. However, three players from the 50s make appearances, including Wilt Chamberlain, despite only playing 48 games for the Jayhawks. Dajuan Harris Jr. is the only active player on these lists. Harris is, as of the end of the 2023–24 season, 4th in assists.\nAll-Americans.\nConsensus first team.\nKansas leads all NCAA teams with 32 consensus First Team All-American selections, 25 different players have received the honor.\n‡ indicates player has made at least 2000 points and 1000 rebounds in his college career.\nAcademic All-Americans.\n† indicates Academic All-American of the Year\nMcDonald's All-Americans.\nThe 50 McDonald's All-Americans listed below have played for Kansas.

Eight players honored played on one of KU's 5 championship teams. Thirty-three players have had their jersey retired by Kansas. One former announcer, Max Falkenstien, is honored with the retired jerseys as well. His number 60 was chosen because that was the number of years he was the radio announcer for the Jayhawks. Charlie T. Black and Paul Endacott are the only two players with their jerseys retired to play on two championship teams. Four players from the 2008 Championship have their jersey retired, which is the most players honored to be on a roster in any single season in Kansas basketball history.\nJayhawks in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nTwenty members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame have been associated with the Kansas men's basketball team.

While still in college, he was signed by the Doves and played 73 games; it was very common in those days for college players to play in the major leagues as well. He then spent most of the next 16 years in the minors, seeing his only other major-league action in 1918. He started that season playing 22 games with the Tigers before being sold to the Red Sox in mid-August. He was listed as a possible replacement for the injured Dave Shean, but never got a chance to play in the World Series. Coffey is the only player to play with both Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth in the same season (1918 Tigers and Red Sox).\nIn two seasons, he played in 110 games and had 368 at bats with 33 runs, 69 hits, 5 doubles, 6 triples, 1 home run, 26 RBI, 6 stolen bases, 22 walks, a .188 batting average, .241 on-base percentage and a .242 slugging percentage.\nWhile still actively playing, he became the part-time coach at his alma mater, holding that post until 1918. He returned in 1922 as the school's first full-time coach and remained there until 1958 (Fordham did not field a team in 1944), amassing 1160 wins. The University's baseball field is named in his honor. From 1926 to 1958, he also served as athletic director.\nHe died in the Bronx, New York at the age of 79."

        "title": "Matt Anderson (baseball)",
        "text": "Matthew Jason Anderson (born August 17, 1976) is an American former Major League Baseball (MLB) relief pitcher. The first overall pick in the 1997 MLB Draft, he played for the Detroit Tigers and Colorado Rockies between 1998 and 2005.\nEarly life and college career.\nAnderson attended St. Xavier High School, which was also attended by MLB players Paul Byrd, Chris Burke, and Jack Savage. After high school, he went on to Rice University. In 1995, Anderson was a Southwest Conference all-star. In 1996, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and was named the league's top pro prospect. In 1997 he was a Western Athletic Conference all-star and a First Team College All-American. Anderson set Rice University records for career wins (30) and saves (14), and also posted a 1.82 earned run average (ERA) during his final year with the team. In the 1997 amateur entry draft, Anderson was selected first overall by the Detroit Tigers. He eventually signed with the team for a $2.5 million signing bonus.\nProfessional career.\nAnderson was named the 24th best prospect in 1998 by Baseball America. In 1998, he was called up by the Tigers from the minors, where he had an ERA under 0.70. In his first Major League season, he went 5–1 with a 3.27 ERA in 42 games. He also struck out 44 batters in 44 innings pitched. Anderson's numbers were never again as impressive as those of his rookie season, although he was able to record 22 saves (with a 4.82 ERA) in 2001.\nIn May 2002, Anderson tore a muscle in the armpit of his throwing arm while throwing a bullpen session. Earlier the same day, he had participated in a Tigers-sponsored fan octopus-throwing contest along with Jeff Weaver, leading to the perception (though disputed by Anderson) that he'd torn the muscle in hopes of winning Detroit Red Wings playoff tickets.

        "title": "Rugby Canada Super League",
        "text": "The Rugby Canada Super League (RCSL or Super League) was a national, semi-professional rugby union competition in Canada. The league represented the second level of domestic rugby union in Canada, and the highest level wholly indigenous to Canada. In terms of seniority it rested immediately beneath the IRB sponsored North America 4, a former US/Canadian cross-border competition in which two Canadian teams (Canada East and Canada West) took part. Most players took part in RCSL (\"Super League\") on an amateur basis.\nIn early 2009, after 11 seasons of play, Rugby Canada decided to disband the RCSL in the wake of the establishment of the Americas Rugby Championship, the successor to the North America 4. The RCSL was replaced by the Canadian Rugby Championship and the Rugby Canada National Junior Championship, which absorbed the majority of the RCSL teams.\nOverview.\nThe competition was established in 1998 and had been played on an annual basis. It is considered to be Canada's premier wholly domestic rugby competition. Players on Canada's senior men's team were often chosen from Super League clubs.\nThe Super League drew its teams from provincial unions. Larger unions (BC, Alberta, and Ontario) had more than one representative team; those teams were drawn largely from provincial sub-unions. For example, the Calgary Rugby Union and Edmonton Rugby Union are sub-unions of the larger Alberta Rugby Union and had both been given representation in the Super League.\nTeams were divided into Eastern and Western Divisions and played each of the other teams in their division once. The top team in each division played each other for the national championship.\nThe league rarely had identical membership from season to season, with teams who have membership occasionally electing not to play due to financial, logistical or level-of-play concerns. For 2006 season, the Fraser Valley Rugby Union of B.C. (\"The Venom\") and the Manitoba Rugby Union (\"The Buffalo\") elected not to participate, which created an unbalanced situation where the Western Division had five teams (therefore only four games in their season), while the Eastern Division had seven (six games)."

        "text": "The 900 is a 2½-revolution (900 degrees) aerial spin performed on a skateboard ramp. While airborne, the skateboarder makes two-and-a-half turns about their longitudinal axis, thereby facing down when coming down. It is considered one of skateboarding's most technically demanding tricks.\nPerformance by Tony Hawk.\nOn June 27, 1999, Tony Hawk, one of the most successful vertical pro skateboarders in the world, landed the 900 at X Games V after ten failed attempts. It was past regulation time but, as one announcer said, \"We make up the rules as we go along. Let's give him another try.\" Other skaters protested, but Hawk continued. Hawk twice landed on his board, but it flew out from under him. When he finally completed the trick, his arms windmilled and his hand barely grazed the ramp. Nonetheless, he rode away.\nIn his book, the 900 was the last on the wishlist of tricks Hawk had written a decade earlier. Other tricks on the list included the ollie 540, kickflip 540, and varial 720. In a 1999 interview, Hawk said he does not have \"any desire to spin further.\" He successfully landed the trick during press interviews for the video game \"\" and at the \"Tony Hawk: RIDE Presents Stand Up for Skate Parks\" event. In 2011, Hawk was still able to land the 900, and posted a video of the trick via his Twitter account, stating, \"I'm 43 and I did a 900 today.\" On June 27, 2016, Hawk was again successful.\nPre-Hawk.\nA number of opinions exist about pre-1999 900s. The most prominent of these is the argument that Danny Way landed the 900 in 1989, and it appears in an early Santa Cruz film. In 1999, Tony Hawk said:\nSuccessful landings.\nOn vert ramp.\nIn May 2020, 11-year-old Brazilian Gui Khury became the first person to land a 1080 using only a vert ramp.\nOn mega ramp (Big air).\nIn 2012, Tom Schaar landed a 1080 on his fifth attempt on the mega ramp.\nIn August 2019, Mitchie Brusco became the first person to land a 1260 (three full and one-half revolutions) in a Big Air competition at X Games Minneapolis.\nOther sports.\nThe 900 can also be attempted on a BMX bike, skis, snowboard, inline skates or a scooter. BMX rider Mat Hoffman was the first person to successfully land the 900 on film at a competition in Canada in 1989. In 2002 at X Games VIII, Hoffman took the trick a step further by landing a no-handed 900. BMX rider Simon Tabron's signature trick is the 900. In the 2007 at X Games XIII, Simon Tabron landed the first back-to-back 900s on a bike.\nBecause the gear of snowboarders, skiers, and inline skaters is affixed to their feet, the 900 is not considered to be a difficult trick for professionals in those sports and is performed comparatively often. 1620- and 1800-degree spins have been landed on skis, a 1620 has been performed on a snowboard as well as on inline skates, and a 1080 on BMX and on scooter."

        "text": "The Hawaii Rainbow Wahine volleyball team is the NCAA Division I women's volleyball team for the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. They are a member of the Big West Conference and are led by head coach, Robyn Ah M, Mow-Santos. The Rainbow Wahine volleyball program remains a large source of financial income for the University of Hawaii athletic department, notwithstanding even what football and men's basketball generates.\nGrandfathered in, and straddling the line between the two governing bodies of the AIAW and NCAA, Joyce Kapuaala-Kaapuni started with Hawaii in 1974 (alongside USAV's 1970 World's participant Beth McLachlin). She'd continue with her UH college career in 1982-83 forging first in the NCAA, winning back-to-back national championships.\nAs show, volleyball has always been a celebrated linchpin between islands. A token manifested, then, person being, Kawehi Ka'a'a (2x UHH First Team All-American) who'd participate in three Final Fours (AIAW, UHH, 1978 &amp; 1979 and AIAW, UHM, 1980). The follow-up was a Regional Final versus USC in the inaugural NCAAs, 1981. The UHM WVB program moreover frequently pays visits to Hilo and Kahului in competition during the spring. In 1974, for back-to-back matches somewhere between Sept.–Nov., it all began coincidentally on the island of Kaua'i, the eldest of all major-islands in the Hawaiian archipelago. \nThe team has won four national championships: one AIAW title and three NCAA Division I titles. The Rainbow Wahine played in the Big West Conference from 1988 to 1995. They joined the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) in 1996 and clinched at least a share of the regular-season conference title each year until 2012, when the Rainbow Wahine re-joined the Big West Conference. Hawaii won the WAC Tournament (and the WAC's automatic NCAA Tournament bid) in 1998 and every year between 2001 and 2011 except in 2010, when Hawaii lost in the tournament's final round to the Utah State Aggies. All four national championship squads have been team inducted into the UH Hall of Honor, of the Hawaii Athletics most prestigious, since 1981-82 (the NCAA's WVB birth).\nUnder the banner of 1987 Hawaiian Airlines, UH would capture the third placed Berkeley, CA, USAV Open Nationals title (of mid-May) this year. A Tita of UHM, being recognized as the consecutive all-tourney, had fallen to NorCal's Carlson Chrysler (1st place) and the American SW's Merrill Lynch (2nd).\nIn 1988, Major League Volleyball (MLV), the first all-female volleyball league in the United States, selected Swedish all-American player from the University of Hawaii, [Name of the player], as the number one overall draft pick for the Los Angeles Starlites. Following her tenure in MLV, she competed in the international beach volleyball circuit representing Sweden.\nBrigham Young University–Hawaii, which ceased its athletic programs in 2017, holds the distinction of being a ten-time National Champion, with its most recent title in NCAA Division II. It was also one of the few institutions in Hawaii to have defeated the University of Hawaii's Rainbow Wahine volleyball team, achieving this feat in 1992. Robyn Ah Mow-Santos, who would become the head coach at the University of Hawaii, played a pivotal role in revitalizing the team. Under her guidance, the team reached the NCAA Regional Final in Long Beach, California, in 1993.\nOn 21 October 1994, the Rainbow Wahine played their first match in the Stan Sheriff Center against the AVCA polled RV San Jose State Spartans. The Rainbow Wahine led the nation in home game attendance from 1995 to 2014, with a cumulative average of more than 6,800 fans per match, until the Nebraska Cornhuskers moved into the Devaney Center and began averaging over 8,000 fans at each home match.\nThe 1996 NCAA Division I women's volleyball tournament began with 48 teams (with a 12 team, six matches play-in meet) which ended on December 21, 1996, when Stanford defeated Hawaiʻi in the NCAA championship match. In the order of 3–0 sweeps, UH went over, routing, Colorado, Texas, BYU, Florida before succumbing 0–3, themselves, to the Cardinal. Retrospective this current 2017–present, Wahine-now leaders are the Head Coach, the Assistant Coach and the Director of Volleyball Operations (DoVO); perhaps not coincidentally they were the principled headwomen as athletes then.\nJunior #2-Susie Boogaard (2002–2005), iffy, informally, has the best season of her UH career. Averaging approximately 15 home matches per year, the parents of Boogaard had purchased tickets for unlimited flights, on annual passes by ATA Airlines, out of Los Angeles into Honolulu. The Ahuna's (1984–1987), reflexive, went Honolulu to the Continental U.S.\nIt would be also that in 2006, former player Kari Anderson (1991–94) moved into the associate head coach's position; she'd been an Assistant ever since '96-1997. She is still the longest tenured right-handed aide in UH WVB history. She'd retired from volleyball in early 2011.\nUHM is a perfect 24–0 against UH Hilo in their own state turf series, dating back to the mid-1970s. On September 12, 2009, the program notched its 1,000th victory with a 3–0 win over Stanford; this series favors UH 19–13. On December 11, 2015, the Wahine defeated seven-time national champions Penn State 3–0. Rarefied, NU(s'), of the great state consequentially of Nebraska, archives presenting the 8-8 HI-NE tie makes for Hawaiian celebratory tenor; the Rainbow and Cornhuskers wahine (beginning with 1975), both showstoppers, they codify the winner's tradition(s).\nOn 1989 December 8, 1989, a number one ranked Rainbow Wahine, quite objectively, referenced through annals which show those (that) analyzed statistically (e.g. kills, digs and percentages); they'd beat another AVCA Top 25 program in Cal Poly SLO, at Stockton, California, in the regional semifinal 15–9, 15–17, 9–15, 15–12, 15–12. Others via the official NCAA's history might suggest that the longest game of hours, between the #6 BYU Cougars and #7 UH, this manages \"ensured\" the best match chronicled with a UH win 15–12, 21–19, 13–15, 16–18, 24–22. This latter mentioned match occurred in the 1998 Las Vegas WAC Championships final. Of that 1998 post–season \"blossomed\" run into the NCAA Elite Eight, having incidentally been 1996 sophomore understudy to Coach Ah Mow at setter, Nikki (sept Ivarie's) Hubbert would appear and win the Family Feud game show versus the Couchois clan (2007).

        "text": "Bernard Ronald Wolfe (born December 18, 1951) is a Canadian businessman and former professional ice hockey player. Wolfe played 119 games over four seasons in the National Hockey League with the Washington Capitals from 1975 to 1979.\nEarly life.\nWolfe was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and is Jewish. His mother, Fay Wolfe, observed upon his becoming an NHL hockey player: \"Of course I would have preferred him to be a doctor, or some kind of professional man. But if Bernie is happy, then we're happy.\" His father, Mickey, had played goaltender for the Canadian Army team.\nWolfe attended, majored in financial management, and played hockey at Sir George Williams University in Montreal, where he was named the school's top male athlete. Playing for Sir George Williams, he was a Quebec University Athletic Association First Team All-Star goaltender in 1972 and 1974, and a CIAU First Team All-Star in 1974. He backstopped Sir George Williams to the 1974 Canadian CIAU University Cup championship game, losing to the Waterloo Warriors; Wolfe won the Major W.J. \"Danny\" McLeod Award, as Most Valuable Player of the national championship tournament.\nLater, while he was playing in the NHL, he took courses at George Washington University.\nBiography.\nSigned as a free agent in 1975 by the Washington Capitals, Wolfe played for four seasons before retiring in November 1979 at age 27. Playing in 40 games for the Capitals during the 1975–76 season, the second season in the franchise's existence, he set club records for seasonal goals against average (GAA) at 4.16, and consecutive scoreless minutes at 80:43; while these figures are not impressive, they were a major improvement from results during the Capitals' first season, when they recorded the worst single season record in the history of the NHL, including an all-time worst 446 goals against, with a fourth-all-time worst 5.58 team GAA. He showed flashes of brilliance and was a solid performer on a team that struggled in those early years. He retired with one year remaining on his guaranteed contract, saying he \"just didn't enjoy it anymore\". In 119 games, his record was 20-61-21, with 424 goals against, a 4.17 goals against average, and one shutout.\nWolfe retired from professional hockey in 1979 and began a financial planning practice. He earned his Certified Financial Planner designation in 1981. Bernard R. Wolfe &amp; Associates Inc., which in 2014 managed $14 billion in assets.\nIn 1992, the Capitals attempted to re-sign the 40-year-old Wolfe in order to make him the goaltender they would expose in the 1992 NHL Expansion Draft. League rules required every team to make a goalie available for the draft who had at least one game of NHL experience. The Capitals were unwilling to expose any of their three goalies – Don Beaupre, Jim Hrivnak, and Olaf Kölzig – that were currently under contract. Wolfe agreed to sign for the league minimum salary of $100,000 as a favor to general manager David Poile and owner Abe Pollin; well into his career as a financial planner, he promised to donate his salary to charity if his contract were approved. League president John Ziegler Jr. announced he was holding up approval, and summoned Poile to NHL headquarters in Toronto two days before the draft to explain himself. Poile took this as a sign the contract would be rejected, and signed Steve Weeks instead. Phil Esposito, who had recently become part owner of the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning, was quoted as saying about the incident: \"I didn't just pay $50 million for Bernie Wolfe. He wasn't any good when \"I\" played against him\".\nWolfe co-wrote a book, \"How to Watch Ice Hockey\" (1982), with journalist Mitch Henkin.\nWolfe was the president of the Washington Capitals Alumni Association from 1992 to 2007. In 1999, he had both of his hips replaced."

Australia's best result was tenth by Danny Kah in the 5000 metres speed skating.\nAustralia also participated in the demonstration sports of aerial freestyle skiing and short track speed skating.\nThere had earlier been hopes that Janine Shepherd would do well at these Olympics, but she was hit by a motorist and made a paraplegic while training for it.\nCompetitors.\nThe following is the list of number of competitors in the Games.\nAlpine skiing.\nMen's combined\nSpeed skating.\nThis was the sixth Winter Olympics for Colin Coates, having competed in every Winter Olympics since 1968. Although registered as a competitor, he was regarded by the AOC as an official. General manager and Chef de Mission Geoff Henke later said about this arrangement\nHe unsuccessfully tried to convince the Geoff to allow him to compete, saying \"No Colin, it's not on. Your own sport won't nominate you, and that's the end of it. You're training with the athletes, but not skating in the Games. You've known that since we left Australia\". After other rejected requests, he gave the impression of accepting the situation. \"I had the power to take his entry out, and probably that's what I should have done. But I trusted him. He knew that he was not to compete.\" Instead, when the event was on, he put on a uniform and skated his best time ever.\nAfter the race, Geoff ran on the ice without skates and reprimanded him:\nCoates wept in response. Colin then received congratulations for skating at six Olympics, including from the prime minister Bob Hawke. Geoff relented \"At that point, I settled for discretion rather than valour. I stopped going crook. The man was a public hero. He did the wrong thing by me, but his was an incredible performance, and nobody could ever take that away from him.\""

        "text": "The West Indies cricket team toured Australia in October and November 2005 as part of the 2005–06 Australian cricket season. The West Indian cricket team will be looking to prove that they can perform against the number one rated side in the world. Australia on the other hand will be looking to build on their World XI performance and prove their Ashes critics wrong - and after winning the first two Tests by convincing margins, the Australians secured the series win to retain the Frank Worrell Trophy for the sixth time running. The West Indies were looking to avoid the series whitewash for the second consecutive time, and posted their highest total of the series in the first innings of the third Test, with Brian Lara making 226 to pass Allan Border as the all-time highest scorer in Test cricket.\nSquads.\n\"Note:\" \nTest series.\n1st Test.\nAustralia as expected ran out comfortable winners in the first Test. Mike Hussey on his debut made just one run in his first innings - his only single-figure score on tour. Ricky Ponting was the highest scorer of the Australian first innings, notching up 149 runs before being dismissed by Jermaine Lawson. Adam Gilchrist (44), Shane Warne (47), Brett Lee (47) and Nathan Bracken (37) all did well lower down the order to bring the Australian first innings total to 435. Corey Collymore was the standout bowler for the West Indies taking 4 for 72. The West Indies reply was stunted as five batsmen were out in single figures to Warne, with Devon Smith making 88, but the West Indies lost their last eight wickets for 76 to end with 210 - with Brian Lara given out for 30 lbw to Brett Lee, despite replays indicating to commentators that the ball was going on to miss the stumps. Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne shared the other wickets, McGrath removing the top of the order and Warne getting the better of the tail and also dismissing Shivnarine Chanderpaul, the captain, for 2. In Australia's second innings the West Indies only managed two wickets, thanks to part-time off spinner Chris Gayle who took 2 for 74 - the other bowlers were wicketless, and Australia made 283 for 2 before declaring at the end of the third day. Mike Hussey was dismissed for 29 in his second Test innings, while Matthew Hayden made a century for the third Test running with 118. Captain Ricky Ponting also passed the hundred mark, his second hundred of the game - the first time Ponting has achieved this in Test match cricket. Put in to bat on the fourth morning, the West Indies needed to chase down a total of 509 to win the match, which would be a record victory in the history of Test cricket if they were to do so. However, with the top score of the innings being Gayle's 33, and only four players making it into double figures, they fell well short. Nathan Bracken took 4 for 48 including the prize wicket of Brian Lara, while Brett Lee took 5 for 30 including the wickets of Devon Smith, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Denesh Ramdin, Corey Collymore and Jermaine Lawson as the West Indies surrendered in 49 overs to lose the match by 379 runs.\n2nd Test.\nThe West Indies lasted one day longer at Hobart than in the first Test at Brisbane, but still lost to surrender the series with a game to play, despite winning the toss and elected to bat first. Chris Gayle made 56 before he was given out lbw to a ball missing leg stump, while Shivnarine Chanderpaul made 39 but other than that, no batsman managed to pass 15, and six batsmen were dismissed in single figures. Brian Lara made 13 but was again given out lbw to a Brett Lee yorker. Gayle enjoyed a slice of luck during his half-century, as he was caught off a no-ball bowled by Andrew Symonds, who went wicketless. Glenn McGrath was the pick of the bowlers with 4 for 31 from 23 overs, while Brett Lee and Stuart MacGill shared the remaining six wickets. Australia's first-wicket partnership of Matthew Hayden and Mike Hussey then outscored the entire West Indies innings, and well more, as they went on to make 231 before Collymore had Hayden caught. Hayden made 113 and Hussey made his maiden Test century before being caught off the bowling of Dwayne Bravo for 137 - having batted for 388 minutes. Brad Hodge made 60 in his first Test innings, while the other batsmen were dismissed for scores below 25, as the Australian innings totalled 406. Fidel Edwards got the most wickets, with three for 116 including skipper Ponting and Michael Clarke, while Dwayne Bravo and Corey Collymore got two wickets each - Collymore tying the Australians down with 11 maiden overs and an economy rate just below two. Yet, the West Indies lost their first six wickets for 140, needing 117 to avoid yet another innings defeat before Dwayne Bravo and Denesh Ramdin added 182 for the seventh wicket - both making their highest career scores with 113 (Bravo) and 71 (Ramdin). Brian Lara made 45 before he was given out caught behind Adam Gilchrist off the bowling of Shane Warne - with there being a sound, the ball could have hit bat or pad, but the umpire was convinced it hit bat first and gave Lara out. Glenn McGrath was again economical, picking up 2 for 29 off 25 overs. Brett Lee took 2 for 99, Stuart MacGill took 2 for 69 and Shane Warne took 4 for 112 in the West Indies total of 334 - after Ramdin went, breaking the partnership, the last three wickets yielded 12 runs. Australia needed 78 runs for victory and they got their comfortably with the only minor fault in their innings was Matthew Hayden, who was caught at cover, a fielding position in the outfield, by Devon Smith off the bowling of Chris Gayle, as Australia were on nought for 77 and only needed a single for victory. Gayle finished up with figures of 1 for 16 from 6 overs, once again the only bowler to take second-innings wickets. In front of a fifth-day crowd of 800 - most preferred to watch the run-chase on TV - Mike Hussey was left to hit the winning run as Australia went on to win by nine wickets. (CricInfo scorecard)"

        "title": "Skeleton sport in Australia",
        "text": "Australia created a female team in the sport of skeleton in the hope of winning a medal at the 2006 Winter Olympics. Physiologists Dr David Martin and Dr Angus Ross looked at a list of winter sports. They regarded the women's division of the sport as not currently being strongly competitive, therefore athletes in non-winter sports who possess the traits that would make a good skeleton athlete could win a medal.\nAlmost 100 athletes from a variety of sports, including athletics and Surf lifesaving sports, were invited to be tested by the Australian Institute of Sport for their suitability in the sport. \nThe tests included their ability to sprint over 30 metres, body type and attitude. Training included practicing starts using a skeleton sled with wheels underneath. 35 people were selected for a training camp, and 10 comprised a squad that competed in the sport internationally.\nThe athletes tested their wind resistance in Monash University's wind tunnel to see which body positions would be the most aerodynamic. The university's aerodynamicist said that the testing enabled the athletes to reduce drag by between five and ten percent.\nFive athletes were selected for the shadow team.\nMichelle Steele was selected for Australia's women's slot after time trials in Königssee, Germany. She came 13th at the 2006 Winter Olympics. Boyle also competed at the 2006 Games, finishing 22nd in the men's event.\nAnother recruitment drive occurred in mid-2006. Candidates will be assessed on spatial and body awareness, useful in driving a sled, as well as sprinting ability. Ten candidates will attend a training camp, and up to five will join Steele, Lincoln-Smith and Hoar in the national squad.\nThree Australian sliders competed at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver: Anthony Deane, who finished in 23rd place in the men's competition, Lincoln-Smith, who placed 10th in the women's event, and Hoar, who finished 12th in the women's event. The best results for Australians in top-flight skeleton competition as of mid-2013 were Steele's sixth place at the FIBT World Championships 2013 and second places for Lincoln-Smith and Lucy Chaffer during the 2011–12 Skeleton World Cup."

        "title": "John Williams (basketball, born 1966)",
        "text": "John Sam Williams (born October 26, 1966) is an American former basketball player who played professionally for several seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Liga ACB.\nHis girth earned him the nickname \"Hot Plate\" Williams, in part to help distinguish him from John \"Hot Rod\" Williams of the Cleveland Cavaliers who likewise played college basketball in Louisiana (at Tulane University) and who also entered the NBA in 1986.\nDespite his size, in which he ballooned to close to 260 pounds by the time he was drafted, Williams was a highly skilled basketball player. He was in particular an exceptionally good passer, and averaged over 4 assists per game in 3 separate seasons, an excellent average for a player his size. He was frequently used as a point forward, handling the ball and conducting the offense.\nCollege career.\nWilliams played collegiately for LSU, and was drafted into the National Basketball Association by the Washington Bullets in 1986 with the 12th overall pick.\nProfessional career.\nAs a rookie, Williams averaged just under ten points and five rebounds per game for the Bullets. He improved significantly his second season, and started 37 of 82 games. The 1988–89 NBA season, his third, was clearly his best, as he achieved career-high season totals in almost every statistical category, despite coming off the bench in all but one game.\nWilliams' productivity declined in the five injury-plagued seasons that followed. He missed more than half of four of those five seasons due to various injuries, which, though not necessarily caused by his weight, were certainly aggravated by it. His eight-year NBA career included five seasons with the Bullets, two with the Los Angeles Clippers, and one (his final season) with the Indiana Pacers. He left the NBA in 1995, but went on to play 132 games over 6 seasons in the Spanish Liga ACB, averaging 15.6 points and 7.3 rebounds.\nWeight issues and player profile.\nWilliams' eating problems and weight issues were as a result of stress and depression. By the time he entered the draft, he lost his grandmother, two childhood friends, while supporting his mother, grandfather, and children from previous marriages. His weight issues got so bad that Bullets and Clippers put him on weight reduction programs, and suspended him with no pay.\nBy the time he played for the Pacers, his offensive skills and court vision had not diminished, but his vertical leap and stamina suffered significantly due to his weight, making him a defensive liability. At his lowest weight, he managed to drop to 235 lbs, but he gained weight back up to about 260 lbs."

        "text": "Rugby league is a minor sport in Germany. The national governing body for the sport, Rugby League Deutschland, is an associate member of the Rugby League European Federation. The country's national team are regular competitors in the European Shield, winning the competition in 2006 and 2011.\nHistory.\nRugby league was introduced into Germany in August 2004 with the formation of Rugby League Deutschland by Simon Cooper who was born in Halifax, England whose father is German. Prior to that it had been played informally by expat players associations such as British servicemen and students.\nThe first ever game didn't take place until nearly 12 months later when on 23 July the Heidelberg Sharks beat München RLFC 72-64 in a 9-a-side game played in Heidelberg. Since then clubs Bad Reichenhall and Innsbruck have also played matches.\nIn 2005 there was the first match between a Germany XIII and a touring Scottish Students side. This was a catalyst for Germany entering in 2006 in their first full international tournament the Central Europe Development Tri-Nations and then subsequently in the European Shield in 2007 and 2008.\nIn 2011, Rugby League Deutschland was admitted to affiliate membership of the Rugby League European Federation after reforms to its governance.\nPopularity.\nThe popularity of rugby league in Germany is small, and rugby of any form is still very much unknown by Germans. 80 adult players and around 200 children were introduced to the game in 2008.\nBundesland of Origin.\nIn 2007 a State (Bundesland) of Origin style concept has also been introduced with two regional teams representing Bavaria and Central Germany. The weekend of this game is also used to bring everyone together for a training session and for the Coach and selectors to see all players in one place and also to have a meeting. The first such game was played in 2007 in Nürnberg.\nNational team.\nThe current captain of the national side is Brad Billsborough and the coach is Bob Doughton.\nAs well as playing friendlies and one-off games, the German national team has participated in two tournaments. In the 2006 Germany participated in the Central Europe Development Tri-Nations along with Austria and Estonia. Germany won both of their matches narrowly beating Austria in Bad Reichenhall in front of over 350 people. They then travelled to Tallinn and beat Estonia to seal victory and outright first place of the competition.\nIn 2007 they took part in the RLEF European Shield along with the Czech Republic and Serbia. In this tournament they took out second place. They were beaten in Heidelberg by a strong Serbia side but recovered and beat a tough Czech Republic team in Prague by 22 points.\nIn 2008 Germany will once again be participating in the RLEF European Shield with the Czech Republic and newcomers Italy. Serbia were promoted to a group with Russia and Lebanon on their strong performance in 2007. The games will be held in Padova, Italy, Prague, Czech Republic and Frankfurt, Germany. There are also games proposed against Serbia and an RLEF XIII, but are yet to be confirmed.\nThe first weekend of August each year is being set aside for a game against the Czech Republic, no matter if facing each other in a tournament or not. Also plans are to have friendlies against Austria, though in 2007 this game fell through.\nResults of the German National Team.\nSome results for Germany in Rugby League (XIII).\n2006.\nCentral Development Tri-Nations\n2007.\nRLEF European Shield Tri-Nations\n2008.\nRLEF European Shield Tri-Nations\nOther games\nGerman State of Origin\nPlayers that have represented Germany.\nAt the moment the criteria for representing Germany is to have played in one of the domestic teams or the German Exiles. The current list is of staff and players that have played for Germany in the full internationals."

        "title": "William Andrews (American football)",
        "text": "William Andrews (born December 25, 1955) is an American former professional football player who was a running back for the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL). He played collegiately at Auburn University along with future NFL backs James Brooks and Joe Cribbs.\nAndrews was selected by the Falcons in the third round of the 1979 NFL Draft. While he was primarily used as a blocking back in college, Andrews excelled as a blocker, runner and pass catcher during his pro career. He would make an immediate impact, finishing with 167 yards rushing in his NFL debut as the Falcons defeated the New Orleans Saints, 40–34. Playing in 15 games, Andrews finished his rookie season with 1,023 yards rushing and was named to the all-rookie team. In 1980, Andrews helped lead the Falcons to a 12–4 record and a first-place finish in the NFC West division. He finished the season with 1,308 yards rushing, averaged 4.9 yards per attempt and also caught 51 passes for 456 yards. The season was the first of four straight in which Andrews was selected to play in the Pro Bowl.\nWhile the Falcons record slipped in 1981, Andrews would have another great season. He led the NFL in yards from scrimmage with 2,036, again went over 1,300 yards rushing and scored a career-high 12 touchdowns (10 rushing, 2 receiving). Andrews became one of the first running backs in the NFL, along with Tony Dorsett, John Brockington, Ottis Anderson and Earl Campbell, to gain at least 1,000 yards in each of his first three seasons. Andrews was also fourth in receptions that season with 81. Andrews finished the strike-shortened 1982 season second in the NFL in yards from scrimmage with 1,076 and helped the Falcons return to the postseason.\nIn 1983, Andrews had his best season yet statistically. He was second in the NFL in rushing with 1,567 yards, second in rushing yards per game with an average of 97.9 and caught for 59 passes for 609 yards. His also finished second in yards from scrimmage with a total of 2,176. At season's end, he was named All-Pro by both the NEA and The Sporting News.\nIn the prime of his career, Andrews sustained a serious knee injury during the 1984 preseason that sidelined him for two years. He returned in 1986 for one season, largely as a tight end. He rushed for 214 yards on 52 attempts and scored 1 touchdown before retiring from the NFL with a career total of 5,986 yards rushing. At the time of his retirement, Andrews ranked 24th in NFL history in rushing yards.\nIn his prime, Andrews was regarded as arguably the most bruising, powerful running back in the NFL. Ronnie Lott would later state that a head-on-collision he had with Andrews during a game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Falcons on December 19, 1982, was the hardest hit that he had received during his NFL career. In addition to leading the NFL in yards from scrimmage in 1981, Andrews also finished in the top four in that category three other times. He was named as the Falcons Player of the Year in both 1981 and 1983. Andrews was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1996."

        "title": "New Wimbledon Theatre",
        "text": "The New Wimbledon Theatre is situated on the Broadway, Wimbledon, London, in the London Borough of Merton. It is a Grade II listed Edwardian theatre built by the theatre lover and entrepreneur, J. B. Mulholland, who at the time was also owner of the King's Theatre in Hammersmith and had owned the Theatre Metropole in Camberwell in the 1890's . Built on the site of a large house with spacious grounds, the theatre was designed by Cecil Aubrey Massey and Roy Young (possibly following a 1908 design by Frank H. Jones). It seems to have been the only British theatre to have included a Victorian-style Turkish bath in the basement. The theatre opened on 26 December 1910 with the pantomime \"Jack and Jill\".\nThe theatre was very popular between the wars, with Gracie Fields, Sybil Thorndike, Ivor Novello, Markova, and Noël Coward all performing there. Lionel Bart's \"Oliver!\" received its world premiere at the theatre in 1960 before transferring to the West End's New Theatre. The theatre also hosted the world premiere of \"Half a Sixpence\" starring Tommy Steele in 1963 prior to the West End.\nWith several refurbishments, most notably in 1991 and 1998, the theatre retains its baroque and Adamesque internal features. The golden statue atop the dome is Laetitia, the Roman Goddess of Gaiety (although many refer to her as the theatre's \"angel\") and was an original fixture back in 1910. Laetitia is holding a laurel crown as a symbol of celebration. The statue was removed in World War II as it was thought to be a direction finding device for German bombers, and replaced in 1991.\nThe theatre is close to Wimbledon rail, tube, and tramlink station, and a short walk from South Wimbledon tube station.\nVenue statistics.\nThe theatre has approximately 1,670 seats across three levels, making it the eighth largest theatre in London following the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, the English National Opera's London Coliseum, and the major musical venues the London Palladium, Apollo Victoria, Drury Lane, Dominion, and Lyceum.\nWimbledon Studio.\nThe main auditorium is adjoined by the smaller black box space of the Time and Leisure Studio, a flexible space seating up to 80 people. It is often home to small drama and comedy productions, often prior to West End or Edinburgh Festival runs each summer. Up From Paradise, the only musical written by Arthur Miller, directed by Patrick Kennedy received its London premiere at the Studio in July 2014 following a successful year of musical programming.\nRecent history.\nUntil 2001, the theatre was owned and operated by the Wimbledon Civic Theatre Trust, on behalf of the London Borough of Merton, who still own the freehold of the building. The trust was responsible for overseeing a multimillion-pound refurbishment in the late 1990s, incorporating a brand new backstage area, fly tower, and a complete re-seating of the orchestra stalls as well as redecoration of the interior. During this period, the theatre was closed for an entire year.\nThe venue fell into severe financial difficulties in 2003 and was forced to close. Following lengthy talks between leading producers, local councillors, and companies, in autumn 2003 a deal was agreed for the theatre to be managed by the Ambassador Theatre Group (ATG).\nFollowing a name change to the New Wimbledon Theatre, the venue reopened in February 2004 with Matthew Bourne's production of \"The Nutcracker\" followed by a season of touring musicals, dance, and ballet, culminating in the London revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber's \"Cats\".\nIn November 2005, the theatre saw the launch of a new UK pantomime company, First Family Entertainment with their flagship production being \"Cinderella\" starring Susan Hampshire, Richard Wilson, John Barrowman, Naomi Wilkinson, Peter Duncan, and Tim Vine. In 2006, the theatre welcomed its first Hollywood star in the shape of \"Happy Days\"' Henry Winkler. Subsequent Christmases have seen global stars including Pamela Anderson, Warwick Davis, Edna Everage, Linda Gray, David Hasselhoff, Priscilla Presley, Jerry Springer, and Ruby Wax, alongside British household names including Brian Blessed, Jo Brand, Bobby Davro, Anita Dobson, Gareth Gates, Ross Kemp, Alistair McGowan, Paul O'Grady, Joanna Page, Wayne Sleep, Louie Spence, Claire Sweeney, and Tim Vine.\nThe theatre has since played host to a large variety of major touring productions, plus the UK launch of Josef Weinberger's UK collection of Disney musicals available to amateur companies throughout the British Isles. In 2010, the national tour of \"Spamalot\", the musical based on the film \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\", opened at the New Wimbledon.\nTelevision usage.\nThe venue is frequently hired out for television production, with many television series having been shot at the location, including \"The Optimist\", \"The Bill\", \"The IT Crowd\", \"De-Lovely\", \"Little Britain\", \"Extras\" (the Aladdin pantomime episode with Les Dennis), Jonathan Creek and \"We Are Most Amused\", a comedy gala performance to celebrate the 60th birthday of The Prince of Wales, in aid of The Prince's Trust.\nNotably, the venue was the home of annual televised Christmas pantomimes, including:\nThe Real Full Monty (ITV1 2023)\nTouring productions.\nTouring shows that have visited Wimbledon over the years include:\n\"Cats, Starlight Express, We Will Rock You, Sister Act, Monty Python's Spamalot, Avenue Q, Shrek the Musical, Chicago, The Sound of Music, Riverdance, Waitress, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, 9 To 5, Rock of Ages, Dirty Dancing, Beauty and the Beast, School of Rock, Singin' in the Rain, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, West Side Story, Jesus Christ Superstar, , Thoroughly Modern Millie, The Rocky Horror Show, Fame – The Musical, Priscilla Queen of the Desert – the Musical, Saturday Night Fever, Carousel, Footloose – The Musical, Grease, Anything Goes, Flashdance – The Musical\" and \"An Inspector Calls\"'.\"\nIt has also been home to residencies of many Matthew Bourne productions including \"Swan Lake, The Nutcracker, Edward Scissorhands, The Car Man, Highland Fling\" and \"The Red Shoes\".\nCultural references.\nThe New Wimbledon Theatre is featured in \"Final Curtain\", Series 5 Episode 2 of the BBC TV program New Tricks"

        "text": "The Association of Cricket Umpires and Scorers (commonly abbreviated as the ACU&amp;S) was established in 1953 by the umpire Tom Smith as the Association of Cricket Umpires (the scorers were included in the title several years later), in order to provide training and advice to cricket officials. It had a membership exceeding 8,000 in countries all over the world before it was merged with the ECB Officials Association on 1 January 2008.\nThe ACU&amp;S also had the duty of assigning qualified umpires and scorers to cricket matches around the world. It was funded by membership fees, sponsorship, advertising in its quarterly newsletter \"How's That,\" and the profits from selling official umpire and scorer accessories and clothing.\nMerger.\nIn December 2007, the membership of the ACU&amp;S voted (67% for, 33% against on a low turnout) to merge with the ECB Officials Association [ECB OA]. This ended a period of uncertainty during which various claims were made both about the Association's financial stability and its internal governance. This new organisation eventually became the ECB Association of Cricket Officials. The move was criticised by some who viewed it a cynical move by the ECB as a means to secure additional funding by Sport England as well as by overseas members who believed that an organisation under the auspices of the ECB would not have the same interest in them as the ACU&amp;S, which had supported members across the world. Supporters of the merger argued that integration with the ECB would raise the profile of umpiring and scoring, provide much needed funds, improve training and put an end to the multitude of official bodies that had begun after alleged irregularities in administration had come to light. This aspiration to improve training must sound rather hollow now ECB no longer examines candidates for knowledge of the Laws of Cricket. 5 Gloucestershire Association of Cricket Umpires and Scorers minutes 18 November 2017.\nAssociation textbook.\nThe textbook, \"Cricket Umpiring and Scoring\", was first published in 1957 under the authorship of Colonel Rowan Rait Kerr. Later editions were edited by Tom Smith, MBE. Later revisions were undertaken by Sheila Hill, MBE, and Robbie Robins in about 1992, when the name was changed to \"Tom Smith's Cricket Umpiring and Scoring\" at the suggestion of Colin Pearson as a permanent honour to the founder. The changes to the Laws of cricket in 2000 required a substantial re-write and this was undertaken by Colin Edwards, Graeme Lowrie (NZ), and Graham Cooper. The new edition was published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson in 2004.\nShortly before merging to form the ECB ACO, the copyright to the textbook was transferred by the ACU&amp;S to Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), who continue to update it; Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson also continue to publish it."

Francis was also an exceptional athlete in track and field and placed fourth in the shot put at the 1936 Summer Olympics.\nFrancis was the first overall selection in the 1937 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles. His rights were traded to the Chicago Bears in exchange for Bill Hewitt and $4,000 in cash on February 15, 1937. He played in the NFL for four years with the Bears, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Brooklyn Dodgers before leaving to get a master's degree at the University of Iowa and serve in the Army during World War II.\nAfter gaining experience serving as head coach for the football team at Camp Lee during World War II, Francis was hired as the head football coach at Kansas State University for the 1947 season.

        "text": "John Albert McKenzie (December 12, 1937 – June 9, 2018) was a Canadian professional hockey player and coach. He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for several seasons, most notably with the Boston Bruins, with whom he won the Stanley Cup twice. He also played several seasons in the World Hockey Association (WHA).\nPlaying career.\nMcKenzie's former teammate Gerry Melnyk dubbed the young player \"Pieface\" for his resemblance to a cartoon figure of the same name featured on the wrapper of a popular Canadian candy bar; this was later shortened to \"Pie.\" He played junior hockey for three years with the St. Catharines Teepees of the OHA and led the league in goals and points in 1958.\nMcKenzie made his NHL debut in 1958–59 with the Chicago Black Hawks. The following season he moved on to the Detroit Red Wings, where he lasted two years. He was then demoted again to the minors, where he played most of three seasons in the American Hockey League with the Hershey Bears and the Buffalo Bisons, and was named to the league's First All-Star Team in 1963. He returned to the NHL and the Black Hawks in 1963–64, and two years later played for the New York Rangers for part of the 1965–66 season, halfway during which he was traded to the Rangers' arch-rivals, the Boston Bruins. McKenzie scored his first goal as a Bruin on January 20, 1966 in Boston's 4-3 home victory over Chicago.\nIt was with the Bruins that the 5-foot-9-inch, 170 pound (77 kg) right wing had the most productive seasons of his career. He became a star in the 1967-68 season, scoring twenty-eight goals and gaining a reputation as a pesky, relentless hustler. He scored twenty-nine goals each of the next two seasons, and was named to the Second Team All-Star in 1969–70. In the playoffs that year he scored seventeen points in fourteen games, fourth on the team after Bobby Orr, Phil Esposito and John Bucyk and did so again in 1971-72. His best season was 1970–71, when he scored 31 goals and 77 points in 65 games. All in all, McKenzie scored 169 goals in his seven years in Boston and helped the Bruins win two Stanley Cup titles, in 1970 and 1972.\nAt the end of the sixth and last game in the 1972 Stanley Cup finals, when the Bruins defeated the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden 3-0 to take the Cup, McKenzie skated to center ice, raised one arm in mimicry of the Statue of Liberty, placed his other hand around his neck to appear as though he were choking, then jumped up and down in a circle several times. (Thus he implied, to the Rangers and their fans, that the Rangers had choked at their best chance of winning their first Stanley Cup since 1940). This became known as the \"McKenzie Choke Dance,\" or simply the \"choke dance.\"\nIn the summer of 1972, McKenzie was disgruntled at being left unprotected in the expansion draft, and he signed as player-coach with the Philadelphia Blazers of the newly formed World Hockey Association (WHA). In thirteen games he recorded only two wins and eleven losses, and he stepped down as coach in favor of veteran Phil Watson. He continued to play effectively for the Blazers, then for the Minnesota Fighting Saints, the Cincinnati Stingers and finally the New England Whalers. He finished his career in the WHA's final season in 1978-79, having played twenty-one seasons of professional hockey in the NHL and WHA.\nLater life.\nIn 2007, McKenzie served as the coach of the Berklee Ice Cats, the newly formed hockey team at Berklee College of Music in Boston. Following that, he was the liaison for hockey development at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.\nMcKenzie died at his home in Wakefield, Massachusetts, at age 80 on June 9, 2018, after a long illness."

        "text": "Steven Curtis Henderson (born November 18, 1952) is an American former Major League Baseball left fielder who is best remembered for being one of the players the New York Mets acquired in the infamous \"Midnight Massacre.\"\nCincinnati Reds.\nHenderson was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the fifth round of the 1974 Major League Baseball Draft out of Prairie View A&amp;M University. After leading the Eastern League with 158 hits, eleven triples and 255 total bases, and batting .312 in for the Reds' Double-A affiliate, the Trois-Rivières Aigles, he was batting .326 for the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians in at the time of his trade to New York.\nNew York Mets.\nTom Seaver was in a contract dispute with New York Mets chairman M. Donald Grant when on June 15, 1977, the Mets traded Seaver to the Cincinnati Reds for Pat Zachry, Doug Flynn, Dan Norman and Henderson, one of a series of trades that became known as the \"Midnight Massacre\".\nHenderson debuted with the Mets the following day as a pinch runner for Ed Kranepool, and his first major league run was the tying run in the Mets' 4-3 victory over the Houston Astros. On June 21, facing the Atlanta Braves at Shea Stadium, Kranepool hit a ninth inning home run off Andy Messersmith to send the game into extra innings. Following a one-out double by John Stearns in the 11th inning, the Braves intentionally walked Félix Millán to get to Henderson. The strategy didn't work, as Henderson connected for a three-run walk off home run.\nHe set a Mets rookie record, tied by Josh Satin in 2013, by reaching base in 29 consecutive games that he started.\nFor the season, Henderson had a .297 batting average in 99 games and 350 at-bats with twelve home runs, 65 runs batted in, 67 runs, 104 hits, sixteen doubles, six triples, six stolen bases, 43 base on balls, and four sacrifice flies. He finished second to Andre Dawson of the Montreal Expos in National League Rookie of the Year balloting by only one point (10–9).\nOn June 14, 1980, Henderson had perhaps his best moment in a major league uniform. The Mets had recovered from a terrible start to the season, going on a tear to approach the .500 mark. That day, facing the Giants, Mets' starting pitcher Pete Falcone was lit up, staking the Giants to a 5-0 lead, which later became 6-0. Still trailing 6-2 with two outs in the ninth, the Mets staged a highly improbable comeback, which ended with Henderson hitting a three-run home run to win the game 7-6 in the bottom of the ninth, pulling the team within a game of .500. The Mets resumed their losing ways immediately thereafter, as that day turned out to be the high point of the season.\nAccording to Henderson, he was at his best when he focused on getting hits, and suffered when he was pressured by the Mets to try to hit home runs. Henderson was not a natural power hitter, but the Mets were desperate for power at the time.\nOn February 28, , eager to make right with a fan base that had become disenchanted with the team, the Mets sent Henderson and cash to the Chicago Cubs in order to reacquire Dave Kingman, who had been traded away during the \"Midnight Massacre\". For his Mets career, Henderson batted .287 with 35 home runs and 227 runs batted in.\nChicago Cubs.\nHenderson batted .293 with five home runs and 32 runs batted in during the strike shortened season. His production fell off considerably the following season, as he batted only .233, and found himself sharing playing time in left field with Keith Moreland and Jay Johnstone. He was traded from the Cubs to the Seattle Mariners for Rich Bordi at the Winter Meetings on December 9, 1982.\nOakland A's.\nAfter two seasons in Seattle, Henderson and Kingman became teammates when Henderson signed as a free agent with the Oakland Athletics on March 31, 1985. Batting only .077 for the season, he was released by the A's on May 29, 1986.\nHe signed with the Chicago White Sox shortly afterwards, and spent the remainder of the season with their triple-A affiliate, the Buffalo Bisons, where he batted .288 with five home runs. The ChiSox released him at the end of the season. Henderson then signed again with the A's for 1987, and split the season between Oakland and their Triple-A affiliate, the Tacoma Tigers.\nHouston Astros.\nHenderson signed a minor league deal with the Houston Astros for . After splitting the season between the Astros and their Triple-A affiliate, the Tucson Toros, Henderson was released during the off season. He played the entire season with the Buffalo Bisons, who were now a Pittsburgh Pirates affiliate, before retiring.\nHenderson finished in the top ten in the National League in on-base percentage twice during his career.\nPost playing career.\nFollowing his retirement, he won the Senior Professional Baseball Association championship with the St. Petersburg Pelicans.\nHenderson served as a coach in the Pittsburgh Pirates minor league system from through . He moved to the Houston Astros organization in , and served as their hitting coach from to .\nHe moved to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays organization in , serving as hitting coach during their inaugural season and from to , making the first trip of his baseball career to the post season in . He was relieved of his duties as hitting coach of the Tampa Bay Rays on October 5, 2009. Henderson joined the Philadelphia Phillies in 2010 as an outfield/baserunning coordinator, and he spent 2011 and 2012 as the organization's hitting coordinator. On October 4, 2012, he was promoted to hitting coach for the major league team. He was fired by the Phillies after the 2016 season.\nHe and his wife, Pam, reside in Tampa, Florida.

        "title": "Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year",
        "text": "The Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year is awarded annually to the racing driver deemed to have been the best performing rookie in the Indianapolis 500. Criteria include drivers' performance during practice, qualifying, and the race, their relationship with fans and the media, their sportsmanship and positive impact on the race. Sportsmanship is a driver's relationship with fellow racers and fans, and media interaction is their availability to spectators and the press during the event. The Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) itself encourages voters of the award to treat each criterion equally. Competitors who outperform in their equipment during qualifying and the race, as well as those who led part of the event but retired for various reasons such as a mechanical failure or involved in an accident, can be given leeway by voters. The award is not always presented to the highest-finishing rookie, and it is not given if there are no rookie entrants. There is no current sponsor of the accolade; it has formerly been sponsored by Stark and Wetzel, American Fletcher National Bank, Bank One, Chase, and Sunoco.\nThe rules state that the driver must be a rookie who competes in qualifying and the race. Previous Indianapolis 500 racers and prize money winners are ineligible for the award at future events. According to earlier regulations, drivers were evaluated on their ability to follow United States Auto Club regulations, mental attitude, willingness to listen to advice from experts, actions to improve the welfare and safety of other competitors, and their own performance in qualifying and the race. In 1958, officials amended the regulations to make competitors who paid for or took part in prize money for one of the race's 33 starting spots eligible to compete for the award; this was done by redefining \"appearance\" in the rules following a two-car collision between Elmer George and Eddie Russo prior to the start of the 1957 race that resulted in differing opinions on whether the former was a rookie driver. The IMS disqualified drivers who crashed before the start of the 1958 Indianapolis 500 from competing for the accolade the following year.\nThe award was established before the 1952 Indianapolis 500 to reward rookie drivers for their performance in the race. Each year, after the race has ended, a small group of current and former media members, along with IndyCar Series and IMS officials, vote. They use a points-based voting system to choose their first and second choices. The winners' names are engraved on the Stark and Wetzel Rookie of the Year Award Trophy in the IMS Museum, and they receive $50,000 in cash and a cut glass trophy. The Herff-Jones company spent $6,000 to create the -tall trophy. It has an onyx base with sterling rest googles and a sterling plate featuring the name and year of each recipient is mounted on a central walnut shaft. A sterling bar in the shape of the IMS official emblem (wings sprouting from a racing tire) adorns the trophy's head. The trophy features the number 500 in gold and a gold race car going through the middle numeral. The award is presented after the race at the Victory Banquet in Indianapolis. Previous awards have included a plaque, a ring, and a year's worth of meat from Stark and Wetzel.\nThere have been 77 drivers who have won the accolade in the 71 years that it has been awarded. The first recipient was Art Cross in the 1952 race. It is typically given to one driver per year, but on five occasions it was awarded to two racers for their performance in a single race: Parnelli Jones and Bobby Marshman for 1961, Rick Mears and Larry Rice for 1978, Michael Andretti and Roberto Guerrero for 1984, Bernard Jourdain and Scott Pruett for 1989, and Alex Barron and Tomas Scheckter for 2002. American Lyn St. James became the first woman driver to win the award at the 1992 edition. Since then, two other women have won: Danica Patrick in 2005 and Simona de Silvestro in 2010. Juan Pablo Montoya (2000), Hélio Castroneves (2001) and Alexander Rossi (2016) are the three drivers who have won both the rookie prize and the race in the same calendar year. Josele Garza is the youngest winner of the award; he was 19 years and 70 days old when he won it after the 1981 event. The most recent winner was Benjamin Pedersen in the 2023 race.\nFastest rookie qualifier.\nSince 1975, the American Dairy Association Indiana (ADA) has presented the Fastest Rookie of the Year award to the fastest rookie qualifier regardless of starting position or four-lap average speed in order to welcome and celebrate, and honor each rookie entrant in the Indianapolis 500. The quickest rookie qualifier receives $10,000, a commemorative poster, and a plaque at the annual ADA Fastest Rookie Luncheon. The driver's name is also inscribed on the IMS Museum's permanent Fastest Rookie trophy. There have been 49 winners of the award. The first winner was Bill Puterbaugh in the 1975 race, and the most recent winner was Pedersen at the 2023 edition."

Brown had a quick progression to first choice first five-eighth, starting ahead of Bachop in 1995 NPC final.\nWith the launch of the Super 12 in 1996, Brown was rewarded with a place in the first ever Highlanders squad. With Bachop also selected in the Highlanders for 1996 it meant more time on the reserves for Brown. He made his debut in round two against Transvaal, starting at second five-eighth and scoring a try and two conversions. Brown went on to play four more matches in his debut Super 12 playing mainly at second five-eighth and was soon recognised at national level with selection for the New Zealand Colts and the New Zealand Māori. Brown went on to play 71 matches for Otago and 83 for the Highlanders before taking up a contract to play for the Sanyo Wild Knights in the Japanese Top League in 2005.\nAll Black.\nBrown was first picked for the New Zealand national rugby union team in 1999, making his debut in a match against New Zealand A on 11 June, before making his international debut against Samoa at Albany Stadium exactly a week later. Brown played a total of 18 test matches, scoring 171 test points (mostly with the boot, although he did score five tries) between then and his final test against Australia in August 2001. His international career included matches for New Zealand at the 1999 Rugby World Cup.\nBrown's goal-kicking feats enabled him to score over 30 points in three separate internationals (against Italy in 1999, Samoa in 2000, and Tonga in 2001) – the only player to have achieved this. Despite this he was never a member of the regular starting line-up, the fly-half position being held by Andrew Mehrtens during that period.\nSubsequent Playing career.\nJapan.\nHe went on to play three seasons (2005–06, 2006–07 and 2007–08) for the Sanyo Wild Knights in the Top League in Japan.\nIn the 2005–06 season he played in eight games and scored 98 points.\nIn the 2006–07 season he played in ten games and scored 145 points.\nIn the 2007–08 season he played 12 times and helped Sanyo to an unbeaten run of 13 wins in the season (the first time this had been achieved), to runner-up in the Microsoft Cup and All-Japan champion. He was the third highest points scorer with 137, and voted unanimously to the stand off slot in the Best Fifteen of the league. He was voted MVP by the fans in a J Sports poll.\nHe also played in friendlies for the Classic All Blacks against Japan XVs on 9 and 12 May 2007 and intended to return to Sanyo for the 2008–09 season.\nSouth Africa.\nIn 2006 Brown also played Super 14 in South Africa with the Sharks.\nHe returned to South Africa for the 2008 Super 14 season, having signed with the Stormers.\n2008 injury.\nIn October 2008, Brown suffered a freak injury while playing in Japan, which left him with a ruptured pancreas. He underwent successful life-saving surgery, which left his future rugby playing career in doubt. However, he recovered and returned to playing for Sanyo.\n2011 Return to the Highlanders.\nBrown was drafted into the squad as a reserve from the wider training squad for the match against the defending champions the Bulls. Coming on in the second half, he made a stellar contribution, converting 3 tries and kicking a crucial penalty.\nBrown was a key player in the Highlanders 26 18 upset win over the then 6 game undefeated Crusaders. Being on the eve of the 2011 Rugby World Cup the All Blacks were on look out for a back up first five to Daniel Carter, and with Browns recent form he had become a potential candidate for that position. If that were to ring true it would be more than ten years since Brown last played for the All Blacks. However the call up never came and Brown was later named as captain of Otago for the 2011 ITM Cup season.\n2020 Match Fit.\nIn 2020, he joined Match Fit season 1 as reinforcements since the first contact rugby warmup match against Pukekohe Presidents, and subsequently the final game against Classic Barbarians. At the time, he and Leon MacDonald were the only current coaches in the squad in season 1."

He was originally signed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an undrafted free agent in 2002. He played college football at North Carolina State. Smith also played for the San Francisco 49ers and Detroit Lions.\nBoating incident and disappearance.\nOn March 1, 2009, the United States Coast Guard reported that a fishing boat was missing off the Gulf Coast near Clearwater Pass, Florida. The boat was carrying four passengers, including Smith; Marquis Cooper, a member of the Oakland Raiders; as well as Nick Schuyler and Will Bleakley, former University of South Florida football players. The four men left Clearwater Pass on February 28 at 6:30 a.m. and were expected to return later that night. The Coast Guard Cutter USCGC Tornado began searching for the missing boat shortly after midnight on March 1, 2009. By 1:35 p.m. EST on March 2, 2009, the boat was located, overturned, with Schuyler clinging to it. The other three passengers were not found. According to Schuyler, Cooper separated from the group at 5:30 AM, with Smith disappearing about an hour later. 24 hours later, Bleakley became unresponsive, and despite Schuyler giving him CPR, he also disappeared. Schuyler was found less than six hours later. The search for the three men who remained missing ended at sundown on March 3, 2009. Friends and relatives organized a private search which was called off several days later.\nSmith's family has established the Corey D. Smith Memorial Scholarship Fund in his honor. The Detroit Lions held a memorial service for him on March 21, 2009.\nThe Detroit Lions announced they would retire Smith's #93 during the 2009 season in honor of him.\nAn investigation by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission determined that the incident was caused when the vessel was improperly anchored, and the boat capsized after one of the passengers tried to throttle forward in an attempt to pry loose the anchor.\nSmith was named the 2009 recipient of the Detroit Lions/Detroit Sports Broadcasters Association/Pro Football Writers Association's Media-Friendly \"Good Guy\" Award. The Good Guy Award is given yearly to the Detroit Lions player who shows consideration to, and cooperation with the media at all times during the course of the season. His family accepted the award on behalf of the late NFL player.\nMedia portrayal.\nSmith will be portrayed by Terrence Terrell in the upcoming film \"Not Without Hope\"."

        "title": "New South Wales Rugby League premiership",
        "text": "The New South Wales Rugby League premiership was the first rugby league football club competition established in Australia and contributor to today's National Rugby League. Run by the New South Wales Rugby League (initially named the New South Wales Rugby Football League) from 1908 until 1994, the premiership was the state's elite rugby league competition, parallel to Queensland's first-class league, the Brisbane Rugby League.\nFor most of the premiership's history it was contested by clubs from the state of New South Wales only, but later attempted to grow into a nationwide competition, eventually leading to the competition being played under the auspices of the Australian Rugby League in 1995. Despite this name, the 1995 and 1996 Australian Rugby League Premierships competitions were still administered by the Board and staff of the New South Wales Rugby League.\nHistory.\n1908: Rugby league premiership in Sydney.\nThe inaugural New South Wales Rugby Football League (NSWRFL) premiership began in 1908, and was made up of eight Sydney-based teams and one team from Newcastle. Cumberland joined the competition after the first round, meaning that they played one game fewer than the rest of the field for the season. Still known as the \"foundation clubs\" today, these nine teams battled against one another during the 1908 season, with Souths taking the first premiership honours after beating Easts in the Final.\n1909–1994: Expansion of the premiership.\nBetween 1912 and 1925 the premiers were decided by first past the post. As a result of South Sydney's dominant 1925 season, the NSWRFL introduced a finals system in order to maintain interest in the competition.\nOver the decades since the NSWRFL competition started, Sydney suburban teams came and went throughout its history but it was not until 1982 that the competition saw significant expansion outside of the Sydney area. The two new inclusions were from the Australian Capital Territory – the Canberra Raiders – as well as a team from the southern New South Wales region – the Illawarra Steelers. This corresponded with the adoption of commercial sponsorship of the competition for the first time, seeing it become the Winfield Cup (named after the popular cigarette brand).\nThe NSWRFL had also commenced a very popular and successful mid-week competition in 1973, originally known as the Amco Cup, but also as the Tooth Cup and the National Panasonic Cup. The success of this competition, which included teams from both Brisbane and New Zealand ultimately created pressure for further expansion of the NSWRL competition. In 1984, the New South Wales Rugby Football League changed its name to New South Wales Rugby League.\nIn 1988, for the very first time, two Queensland teams joined the competition, with the inclusions of the Brisbane Broncos and the Gold Coast-Tweed Giants. This saw the premiership competition move beyond the outer borders of New South Wales. At the same time, as a result of mounting pressure from the central coast of New South Wales, Newcastle returned to the competition with a new franchise. Their return saw the end of an 86-year wait in the wilderness and this time around the team was badged the Newcastle Knights.\nAfter mostly solid results were obtained by the expansion teams in 1988, there was increasing pressure for new inclusions into the competition. Having decided in May 1992 that a team from Auckland would join the premiership in 1995, the League announced in November that three more new clubs — a second team from Brisbane, and also a team each from Perth and Townsville — will also be invited.\nIn 1995, some seven years later, the competition expanded further into Queensland, with the inception of the South Queensland Crushers and the North Queensland Cowboys. 1995 also saw a new team in Western Australia, the 'Western Reds', later called the Perth Reds, as well as a New Zealand-based team – the Auckland Warriors. The total number of teams in the competition was now twenty – the largest-scale rugby league competition ever in Australia. The premiership's new national outlook was further reflected in the governing body's name, with the New South Wales Rugby League transferring control of the competition to the Australian Rugby League (ARL).\nSenior grade premiers.\nBetween 1912 and 1925 there was no semi-final system and a final was only played if two clubs finished level at the conclusion of the minor premiership. Souths won the 1909 premiership when Balmain forfeited in protest against the final being played as a preliminary match before a promotional game between the national Rugby League and Rugby Union sides. The 1937 season also featured no finals as the year was disrupted by the Kangaroos tour. Between 1926 and 1953 first played third and second played fourth and winners played off. If the minor premiers were defeated they had a right of challenge, but if they were not defeated there was no true \"grand final.\"\nFrom 1954 a mandatory grand final was introduced in which there was a knockout minor semi-final between third and fourth and a second-chance major semi between first and second. The winner of the major semi went to the grand final and a preliminary final was played between the winner of the minor semi and the loser of the major semi to decide who would meet the winner of the major semi.\nIn 1973 a final five was devised with the top team going straight into the major semi, the second and third teams playing a major preliminary semi, and the fourth and fifth playing a sudden-death minor preliminary semi. The top team played the winner of the major preliminary semi-final, whilst the winner of the minor preliminary semi played the loser of the major preliminary semi in the minor semi-final (which was played as before under the final four system.\nThird Grade.\nIn addition to Reserve Grade, there was a Third Grade competition contested from 1908 until the 1980s."

        "text": "The West Indies men's cricket team, nicknamed The Windies, is a men's cricket team representing the West Indies—a group of mainly English-speaking countries and territories in the Caribbean region—and administered by Cricket West Indies. The players on this composite team are selected from a chain of fifteen Caribbean nation-states and territories. , the West Indies cricket team is ranked eighth in Tests, and tenth in ODIs and seventh in T20Is in the official ICC rankings.\nFrom the mid-late 1970s to the early 1990s, the West Indies team was the strongest in the world in both Test and One Day International cricket. A number of cricketers who were considered among the best in the world have hailed from the West Indies: 21 of these have been inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.\nThe West Indies have won the ICC Cricket World Cup twice (1975 and 1979, when it was styled the Prudential Cup), the ICC T20 World Cup twice (2012 and 2016, when it was styled World Twenty20), the ICC Champions Trophy once (2004), the ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup once (2016), and have also finished as runners-up in the Cricket World Cup (1983), the Under 19 Cricket World Cup (2004), and the ICC Champions Trophy (2006). The West Indies appeared in three consecutive World Cup finals (1975, 1979 and 1983), and were the first team to win back-to-back World Cups (1975 and 1979), both of these records have been surpassed only by Australia, who appeared in 4 consecutive World Cup Finals (1996, 1999, 2003 and 2007) winning three consecutive World Cups (1999, 2003 and 2007).\nThe West Indies have hosted the 2007 Cricket World Cup and the 2010 ICC World Twenty20, and will co-host (with the United States of America) the 2024 ICC T20 World Cup.\nMember states and dependencies.\nThe current team represents:\nAffiliates in Cricket West Indies.\nCricket West Indies, the governing body of the team, consists of the six cricket associations of Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, the Leeward Islands, they are now getting Trinidad and Tobago, and the Windward Islands. The Leeward Islands Cricket Association consists of three cricket associations from two sovereign states (one from Antigua and Barbuda, and two from Saint Kitts and Nevis), three British Overseas Territories (Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, and Montserrat), one U.S. territory (the U.S. Virgin Islands), and one Dutch constituent country (Sint Maarten). The Windward Islands Cricket Board of Control consists of associations of four sovereign states (Dominica, Grenada, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines).\nTwo more British Overseas Territories in the region that have once been historical parts of the former West Indies Federation, the Cayman Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands, have their own national teams currently.\nNational teams also exist for the various islands, which, as they are all separate countries, very much keep their local identities and support their local favourites. These national teams take part in the West Indian first-class competition, the Regional Four Day Competition (earlier known as the \"Busta Cup\", \"Shell Shield\", \"Carib Beer Cup\", and various other names). It is also common for other international teams to play the island teams for warm-up games before they take on the combined West Indies team.\nThe combined population of these countries and territories is around 6 million people, comparable to fellow Full Members New Zealand and Ireland, and prominent Associate Member Scotland. Between 1928 and 2022 among the 385 men to play for West Indies, 67.8% hailed from either Barbados (98 players, 25.5%), Jamaica (83 players, 21.6%) or Trinidad and Tobago (83 players, 21.6%).\nThe member associations of Cricket West Indies are:\nHistory.\nThe history of the West Indies cricket team began in the 1890s, when the first representative sides were selected to play visiting English sides. The WICB joined the sport's international ruling body, the Imperial Cricket Conference, in 1926, and played their first official international match, granted Test status, in 1928, thus becoming the fourth Test 'nation'. In their early days in the 1930s, the side represented the British colonies that would later form the West Indies Federation plus British Guiana.\nThe last series the West Indies played before the outbreak of the Second World War was against England in 1939. There followed a hiatus that lasted until January 1948 when the MCC toured the West Indies. Of the West Indies players in that first match after the war only Gerry Gomez, George Headley, Jeffrey Stollmeyer, and Foffie Williams had previously played Test cricket. In 1948, leg spinner Wilfred Ferguson became the first West Indian bowler to take ten wickets in a Test, finishing with 11/229 in a match against England; later that same year Hines Johnson became the first West Indies fast bowler to achieve the feat, managing 10/96 against the same opponents.\nThe West Indies defeated England for the first time at Lord's on 29 June 1950. Ramadhin and Alf Valentine were the architects of the victory which inspired a calypso by Lord Beginner. Later on 16 August 1950, completed a 3–1 series win when they won at The Oval. Although blessed with some great players in their early days as a Test team, their successes remained sporadic until the 1960s when the side changed from a white-dominated to a black-dominated side under the successive captaincies of Frank Worrell and Gary Sobers.\nThe team won the inaugural World Cup in England in 1975, and retained the title in 1979. By the late 1970s, the West Indies led by Clive Lloyd had a side recognised as unofficial world champions, a reputation they retained throughout the 1980s. During these glory years, the West Indies were noted for their four-man fast bowling attack, backed up by some of the best batsmen in the world. In 1976, fast bowler Michael Holding took 14/149 in the OvalTest against England, setting a record which still stands for best bowling figures in a Test by a West Indies bowler. The 1980s saw the team set a then-record streak of 11 consecutive Test victories in 1984 and inflict two 5–0 \"blackwashes\" on England.\nThroughout the 1990s and 2000s, however, West Indian cricket declined, largely owing to the failure of the West Indian Cricket Board to move the game from an amateur pastime to a professional sport, coupled with the general economic decline in West Indian countries, and the team struggling to retain its past glory. Victory in the 2004 Champions Trophy and a runner-up showing in the 2006 Champions Trophy left some hopeful, but it was not until the inception of Twenty20 cricket that the West Indies began to regain a place among the cricketing elite and among cricket fans, as they developed ranks of players capable of taking over games with their power hitting, including Chris Gayle, Kieron Pollard, Marlon Samuels, Lendl Simmons, DJ Bravo, Andre Russell and Carlos Brathwaite. They beat Australia and then host Sri Lanka in the 2012 World Twenty20 to win their first ICC world championship since the 1979 World Cup and then bested England to win the 2016 World Twenty20, making them the first team to win the World Twenty20 twice. As an added bonus, the West Indies also became the first to win both the men's and women's World Twenty20 on the same day, as the women's team beat three-time defending champion Australia for their first ICC world title immediately beforehand. For the first time in the history of the tournament, the team did not qualify for the 2023 World Cup after losing to Scotland in the Super Six stage of the Qualifiers.\nFlag and anthem.\nMost cricketing nations use their own national flags for cricketing purposes. However, as the West Indies represent a number of independent states and dependencies, there is no natural choice of flag. The WICB has, therefore, developed an insignia showing a palm tree and cricket stumps on a small sunny island (see the top of this article). The insignia, on a maroon background, makes up the West Indian flag. The background sometimes has a white stripe above a green stripe, which is separated by a maroon stripe, passing horizontally through the middle of the background. Prior to 1999, the WICB(C) had used a similar insignia featuring a cabbage palm tree and an island, but there were no stumps and, instead of the sun, there was the constellation Orion. It was designed in 1923 by Sir Algernon Aspinall, then Secretary of the West India Committee. Around the same time in the 1920s the suggested motto for the West Indies team was \"Nec curat Orion leones\", which comes from a quote by Horace, meaning that Orion, as symbolical of the West Indies XI, does not worry about the lions [of English cricket].\nFor ICC tournaments, \"Rally 'Round the West Indies\" by David Rudder is used as the team's anthem.\nVenues.\nThe following eleven stadiums have been used for at least one Test match. The number of Tests played at each venue followed by the number of One Day Internationals and twenty20 internationals played at that venue is in brackets as of 2 April 2021:\nThree further stadia have been used for One Day Internationals, or Twenty20 Internationals but not Test matches. The number of One Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals played at each venue is shown in the table below:\nODI and T20I grounds.\nThe following four stadiums have been used for at least one international match other than Test matches.\nClothing.\nWhen playing one-day cricket, the Windies wear a maroon-coloured shirt and trousers. The shirt also sports the logo of the West Indian Cricket Board and the name of their suppliers Macron. The one-day cap is maroon with the WICB logo on the left of the front, with two yellow stripes.\nWhen playing T20I cricket, the team dons a yellow-coloured shirt with maroon-coloured sleeves, with two stripes of sky blue and yellow. The shirt also features the logo of the manufacturer along with the crest of the Cricket Board.\nWhen playing first-class cricket, in addition to their cricket flannels West Indian fielders sometimes wear a maroon sunhat with a wide brim or a maroon baggy cap. The WICB logo is on the front of the hat. Helmets are coloured similarly. The sweater was edged with Maroon, green and grey. Gold was added to the stripes in the early 2000s. The design reverted to a simple maroon facing when the West Indies began wearing fleeces. In 2020 they again wore the traditional cable knit sweaters edged with Maroon and Green. When the team toured they wore maroon caps but in test matches in the Caribbean, it was customary for the team to wear dark blue caps until the late 1970s. The blazers awarded for home tests were dark blue with white and green facings. An example is displayed in the museum at Lord's. After c 1977 home and away teams both wore maroon caps and the blazers were the same colours.\nDuring World Series Cricket, coloured uniforms were adopted. The initial West Indies uniform was pink and was later changed to maroon to match their Test match caps. Grey was also added as a secondary colour. In some of their uniforms grey has been dominant over the traditional maroon. Some uniforms had green, yellow or white as accent colour.\nFormer uniform suppliers were Castore (2019-2023), BLK (2017-2019), Joma (2015-2017), Woodworm (2008-2015), Admiral (2000-2005), Asics (1999 World Cup), UK Sportsgear (1997-1998), ISC (1992-1996) and Adidas (1979-1991).\nFormer sponsors were Sandals (2018-2021) Digicel (2005-2018), KFC (2006-2009), Cable &amp; Wireless (2000-2004), Carib Beer (1999-2001) and Kingfisher (1996-1999).\nWest Indies women's cricket team.\nThe West Indies women's cricket team enjoy a much lower profile than the men's team. They played 11 Test matches between 1975–76 and 1979, winning once, losing three times, and drawing the other games. Since then, they have only played one further Test match, a draw game against Pakistan in 2003–04. They also have an infrequent record in One Day Internationals. A team from Trinidad and Tobago and a team from Jamaica played in the first women's World Cup in 1973, with both sides faring poorly, finishing fifth and sixth respectively out of a field of seven. The Windies united as a team to play their first ODI in 1979, but thereafter did not play until the 1993 World Cup. The side has never been one of the leading sides in the world, however, since the 2013 World Cup, where the team finished runner-ups, the team has improved reasonably well. Their main success being achieving second place in the International Women's Cricket Council Trophy, a competition for the second tier of women's national cricket teams, in 2003. Their overall record in one-dayers is to have played 177, won 80, lost 91 with one tie and 5 no results .\nBecause of the women's side's relatively low profile, there are few well-known names in the game. The most notable is probably Nadine George, a wicket-keeper/batsman, who became the first, and to date only, West Indian woman to score a Test century, in Karachi, Pakistan in 2003–04. George is a prominent supporter of sport in the West Indies, and in particular, in her native St Lucia, and in 2005 was made an MBE by the Prince of Wales for services to sport.\n2016 saw the West Indies women win their first ICC world championship – the 2016 Women's World Twenty20, after beating three-time defending champion Australia by eight wickets at Eden Gardens with members of the men's team in the crowd to support.\nTournament history.\n\"A red box around the year indicates tournaments played within West Indies\"\nICC Champions Trophy.\nKnown as the 'ICC Knockout' in 1998 and 2000.\nStatistics and records.\nFor: 790 for 3 declared against Pakistan in Kingston in 1957–58; 751 for 5 declared against England in St John's in 2003–04; 747 all out against South Africa in St John's in 2004–05; 749 for 9 declared against England in Bridgetown in 2008–2009\nAgainst: 849 by England in Kingston in 1929–30; 758 for 8 declared by Australia in Kingston in 1954–55\nFor: 47 against England in Kingston in 2003–04; 51 against Australia in Port of Spain in 1998–99; 53 against Pakistan in Faisalabad in 1986–87; 54 against England at Lord's in 2000; 60 against Pakistan in Karachi in 2017-18 (60/9 (Surrender)) \nAgainst: 46 by England in Port of Spain in 1993–94; 51 by England in Kingston in 2008–09\n400 not out by Brian Lara against England at St John's in 2003–04; 375 by Brian Lara against England at St John's in 1993–94; 365 not out by Garry Sobers against Pakistan at Kingston in 1957–58; 333 by Chris Gayle against Sri Lanka at Galle in 2010–11; 317 by Chris Gayle against South Africa at St John's in 2004–05; 302 by Lawrence Rowe against England at Bridgetown in 1973–74\n14 for the cost of 149 runs by Michael Holding against England at the Oval in 1976; 13 for 55 by Courtney Walshagainst New Zealand in Wellington in 1994–95; Shanon Gabriel took 13 for 121 against Sri Lanka.:12 for 121 by Andy Roberts against India in Madras in 1974–\nWes Hall against Pakistan in 1959; Lance Gibbs against Australia in 1961; Courtney Walsh against Australia in 1988; and Jermaine Lawson against Australia in 2003\nOne-day matches.\nAn ODI hat-trick performance was made by Jerome Taylor on 19 October 2006 at Mumbai in an ICC Champions Trophy league match against Australia\nAt the ICC 2011 Cricket World Cup, Kemar Roach became the sixth bowler to claim a World Cup hat-trick against the Netherlands\nTest captains.\nThe following men have captained the West Indian cricket team in at least one Test match:\nCurrent squad.\nWest Indies released the list of their 2023–2024 national contracts on 10 December 2023. 14 players received contracts.

The WGA sponsors six golf tournaments: the Western Junior; the Western Amateur; the Women's Western Junior; the Women's Western Amateur; the NV5 Invitational presented by Old National Bank on the Korn Ferry Tour and the BMW Championship, a FedEx Cup playoff event. The WGA has also administered the Evans Scholars Program for deserving caddies since its inception in 1930 through the Evans Scholars Foundation.\nOrganization.\nMore than 460 member clubs, organizations and affiliations are part of the WGA. Par Club members and 100,000 golfers participate in the Bag Tag Program in support of the Evans Scholars Foundation, one of the nation's largest individually funded scholarship programs. The program is also supported by 25 affiliated golf associations and proceeds from the BMW Championship, one of the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoff events.\nIn addition to a staff made up of many Evans Scholars Alumni, the WGA has officers who volunteer their time to operate the organization. They are called WGA Directors.\nEvans Scholars Foundation.\nSince 1930, the Evans Scholars Foundation has awarded full tuition and housing scholarships to deserving caddies across the country. The foundation was started by Charles \"Chick\" Evans Jr. It is overseen by the WGA and aided by affiliated U.S. country clubs.\nThere are 1,130 Evans Scholars attending 24 universities in the United States. More than 12,000 caddies have graduated from college as Evans Scholars.\nTo qualify for the Evans Scholarship, students must have outstanding academic and caddie records, good character and leadership skills and financial need. The Scholarship is renewed on a yearly basis.\nThere are 17 universities with Evans Scholars Scholarship Houses, 24 partnership Universities in total. The 17 chapters are as follows in order of foundation: Northwestern University (1940), University of Illinois (1951), University of Michigan (1952), University of Wisconsin (1953), Michigan State University (1955), Marquette University (1955), University of Minnesota (1958), Ohio State University (1962), Purdue University (1967), University of Colorado (1967), University of Missouri (1968), Indiana University (1969), Miami University (1974), University of Oregon (2016), University of Kansas (2018), University of Washington (2018) and Penn State University (2019). Evans Scholars are also attending University of Chicago, Howard University, University of Illinois Chicago, University of Iowa, University of Maryland, University of Notre Dame and Rutgers University.\nEarly years.\nOriginally formed as a rulesmaking body, the WGA was born because U.S. western golf clubs (the current Midwest was \"the west\" in the 1890s) felt that they weren't being properly represented in the United States Golf Association, based then in New York. But after 20 stormy years followed by negotiations, the WGA officially recognized the USGA's authority as the rulesmaking body in the U.S.\nThe WGA oversees and hosts professional and amateur events. Today it has conducted more than 300 tournaments. Its first tournaments were held at the Glen View Club. These included the first Western Open which was held in 1899. The Western Open continued to be hosted by the association until 2006 when the name was changed to the BMW Championship for the 2007 tournament."

        "title": "Combined Islands cricket team",
        "text": "The Combined Islands cricket team was a cricket team that represented the cricket-playing islands of the Lesser Antilles, excluding Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago who fielded their own teams. They played in 13 Shell Shield tournaments from 1965–66 to 1980–81, when they won their first title and were subsequently disbanded into Leeward Islands and Windward Islands. Those two teams had first-class status before 1980–81, but competed together in the Shell Shield.\nHistory.\nThe Combined Islands played 54 first-class games, winning 11, drawing 19 and losing 24. 52 of those games were in the Shell Shield tournament, with the other two games both coming in the 1961–62 season – a Pentangular Tournament preliminary round loss to British Guiana, was followed by a home defeat to the touring Indian side that same season. From then on, the team only existed as an entity for the Shell Shield, with the British Leeward Islands and British Windward Islands fielding independent teams against touring squads, and also playing first-class matches between each other.\nInaugural Shell Shield.\nIn 1965–66, the team was among the five that played for the inaugural Shell Shield. After two draws against Jamaica and Barbados, the team went down to British Guiana, before winning the last game against Trinidad and Tobago to finish third in the table and record their first victory.\nIt took a further four seasons before the Combined Islands returned to the Shell Shield – the Leeward and Windward teams played games, but the matches they played did not count for points. The Combined team was back for the 1969–70 tournament, though, and duly lost all four games, with no player averaging more than 26 with the bat. This was the first season that the Shillingford cousins – Irvine and Grayson, who both represented West Indies at Test level – played for the Combined Islands and the two went on to play most Shell Shield matches for the Combined Islands together until 1976–77, Irving scoring more than 2,500 runs while Grayson took nearly 100 wickets for the team.\nBuilding a team.\nIn 1970–71, the Combined Islands registered their first win in five years, but still finished last behind Guyana – despite beating Guyana by 50 runs, the team lost their other three matches, and Guyana finished two points ahead. The 1971–72 season went by without a single win, although they gained a lead on first innings, but in 1972–73, the Combined Islands beat Jamaica to finish fourth after Elquemedo Willett took six for 40 in the second innings – which stood as a team record for two seasons – to help bowl Jamaica out for 132. By this time, most of the players that were to become team regulars for the remainder of its history had debuted - in addition to the Shillingford cousins, there was Vance Amory, Jim Allen, Mike Findlay, Norbert Philip, Viv Richards (who went on to play 121 Tests for the West Indies), Andy Roberts, Lockhart Sebastien and the aforementioned Willett, who all played for the Combined Islands until 1978, and four of them until the end in 1981. However, the team still failed to win more than one match a season. In 1973–74, they lost three of the four games and finished last again, despite Roberts and Philip both taking more than three wickets a match at a bowling average less than 20. That season also included their only List A game, a five-run win over the touring England side representing MCC. The Islands batted first, making 204 for 6 in 50 overs with 102 from Jim Allen and 78 from Livingstone Sargeant. Dennis Amiss made 114 for the tourists, but Grayson Shillingford (six overs for 7) and Andy Roberts (ten overs for 27) limited the scoring. Three wickets fell for 12 near the end, and the MCC finished on 199 for 6.\nTitle challengers.\nThe next season, they got their best position in the Shell Shield thus far, going unbeaten through the season and also recording their first away win – a 163-run win over Barbados, their highest win yet, which also included a second-innings century from Allen and a new record bowling analysis of six for 35 from Roberts - who finished the season with 25 wickets at a bowling average of 12.72. Allen and Richards also averaged above 50 with the bat, and after three unbeaten matches initially they set themselves up for a potential trophy win. A first innings win or an outright win in their final match at the Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad and Tobago would have seen them take the trophy, but they finished with a 30-run first innings deficit, and after being set a target of 283 to win their openers Sebastien and Michael Camacho put on 101 for the first wicket. Trinidad's bowlers came back, and after two run outs and three wickets from Imtiaz Ali and Raphick Jumadeen the Combined Islands were 276 for 9. Captain Findlay and number 11 Hugh Gore added six for the final wicket before time ran out - thus, the scores were tied at the end of the match, the match was drawn since the Islands had not lost the final wicket (in which case it would have been a tie) and the Shell Shield title went to Guyana instead of the islands.\nThe next season saw them fall back to fourth place, however, with none of the four matches seeing more than 325 overs of play in four days as the Combined Islands drew all four games – with two ending before the first innings were completed. Irvine Shillingford still managed to hit 257 runs in his three innings, averaging 85.66 with the bat. 1976–77 saw improvement in the table again, as they once again fought for the title – they were tied with Barbados on points before the very last game, but after conceding four 50+ scores –including 113 from David Murray - and a total of 511, the team surrendered a first-innings deficit of 276 despite 124 from Richards, and though Allen made 101 in the second innings and Philip took three for 15 to boost his seasonal wicket-tally to 20, Barbados made it to the target of 53 with six wickets to spare. Thus the Islands finished second in the table, tied with Trinidad and Tobago.\nThe Combined Islands finished second for the third time in four seasons in 1977-78, but this time they were in last place before the final round, when they beat Trinidad and Tobago by seven wickets to avoid the last place and propel themselves up the table to a shared second place with Jamaica. All-rounder Norbert Philip took more than 20 wickets for the second year running, and also hit 240 runs, while off spinner Derick Parry took a team record seven for 100 in the first innings of a drawn game against champions Barbados. The following season, the Combined Islands were once again on the heels of Barbados, trailing by two points before the final game in Trinidad. Despite a 109-run lead after four half-centuries and six for 90 from Parry, Combined Islands were bowled out for 181 in the second innings, and David Murray put on 27 with Inshan Ali to give Trinidad and Tobago the win and the second place in the table.\nThe next season saw the Combined Islands return to the runners-up spot, after winning two games in a season for the first time, and before the final game in Barbados they trailed their hosts by 11 points after a drawn game in Trinidad two weeks earlier. After being put in the field by the Barbados captain, Combined Islands batted to a total of 257, before centuries from Emmerson Trotman and Thelston Payne helped Barbados to a total of 555 - with Viv Richards getting the best bowling returns for the Islands with two for 71. However, he only made 3 with the bat, as his team were bowled out for 279 - losing by an innings and 19 runs, and finishing second again. Earlier on in the season, Parry had beaten his own best-innings bowling record, with nine for 76 against Jamaica, in a match where he took 15 for 101 - a record for all West Indies domestic teams which stood for 16 years. Parry finished the season with 25 wickets.\nShell Shield victory, and dissolution.\nFinally, after four runner-up spots in the preceding six seasons, it was the Combined Islands' turn to win the Shell Shield trophy in 1980-81. After starting with a draw in Trinidad, the Combined Islands won both home games - first an innings win over Jamaica, in which Andy Roberts took 11 for 101 and completed a hat-trick, and then a 165-run win over Guyana which sealed the trophy with one game to play - against Barbados, who were 35 points behind. Despite going down by an innings and 16 runs, the Combined Islands finished 12 points ahead of Barbados - who had been docked nine of those points due to a slow over rate. The Test stars Richards and Roberts topped the batting and bowling tables respectively - Richards making 323 runs despite being dismissed for 13 and 4 by Barbados, while Roberts took 24 wickets in the three games not against Barbados - and one for 48 against the Bajans.\nThe innings defeat was the end of the Combined Islands team. The West Indies Cricket Board made the decision to split the team into Windward and Leeward Islands, and the first match of the 1981-82 Shell Shield was played between these two teams - the Leeward Islands, whose team included 10 players who had played for the Combined team the previous season, won by 57 runs, and has continued to be the more successful of the two sides with three first-class titles. The Windwards are yet to win a single one.\nGrounds.\nOut of 30 first-class home games, the most were played in Warner Park on Saint Kitts, which hosted seven games. The team played cricket on a total of eight different islands, with Antigua getting six, Saint Lucia five, Grenada four, Dominica and Saint Vincent three, while Montserrat and Nevis hosted one game each."

        "text": "John Edward Drew (September 30, 1954 – April 10, 2022) was an American professional basketball player. A small forward from Gardner–Webb University, he played eleven seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Drew was a two-time NBA All-Star, and was the first player banned under the substance abuse policy instituted by league commissioner David Stern.\nEarly life.\nDrew was born in Vredenburgh, Alabama, on September 30, 1954. He attended J.F. Shields High School in Beatrice, Alabama. He led the school to a state championship in 1972. He set the Alabama High School Athletic Association career scoring average record with 41.0 points per game.\nCollege career.\nAfter graduating from high school, Drew played basketball at Gardner–Webb University. He averaged 24.4 points during his freshman year, before improving to 25.9 points and 13 rebounds as a sophomore. He was selected in the second round of the 1974 NBA draft by the Atlanta Hawks. He would later be joined by Artis Gilmore and Eddie Lee Wilkins as the only alumni of Gardner–Webb University to play in the NBA.\nProfessional career.\nAtlanta Hawks (1974–1982).\nDrew made his NBA debut on October 18, 1974, scoring 32 points to go along with 12 rebounds and three assists against the Chicago Bulls. He quickly made an impact with the Hawks, averaging 18.5 points per game, 10.7 rebounds per game, and leading the NBA in offensive rebounding (357) during his rookie season. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie Team. From 1974 to 1982, Drew starred for the Hawks, with whom he was a two-time All-Star (1976 and 1980), averaging more than 20 points per game on five occasions (1976–79 and 1981). He averaged 21.6 points in his second season, when he was named an all-star for the first time. The next season in 1976–77, he averaged almost 25 point per game. In 1976 and 1977, he ranked in the top 10 in points and points per game in the NBA.\nWith Jason Kidd, Drew holds the NBA record for most turnovers in a regular season game (14). Drew set that mark with the Hawks in a March 1, 1978 game against New Jersey. However, he recorded 12.4 turnover percentage in the league that season, finishing eighteenth in the NBA. He then bettered that mark to 11.2 the following year, the twelfth-lowest in the league.\nUtah Jazz (1982–1984).\nDrew was traded along with Freeman Williams and cash to the Utah Jazz on September 2, 1982, in exchange for Dominique Wilkins. Drew went on to play three seasons (1982–1985) with the franchise. He won the Player of the Week award on March 6, 1983. He was waived in the middle of the 1984–85 season after relapsing. He finished with NBA career with 15,291 points and averages of 20.7 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 1.7 assists per game.\nWyoming Wildcatters (1985–1986).\nDrew played in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) in hopes of returning to the NBA. He spent the 1985–86 season with the Wyoming Wildcatters where he was nominated to the All-CBA First Team and chosen as the CBA Newcomer of the League.\nDrug addiction.\nDrew battled cocaine addiction during his professional basketball career. He missed 38 games during the 1982–83 season as he spent eight weeks in drug rehab. He was the runner-up that season in voting for the NBA Comeback Player of the Year Award behind Paul Westphal of the New York Knicks. He relapsed during the 1984–85 season and was waived by the Jazz, then was arrested in May 1985 for passing bad checks. The third-degree felony charge was reduced in a plea bargain to a suspended jail sentence, and Drew was ordered to enter a drug rehabilitation program. The Washington Bullets expressed interest in signing him in December, but were prohibited from doing so by the league due to his past infractions.\nIn January 1986, Drew became the first player to be banned by NBA commissioner David Stern for multiple violations of the league's substance abuse policy. He was not on an NBA roster at the time, but the league considered his most recent rehab stint to be his third violation under the league's drug policy. He could not seek reinstatement until the 1987–88 season. Drew opined that the policy \"will keep guys from coming forward and admitting they still have a problem.\"\nIn late 1986, he was arrested in Atlanta twice in less than three months, first on October 2 for selling cocaine to an undercover agent and then on December 17 for cocaine possession and purchasing the drug from an undercover agent.\nLater life.\nAfter several years out of the public eye, Drew resurfaced in 2002, when he told the \"Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" that he had a grip on his addiction, without going into further details. He worked as a taxi driver in Houston during his later years.\nDrew died on April 10, 2022, in Houston. He was 67, and suffered from Stage IV bone cancer prior to his death."

        "title": "Handball (Australian rules football)",
        "text": "The Handball or handpass is a ball-passing skill in the sport of Australian rules football. As throwing the ball is not allowed in Australian football, passing to a fellow player are executed either by kicking, or by a controlled \"punch\" with one hand holding the ball while the other knocking it into flight (typically in a fashion similar to an uppercut or an underhand volleyball serve). Handballing is the primary means of disposing the ball quickly and over short distances in Australian football.\nHandball revolutionized the game in the 1980s, moving it from the classic kick-and-mark style of play (which runs the risk of the pass being contested and intercepted by opposing players) to a fast run-and-carry style that emphasizes on maintaining possession and rapid ball movements down the field, which has typified the game since. The most prolific handballers in the history of the Australian Football League: Lachie Neale, Greg Williams, Scott Pendlebury, Josh Kennedy and Adam Treloar have averaged more than 13 handballs a game.\nSkill.\nHandball is the most frequently used alternative of moving the football among players to kicking. In order to be a legal method to dispose of the ball, the player holds the ball with one hand and punches the ball away with the clenched fist of the other hand. A player typically punches with his dominant hand, thus holding the ball with the left hand and punching with the right hand is considered a right-handed handball. \nWhen a player receives a handpass from another player, play continues. This is unlike the kick, where if a player catches the ball on the full from a kick (a mark), he is entitled to take his next kick unimpeded. Failure to execute a handball correctly is deemed a \"throw\" or \"illegal disposal\" and results in a free kick to the nearest opposition player. Moving the hand that holds the ball excessively in the direction of the handpass, using an open hand instead of a clenched fist to tap the ball away, punching the ball out of mid-air after having thrown or otherwise lost it from the carrying hand, or handing the ball directly to a teammate will all attract a free kick for illegal disposal.\nHistory.\nThe rule defines it similarly to the open hand tap/handpass in Gaelic football but differentiates the hand skills from other codes of football. Unlike Gaelic football, punching the oval ball was more frequently used as it was the most effective technique to move the heavier ball larger distances.\nAlthough the rules allowed for the handball, for most Australian football leagues the handball was largely a secondary skill to the kick and used as a last resort when a player had no time to kick. Strategically, Australian football was viewed as a territorial sport, where the prime aim was not so much possession, but to cover as much distance through the air as possible. As the holding hand could not move, this was best achieved by means of kicking the ball as far as possible.\nThe principally used handpass was top-spin in nature. This was used with the belief that the ball could be contained more locally and executed more quickly off the hands when the ball was held in preparation for kicking, as smaller handpasses were originally used mainly when in trouble. The other thought was that, as in tennis, a top-spun ball was more easily directed, dipped faster and possessed more stability in the air.\nOne notable variant of the handpass which began to develop was known as the \"flick pass\", in which a player used his open hand instead of his fist to propel the ball. The legality of the flick pass has varied throughout the history of the game: it began to gain prominence in the early 1920s, before the Australian National Football Council (ANFC) voted to abolish it before the 1925 season, making the handpass with a clenched fist (sometimes termed a \"punch pass\" to distinguish it from the flick pass) the only legal form of handpass. This was not widely popular, as the style of punch pass used at the time a much more cumbersome disposal than a flick pass, and it resulted in the game being played at a slower pace. The flick pass was re-instated before the 1934 season. In the late 1950s and early 1960s it re-emerged as a common technique to achieve centre square clearances from scrimmages, particularly at VFL club . Of the 88 handballs executed during the 1961 VFL Grand Final, 18 were flick passes. The flick pass was abolished permanently in 1966.\nThe flick pass had the significant drawback that its action was close to that of a throw, and different umpires had different interpretations of what was legal. In 1938, motivated by a desire to eliminate this inconsistency, and to speed up the game further, the Victorian Football Association (VFA) legalised throwing the ball, provided the throw was with two hands and both hands were below shoulder-height. The throw-pass was legal in the VFA and in some other competitions affiliated with it from 1938 until 1949, but it was never legal under ANFC rules.\nThe emergence of the handball as a more widely used skill for attacking took place in the 1960s and 1970s. Legendary coach Ron Barassi, Jr. credits Len Smith (coach at between 1958 and 1962) as being the first coach to encourage attacking use of handball in Victoria. A running handball game emerged in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) with Sturt coach Jack Oatey credited with encouraging the skill through the late 1960s, leading to Sturt winning five premierships from 1966 to 1970. In Western Australia, Graham 'Polly' Farmer and Barry Cable brought a new dimension to the game using handball, with Farmer often looking for a runner to handpass to after each mark, to speed up the ball movement. The 1970 VFL Grand Final became particularly notable for its use of handball, as Carlton's extensive attacking use of handball at coach Barassi's direct and famous half time instructions helped it recover from a 44-point half-time deficit to win the game; the game is sometimes apocryphally referred to as the \"birth of modern football\" in recognition of the significant effect that a modern handballing game had on its result, although the style of play was already common before the game.\nThe modern handpass technique, known as the rocket handball, was pioneered by Kevin Sheedy. It is executed so that the ball rotates backwards in an end-to-end fashion, similar to the drop punt. The ball is held on a slight angle with the fist ending up in or close to the other open hand. This enables a handpass to achieve distance and speed comparable to a short kick and is easier for teammates to catch. Professional Australian footballers are typically competent at handballing using either punching arm. Other handball variations include the underground handball, which is similar to a bounce pass in basketball or netball, and the dubious hospital handball (so called because of its potential for putting the intended recipient in hospital due to opponents closing in on the target player, usually caused by a high pass to a closely guarded player).\nWith the wide adoption of the handball in the 1980s, midfielders such as Greg Williams and Dale Weightman became handball specialists, renowned their playmaking ability by preferring to handball in the midfield. In the 1980s, Richmond Football Club wingman Kevin Bartlett became famous for a style of play which involved use of the handball to dispose of the ball before an opponent was about to tackle.\nAlthough rules were uniform across the country, local interpretations and customs varied. South Australian players became known for a very localised style of play in which players excelled in quickly releasing the ball. The style, known pejoratively interstate as a \"crow throw\" (derived from \"croweaters\", a popular term for South Australians), became damaging to opposition sides in interstate matches, as well as a potent weapon for the Adelaide Crows when the club first entered the Australian Football League in the 1991 AFL season. The legality of the technique was frequently brought into question in the AFL. The South Australian style featured a significantly shorter swinging distance between the punching hand and holding hand, allowing it to be executed in almost any stance. This also made it more difficult for a tackler to attack the swinging arm. As had been a problem with the flick pass, it was more difficult for spectators and umpires to interpret whether or not the correct punching method is being used. Andrew Jarman was the most notable exponent, although it resulted in many free kicks against him when playing outside the SANFL.\nSince 2000, the number of handpasses used in AFL matches has grown substantially, double that of the 1970s. The focus of the modern game was to use chains of handballs to break through defensive zones, and to avoid kicking to contests.\nHandball competitions.\nHandball competitions are often used to test the accuracy of handpasses. A handball competition typically uses a board or vertically hung material with a target consisting of multiple coloured concentric bands worth different points. The centre is usually cut out to let the ball through and is worth maximum points (typically ten).\nHandball competitions often occur at local clubs, Auskick clinics and on television, most notably on the shows \"World of Sport\" and \"The Sunday Footy Show\" (both hosted by Lou Richards). Such competitions take place between Australian Football League players known for their handpassing skills, and often utilise moving targets."

        "title": "Still Climbing (Cinderella album)",
        "text": "Still Climbing is the fourth and final studio album by the American rock band Cinderella, released on November 8, 1994, by Mercury Records. The release of \"Still Climbing\" was delayed due to lead vocalist Tom Keifer losing his voice in 1991.\nThe album peaked at No. 178 on the \"Billboard\" 200.\nBackground.\nCinderella first performed \"Talk Is Cheap\" and \"Freewheelin\" during a show at the Empire Rock Club in Philadelphia in 1985. The version of \"Talk Is Cheap\" that the band performed in the 1980s is shorter in duration and performed at a faster tempo than the final version the band recorded for \"Still Climbing\". Around 1985, prior to recording their first album \"Night Songs\", the band also recorded a demo of \"Talk Is Cheap.\"\n\"Hot &amp; Bothered\" had first appeared on \"\" in 1992\".\"\nStylistically, \"Still Climbing\" maintained the stripped-down, bluesy sound the band had begun exploring in their prior album \"Heartbreak Station\". Bassist Eric Brittingham stated that he found it \"refreshing\" when people acknowledged the band's continued shift from glam metal to blues-based rock.\nSongwriting and production.\nWhile the band was writing for and recording the album, Tom Keifer experienced vocal cord paresis, which he cited as an obstacle for his songwriting. The surgery and resultant recovery time forced the band into a two-year hiatus, which Brittingham cited as the reason it took the band so long to release the follow-up to \"Heartbreak Station\". Keifer stated in a 2013 interview, \"I am writing for the record, and I don't know what voice I am writing for because I don't know if I am going to have a voice.\" Keifer also stated, \"I really didn't ever get to the point where my voice was fully retrained, back and functioning properly, even while we were recording that record.\"\nKeifer explained that \"Still Climbing\" was difficult to record due to the band having to balance Keifer's vocal difficulties with pressure from their label to release new music. During the recording process, Keifer had to adopt a different recording technique and vocal technique from what he had grown accustomed to with the band's first three records: \"The first three records, I would go in and sing it down on a few tracks, and Andy [Johns, the band's producer] and I would comp from a couple of tracks. Pretty standard procedure. Just sing the song from top to bottom a few times, then go in and edit from the best stuff. On \"Still Climbing,\" I was going in and singing one line over and over and over, and trying to get my pipes to work right and get the sounds that I wanted. It was just a weird record to make. It was not an easy record to make, but a lot of the songs, I really like. And you know, it is what it is.\"\nCritical reception.\n\"The Encyclopedia of Popular Music\" called \"Still Climbing\" \"a strong comeback.\" AllMusic deemed it \"a gritty record that shows them building upon the bluesy hard rock of \"Heartbreak Station\".\"\n\"The Morning Call\" described the songs as \"glossy blues- and pop-oriented heavy metal.\"\n\"The Hamilton Spectator\" wrote: \"While the music's hot, the messages are not. Keifer has simply run out of things to say aside from the coming-of-youth wisdom of 'The Road's Still Long'.\"\n\"The Indianapolis Star\" wrote that the songs \"are 90 percent chorus ('Hot &amp; Bothered' and 'Freewheelin') - and not even particularly creative ones at that; they're just repetitive phrases that might manage to come off well with a concert crowd.\"\nCommercial performance and promotion.\n\"Still Climbing\" peaked at No. 178 on the \"Billboard 200\".\nIn a February 1995 interview for \"Deseret News\", the band's bassist, Eric Brittingham, said that one of the obstacles the band encountered while attempting to promote \"Still Climbing\" was the rock industry's shift away from glam metal bands; Brittingham recalled that while the band made plans to release music videos on MTV, MTV contacted the band's marketing director and informed them that \"they've stopped playing our style of music.\"\nIn 2011, Brittingham stated in an interview that the low sales numbers of the record led to the band being dropped by their label, after which they temporarily disbanded.\nTrack listing.\nAll songs are written by Tom Keifer, except \"The Road's Still Long\" by Keifer and Andy Johns, and \"Hot &amp; Bothered\" by Keifer and Eric Brittingham."

        "title": "John Williamson (basketball, born 1951)",
        "text": "John Lee Williamson ( – November 30, 1996) was an American basketball player. He helped the New York Nets win two league championships in the American Basketball Association (ABA) in the 1970s.\nWilliamson played high school basketball at Wilbur Cross High School in New Haven, Connecticut and played college basketball at New Mexico State University. He was a 6'2\" guard. He was nicknamed \"Super John\" for his highly efficient jump shooting.\nHigh school career.\nWhile at Wilbur Cross High School, Williamson played on the Connecticut state champion teams of 1966–67 and 1967–68. In the 1968 title game, Cross won over Bridgeport Central, 123–82. Williamson's teammates, Alex Scott (24 points), and Clint Davis (40 points) led the way in the romp for Cross's third consecutive title. Williamson contributed 17 points, which was his average that year.\nIn 1969, Cross was runner up to crosstown rival Hillhouse in 1968–69, losing 76–71 in the final. For Williamson's senior (1969–70) year, he led the nation in scoring, averaging 38.7 points per game. His team was upset in a semi-final match, once again playing Bridgeport Central, with an ending score of 105–103.\nCollege career.\nWilliamson went on to team up with Scott and Davis at New Mexico State University where he averaged 27 points per game within 2 years.\nProfessional career.\nAs a rookie, Williamson landed a roster spot with the New York Nets of the ABA as a free agent for the 1973–74 season. Before signing with the ABA Nets, he had been eligible for the NBA draft that year, being selected by the Atlanta Hawks in the 6th round with the 96th pick, but didn't make the cut for their roster. Despite being a rookie, Williamson quickly entered the New York starting lineup along with superstar Julius Erving and rising star rookie Larry Kenon (who would get traded a couple of years later). After Williamson became a starter, the team's fortunes quickly turned for the better and the team ended up winning the ABA Championship that season. Williamson was named to the 1974 ABA All-Rookie team.\nContinuing with the Nets, Williamson, in Game 6 of the 1976 ABA Finals, scored 28 points with 16 of them coming in the fourth quarter. He and Erving carried the team's offense, combining for 59 points (31 of them from Erving) and leading the Nets to come back from 22 points behind to win the game, the series and the ABA championship.\nIn the 1976–77 season, Williamson was traded to the Indiana Pacers midseason; in the middle of the next season, he was traded back to the Nets. The Nets would make the playoffs in 1978–79 with Williamson scoring a then-record 38 points for an NBA playoff debut. The Nets would however lose 0–2 in the series to the Philadelphia 76ers. In the 1979–80 season he was traded from the Nets to the Washington Bullets who would be the last team he played for before the end of his NBA career until the 1980–81 season. By this time Williamson had largely declined as a player despite being only 29 years old and wouldn't return to the NBA after that season due to contract disagreements in free agency and not maintaining a healthy weight to play.\nIn 1982, he would play for the CBA Las Vegas Silvers in an attempt to get recruited back into the NBA but never received any offers.\nIn his ABA/NBA career, Williamson scored 9,017 points. He averaged between 11.5 and 29.5 points in every ABA/NBA season except for his last.\nWilliamson still holds Nets team records in various categories, including most free throw attempts in a game, with 24 (since tied by Vince Carter and Devin Harris).\nWilliamson's jersey number (23) was retired by the New York/New Jersey Nets franchise on December 7, 1990; Williamson is one of three players who were with the Nets during their ABA days with a retired number; the other two are Bill Melchionni and Julius Erving.\nPersonal life.\nAfter professional basketball, Williamson would end up working in a juvenile detention center back in his hometown of New Haven, Connecticut.\nAt age 45, Williamson died of kidney failure related to diabetes on November 30, 1996. He was survived by his wife Bertha Williamson and his four children."

        "text": "On 26 June 1954, in a quarterfinal match of the 1954 FIFA World Cup, Austria beat Switzerland 7–5 in Lausanne, Switzerland. The 12 goals scored in the match set a World Cup record, unequalled to date, for the highest scoring match ever. The match is known by its German name, Hitzeschlacht von Lausanne (roughly translated to \"The heat battle of Lausanne\"), due to the high temperature that it was played under, 40 °C (104 °F).\nMatch chronicle.\nSwitzerland, the tournament hosts, took a notable lead early on. In four minutes, the Swiss scored three goals: forward Robert Ballaman opened the score at the 16th minute, followed quickly by two goals by Josef Hügi. Austria then became the first team in World Cup history to recover from a 3–0 deficit, scoring 5 goals in the remainder of the first half; Theodor Wagner initiated the Austrian response at the 25th minute; forward Alfred Körner drew the score to 2–3 one minute later, and another minute later Wagner equalized to 3–3. Austria had tied the score in three minutes. In 11 minutes, between the 16th and the 27th minutes, six goals were scored, three by each team. At the 32nd minute, Ernst Ocwirk gave Austria the lead; Körner added his second, making the score 5–3. Ballaman scored again for Switzerland at the 39th minute. The first half thus ended 5–4 in favour of Austria, being the highest scoring half in World Cup history, even after inside left Körner had missed a penalty kick in the 42nd minute.\nNine minutes into the second half, Wagner put Austria up 6–4 with his third goal, recording the seventh hat-trick of the 1954 World Cup (\"See List of World Cup hat-tricks\"). Hügi would then emulate the feat, scoring his third at the 58th minute. Switzerland was not able to equalize, and Erich Probst made it 7–5 to end the scoring at the 76th minute. According to FIFA, the extreme heat adversely affected Switzerland after they led the match 3–0 at one point. Other sources add that at first, Switzerland had been able to take advantage of the temperature, when Austrian goalkeeper Kurt Schmied suffered from hyperthermia early in the match, quickly allowing the first three Swiss goals, before being assisted by the Austrian masseur while in play."

        "title": "Soft tennis",
        "text": "Soft tennis is a racket game played on a court of two halves, separated by a net. Soft tennis originated in Japan in 1884. Like regular tennis, it is played by individuals (singles) or pairs (doubles), whose objective is to hit the ball over the net, landing within the confines of the court, with the aim of preventing one's opponent from being able to hit it back. Matches are generally best-of-seven or best-of-nine. Soft tennis differs from regular tennis in that it uses soft rubber balls instead of hard yellow balls.\nIt is played primarily in Asia, especially in Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, India, Thailand, and the Philippines. In 2004, soft tennis was introduced into Europe. Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom all now have active soft tennis federations. All of them are also members of the European Soft Tennis Federation, and the International Federation JSTA.\nHistory.\nSoft tennis originated in Japan in 1884. At the end of the 19th century, tennis was introduced to Japan by a Western missionary, and it was later modified to better suit Japanese tastes. A special racquet and ball were developed, and the game became known as . Soft tennis was included in the 1990 Asian Games as an exhibition game and later became an official event in the 1994 Asian Games, It continues to be an official event at the Asian Games.\nCurrent situation in Japan.\nIn the 1970s, it was said that \"soft tennis is the most popular sport in middle and high school\" [6]. Currently, there is a competitive population (registrants) of about 600,000 in Japan. The Japan Soft Tennis Federation estimates that there are about 7 million enthusiasts [7]. However, it is also a fact that the minor feeling is extremely strong in the consciousness of lovers in general. The causes are that it is not an Olympic event, that there have been no professional athletes in Japan for a long time [Note 38] [8], and that it is recognized that school physical education (junior high school, high school) is the main focus [Note 39]. ], The influence of tennis (rigid tennis, lawn tennis) [Note 40], which has rapidly become popular in Japan since the 1980s, is considered.\nInternational Soft Tennis Federation.\nThe International Soft Tennis Federation (ISTF) was established in 1973 and is the premier soft tennis governing body.\nIn 1970 the Japan-US Soft Tennis Promotion Liaison Council was established. This is a liaison organization with American schools, and organised a friendly match between Japan and the United States for junior high school students.\nIn 1972, the Hawaii Soft Tennis Federation was established in Hawaii, United States. A state championship was held at the same time. Soft tennis was adopted as a regular PE event at a public high school in Hawaii.\nBefore and after the establishment of the Hawaii Soft Tennis Association, the Hong Kong Soft Tennis Association was established with the efforts of Taiwan (Republic of China Network Association). The Soft Tennis Association was also established in Venezuela and Brazil.\nIn June 1974 the first Japan-US High School Friendship Tournament was held.\nMembers.\nAs of 2022 the ISTF had 60 members:\nCompetition.\nMost of the rules for soft tennis are the same as those for regular tennis. When the rules were revised in 1992, singles became a formal event. This revision also enabled a forward player in doubles to serve. The serve plays an important role in a team's chances of winning.\nThe world championship was held every two years until 1987. Thereafter, the competition is held every four years. The following is a list of World Soft Tennis Championships and World Junior Soft Tennis Championships held by the International Soft Tennis Federation."

        "title": "1965 Indianapolis 500",
        "text": "The 49th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Monday, May 31, 1965.\nThe five-year-old \"British Invasion\" finally broke through as Jim Clark and Colin Chapman triumphed in dominating fashion with the first rear-engined Indy-winning car, a Lotus 38 powered by Ford. With only six of the 33 cars in the field having front engines, it was the first 500 in history to have a majority of cars as rear-engined machines.\nClark, of Scotland, started from the front row, and led 190 laps, the most since Bill Vukovich (195) in 1953. He became the first non-American winner of the Indianapolis 500 since 1920 when Frenchman Gaston Chevrolet won. Clark would go on to win the 1965 World Championship (which Indianapolis was not part of any longer). He is the only driver in history to win the Indy 500 and Formula One World Championship in the same year. Clark actually chose to skip Monaco to compete at Indy.\nABC Sports covered the race for the first time on \"Wide World of Sports\". Charlie Brockman anchored the broadcast along with Rodger Ward.\nRule changes.\nFollowing the tragic 1964 race, this race was run relatively clean with no major accidents. Contrary to some popular belief, gasoline was not banned for the 1965 race. Instead, USAC officials crafted several calculated rule changes to effectively encourage teams to use methanol in order to be competitive. In addition, a new minimum car weight of 1,250 pounds was also established.\nFor 1965, all cars were required to make a minimum of two pit stops. A pit stop was generally defined as coming to a complete stop in the respective pit box, and hooking up the fueling mechanism. Tire changes were not specifically required, and some cars in fact changed zero tires all day. On-board fuel tank capacity was reduced to 75 gallons, which also included requirements that they contain rubber bladders inside, and were required to be behind the driver on the left side of each car. Crossover tubes were no longer allowed ahead of the driver as well. Pressurized fueling rigs were also outlawed. All fueling rigs from 1965 onward had to be gravity fed, a rule that still is in effect as of 2023.\nConventional \"pump\" gasoline registered better fuel mileage than methanol, and could go a longer distance before needing to refuel. The methanol-powered engines had worse fuel mileage, but were expected to produce more horsepower and effectively race faster. Since cars were required to make a minimum of two fuel stops, the advantage to using gasoline (i.e., fewer pit stops and better resulting track position) was diminished, or outright lost.\nWhile most teams switched to methanol, the Agajanian team decided to utilize a methanol/gasoline blend. Chief mechanic Johnny Pulson and driver Parnelli Jones determined that they were effectively down on power, finished second, and attributed the fuel blend as what cost them a chance to win the race.\nTime trials.\nOne other major change was implemented for time trials. The evening before pole day time trials, a new blind draw was to be used to establish the qualifying order (namely for Pole Day). Prior to 1965, no draw was used, and the qualifying order was a \"first-come, first-served\" line-up, queued down the pit lane and usually stretching into the garage area. Some teams would even claim their spots in line the night before. The unorganized scramble to roll the cars into a queue had often led to heated exchanges, collisions, and unfair situations.\nEach entry would still be allowed up to three attempts to qualify (across all four scheduled days). Once the original qualifying draw order had been exhausted on Pole Day, if there was still time left in the day (prior to the traditional 6 o'clock gun), the track was open for qualifying on a first-come, first-served basis. A proposal to charge cars with an attempt if they got to the front of the line but elected not to go out, or went out and did not take the green flag to start the run, was rejected. Despite the addition of a qualifying draw, each car in the order was not yet guaranteed the opportunity to make an attempt during the pole round. If rain were to delay or interrupt the qualifying line on Pole Day, any cars left in the original qualifying order at the time the track closed (due to rain or at the 6 o'clock gun) were simply out of luck, and had to qualify on the next round. This technicality would be corrected in 1971.\nBackground.\nAfter suffering a terrible crash in January at the Motor Trend 500 at Riverside, A. J. Foyt was back behind the wheel in time for the 500. Foyt had suffered a broken back, crushed sternum, and a concussion after he lost his brakes, hit an embankment, and flipped violently in a stock car.\nThere would be considerable turnaround in the starting lineup, with eleven rookies making the race, the most since 1951 (12). The rookie class of 1965 was historically notable, including such drivers as Mario Andretti, Al Unser Sr., Gordon Johncock, Joe Leonard, and George Snider.\nPractice.\nThe track opened for practice on Saturday May 1. On Monday May 3, Jim Clark turned a lap of 150.779 mph, the first driver over 150 mph for the month. On Tuesday May 4, chief steward Harlan Fengler lifted the speed limits, and A. J. Foyt upped his practice speed to 155 mph.\nOn Wednesday May 5, A. J. Foyt's Lotus-Ford wrecked on the backstretch when a magnesium hub carrier snapped. The next day, all of the Lotus-Fords and Lola cars were parked by USAC for a few days until tests and improvements could be made to the magnesium parts. Thursday's practice was cut short due to rain.\nOn Monday May 10, after adequate improvements, the Lotus-Fords were authorized to return to the track. Both Foyt and Clark turned laps over 158 mph. Foyt and Clark continued to top the speed charts during the week, and on Thursday, Foyt blistered the track with a new unofficial track record of 161.146 mph.\nOn the day before pole day, Ebb Rose spun in turn one in front of Bobby Unser, collecting him in the crash. Unser was driving the brand new four-wheel drive Novi car entered by Andy Granatelli. Unser's car t-boned Rose's car, and spun wildly into the outside wall. Rose was not hurt. Unser was sent to the hospital for x-rays, but was not seriously injured.\nTime trials.\nPole Day – Saturday May 15.\nPole day was a record-setting day, as drivers officially broke the 160 mph barrier. Rookie Mario Andretti was one of the first drivers to set the pace, putting in a lap of 159.406 mph, and a four-lap average of 158.849 mph. Later, Jim Clark in the Lotus 38, became the first driver to break the 160 mph barrier. His first two laps of 160.772 mph and 160.973 mph set one-lap records. His record four-lap average of 160.729 mph tentatively put him on the pole.\nDefending race winner A. J. Foyt ended up as the fastest of the day, with three laps in the 161 mph range. His first lap of 161.958 mph established the new one-lap track record. His record four-lap average of 161.233 secured the pole position, his first pole at Indy.\nA day after his crash during practice, Bobby Unser got in a year-old Novi back up car to qualify 8th. Nineteen cars qualified on pole day.\nSecond day – Sunday May 16.\nStrong winds kept most cars off the track. Only two drivers (Don Branson and Arnie Knepper) qualified. At the end of the first weekend of time trials, the field was filled to 21 cars.\nThird day – Saturday May 22.\nJim Hurtubise, who was seriously burned in a crash at Milwaukee in 1964, completed his comeback by qualifying a Novi at , the fastest of eleven qualifiers that day.\nTwo drivers crashed during the day, Rodger Ward and Lloyd Ruby. Ruby wrecked his already-qualified machine, but Ward was still struggling to get up to speed. Masten Gregory and Al Unser both blew engines, but were able to keep the cars off the wall.\nBobby Johns, a NASCAR regular, skipped the World 600 and entered as a teammate to Jim Clark in another Lotus. He qualified for 22nd position, third fastest of the afternoon.\nAt the end of the day, there was only one spot left open in the field.\nBump day – Sunday May 23.\nFormer winner Rodger Ward failed to qualify. He suffered a crash and three blown engines during the month. He got onto the track in the final 15 minutes, but his qualifying attempt was too slow to make the field.\nBob Mathouser was the final driver in Indy history to attempt to qualify in a front-wheel drive machine, but the engine blew and he did not make the field.\nRace recap.\nThe Wood Brothers from the NASCAR Grand National circuit, were invited by Ford Motor Company to work the pit stops for Team Lotus (drivers Jim Clark and Bobby Johns). Their arrival at the Speedway was quickly recognized and much reported. They were well known for their rapid pit stop work in NASCAR, and their presence immediately created a stir in the garage area. It took them only a short time to acclimatize to the open wheel championship cars' equipment.\nTheir contributions to the victory, however, have been considered overstated in some cases. Historians agree that Clark's Lotus-Ford was capable of winning the race handily without the added help of the Wood Brothers. In fact, the only work done on the cars was routine refueling, as they did not need to change tires during the race. Clark made only two stops all day, and the quickness of the refueling process was largely attributed to a specially-designed gravity fueling rig with a venturi tube. One of the things they did ahead of time was to \"break in\" the new fueling hose nozzles by simply working them in and out of the coupling for a period of time.\nFirst half.\nA. J. Foyt started on the pole, but Jim Clark led the first lap. Jim Hurtubise dropped out with a broken transmission on the first lap. Foyt took the lead on lap two, and at first glance, the early laps appeared as if they were going to develop into a duel. However, Clark re-took the lead on lap 3, and pulled away.\nHeavy attrition saw 17 cars drop out with engine or mechanical trouble before reaching the halfway point.\nLloyd Ruby spun, but was able to continue. He went to the pits for new tires, but the heavily flat-spotted tires required a minute and a half to change.\nClark led until lap 65, giving up the lead for a pit stop. A. J. Foyt led from lap 66-74. On lap 75, Clark regained the lead of the race.\nSecond half.\nJim Clark still led at the halfway point, and would not relinquish the lead for the remainder of the race. Early contender A. J. Foyt dropped out after 115 laps with a broken gearbox.\nThe lone accident of the day involved Bud Tingelstad, who lost a wheel and spun into the outside wall in turn three.\nScotland's Jim Clark became the first non-American winner of the Indianapolis 500 since 1920. Clark led three times for a total of 190 laps. Only eleven cars were running at the finish. Second place Parnelli Jones ran out of fuel on the final lap, and pushed his car back to the pits.\nRookie Mario Andretti, who ran no lower than 6th all afternoon, came home third, and won the Rookie of the Year award. Despite rapidly becoming obsolete, two front-engined roadsters still finished in the top ten. Rookie Gordon Johncock finished 5th, and Eddie Johnson came home 10th. Johncock was locked in a duel with Al Miller in the late stages of the race.\nThe race was slowed by only three yellow lights for a total of 13 minutes.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nBroadcasting.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Sid Collins served as chief announcer for the 14th year, and 18th year overall with the crew. Fred Agabashian served as \"driver expert,\" and Rodger Ward (who failed to qualify), joined the pre-race coverage briefly to offer commentary. The four and a half hour broadcast opened with a 30-minute pre-race segment.\nThe broadcast was carried by over 800 affiliates and was heard by an estimated 100 million listeners worldwide. The broadcast was carried by Armed Forces Network, as well as Radio New York Worldwide. Foreign translation rebroadcasts in Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Italian were heard in Central and South America and elsewhere.\nAfter visiting the broadcast booth in 1964 for an interview, Donald Davidson returned, joining the crew full-time as race historian. Also new for 1965 was Ron Carrell, who reported from the backstretch. Other guests that visited the booth included Gus Grissom, Senator Birch Bayh, Assistant Postmaster General Tyler Able, Wally Parks, Peter DePaolo, J. C. Agajanian, 500 Festival Chairperson Margaret Clark and 500 Festival Queen Suzanne Devine Sams.\nAbsent from the crew was nine-year veteran Jack Shapiro, who died the previous summer at the age of 37.\nTelevision.\nThe race was shown live on MCA closed-circuit television in approximately 180 theaters and venues across the United States. Charlie Brockman served as anchor.\nThe following weekend on June 5, the race was carried in the United States on ABC's \"Wide World of Sports\". It was ABC's first exclusive network coverage of the Indianapolis 500 on race day. Charlie Brockman anchored the telecast, as he did during the closed-circuit broadcast. The \"Wide World of Sports\" broadcast was an edited tape of the closed-circuit broadcast, and driver Rodger Ward served as analyst. Ward sat out the 1965 race, having failed to qualify, but returned in 1966."

It won the bronze medal in both the 1952 and 1956 Summer Olympics. Uruguay is currently ranked 40th in the FIBA World Rankings.\nCompetitive record.\nFIBA South American Championship.\nUruguay was the host and champion of the first major continental basketball championship, the South American Basketball Championship 1930. The event was held in Montevideo and featured four South American national basketball teams. Teams played each of the other three teams twice each; Uruguay won all six of its games. In 1932, Uruguay lost its first game of the South American Basketball Championship series when it was defeated by Chile in one of the two matches it played against the Chileans in the preliminary round. When each team finished at 3–1 (each having defeated Argentina twice), the two countries played a third match to determine the champion, which Uruguay won.\nThe 1934 and 1935 competitions did not end so happily for the Uruguay team, as they finished in last place each year. With the larger fields of 5 teams each year in 1937, 1938, and 1939, Uruguay fared somewhat better. They took second place in 1937 and 1939, and third in 1938.\nUruguay won their third championship in 1940, which saw the return of the series to Montevideo. There were a record six teams in competition that year; Uruguay beat each of the other five in turn to finish undefeated. 1941 resulted in a bronze medal for Uruguay.

        "text": "Henry Willis Patrick \"Bill\" Norman (July 16, 1910 – April 21, 1962) was an American outfielder, coach, manager and scout in Major League Baseball. A longtime minor league player and manager, he is best remembered for his brief term as pilot of the Detroit Tigers in 1958–59.\nPlaying career.\nNorman was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and served as a bat boy for the St. Louis Browns as a 12-year-old. He attended St. Louis University and signed his first professional baseball contract in 1929. A right-handed hitting and throwing outfielder who stood tall and weighed , he rose quickly to the Major League level as player. \nAt 21 years old, he was called up to the Chicago White Sox in 1931 after hitting .366 in the Class C Western Association. But he got into only 37 games with the 1931–32 White Sox, batted only .204 in 103 at bats, and would spend the rest of his playing career in the minors, where he batted .303 with 292 home runs in 2,092 games. Norman led the Class A1 Texas League in runs batted in (1941), and the top-level American Association in home runs (1942).\nManaging career.\nIn June 1946, he became manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Triple-A International League, then spent five seasons as a manager in the Cleveland Indians' farm system, winning consecutive Eastern League pennants with the Wilkes-Barre Barons in 1950–51.\nNorman then served as a coach for his hometown Browns for in 1952–53 — the Browns' last seasons in St. Louis before moving to Baltimore. In 1954, he joined the Tigers' organization as a scout and minor league manager, and rose to the Triple-A level as skipper of the Charleston Senators of the American Association in 1957. The following season, the Tigers — struggling at 21–28 under Jack Tighe on June 10 — promoted Norman to manager. He led them to 56 victories in 105 games and a fifth-place finish. But during the 1950s, the Tigers were undergoing a period of transition in their ownership and front office and in rebuilding mode on the field. They began 1959 with one of the worst starts in their history, losing 15 of their first 17 games. Norman could not survive the catastrophic streak; he was fired in favor of Jimmie Dykes on May 3. \nNorman then rejoined his first MLB team, the White Sox, as a scout. In 1961 he returned to the minor leagues when he was named manager of the Chisox' Triple-A affiliate, the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League, on July 12. It was his last year in baseball. After he returned to his job as a White Sox scout, Norman died from a heart attack at the outset of the 1962 season, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at the age of 51."

        "title": "Steve Rogers (baseball)",
        "text": "Stephen Douglas Rogers (born October 26, 1949) is an American former professional baseball starting pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Montreal Expos from 1973 to 1985. Rogers led MLB in earned run average in 1982 and was a five-time MLB All-Star. Rogers is also notable for being the only player with at least a ten-year career to spend his entire career with the Expos.\nEarly life.\nRogers was born in Jefferson City, Missouri, and raised in Springfield to Doug and Connie Rogers, the former being a dentist. He pitched for his high school team in junior year and senior year, pitching them to the state championship tournament semifinals in the latter year. Rogers was scouted by Tom Greenwade of the New York Yankees, who drafted him in the 67th round of the 1967 draft. However, Rogers' father told the scout that his son was not ready, which led to Greenwade recommending Rogers to Gene Shell, coach of the University of Tulsa. During Rogers' sophomore year, the team made it to the College World Series title game, losing 10–1 to Arizona State. Rogers was named to the all-tournament team at the 1971 College World Series. While at the University of Tulsa he was a member of the Kappa Sigma fraternity. Rogers graduated with a degree in petroleum engineering.\nMajor League career.\nThe Montreal Expos selected Rogers in the first round, with the fourth overall selection, of the 1971 MLB draft. Rogers made his debut on July 18, 1973, against the Houston Astros at the Astrodome. He threw eight innings while allowing two runs on four hits, with three walks and two strikeouts. Although Rogers received a no decision, the Expos prevailed 3–2 in the tenth inning. Eight days later, he received his first career win at Veterans Stadium, against the Philadelphia Phillies, pitching a one-hitter while striking out three and walking one in the 4–0 win. That year, Rogers went 10–5 with a 1.54 ERA in 17 games and 134 innings of work, having seven complete games, 64 strikeouts and 49 walks. He finished 2nd in the National League Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award voting that year to Gary Matthews. Alongside Matthews, he was awarded the Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award for that season.\nFor 1974, Rogers had an up-and-down year. He started the season well, winning his first three starts and going 7–2 at one point, but he subsequently lost his next six games, with his ERA rising above four by the time May was over. By the time of his last start before the All-Star Game on July 23, he was 10–11. Despite this, he was named to the All-Star Game at Three Rivers Stadium, although he did not pitch. Rogers lost six consecutive decisions midway through August. He finished 15–22 with a 4.47 ERA in 38 games and innings of work. Rogers had 11 complete games while allowing 126 earned runs (a career high), with 154 strikeouts and 80 walks. He faced over a thousand batters (with 1,064) for the first time in his career. Still, manager Gene Mauch was frustrated by Rogers's failure to repeat his success of the previous year.\nThe following year, Rogers went 11–12 with a 3.29 ERA in 35 games and innings of work. He had 12 complete games with 137 strikeouts and 88 walks. Rogers finished in the top ten of numerous categories, such as innings pitched (ninth), games started (tenth), complete games (eighth), hits (sixth), home runs per nine innings (seventh with 0.465), batters faced (sixth), and errors by a pitcher (first, with seven).\nFor 1976, Rogers was selected to start the Opening Day game for the Expos, facing the New York Mets at Shea Stadium. In six innings of work, he allowed three runs (two earned) on four hits, with six strikeouts and three walks, taking the loss as the Expos lost 3–2. For the season, he went 7–17 with a 3.21 ERA in 33 games and 230 innings of work, with one save. Rogers finished with 150 strikeouts and 69 walks. The season was a turbulent one for the Expos, as they went 55–107, the only time that Rogers was on a 100–loss team.\nAlthough he never won 20 games, Rogers averaged 14 wins per season between 1974 and 1985. He made nine Opening Day starts for the Expos, eight of them consecutively from 1976 to 1983.\nThe 1977 season brought changes for Rogers and the team. At the helm as manager for the Expos was Dick Williams, who had led the Oakland Athletics to back-to-back World Series championships earlier in the decade. However, Williams was not a fan of Rogers. In his book \"No More Mister Nice Guy\", he accused Rogers of being unwilling to step up when his team needed him in big games once the Expos became contenders. According to Williams, Rogers was at his best when the Expos were bad because he had no pressure. Williams called Rogers \"a fraud\", claiming that he had \"king of the mountain syndrome\". Rogers made his second consecutive Opening Day start on April 9, 1977, against the Philadelphia Phillies. He pitched four innings while allowing three runs on five hits, receiving a no decision as the Expos prevailed to win 4–3. Rogers went 17–16 with a 3.10 ERA in 40 games and innings of work, the latter two being career highs. He also had 17 complete games while having 206 strikeouts and 81 walks, the former two being career highs. He faced 1,235 batters, the most in his career for a season.\nThe following year, Rogers went 13–10 with a 2.47 ERA. In 30 games, he had 11 complete games with a shutout and a save in 219 innings. He had 126 strikeouts and 64 walks. He was named to the All-Star Game in San Diego. Rogers pitched the fourth and fifth inning for the National League, allowing no runs on two hits. On May 5, he gave up Pete Rose's 3,000th career hit.\nRogers had another excellent 1979 season. He went 13–12 with a 3.00 ERA in 37 games, having 13 complete games while reaching a career high five shutouts. He threw innings of work while having 143 strikeouts and 78 walks.\nThe following year, he improved to a 16–11 season with a 2.98 ERA. In 37 games, he had 14 complete games while throwing 281 innings with 147 strikeouts and 85 walks. Although he did not receive an All-Star Game nod, he finished fifth in the Cy Young Award race to Steve Carlton.\n1981 marked a change for the Expos and Rogers. A strike occurred in June that lasted until August, causing the season to be split into two halves, which meant the winners of each half for the respective division would face off against each other. Rogers went 12–8 with a 3.42 ERA in 22 games and innings of work. He had 87 strikeouts and 41 walks. The alienation by manager Williams of players such as Rogers and closer Jeff Reardon led to his firing on September 7, 27 games before the second half ended, replaced by Jim Fanning. The Expos went 16–11 down the stretch to win the second half and clinch a playoff spot. In his final five games of the season (all under management by Fanning), Rogers went 3–2 while throwing two complete games. Rogers was tasked to start the opening game of the National League Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies and ace Steve Carlton at Olympic Stadium. In the first postseason game in Canada on October 7, Rogers threw innings while allowing one run on ten hits as the Expos triumphed 3–1. He was sent to the mound for Game 5 four days later at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia to try and give Montreal a postseason series win. He threw a complete game while allowing six hits and no runs as the Expos broke through in the fifth inning. On the mound against Carlton, he lined a single into center field, scoring Larry Parrish and Chris Speier that proved to be the winning hit as the Expos won 3–0. He started Game 3 of the National League Championship Series on October 16, facing off against Jerry Reuss in Montreal. Rogers allowed one run on seven hits in a complete game as the Expos prevailed 4–1. In Game 5 on the 19th, he was sent in relief to preserve a 1–1 tie in the ninth inning in relief of Ray Burris. He retired Steve Garvey and Ron Cey before facing Rick Monday. On a 3–1 count, Monday hit a home run that gave the Dodgers the lead. The Expos could not get a run in the bottom of the inning as the Dodgers won the series and the National League pennant 2–1.\nThe decision of manager Jim Fanning to use Rogers in that game, on only two-days rest, is still debated by Montreal fans. In his four postseason games, Rogers was 3–1 with a 0.97 ERA and two complete games.\nThe following year proved most productive. Rogers made his seventh Opening Day start that year, against the Phillies on April 9 on the road. He threw a complete game while allowing no runs on three hits, with two walks and ten strikeouts, defeating Larry Christenson for his first career Opening Day victory. He went 19–8, having a career-high in wins. He pitched four shutouts, and led all National League pitchers with a 2.40 ERA while having 179 strikeouts and 65 walks. Rogers was named to the All-Star Game for the fourth time, this time held in Montreal's Olympic Stadium. Rogers pitched the opening three innings in front of his home crowd, allowing one run on four hits with two strikeouts. He received the win as the National League struck early to win 4–1.\nIn 1983, Rogers made his eighth consecutive Opening Day start for the Expos. Facing the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, he allowed no runs on six hits while having a walk and six strikeouts. He led the National League in shutouts that year with five, matching his career high, and was named to the All-Star Game for the fifth and final time, although he did not play in the game.\nHis late career was hampered by injuries. 1984 was his last full season. He was not the Opening Day starter, with that honor going to Charlie Lea. He went 6–15 with a 4.31 ERA, appearing in 31 games with innings pitched. He had one complete game, the lowest amount in his career. He had 64 strikeouts and 78 walks, the first time that he had more walks than strikeouts. He had three errors on fielding, which was more than his last three seasons combined. He was 5th in the league in losses and 2nd in the league with wild pitches at 12.\nRogers made the Opening Day start for the Expos, his ninth and final occasion, against the Cincinnati Reds at Riverfront Stadium. Facing Mario Soto on April 8, he allowed three runs on eight hits, striking out three and walking one as the Reds prevailed 4–1. In nine Opening Day starts, he went 2–4 with three no decisions. His final appearance in the majors was on May 19, 1985, against the San Diego Padres at Olympic Stadium. In innings of work, he allowed six runs on eleven hits while walking two and striking out one in the 8–3 loss. He finished with a 2–4 record and a 5.68 ERA in eight games and 38 innings of work. He had 18 strikeouts and 20 walks. He was released by the team two days later. He later signed with the California Angels and Chicago White Sox but did not pitch for either team. His last outing was for the Edmonton Trappers, California's Triple A team in the Pacific Coast League.\nIn a 13-year career, Rogers posted a 158–152 record with a 3.17 ERA and 1621 strikeouts in innings. He pitched 129 complete games with 37 shutouts in 399 appearances, 393 as a starter. As of the end of the 2017 season, Rogers is one of 180 players to have played his entire career with one team and played for ten seasons or more, including the only one to do it with the Expos.\nPost playing career.\nRogers now resides in Princeton Junction, New Jersey, and works for the Major League Baseball Players Association."

        "title": "Piste (fencing)",
        "text": "In modern fencing, the piste or strip is the playing area. Regulations require the piste to be 14 metres long and 1.5 metres wide. The last two metres on each end are hash-marked to warn a fencer before they back off the end of the strip, after which is a 1.5 to 2 metre runoff. The piste is also marked at the centre and at the \"en garde\" lines, located two metres either side of the center line.\nRetreating off the end of the strip with both feet results in a touch awarded for the opponent. Going off the side of the strip with one or both feet halts the fencing action, and is penalized by allowing the opponent to advance one metre before being replaced on guard. If the offending fencer would then be replaced behind the rear limit of the strip because of this, a touch is awarded to the opponent. If play is halted for any reason other than stepping off the side of the piste a fencer may never be replaced on guard behind the rear line.\nAfter each touch, fencers begin again at the \"en garde\" line, 4 metres apart, or if these lines are not available, roughly at a position where their blades can nearly touch when fully extended. If no touch is scored but play was halted, the fencers come \"en garde\" at the position they were stopped.\nMost pistes at fencing tournaments are \"grounded\" to the scoring box, thus any hits that a fencer makes against the piste will not be registered as a touch. This is to prevent accidental touches to the piste from registering as off target and resulting in a halt.\nTypology.\nThere are three different types of piste:\nMade from conductive material with a rubber back; lightweight, approximately 25 kg.\nMade from sections of rolled aluminum which are bolted together; weighs approximately 300 kg\nMade from woven metal with no backing; weighs approximately 70 kg"

        "text": "The 2005–06 West Indian cricket season includes all domestic cricket matches played by senior teams with first-class status in the West Indies between October 2005 and March 2006, and also the international feats of the West Indies team, who is not scheduled to play any home games during this period but are to play home matches during April, May and June 2006. The season began on 2005-10-03 with the first matches of the one-day KFC Cup and is scheduled to last until 2006-03-19 when England A depart after their tour which will include one-day and first-class matches against the West Indies A team. The West Indies will not play any home Tests during their home season, but they have toured Australia (losing the 3-Test series 0–3), and toured New Zealand in February and March, immediately after the conclusion of the 2005-06 Carib Beer Cup, the first-class competition.\nIn domestic cricket, Guyana won the KFC Cup on home soil after going unbeaten through the group stage, though the final result was determined on the Duckworth-Lewis method. The Carib Beer Series began on 25 November with a replay of the KFC Cup final between Guyana and Barbados. The first four matches all ended in draws, and rain caused one round to be delayed until February – which also delayed the Carib Beer Challenge part of the competition until April. Trinidad and Tobago were the first teams to record a win, beating Jamaica in January, but successive wins from Barbados put them twelve points ahead of second-placed Trinidad and Tobago with the game against T&amp;T left. However, Trinidad and Tobago won by 264 runs, drawing level with Barbados in the table but winning on the head-to-head result.\nRoll of honour.\nTest series:\nOne-day International series:\nTwenty20 International:\nA tour:\nKFC Cup:\nCarib Beer Series:\nKFC Cup.\nLeague stage.\nMatchday One, 3 October.\nBefore the tournament began in Barbados, the Guyana Chronicle claimed that \"no team...[had] distinguished itself as an odds-on favourite in the competition.\" The tournament did not have a brand name sponsor until 5 October, when KFC agreed to a deal worth 3,000,000 US dollars, and the opening round was played with the tournament still named the \"President's Trophy\". Guyana recorded an opening win over Barbados, gaining a three-run win on the Duckworth-Lewis method, after West Indies Test batsman Ramnaresh Sarwan hit 106 not out before bad light stopped play with Guyana two ahead of their target score of 204, with their opponents Barbados making 244. The Windward Islands defeated reigning champions Trinidad and Tobago, in a victory described as \"remarkable\" by the Guyana Chronicle, with captain Rawl Lewis scoring 30 and taking three for 32 to become Man of the Match as Trinidad and Tobago fell from 56 for 0 to 176 all out chasing a total of 190. The Leeward Islands went top, however, after bowling Jamaica out for 145 before Runako Morton put on 133 with Junie Mitchum in a nine-wicket win that gave the Leewards a bonus point.\nMatchday Two, 4 October.\nThe following day, Guyana and the Leewards faced each other, and the Leewards became the first – and only – team to avoid defeat against the Guyanese in this year's tournament. After Leewards captain Sylvester Joseph sent Guyana in to bat, and after half-centuries from Narsingh Deonarine (52 with five fours and two sixes), and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (off 44 balls, ending with 52), along with another century from Sarwan, Guyana made a total of 291 for 5 in conditions described as \"excellent\" for batting by the Guyana Chronicle. The Leewards then struck three half-centuries from the top – Runako Morton was dropped twice on 0 before going on to make 68 – and they needed nine off the final over, getting eight off the first five balls before Carl Simon edged the final delivery to the wicket-keeper. The other matches ended in the Windwards chasing down Jamaica's 230 in 40.1 of 43 allotted overs to go top of the table with eight points – one ahead of the Leewards and two more than Guyana – while reigning champions Trinidad and Tobago lost to Barbados and were the joint bottom of the table after two games.\nMatchday Three, 6 October.\n5 October saw no matches, but the following day the Leewards went top of the table and became the first team to qualify for the Final Four after a victory described as \"miraculous\" by the Guyana Chronicle. Their opponents Trinidad and Tobago were chasing 245 to win and needed three off the last over with a wicket in hand and West Indies wicket-keeper Denesh Ramdin at the crease on 48, facing the first ball from Gavin Tonge (who had bowled nine overs for 60 previously). A fast, full-length ball saw Ramdin play across the line, missing the ball as it hit him on the pad, and the umpire gave him lbw. With no more wickets remaining, the Trinbagonians had lost by two runs. Guyana went second in the table after their seven-run win over Jamaica, with Sarwan missing out on a third successive century but still making 63 off 59 balls in a total of 219, and Jamaica then lost four wickets for 20 runs at the death to need 22 off the last eight balls; they could only get 14. The Windward Islands also went down for the first time of the season, losing to Barbados after needing seven runs off the final over. They had needed 92 with four wickets in hand in the 34th over, but Rawl Lewis and Liam Sebastien put on 81 in 14.1 overs, and Sebastien was batting with the number 10 Mervyn Matthew. He was bowled on the first ball from substitute Corey Collymore, and Alvin LaFeuille could only make four off the final five balls as the Windwards closed one run short of a tie.\nMatchday Four, 7 October.\nThe Leeward Islands were toppled from the top of the table on 7 October, after losing to Barbados in a match where Collymore took his first five-for in regional one-day competitions to become Man of the Match. Barbados had batted first, making 229 before their number 11 Tino Best was run out with seven balls remaining, but Collymore took three of the first four wickets as the Leewards were 27 for 4. 73 from captain Sylvester Joseph took them close, but Collymore returned to end with five for 27 from ten overs, helping Barbados to limit the Leewards to a total of 212 for 9 which meant that Barbados had qualified for the semis. Guyana took over the ascendancy, qualifying for the Final Four after bowling the Windward Islands out for 197 to take a 55-run win and a bonus point to boot, while Jamaica and Trinidad/Tobago – the only teams without a win in the competition – faced off at Wildey. In a match shortened to 20 overs after heavy morning rain, Jamaica bowled out the Trinbagonians for 101, with five bowlers getting wickets, before opening batsman Danza Hyatt hit 47 not out and Jamaica took a bonus point, also eliminating Trinidad and Tobago in the process. With five points, they were still fifth in the table, three points behind the Windwards.\nMatchday Five, 9 October.\nAfter a rest day, Guyana beat Trinidad and Tobago as the former finished unbeaten and the latter without a win, but the fight for the last place was between Jamaica and the Windward Islands. Jamaica did their part of the job, chasing 209 against Barbados with six overs to spare after 75 from opener Brenton Parchment (who was dropped off Collymore on 28 – Collymore ended with four overs for 10 with the scalp of Hyatt), but in the islands battle, the Windwards dismissed the Leewards for 144 after three wickets from captain Lewis, and West Indies opener Devon Smith hit 59 in the chase as the Windwards went past the target with 7.3 overs to spare, sending them into the Final Four.\nFinal four.\nSemi-Final One: Guyana v Leeward Islands, 12 October.\nGuyana beat the Leeward Islands by seven wickets to qualify for the KFC Cup Final\nThe four qualifying teams arrived in Guyana on 10 October, with the first semi-final played two days later. All three matches were played at the Bourda ground, and Guyana's Ramnaresh Sarwan became the first player to score three centuries in a domestic limited-overs tournament season, making an unbeaten 113 in a chase of a target of 242 set by the Leeward Islands in the first semi-final. Sarwan also passed Keith Arthurton's eight-year-old record tournament aggregate of 408 runs in a tournament. Earlier, Runako Morton and Wilden Cornwall had hit half-centuries as the Leewards made 241 for 8 in 50 overs, but the second-wicket partnership between opener Sewnarine Chattergoon and Sarwan was worth 109 runs, and Sarwan pushed on to make it to the target.\nSemi-Final Two: Barbados v Windward Islands, 14 October.\nBarbados beat Windward Islands by 41 runs (D-L method) to qualify for the KFC Cup Final\nThe other semi-final was played two days later in overcast conditions, and the bad light conditions brought Duckworth-Lewis into play. Barbados had made 270 for 7, with Dwayne Smith hitting 96 off 81 balls amid Kenroy Peters' three-wicket-haul, and Courtney Browne and Ian Bradshaw added 67 for the last wicket as Barbados accumulated 270 for 7. Corey Collymore took two early wickets, but the Windwards recovered to 100 for 3 in the 25th over when play was stopped. 12 overs were lost, and the Windwards set a target of 217 – they lost five wickets in the process, and could only get 75 of the 117 runs required, losing by 41 runs.\nFinal: Guyana v Barbados, 16 October.\nGuyana beat Barbados by seven runs (D-L method) to win the KFC Cup\nOn Sunday 16 October the tournament was rounded off with the Barbados v Guyana final. Barbados were inserted by the Guyana captain Chanderpaul, and though they lost no wickets in their opening 25 overs, they scored at a rate below four an over as they were 90 for no loss midway through their innings. Guyana spinners Mahendra Nagamootoo then got the first breakthrough, dismissing Kurt Wilkinson for 43, and though Martin Nurse went on to hit 63 and Ryan Hinds and Floyd Reifer also hit scores in excess of 30, Nagamootoo and Neil McGarrell shared six wickets in their 18 overs, and Barbados lost four wickets for 16 to end with a total of 249 for 8. Chasing, Guyana started with a 92-run opening partnership between Sewnarine Chattergoon and Krishna Arjune before Bradshaw and Collymore broke through for Barbados, dismissing Arjune and their West Indies team partners Sarwan and Chanderpaul, leaving Guyana at 119 for 3. TV replays indicated to Guyana Chronicle writer Allan La Rose that Chanderpaul had not hit the ball when he was given out caught behind, but in the end it mattered little – Chattergoon put on a further 90 with Deonarine, as Guyana reached 209 for 4 with 55 balls remaining, but when Deonarine was dismissed another three Guyanese followed, including Chattergoon, bowled by Fidel Edwards for 119. He later rated the innings the \"best of his life\". At the end of Edwards' over, the umpires offered the light to the batsmen, but McGarrell and Darwin Christian chose to bat on to make sure of the victory. They lost no further wicket in the next three overs before they were offered the light again, requiring three to win off the final over, which was not bowled; instead, Guyana were declared seven-run winners on the Duckworth-Lewis method.\nWest Indies in Australia.\nThe West Indies cricket team travelled to Australia in November, playing three Tests against the Australian team for the Frank Worrell Trophy. After a 0–5 whitewash on the last tour of Australia five years ago, the West Indies were hoping for a better result, but they never ran Australia closer than seven wickets in a Test match. Australia were inserted in the first Test, and after a spell after lunch yielded three wickets for Corey Collymore and Australia were 111 for 4, Ricky Ponting put on a century stand with Adam Gilchrist, and double-digit contributions from the rest of the order (excluding the number 11 Glenn McGrath) gave Australia a total of 435. West Indies were then rolled over twice, for 210 and 129, with Australia batting to 283 for 2 declared in between, as they lost by 379 runs. The second Test saw the West Indies win the toss, bat, and surrender a 257-run first-innings lead. Dwayne Bravo hit a career-best 113 in the second innings, sharing a 182-run seventh-wicket stand which set a target of 78 for the Australians, but they still won by nine wickets. Brian Lara made an unbeaten double ton on the first day of the third Test, ending on 226 to set a Test career record with his 11,204 runs at the end of the match. However, Australia made 428 when they batted, Shane Warne took six for 80 and helped take the West Indies apart to 204 in the second innings, and Matthew Hayden's 87 not out gave Australia victory on the final day. The West Indies Cricket Board later lodged a complaint with the International Cricket Council, regarding the umpiring decisions in the series, asking for video assessment of the decisions made. The ICC general manager Dave Richardson later acknowledged that errors had been made.\nCarib Beer Series.\nThe Carib Beer Cup, the league stage of the domestic first class cricket tournament of the West Indies, lasted from 25 November to 5 February. The four top teams then qualified for the Carib Beer Challenge, a direct knock-out tournament which was moved to April due to rain cancelling one of the rounds.\nCarib Beer Cup.\nGuyana v Barbados, 25–28 November.\nBarbados (6pts) drew with Guyana (3pts)\nBarbados and Guyana met for the third time in two months, this time at the Everest Cricket Club in Georgetown, Guyana, and once again Barbados failed to win, though they did gain a first innings lead and the lead in the table. After Guyana batted to a total of 241 on the first day, with Barbados bowler Ian Bradshaw taking five for 50 including top-scorer Travis Dowlin, opening batsmen Dale Richards made 127 for Barbados, as they took a first innings lead on day two. Alcindo Holder was there on 5, and he added a further 78 before he was caught behind off Nagamootoo, being last out at 394. Guyana batted out the remaining day and a half, closing on 309 for 9 to draw the match, with Guyana's Narsingh Deonarine named Man of the Match after an unbeaten 136 in the second innings. (CricketArchive scorecard)\nJamaica v Leeward Islands, 25–28 November.\nJamaica (6pts) drew with Leeward Islands (3pts)\nJamaica were criticised by the fans after this match, with their spectators voicing their concerns after Jamaica had accepted the umpires' offer of going off and taking the points for a draw in a finish described as \"enthralling\" by the Jamaica Observer. Jamaica had won the toss and decided to field, and half-centuries from Runako Morton and Shane Jeffers had sent the Leewards to 159 for 2 before slow left arm bowler Nikita Miller got two wickets in four balls. The Leewards added 26 before tea, but the post-tea session lasted 8.4 overs, yielded 11 runs, and the Leewards lost their remaining six wickets. Andrew Richardson, returning from a back injury sustained in 2003–04, took five of the wickets for four runs in his four overs, while Miller got the last wicket of Adam Sanford. On the second day, Jamaica lost five wickets for 13 runs to go to 193 for 9, but Richardson and Jerome Taylor ensured first innings points with a 30-run last-wicket stand. The Leewards openers caught up with that lead, however, and thanks to Jeffers' 88 they passed 200 in their second innings on a rain-hit third day. They ended on 242, setting a target of 216 for Jamaica, who lost Brenton Parchment and Denza Hyatt for single-digit scores to be 20 for 2. More wickets followed, as no Jamaican batsmen made it past 50, and after Carl Simon and Sanford had taken three wickets each Jamaica were at 187 for 9. The last-wicket pairing of Odean Brown and Jerome Taylor then added 25 for the last wicket, and with 7.3 overs remaining and four runs to get they were offered to go off by the umpires. With Brown's elbow damaged, their captain Tamar Lambert agreed to the offer, to end the match in a draw. (CricketArchive scorecard)\nJamaica v Windward Islands, 2–5 December.\nJamaica (6pts) drew with Windward Islands (3pts)\nAfter Jamaica had won the toss and chosen to bat, they made 204 in the first innings, which was cut in two by the rain. Six Jamaican batsmen made scores between 23 and 30 in the first innings, while Windwards bowler Kenroy Peters bowled 11 maiden overs to end with bowling figures of 20–11–18–3. The Windwards batted to 56 for one at the close, rain interrupting their innings as they were, according to a Caribbean Media Corporation report, \"looking to take control\". However, the last nine Windwards wickets fell for 71, after seamers Dave Bernard, Andrew Richardson and Nikita Miller had taken five wickets for 13 and the Windwards were at 86 for 6. Leading by 60, Jamaica added a further 188 before declaring midway through the fourth morning with number three Shawn Findlay on 70 not out. Bernard then took three wickets, helping Jamaica to take the first six wickets for 88, but Junior Murray and Rawl Lewis shared 35 for the eighth wicket in a little over an hour to halt the Jamaicans. The hosts could not force a win, as the Windwards ended on 144 for 8, but took the lead in the Carib Beer Series table. (Scorecard from West Indies Cricket Board)\nLeeward Islands v Trinidad and Tobago, 2–5 December.\nTrinidad and Tobago (6pts) drew with Leeward Islands (3pts)\nThe first day's play was entirely washed out, and the second day's play cut to 51 overs, as rain and bad light had a say in this match at Anguilla ending in a draw. Leeward Islands won the toss, and concluded their innings 20 overs into the third morning when Mervyn Dillon removed Adam Sanford, and the Leewards closed on 171. All the Trinidad bowlers got wickets, Dave Mohammed taking the most with three, and also bowling the most. Omari Banks snared two wickets for the Leewards, and Trinidad were 146 for 6 before captain Darren Ganga was joined by Richard Kelly. Both completed their half-centuries, sharing a stand of 75 before Ganga smacked a full toss from Banks to Sylvester Joseph to be out for 65 – enough to be named Man of the Match. Trinidad and Tobago were eventually bowled out for 274 midway through the morning session on day four, and the Leewards were 26 for two just before lunch, but a stand of 105 between Austin Richards and Sylvester Joseph ensured that the Leewards ended on 131 for three. (Scorecard from West Indies Cricket Board)\nThe games scheduled for the next weekend, from 9 to 12 December, were postponed due to rain and set back to February.\nTrinidad and Tobago v Jamaica, 6–9 January.\nTrinidad and Tobago (12pts) beat Jamaica (0pts) by 282 runs\nTrinidad and Tobago batted first, and after spinner Gareth Breese took four wickets on the first day, the hosts were 135 for 5, but the hosts' captain Daren Ganga hit 93 in 283 minutes before he was lbw with the score on 181. Breese got four for 44 in 18 overs on the first day, but his 19 overs on the second yielded one more wicket for 52 runs, as Dinesh Ramdin and Richard Kelly added 100 for the seventh wicket. Ramdin pressed on, his innings totalling 125 as he was left not out, and Trinidad and Tobago had made 386. Jamaica made it to 82 for 1, but Dwayne Bravo and Dave Mohammed shared seven of the last nine wickets, which fell for 111 runs. Marlon Samuels was the only batsman to pass 30 for Jamaica, ending with 63 before he was caught behind off Bravo. The hosts batted for 41 third-day overs, making 178 for 7 declared as Kelly top-scored with 43 not out, and declared 371 ahead overnight. Trinidad and Tobago had a day to bowl Jamaica out; they spent three hours, after Rayad Emrit took the first three wickets, all bowled, to end figures of 10–3–13–3 and Dave Mohammed's left arm spin yielded five for 41 to bowl Jamaica out for a total of 89. The title holders Jamaica thus fell eight points behind Trinidad and Tobago, who were the new leaders in the league (CricketArchive scorecard)\nWindward Islands v Barbados, 6–9 January.\nBarbados (6pts) drew with Windward Islands (3pts)\nThis was the fifth of six drawn matches thus far in the tournament, as rain and bad playing conditions curtailed play enough to prevent a result. Barbados batted first, and closed on 365 just before the close of play on day two, with Alcindo Holder top-scoring with 84 in his second first-class match. Windwards captain Rawl Lewis took six for 105, but coming in at eight with the total 202 for 6, he only made 17 with the bat as the Windwards were bowled out early on the fourth day, with Barbados dropping \"several chances\" on the third. Barbados hit 109 in 23 overs before declaring, but after Ryan Austin and Ryan Nurse shared four wickets and the Windwards lost their first five for 52, Junior Murray and Darren Sammy batted out the last fifty minutes to secure the draw. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nBarbados v Jamaica, 13–16 January.\nBarbados (12pts) beat Jamaica (0pts) by ten wickets\nLast year's champions Jamaica suffered their second loss on their mini-tour of the Lesser Antilles, after Barbados fast bowler Fidel Edwards removing the first three batsmen to see Jamaica to seven for three after they were inserted by Barbados captain Ryan Hinds.

Narsingh Deonarine took five for 94 in the second innings, but the Leewards still batted into the morning session on day four to make 349. Guyana did not enforce the follow on, and after the Leewards got two wickets thanks to Adam Sanford, Deonarine and Shiv Chanderpaul hit half-centuries to secure the draw. (CricketArchive scorecard)\nTrinidad and Tobago v Guyana, 20–23 January.\nTrinidad and Tobago (6pts) drew with Guyana (3pts)\nGuyana made 346 after being put in to bat at Guaracara Park, with West Indies player Ramnaresh Sarwan top-scoring with 122, but Trinidad and Tobago responded with a 159-run third wicket stand between Brian Lara and Daren Ganga. Esuan Crandon took three wickets, of Ganga, Dwayne Bravo and Sherwin Ganga, and Trinidad and Tobago were 215 for 5, needing a further 132 to gain a first innings lead. Lara continued, however, and after 270 minutes he brought up his fifth hundred at this ground. He continued to make 153, which left Trinidad and Tobago close at 332 for 8 when he was caught by Shivnarine Chanderpaul off the bowling of Crandon; Rayad Emrit took them into the lead with a half-century, and the hosts closed on 398. The last day saw some rain, and Guyana eventually closed on 159 for 3; Trinidad and Tobago captain Daren Ganga said afterwards that \"We always knew that this game was a first innings affair and we achieved the result we wanted.\". Trinidad now stood level with Barbados in the standings. (CricketArchive scorecard)\nWindward Islands v Leeward Islands, 20–23 January.\nMatch abandoned; Windward Islands (4pts), Leeward Islands (4pts)\nThe scheduled match at Mindoo Philip Park was abandoned after rain left the pitch and outfield under water.

Six on the second took Guyana out for 314, but Reon King took four of Guyana's six on the second day, and Jamaica fell to 48 for 6. Wavell Hinds and Gareth Breese added two short of that figure for the seventh wicket, and Jamaica eventually totalled 144, 20 short of the follow on target, which was not enforced. Guyana closed the third day on 114 for 6, and the Jamaica Observer claimed Jamaica needed an extraordinary effort to make it through. On the final day, Guyana were bowled out for 163, setting Jamaica 334 to win in 69 overs. Marlon Samuels spent 99 balls for his 81, as Jamaica attempted to score at the required five an over, but four wickets from Narsingh Deonarine helped bowl Jamaica out for 282, Reon King taking the last wicket by bowling Daren Powell for 57.

Hinds had opted to bat first after winning the toss, and after Leewards bowler Adam Sanford took the first four wickets at St Thomas, Hinds built partnerships with Alcindo Holder (65 for the fifth wicket) and Ian Bradshaw (141 for the seventh, the highest seventh-wicket partnership in this season's tournament. Barbados ended on 360, and after a 104-run fourth-wicket partnership between Austin Richards and Sylvester Joseph, the Leewards lost seven wickets to Ian Bradshaw and Ryan Austin. Leading by 102, Barbados built onwards, with Dwayne Smith retiring hurt on 20 but returning to make 48 and Ryan Hinds once again top-scoring with 150. The Leewards were set 409 to win in well over a day, and despite the second half-century in as many matches from Steve Liburd, Barbados bowled them out for 236 to win the match. With one game left, against Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados would secure the Carib Beer Cup title by avoiding defeat. (CricketArchive scorecard)\nTrinidad and Tobago v Windward Islands, 27–30 January.\nWindward Islands (12pts) beat Trinidad and Tobago (0pts) by 86 runs\nThe Windward Islands won their first game of the season, thwarting Trinidad's hopes of keeping up with Barbados in the league table, with Deighton Butler named Man of the Match after three wickets in the second innings. The Windwards batted first, with Hyron Shallow scoring 63 in a first innings worth 218; however, Trinidad and Tobago were reported by the Trinidad Express to have dropped eight catches.

It was not enough, however; Mohammed was left not out on 13 and Dennis George could take the final wicket as the Windwards won by 86 runs and qualified for the semi-final stages. (CricketArchive scorecard)\nBarbados v Trinidad and Tobago, 2–5 February.\nTrinidad and Tobago (12pts) beat Barbados (0pts) by 264 runs\nTrinidad and Tobago were coming off a loss in the Windward Islands three days earlier, and needed a win on both first innings and overall to wrest the Cup title from Barbados, who had a 12-point gap at the top of the table. Trinidad were put in to bat after the hosting captain won the toss, and immediately lost Imran Khan to Fidel Edwards, with the opening partnership worth seven runs. However, half-centuries from Lendl Simmons, Brian Lara and Denesh Ramdin took Trinidad and Tobago to 172 for 3, and 28 runs from Rayad Emrit helped them past 200. Edwards took three wickets, but was also the most expensive bowler, costing 87 in 17 overs.

Guyana totalled 276 to secure the first innings lead. Rain then interrupted play on the third day for nearly two hours, and Devon Smith made 63 to take the Windwards to 148 for 2, and play on the fourth day was delayed until past lunch due to a waterlogged outfield. Hyron Shallow joined Smith in the list of half-centurions as the Windwards ended on 283 for 5, Nagamootoo once again bowling the most and taking the most wickets (two for 71).

In reply, Barbados were 101 for 6 after three wickets from spinner Mahendra Nagamootoo, but half-centuries from Ian Bradshaw (81) and captain Hinds (52) helped Barbados get a first innings lead. Guyana replied with 316 for 9 declared, with both Chattergoon and Neil McGarrell scoring 82, but they needed to bowl out Barbados to win the match and proceed to the final. Floyd Reifer hit 101 for Barbados to help them earn a draw on the final day, though Guyana did peg them back from 172 for 2 to 261 for 7 after wickets from Nagamootoo and McGarrell. It was not enough, and Barbados thus had the opportunity to get revenge for the crucial league defeat to Trinidad and Tobago. (West Indies Cricket Board scorecard)\nFinal: Trinidad and Tobago v Barbados, 15–19 April.\nTrinidad and Tobago won by 125 runs and won the Carib Beer Challenge\nBrian Lara had returned to the side for the final game, which was played at Guaracara Park, Pointe-à-Pierre. Daren Ganga, T&amp;T's captain, won the toss and chose to bat, and Trinidad/Tobago lost eight wickets on the first day. According to Trinidad Guardian correspondent Naz Yacoob, \"almost all the batsmen were out to \"soft dismissals\"\", and they were described as being in \"a spot of bother\" at the end of the day, with the total on 223 for 8. Pedro Collins took three wickets, including Lara lbw for 2, and Ryan Hinds and Ian Bradshaw picked up a couple each. Rayad Emrit and Dave Mohammed then added 102 to the overnight ninth-wicket stand of 20, and though Corey Collymore and Pedro Collins managed to dismiss the two for 112 (Emrit) and 50 (Mohammed), the final Trinidad/Tobago total stood at 340. Barbados replied with 130 for 5 to close out the second day, with Emrit taking two wickets; four of the top five batsmen made double figures, but captain Hinds' score of 25 was the highest. That changed on the third day, however, as former West Indies U–19 player Kirk Edwards, on debut for Barbados, converted his overnight total of 18 to a top score of 64 before substitute fielder Sherwin Ganga held a catch off Dave Mohammed's bowling. Thanks partly to Edwards' efforts, the last five Barbados partnerships added 165, however, 60 more than the top five, as Patrick Browne (No. 7), Ian Bradshaw (No. 8) and Ryan Austin (No. 9) all passed 25, and Barbados closed their innings trailing by 70. During their third day outing, Trinidad and Tobago lost five wickets for 99 runs, including two run outs, but Richard Kelly shared a 77-run stand with Rayad Emrit across the third and fourth day to boost their lead, and eventually made 93, the second highest score of the match and the highest first class score of his career thus far. Trinidad/Tobago totalled 262 in their second innings, setting Barbados 333 to win in a day and a half, and the openers Dale Richards and Wayne Blackman cut 86 off that target. However, Barbados lost four wickets for 13 runs to Kelly and Amit Jaggernauth, and closed out the day on 110 for 4. On the final day, Trinidad/Tobago's spinners ensured that there would be no repeat of the lower order outscoring the top; Mohammed took four and Jaggernauth two, and after the 40-run sixth-wicket stand between Hinds and Browne, the last four wickets fell for 41 runs to secure the double title for Trinidad and Tobago. Emrit's efforts of 140 runs and three wickets was enough to give him Man of the Match honours. (CricketArchive scorecard)\nWest Indies in New Zealand.\nFebruary and March consisted of nine matches against New Zealand for the West Indies team – they played one Twenty20 match, five One Day Internationals, and three Tests. The tour gave poor results for the West Indies, who won one solitary match, and that was the fifth of the One Day Internationals when they were already 0–4 down in the series. They also drew one of the Tests to avoid the whitewash, and lost the Twenty20 match on a bowl out. It was not quite as poor as the tour in 1999–2000, when New Zealand won the ODIs 5–0 and the Tests 2–0, but it nevertheless meant that West Indies fell further adrift in the international rankings.\nThe U-19 team went to Sri Lanka in February, playing in the U-19 World Cup. After defeating South Africa and the United States, West Indies fell in both play-off matches, and shared seventh place with Zimbabwe.\nTwenty20 and ODIs.\nIn the Twenty20 match, West Indies had totalled 126 for 7, and New Zealand had only made 110 for 8 in their first 19 overs, with an over still to go. However, James Franklin hit the first ball of the over for six, and Shane Bond hit a four to tie the scores. Bond then broke the stumps twice in the bowl out, which New Zealand won 3–0.\nTwo days later, New Zealand totalled 288 for 9 in the first ODI, which was enough to secure victory; Ramnaresh Sarwan top-scored with 56 but took 83 balls, more than below the required run rate, and West Indies were bowled out for 207. 76 from Wavell Hinds was the highlight of the second match for the West Indies, but the total of 200 for 9 was overcome by New Zealand in 42 overs, though they were 13 for 4 after two wickets each from Fidel Edwards and Ian Bradshaw. In the third match, Nathan Astle hit a century, and though Sarwan hit his second half-century on tour West Indies were bowled out for 255, with Jeetan Patel taking three wickets. The win secured the series for New Zealand, but they weren't done; 102 from Lou Vincent helped them make a total of 324 for 6 in 50 overs, and though Runako Morton scored a century, he took 155 balls to make 110. West Indies closed on 233 for 8, well short of the required total. However, Dwayne Smith helped turn the final match West Indies' way; he took five for 45 at Eden Park as New Zealand were bowled out for 233, and though West Indies made six runs from their first six overs (and still lost the wicket of Chris Gayle) they made it to the target with three wickets and two balls to spare. However, writer Vaneisa Baksh claimed \"the win did nothing for anyone, not even for New Zealand.\"\nTest Matches.\nWest Indies lost the first two Tests, but in the final Test at Napier only 78.1 of the scheduled 450 overs were bowled, and West Indies drew to avoid recording the longest streak of Test defeats by any team apart from Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. However, after three days of the first Test, Cricinfo reported that West Indies went in \"with more than just a sniff of their first overseas win against opponents other than Bangladesh and Zimbabwe in six years.\" New Zealand had taken a lead of 18 on first innings after an unbeaten 103 and two for 23 from Scott Styris, while Dwayne Bravo had built partnerships of 89 (with Ramnaresh Sarwan) and 58 (with Dwayne Smith) to take West Indies back after being at 90 for 5. New Zealand were then 146 for 7 in reply, Bradshaw and Edwards taking out the top order, but 74 from Brendon McCullum helped New Zealand set a target of 291 in what was described as a \"see-saw match\". In reply, West Indies were 148 for no loss, but Nathan Astle broke the opening stand and Shane Bond picked up four wickets as the team fell to 263 and a 27-run defeat. Brian Lara was bowled by Bond for a golden duck.\nThe next match was also won by New Zealand, whose first innings total of 372 was the highest all series; West Indies' two totals of 192 and 218 were the two lowest in completed innings. Despite lacking Shane Bond, New Zealand's bowlers got the twenty wickets required, with James Franklin taking seven including a first-innings five-for and Kyle Mills six. With New Zealand helped by half-centuries from Peter Fulton, Stephen Fleming and Nathan Astle then defied Fidel Edwards, who got five for 65, and New Zealand made it to a series-clinching ten-wicket win after 23 not out from Hamish Marshall. In the third Test, West Indies made it to 256 for 4 in the 78.1 overs possible on the first two days, and the other three were rained off as the match ended in a draw."

        "title": "Thomas Henderson (American football)",
        "text": "Thomas Henderson (born March 1, 1953), nicknamed \"Hollywood\", is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys, San Francisco 49ers, Houston Oilers, and Miami Dolphins. He played college football at Langston University.\nEarly years.\nHenderson was raised by his teenage mother on the east side of Austin, Texas and played football for the L. C. Anderson High School \"B\" team until his sophomore year (1969), when he moved to Oklahoma City to live with his grandmother and find a more stable environment.\nAlthough as a senior he earned All-City honors playing defensive end at Douglass High School, he was not recruited by colleges because his career had been shortened, after having to sit out his junior year after transferring. After graduation Henderson joined the Air Force, but quit before being sworn in.\nCollege career.\nHenderson was a walk-on for the football team at the NAIA Langston University. His personality earned him the nickname \"Wild Man\" and helped him become a two-time small-college All-American defensive end.\nAs a senior, he contributed to the team's 11–1 record and a playoff appearance. He was named Southwest district Defensive Player of the Year. He started 45 straight games in his college career. He also practiced track and field, competing in the 100-yard dash (9.5 seconds) and the triple jump (49 feet).\nIn 2002, he was inducted into the Langston University Athletic Hall of Fame. In 2018, he was inducted into the Black College Football Hall of Fame.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nHenderson was selected in the first round (18th overall) of the 1975 NFL Draft, as part of the Dallas Cowboys Dirty Dozen draft. As a rookie, he focused on special teams. He returned a reverse handoff for a 97-yard kickoff return for a touchdown (fourth in franchise history) during the second game against the St. Louis Cardinals. He blocked a punt in the fourteenth game against the New York Jets.\nIn 1976, he competed with D.D. Lewis for the starting strongside linebacker position. He remained as a backup and core special teams player. He blocked a punt out of the end zone for a safety in the twelfth game against the St. Louis Cardinals.\nIn 1977, he was named the starting strongside linebacker over Randy White, who was moved to defensive tackle. He posted 53 tackles, 3 interceptions, one sack (unofficial) and 2 fumble recoveries. He returned an interception for a 79-yard touchdown against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He also claimed that he introduced the crossbar slam dunk celebration into the NFL at the end of the play. He led the team with 7 tackles in Super Bowl XII. Henderson gave himself the nickname \"Hollywood\" for his flamboyant play and high-visibility lifestyle.\nIn 1978, he couldn't start in 3 games because of an ankle injury. He returned an interception for a 68-yard touchdown (including a crossbar slam dunk) in the 28–0 NFC championship win against the Los Angeles Rams. Before Super Bowl XIII he started a war of words against the Pittsburgh Steelers, that ended up with him sharing a \"Newsweek\" magazine cover with quarterback Terry Bradshaw. He also pinned Bradshaw's arms, allowing linebacker Mike Hegman to steal the ball and run 37 yards for a touchdown in Super Bowl XIII. He was selected to the Pro Bowl at the end of the season.\nEven though he had great potential as a player, Henderson's destructive lifestyle of drugs and alcohol began to catch up with him. During many games, he snorted liquid cocaine from an inhaler he hid in his pants. The final straw came in 1979, during the twelfth game against the Washington Redskins at RFK Stadium. While his team was being soundly beaten 34–20 on national television, Henderson mugged for the camera and displayed handkerchiefs with the Cowboys team logo. When interviewed about it, he blamed teammate Preston Pearson, saying that Pearson had asked him to show off the handkerchiefs, which Pearson was marketing, as a favor. Coach Tom Landry was so angered by the episode that after threatening to waive him, he instead deactivated Henderson for the remainder of the season by placing him on the reserve-retired list. According to sources close to the team, Landry did not intend for Henderson to ever play for the Cowboys again, even though the coach was still personally fond of Henderson.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nOn May 15, 1980, he was traded to the San Francisco 49ers in exchange for a fourth round draft choice (#91, Scott Pelluer). On September 19, he was waived after only playing one game. Henderson believed that 49ers coach Bill Walsh unloaded him because he suspected he was addicted to cocaine.\nHouston Oilers.\nOn September 24, 1980, he signed as a free agent with the Houston Oilers. He appeared in only six games because of a hamstring injury and played in the Oilers' . He was not re-signed after the season.\nMiami Dolphins.\nIn February 1981, he became one of the first football players to publicly admit to a drug problem, and with the help of the NFL, he signed himself into a drug rehabilitation program. On June 10, Henderson signed with the Miami Dolphins, but suffered what proved to be a career-ending neck injury in the final preseason game against the Kansas City Chiefs. On August 31, he was placed on the injured reserve list. He was not re-signed after the season.\nPersonal life.\nLawrence Taylor, said that he was inspired to wear 56 because it was Henderson's number.\nHenderson briefly dated Anita Pointer of the Pointer Sisters.\nIn November 1983, Henderson was arrested and charged with two counts of false imprisonment and one count each of forced oral copulation, sexual battery and furnishing cocaine to a minor.\nThe felony counts include an allegation that Henderson used a gun while committing the crimes, according to prosecutor Jim Cosper.\nHe was arrested after a 15-year-old girl claimed he lured her and a 17-year-old girl, a paraplegic wheelchair user, to the apartment the night before.\nThe younger girl told police Henderson pulled out a handgun and forced her to have sex with him before he assaulted both girls and threatened to kill them.\nPolice said they found a .38 caliber handgun in Henderson's apartment, along with narcotics paraphernalia. He claimed that he gave them drugs in exchange for consensual sex. Henderson had no history of assaults or sexual misconduct prior to the 1983 incident. He pleaded no contest to the charges and entered a treatment center and remained there for seven months before his 28 months in prison. He states that \"Hollywood\" died on November 8, 1983, and he has remained clean and sober ever since.\nHenderson made the news again in 2000 by winning the Lotto Texas US$28 million jackpot. He started a charity (East Side Youth Services &amp; Street Outreach) and has made major donations to the East Austin community where he grew up. He currently gives motivational speeches and sells videos of his anti-drug seminars (HHH 56 Investments Ltd.). When asked by \"The Dallas Morning News\" what he does every day having won the lottery, Henderson responded, \"Not a damn thing, and I don't start that until after lunch\". He is the father of two daughters and has five grandchildren. Henderson says crack cocaine was his downfall, and that embarrassing his mother, family and friends ultimately changed him. He is now retired and lectures across the United States."

He led Lincoln to two state titles, and made all-state twice. He captained the 1967 team, and earned four prep letters, including one each in football and baseball. Due to his outside shooting skills, his high school nickname \"Downtown Freddie\" Brown followed him for his entire career.\nBrown finished his senior year at the University of Iowa in 1971, averaging 27.6 points per game, and was selected by the Kentucky Colonels in the American Basketball Association draft and selected 6th overall by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1971 NBA draft.\nNBA.\nBrown's NBA career got off to a slow start, as he averaged only 4.2 points per game in 33 games as a rookie, playing behind veteran guards Lenny Wilkens and Dick Snyder. Following Wilkens' trade to the Cleveland Cavaliers in 1972, Brown saw more playing time and his scoring average rose to 13.5 and 16.5 points per game in the next two seasons.\nAfter Snyder was traded to the Cavaliers in 1974, Brown's output increased again, to 21.0 points per game in the 1974–75 season and he finished fifth in the league in steals per game. In the 1975–76 season, Brown had an All-Star season finishing fifth in the NBA in both scoring average and free throw percentage.\nBrown continued as a starter for the Sonics through the 1976–77 season and the start of the 1977–78 season. However, when Lenny Wilkens took over as coach after a slow start, he decided to pair new free-agent signing Gus Williams and second-year guard Dennis Johnson in the Sonics' starting backcourt and bring Brown off the bench. He dubbed Brown \"Instant Offense\". The Sonics made the NBA Finals that season and the next, winning the NBA championship in 1978–79.\nBrown was captain of the SuperSonics' 1978–79 NBA championship team. Often among the league leaders in free-throw percentage, Brown also led the NBA in three-point shooting percentage in 1979–80—the first season in which the three-point line was adopted by the league.\nLegacy.\nWhen he retired in 1984, Brown was the SuperSonics' all-time leader in:\nBrown still holds the team's all-time marks for points in a regular season game with 58 (a record shared with Russell Westbrook), points in a playoff game with 45 (a record shared with Ray Allen), and steals in a game with 10 (a record shared with Gus Williams).\nBrown's #32 SuperSonics jersey was retired November 6, 1986 in honor of his career with the SuperSonics.\nBrown continues to reside in the Seattle area and is one of the former players lobbying to bring NBA basketball back to Seattle after the SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City in 2008.\nPopular culture references.\nBrown is one of five 1970s Seattle SuperSonics players whose names are featured on characters in \"The Exterminator,\" the third episode of Season 1 of \"iZombie\". The other four are Gus Williams, Wally Walker, Marvin Webster and Don Watts."

The title proclaimed \"It's March!\" and included a picture of Brown popping the front of his jersey towards the crowd.\nSenior year.\nWith Williams and Head in the NBA, Brown and fellow senior James Augustine led the Illini to a 26–7 record. Brown had played shooting guard for his first three years at Illinois. But since Deron Williams, who played point guard in his years at Illinois, had left for the NBA, Brown returned to his primary position of point guard for his senior season. His last game was the 67–64 loss to Washington in the second round of the 2006 NCAA Tournament. After the season, Brown was named Second-Team All-American by the Associated Press. He received the sixth-most votes, making him the leading vote getter on the second team. Also, he was named the winner of the Bob Cousy Award for 2006, given to the nation's top collegiate male point guard.\nMemorable games included a career-high 34 points at home against Michigan State on January 5, 2006, and 14 points in a win on the road against UNC in the ACC/Big Ten Challenge (avenging the loss to UNC in the previous season's NCAA championship game in St. Louis). Brown led in the Fighting Illini in points (14.2), assists (5.8), steals (1.6) and minutes (35.8).\nWhen he retired his famous orange headband, he ended perhaps the finest four years in the school's history. Brown is the winningest player in Illinois history (tied with James Augustine) with 114 victories, leads in all-time minutes (4,698) and started the most games (136) of any player in school history. Brown played in 137 games during his career, the second most in school history (tied with James Augustine), he was third on the Illini all-time scoring chart with 1,812 career points and second in school history in career 3-pointers (299), career assists (674) and career steals (231). His career assists total ranks fifth in Big Ten history, while his career 3-pointers and career steals totals rank sixth in Big Ten history. Brown is also Illinois' record holder in the NCAA Tournament for career points (179) and career field goals (64).\nPro career.\nNBA.\nDuring the 2006 NBA draft, Brown was selected 46th overall by the Utah Jazz but was not offered a guaranteed contract. Brown attended the team's training camp in the fall, where he and various undrafted players competed for a roster spot. On August 29, 2006 Dee Brown signed with the Jazz and was reunited with former college teammates Deron Williams and Roger Powell, who also signed with the team.\nOn November 14, 2006, Brown scored his first points in the NBA with a pair of free throws against the Los Angeles Clippers. Through the first month of the NBA season, Brown played off the bench in eight of the Jazz's seventeen games. Brown played in 49 games during his rookie season, averaging just under two points per game.\nAfter spending the 2007–08 season with Galatasaray Café Crown in Turkey, he was signed by the Washington Wizards to an offer sheet for a two-year, partially guaranteed deal on July 9, 2008. Since Brown was still a restricted free agent at the time, the Jazz were given one week to match the offer, but declined to do so since they were already stocked at point guard. Brown officially signed with the Wizards as a free agent on July 30.\nDue to an injury to guard Gilbert Arenas, Brown broke into the Wizards rotation, eventually becoming the starting point guard. Brown averaged 2.4 points and 1.9 assists in 17 games with the Wizards.\nBrown was released by the Wizards on December 10, 2008 to make room for Mike James and Javaris Crittenton, two guards acquired by the Wizards via trade. On December 23 Brown was signed by the Phoenix Suns, who were looking for a backup point guard. After playing two games in which he averaged 2.5 points and 1.5 assists per game, Brown was released. In 2010 the Dallas Mavericks invited Brown to their training camp, but he was waived on October 21.\nOverseas.\nOn September 22, 2007, Brown decided that he would play the 2007–08 season for Galatasaray Café Crown of the Turkish Basketball League rather than try to make the Jazz's roster in training camp.\nOn January 23, 2009, Brown signed a contract with Israeli power house Maccabi Tel Aviv for the remainder of the 2008–09 season. He was signed ahead of the top 16 stage of the Euroleague to team-up with former NBA player Carlos Arroyo in Maccabi's back court.\nBrown signed with Air Avellino of the Italian Basketball Federation on August 11, 2009.\nOn November 16, 2010, Brown signed with the Qingdao DoubleStar Eagles of the Chinese Basketball Association.\nIn April 2011, he signed a contract with Piratas de Quebradillas in Puerto Rico.\nOn July 21, 2011, he signed with the Italian team Teramo Basket.\nIn the summer of 2012, he signed a contract with Türk Telekom.\nOn July 31, 2013, Brown signed with Latvian champions VEF Rīga of the VTB United League and ULEB Eurocup.\nOn August 8, 2014, he signed a one-year deal with the Romanian team CSU Asesoft Ploiești. On January 21, 2015, he left Asesoft, and signed with PBC Lukoil Academic in Bulgaria.\nBrown announced his retirement from playing professional basketball in September 2015.\nPost playing career.\nOn September 8, 2015, Brown was hired by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as a special assistant to Athletic Director Mike Thomas, after his contractual obligation to Lukoli Academic ended. In April 2016, Brown was made the Director of Player Development and Alumni Relations for the school's men's basketball program.\nIn October 2016, Brown resigned from his position at the University of Illinois, citing personal reasons. Brown commented on his departure through Twitter, saying, \"I've been dealing with some personal issues that have weighed heavily on me. ... After much thought, I've made the tough decision to leave my position. I will always have love for my school and basketball program.\"\nOn August 29, 2017, Brown was hired as an assistant coach for the University of Illinois-Chicago men's basketball team.\nBrown was named head coach of the Roosevelt University men’s basketball team on June 27, 2022.

        "title": "Tom Burns (baseball)",
        "text": "Thomas Everett Burns (March 30, 1857 – March 19, 1902) was an American infielder and manager in Major League Baseball, primarily for the Chicago White Stockings/Colts/Orphans. He also played for, and managed, the Pittsburgh Pirates for part of one season, and he returned to the Chicago team for two years as its manager after his major-league playing career ended.\nIn the last few years of his life, Burns managed in the minor leagues. He died of heart problems in New Jersey at the age of 44. His brother, John Burns, was a National League umpire.\nEarly life and playing career.\nBurns was born in 1857 in Honesdale, Pennsylvania. He joined the Chicago team in the National League (then known as the White Stockings) in 1880. A nondrinker and nonsmoker, Burns stayed on the good side of Chicago manager Cap Anson because of his tame lifestyle. He sported a red handlebar mustache during his playing career.\nFrom 1883 to 1889, Burns was part of a Chicago infield combination that manager Cap Anson described as a \"stonewall infield\". Some sportswriters also picked up the term, even though several infields had better fielding statistics. Burns led the league in putouts and assists multiple times. Chicago won league pennants in 1885 and 1886.\nOn September 6, 1883, Burns had one of the most productive innings in baseball history when he hit two doubles and a home run during an 18-run seventh inning for Chicago. His three hits and three runs set single-inning records; teammates Ned Williamson and Fred Pfeffer also had three hits in the inning. The White Stockings won the game 26–6. No other major-league player had a three-hit inning until 1953.\nIn 1888, Burns was a member of an American baseball team that left the U.S. on a world baseball tour that would end up in Australia.\nManagerial career.\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates purchased Burns from Chicago in 1892. Transitioning into a player-manager role, Burns led a talented Pittsburgh Pirates team. Though the team had two future members of the Baseball Hall of Fame – Joe Kelley and Jake Beckley – the team started the season with a 25–30 record and Burns was dismissed.\nFrom 1893 through 1897, Burns became a minor-league manager with the Springfield Ponies of the Eastern League, and he made appearances as a player for the Ponies until 1896. In 1898, the Chicago Orphans initially denied that Burns was being hired to replace Anson. Anson had written a letter to Burns in which he said that Burns was his ideal successor, but Anson said that it had not been written with the thought that he would actually resign.\nDespite the initial denials, Burns did become Chicago's manager for 1898 and 1899. He led the team to an 85–65 record in his first season, and a 75–73 record the next year. He resigned after the 1899 season. According to newspaper accounts at the time, Burns showed impressive knowledge of the game but was too nice to his players, often failing to control his team off the field. Burns returned as the Springfield manager in 1900, and he managed the Buffalo Bisons for part of the 1901 season.\nPersonal.\nBurns's brother John was hired as a National League umpire in 1884, but he was fired in August of that year.\nDeath.\nBefore the 1902 baseball season, Burns was hired as the manager of an Eastern League team based in Jersey City, New Jersey. On a mid-March trip to that area, he became ill. Patrick T. Powers, the president of the Eastern League, invited Burns to his home to rest. Burns said that he felt better on the evening of March 18, but he was found dead in bed at Powers's home the next morning. A doctor was consulted, and he attributed the death to heart disease. He is interred St. Michael Cemetery in Springfield, Massachusetts."

        "text": "Horace B. Phillips (May 14, 1853 – February 26, 1896) was an American manager in Major League Baseball for eight seasons, from 1879 to 1889. He managed one season for the Troy Trojans, one season for the Philadelphia Athletics (American Association), one season for the Columbus Buckeyes and six seasons for the Pittsburgh Alleghenys. He was born in Salem, Ohio.\nOn June 6, 1882, Phillips was arrested in Philadelphia for not paying a hotel bill from 1882. He claimed that A. J. Reach was put in charge of paying it, but he eventually paid the bill himself and was released.\nShortly after his time in Pittsburgh, Phillips was institutionalized for mental illness in the Kirkbride's Asylum in Philadelphia, then later in a private hospital in Merchantville, New Jersey. His wife divorced him in 1894. He died in 1896, and is buried at Mount Vernon Cemetery in Philadelphia."

        "title": "2009 Rugby League Four Nations",
        "text": "The 2009 Rugby League Four Nations tournament (officially known as the Gillette Four Nations due to sponsorship) was the first Rugby League Four Nations since its expansion from the Tri-Nations tournament. Played in England and France over three weeks from Friday, 23 October until Saturday, 14 November, France and England competed for the first time, with Great Britain's permanent split into the home nations' national teams following the 2007 New Zealand All Golds Tour. The tournament culminated in a final between world number 1 side Australia and hosts England. After 60 minutes of highly competitive football, Australia ran away with the match, scoring a barrage of late tries to win 46–16.\nThe 2009 series was the first of three Four Nations series planned before the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, with the venues rotating between Europe and the South Pacific. The RLIF also stated that the next Four Nations would be held in 2010.\nBackground.\nThe Four Nations is run in partnership between the Australian Rugby League, Rugby Football League and New Zealand Rugby League representing the top three nations in the sport: Australia, England and New Zealand. A fourth partner, Fédération Française de Rugby à XIII, accepted an invitation to enter France in the inaugural 2009 tournament.\nTeams.\nEach team was to play the other three once during the round robin tournament. The top two finishing teams would then contest the final.\nSquads.\nEach nation was to choose a 24-man squad in order to participate for the Four Nations.\nAustralia.\nAustralian coach Tim Sheens' squad for the tournament was:\nOf the twenty four players, twenty three were Australian born while one was Fijian born.\nNew Zealand.\nCoach: Stephen Kearney\nOf the twenty four players, nineteen were New Zealand born while four were Australian born and one was Tongan born.\n1 Ruled out of the rest of the series on 5 November after breaking his hand in the Round two victory over France.\n2 Registered as a member of the squad before the tournament started but this was not revealed to the media until he was called to Europe from Australia by the Kiwis on 25 October.\n3 The only non National Rugby League player in the squad.\nEngland.\nCoach: Tony Smith\nAll twenty four players were English born.\n1 Replaced originally selected Sean O'Loughlin who withdrew due to injury.\n2 The only non Super League player in the squad.\nFrance.\nCoach: Bobbie Goulding\nOf the twenty seven players, eighteen were French born while three were Australian born, three New Zealand born, one Moroccan born and one New Caledonia born.\nVenues.\nThere were several venues used during the tournament throughout England and France.\nFinal.\nThe Four Nations Final was played at the Elland Road stadium in Leeds, England.\nReferees.\nFour referees were nominated for the tournament by the governing bodies of the participating teams. One from each of the participating nations. The nominated referees were:\nPre-tournament matches.\nBefore the series, New Zealand and England played additional Tests against Tonga and Wales respectively.\nNew Zealand vs Tonga.\nNew Zealand led 24–8 at half-time before Tonga fought back to level the scores at 24-24. New Zealand went on to score 16 unanswered points to win the match 40–24.\nWales vs England.\nEngland lead Wales 20-12 approaching the hour, before racking up 28 points in the last quarter.\nResults.\nRound one.\nEngland vs France.\nAfter trailing 12–4 at half-time, England scored 30 consecutive points to defeat France 34–12, who were coached by former Great Britain half, Bobbie Goulding.\nNew Zealand vs Australia.\nFor Australia Ben Hannant, Brett Morris and Brett White were selected to make their debuts. Petero Civoniceva was selected despite not having played any football since he injured his leg in game 2 of the 2009 State of Origin series in June.\nWhen Australian captain Darren Lockyer took the field for this match, he surpassed Mal Meninga's record for most international caps for the Kangaroos. After 6–6 at half-time, Australia quickly went to a 14–6 lead before New Zealand scored fourteen points in a row to make it 14–20. Australia's Cameron Smith scored a try and Johnathan Thurston made the conversion to level the scores with less than five minutes left to play. The score finished at 20-20. The crowd of 12,360 at Twickenham Stoop stadium set a new attendance ground record for a rugby league match.\nRound two.\nEngland vs Australia.\nChanges made to the Australian side included the removal of Sam Thaiday, Ryan Hoffman, Trent Waterhouse and Kurt Gidley. Taking their places were débutants Luke Lewis and David Shillington as well as Robbie Farah and also Nathan Hindmarsh, making his test football comeback.\nAustralian captain Darren Lockyer equalled Ken Irvine's record of 33 test tries for Australia by scoring in this match. On a warm and sunny day, the Kangaroos went into half-time 26-0 up and after Australia defeated England 52–4 in their previous meeting in last year's Rugby League World Cup, the English looked set for another thrashing. However, England made an ambitious fight-back in the second half but, keeping Australia scoreless to lose by a more respectable margin of 26–16. Towards the end of the match, Johnathan Thurston was sent to the sin bin.\nNew Zealand vs France.\nNew Zealand were leading 16–6 at half-time. France got to within 4 points of New Zealand at 16-12 before New Zealand scored 46 points in a row to comfortably win 62–12. New Zealand's Bryson Goodwin scored 22 individual points and Sam Perrett scored a hat-trick of tries. This loss ended the French hopes of making the finals.\nRound three.\nAustralia vs France.\nThe Kangaroos had not played in Paris since 1994. They went into the match having won their last 14 matches against France. Due to French laws prohibiting the use of alcohol advertising in sport, the Australian jerseys' usual Victoria Bitter logo was replaced by one for Movember. Debuting for Australia were Brett Morris' twin brother Josh Morris and New South Wales State of Origin centre Michael Jennings. By playing in this match, Darren Lockyer surpassed Clive Churchill's record for most games as Australian captain.\nFor the first 20 minutes the contest was quite even, being played at both ends of the field with both sides getting and conceding penalties. It was the Australians who scored first when debutant Michael Jennings dummied his way through the defence from 20 metres out to score out wide. Johnathan Thurston's conversion attempt missed, so France were down 4 nil with 18 minutes of the first half remaining. Jennings also scored the second try of the match in the 27th minute when Lockyer threw a cutout pass to him in front of France's line. Thurston again failed to add the extras, so the score remained at 8 nil. The score did not change from then till half time, with both sides' defence holding each other's attacking opportunities out.\nAfter receiving France's kick-off and making their way up-field with the help of a penalty, the Australians scored in only the 2nd minute of the half when Luke Lewis powered his way through the defence from about 12 metres out. With Cooper Cronk on the field instead of Johnathan Thurston, Kurt Gidley was given kicking duties and converted the try, pushing Australia's lead out to 14 nil. In the 45th minute the Kangaroos scored again after a Cooper Cronk 40/20 kick put them in an attacking position and they moved the ball out to Brett Morris' wing where he dived over untouched in the corner. Gidley's sideline conversion attempt missed so the score was 18 nil. Morris got his second try just a few minutes later when Darren Lockyer kicked ahead for him from 35 metres out. Gidley kicked the extras so Australia's lead was 24 nil. the Kangaroos continued to dominate possession and in the 56th minute Jennings got his hat-trick with a long-range try when he regathered a French dropped ball 30 metres out from Australia's line. Jennings thus became the 4th Kangaroo since Lionel Morgan in 1960, Brad Mackay in 1990 and David Williams in 2008 to score a hat-trick on debut for Australia. Thurston, back on the field kicked his first successful goal of the match to push the score out to 30 nil with over 25 minutes of play to go. In the 61st minute France made the most of an attacking opportunity when Tomas Bosc kicked over the Australian defence where Olivier Elima leapt for it, coming down with the ball over the line. Bosc's conversion attempt missed so the score was 30–4 with 18 minutes remaining. Josh Morris then got a try at the 69-minute mark when he received the ball from his twin brother Brett after the Australians had kept the ball alive. Thurston kicked the extras so the score was 36–4. Josh Morris then got his second try a little over 2 minutes later when the Australians moved the ball out to his wing from a scrum win 30 metres out. Thurston's successful conversion made the score 42-4 and this is what it would be at the final whistle.\nThe victory for Australia meant they would face the winner of the match between New Zealand and England to be played in Huddersfield later that evening.\nNew Zealand vs England.\nThe last time these two sides met was in the 2008 World Cup when they played each other for the chance to face Australia in the final. On that occasion New Zealand won, sending England back home. This time they were playing for the chance to face Australia in the Four Nations final. New Zealand could draw and still make the final, while England needed to win to advance. In all of England's prior games, they had lost the first half but had won and not conceded a point in the second half.\nFor this match England coach Tony Smith dropped Danny McGuire, Lee Smith and Tom Briscoe in favour of Peter Fox, Chris Bridge and Jon Wilkin. For New Zealand, Greg Eastwood and Steve Matai were out with injury so Jeff Lima was recalled and 19-year-old Kieran Foran was brought in to make his international debut ahead of Krisnan Inu.\nEngland got the first points of the match when they attacked up the middle, Sam Burgess spinning out of a tackle to send Kyle Eastmond over under the black dot just on 9 minutes. Sinfield's conversion from right in front was successful so England were out to a 6 nil lead. New Zealand responded 5 minutes later, moving the ball out wide to Bryson Goodwin's wing where he dived over in the corner. He couldn't convert his own try though, so the score was left at 6–4. In the 29th minute New Zealand were awarded a penalty right in front of the goal-posts and took the two points, leveling the score at 6 all. Six minutes later England were up at the Kiwis' end of the field again, attacking the line, when Sam Tomkins kicked across-field to Peter Fox's corner where the winger dived on the ball. Sinfield kicked the extras from the sideline so England were again a converted try in front with just over 4 minutes remaining. England continued dominating field position and scored again in the 39th minute from a scrum win near England's line, the ball going through the hands out to Peter Fox to score his second. Sinfield again added the extras, pushing England's lead out to 18–6.\nNew Zealand opened the scoring after just a minute and a half into the second hand when at the halfway line Isaac Luke made a break from dummy-half, his offload finding support players who got the ball out to Ben Matulino who scored. Bryson Goodwin's kick added the extras, bringing the Kiwis back within a converted try, trailing 18–12. The play for the next half-hour went from end to end, with both teams getting good attacking opportunities but both teams' defences holding them out. Then when England were close to New Zealand's line they were awarded a penalty for ruck interference and with less than 10 minutes remaining, decided to take the kick for an 8-point lead. Sinfield's kick was successful so the score was 20–12 in favour of the home team. England were able to hold New Zealand out for the remaining minutes of the match and so earned a place in the final. Kevin Sinfield, in the unfamiliar position of hooker was named man-of-the-match.\nFinal.\nThe Australian team for the final had the Queensland team's halves pairing, front row, centre pairing and fullback, while both wingers, the whole back row, three-quarters of the bench and the coach were New South Walshmen.\nBy playing in this match, Darren Lockyer became the first Australian in history to play in fifty international matches for his country. In addition, teammate and fellow Queenslander, Petero Civoniceva became the most-capped forward, breaking Johnny Raper's record by earning his 40th cap.\nIt took Australia till the ninth minute to cross England's line. Quick passing out to Brett Morris on the right wing saw him dive over in the corner, but the video referee ruled that he'd lost control of the ball in the grounding of it so no try was allowed. In England's very next set of six, they had reached Australia's half when NRL-bound loose forward Sam Burgess charged through the Kangaroos' defence, running forty-five metres and dummying past the fullback to score under the posts. Sinfield's conversion put England ahead 6 nil after eleven minutes of play. In the fourteenth minute Australia responded: a cut-out pass from Johnathan Thurston on England's try-line was flicked on by Justin Hodges' fingertips to Morris, who this time got his try. Thurston kicked the conversion from near the sideline so the scores were level at 6 all. A few minutes later England were back attacking Australia's line, when on the final tackle Eastmond put a kick up to his right winger Peter Fox, who beat Jarryd Hayne in the leap for the ball to come down with the try, putting the home team back in front. Sinfield missed the conversion attempt so the score was 10–6 with twenty minutes of the first half remaining. Five minutes later Hayne made a good break from half way, kicking ahead for Greg Inglis to chase through and ground the ball. The video referee checked Inglis' grounding and gave him the benefit of the doubt. Thurston kicked the extras so Australia had the lead again 12–10 with fourteen minutes of the first half left. At the thirty-minute mark England were penalised right in front of their goal posts and Australia opted to take the kick, Thurston's boot pushing Australia's lead out to four. No further points were scored in the first half so they went into the break at England 10, Australia 14.\nAfter ten minutes of sustained pressure on Australia's defence England were through, Burgess again charging over under the posts from close range. Sinfield's kick added the Extras so once again England had the lead at 16–14. A little over three minutes later it was Australia attacking England's line when their fullback Billy Slater dove over from dummy-half, the lead changing again to be back with the Kangaroos. Thurston couldn't get the conversion so Australia's lead stayed at only two points, 18–16. In the fifty-eighth minute the Kangaroos were on the attack again when Thurston chipped ahead from twenty metres out for Brett Morris to chase through and score in the corner behind the England defence. The conversion attempt by Thurston was missed so Australia lead 22–16 with twenty-one minutes of the match remaining. Shortly after the kick-off following the try England's Michael Shenton suffered a head clash when trying to tackle front-row forward Ben Hannant and the game was halted as he was stretchered unconscious from the field. Moments after the restart of play Hannant himself was concussed when tackled by James Graham but played on. Australia scored a remarkable try after sixty-six minutes when Darren Lockyer chipped over the top into England's in goal and Slater, chasing through leapt over the dead ball line to slap the ball back in with his hand for Cameron Smith to dive on and claim the four points. Thurston's kick from right in front did not miss so Australia lead 28–16. As the Kangaroos returned the ball after a short kick-off from England they reached the opposition's end of the field and Slater scored again after backing up a good break from Smith. The conversion from Thurston was an easy one so the score was 34–16 in favour of the visitors with under ten minutes of the match remaining. In the seventy-third minute Jarryd Hayne got a try after running through to chase a Lockyer grubber. Thurston added the extras, Australia's lead now 40–16 with a little over five minutes left to play. The Australians got one more try though when Kurt Gidley made a break around the halfway line and kicked ahead, Billy Slater winning the race to the ball to claim his hat-trick in the seventy-seventh minute. Man-of-the-match Thurston added the extras so the score was 46-16 when the final hooter sounded. It was England's heaviest loss to Australia on home soil.\nBroadcast details.\nThe competition was televised in Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain and France."

        "text": "Jamie Blane Martin (born February 8, 1970) is an American former football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) and NFL Europe. He played college football for the Weber State Wildcats and was signed by the Los Angeles Rams as an undrafted free agent after the 1993 NFL Draft.\nMartin was also a member of the Washington Redskins, the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Cleveland Browns, the New York Jets, the New Orleans Saints, the San Francisco 49ers, and the Amsterdam Admirals.\nEarly years.\nMartin attended Arroyo Grande High School in Arroyo Grande, California.\nHe led his team to the California Interscholastic Federation championship in 1987, when he completed 170 of 276 passes (61.6 percent) for 2,259 yards and 16 touchdowns. Overall during his prep career for AGHS, Martin accumulated 4,955 passing yards and 40 TDs, each Northern League records at the time.\nCollege career.\nMartin starred at Weber State University from 1989 to 1992. As a freshman, he played in eight games, but showed few glimpses of his future greatness. Martin struggled as he adjusted to football at the college level; he completed just 86 of 233 passes for 1,175 yards and nine touchdowns.\nThe next year (1990) was Martin's breakout season. He completed 256 of 428 passes for 3,700 yards and 23 touchdowns. He led the NCAA Division I-AA in passing (336.4 yards per game) and total offense (337.6 yards per game). He was named first-team All-Big Sky Conference.\nMartin followed his strong sophomore campaign with a spectacular junior year (1991). He completed 310 of 500 passes for 4,125 yards and 35 touchdowns. He again led Division I-AA in passing (375.0 yards per game) and total offense (394.3 yards per game). With Martin at the helm, Weber State's offense averaged 578.5 yards per game, setting a national record. Martin set Division I-AA records for pass completions (47), passing yards (624), and total offense yards (643) in a game against Idaho State. He also had a spectacular performance against Eastern Washington, throwing seven touchdown passes in that game. For his efforts, Martin was named a First Team All-American and was awarded the Walter Payton Award, given annually to the top FCS player in the nation.\nHis senior season (1992) was solid, but his statistics declined from the previous year. He finished with 282 completions in 383 attempts, totaling 3,207 yards and 20 touchdown passes. He led the Big Sky in passing (291.5 yards per game) and earned third-team All-American honors. \nMartin finished his career as the all-time leader in passing (12,207 yards) and total offense (12,287 yards) in the history of Division I-AA football. His 87 career touchdown passes were a Big Sky record.\nHe played in the 1993 East–West Shrine Game and the Hula Bowl.\nProfessional career.\nFirst stint with Rams.\nDespite his tremendous collegiate career, Martin was not drafted into the NFL. He signed a free agent contract with the Los Angeles Rams in 1993. He spent four seasons with the Rams franchise (two in Los Angeles, two after the team moved to St. Louis). He played in nine games with the Amsterdam Admirals of the NFL Europe in 1995. He saw his first action in the NFL in 1996, playing in six games with the Rams.\nWashington.\nMartin spent 1997 as third-string quarterback for Washington Redskins of the NFL.\nFirst stint with Jaguars.\nAfter one season in Washington, Martin joined the Jacksonville Jaguars for the 1998 season. He played in four games with the Jaguars; his first pass attempt against Detroit went for a 67-yard touchdown. His first career start came December 13 against Tennessee, but an ACL injury in that game ended his season. He finished 1998 with 27 completions for 355 yards and two touchdowns; his final passer rating was 99.8 points.\nCleveland Browns.\nMartin joined the Cleveland Browns for the 1999 season, but spent most of the year on the inactive list.\nSecond stint with Jaguars.\nMartin re-joined the Jaguars in 2000, and saw limited action in five games.\nSecond stint with Rams.\nMartin had his second stint with the Rams from 2001 to 2002. He saw significant playing time in 2002 filling in for injured quarterback Marc Bulger. He played in 5 games, starting two of them, throwing for 1,216 yards with 7 touchdowns and 10 interceptions.\nNew York Jets.\nMartin spent 2003 with the New York Jets, but did not appear in a game for them.\nThird stint with Rams.\nMartin joined the Rams for the third time in 2004 and spent two seasons with the team.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nMartin joined the Saints in 2006 and served as a backup to Drew Brees for two seasons.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nOn September 10, 2008, Martin was signed by the San Francisco 49ers after quarterback Alex Smith was placed on injured reserve. The move reunited Martin with 49ers offensive coordinator and former Rams head coach Mike Martz.\nPost-football career.\nOn April 4, 2012, Martin, a drum player, founded Explode the Moon, an electric rock band that does cover songs. He is also the offensive coordinator for Parkway West High School in Ballwin, Missouri.

        "text": "Gary C. Clark (born May 1, 1962) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) for the Washington Redskins (1985–92), Phoenix/Arizona Cardinals (1993–94), and Miami Dolphins (1995).\nEarly life.\nClark attended and played high school football for the Cougars football team at Pulaski County High School in Dublin, Virginia.\nCollege career.\nClark played college football at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia, where he caught 155 passes for 2,863 yards and 16 touchdowns. He also had three punt returns for touchdowns, including 89- and 87-yard returns in a game during the 1983 season against the University of Virginia. Clark was at James Madison during the Dukes' first four Division I-AA seasons. He caught 46 passes for James Madison's 8-3 team in 1982 and had 57 receptions in 1983. He was the Virginia offensive player of the year in 1982 and an honorable mention All-American in 1982 and 1983.\nClark became the first person in James Madison history to have his jersey retired.\nProfessional career.\nUSFL.\nClark was selected by the Jacksonville Bulls sixth overall in the 1984 USFL Draft. He led Jacksonville in receiving in his rookie season, in both receptions (56) and receiving yardage (760 yards). He played for the Bulls in 1984 and 1985.\nNFL.\nClark was selected by the Washington Redskins in the second round of the 1984 NFL Supplemental Draft of USFL and CFL Players.\nIn 1985, he signed with the Redskins and had a superb rookie season, recording 72 receptions for 926 yards and five touchdowns. Clark quickly established himself as one of the top receivers in the NFL. He followed up his superb rookie season in 1986 with a Pro Bowl year catching 74 passes for 1,265 yards and seven touchdowns. Clark set a Redskin record for receiving yards in a game during a Monday Night Football contest with the New York Giants. He caught 11 passes for 241 yards and a touchdown. The record still stands today as the \"most receiving yards in a non-strike game\" (Anthony Allen surpassed Clark's tally during the 1987 strike season). The Redskins went on to finish with a 12-4 record and defeated the reigning Super Bowl champion Chicago Bears, 27-13, in a divisional playoff game but lost to the Giants in the NFC Championship game, 17-0.\nIn 1987, Clark again had a Pro Bowl year, catching 56 passes for 1,066 and seven touchdowns. He achieved these numbers in only 12 games, as a player strike shortened the season by one game and replacements played three games. No Redskin player crossed the picket line and the replacements went 3-0. Clark was only one of four NFL receivers to surpass 1,000 yards. By this time, he had caught the eye of CBS commentator John Madden. Clark's toughness, big-play ability and willingness to block made him a regular on the All Madden Team during his playing career. The Redskins went on to finish 11-4, winning the NFC East crown. In the playoffs, the Redskins defeated the Chicago Bears in the Divisional Playoff game for the second year in a row, 21-17. Clark caught three passes for 57 yards and a touchdown in the NFC Championship game against the Minnesota Vikings. The Redskins won, 17-10, to earn the right to play in Super Bowl XXII. Clark caught three passes for 55 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 25 yards in Washington's 42-10 rout of John Elway and the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXII.\nClark's numbers dropped in 1988 as he caught 59 passes for 892 yards and seven touchdowns. The Redskins finished a paltry 7-9 and missed the playoffs. He returned to form in 1989, catching 79 passes (a career-high) for 1,229 yards and nine touchdowns. The Redskins finished 10-6 but missed the playoffs again because of a 5-6 start. Clark, along with fellow receivers Art Monk and Ricky Sanders, surpassed the 1,000 yard mark in 1989. This was the second time in NFL History that three receivers from one team all went over the 1,000 yard mark in the same year.\nIn 1990, Clark had another Pro Bowl year and the Redskins made the playoffs. He caught 75 passes for 1,112 yards and eight touchdowns. The Redskins went on to beat the Philadelphia Eagles, 20-6, in an NFC Wild Card game. Clark caught four passes for 63 yards and a touchdown. The Redskins lost the next week to the San Francisco 49ers, 28-10.\nIn 1991, Clark and the Redskins tore through the NFL. He caught 70 passes for 1,340 yards and ten touchdowns. His 19.1 yards per catch was second in the NFL. Clark caught four passes for 203 yards and three touchdowns in Washington's 56-17 rout of the Atlanta Falcons in week 11. The Redskins finished 14-2, won the NFC East, and claimed home field advantage throughout the playoffs. Washington beat Atlanta, 24-7, and crushed Detroit, 41-10, to earn a berth in Super Bowl XXVI against the Buffalo Bills. Clark had a big day with seven catches for 114 yards and a touchdown in Washington's 37-24 defeat of the Bills. The Redskins led 24-0 early in the third quarter, but Buffalo cut the lead to 24-10. His 30-yard touchdown reception in the third quarter was instrumental in thwarting a comeback attempt by the Bills.\nClark, Monk, and Sanders gave the Redskins one of the best receiving corps in the NFL during the late 1980s and early 1990s. They were known as The Posse. Clark was long known as the most fiery spirit of the bunch, and he was known to run laps around RFK Stadium after touchdowns and during Redskins comebacks. Clark signed with the Phoenix Cardinals as a free agent prior to the 1993 season, and the Redskins have only made the playoffs five times since, as of the end of the 2020 season.\nClark retired from the NFL after the 1995 season. In his 11 NFL seasons, he caught 699 passes for 10,856 yards and 65 touchdowns, while rushing for 54 yards and gaining 62 yards on nine punt returns. He also had twenty-seven 100-yard games wearing the Redskins uniform. Clark was a four-time Pro Bowl selection in 1986, 1987, 1990, and 1991. He was also a three-time All-Pro selection. He led his team in receiving seven times (1986, 1987, 1989–1992, 1994), and won two Super Bowls, Super Bowl XXII and Super Bowl XXVI, during his NFL career.\nClark was the first wide receiver in NFL history to catch at least 50 passes in his first ten NFL seasons. As of , the only other players to do so have been Marvin Harrison, Torry Holt and Larry Fitzgerald. Despite this, Clark was never considered as a finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, much less even make it as a semifinalist despite being one of few receivers to record 10,000 receiving yards in the pre-salary cap era of the NFL while recording 65 touchdown receptions as one of the key receivers on the Redskins along with Art Monk.\nNotes.\nClark was the owner of the now closed South Beach Restaurant and Martini Lounge in Bethesda, Maryland.\nHe was inducted into the Redskins Ring of Honor on October 7, 2007 and concluded his speech with, \"We are going to spank Detroit's butt.\" The Redskins won the game, 34-3.\nIn 2007, he was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame."

        "title": "Mike Davis (basketball, born 1960)",
        "text": "Michael Davis (born September 15, 1960) is an American basketball coach. He was most recently the head men's basketball coach at the University of Detroit Mercy, a position he held from 2018 to 2024. Davis also served as the head men's basketball coach at Indiana University Bloomington from 2000 to 2006, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) from 2006 to 2012, and Texas Southern University from 2012 to 2018.\nPlaying career.\nDavis, an Alabama native, spent his collegiate playing career with the University of Alabama Crimson Tide after earning the state's Mr. Basketball honor in 1979. In his first season, he played for the legendary C. M. Newton and then spent his final three years playing under another coaching legend, Wimp Sanderson. He ended his career with a 10.1 points per game average. His 165 steals ranks third all-time at the school. Davis won the team's Hustle Award all four seasons and was named to the Southeastern Conference's All-Defensive team his senior year.\nFollowing his playing career at Alabama, Davis was a second-round selection of the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association in the 1983 draft, but never played in the league. He would spend the next two seasons playing in Switzerland, where he and teammate Ron Burns were named to the league's all-star team, and in Italy. He played the 1988–89 season with the Topeka Sizzlers of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA).\nCoaching career.\nDavis began his coaching career as an assistant at Miles College in Fairfield, Alabama. After one season at Miles College, Davis relocated to Venezuela, directing both professional teams and the country's national team.\nIn 1990, Davis returned to the United States and took a position with the Wichita Falls Texans of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA). He made brief appearances as a player from 1990 to 1992, totalling 63 minutes in 5 games. Davis played in 18 games during the 1993–94 season and averaged 5.0 points per game. In 1994, the Wichita Falls franchise relocated to Chicago, Illinois, and became the Chicago Rockers. Davis played in 56 games for the Rockers during the 1994–95 season and averaged 8.3 points per game.\nAlabama.\nDavis returned to his alma mater Alabama and served as an assistant coach from 1995 to 1997 under head coach David Hobbs.\nIndiana.\nAssistant coach.\nIn 1997, Davis joined the coaching staff of legendary coach Bob Knight at Indiana University. In his three seasons as an IU assistant, the Hoosiers compiled a 63–32 overall record and advanced to the NCAA Tournament three times.\nHead coach.\nIndiana University president Myles Brand dismissed Bob Knight in September 2000, finding him in violation of a \"zero tolerance\" policy Brand had previously instituted. Students and alumni protested the Knight firing, and several players threatened to transfer unless assistants John Treloar and Mike Davis were promoted to replace Knight. Brand offered the assistants jobs as 'co coaches' but Treloar declined, deferring to Davis. As such, Davis was named as interim coach on September 12, 2000. Treloar accepted the title of 'Associate Head Coach.'\nIn his first season, Davis led a team featuring NBA draft picks Kirk Haston and Jared Jeffries to a 21–13 record. On March 21, 2001, Davis was formally named as Indiana's 22nd full-time head coach and the Hoosiers' first African–American head coach. In 2002, the Davis-led Hoosiers followed a 19–11 regular season with a surprise run to the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament title game. One month later, Indiana rewarded Davis with a contract extension through the 2007–08 season.\nCoach Davis was unable to maintain similar success in the following years. In a game on December 21, 2002, 6th ranked Indiana took on 16th ranked Kentucky. Prior to the game Davis stated publicly that he \"hated Kentucky with a passion\" and wanted to win the game \"in the worst way.\" During the game Davis, enraged by a foul not being called, ran onto the court with 2.6 seconds remaining. Davis was subsequently ejected. Indiana trailed only 65–64 when Davis exploded, but Kentucky's Keith Bogans made five of the six ensuing free throws to put the game out of reach and Kentucky went on to win the game 70–64. In a press conference following the game, Mike Davis said, \"There's no way I should've acted like that. I can't explain it. I've done something to embarrass my team. ... I cost us the game. I was so emotional. I need to learn and grow from this.\"\nThe following season, in 2003–04, Indiana's 14–15 record was the school's first losing season in over 35 years. In 2004 'Associate Head Coach' John Treloar left Indiana for a position as an assistant coach at LSU. The following season, Indiana went 15–14, including a first round home loss in the NIT. In the spring of 2005, Athletic Director Rick Greenspan warned,\nWhile we share this common goal and are both confident that it will be reached, we also know that our record the last two years is not up to the standards to which Indiana is accustomed and to which we aspire. This is why we have set ambitious and achievable goals for next season of competing at a very high level in the Big Ten Conference and successfully competing in the NCAA tournament.\nIndiana again failed to meet expectations during the 2005–06 season. By late January 2006, the Hoosiers were at risk of missing the tournament for the third straight year and the calls for Davis' job grew louder. On February 11, 2006, Davis missed a home game against Iowa. Four days later, he resigned effective at the end of the 2006 season. Davis said that he decided to make the announcement before the end of the season to end the distraction that his position's uncertainty had created around the team. The Hoosiers performed better after this announcement and reached the second round of the NCAA Tournament. Indiana lost 90–80 to Gonzaga in the NCAA Tournament on March 18, 2006, ending Mike Davis' tenure as Indiana's head coach.\nIn 2018 Davis admitted that he was not ready to be a head coach at such a large school when he took over for Knight. Speaking on the Big Ten Network’s 'A Taste of Coaching,' Davis said, \"I wasn't prepared, I knew I wasn't prepared, but I tried to walk out like I was prepared.\" Davis also said in 2018 that he was now '100 times better' as a coach than he was at Indiana due to his increased coaching experience.\nUAB.\nOn April 7, 2006, Davis was hired as the new head coach of the UAB Blazers. Davis replaced Mike Anderson, who left UAB after a successful stint to become the head coach at Missouri. The Blazers finished 15–16 in Davis' first season at the helm, earning a 9th seed in the Conference USA tournament and losing to 8th seed Marshall 53–52 in the first round. UAB subsequently failed to qualify for the NCAA men's basketball tournament, ending the Blazers' three-year streak of appearances in the NCAA post-season and causing some to question whether Davis was the right man for the job.\nDespite several injuries and academic casualties in Davis's second year at UAB, Davis led the Blazers to a 22–9 regular season record and a 2nd-place finish in Conference USA. The Blazers narrowly missed making the NCAA men's basketball tournament and instead were rewarded with an appearance in the NIT.\nOn April 24, 2007, the University Board of Trustees rewarded Davis with a 2-year contract extension. The extended contract ran through and the 2012–13 season featured a base salary that was increased to $625,000 from $600,000 annually. He was also eligible for increased incentives, including $35,000 for taking UAB to the NCAA Tournament, $75,000 each for a Sweet 16 appearance and a Final Four appearance and $100,000 for appearing in the national championship game. The buyout clause in the contract was increased from $500,000 to $625,000. This contract is fully guaranteed. On March 16, 2012, after a 15–16 record (9–7 in Conference USA) Davis was fired as the head basketball coach at UAB due to \"poor ticket sales and attendance\" as well as waning fan support and a history of disappointing performances in postseason action.\nTexas Southern.\nOn August 2, 2012, Davis was named interim head coach of Texas Southern University after the abrupt resignation of Tony Harvey.

        "text": "The 2010 Asian Games (), officially known as the XVI Asian Games () and also known as Guangzhou 2010 (), were a regional multi-sport event that had taken place from November 12 to 27, 2010 in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (although several events commenced earlier on November 7, 2010). It was the second time China hosted the Asian Games, with the first one being Asian Games 1990 in Beijing.\nGuangzhou's three neighboring cities, Dongguan, Foshan and Shanwei co-hosted the Games. Premier Wen Jiabao opened the Games along the Pearl River in Haixinsha Island. A total of 53 venues were used to host the events. The design concept of the official logo of the 2010 Asian Games was based on the legend of the Guangzhou's Five Goats, representing the Five Goats as the Asian Games Torch.\nA total of 9,704 athletes from 45 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) competed in 476 events of 42 sports and disciplines (28 Olympic sports and 14 non-Olympic sports), making it the largest event in the history of the Games. Due to reductions in the number of sports for competition in the 2014 Asian Games, these Games marked the final time that six non-Olympic events would be held during the Asian Games.\nChina led the final medal tally, followed by South Korea in second place, and Japan in third place. China set a new Games record with 199 gold medals. China became the first nation in the history of Asian Games to cross the 400 medal-mark in one edition. Three world and 103 Asian records were broken. Macau and Bangladesh won their first ever Asian Games gold medals. In addition, the badminton men's singles gold medalist Lin Dan was voted as the most valuable player (MVP). The President of the Olympic Council of Asia Sheikh Ahmed Al-Fahad Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah hailed the Games as \"outstanding\" and \"one of the best ever.\"\nBidding process.\nSeoul and Amman dropped out before their bids were officially selected by the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA), leaving only two candidate cities—Guangzhou and Kuala Lumpur—by March 31, 2004. Seoul withdrew after considering that South Korea hosted the 2002 Games in Busan only eight years earlier. The evaluation committee of the OCA inspected Kuala Lumpur from April 12 to 14 and Guangzhou from April 14 to 16, 2004. On April 15, 2004, the Government of Malaysia declared that it would not support the Olympic Council of Malaysia with a Kuala Lumpur bid due to the high cost of hosting the Games, estimated at US$366 million, forcing Kuala Lumpur to withdraw its bid and leaving Guangzhou as the sole bidder. The OCA unanimously selected Guangzhou to host the 2010 Games during their 23rd General Assembly session in Doha, Qatar, site of the 2006 Asian Games, on July 1, 2004.\nDevelopment and preparations.\nCosts.\nOn March 11, 2005, Lin Shusen, then party secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) said the Games \"will not cost more than ¥2 billion\",\nin stark contrast to an earlier report, which had claimed that the cost could exceed ¥200 billion.\nIn March 2009, the director of the marketing department of the Games, Fang Da'er, claimed that the Games were short of funds, due to the lack of sponsorship and the global financial crisis. An informal estimate put the Games' expenditure at about US$420 million and revenue at US$450 million.\nOn October 13, 2010, Wan Qingliang, mayor of Guangzhou at the time, officially revealed in a press conference that the total cost of staging the Asian Games and Asian Para Games was about ¥122.6 billion ($18.37 billion), with ¥109 billion spent on the city's infrastructure, ¥6.3 billion on the venues and some ¥7.3 billion spent on the Games' operations.\nThe full spending details would be released before 2013, according to the city's finance chief Zhang Jieming. It was later reported that Guangzhou accumulated US$32 billion (¥210 billion) in debt after staging the Games.\nVolunteers.\nThe volunteer recruitment program for the 2010 Asian Games began at 9 pm on April 21, 2009, with a target of 60,000 games-time volunteers. The volunteers were given a green short-sleeve t-shirt, a green long-sleeve t-shirt, a sport jacket, a pair of trousers, a hat, a water bottle, a pair of sport shoes and a waist bag.\nTorch relay.\nTwo torch designs were shortlisted in September 2009 for the 2010 Asian Games. The organizers chose a design named \"The Tide\" over one named \"Exploit\" as the torch of the Games. \"The Tide\" weighed 98 g and was 70 cm long. It was tall and straight in shape, while dynamic in terms of image.\nThe torch relay route was unveiled on March 4, 2010, and due to budgetary issues and the problems related to 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay, the organizers decided to carry it out on a smaller scale than those carried out previously. The torch was lit at the Great Wall of China on October 9, 2010, and traveled around the Temple of Heaven in Beijing. As originally scheduled, 21 cities were present on the relay route, with 2,010 torchbearers expected to carry it from October 12 to November 12, 2010. Two more cities — Changchun in Jilin and Haiyang in Shandong, the host cities of 2007 Asian Winter Games and 2012 Asian Beach Games respectively, were also later added to the route for a single day on October 15, 2010, increasing the number of torchbearers to 2,068 people.\nMarketing.\nEmblem.\nThe official emblem of the Games was unveiled at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall on November 26, 2006, to prepare the city to succeed Doha 2006 as Asian Games host city. It was a stylized representation of Guangzhou's \"Statue of the Five Goats\" () fused with a running track. In Chinese tradition, the goat is a blessing and brings people luck, and the host city Guangzhou is known as the \"City of Goats\". The orange and yellow emblem also resembles a flame.\nMascots.\nThe mascots of the Games were five goat rams. They were unveiled on April 28, 2008, at the Guangzhou Baiyun International Convention and Exhibition Center. The five goat rams, four small and one large, were named A Xiang (), A He (), A Ru (), A Yi () and Le Yangyang (). The Chinese character \"yang\" (羊) or \"goat\" is an auspicious symbol.

The theme of the design was the \"Maritime Silk Road.\" They featured the Emblem of the Olympic Council of Asia and Guangzhou's kapok flower on the obverse and the Maritime Silk Road image and the games' logo on the reverse. The Maritime Silk Road image depicts a Chinese boat sailing on the sea, representing Guangzhou as the starting place of Maritime Silk Road, as the most important commercial center and entrepot of the Southern China, Hong Kong and Macau regions.\nMotto.\nThe official motto of the 2010 Asian Games was \"Thrilling Games, Harmonious Asia\" (). It was chosen to represent the goal of the Asian Games which is based on Olympic ideals and values. The Games aimed to create a competitive atmosphere for participating athletes while promoting unity, peace and friendship among Asian people regardless of differences in race, nationality, religious beliefs and language.\nPromotion.\nTwo years before the games, the \"Road of Asia\" tour was launched at Tianhe Sports Center to promote the games throughout the region. A ceremony was held on November 12, 2009, at the Guangzhou Gymnasium to mark the one-year milestone before the Games.\nMerchandising.\nOrganizers started selling licensed Asian Games products with introduction of first batch in January 2008. On May 7, 2009, the Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper signed a contract with the Guangzhou Asian Games Organizing Committee (GAGOC) and became the exclusive online retailer of licensed products.\nMusic.\nThe official theme song was released on September 30, 2010, and was called \"Reunion\" (). It was composed by Wu Liqun, with lyrics written by Xu Rongkai. The English version was translated by Chen Ning Yang, a Chinese-American physicist, and his wife, Weng Fan. The song was performed by Sun Nan and the late Yao Beina. Sun Nan also performed it again with Mao Amin for a music video. The song was selected based from a solicitation campaign for Asian Games songs which received more than 1,600 entries. 36 of them were released as selected songs for the Games.\nVenues.\nA total of 53 competition venues and 17 training venues were used for the Games, with four venues located outside of Guangzhou. Events took place at 42 pre-existing venues; eleven competition venues and one training venue were constructed for the Games, while the rest were renovated. Other venues included the Asian Games Town, which consisted of the Games Village with the Athletes, Officials and Media Buildings, the Main Media Center and the International Broadcast Center.\nOrganizers revealed that the total investment was over ¥15 billion.\nOn April 19, 2009, organizers announced that they had chosen Haixinsha Island on the Pearl River as the venues for the opening and closing ceremonies.

Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport was upgraded, in contracted with Crisplant (formerly FKI Logistex), to support massive volume of passengers. A new Wuhan–Guangzhou High-Speed Railway was opened on December 26, 2009, to shorten the travel time between two destinations.\nIn order to ease traffic congestion and air pollution, the government ordered a 40% reduction of vehicles and offered 1,000 buses for use during the Games and Para Games. The government also had a free-ride offer for public transportation during the month of Games, but it was cancelled one week prior to the Games due to an overwhelming response from the citizens. Instead, the government offered ¥150 () cash subsidies to each household with permanent residence for commuting purposes.\nThe Games.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony was held on November 12, 2010. For the first time in Asian Games history, the ceremony was not held in a traditional stadium setting.

The host nation, China, is highlighted.\nBroadcasting.\nGuangzhou Asian Games Broadcasting Co., Ltd (GAB) (), a broadcasting consortium established on December 31, 2008, served as the host broadcaster of the games. The International Broadcast Centre was constructed within the Asian Games town.\nConcerns and controversies.\nSports.\nCricket was among the five debut sports in the Games. India, despite its historical record, decided not to send its cricket team to the Games. According to the Board of Control for Cricket in India, the decision was due to other international commitments. However, its main rivals, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, confirmed their participation.\nIn ten-pin bowling, the Asian Bowling Federation decided to hold matches without spectators, this resulted in protests from many delegates.\nOn November 17, Yang Shu-chun of Chinese Taipei was abruptly disqualified with 12 seconds left in the first round of the taekwondo competition, while leading her opponent 9–0. She was accused of having installed illegal sensors on the heel of her socks. The event quickly turned into an international incident, with officials, politicians and fans from Chinese Taipei, China and South Korea trading accusations of manipulation and fraud.\nAbout 1,400 random doping tests were carried out during the Games. Two athletes tested positive; judoka Shokir Muminov on November 19, 2010, and Greco-Roman wrestler Jakhongir Muminov on November 24, 2010, both from Uzbekistan, tested positive for methylhexanamine. On January 24, 2011, the OCA announced another two doping failures, Qatari Ahmed Dheeb who tested positive for exogenous testosterone metabolites and Palestinian Awajna Abdalnasser who tested positive for 19-Norandrosterone.\nLanguages.\nIn July 2010, the citizens of Guangzhou opposed the proposal suggested by the city committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) to use Mandarin more in television news programs, rather than Guangzhou's main language, Cantonese. The debates eventually led to a series of public protests.\nIn late October 2010, in order to protest over the government's language policy in Tibetan areas, the Tibetan Youth Congress (TYC) used the Games as a channel to voice their concerns.\nEnvironment.\nLike the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, Guangzhou also attempted to improve the city's air quality. The authority pledged ¥600 million to fight the problem and ordered around 32 chemical plants to stop production by the end of 2009. A report from July 13, 2010, indicated that the air quality was rated at 95.07% in 2009, an increase of 12.01% since 2004; this improvement eventually cost authorities ¥24 billion. Subsequent action from organizers to curb pollution included decreasing the movement of vehicles up to 40% and banning barbecue stalls in 11 cities.\nBetween 2005 and 2008 about 150 Guolang villagers survived by growing tomatoes, beans, and cabbages while fighting the government for fairer compensation after their homes were flattened for Asian Games infrastructure. The Panyu government set aside a date to listen to petitioners' complaint on October 18, 2010.\nPrior to the opening of the games, Conghua reported 429 cases of norovirus outbreak. The government officials stressed that the people affected recovered before November 12."

        "text": "The 2014 Asian Games (), officially known as the 17th Asian Games () and also known as Incheon 2014 (), was a pan-Asian multi-sport event held in Incheon, South Korea. \nOn 17 April 2007 Incheon was awarded the right to host the games, defeating Delhi, India and was the third city in South Korea after Seoul (1986) and Busan (2002). The games were held from 19 September to 4 October 2014, although several pre-competitive events began between 14 and 19 September 2014. Approximately 9,501 athletes participated in the event which featured 439 events in 36 sports. It was opened by the President of South Korea, Park Geun-hye at the Incheon Asiad Main Stadium.\nThe final medal tally was led by China, followed by the host South Korea and Japan, while Cambodia won its first-ever Asian Games gold medal. During the games, 14 world and 27 Asian records were broken. Japanese swimmer Kosuke Hagino was announced as the most valuable player (MVP) of the Games. Though there were several controversies, the Games were deemed generally successful with their low hosting cost and with the rising standard of competition amongst the Asian nations.\nBidding process.\nNew Delhi and Incheon submitted their formal bid by the official deadline, 30 June 2005. A 5-member evaluation committee of the Olympic Council of Asia, headed by then vice-president of the association Celso Dayrit inspected New Delhi from 9 to 11 November 2006 and Incheon from 12 to 14 November 2006.\nThe vote was held on 17 April 2007 in Kuwait City, Kuwait during the 26th Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) General Assembly. During the final presentation before voting, Incheon made a new offer, raising US$20 million in funds to support countries that had yet to win a medal in the Games. It also offered free flight tickets and accommodation to all participants; India, however, made no changes to its offer. All 45 members voted, with voting held in secret ballot. Later that day, it was announced that Incheon won the rights. Though the vote results were not released, it was revealed that Incheon won by 32 to 13.\nIt was widely felt that Delhi's lack of enthusiasm to host the event was the primary reason for its loss. Then Union Sports Minister of India, Mani Shankar Aiyar, spoke strongly against Delhi hosting the games, arguing that the money allocated by India's government to the sporting event would be better spent on building facilities for the poor. The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president revealed that India's Sports Minister's remarks against hosting the Games was the main reason for New Delhi's loss. The IOA delegation added that the evaluation committee was concerned about pollution and traffic in Delhi. Delhi's offer of US$2 million to each team for games support against Incheon's offer of US$20 million to all 45 nations participating in the event could also have contributed to the defeat. Unlike Delhi, Incheon emphasized the high-tech facilities that would be available to the athletes.\nDevelopment and preparations.\nCosts.\nThe cost of the Games was estimated at approximately US$1.62 billion, with the Korean government and Incheon government covering 19% and 78.9% respectively. Of the total budget, some US$1.39 billion was used for construction of venues and infrastructure, while approximately US$11 million covered the building and maintenance of training grounds. Around US$103 million was allocated for road and transportation projects.\nA report in April 2012, however, suggested the city was under financial pressure from increasing debt.\nThe Incheon Asian Games Organising Committee (IAGOC) saved US$34 million after agreeing to reduce from 15,000 to 2,025 athletes to be provided free transportation and accommodation.\nVolunteers.\nThe volunteer program of Incheon 2014 Asian Games began on 1 November 2013 with a target to recruit 13,500 volunteers. As of 16 March 2014, 25,827 applications were received and 21,237 applicants were selected for training.\nTorch relay.\nThe torch was revealed in October 2013, with a design motif based on the Crane, the official bird of Incheon Metropolitan City. The torch's blue internal cylinder signified the sky and the ocean of Incheon. Another four colors (green, yellow, red, violet) were intended to represent the five regions of Asia.\nThe torch was lit at Dhyan Chand National Stadium in New Delhi, India on August 9, 2014. This marked the first time the torch had been lit outside the host country, and that Weihai, a city in Shandong Province of the People's Republic of China, had hosted the relay, on August 12, 2014.\nThe domestic lighting ceremony was held at Manisan on Ganghwa Island on August 12, 2014. The domestic relay begin August 13, 2014 and traveled through 70 cities for 5,700 km. to reach the opening ceremony.\nMarketing.\nEmblem.\nThe official emblem was also revealed on the lighting ceremony, representing a wing configuration of the letter \"A\", for \"Asia\", with a shining sun at its upper left, symbolizing the Asian people holding hands in the sky.\nMascot.\nOn November 4, 2010, three Spotted seal siblings were unveiled as the official mascots of the Games in Songdo Island, Incheon. The three seals, known as \"Barame (바라메)\", \"Chumuro (추므로)\" and \"Vichuon (비추온)\", meaning wind, dance and light in Korean, were chosen under the theme of the main venue. The prototype was taken from Baengnyeongdo. According to the organizers, the mascots were chosen to symbolise the future peace between South Korea and North Korea. Vichuon is the eldest of the three siblings, Barame is the second eldest, while Chumuro is the youngest and the only girl among the three siblings.\nMedals.\nThe medal design was approved by OCA on August 19, 2013. It features a pentagon-shaped symbol representing the five ports of Incheon — Airport, Seaport, Teleport, Leisureport, and Businessport, with the emblem of the Games inside. It symbolises the city as the hub of Northeast Asia.\nMotto.\nUnveiled on September 16, 2010, \"Diversity Shines Here\" was the official English motto of the Games, celebrating the significance of Asia's wonderful diversity in history, cultures, and religions. The official slogan in Korean, \"\" (RR: ), literally means \"Breath of Peace, Future of Asia\".\nPromotion.\nThe six official posters for the Incheon Asian Games were released on March 31, 2011. The design represents the 28 Olympic sports categorized into five groups: racquet sports, ball sports, water sports, athletic sports and weight class. In various ways, the values and philosophy of the 17th Asian Games is represented in these posters.\nMerchandising.\nOrganisers began selling merchandise in July 2012. IB Worldwide was the exclusive online merchandiser of the event's licensed products.\nMusic.\nThe official album was released by Universal Music on June 20, 2014, which featured \"Only One\", performed by JYJ as the Games' official theme song.\nVenues.\nThe Games had 49 competition venues and 48 training facilities. Among the competition venues, ten were in six cities of Gyeonggi Province while another two were in Chungju and Seoul. The rest of the venues were in eight districts and a county inside metropolitan Incheon. Ten venues were constructed for the Games. The Games also provided over 3,300 units and 9,560 rooms for athletes and media personnel.\nThe main stadium, known as Incheon Asiad Main Stadium, had a seating capacity of 61,074 seats, with 30,000 seats variable after the Games. The US$400 million stadium, originally planned for 70,000 seats, was designed by Populous, which had designed several event venues around the world, including the Olympic Stadium of the 2012 Summer Olympics. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on June 28, 2011 in Yeonhui-dong. Construction began in June 2011 and finished in July 2014.\nAn athletes' village was built at Guwol, Namdong District, which had 2,220 units in 22 apartment buildings to accommodate around 14,500 athletes and officials.\nTransport.\nIncheon Subway's construction period was shortened from a planned 2018 completion. Due to the increasing popularity of Incheon International Airport during the Games, immigration procedures were improved for passenger convenience.\nThe Games.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony began on September 19, 2014 at 18:00 local time. The performance was directed by film director Im Kwon-taek with playwright and actor Jang Jin, entertainer Kim Seong-ju and KBS host Yun Su-yeong as voiceovers of the ceremony. It was attended by President of South Korea Park Geun-hye who opened the games, President of International Olympic Committee Thomas Bach, Tokyo Governor Yōichi Masuzoe and also Incheon Mayor Yoo Jeong-bok.\nActors Jang Dong-gun and Kim Soo-hyun led the performance, consisting of four acts: \"Asia long time ago\", \"Asia meeting through the sea\", \"Asia as family and friends\", and \"Asia as one and future joining with today\", displaying the Korean past and future with digital technology. Other performers included Chinese pianist Lang Lang, the soprano diva Sumi Jo, along the k-pop stars JYJ, Exo, and Psy, who wrapped up the ceremony with a performance of his world hit song Gangnam Style.\nUnlike in the 2002 Asian Games opening ceremony, South Korea as host marched separately from neighbor North Korea in the parade of nations.\nSports.\nThe 2014 Asian Games featured 28 Olympic sports that would be contested at the 2016 Summer Olympics. In addition, eight non-Olympic sports were featured: baseball, ten-pin bowling, cricket, kabaddi, karate, sepak takraw, squash and wushu. The list was finalised on December 9, 2010 at the OCA's executive board meeting in Muscat, Oman. This resulted in dropping six other sports: roller sport, board games (chess, go, xiangqi), cue sports, softball, dancesport and dragon boat, which had been held in previous Games being dropped from the list. The list was approved on July 13, 2011 during the 30th annual general assembly in Tokyo as softball was incorporated with baseball as one sport while soft tennis came under the discipline of tennis. For the first time compound archery, mixed relay triathlon, and judo team events were introduced.\nChanges to the non-Olympic sports featured at the Asian Games were influenced by discussions with organizers, who suggested cricket's removal from the program, as they felt too few countries played it and that they lacked the infrastructure to host it. The OCA disputed the proposed removal of cricket, however, noting its popularity and viewer interest.\nParticipating National Olympic Committees.\nAll 45 members of the Olympic Council of Asia participated, including North Korea, which initially threatened to boycott the Games after disputes with South Korea over administrative issues about its delegation of athletes and officials. Saudi Arabia was the sole NOC to not send female athletes to the Games.\nBelow is a list of all the participating NOCs; the number of competitors per delegation is indicated in brackets.\nCalendar.\nIn the following calendar for the 2014 Asian Games, each blue box represents an event competition, such as a qualification round, on that day. The yellow boxes represent days during which medal-awarding finals for a sport were held, which numeric representing the number of finals that were contested on that day. On the left, the calendar lists each sport with events held during the Games, and at the right how many gold medals were won in that sport. There is a key at the top of the calendar to aid the reader.\nClosing ceremony.\nThe closing ceremony was held on October 4, 2014 at 7:00 p.m. local time. The ceremony's theme was \"Our Cherished Memories of Incheon\". OCA President Sheikh Ahmad Al Fahad Al Sabah, Prime Minister of South Korea Jung Hong-won, and Mayor of Incheon Yoo Jeong-bok were guests at the ceremony. The events featured the performances of National Dance Company of Korea, Gugak Center Dance Troupe and Kukkiwon. Soprano Im Sun-hae then sang the national anthem , whereupon the athletes entered the stadium with volunteers and placard bearers. CNBLUE performed \"I'm Sorry\" and \"Can't Stop\" before Sheikh Ahmad Al Fahad Al Sabah presented the Japaneses Kosuke Hagino the Samsung MVP award and declared the Incheon 2014 Asian Games closed.\nThe OCA Flag was lowered and the flag of Indonesia, the next games' host nation, was raised as the Indonesian national anthem was played. IOC member Rita Subowo, Governor of South Sumatra Alex Noerdin, and the Governor of Jakarta Basuki Tjahaja Purnama received the Games flag for the 2018 Games. The ceremony proceeded with a small scale segment from the next Asian Games host cities, Jakarta and Palembang. It began with \"\"The Colours of Jakarta\", featuring Ronggeng, a Javanese dance. This was followed by \"The Spirit of South Sumatra\"\", featured a Malay dance accompaniment of Rampak Nusantara drums.\nThe K-Pop stars Big Bang who performed their hit songs \"Hands up\" and \"Fantastic Baby\" wrapped up the closing ceremony, while Sistar performed during the pre-show concert.\nMedal table.\nChina led the medal table for the ninth consecutive time. Cambodia won their first Asian Games gold medal in taekwondo. A total of 37 NOCs won at least one medal, and 28 NOCs won at least one gold medal. Eight NOCs failed to win any medals at the Games.\nThe top ten ranked NOCs at these Games are listed below. The host nation, South Korea, is highlighted.\nBroadcasting.\nIncheon Asian Games Host Broadcasting Management (IHB) (), a joint venture between Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) and Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC), launched on 8 May 2013, served as the host broadcaster of the Games. The International Broadcasting Centre was constructed in Songdo Convensia in Yeonsu District.\nConcerns and controversies.\nBefore the Games, there were several controversies arose over finances, lack of public interest, transportation shortages for journalists, and several administrative decisions about the opening ceremony and gala show. Organizers were able to generate interest yet a few hundred empty seats remained in the 61,000-capacity stadium at the start of the opening ceremony. Organizers also supplied additional shuttle buses for the late-night shift personnel at the request of various international media organizations.\nThe OCA and FIBA also failed to compromise on a couple of policies, which caused one team to boycott the event and forced three teams to find replacement players. The Qatari women's basketball team withdrew from the Games when FIBA reaffirmed its ban on hijab, citing safety concerns. Basketball was the only sport to enforce a hijab ban in the Games. On the other hand, OCA policy on naturalised players contradicted the eligibility rules set by FIBA. The OCA disqualified United States-born players Quincy Davis, Andray Blatche, and Aaron Haynes from the Chinese Taipei, Filipino, and South Korean teams.\nSeveral controversies erupted during the Games, mostly surrounding poor officiating. The majority of poor judging allegations occurred in boxing, highlighted by the controversial semifinal loss of Indian lightweight boxer Laishram Sarita Devi against eventual silver medalist Park Jina of South Korea. The judging of the match, Sarita Devi's refusal to accept the bronze medal, and her questionable behavior at the medal ceremony received widespread international attention and sparked numerous debates. The high volume of controversial boxing decisions led to accusations of widespread incompetence and host favoritism against the judges. Criticisms of the new scoring system were also raised. Shooting, and wrestling saw initial rulings by officials being overturned upon appeals.\nSome 1,920 fluid samples from 1,600 athletes were tested during the Games. Six athletes tested positive for banned substances and were expelled from the Games, including two gold medalists who were stripped of their medals."

It is currently held at St Francis Links in St Francis Bay.\nHistory.\nThe current South African PGA Championship was founded in 1965, largely thanks to Gary Player and Brian Henning. The inaugural event was held in February 1965 and was won by Harold Henning who beat Player by 3 strokes.\nNew sponsors in 1972 gave the championship a home at The Wanderers Golf Club where it remained until 1995, when it became the first tournament in South Africa to be co-sanctioned by the European Tour. The following year Alfred Dunhill took over from Lexington as title sponsors, breaking a 23-year association with the PGA.\nFollowing the 1999 event, Dunhill decided to end their association with the South African PGA and create their own tournament, the Alfred Dunhill Championship, which also replaced the PGA Championship on the European calendar. As a result, there was no PGA Championship held in 2000, but the tournament returned to the Sunshine Tour the following year with a new sponsor. It is one of the richest sole-sanctioned events on the Sunshine Tour.\nThe South African PGA Championship, along with the South African Open and the South African Masters formed the Triple Crown of South African golf. Winning all three titles in the same season is a feat only achieved by Bobby Locke, Gary Player and Ernie Els."

        "title": "American football on Thanksgiving",
        "text": "American football is one of the many traditions in American culture that is associated with Thanksgiving Day. Virtually every level of football, from amateur and high school to college and the NFL (including the CFL on Canadian Thanksgiving), plays football on Thanksgiving Day (Thursday) or the immediately following holiday weekend (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday).\nEarly days.\nThanksgiving Day football games in the United States are nearly as old as the game—and the organized holiday—themselves. The first Thanksgiving Day football game took place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on Thanksgiving Day of 1869, less than two weeks after Rutgers defeated Princeton in New Brunswick, New Jersey in what is widely recognized as the first intercollegiate football game in the United States, and only six years after Abraham Lincoln declared the first fixed national Thanksgiving holiday in 1863. On November 17, 1869, the \"Evening Telegraph\" newspaper of Philadelphia published the following announcement: \"Foot Ball: A foot-ball match between twenty-two players of the Young America Cricket Club and the Germantown Cricket Club will take place on Thanksgiving Day at 12 1/2 o'clock, on the grounds of the Germantown Club.\" The proximity of Philadelphia to both Rutgers and Princeton invites speculation that this game may have been played under similar rules and perhaps involved some of the same participants, or at least people familiar with the game played at Rutgers, and a second match at Princeton, earlier that month.\nPrinceton played Yale in the New York City area on Thanksgiving Day from 1876 through 1881. The Thanksgiving Day football game became an institutionalized fixture of organized football in 1882, when the Intercollegiate Football Association determined to hold an annual collegiate championship game in New York City on Thanksgiving Day between the two leading teams in the association. Previously, the 'Champion' was to be determined by a team's records over the entire season against all members of the association. For at least the three previous years, the championship had been a matter of dispute as a result of Yale and Princeton playing to scoreless ties on three Thanksgiving Day games in a row.\nOn November 25, 1897, American students of the École des Beaux-Arts and the Académie Julian played a game in Paris, France. This is considered the first American football game ever played in Europe.\nThe tradition of playing football games on Thanksgiving continues to this day. At the high school level, the tradition is declining rapidly as schools drop their Thanksgiving games and shorten their regular season in favor of playoff tournaments and allowing players to focus on winter sports such as basketball.\nHigh school football.\nHigh school football games played on Thanksgiving are often called a Turkey Day Game or a Turkey Bowl (not to be confused with Turkey bowling), as Americans typically eat turkeys on Thanksgiving, although the title varies with each game. Most commonly these games are between high school football rivalries although in many cases, when poor weather requires a shorter season, the game can be the culmination of league play among a high-school league, in which the winners of this game will be the league champions for the year. (Statewide playoffs were generally rare until the 1970s and 1980s, which allowed for longer regular seasons.) The custom dates back more than 100 years and is particularly prevalent in the Northeast. In most cases, games are contested with kickoff times as early as 9 a.m., allowing the participants to have the rest of the holiday off.\nThis list is sorted alphabetically, first by state, and then by school, with team leading the series listed first wherever possible. State and regional championship tournaments are listed ahead of rivalries. If the rivalry involves two states, the rivalry is listed under the school whose state comes first alphabetically (e.g. a New Jersey-Pennsylvania rivalry is listed under New Jersey).\nConnecticut.\nConnecticut has at least 48 Thanksgiving games. Some of the better known ones are as follows:\nMaine.\nMaine has only one Thanksgiving football game\nMaryland.\nMaryland is home to one of the Oldest rivalries nationally, also known to be two of the oldest rivalries in the Southeastern United States.\nMassachusetts.\nIn Massachusetts, where high school football is not nearly the draw it is in other parts of the country, the Thanksgiving Day game is a long-standing tradition that brings out thousands of alumni and other fans. Virtually every school in the Bay State has a traditional rival and the holiday game is a focal point for all of them, no matter how unsuccessful the regular season may have been.\n\"Turkey Bowl\" games.\nUnorganized groups have also been known to partake in American football on Thanksgiving. These informal matches are usually known as a Turkey Bowl (not to be confused with some high school football games that also use the name \"Turkey Bowl\", see above, and with Turkey Bowling). These games are usually unofficiated with a flag football, street football, or touch football format.\nWhile the games themselves are not generally nationally known, Turkey Bowls hold importance for those who participate and it is not uncommon for rivalries to last for decades. Turkey Bowls are played by a variety of people including extended families, college fraternities, volunteer fire departments, and local churches across the country which use the day and the game to have fun, exercise and renew old acquaintances.\nCollege football.\nThanksgiving weekend historically marks the end of the college football regular season, before conference championships and bowl games begin play in December (the Army–Navy Game is the lone exception). Today, this is only true for the top-level NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, where it has become a tradition to play a fierce rival on the last week of the regular season. At levels below the Bowl Subdivision, the NCAA begins its championship tournaments either on Thanksgiving weekend (for the Division I FCS championship) or the week before (in the cases of Divisions II and III; the NAIA, a separate body, also begins its tournament at that time). Other college football sanctioning bodies end their seasons well before Thanksgiving.\nThe University of Kansas and University of Missouri played the first of nineteen consecutive Thanksgiving Day football games in Kansas City, Missouri in 1892. After new conference rules that required all games to be played on college campuses, the Thanksgiving Day tradition was temporarily suspended in 1911, but then reinstituted in spurts starting in 1916 and continuing through the 1940s.\nThe University of Michigan made it a tradition to play annual Thanksgiving games, holding 19 such games from 1885 to 1905. The Thanksgiving Day games between Michigan and the Chicago Maroons in the 1890s have been erroneously cited as \"The Beginning of Thanksgiving Day Football.\" Since the Maroons no longer play at the Division I level, the Wolverines now play their modern-day archrivals, the Ohio State Buckeyes, during Thanksgiving weekend. Yale and Princeton began an annual tradition of playing against each other on Thanksgiving Day starting in 1876. From 1945 to 1956, the Burley Bowl pitted two small colleges against each other in an unofficial bowl game.\nFrom 1894 to 1953, Case Tech Rough Riders and Western Reserve University Red Cats played each other on Thanksgiving, playing at Cleveland Stadium. The two schools merged in 1970.\nThe Turkey Day Classic, a college football game between Alabama State University and Tuskegee University, has been played on Thanksgiving Day annually from 1924 to 2012 and again since 2016; as such, it has historically been known as the \"Turkey Day Classic.\" It is also the oldest black college football classic, since the two colleges first played each other in 1901. Tuskegee University pulled out of the contest after 2012 (they were replaced by Stillman College in the 2013 contest), and Alabama State did the same from 2013 to 2015, deciding to move its homecoming to the Saturday before Thanksgiving; in both cases, the NCAA football tournaments prompted the schools to move the end of their seasons to before Thanksgiving so that they would be able to compete for the national championship should they qualify. The establishment of the Celebration Bowl for historically black schools allowed the Turkey Day Classic to resume; it was held against conference rivals Mississippi Valley State and Prairie View A&amp;M in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Another popular black college football classic played on Thanksgiving weekend is the Bayou Classic between Grambling State University and Southern University, which is held the Saturday after Thanksgiving; for the 2017 season only, because of a hurricane earlier in the season, the Labor Day Classic between Texas Southern and Prairie View A&amp;M was played on Thanksgiving weekend, and the two teams voluntarily agreed to hold that Classic on the same weekend in 2018. Alabama State, Mississippi Valley State, Prairie View A&amp;M, Texas Southern, Southern and Grambling are all members of the Southwestern Athletic Conference.\nOther prominent college football rivalries that take place over Thanksgiving weekend include:\nThe frequent changing of conferences stemming from the early-2010s realignment of NCAA teams and conferences complicated the numerous rivalries that traditionally play Thanksgiving weekend.\nWhile collegiate games have been played on Thanksgiving Day itself (with perhaps the most notable being the Nebraska-Oklahoma game of 1971), the majority of the current traditional Thanksgiving weekend college football games listed above are played on the Friday or Saturday after the holiday, in part to avoid conflicts with the NFL. Texas, as previously mentioned, has had more or less of a permanent spot on the night of the holiday itself since at least 2008.\nProfessional football.\nProfessional football teams and leagues have played on Thanksgiving from the start, with pro leagues and teams having played on Thanksgiving since the 1890s. It carried over when Buffalo and Rochester, two members of the New York Pro Football League (NYPFL) which had held its championship on Thanksgiving 1919, and the Ohio League, which traditionally held its marquee matchups on Thanksgiving, combined into the NFL upon its founding in 1920, and as such, the NFL has played on Thanksgiving ever since. The Detroit Lions and the Dallas Cowboys have played home games on Thanksgiving since 1934 and 1966, respectively, in a traditional series of NFL games. Beginning in 2006, the NFL added a third game on Thanksgiving night with a rotating host team.\nThe rival American Football League also played on Thanksgiving in the 1960s, as did the All-America Football Conference in the 1940s and the original AFL in 1926.\nIn the Canadian Football League, where games are played on Canadian Thanksgiving, the CFL hosts two games in the Thanksgiving Day Classic; it is one of only two weeks each year in which the CFL plays on a Monday, the other being the Labour Day Classic. The difference between the Thanksgiving and Labour Day games is that the Thanksgiving Day games do not have the same matchups each year; however, like its American counterpart, one of the games has a regular host (in the CFL's case, the Montreal Alouettes). Coincidentally, both the Grey Cup, the CFL's championship game, and the Vanier Cup, the championship of Canadian college football, are both traditionally played on the fourth weekend in November, which amounts to the week before or the week after American Thanksgiving.\nThe World Football League originally planned to hold its 1974 championship game, World Bowl 1, the day after Thanksgiving in 1974; the business failures of the 1974 season led to the league reorganizing the playoff structure and pushing the World Bowl one week back (although the WFL regularly played on Thursdays during the regular season, it instead split its semifinals between the day before Thanksgiving and the day after). Had the United States Football League completed its move to autumn for the 1986 season, it would have played one of its games on Thanksgiving (a game featuring the Tampa Bay Bandits at the Memphis Showboats was scheduled for that night), but the league suspended operations prior to the season and, even if it had survived, the Bandits went bankrupt before the season would have been played. Similarly, the United Football League, which began play in 2009, held its first two UFL Championship Games over Thanksgiving weekend; both the truncated 2011 UFL season and the 2012 UFL season were cut short well before the Thanksgiving holiday due to financial shortfalls. The Fall Experimental Football League had scheduled its championship for the day before Thanksgiving Day 2014, in Brooklyn, but the game was cancelled after the season was shortened."

        "text": "Indianwood Golf and Country Club or simply \"Indianwood\" is a private member-only country club located in Orion Township, Oakland County, near Lake Orion, Michigan. The club is approximately north of Detroit. \nHistory.\nThe \"Old Course\" was designed by Wilfrid Reid in 1925, the original club features a tower entrance, 18th century tapestries, leaded glass windows, and Knights in shining armor. The ballroom features a magnificent fireplace complete with an intricate shield carved from wood hanging over the mantel. According to historians, the club quickly became a haven for the wealthy of Detroit seeking to avoid the daily grind of the city. The club became very popular, hosting the Michigan Open in 1928, and even saw the construction of an airstrip. In 1930 the club hosted the Western Open, one of the most prestigious golf events of the time. In 1948 and 1949 it was site of the Michigan PGA Championship, won by Horton Smith and Chick Harbert, respectively.\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw Indianwood fall into decline. The bustling club fell into disrepair, with holes in the floors and beams hanging from the ceiling. In 1981, Detroit-area businessman Stan Aldridge purchased the building and surrounding land after being outbid for the Detroit Red Wings by Mike Ilitch. Aldridge, a non-golfer, saw the club as an investment and sought to restore the club to its former glory. Two of Aldridge's uncles were members of the club in the 1950s, and he we could accompany them to Sunday brunches. The original buildings and barns were restored, and the clubhouse and locker room addition was completed in 1989. Eventually a \"New Course\" for golf would be added to the original in 1988.\nIn 1989, the re-established club hosted its largest event, the 1989 U.S. Women's Open won by Betsy King. It would host the event again 5 years later in 1994, which was won by Patty Sheehan. It hosted the U.S. Senior Open in 2012, won by Roger Chapman.\nManagement.\nStan Aldridge and his children are still connected to the club through day-to-day operations, new construction, and design. Son Keith Aldridge, a former professional hockey player, serves as the club's Vice President and General Manager.\nFor his work with Indianwood and other courses in the state, Stan Aldridge was elected to the Michigan Golf Hall of Fame in 2005."

        "title": "Eddie Robinson (baseball)",
        "text": "William Edward Robinson (December 15, 1920 – October 4, 2021) was an American Major League Baseball first baseman, scout, coach, and front office executive of the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s who, during a 13-year playing career (1942; 1946–57), was on the roster of seven of the eight American League teams then in existence (with the Red Sox as the sole exception). He was the author of an autobiography, published in 2011, titled \"Lucky Me: My Sixty-five Years in Baseball\".\nRobinson was the last surviving member of the 1943 \"Navy World Series\", the last surviving member of a World Series-winning Cleveland Indians team, and the last surviving major leaguer to have played at League Park in Cleveland, which the Indians abandoned after the 1946 season. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living player from a World Series-winning team and the oldest living member of the Baltimore Orioles, Cleveland Indians, Chicago White Sox, Detroit Tigers, New York Yankees, Philadelphia / Kansas City Athletics, and Washington Senators. Following the death of Val Heim on November 21, 2019, Robinson became the oldest living former player. Robinson was also the last living player from the 1942 season, as well as the oldest living player whose major league career was interrupted by World War II service.\nEarly life.\nEddie Robinson was born and grew up in the Northeastern Texas town of Paris. He was the only child of William Edward Robinson, an automobile electrician born in Missouri, and Hazel Robinson, born in Tennessee. Eddie's father later left the family, and his parents divorced when Eddie was 12. He attended Paris Junior College.\nCareer.\nEddie Robinson, a left-handed batter who threw right-handed, played four seasons in the minor leagues before being briefly called up at the end of the 1942 season by the Cleveland Indians. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy after the 1942 season and did not resume his baseball career until 1946. He suffered a leg injury while in the service, and never fully recovered fully thanks to a botched operation, but he recovered sufficiently to enjoy an outstanding major league career. He enjoyed his most prominent team moment when, at the age of 27, he contributed to his first team, the Cleveland Indians, winning the 1948 World Series. Although traded during that offseason, he was still at the top of his game and with his next two teams, Washington Senators (1949–50) and Chicago White Sox (1950–52), experienced the most productive seasons of his time in the majors. In 1951 Robinson began his life-long relationship with Paul Richards when former player Richards started his major league career as a manager with the Chicago White Sox.\nOverall, he appeared in 1,315 games and batted .268 with 172 home runs, and 723 runs batted in. Defensively, he finished his career with a .990 fielding percentage playing every inning at first base. He did not play in the 1943 through 1945 seasons, due to his service in the U.S. Navy during World War II.\nA four-time All-Star, he was the American League's starting first baseman for the midsummer classics of 1949 and 1952. The first game was a slugfest, 11–7, won by the American League, with a Robinson first-inning single off National league starter Warren Spahn driving in Joe DiMaggio. In the 1952 game, a rain-shortened 3-2 National League victory, Robinson singled in the American League's first run, scoring Minnie Miñoso, who had led off the fourth inning with a double.\nOn April 25, 1951 he became one of the few players to hit a home run out of old Comiskey Park.\nIn 1955, while playing for the New York Yankees as a part-time player, Robinson hit 16 home runs while having only 36 hits. He also had more runs batted in than hits, knocking in 42 runs. For the season he hit only .208 in 173 at bats, and had 36 base-on-balls.\nRobinson was the oldest living Major League player who began his career during or after the 1940s, and he was the last living player whose Major League career was interrupted by World War II service. (Chris Haughey never made it back to the majors, and Eddie Basinski and Tommy Brown were civilians throughout the war.)\nPost-playing career.\nUpon retirement, Robinson became a coach for the Baltimore Orioles and then moved into their player development department. A protégé of Orioles manager and fellow Texan Paul Richards, he followed Richards to the Houston Astros, then worked as the farm system director of the Kansas City Athletics during the tempestuous ownership of Charlie Finley in the mid-1960s. In , Robinson rejoined Richards in the front office of the Atlanta Braves. He succeeded Richards as general manager of the Braves during the 1972 season, serving through early 1976 in that post.\nRobinson then returned to the American League as a member of the Texas Rangers front office. In 1977, Robinson was named co-general manager (with Dan O'Brien Sr.) of the Rangers, and became sole GM from 1978 to 1982. Although the Rangers posted winning seasons in 1977, 1978, and 1981, a disastrous 1982 campaign cost Robinson his job as general manager.\nContinuing in baseball as a scout and player development consultant, he found his last position as a scout for the Boston Red Sox, the only team of the \"original eight\" American League clubs that he did not play for.\nThe last living Cleveland Indians player to win a World Series championship (there are no living players who played on an earlier World Series championship team than Robinson's 1948 Indians), Robinson attended Game 6 of the 2016 World Series between the Indians and Chicago Cubs at Progressive Field in Cleveland. Robinson lived in Fort Worth, Texas. After the death of outfielder Val Heim, Robinson was recognized as the oldest living baseball player.\nPersonal life.\nRobinson enlisted in the U.S. Navy after the 1942 season; he served three years. After basic training, he married Elayne Elder in February 1943. They had two children, one of whom died in childhood, and divorced in 1951.\nRobinson married the former Bette Farlow, a native of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1955. The couple raised three sons — Marc, Drew, and Paul. As of 1993 they had lived in Woodhaven Country Club Estates for 15 years and also grew and sold pecans from a farm near Austin, Texas.\nRobinson resided in Fort Worth, Texas, where he and Bette moved in 1984.\nOn December 15, 2020, Robinson turned 100. He was working on a podcast, \"The Golden Age of Baseball\", through which he hoped to eventually have donations made to the Alzheimer's Foundation.\nDeath.\nEddie Robinson died on October 4, 2021, in Texas. He was 100."

He became a regular of the Dragons NRL side following his debut, playing at either lock, hooker or second row. In 2006, Young was selected as 18th man for New South Wales in the 2006 State of Origin decider in Melbourne, but did not play.\nIn 2007, Young played just three NRL games, missing the majority of the season due to a knee injury incurred in 2006 from a Lance Thompson tackle. His recovery was further hindered by complications from surgery which was performed to address this injury. In Round 3 of the 2008 NRL season, Young played his 100th NRL game in a 14–21 loss to the Canberra Raiders.\nIn July 2009, Young signed a three-year contract with the Dragons.\nIn May 2010, Young was selected to represent Country in the annual City vs Country Origin game, scoring two tries in Country's first victory since 2006.

        "text": "The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop. is Robert Coover's second novel, published in 1968.\nPlot summary.\nJ. Henry Waugh is an accountant, albeit an unhappy one. However, each night after he comes home from work, Henry immerses himself in a world of \"his\" choosing: a baseball league in which every action is ruled by the dice.\nThe novel opens with the excitement of a perfect game in progress. Henry, as owner of every team in the league, is flush with pride in the young rookie, who is pitching this rarest of rare games: Damon Rutherford, \"son\" of one of the league's all-time greats.\nWhen the young hurler completes the miracle game, Henry's life lights up. Giddy with happiness, Henry pushes himself and his league to the limits as he plays game after game so that he can see the young boy pitch again.\nAs fate would have it, the rookie Rutherford is killed by a bean-ball, a rare play from \"the Extraordinary Occurrences Chart\" in the game that Henry has invented and has used to see fifty-six \"seasons\" to conclusion. That Henry is also fifty-six marks a turning point in Henry's life. The \"death\" of the young pitcher on the table-top affects the real-life Henry in ways unimaginable. As Henry's personal life spirals out of control, he finally arrives at the solution that will save his league, his creation, and, ultimately, his sanity.\nAnalysis.\nThe novel is termed a \"black comic\" novel, as the book takes the reader back and forth between the real world and the fantasy world that Henry has created. The parts of the book that show us the \"Universal Baseball Association\" show us the fantasy world from the perspective, not of Henry, but of the players in the Association. Through these expositions, the players, managers, and league executives come to life.\nRobert Coover's work here delves into deep philosophical issues, one of which is the notion of creationism. Henry, through his game, has become a \"god\" of sorts. His game determines who lives and who dies, who fails and who succeeds. It has been suggested that the name, \"J. Henry Waugh\", is a veiled reference to \"Yahweh\", one of the Hebrew names of God in Judaism.\nCritical response.\nJohn Sexton, president of New York University, called the book \"the best book written about baseball by anyone\", a \"Joycean world, where a character has on his kitchen table a game run by the roll of dice, in which he's created an alternative baseball league that's more real to him than his life and real baseball ... And he has to decide whether he's going to intervene to change that or not. Now, doesn't that resonate to you about-- free will, free destiny?\" \"New York Times\" writer Matt Weiland, writing about the 2011 reissue of the book, called it \"one of the best baseball novels\", commenting, \"There is something terrifying about the U.B.A., but as with all tragedy it is a terror that once seen, and lived through, yields a stronger sense of being alive\"."

        "text": "The French Rugby Federation ( (\"FFR\")) is the governing body for rugby union in France. It is responsible for the French national team and the Ligue nationale de rugby that administers the country's professional leagues.\nHistory.\nBefore the FFR was established, football, rugby union and others sports in France were regulated by the Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques (USFSA). Founded in November 1890, the USFSA was initially headquartered in Paris but its membership soon expanded to include sports clubs from throughout France.\nThe FFR was formed in 1919 and is affiliated to World Rugby, the sport's governing body.\nIn 1934 the FFR set up the \"Fédération internationale de rugby amateur\", now known as Rugby Europe, in an attempt to organise rugby union outside the authority of World Rugby, then known as the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB). It included the national teams of Italy, French national team, Catalonia, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Germany national team.\nFollowing German occupation, FFR officials closely associated with the Vichy government lobbied to have certain \"un-French\" sports banned. Between the end of 1940 and the middle of 1942, one semi-professional and at least six French Amateur Sport Federations were banned and destroyed by the Vichy regime. These actions were independently verified by the French government in 2002.\nIn 1978 the Federation became a member of the IRFB, which later became the International Rugby Board and is now World Rugby."

        "text": "Archery at the 2005 SEA Games was held at Remy Field, Subic Bay Freeport Zone, Zambales, Philippines. The archery schedule began on November 28 and ended on December 4.\nThere were eight gold medals contested, with individual and team events for men and the same for women.\nThis was the first year that the compound archery category was introduced at the SEA Games.\nRanking rounds were done using a FITA round (now known as the 1440 round). The score from that round determined the match-ups in the elimination rounds, with high-ranking archers facing low-ranking archers.\nMatchplay at the SEA Games was done from a range of 70 meters. The target's total diameter was 122 cm. An archer had 40 seconds to fire each arrow. Each National Olympic Committee being able to enter a maximum of three archers. Each archer fired six ends, or groups, of 12 arrows per end in the ranking round. There were three rounds of elimination that used six ends of three arrows, narrowing the field of archers to 32, then to 16, then to 8. The three final rounds (quarterfinals, semifinals, and medal matches) each used four ends of three arrows.\nThe teams consisted of the country's three archers from the individual round, and the team's initial ranking was determined by summing the three members' scores in the individual ranking round. Each round of eliminations consisted of each team firing 27 arrows (9 by each archer)."

        "title": "Nick Evans (rugby union)",
        "text": "Nicholas John Evans (born 14 August 1980) is a New Zealand former rugby union player. He played at fly-half and fullback. He played for the Highlanders and the Blues in Super 14. At 28 he joined Harlequins for the 2008–09 Premiership Rugby season, and remained with the club until his retirement on a deal reportedly worth £320,000 a year. He retired at the end of the 2016–17 season and is now a coach for Quins.\nBiography.\nEvans was born in North Shore City in New Zealand, and attended Westlake Boys High School, where he played first five-eighth (fly-half) for his school's First XV. He played both rugby union and Aussie rules football at the school. He played club rugby with the East Coast Bays Rugby Club in the North Harbour Premiers.\nEvans graduated to the NZ under-21 and senior Aussie Rules Football sides, competed against state teams and was offered a trial with the Sydney Swans., turning it down to commit his future to rugby union.\nAlthough he has grown since, he was at the time considered short for professional Aussie Rules at 176 cm. He later decided to commit to rugby union and played for the Highlanders in the Super 14 and for Otago in the National Provincial Championship. However, on 25 May 2007 Evans announced he would not be re-signing with the Otago Rugby Football Union and would either sign for a Union closer to his family on the North Shore, or become one of many New Zealand rugby players heading overseas if he did not make the All Blacks World Cup squad. He decided to move closer to his family.\nPlaying career.\nNew Zealand.\nAfter impressing in both provincial and Super rugby, he made his All Blacks debut aged 23 against England in 2004. In his last game against Wales when he came on as a replacement for Carter, he broke the line with his first touch off first phase to set up Sitiveni Sivivatu for an easy try underneath the posts.\nEvans was selected in the 30-man New Zealand Squad at the 2007 Rugby World Cup. He started at first five-eighth against Portugal in a game which New Zealand won 108–13, and in the process accumulated 33 points via 14 conversions and a try. He played in the game against Scotland, having been summoned from the bench to play at fullback and looked very handy. He was rewarded with a further start at fullback against Romania and scored 17 points through a try and six conversions.\nEvans was overlooked for New Zealand's 2008 Tri Nations series. After signing with English Premiership side Harlequin FC, he became ineligible to play for his national side due to the NZRU's policy of only selecting players within New Zealand to play for the All Blacks side.\nPremiership.\nSince joining the Harlequins, Evans has been a chief architect of on-field success of the club. He was instrumental in the Harlequins back-to-back defeats of Stade Français in the Heineken Cup and helped salvage a draw for his side in their Boxing Day clash with the Leicester Tigers in the Guinness Premiership. During the 2010–11 season Evans has continued his on field success at Harlequins with his most notable performance coming in the European Challenge Cup, putting a man of the match effort against London Wasps in the quarter finals and kicking the winning conversion in the final against Stade Francais. Evans signed a new contract with Harlequins to see him with the club until 2013.\nHe started for Harlequins in their 2011–12 Premiership final victory over Leicester Tigers and scored six penalties and one conversion.\nRetirement.\nIn April 2017, Evans announced his retirement from rugby after the 2016–17 Premiership season with Harlequins. His last home game for Quins was against Wasps on 28 April 2017.\nShortly after his retirement from playing, he was appointed as an attack coach for Quins.\nCoaching career.\nSince 2017, Evans has been attack coach with Harlequins. Whilst in this role, the team won the English Premiership during the 2020-21 season beating Exeter Chiefs 40-38 in the final.\nIn January 2023, prior to the 2023 Six Nations, Evans was appointed as attack for the England national team by Head Coach Steve Borthwick on a short term deal. The campaign ended disappointingly with England finishing 4th. Evans was still under contract with Harlequins who decided it was 'unreasonable' to release him for another extended period with England. He returned to his position as attack coach with Harlequins following the end of the tournament."

He died in a car crash near Los Angeles after being indefinitely banned from the NFL for repeated violations of the league's substance abuse policy.\nEarly life.\nDarrell Anthony Russell, Jr. was born in Pensacola, Florida. His mother, Eleanor Russell, divorced in 1986 from Darrell Anthony Russell Sr. when their only child was four years old, and moved from Florida to Southern California. Russell grew up in a rough part of San Diego just a few blocks from Lincoln Kennedy. Russell graduated from St. Augustine High School.\nCollege career.\nRussell attended the University of Southern California and, after a dominant 1996 season that featured 19 tackles for loss, was taken second overall in the 1997 NFL draft by Al Davis and the Raiders.\nProfessional career.\nAt , 320-pounds Russell ran the 40-yard dash in 4.8 seconds. Russell was selected with the second overall pick in the first round of the 1997 NFL Draft. Russell's seven-year, $22 million contract in 1997 was at the time the richest rookie contract ever signed in the NFL.\nHe went on to have 28.5 career sacks. After making the Pro Bowl in 1998 and 1999, averaging ten sacks per year, he was poised to have a dominant NFL career. However, the following season he failed a drug test, which his lawyer attributed to \"second-hand smoke,\" and was later suspended for four games in 2001 for a second violation, this time for failing to be tested. Shortly after that, he tested positive for a banned substance and was given a one-year suspension, which effectively wiped out his 2002 season. Russell missed 1½ years while serving two league suspensions before he played in eight games in 2003 for the Washington Redskins. However, the positive drug tests kept coming, and Russell was suspended indefinitely by the league. Russell's positive drug test in 2004 was his seventh infraction of the league's drug policy. His last NFL experience was in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers training camp in 2004.\nActing career.\nIn 2002, he played as himself in an episode of \"The Jersey\" called \"Coleman's Big Date\" where at an Oakland Raiders football game, his date jumps into his body as Coleman Galloway (played by Jermaine Williams) jumps into a cheerleaders' body.\nPersonal.\nHe was accused in 2002 of videotaping the rape of a woman—who had been drugged with GHB—by two friends, but prosecutors dropped the charges.\nDeath.\nOn December 15, 2005, Russell was a passenger in a 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix driven by close friend and former USC teammate Michael Bastianelli when it veered out of control, hitting several objects including a tree and a fire hydrant before hitting a parked bus. Both men were found unconscious and taken to area hospitals, where they were pronounced dead."

Smith played college football for the USC Trojans.\nHigh school career.\nSmith played high school football as a wide receiver and defensive back at Santa Monica High School (Samohi). He was the CIF Southern Section Co-Player of the Year in 1976. Dennis Smith was a great prospect who went on to be a Pro Bowl player. But at that time his standard as a player was to emulate Dennis Thurman, who had been such an outstanding player previously at Samohi in 1974 who also later starred at USC and Smith would eventually follow Thurman as a freshman to run track and play football at USC as a safety. Smith also ran on the track &amp; field team at Santa Monica and broke the HS high jump record (which has since been eclipsed) in 1977. He was coached by Tebb Kusserow. who also coached number of other NFL players such as Dennis Thurman, Junior Thurman, Mel Kaufman, Pat O'Hara, Glyn Milburn, Sam Anno, Damone Johnson, and others notables such as actor Dean Cain. Smith has also been inducted into the Santa Monica High School Hall of Fame for athletes and has had his number \"symbolically\" retired by the school.\nCollege career.\nSmith was a consensus All-America choice as a senior at University of Southern California in 1980. He played in two Rose Bowls for the Trojans. He played in a secondary which included three future NFL All-Pros: the San Francisco 49ers' Ronnie Lott and the Minnesota Vikings' Joey Browner in addition to himself. Smith was a consensus All-America choice as he lettered four times in football and three times in track. He posted 205 career tackles and 16 interceptions.

Smith played at Southern California (1977–1980) for John Robinson in a star-studded defensive backfield and is a member of the USC team that won the national championship in 1978.\nProfessional career.\nSmith established himself as one of the most feared and hardest hitting safeties in the NFL (a reputation later held by his protégé, Steve Atwater). Smith was voted to play in six Pro Bowls (following the 1985–1986, 1989–1991 and 1993 seasons), was named All-American Football Conference (AFC) in 1984 and 1988. He played on three Broncos Super Bowl teams (XXI, XXII, XXIV), and was named All-Pro four times.\nSmith's career totals include 1,171 tackles, 30 interceptions and 15 sacks. He posted a career-high five interceptions in 1991. He ranks fourth all-time among Denver Broncos in games played with the franchise with 184. He is the Broncos' leading tackler of all time with 1,152 recorded tackles.\nSmith was named the Denver Broncos's most inspirational player in 1992.

        "text": "Paul Brian McDonald (born February 23, 1958) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for the Cleveland Browns and Dallas Cowboys. He played college football for the USC Trojans, earning second-team All-American honors in 1979.\nEarly years.\nMcDonald attended Bishop Amat Memorial High School. He received All-state honors in football as a senior. He accepted a football scholarship from the University of Southern California. As a true freshman, he was the third-string quarterback behind Vince Evans and Rob Hertel. As a sophomore, he was promoted to backup quarterback behind Hertel after Evans graduated.\nAs a junior, he was named the starter at quarterback after Hertel graduated. He was part of a backfield that included running back Charles White and Lynn Cain, which helped the team capture a share of the national championship with the University of Alabama in the 1978 season. He passed for 1,690 yards (led the Pac-10), 19 touchdowns (tied school record), 7 interceptions and led the NCAA in pass efficiency with a rating of 152.8. His only loss in his two years as a starter was against Arizona State University in 1978. Injuries to the Trojans' top two centers led to several fumbled snaps that opened the door for Sun Devil and future NFL quarterback Mark Malone to win\n20-7.\nHe was a senior in 1979, and he played in a backfield that included future Heisman Trophy winners White and Marcus Allen. He posted 2,223 passing yards, 18 touchdowns and 6 interceptions. He led the team to a 17-16 win against Ohio State University, after it entered the 1980 Rose Bowl as the number one ranked team in the nation. He finished sixth in the 1979 Heisman Trophy voting.\nHe was known for his poise and as a winner, finishing his college career with a 22-1-1 record, holding the NCAA mark for the lowest interception percentage in a career at 2.3% (13 interceptions in 561 attempts) and the Pac-10 record of 143 straight passes without an interception. In 2005, he received the NCAA Silver Anniversary Award.\nProfessional career.\nCleveland Browns.\nMcDonald was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fourth round (109th overall) of the 1980 NFL Draft. He was a backup behind quarterback Brian Sipe in his first 4 seasons.\nIn 1982, he replaced Sipe (who was suffering from a sore throwing arm) in the last three games of the strike-shortened season, posting a 2-1 record and helping the team make the playoffs that had been expanded to 16 teams. He started in the first round of the playoffs, which resulted in a 27-10 loss against the Oakland Raiders, after throwing for 281 yards and 1 touchdown with no interceptions. Sipe won back the starting job the next season.\nIn 1983, Sipe regained his starting job and McDonald returned to his backup role.\nIn 1984, Sipe signed with the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League and the Browns gave the starting job to McDonald, who decided to stay in the NFL, despite also receiving offers to move. Defensive coordinator Marty Schottenheimer took over the Browns head coaching job halfway through the season. McDonald had a 5-11 record after enduring 53 sacks and registering 3,472 passing yards, 14 touchdowns and 23 interceptions. Against the New England Patriots, he had a career-high 320 passing yards on 23 out of 37 attempts (62.2%) and one touchdown. Against the New Orleans Saints, he tallied a career-high 75% completion percentage (18 out of 24). Against the Houston Oilers, he completed 13 straight passes.\nIn 1985, the team traded for veteran Gary Danielson and selected Bernie Kosar in the first round of the NFL supplemental draft, which dropped McDonald to third-string quarterback. In 1986, the team traded for Mike Pagel, who passed McDonald on the depth chart, causing him to be waived on June 26. He left the Browns after passing for 5,269 yards, 24 touchdowns and 37 interceptions.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nOn July 16, 1986, he signed as a free agent with the Seattle Seahawks. On August 26, he was released after the team opted to keep only two quarterbacks.\nDallas Cowboys.\nOn November 4, 1986, he was signed by the Dallas Cowboys as a free agent to be the third-string quarterback, after starter Danny White was lost for the season with a broken right wrist he suffered during the 14-17 loss against the New York Giants. He reunited with pass offense coordinator Paul Hackett, who was one of his coaches with the Trojans and the Browns. McDonald also became the first left hander quarterback to make the team in franchise history.\nIn 1987, he beat rookie Kevin Sweeney for the third-string quarterback job, leading the team with a 92.0 quarterback rating in pre-season. The players went on a strike in the third week of the season. Earlier games were canceled, reducing the 16 game season to 15 games. The NFL decided that the games were going to be played with replacement players. Sweeney was signed to be a part of the Dallas Cowboys replacement team. Sweeney had success, and he was kept on the roster for the rest of the year along with McDonald. On August 23, 1988, he was released without playing a down in his time with the team.\nPersonal life.\nMcDonald went into business after football, working as a Financial Consultant for Merrill Lynch, Vice President for Wells Fargo Bank and Senior Vice President at Fidelity National Title Insurance Company.\nMcDonald did radio color commentary for USC Trojans football games and lives in Newport Beach, California. He received the award for being the best radio color analyst given yearly by the Southern California Sports Broadcasters Association in 2002 and 2004.

The company website is gamechangenation.com. McDonald and Baric first met when they collaborated on \"A City Divided\", a documentary film about the USC vs. UCLA football rivalry, which was used as a catalyst of \"Rivals United for a Kure,\" a campaign to raise funds for cancer research. \nHis son Mike, was the third-string quarterback for the USC Trojans behind John David Booty and Mark Sanchez, during the 2006 and 2007 seasons. He also was a part of two national championship teams. McDonald's middle son, Andrew played quarterback at New Mexico State (2012-2013). His youngest son, Matt, started at quarterback for three years at Bowling Green (2020-2022) after seeing limited playing time for Boston College in 2017-2018 "

        "title": "Canada at the 2006 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "Canada competed at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, with a team of 196 athletes and 220 support staff.\nAs host of the upcoming 2010 Winter Olympics, Canada was pressured to do well at the 2006 Games. The Canadian Olympic Committee's goal for 2006 was to have a top three finish in the medal count or 25 total medals, as a start to reach their goal of having the highest medal count at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia. Canada had managed to increase its medal count at each Winter Olympics since the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, United States. World Cup results from the 2005–06 season seemed to indicate that Canada would have a good performance in Turin, Italy. Canada met one of those goals and nearly met the other by finishing third behind the United States and Germany with 24 medals. The Games were also the first litmus test for the increased athletic funding and resources pursued by the \"Own the Podium\" 2010 program.\nAnother task for the Canadian contingent was to promote the 2010 Games, Vancouver and surrounding region, the province of British Columbia, as well as Canada as a nation. This was evident in the Canadian participation in the closing ceremonies of the Games and the establishment of the \"Canada House\" in Turin. The Games also provided opportunities for organizing committees to gather experience and strategies to run the Games in Vancouver.\nMedalists.\nCanada's total medal count of 24 was the highest ever won by the nation in any Winter Olympics, and was the second highest total for the country at \"any\" Olympic games (summer or winter), exceeded only by the 44 medals won at the 1984 Summer Olympics which were boycotted by the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc countries. Not only did Canada increase its total medal count from the previous Winter Games for the 7th straight time (since 1980), but the total medal count was also the \"best ever\" for Canada for the 5th straight time (since 1992).\nCanada won at least one medal in 10 of the 15 sport disciplines competed at the games, and gold medals in 6 different disciplines; both feats were unmatched by any other nation. Canada also had the most 4th and 5th-place finishes (14 and 9 respectively) of any country in these games. These results support the effectiveness of the \"Own the Podium\" 2010 program.\nCindy Klassen bested the total Olympic medals collected in a single Games by a Canadian, with 5, and bested the total Olympic medal count of any Canadian (Winter and Summer) with 6. The previous record of 3 medals at a single Olympics was held by Gaetan Boucher for the 1984 Winter Olympics and Marc Gagnon at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Meanwhile, Clara Hughes tied the old mark of 5 career Olympic medals, held by Marc Gagnon and Phil Edwards. Sixteen of the 24 medals were won by female athletes. At age 50, Russ Howard became the oldest Canadian gold medalist in Olympic history.\nAlpine skiing.\nNote: In the men's combined, run 1 is the downhill, and runs 2 and 3 are the slalom. In the women's combined, run 1 and 2 are the slalom, and run 3 the downhill.\nCross-country skiing.\nSean Crooks was suspended for 5 days by the International Ski Federation for having excessive hemoglobin levels. He was able to participate in the men's sprint and 4× 10 km relay.\nCurling.\nMen's.\nThe Canadian foursome won the country's first Olympic medal in men's curling, and became the first Winter Olympic gold medal winners from the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Russ Howard was designated the skip by World Curling Federation rules, but Gushue threw last stones, and was considered to be the team leader.\nGushue's rink finished first in the round-robin at the Canadian Olympic Curling Trials, then beat Jeff Stoughton in the final to secure the Olympic berth.\nThe Minister of Education for Newfoundland and Labrador canceled classes across the province in the afternoon to allow children to watch the game.\nWomen's.\nShannon Kleibrink's rink finished third in the round-robin at the Canadian Olympic Curling Trials, then won the semifinal over Stefanie Lawton and the final over Kelly Scott to secure the Olympic berth.\nKey: The hammer indicates which team had the last stone in the first end.\nFigure skating.\nKey: CD = Compulsory Dance, FD = Free Dance, FS = Free Skate, OD = Original Dance, SP = Short Program\nFreestyle skiing.\nJennifer Heil became the first Canadian woman to ever win gold in freestyle skiing after winning for women's moguls. At the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, she finished fourth and ended up a hundredth of a point off the podium.\nDale Begg-Smith, who won gold in men's moguls for Australia, was born in Canada and holds dual citizenship. He originally started skiing in Canada but found Canada's training program too restrictive. He moved to Australia to have more time to work on his business interests. Ironically, his win bumped Marc-André Moreau down to 4th place and off of the podium.\nIce hockey.\nHockey, like the previous two Olympics, attracted significant attention from Canadian fans. Many consider the Canadian men's team's performance in Turin as the most disappointing in years. In the last four games of the tournament, Canada failed to score in 11 of 12 periods, losing with the same score (2–0) against Switzerland, Finland, and in the quarterfinals against Russia. Hockey commentators, including Kelly Hrudey, commented that Canada did not play well as a team. The match against the Czech Republic was believed to be a better performance by the hockey team but the team lost to Russia two days after.\nThe quarterfinal game against Russia was watched on television screens across the nation in the afternoon Canadian time. The intensity of the game increased as the scoreless tie extended into the third period.\nHowever, in the women's hockey discipline, Team Canada dominated the field with numerous wins leading up to their gold medal winning game.\nNordic combined.\nNote: 'Deficit' refers to the amount of time behind the leader a competitor began the cross-country portion of the event. Italicized numbers show the final deficit from the winner's finishing time.\nShort track speed skating.\nKey: 'ADV' indicates a skater was advanced due to being interfered with.\nSkeleton.\nMellisa Hollingsworth-Richards won a bronze medal in Skeleton, thus becoming the first Canadian to win an Olympic medal in the event. A day later, Duff Gibson became the first Canadian to win a gold medal in the event after taking the men's gold. Fellow Canadian Jeff Pain won the silver medal, and there were chances of a bronze as well; however, their teammate placed fourth.\nGibson, 39, became the oldest competitor to win an individual gold medal in Winter Olympics history, surpassing Al MacInnis as the oldest Canadian to win a gold medal. MacInnis won gold at the 2002 Winter Olympics on the Canadian men's hockey team.\nSki jumping.\nNote: PQ indicates a skier was pre-qualified for the final, based on entry rankings.\nSnowboarding.\nMaëlle Ricker and Dominique Vallee competed in two of the Snowboarding disciplines, halfpipe and snowboard cross, while Jasey-Jay Anderson competed in snowboard cross and parallel giant slalom.\nNote: In the final, the single best score from two runs is used to determine the ranking. A bracketed score indicates a run that wasn't counted.\nKey: '+ Time' represents a deficit; the brackets indicate the results of each run.\nSpeed skating.\nCanada became the first country to set a new record at the 2006 Winter Olympics when both its men's and women's teams set an Olympic record in the qualifying round of the team pursuit.\nCindy Klassen set or tied several medal records. She became the first Canadian to win five medals in one Olympics, winning a gold (1500 m), two silver medals (team pursuit, 1000 m) and two bronze medals (3000 m, 5000 m). Her bronze medal at the 2002 Winter Olympics gives her a total of six medals and the title of the most decorated Canadian Olympian, winter or summer. Tied at five medals for Canada are short track speed skater Marc Gagnon, track athlete Dr. Phil Edwards, and speed skater Clara Hughes, who won her fourth and fifth medal at the 2006 Olympics. In addition to the Canadian medal records, Klassen also tied Eric Heiden to win the most medals by a speed skater at a single Olympics.\nFlag bearer.\nWomen's ice hockey player Danielle Goyette carried the flag for Canada in the opening ceremony. Cross-country skier Beckie Scott, bobsledder Pierre Lueders, long-track speedskaters Cindy Klassen and Clara Hughes all said that they would not submit their names to carry the flag.\nScott, Klassen and Hughes all had events within two days of the opening ceremonies and believed that not participating in the opening ceremonies would give them a better chance at a finishing well in their events. Lueders turned down the chance because at the time it appeared that his bobsleigh partner, Lascelles Brown, would not be granted Canadian citizenship. Afterwards, Lueders said he would carry the flag but said that Brown would be a much better choice.\nSome criticized these choices, including hockey analyst Don Cherry, who called the athletes unpatriotic and said that other athletes would have loved to have had the opportunity. Others, including past flag bearer Catriona Le May Doan spoke in favour of their decisions, saying that the opening ceremonies were a long process and took a lot of energy. She criticized Don Cherry, saying that many athletes in the past had turned down the flag-bearing opportunity at the opening ceremonies in order to focus on their competition, and that Don Cherry, having never participated in international athletic competition, does not have the right to be critical of Olympic athletes.\nAfter winning five medals (more than any other Canadian at a Winter Games), Cindy Klassen accepted the selection as the flag bearer for the closing ceremonies.\nOther participation.\nAs the host nation of the next Winter Games, Canada's role was to promote the 2010 Winter Olympics, its host city, its host province, and the country over the duration of these Games. \"Canada House\" was a log cabin constructed with Canadian pine wood and it was one of 12 nation's houses established in Turin. The pavilion opened its doors to the public on January 23, 2006, at piazza Valdo Fusi, in the city centre and would remain open until March 20 at the conclusion of the Paralympic Winter Games. Aside from showcasing Canadian culture, the building would host meetings for companies from British Columbia and Italy who would be interested to develop business partnerships. The building would be donated to the city of Turin and would be transferred to a new city park after the Games.\nDuring the closing ceremonies of these Games, there was a brief segment in which Canada delivered a preview of the 2010 Games. This included a choreographed program featuring Avril Lavigne, raising of the Canadian flag, and singing of O Canada by opera star Ben Heppner, himself a B.C. native. The handover of the Games was highlighted by Vancouver mayor Sam Sullivan, a quadriplegic, accepting and waving the Olympic flag. Aside from the flag handed from the mayor of Turin Sergio Chiamparino, the City of Vancouver is now the custodian of the actual Olympic flag lowered at Stadio Olimpico during the closing ceremonies.\nBritish Columbia Premier Gordon Campbell, himself a Vancouver native, and Governor General Michaëlle Jean attended the Games' competitions and closing ceremonies. They also availed themselves to the news media, sharing their thoughts about British Columbia and Canada welcoming the world in 2010. The federal government was represented by the attendance of Foreign Affairs Minister Peter MacKay at the closing ceremonies.\nA number of Canadian citizens with dual citizenship have competed for other countries and served as their respective flag bearers:\nIn Ottawa, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a statement that the Olympic flame had begun the journey to Vancouver.\nOfficial outfitter.\nHBC became the official outfitter of clothing for members of the Canadian Olympic team and replacing Roots Canada. The same clothing was also sold at HBC stores in Canada. HBC had been the official outfitters for Canada's Winter teams in 1936, 1960, 1964 and 1968."

        "title": "Ocean rowing",
        "text": "Ocean rowing is the sport of rowing across oceans. Some ocean rowing boats can hold as many as fourteen rowers; however, the most common ocean rowboats are designed for singles, doubles, and fours.\nThe history of ocean rowing is divided into two eras by the Ocean Rowing Society International, the official adjudicator of ocean rowing records for Guinness World Records. The first fourteen ocean rows, up to and including 1981, are considered \"historic\" ocean rows as they were completed with very limited, if any, modern technology. All subsequent rows are described as \"modern-day\" rows.\nHistory.\nThe first ocean to be deliberately rowed across was the Atlantic by Frank Samuelsen and George Harbo, two Norwegian-born Americans, in June 1896. The pair left Battery Park, Manhattan, on 6 June 1896, arriving on the Isles of Scilly, 55 days and 13 hours later, having covered . They continued to row to Le Havre, France. No such crossing would be officially attempted again for 70 years' time, and, in a testament to the sport's inherent danger, the first to try to repeat the feat, again a two-man crew rowing the Atlantic from west to east, were lost at sea in 1966. However, that same year, John Ridgway and Chay Blyth successfully rowed across the Atlantic in 92 days.\nThe first solo crossing of an ocean was completed by John Fairfax of Britain on 19 July 1969. He rowed from Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands to Hollywood Beach, Florida in 180 days. In the same year Tom McClean, also of Britain, rowed from Newfoundland, Canada arriving in Blacksod Bay, Ireland on 27 July 1969. Despite having left almost four months after Fairfax, he came within 8 days of beating Fairfax to the title of first solo rower of any ocean.\nIn 1974, Derek Paul King and Peter Bird rowed across the Atlantic Ocean from Gibraltar to St. Lucia in Britannia II - the boat designed by Uffa Fox and first rowed by John Fairfax and Sylvia Cook across the Pacific Ocean in 1971/72.\nKathleen and Curtis Saville were the first people born in America to row across the Atlantic Ocean from Casablanca to Antigua in 1981 and Kathleen was the first woman to row the North Atlantic Ocean.\nIn 2023, Finnish firefighter Jari Saario became the first human ever to row across Atlantic Ocean twice. He started his first row from Gran Canaria, Canary Islands to Antigua at 23 January 2023 and arrived at Antigua on 28 March 2023. He started his second row from St. Johns, Canada at 22 June 2023 and ended his rowing tour at Cuxhaven, Germany October 10 2023.\nKenneth Crutchlow, the founder of ORSI, was the major contributor to popularizing ocean rowing.\nOn the 25th of April 2023, Aurimas Valujavičius reached the United States becoming the third person in the world and the first Lithuanian to row solo across the Atlantic Ocean from Europe.\nTraveller and vlogger Valujavičius set out across the Atlantic from Ayamonte, Spain, on 26 December 2022. His journey lasted for 120 days before he reached his destination, Miami, Florida.\nAtlantic crossings.\nAmyr Klink was the first person to row across the South Atlantic, leaving from Lüderitz, Namibia on 9 June 1984 and arriving 101 days later in Salvador, Brazil on 18 September 1984.\nIn September 1987, Don Allum became the first to row the Atlantic in both directions, having successfully completed a 77-day solo journey from Newfoundland, Canada to Achill Island, Ireland and having previously rowed from Gran Canaria to Barbados in 1971 with his cousin Geoff Allum, in 73 days.\nOne man holds the world record for both the fastest solo boat to cross the Atlantic and the fastest duo - Dutch Mark Slats crossed the Atlantic Ocean solo in only 30 days, seven hours and 49 minutes in 2017. Mark rowed the Atlantic again in 2020 with a fellow Dutchman Kai Weedmer. The duo were first to arrive in Antigua beating all 3, 4 and 5 man crews participating in the Atlantic Challenge and broke the record for the fastest pair to row across the Atlantic Ocean taking just 32 days, 22 hours, 13 minutes. Their boat 'Maria' a D12 from The Ocean Rowing Company was built by Mark Slats himself.\nThe world record for the fastest 4 man crossing of the Atlantic Ocean in a rowing boat is held by team The Four Oarsmen. During the Talisker Whisky Atlantic challenge they rowed 4,722 km (2,554 nautical miles) from La Gomera in the Canary Islands to Antigua aboard a Rannoch R45 boat named \"Aegir\", arriving on 12 January 2018. They rowed the Atlantic Ocean Trade Winds I route (open-class category) in 29 days and 15 hours. The four man team consisted of close friends (Stuart Watts, Peter Robinson, Richard Taylor and George Biggar – all from the United Kingdom). \"Aegir\" is the fastest rowing boat to cross any ocean, at an average speed of 3.589 knots, beating the previous record held by \"Sara G\" since 2011.\nThe fastest rowing record to cross the Atlantic Ocean by a female crew was created by Chinese women Cloris Chen Yuli, Amber Li Xiaobing, Tina Liang Mintian and Sarah Meng Yajie at the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge 2017, rowing boat \"Jasmine 2\". Arriving on 18 January 2018, they rowed from La Gomera to Antigua in 34 days, 13 hours, 13 minutes, shattering the previous record of 40 days, 8 hours, 26 minutes set two years ago by a British team. Their team Kung Fu Cha Cha was the first team from Asia to row across the Atlantic Ocean. With an average age of 23.5, the four students from Shantou University became the youngest team ever to row across the Atlantic. Before attending university, they had no experience in ocean rowing.\nThe fastest Atlantic crossing by a female crew of three was 42 days, 7 hours, 17 minutes between 12 December 2021 and 23 January 2022 over the Canaries to Antigua course, achieved by English crew Kat Cordiner, Charlotte Irving and Abby Johnston rowing \"Dolly Parton\".\nAn eleven-man French crew aboard \"La Mondiale\" set the record for the fastest row from Santa Cruz de La Palma to Martinique, in 1992 at 35 days, 8 hours, and 30 minutes.\nOn 3 December 1999, Tori Murden of the United States became the first woman to row any ocean solo when she arrived in Guadeloupe, having set off from Tenerife in the Canary Islands 81 days earlier. In March 2006, Julie Wafaei of Canada became the first woman to row across the Atlantic from mainland to mainland.\nOn 10 July 2005, the \"Vivaldi Atlantic\" four-man team (Nigel Morris, George Rock, Steve Dawson, Rob Munslow) set the record for fastest unsupported row from St John's, Newfoundland to the longitude of Bishop Rock lighthouse, United Kingdom. They left on 31 May 2005, arriving back on 10 July 2005 in a time of 39 days 22 hours and 10 minutes setting a Guinness World Record. The \"Vivaldi Atlantic\" four also became the first four-man team ever to row the North Atlantic west to east.\nThe fastest unsupported row from the United States to England was set in 2005 by The Ocean Fours (NL) (Gijs Groeneveld, Robert Hoeve, Jaap Koomen, Maarten Staarink) with the \"Vopak Victory\". They left New York on 27 May and crossed the Bishops Rock longitude 60 days, 16 hours, and 19 minutes later. This record was beaten by Leven Brown and his crew in 2010. Their boat \"Artemis Investments\" left New York on 17 June 2010 and arrived in St Mary's on 31 July 2010 in a time of 43 days 21 hours 26 mins and 48 seconds. This has remained the record to date for the longer and original North Atlantic route. During their voyage they were capsized twice in storms.\nFrenchman Charles Hedrich set the record for the fastest solo Atlantic crossing in 2007, from Dakar to Brazil in 36 days and 6 hours. Charles Hedrich is also the first man to complete a double Atlantic crossing nonstop, rowing solo and unassisted. Leaving from Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, his path took him eastward across the North Atlantic to the Canary islands, and then westward back to Martinique. The expedition lasted 145 days and 22 hours, ending on 1 December 2012.\nOn 14 June 2007, Bhavik Gandhi became the first Asian to row the Atlantic solo, nonstop and unsupported from Spain to Antigua. The trip, lasting 106 days, also set the record for the longest solo row across the Atlantic Ocean.\nA fourteen-man British and Irish crew skippered by Leven Brown aboard \"La Mondiale\" set a new world record crossing the mid-Atlantic from east-to-west, Gran Canaria to Barbados, of 33 days, 7 hours, and 30 minutes from December 15, 2007, to January 17, 2008.\nIn 2010, Katie Spotz of the United States rowed solo mainland-to-mainland Dakar, Senegal–Georgetown, Guyana, in 70 days. At 22 years and 260 days old, she held the record as the youngest person to row solo across an ocean until 2018 when American Oliver Crane crossed the Atlantic solo at 19 years and 148 days old.\nThe record for the fastest crossing from Africa to the West Indies was set in 2011 by a six-man crew aboard \"Sara G\" (Matt Craughwell, Fiann Paul, Tomas Cremona, Adam Burke, Rob Byrne and Graham Carlin), with a crossing time of 33 days 21 hours and 46 minutes from Morocco to the West Indies. Sara G travelled at an average speed of 3.386 knots and the highest total number of days rowed above 100 miles per day (16 days). The Atlantic speed record was the first of four speed records earning Fiann Paul the Guinness World Record of \"The first person to hold current speed records on four oceans\" in 2017.\nFrom 10 October 2011 to 11 March 2012, Erden Eruç set the record for the longest distance rowed across the Atlantic, solo and nonstop, crossing from Lüderitz, Namibia to Güiria, Venezuela along a route of in days.\nGerard Marie of France set the record as the oldest solo ocean rower in 2015 at 66 years 323 days old, while Diana Hoff of the United Kingdom set the record as the oldest female solo ocean rower in 2000 at 55 years 135 days old.

They left La Gomera and on 12 December 2021 and arrived in Antigua 53 days 3 hours and 42 minutes. With a combined age of 124 Years and 301 days.\nAtlantic rowing races.\nRowing the Atlantic first became mainstream when the first Atlantic Rowing Race was launched by Sir Chay Blyth, after reflecting on his own ocean row that propelled him to international renown. This was the \"Port St. Charles, Barbados Atlantic Rowing Race\". Thirty double-handed teams lined up at the start line in a \"one design\" rowing boat just outside Los Gigantes marina on Sunday 12 October 1997. The race was won by \"Kiwi Challenge\", rowed by Rob Hamill and Phil Stubbs after 41 days at sea. Second place went to the French crew of \"Atlantik Challenge\", Joseph Le Guen and his partner, a double convicted murderer, Pascal Blond.\nLater Atlantic rowing races:\nPacific Ocean rowing.\nFollowing his successful Atlantic Ocean crossing, John Fairfax set off from San Francisco in California on 26 April 1971 with Sylvia Cook. After three stops (in Mexico, Fanning Island and the Gilbert Island of Onotoa), the two arrived on Hayman Island in Australia 361 days later on 22 April 1972. Cook became the first woman to row any ocean.\nKathleen and Curtis Saville were the first to row from South America (Callao, Peru) to Cairns, Australia from 1984 - 1985. Their journey was recorded on the Ocean Rowing Society's site. Kathleen is also the first woman to row across two oceans - Atlantic Ocean in 1981 and South Pacific Ocean from 1984 to 1985. In 1976 Patrick Quesnel completed a crossing from Washington State to Hawaii, a journey of which took him 114 days.

Bird would later die attempting the west to east journey across the Pacific. Briton Jim Shekhdar later made the claim to be \"the first person to row across the Pacific single-handed\". Shekhdar had rowed across the Pacific non-stop, solo and unassisted arriving in Australia on 30 March 2001. Some within the sport felt that Shekhdar had not given due credit to the achievement of Peter Bird and the term \"unassisted\" also came under some scrutiny.\nRoz Savage rowed from San Francisco to Hawaii in 2008, the first woman to do so solo, and from Hawaii to Tuvalu in 2009. She completed the third leg her trip (from Tuvalu to PNG) in 2010 and so became the first woman to row across the Pacific Ocean unassisted. Chris Martin and Mick Dawson rowed a two-man boat from Choshi, Japan to San Francisco Harbour, USA in 2009. Their journey took 189 days and in doing so they achieved the Guinness World Record for being the first team to row across the North Pacific Ocean.\nFrom 10 July 2007 to 17 May 2008 Erden Eruç rowed westward from Bodega Bay, California for a total of 312 consecutive days, setting the current world record for a non-stop unassisted ocean row. Eruç completed a solo human-powered circumnavigation from 2007 to 2012, crossing the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans becoming the first person to row all three.\nFrom 22 December 2013 to 31 May 2014 Fyodor Konyukhov crossed Pacific Ocean starting in the Chilean port of Concón and finishing in Mooloolaba, Queensland, Australia without entering ports and without any external help or assistance. He covered the distance of more than 17408 km (9400 nautical miles) on the Turgoyak rowboat in just 162 days. On 26 December 2015, British-born Canadian, John Beeden, 53, became the first person to successfully row non-stop, unassisted from North America to Australia covering 7400 nautical miles in 209 days. Beeden had previously completed a non-stop, solo Atlantic crossing in 2011.\nOn June 18, 2019, Jacob Adoram Hendrickson set the Guinness World Record for completing the longest solo, nonstop, unassisted ocean row across the Pacific from North America. Hendrickson launched with zero ocean boating experience, determined to travel a greater distance than previous rowers, without any stops or resupplies along the way.\nHendrickson departed Neah Bay, Washington on July 7, 2018. Each day, he rowed an average 10–12 hours for 336 days at sea, reaching a distance of 7,145 miles when he landed in Cairns, Australia. Hendrickson also holds the Guinness world record for the longest time rowed nonstop across any ocean.\nGreat Pacific Race.\nIn June 2014, the first rowing race to take place on the Pacific Ocean started from Monterey, California, and ended in Honolulu, Hawaii. The Great Pacific Race was organized by New Ocean Wave which is run by Chris Martin and Roz Savage, both experienced ocean rowers.\nThirteen crews started the first Great Pacific Race in June 2014—four solo crews, three pairs, and six four-person teams representing ten nationalities. Due to logistical difficulties, some crews did not pass mandatory boat checks before the start of the race, and the decision was taken to operate a split start. Crews who were ready started on June 9, and the rest departed during the next available weather window on June 18. Rough weather at the start prompted several of the entrants to retire in the first few days. The pairs team Clearly Contacts retired after due to sea sickness and rowed back to Monterey. The solo entrant, Daryl Farmer, also accepted a tow by one of the race support boats after severe sea sickness that lasted several days. Other crews retired early for various reasons. The crew of Pacific Rowers was rescued by a USCG helicopter when their boat started to take on water after a few days at sea. One of the support vessels for the race had arrived at the scene but was unable to recover the crew due to the severe weather. The USCG rescue swimmer said it was, \"the most challenging rescue I've ever had.\"\nOf the thirteen crews that started the race, seven successfully made it to Honolulu. The winner of the race and the first fours team to ever row the Pacific was Team Uniting Nations comprising rowers from the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea and Great Britain. They completed the course in 43 days, 5 hours, and 30 minutes. Second place in the race was Team Battleborn who finished just 14 hours behind.\nThe fours team NOMAN finished in third place just ahead of the first pairs team, Fat Chance Row. Sami Inkinen and Meredith Loring of Fat Chance Row were rowing to promote the dangers of sugar in the diet and completed the row having had a diet primarily based on fats and proteins. The married couple, rowing in an open class row boat had completed the race in the second fastest time. Since they were not ready for the first start of the race on June 9, they started late and posted an official finish time of 53 days, 23 hours, and 43 minutes.\nThe remaining fours crews of Pacific Warriors and Boatylicious were approaching Hawaii as Hurricane Iselle became a threat. A race support yacht towed Pacific Warriors the final to O'ahu before returning to sea the next day to accompany Boatylicious in their final few miles to ensure they reached a safe harbor before the hurricane arrived. Both crews arrived safely at the Waikiki Yacht Club before the hurricane struck the island later that day.\nThe final boat to finish the initial Great Pacific Race was CC4 Pacific. Being several hundred miles behind Boatylicious, the French cousins aboard the classic pairs boat missed Hurricane Iselle but were asked by the race organizers to deploy their parachute anchor to prevent them from rowing into the path of Hurricane Julio which was close behind. CC4 Pacific encountered severe weather with winds in excess of and seas over . The boat never capsized and the pair completed the race in 75 days, 9 hours, and 25 minutes.\nThe only soloist remaining at sea after the first few weeks of the race, Elsa Hammond, and her boat Darien were recovered by one of the race's support yachts, far off course, south of Isla Guadalupe, Mexico after 52 days at sea.\n2016 race.\nThe fastest crossing westbound to Hawaii was set in 2016 by the winning team of Uniting Nations (Carlo Facchino, Fiann Paul, Cyril Derreumaux, and Thiago Silva) with a crossing time of 39 days, 9 hours, and 56 minutes, earning Fiann Paul the third of four overall speed records and the Guinness World Record for \"The first person to hold current speed records on four oceans.\"\nIn 2016, Erden Eruç rowed with Louis Bird, the son of Peter Bird, as a substitute for a race partner who had withdrawn for health reasons. They set the fastest time in the \"classic pair\" class, 54 days, 3 hours, and 45 minutes, finishing first among three boats in the same class.\nIndian Ocean rowing.\nThe Indian Ocean was first crossed by Anders Svedlund of Sweden in 1971. He set off from Kalbarri in Western Australia on 29 April 1971 and arrived near Diego Suarez, Madagascar, 64 days later on 23 June.\nSarah Outen, a 24-year-old Briton, left Fremantle, Western Australia on 1 April 2009. Rowing her boat \"Serendipity\", she arrived at Bois des Amourettes, Mauritius, 124 days later on 3 August. She became the first woman soloist to attempt and successfully complete the crossing.\nThe previous speed record for rowing the Indian Ocean was held by the 8 person crew of Audeamus ('Let Us Dare'), who took a little over 58 days to set the new record in 2009. The crew consisted of Bernard Fisset (Belgium); Doug Tuminello, Brian Flick and Angela Madsen (USA); and Helen Taylor, Ian Couch, Simon Chalk and Paul Cannon (UK).\nAudeamus is the first boat ever to row unassisted, land to land cross the Indian Ocean, landing just a few weeks ahead of \"Team MSS\". It is also the first, multi-person boat and the first mixed boat to row the Indian Ocean and the first 8-person boat to row any Ocean. All are Guinness World Records.\nHelen Taylor and Angela Madsen are the first women to row across the Indian Ocean, landing just a few weeks ahead of Sarah Outen. There are several other Guinness world records associated with the boat.\nThe first all female crew to cross the Indian Ocean left Australia, Geroldton on 19 April 2009 taking 78 days to cross the ocean coming second in the first ever 'Woodvale Indian Ocean Rowing Race'. The Ocean Angels (www.oceanangels.co.uk) supported Breast Cancer Care on their journey, consisting of Fiona Waller, Sarah Duff, Elin Davies and Joanna Jackson.\nOn 19 April 2009 Andrew Delaney and Guy Watts began their unsupported ocean row from Geraldton, Western Australia across the Indian Ocean to Mauritius. They set five world records and broke two race speed records. They were the first pair to row unassisted land to land across the Indian Ocean and they were winners of the ‘pair’s class’ in the inaugural Indian Ocean Rowing Race.\nFrom 13 July 2010 to 20 April 2011 Erden Eruç set four Guinness World Records for rowing on the Indian Ocean as part of his successful first solo human-powered circumnavigation, becoming the first person to row from mainland Australia to mainland Africa, completing the greatest distance rowed on the Indian Ocean from mainland Australia to Madagascar and across the Mozambique Channel to mainland Africaand the greatest distance rowed solo as well as the greatest distance rowed non-stop on the Indian Ocean from Australia to Madagascar.\nOn 5 August 2013, Maxime Chaya (Lebanon) and his two teammates Stuart Kershaw (England) and Livar Nysted (Faroe Islands) arrived in Mauritius 57 days, 15 hours, and 49 minutes with the average speed of 2.27 knots after setting off from Geraldton, Western Australia aboard rowboat tRIO. They set a new world speed record, beating the previous one set by an 8-person crew in 2009. In addition, the trio Chaya, Kershaw and Nysted became the first 3-man team to cross the Indian or any ocean.\nThe fastest crossing of the Indian Ocean was set in 2014 by a six-man crew aboard Avalon: (Leven Brown, Jamie Douglas-Hamilton, Tim Spiteri, Fiann Paul, Cameron Bellamy and Heather Rees-Gaunt) with a crossing time of 57 days from 10 hours and 58 mins from Geraldton, Australia to Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles with an average speed of 2.65 knots covering distance 600 nautical miles longer than the previous world record holders which calculates into approximately 10 days advantage over the previous record holders. The crew also set the record for the longest distance rowed by a crew. It was the second of 4 overall speed records allowing Fiann Paul to earn Guinness title of \"The first person to hold current speed records on 4 oceans\" in 2017.\nArctic Ocean rowing.\nPolar Row (composed of Polar Row I and Polar Row II) in total covered 1251 Nautical Miles measured in a straight line (1440 Miles or 2361 km) in the Arctic Ocean and pioneered ocean rowing routes from Tromsø to Longyearbyen, from Longyearbyen to the Arctic Ice Shelf (79'55'500 N) and from the Arctic Ice Shelf to Jan Mayen. They became the most record-breaking ocean row and the most record-breaking man-powered expedition, claiming over a dozen world records in total.\nPolar Row I: The fastest crossing of the Arctic Ocean was set in 2017 by a five-man crew aboard Polar Row I, (Fiann Paul, Tor Wigum, Tathagata Roy, Carlo Facchino, Jeff Willis) with a crossing time of 7 days and 7 hours, from Tromsø, Norway to Hornsund and next to Longyearbyen (additional 36h), Svalbard, with an average speed of 2,58 knots. In total they covered distance of 600 miles (521 nm) (965 km), breaking the existing Arctic Ocean overall speed record by 3,5 times. Polar Row I's triumph was the biggest record demolition in the history of Ocean Rowing. Arctic Ocean overall speed record was set higher than the Pacific Ocean overall speed record. Even more, it was the first recorded complete row across the Barents Sea. After this crossing captain Fiann Paul became the first person to row all 4 oceans. It was the 4th of 4 overall speed records claimed by Fiann Paul and upon this achievement he received Guinness Titles of: \"First to row 4 Oceans\" and \"First to hold current speed records on all 4 oceans\". The crew also broke the 27-years-standing record of Northernmost Latitude reached by a rowing vessel.\nPolar Row II: In Longyearbyen 3 of the 5 crew members were replaced and one new member joined, forming the 6 man team of Polar Row II. The new rowers were Danny Longman, Alex Gregory, Samuel Vie and Tyler Carnevale. The crew rowed North to the Arctic Ice Shelf, reaching the northernmost latitude attained by a rowing vessel. The crew then turned South, to continue on their journey to Iceland. Heavy weather and equipment failure lead to a decision to change course, with the crew arriving safely in Jan Mayen under their own power. On Jan Mayen four of the six crew members decided they would not continue to Iceland for health reasons. Captain Fiann Paul and Carlo Facchino aimed to continue to Iceland which was an additional 350 nautical miles south.\nFiann organized Team Polar Row III (Fiann Paul, Carlo Facchino, James Plumley, Arnar Már Árnason, Gísli Hjartarson, Yngvi Yngvason) and attempted to have 4 new rowers transported to Jan Mayen by a private plane from Iceland, but the airplane didn't receive the landing permit due to military restrictions on Jan Mayen. After multiple attempts of trying to solve the logistics Fiann declared the expedition finished in Jan Mayen. Fiann Paul and Carlo Facchino became the first people to row the Arctic Ocean both directions.\nCircumnavigation of Britain.\nIn 2005, four British army officers rowed around Great Britain in 26 days. Guinness World Records designated their effort as \"fastest unsupported row circumnavigating UK mainland waters\". In 2008 and 2009, the challenge was independently attempted again, each ending in failure.\nIn 2010, Sir Richard Branson sponsored the inaugural multi boat race, called Virgin GB Row 2010. Four crews entered but only two made it through rigorous scrutiny to the Start line. The men's crew in \"Orca\" were forced to retire as the boat lost its anchor at Wolf Rock, off Lands End, leaving the ladies crew to complete the race in 51 days, setting a world record as the fastest unsupported female four to complete the entire challenge, starting and finishing at Tower Bridge in London. The all female crew was composed of Belinda Kirk, 35, from Bristol, Royal Navy nurse Laura Thomasson, 23, from Kent, IT support manager Beverley Ashton, 29, from Oxfordshire, and former US Marine Angela Madsen, 50 from Long Beach, California, rowing \"Go Commando\". In 2010, two Army doctors, Nick Dennison and Hamish Reid, circumnavigated Britain in a single journey in an ocean rowing boat. The pair started and finished in Lymington, and completed the journey in 50 days and 5 hours.\nOn 1 June 2013, 6 boats set off for the honours of World Records plus a chance at winning £100,000 to the first boat to beat the fastest time world record.\nIn 2018 Andrew Hodgson became the first person to row solo around Great Britain in a time of 175 days 2 hours and 51 minutes in his boat \"Spirit of Ahab\".\nSouthern Ocean rowing.\nA boat captained by Fiann Paul crossed the Drake Passage from Cape Horn to the Antarctic Peninsula in December 2019. The six-man crew also included first mate Colin O'Brady, Cameron Bellamy, Andrew Towne, Jamie Douglas-Hamilton, and John Petersen. The row was the first entirely human-powered crossing of the Southern Ocean, taking 12 days, 1 hour, and 45 minutes.\nMediterranean Sea Rowing.\nA biennial series of ocean rowing races in the Mediterranean Sea between Barcelona and Ibiza began in 2013. Organised by the NOMAN is an Island: Race to End HPV Campaign the record is held by Team Monex Europe, who completed the crossing of the Balearic Sea in 54h30 minutes in July 2019."

        "title": "National Ice Hockey League",
        "text": "The National Ice Hockey League (NIHL) is a set of semi-professional ice hockey leagues administered by the English Ice Hockey Association. It is currently the second tier of British ice hockey, below the Elite Ice Hockey League. Formerly called the English National Ice Hockey League (ENIHL), it was renamed in 2012 to recognise the inclusion of several teams from Scotland and Wales.\nThe English Ice Hockey Association announced a new structure of the men's senior league for the 2019/20 season, at a meeting of NIHL clubs in Warwickshire. A new ten-team division was approved to sit above the existing Division 1 in North and South, to be known as the National League.\nIn the inaugural 2019–2020 season the National League comprised Basingstoke Bison, Bracknell Bees, Hull Pirates, Leeds Knights, MK Lightning, Peterborough Phantoms, Romford Raiders, Sheffield Steeldogs, Swindon Wildcats and Telford Tigers. There is no promotion to or relegation from the National League.\nBelow the National League, the leagues are split into two regions, North and South, meaning teams do not have to travel long distances for away games. Each region has 2 divisions, with promotion and relegation between the divisions in each region.\nHistory.\nThe ENIHL was formed in 1996; following the dissolution of the British Hockey League (BHL), and the creation of the Ice Hockey Superleague and the British National League (BNL) as the top two tiers of British hockey. The ENIHL served as the third tier of hockey; operating below the BNL.\nTiers of British ice hockey since 1995.\nFollowing its inaugural season, an upper tier within the ENIHL was founded, so as to serve as a league for the members of the BNL who could not afford to remain in that league due to the increased operating costs; but at the same time played ice hockey to a higher standard that of the other ENIHL teams. This division was originally known as the National Division, and during the 1997–98 season the teams in this division played dual schedules; a series of games solely amongst themselves, and another amongst all of the teams which fell under the jurisdiction of the ENIHL at this time. Solihull Blaze won the league and play-off trophies of both formats during this inaugural season.\nAt the start of the 1998–99 season the divisions, whilst still both under the ENIHL umbrella, performed in their own separate competitions; and the national division adopted the name Premier Division, and later on became known as the Premier League. By the end of the season the league had established itself outside of the ENIHL as the English Premier Ice Hockey League (EPIHL); reducing the ENIHL to the fourth level of Britain's ice hockey pyramid.\nHowever, in 2005 the BNL disbanded; leaving the EPIHL to take its place as the second tier of the national game and, consequently, re-establishing the ENIHL as the third tier of British ice hockey. In April 2007, the EIHA lowered the upper age limit within the junior leagues, abolishing the under 19 age limit to become under 18. Due to the large gap from junior level to the EPIHL, many teams were forced to enter a reserve team into the ENIHL. This increased the size of the league from 22 teams through to 30 teams for the 2007–08 season. Later in the 2007 off-season, the EIHA suggested introducing an under 25 age limit across the league. However, this age limit was removed within weeks in favour of a drive towards developing players. The ENIHL was restructured for the 2008/2009 season into two regional divisions North and South, with two leagues in each regional division.\nFollowing the 2012–13 the league was renamed the National Ice Hockey League, removing the word English due to non-English teams participating. In 2013, it was agreed at the EIHA AGM to restructure the Northern league into two conferences; Moralee and Laidler. The split was done primarily on regions and neither conference was regarded as being higher than the other. However, at the following year's AGM, it was agreed to return to a tiered Division 1 and Division 2 format. However, the conference names remained in place with Division 1 taking the Moralee Conference title and Division 2 the Laidler Conference title.\nIn 2014, it was agreed at the EIHA AGM to restructure the Southern Division 2 league to have Western and Eastern Conferences. Due to the odd-number of teams in the league, the Eastern Conference had six teams while the Western Conference had five teams. Both conferences were run completely separately and each winner was only regarded as being the conference winner, with no implication of one conference winner being regarded as the league winner. A two-round playoff format was introduced at the end of the season to determine a league-wide winner. The winner of the playoffs would then be the team promoted to Division 1. In 2017, the two conferences were reunited.\nPlayers.\nThe league itself is considered to be a development league, and as such the players are normally amateur. Many teams have affiliate teams in higher leagues. Other teams are aligned with junior ice hockey clubs, and exist to ensure that when players hit 18 there is still a possibility for them to play competitive hockey if they have not joined a professional team.\nThe system.\nNational League.\nNote the Basingstoke Bison announced they would sit out the 2023/24 season due to rink upgrade works.\nSeason structure.\nAs of the 2018–19 season, the divisions are the following:\nNorth.\nEach team plays each of the other teams in their league a total of four times; twice home, twice away.\nAt the end of the regular season, the top 4 teams in the division take part in the Playoff weekend, which are one-off games, replacing the previous home/away format. There is not usually a third placed Playoff. Blackburn Hawks currently hold the record of most consecutive final appearances with four from 2011/12 to the present season, winning in 2012/13 and 2014/15.\nThe rules regarding promotion and relegation between the Moralee and Laidler regularly change.\nThere are occasional cup competitions, but the format changes in most seasons but usually takes part in a league format.\nSouth.\nEach team plays each of the other teams in their league a total of four times; twice home, twice away.\nUnlike the North, the South keep a two-legged home-and-away format throughout the playoffs. In Division 1, this is a three-rounded format, involving the teams who finished in the top 8 of the regular season. In Division 2, this is a two-rounded format, involving the teams who finished in the top 2 of their conference. In the semi-finals, the conference winners play the runners-up from the other conference with the final involving the winners of the two semi-finals.\nDivision 1 has a Cup competition involving six of the teams. These are initially split into two groups of three, with the top two from each group going on to a knock-out, two-legged semi-final and final.\nDivision 2 has a Cup competition involving eight teams. These are initially split into two groups of four, with each group containing two teams from each conference. The top two teams from each group go onto a single Cup Final Weekend held in a single venue, with semi-finals on the Saturday determining the two teams to play the final on the Sunday.\nLeague champions.\nIn 2019, the EIHA announced a new National League to sit above the existing regional leagues. This mainly comprised the teams of the former EPIHL that had dropped into NIHL Division 1 in 2017. The competition Champions are as follows:\nRules.\nFollows International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) rules, as used by countries in all major European leagues. There are significant differences between the National Hockey League rules and IIHF rules, including rink dimension, netminder puck handling, and icing.\nThe ENIHL also operates under additional EIHA regulations.\nAdditional discipline rules are also enforced by the EIHA, which include;"

        "title": "1982 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1982 Tour de France was the 69th edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 2 to 25 July. The total race distance was 22 stages over . It was won by Bernard Hinault, his fourth victory so far.\nTeams.\nIn response to the finish of the 1981 Tour de France, French minister of sports Edwige Avice objected to the amount of advertising in the race, and suggested the Tour to return to the national team format. The Tour organisation needed the money brought in by the sponsors, and no changes were made to the team structure.\nThe Tour organisation decided to start with 17 teams, each with 10 cyclists, for a total of 170, a new record. Tour director Félix Lévitan suggested to reduce the number of cyclists by starting with teams of 9 cyclists, but this was rejected. Teams could submit a request to join until 15 May 1982. To promote cycling in the United States of America, the American national cycling team would automatically be accepted, but the American team made no request.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nHinault, who had won the Tour in 1978, 1979 and 1981, and left the 1980 Tour in leading position, was the clear favourite for the victory. In those other years, Hinault had won several races before the Tour, but in 1982 he had only won one major race, the 1982 Giro d'Italia. Hinault tried to be the fourth cyclist, after Fausto Coppi, Jacques Anquetil and Eddy Merckx, to win the Giro-Tour double.\nNotable absent was Lucien Van Impe, who was second in the 1981 Tour de France, winning the mountains classification. Since the 1969 Tour de France, Van Impe had started each edition, winning the general classification in the 1976 Tour and the mountains classification five times. Van Impe wanted to join, but his team Metauro was not invited, as the organisation considered it not strong enough to ride both the Giro and the Tour. Van Impe tried to find a team to hire him only for the 1982 Tour, but was not successful.\nEven though Joop Zoetemelk was 35 years old and no longer considered a favourite, he still managed to finish in second place, for the sixth time and final time.\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1982 Tour de France started on 2 July, and had two rest days, in Lille and Martigues. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Alpe d'Huez climb on stage 16.\nRace overview.\nThe Prologue was won by Hinault who finished seven seconds faster than Gerrie Knetemann. In stage 1 Ludo Peeters escaped to win the stage by 0:38 over the main field leaving Sean Kelly and Jan Raas to sprint for 2nd place and in conjunction with the time bonus for winning the stage, Peeters moved into the overall lead by 0:14 over Hinault. Stage 2 included a rare climb up the Ballon d'Alsace in northeastern France, which was a popular climb in the 1930s TDF editions, but this was only the 3rd time it had been included in the route since World War II. Bernard Vallet would attack the climb for the KOM points but Phil Anderson would win the stage and for the second year in a row don the yellow jersey for at least a day. Vallet moved into 2nd 0:38 behind Anderson as Peeters fell to third and Hinault ended up in 7th nearly a minute down strangely setting the stage for a repeat of the surprise from the year before, when Anderson became a challenger to Hinault in a similar manner to Cyrille Guimard becoming the only realistic challenger to Eddy Merckx during the 1972 Tour de France.\nStage's 3 and 4 were won by Daniel Willems and Gerrie Knetemann who would each win the final two stages of their TDF careers in 1982. In the Points Competition Sean Kelly took command of the green jersey having been competitive in the sprints, would not relinquish it the rest of the Tour and due to time bonuses he moved into 2nd place overall. Stage 5 was a TTT that began no different than any other Team Time Trial but during the stage angry ironworkers from the Usinor steel company blocked the road and interrupted the stage to the point it had to be postponed.\nStage 6 was won by Raas handily, leaving Jos Jacobs and Pierre La Bigaut to sprint for 2nd five seconds later and Stage 7 was decided in a sprint finish by Pol Verschuere.\nStage 8 was a circuit finish with fifteen laps of a 6 km course planned in the city of Châteaulin. French rider Régis Clère devised a plan to escape the Peloton and arrive in town far ahead of the other riders in an attempt to question whether or not it would be legally within the rules to arrive on the circuit and complete the first lap and then follow in the slipstream of the main field once they arrived on the circuit and coast his way to victory riding at the back of the pack. Unfortunately for Clère, even though at one point he had built up about a ten-minute gap, he would end up getting a flat tire and then suffer a mechanical costing him so much time that the main field would catch him before he reached town and following the laps around the circuit Frank Hoste would end up out sprinting Claude Criquielion and Bruno Leali in a bunch finish.\nStage 9A was the TTT originally scheduled as stage 5 and Tour organizers decided to have the riders actual times only count towards the general classification in the overall team race as individually riders were awarded time bonuses. As a result, Anderson remained in the overall lead but due to the strong 2nd-place finish of Team Renault–Elf–Gitane Hinault was now in 2nd place just 0:28 off the lead. Winning the stage was the consistently dominant TI–Raleigh–Campagnolo–Merckx squad who caused Kelly, Clére, Willems and Vallet to each drop in the standings as Raleigh now had four riders in the Top 10 overall with Johan van der Velde being their primary GC contender now sitting in 8th place at 1:53 behind. The originally scheduled Stage 9 was now Stage 9B and was won by Stefan Mutter who crossed the line 0:58 ahead of 2nd place Pierre-Raymond Villemiane and had more than a minute advantage over the main field. In Stage 10 Villemiane would win the stage, besting the likes of Kelly, Raas and Eddy Planckaert by two seconds as the overall situation remained the same going into the ITT prior to the start of high mountain stages in the Pyrenees.\nThe individual time trial in Stage 11 was won by Gerrie Knetemann who beat Hinault by 0:18. The last time Knetemann had beaten Hinault in a TDF ITT was in the Prologue of the 1979 Tour de France, although since that time Knetemann was among the very few riders able to ride individually at the same level as Hinault having come within 0:30 of The Badger of five occasions and just ten seconds on three occasions. Aside from Hinault out of the 125+ riders still in the Tour at this point only Jan van Houwelingen, Joop Zoetemelk and Daniel Willems finished within 2:30 of Knetemann's time. Phil Anderson finished more than 3:00 back falling to 3rd place in the overall standings meaning he was now more than 2:00 behind the new overall leader Hinault. The sportswriters were correctly beginning to fear that Hinault was going to run away with his 4th Tour victory as 2nd place Knetemann was not considered an overall threat to the yellow jersey and aside from Anderson in 3rd the only other rider remotely close to Hinault was the now 7th placed Zoetemelk, who might have given Hinault one of his only serious challenges between 1978 and 1980, but at this point Zoetemelk was pushing 36 years old, was one of the oldest riders in the peloton and admitted, just as he had in his very first Tour back in the 1970 Tour de France against Merckx, that he was up against the greatest rider in the world and was only riding to beat everybody else.\nStage 12 would be the first high mountain and therefore bring clarity to the overall situation, which included a climb of the Col d'Aubisque. Sean Kelly survived with the elite riders and was therefore able to win the stage by out sprinting Anderson and Van de Velde at the finish. Zoetemelk, Vallet and Hinault also came across in good order with Hinault leading 2nd place Anderson by 2:03, Zoetemelk by 4:26 and everybody else by well over 5:00. Stage 13 included the Col d'Aspin and was won by Swiss rider Beat Breu who soloed across the finish ahead of the GC riders by 0:35 starting with Robert Alban in 2nd. Hinault kept Zoetemelk close all day and crossed five seconds ahead of him as Anderson and Van der Velde were each dropped and lost about a minute apiece.\nFollowing the rest day before immediately going to the French Alps was another individual time trial, which this time was won by Bernard Hinault who only had Houwelingen, Vallet, Zoetemelk and Daniel Gisiger finish within a minute of him as he now lead everybody in the overall situation by more than 5:00. Stage 15 was won by Pascal Simon who was just able to stay away from Pierre-Henri Menthéour to take the stage as Hinault, even though he finished outside the top 10 on the stage, now had everyone except for Zoetemelk getting close to, or already beyond a 10:00 deficit. Stage 16 included the famed climb Alpe d'Huez and was almost a repeat in the top 5 from stage 13 with Beat Breu winning the day, and Alban, Alberto Fernández and Raymond Martin being the next riders to cross the finish. Hinault came across comfortably in 5th with Zoetemelk and Peter Winnen accompanying him. Stage 17 was won by Winnen, who moved into 3rd place overall 7:13 behind Hinault who kept Zoetemelk marked all day and lead the elite riders across the line some two and a half minutes after Winnen methodically hammering out the final kilometres in the mountains with his 4th Tour victory in five years all but assured. Also on this stage Bernard Vallet ended up being dropped by the GC favorites and fell out of the top 10 overall, but he had gained enough points in the King of the Mountains competition to assure himself of the victory over Jean-René Bernaudeau meaning as long as he finished the final few stages he would be wearing the Polka Dot Jersey on the podium in Paris.\nIn stage 18 Adri van Houwelingen won the day by surviving a solo breakaway finishing 10:31 ahead of the rest of the field.\nStage 19 was the final time trial of the Tour and without much drama in the air the stage was won by Hinault with Gerrie Knetemann :09 behind him. As a result, the final overall standings seemed to be in place with Anderson in 5th, Winnen falling back to 4th, Van der Velde jumping up to 3rd with Hinault and Zoetemelk remaining 1st and 2nd respectively. Stage 20 was a sprint finish won by Daniel Willems and going into the final stage on the Champs-Élysées many in the press had accused Hinault of riding a boring race, even though he was about to become a four time Tour de France champion.\nHinault responded by risking crashing and getting injured by getting to the front of the pack once the race hit the circuit finish on the Champs-Élysées where he was able to out sprint the likes of Yvon Bertin, former Green Jersey winner Rudy Pevenage, a surprising Paul Sherwen, Fons de Wolf and everybody else dreaming of glory to seize the biggest sprinter's stage of them all.\nOn the final podiums in Paris the Most Combative Rider award went to Régis Clère, the Polka Dot Jersey was won by Bernard Vallet, the Points Competition was won by Sean Kelly, which he would win three more times in his career, the Best Young Rider was won by Phil Anderson ahead of Kim Andersen and Marc Madiot and the Team Competition was won by Coop–Mercier–Mavic. In 3rd place on the overall podium was Johan van der Velde, in 2nd place for 6th and final time, setting a record that will likely never be equaled was Joop Zoetemelk, who also set a record for his 11th Top 5 finish and joining the likes of Coppi, Anquetil and Merckx by winning the Giro-Tour double was Bernard Hinault.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were several classifications in the 1982 Tour de France, four of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, where cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either \"hors catégorie\", first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\nAnother classification was the young rider classification. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only cyclists under 24 were eligible, and the leader wore a white jersey.\nThe fifth individual classification was the intermediate sprints classification. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but only points were awarded on intermediate sprints. In 1982, this classification had no associated jersey.\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification were identified by yellow caps. There was also a team points classification. Cyclists received points according to their finishing position on each stage, with the first rider receiving one point. The first three finishers of each team had their points combined, and the team with the fewest points led the classification. The riders of the team leading this classification wore green caps.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass-start stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. Régis Clère won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col d'Aubisque on stage 12. This prize was won by Beat Breu.\nIn the 1981 Tour de France, Urs Freuler, Eddy Planckaert and Walter Planckaert had left the race before the Alps. The Tour organisers did not want this to happen again, so in 1982, cyclists were not allowed to leave the Tour without a good reason. A cyclist that left the Tour unauthorized would lose all the prize money that he won so far, receive a fine, and would not be allowed to join the next year.\nAftermath.\nHinault's victory in 1982 is considered as the most effortless Tour victory in his career.\nDuring the 1982 Tour de France, the Tour organisation was impressed by the global audience that the 1982 FIFA World Cup reached, and they made plans to develop the Tour into a World Cup format, run every four years, where teams from all over the earth would compete against each other. The main part of the race would be in France, but more other countries would be visited; it was discussed to start the Tour in New York.\nThe 1983 Tour de France was still run in the familiar format in France, but it was open to amateur teams, although only one Colombian accepted the invitation."

Instead of a standard golf ball, players may use leather balls, plastic golf balls, or tennis balls. It may be played on the street as well as in industrial brownfields, sand pits, parks, rooftops, and river banks, among others.\nUrban golf started being widely played in 1992, when German golfer Torsten Schilling started the Natural Born Golfers group in Hamburg.

He previously played for the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, the Leigh Centurions and the Wests Tigers.\nHas many a nickname.\nBackground.\nBrown was born in Sutherland, New South Wales, Australia.\nPlaying career.\nBrown began playing junior rugby league for his local club side the Gymea Gorillas. He went to school at Endeavour Sports High School in the Sutherland Shire, working his way up through the age groups and representing the school at fullback in their back to back Arrive Alive Cup tournament wins.\nWhile attending Endeavour, Brown played for the Australian Schoolboys team in 2005.\nCronulla-Sutherland Sharks.\nAt the beginning of the 2006 NRL season, many pundits earmarked Brown as playing a major part in the Sharks new season campaign. However, for the majority of the season, Brown had to settle for playing in the lower grades for the Cronulla side after being behind David Simmons in the order for the spot and both Darren Albert and Luke Covell on the wings. His chance didn't come until late in the season with the dropping of Darren Albert allowing Brown to make his debut on the wing for the Sharks.\n2007 was a successful season for Brown, as he played in 14 of the 24 first games for the Sharks. An injury to fullback Brett Kearney early in the season gave Brown the opportunity at his preferred position of fullback. In 2008, Brown had limited opportunities as Brett Kearney played the majority of the season.\nDuring the 2009 season, Brown played the majority of his games at fullback, due to Brett Kearney's season-ending injury towards the start of the season. On 17 July, Brown signed with the Wests Tigers for 2010 and 2011.\nWests Tigers.\nBrown was left out of the Wests Tigers side for the first games of the 2010 NRL season, but injuries to players like Tim Moltzen saw him make 20 appearances throughout season, and he was chosen as fullback for all three of the club's final matches. Noted for his versatility, Brown made 20 appearances in 2011, playing wing and centre when the Wests Tigers suffered long injuries to Chris Lawrence and Lote Tuqiri. Having started the 2012 season with the Wests Tigers, Brown was released to join Canterbury Bulldogs after round one. Tigers CEO Stephen Humphreys said, \"he felt he needed to position himself somewhere where he could secure a starting spot. His preferred position is centre.\"\nCanterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs.\nAn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) knee injury early in the 2012 season saw him play no games that year.\nPlaying all but one game on the wing in 2013, Brown scored 12 tries from 24 appearances, both personal bests. In round 7, playing against old club Cronulla, Brown scored his first ever double. He went on the score another two doubles before the end of the year.\nBrown was on the wing again in 2014, apart from a 4-week stint at fullback when Sam Perrett was unavailable. He played in all four of the Bulldogs post-season games, including the grand final which they lost 30–6 against South Sydney.\nReturn to Cronulla.\nBrown returned to Cronulla for the 2015 season, saying, \"I've lived here my whole life, I've never moved, I just travelled. I've been a Sharks supporter since I can remember and I was born in Sutherland Hospital so I'm a Shire boy through and through. I've always supported the Sharks and I always wanted to come back when I left. I'm the only local junior apart from Anthony Moratis.\"\nAfter being chosen on the wing for the first game of the season, Brown made just one further appearance for the 2015 season after being dropped due to poor form.\nHe joined the Leigh Centurions part way through the 2016 season. In November 2017 he signed a one-year deal with Warrington Wolves."

        "text": "How to Play Baseball is a cartoon produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by RKO Radio Pictures in September 1942, featuring Goofy. The short was produced at the request of Samuel Goldwyn and first shown to accompany the 1942 feature film \"The Pride of the Yankees\".\nPlot.\nGoofy takes the time to demonstrate America's national pastime, then plays a game - one in which he plays all the bases. The short describes the basics of baseball in humorous terms; the equipment, uniforms, positions, and pitches, as well as the mannerisms of the players. It then switches to a game in progress, a deciding game in the World Series between the fictional Blue Sox and Gray Sox (possibly a parody of the real-life Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox). The Blue Sox are up three runs and working a no-hitter when the Grays rally in the bottom of the ninth. In a series of events the Grays load the bases, leading to a base clearing hit.\nThe game is tied, but the play at the plate is too close to call for the umpire, and it then ends in an argument. They unmask the umpire (yet another Goofy!) and the other players attack the three. The narrator then concludes the short praising the values of what makes baseball America's sport.\nProduction.\nThis is the first of Disney's \"How to...\" shorts starring Goofy. The short was made on a rushed schedule of 12 weeks so it could be released in time to accompany Samuel Goldwyn's \"The Pride of the Yankees\". It was followed by nine \"How to...\" shorts in Walt Disney's lifetime: \"How to Swim\" and \"How to Fish\" (both also in 1942); \"How to Be a Sailor\", \"How to Play Football\", and \"How to Play Golf\" (1944); \"How to Ride a Horse\" (1950, originally included in \"The Reluctant Dragon\" in 1941); \"How to Be a Detective\" (1952); and \"How to Sleep\" and \"How to Dance\" (both 1953).\nAfter Disney's death, the studio produced \"How to Haunt a House\" (1999) and \"How to Hook Up Your Home Theater\" (2007). Similarly-styled Goofy shorts that do not include the \"How to\" titling convention are \"The Olympic Champ\" (1942), \"Hockey Homicide\" (1945), \"Goofy Gymnastics\" (1949) and \"Motor Mania\" (1950). Prior to \"How to Play Baseball\", Disney had released two other \"instructional\" shorts starring Goofy: \"The Art of Skiing\" and \"The Art of Self Defense\" in November and December 1941, respectively.\nReception.\nBosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" called it \"deliciously confused ... goofy burlesque\".\n\"The Film Daily\" wrote: \"With a serious world looking forward to the World Series, that incomparable master of animated humor, Walt Disney, comes forward with one of his most side-splitting subjects... The footage was especially created by Disney to accompany Samuel Goldwyn's RKO Radio powerhouse, \"The Pride of the Yankees\"... Exhibs. will be figurative namesakes of Goofy if they don't book this one.\"\nHome media.\nThe short was released on December 2, 2002 on \"\".\nAdditional releases include:"

They also participated in the Inter-Colonial Tournament between Barbados, British Guiana (formerly Demerara), and themselves, playing in all 28 tournaments that were held between 1891–92 and 1938–39. From the late 1880s, Tobago was incorporated into the crown colony of Trinidad as a ward.\nAfter independence in 1962, the team changed its name to reflect the official name of the country, Trinidad and Tobago, and when the Shell Shield began in 1965–66 the team competed under the name of Trinidad and Tobago. They won their first title on their fourth outing, in 1969–70, and also won the next year's competition, but since then Trinidad and Tobago have only taken three titles in 35 seasons. During this time cricketers from Trinidad competed in the Beaumont Cup which had first class status.\nTrinidad and Tobago won four one day titles in eight seasons from 1989–90 to 1996–97 and another four in six seasons from 2004–05 to 2009-10. As well they won consecutive titles in the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons with yet another title in the 2020-21 season.

        "title": "The French Connection (ice hockey)",
        "text": "The French Connection is the nickname of a forward line that played for the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League from 1972 until 1979. The line consisted of Hall of Famer Gilbert Perreault at centre and All-Stars Rick Martin and René Robert at left wing and right wing, respectively. All three players were French-Canadians from Quebec: Perreault from Victoriaville; Robert from Trois-Rivières; and Martin from Verdun. The name referred both to the origins of the players and to the 1971 movie \"The French Connection\", based upon the book of the same name.\nPerreault and Martin were the first-round draft picks of the Sabres in the franchise's first two years, while Robert was acquired in a trade late in the Sabres' second season. The trio accounted for most of Buffalo's scoring during their seven years together, amassing a total of 1,681 points over 1,536 man-games from 1972 to 1979,\nwhile leading the Sabres to the franchise's first appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals in 1975. They continue to hold many of the franchise's scoring records. Each member of the French Connection was named to the official NHL All-Star team at least once and to the National Hockey League All-Star Game at least twice while playing together. \nHistory.\nPerreault was acquired by the team with their first draft pick of their inaugural season in the 1970 Entry Draft. Martin followed the next year as the team's first pick in 1971. Both players were drafted after three seasons with the Montreal Junior Canadiens. Robert was acquired in a trade on March 4, 1972, for Eddie Shack. He played twelve games for the Sabres during the 1971–72 NHL season. Perreault played his entire 17-season career with the Sabres. Martin played all but 4 games of his injury-shortened 11-season career with the Sabres. The trio played together as a line most of the time until the fall of 1979. On October 5, 1979, Scotty Bowman traded Robert to the Colorado Rockies for defenseman John Van Boxmeer. This ended the French Connection era in Buffalo, but not before the trio became the first three players to accumulate 200 goals in a Sabres uniform. Each player's jerseys were retired; Perreault's #11 was retired during a ceremony on October 17, 1990, and Robert's #14 and Martin's #7 were retired on November 15, 1995. All three numbers hang together from the KeyBank Center rafters under a French Connection banner.\nIn hopes of averting the lean years that troubled most expansion teams, George Imlach, the Sabres first coach and General Manager, attempted to build a high-scoring club to excite the local hockey fans. Perreault was regarded as a smooth skater and tremendous stickhandler. Perreault was chosen to be the franchise player around which a team could be built and succeed. Although Martin and Perreault had played two years together with the Montreal Junior Canadiens (Perreault even lived with Martin's family during the 1969–70 season), they had never played on the same line before being paired in Buffalo. Since Martin was one of the few who could keep up with Perreault as a skater they were paired together after the Sabres drafted Martin. It was very clear during the 1971–72 season that Perreault and Martin were a natural pairing. Sabres coach Joe Crozier felt the two just needed a third player who would stay high and check. Sabres coach quickly teamed Robert with Perreault and Martin after the trade. The two players complemented Perreault and became a dynamic combination that dazzled fans.\nThere are differing claims as to who dubbed the hockey line “The French Connection” as a reference to the Academy Award-winning film. Origination of the term was often given to writer Lee Coppola when he was operating the Buffalo Auditorium message board and who later became Dean of Journalism at St. Bonaventure University. Credit is also given to WKBW TV's Rick Azar, the Dean of TV sportscasters in Buffalo, who used it first on a 6pm Eyewitness News sportscast and references it in his 2014 book, Tales from Azar's Attic. A half century later, Erik Brady, in his July 22, 2021, Buffalo News column on who first named the French Connection line, suggested “maybe the answer is both, independent of one another.”\nThe trio played together as a regular line through the 1974–75 season. At times, they were split up during the last four seasons. When they played together they often faced the opposition's top defensive lineups. Since the trio were tremendous skating scoring threats these opponents would concentrate on checking them and staying on top of them. For example, against the Montreal Canadiens Bob Gainey's line would oppose them. Rick Martin once said about this line \"I had Jimmy Roberts between me and my shadow.\"\nPerreault was known as a naturally gifted skater and playmaker who was capable of making an end-to-end rush at any time. His fame was hampered by his own shy personality. His stickhandling and head faking confounded even the best defensive players in the world. Martin was considered the \"marksman\" of the three who was dangerous with the wristshot and slapshot. Robert was known for his \"blinding speed and lethal shot\". He made his mark with the French Connection, as one of the league's most highly regarded powerplay point men, and on the second line penalty killing unit. He was perhaps the least flashy of the three, but was the most complete. He was the player who checked and worked hard in the corners.\nPerreault holds numerous club career records (including regular season games played, goals, assists, points, game-winning goals, 30-goal seasons, 20-goal seasons, and shots on goal). However, Martin holds the franchise career records for hat tricks, four-goal games, 40-goal seasons, consecutive 40-goal seasons, 50-goal seasons (tied with Danny Gare) and consecutive 50-goal seasons. Although Robert's name is not as prominent in the record books. his 40-goal and 60-assist 1974–75 NHL season was the club's first 100-point season by an individual. During the seven full seasons the trio was together, Perreault led the Sabres in scoring five times and Robert and Martin led the team once each. Martin led the team three times in goals, Perreault twice and Robert once during this time. Perreault led the team in assists four times and Robert did so twice. In addition, the two tied once for the lead in assists. Martin's 1975–76 season with 7 hat tricks continues to be tied with Alexander Mogilny for the franchise single-season record. Martin and Perreault continue to be first and second for rookie season points and goals in franchise history (records set before the arrival of Robert).\nThe trio led the Sabres to the Stanley Cup playoffs every full season they were together, except the 1973–74 NHL season when Perreault suffered a broken leg and only played in 55 games. The impact of the combination was obvious as the team began the first full season of the French Connection era with a ten-game unbeaten streak; the team made the playoffs for the first time in the history of the franchise and the three members of the French Connection were the team's three leading scorers. The team suddenly went unbeaten in their first 21 home games, while setting a record for post 1967 expansion teams by recording a home winning streak of 12 and while going unbeaten in New York state for 25 games including 1 win at the Nassau Coliseum and 3 at the Madison Square Garden. Their first playoff appearance during their first full season together (1972–73) was not only the franchise's first playoff appearance, but the series also marked history as the only National Hockey League Playoff series with brothers (Ken Dryden and Dave Dryden) as opposing goaltenders. In the first game of the series, both goaltenders were chosen as being among the three stars of the game. During the 1974–75 NHL season, all members of the trio were selected to play in the National Hockey League All-Star game; they all finished among the top ten in league scoring, and they led the team to a tie for first place in the regular season standings.\nAmong their postseason highlights was the May 20, 1975, game three of the 1975 Stanley Cup Finals. This game, known as the fog game, was memorable because Buffalo Memorial Auditorium had no air conditioning and the arena temperature matched the 90 degree outdoor temperature, which caused fog to shroud the ice surface. During the overtime, play was delayed seven times due to fog on the ice surface at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. The players were instructed by Flyer coach Fred Shero and Sabre coach Floyd Smith to shoot whenever possible because of the impaired goaltender vision. Eventually, the French connection combined to score a Martin to Perreault to Robert game-winning goal. This came after the French Connection swarmed Flyer goalie enabling Bill Hajt to knock in a Rick Martin rebound to send the game to overtime.\nThe 1975–76 season would also be memorable for the trio and the franchise. On January 4, 1976, the Sabres hosted part of the two-team eight-game NHL tour by the opposing the Soviet Wings. The Sabres handed the Russians the first of only two defeats on the tour. The French Connection contributed 4 goals and 5 assists to a 12–6 victory. The night marked the worst defeat by a Russian hockey team in international competition.\nThe trio was, and remains, immensely popular in Buffalo, New York, as well as the surrounding Western New York area, and their international popularity and cultural prominence was also evident. They never won a Stanley Cup, but are an important part of hockey history. Rick Martin was the 1977 National Hockey League All-Star Game most valuable player and Perreault scored the game-winning overtime goal in the 1978 NHL All-Star Game at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. Perreault was selected to play in nine All-Star games (1970–71, 1971–72, 1973–74, 1974–75, 1976–77, 1977–78, 1978–79, 1979–80, 1983–84), Martin was selected to play in seven consecutive All-Star games (1971–72 through 1977–78) and Robert was selected to two All-Star games (1972–73, 1974–75). In addition, Martin was selected as the Official NHL All-Star first team Left Wing in 1973–74 &amp; 1974–75 and the Official NHL All-Star second team Left Wing in 1975–76 &amp; 1976–77. Perreault was selected as the Official NHL All-Star second team Center in 1975–76 &amp; 1976–77. Rene Robert was selected as the Official NHL All-Star second team Right Wing in 1974–75. Perreault earned the Calder Memorial Trophy in 1971 and the Lady Byng Trophy in 1973. All honours for all players were as Buffalo Sabres. All Official NHL All-Star team selections were earned while the three were teammates. Perreault was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1990.\nThe line made occasional appearances as members of the Buffalo Sabres Alumni Hockey Team until Martin's death in March 2011. Their last appearance together was to introduce Terrence Pegula as the Sabres' owner on February 24, 2011. A statue of \"The French Connection,\" unveiled in 2012, is located outside the Sabres' arena, now known as KeyBank Center."

He played college football played for the Auburn Tigers. He played for four teams in the NFL, earning all four of his Pro Bowl selections with the Cincinnati Bengals.\nHigh school and college career.\nBrooks led the Warner Robins High School Demons to both state and national championships in 1976. He graduated with the school record for rushing, a record that stood until Willie Reid broke his record years later. Brooks played college football at Auburn University from 1977 until 1980 and earned All-American status, setting school records for kickoff-return yards (1,726) and all-purpose yards (5,596) while also scoring 30 touchdowns.\nProfessional career.\nBrooks was drafted with the 24th pick in the first round of the 1981 NFL Draft, and played professionally with the San Diego Chargers (1981–1983), the Cincinnati Bengals (1984–1991), the Cleveland Browns (1992) and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1992).\nHe was a key participant in two of the most famous games in NFL lore during his rookie season with the Chargers: The Epic in Miami and the Freezer Bowl. However, he started only seven games in three seasons with the Chargers, always second on the team to Chuck Muncie in rushing attempts and yards. He had only one 100-yard game with the Chargers, a 12-carry, 105-yard, three-touchdown outing against his future teammates. In 1984, he was traded to the Bengals for Pete Johnson, a move still widely regarded as the best trade in Bengals franchise history, as Johnson would play only one more season in the NFL before retiring.\nA four-time Pro Bowler (1986, 1988–1990), Brooks excelled at running, receiving and kick returning. He was noted for his ability to make yards after contact and continue fighting for extra inches while being tackled. By the time he left the Bengals in 1991, he was the team's all-time leading rusher with 6,447 yards (since surpassed by Corey Dillon's 8,061 yards), and is still among the Bengals' top 15 all-time leading receivers with 297 receptions for 3,012 yards. By the time of his retirement after the 1992 season, Brooks amassed 7,962 rushing yards, 383 receptions for 3,621 receiving yards, 565 punt return yards, 2,762 kickoff return yards and scored 79 touchdowns (49 rushing and 30 receiving). Between 1968 (when John David Crow and Timmy Brown retired) and 2005 (Marshall Faulk), Brooks was the only member of the 30/30 club (30+ rushing and receiving touchdowns, accomplished by only seven players). , Brooks' 14,910 total net yards rank him #41 on the NFL's list of career all-purpose yards.\nThough he started every game in 1985, he and fullback Larry Kinnebrew finished the season with almost identical carry and yardage stats. His breakthrough season was 1986, which included a memorable run in a December 7 contest against the New England Patriots in which Brooks made several cutbacks, broke several tackles and dragged defenders the final five yards across the goal line for a 56-yard touchdown run. He finished the game with 163 yards rushing and 101 yards receiving, one of only two 100/100 games in Bengals history. This was his sixth season in the league, but the first in which he reached 1,000 rushing yards (a then-franchise record 1,087 rushing yards) and the Pro Bowl. After missing half of the 1987 season with an injury, he returned with 931 yards and career-bests in rushing touchdowns (eight) and receiving touchdowns (six) in 1988 and was instrumental in the Bengals' run to Super Bowl XXIII. In 1989, he finished with a career-best/franchise-record 1,239 rushing yards (seventh in the NFL) and again broke 1,000 yards in 1990, including a 201-yard performance against the Houston Oilers. Brooks started 1991 with two games with more than 100 rushing yards, but had progressively fewer carries over the rest of the season (102 rushes for two touchdowns and a 3.3 yards-per-carry average, never once breaking 50 yards over the next 12 games). He was traded to the Browns in 1992, then to the Buccaneers midway through the season, retiring after a minor injury in the team's sixth game.\nNFL career statistics.\n, Brooks holds at least five Bengals franchise records, including:\nPersonal life.\nBrooks was arrested in 1999 for failure to pay child support, owing over $110,000. During proceedings, it was revealed that Brooks was illiterate, despite having received a college degree. When asked by the judge how he had graduated from Auburn, Brooks said, \"I didn’t have to go to class.\" He served three months of a six-month sentence before being assigned to a work-release program."

        "text": "Donkey basketball is a variation of the standard basketball game, played on a standard basketball court, but in which the players ride donkeys. A donkey basketball game is usually staged as a one-time fundraising event, typically in public schools. Commercial farms provide donkeys and equipment, splitting the proceeds with the hiring party. Donkey basketball has been practiced in the United States since the 1930s.\nDonkey basketball has been targeted by animal rights activists, who claim the sport is cruel to animals. Critics cite problems caused by inexperienced participants handling the donkeys, such as the beating and kicking of donkeys by the riders and donkey owners, and the intentional starvation of donkeys a few days prior to a basketball game to prevent them from urinating or defecating on the basketball courts. Promoters claim the events are \"supervised\" and the animals are \"treated humanely.\"\nA related game, called Donkey Baseball, was popular in the 1930s, with all players, except the batter, pitcher and catcher, straddled on donkeys. The batter would mount a donkey when running bases too. A fielder could dismount a donkey to pick up a ball, but must continue to hold the reins, and must remount before throwing. If he did not, the opposing team would be awarded the base. The game was created in 1934 by Ray L. Doan, and was the subject of a 1935 short film. "

        "title": "Tony Banks (American football)",
        "text": "Anthony Lamar Banks (born April 5, 1973) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback for 10 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Michigan State Spartans. Selected by the St. Louis Rams in the second round of the 1996 NFL Draft, Banks also was a member of the Baltimore Ravens, Washington Redskins, and Houston Texans. With the Ravens, he was part of the team that won the franchise's first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XXXV.\nHigh school years.\nBanks attended Hoover High School in San Diego, California, and was a letterman in football, basketball, and baseball.\nPost high school and college years.\nBanks played right field for the Minnesota Twins' Class A team in Ft. Myers, Florida, before enrolling at San Diego Mesa College in San Diego. He played there two years before transferring to Michigan State University.\nBanks places among the all-time record holders at Michigan State. He ranks sixth in passing completion percentage, tenth in career passing yards, and tenth in passing touchdowns. Banks was the first quarterback selected in the 1996 NFL Draft.\nIn the October 2010 issue of Sports Illustrated, former NFL agent Josh Luchs claimed he paid Banks 'several hundred dollars a month' while Banks was at Michigan State, a violation of NCAA eligibility rules.\nProfessional career.\nSt. Louis Rams.\nBanks was selected in the second round of the 1996 NFL Draft by the St. Louis Rams as the first quarterback selected in that year's draft. He soon found himself the starter as a rookie. Banks recorded significant yardage and touchdowns but also ended up setting a record for fumbles that first season, with 21. The team finished with a 6-10 record. Throughout the next two seasons Banks's play failed to improve significantly as the Rams finished last in their division with records of 5-11 and 4-12. During his time in St. Louis he developed a reputation for having a cocky attitude and a poor work ethic. After a 14-0 loss to the Miami Dolphins in Week 7 of 1998 he skipped the team flight back to St. Louis and did not appear at practice the next day. After three seasons with the Rams, the team signed Trent Green and then traded Banks to the Ravens for a fifth and seventh round draft pick.\nBaltimore Ravens.\nBanks accumulated the best statistics of his career with the Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens started Scott Mitchell and Stoney Case early in 1999, but neither worked out, so the team turned to Banks. In 1999, he threw a career-high 17 TDs next to only eight interceptions. He also mustered 2,136 passing yards. Banks played well in early 2000, but his fumbles and interceptions cost the team two games in October. Feeling the offense needed a spark after failing to score a touchdown over an entire month, the team replaced him with backup Trent Dilfer, who would remain the starter through the team's Super Bowl XXXV win. He finished 2000 with eight touchdowns and eight interceptions and was released in the off-season.\nDallas Cowboys.\nLeading into the 2001 season, Banks was signed by the Dallas Cowboys to replace the recently released and later retired Troy Aikman; however, on August 15, 2001, Banks was abruptly released by the Cowboys who chose instead to go with rookie Quincy Carter.\nWashington Redskins.\nLater that year, Banks signed with the Washington Redskins during Marty Schottenheimer's one-year tenure as head coach. While with the Redskins, he became the first quarterback to follow an 0–5 start with five straight wins. He was released after the season.\nHouston Texans.\nBanks signed with the Houston Texans. He was the second-string quarterback for the Houston Texans behind David Carr. He claims that he was asked by Houston's coaches not to play too well in practice to ensure that he would not upstage David Carr, who the team had drafted first overall in the 2002 NFL Draft. During his four-year tenure with the team, Banks received minimal playing time. On February 28, 2006, Banks was released by the Texans. He never returned to the NFL.\nCoaching career.\nOn March 9, 2020, Greenhill School, a private k-12 school in Addison Texas, announced that they were hiring Banks as their head football coach. He had previously served the school as an assistant coach."

        "title": "Chris Collins (basketball)",
        "text": "Christopher Ryan Collins (born April 19, 1974) is an American basketball coach who is currently the head men's coach at Northwestern University. Collins previously served as associate head coach of the Duke University men's basketball team and is the son of National Basketball Association (NBA) player, coach, and commentator Doug Collins.\nPlaying career.\nAt Glenbrook North High School in Northbrook, Illinois, Collins played on the varsity basketball team and won Illinois Mr. Basketball and McDonald's All American honors. After high school, he went on to play at Duke University. Collins received many honors for his play at Duke and was named to the All-ACC rookie team as a freshman in 1993. During his senior year, he was team captain, named Second Team All-ACC and also was awarded the Swett-Baylin Memorial Trophy, which is a trophy for Duke's MVP.\nAfter graduating from Duke, he played professional basketball in Finland for two years.\nCoaching career.\nCollins returned to the United States and became an assistant coach in the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) for the Detroit Shock for one year under head coach Nancy Lieberman; and at Seton Hall for two years under head coach Tommy Amaker. In 2000, he returned to his alma mater at Duke under Mike Krzyzewski as an assistant coach and was promoted to associate coach in the summer of 2008.\nHe was instrumental in Duke's signing of Jon Scheyer, a fellow Glenbrook North Mr. Basketball winner (2006), who, like Collins, had also considered attending Illinois. Scheyer, who Collins was key in luring to Duke, became head coach of the Blue Devils with Mike Krzyzewski's retirement following the 2021-2022 season.\nNorthwestern.\nWhen Bill Carmody was fired as head coach of Northwestern in March 2013, Collins was immediately mentioned as a primary target. Collins' hiring was announced March 27, 2013. After three years of gradual improvement, the 2016–17 season saw Collins lead the Wildcats to their best season since before World War II. The Wildcats finished with their first winning Big Ten Conference record in 49 years, earned their first NCAA Tournament appearance in school history, and went on to win their first NCAA Tournament game. Northwestern had been the only member of a power conference to have never made the tournament.\nFollowing the season, Northwestern struggled to capitalize on their tournament run, in part because of renovations to Welsh–Ryan Arena that forced the team to play at Allstate Arena, 13 miles to the west of Northwestern's campus. The team finished 10th in the conference in the 2017-18 season, and last in 2018-19. Despite those struggles, Collins was able to land Pete Nance, the highest-rated recruit in Northwestern history, who would begin play as a freshman in the 18-19 season. \nStruggles throughout the next few seasons would result in calls for Collins to be fired. At the conclusion of the 2021-22 season, Northwestern athletic director Derrick Gragg publicly stated that he had tasked Collins with \"making necessary changes\" to improve the team.\nAhead of the 2022-23 season, expectations for Northwestern were low, with many expecting that the departure of key pieces from the last year's team, power forward Pete Nance for North Carolina and center Ryan Young for Duke, would result in a bottom-two finish in the conference. \nHowever, Collins led the Wildcats to twelve conference wins, the most for Northwestern since 1931, and the second NCAA tournament berth in program history. Collins's decision to bring in assistant coach Chris Lowery and revamp the team's defensive approach was widely credited with turning the team around. Beyond the NCAA tournament appearance, where the Wildcats would again advance to the Round of 32, Collins also coached Northwestern to their first win over the No. 1 team in the AP Poll, when the Wildcats defeated Purdue in Evanston.\nIn the first conference game of the 2023-2024 season, Collins and Northwestern would again upset No. 1 ranked Purdue in Evanston, this time in overtime."

        "text": "David Scott Wilder (born October 14, 1960) is a former minor-league baseball player and a former major-league baseball executive.\nEarly life and education.\nWilder attended Berkeley High School in Berkeley, California and Contra Costa College. He earned a bachelor's degree in management from St. Mary's College of California, completing his degree while in the minor leagues.\nBaseball career.\nAn outfielder, Wilder played minor-league baseball in the Oakland A's and Chicago Cubs farm systems, but never advanced to the major leagues. He hit .267 in six seasons in the minors. On April 3, 1987, the Chicago Cubs famously traded future Hall of Fame pitcher Dennis Eckersley and infielder Dan Rohn to the A's for Wilder and two other players. \"Hey, I could have been traded for Joe Blow,\" Wilder told the San Francisco Chronicle in an article that was published on July 26, 2004. \"It's part of baseball history.\" Wilder's playing career ended in 1988. After his career ended, he worked as a baseball coach for two years for the University of California.\nCareer as a baseball executive.\nWilder began his management career with Oakland in 1990, working as a scout and as a coach at Class A Medford in the Northwest League. He later joined the Atlanta Braves as a West Coast regional scouting supervisor, becoming a baseball operations assistant in September 1994. He was named an assistant scouting director for the Braves in August 1995, making him the highest-ranking African-American at that time in the Braves' organization, other than Hall of Famer Hank Aaron.\nIn January 1996, Wilder joined the Chicago Cubs organization, becoming director of minor-league operations, and rising to become assistant general manager. In September 1999, the Milwaukee Brewers hired Wilder as vice president for player personnel, and he became the team's assistant general manager in 2001. In 2000, Wilder was on the selection committee for the United States Olympic baseball team.\nIn 2004, Wilder joined the Chicago White Sox. He became director of player development during the team's World Series-winning season in 2005, and he was credited with being largely responsible for the team's acquisition of closer Bobby Jenks from the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.\nIn 2005, Wilder interviewed with the Boston Red Sox for the general manager's job that became available with the departure of Theo Epstein.\nIn February 2007, the White Sox promoted Wilder senior director of player personnel. He continued to oversee the team's Latin American operations, as he had while previously serving as director of player development.\nScandal.\nOn May 16, 2008, the White Sox fired Wilder and two scouts after an investigation in Latin America. Federal authorities were called in as well, and the baseball commissioner's office was investigating the parents of several Latin players about bonuses that they may have received from major-league baseball teams. A major league baseball investigator confirmed to the Chicago Tribune that the investigation involved skimming and was limited only to the White Sox.\nOn February 11, 2011, Wilder pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud in federal court in Chicago. He was released on bond pending sentencing.\nOn August 28, 2013, U.S. district judge Charles Ronald Norgle, Sr. sentenced Wilder to two years in federal prison. He was ordered to begin serving his sentence on October 31, 2013. He was released from federal prison on October 9, 2015."

        "text": "The Leeward Islands cricket team is a first class cricket team representing the member countries of the Leeward Islands Cricket Association, an associate of the West Indies Cricket Board. Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts, Nevis, Anguilla, Montserrat, British Virgin Islands, US Virgin Islands and Sint Maarten are members of the Leeward Islands Cricket Association. The team does not participate in any international competitions (though Antigua and Barbuda took part at the 1998 Commonwealth Games), but rather in inter-regional competitions in the Caribbean, such as the Regional Four Day Competition and the Regional Super50. The team competes in regional cricket under the franchise name Leeward Islands Hurricanes. \nThe Leeward Islands has won a total of ten domestic titles – four in first class cricket and six in one-day cricket, but their last title was in 1997–98 when they won the double (although the first-class title was shared with Guyana). The list of prominent cricketers who have played for the Leewards Islands includes Curtly Ambrose, Eldine Baptiste, Kenny Benjamin, Winston Benjamin, Sheldon Cottrell, George Ferris, Ridley Jacobs, Viv Richards, Richie Richardson, Andy Roberts and Hayden Walsh Jr.\nHistory.\nThe Leeward Islands played their inaugural first-class game in 1958, and lost by an innings and 19 runs to Jamaica. Their first win did not come until 1968–69, when they beat Guyana by 43 runs at the Warner Park Sporting Complex ground. From 1965–66 to 1980–81 the team competed as the Combined Islands in first-class cricket, along with the best cricketers from the Windward Islands. However, when regular one-day competitions began in 1975–76 the island groups were separate, and the Leeward Islands won on their third outing in 1977–78.\nIn 1981–82 the Leeward Islands made their debut in the Shell Shield with a 57-run win over the Windward Islands (the season after the Combined Islands had won the title), but it was to take eight seasons until they could lift the first-class trophy – which by then had been renamed the Red Stripe Cup. From 1989–90 to 1997–98, the Leeward Islands won three outright first-class titles with one shared and three outright one-day titles with one shared. Since then their only major trophy has been their 2010–11 WICB Cup triumph.\nNotable players.\nThe list of prominent cricketers who have represented the Leeward Islands includes:\nGrounds.\nThe Leeward Islands play cricket on all their territories, though the only grounds to have seen Test cricket are the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, Warner Park in St Kitts and the now disused Antigua Recreation Ground. The Leeward Islands have also played home games at Salem Oval (Montserrat), Edgar Gilbert Sporting Complex (Saint Kitts), Carib Lumber Ball Park (Sint Maarten), Addelita Cancryn Junior High School Ground (St. Thomas) and Elquemedo Willet Park (Nevis)."

        "title": "FIS Alpine World Ski Championships",
        "text": "The FIS Alpine World Ski Championships is an alpine skiing competition organized by the International Ski Federation (FIS).\nHistory.\nThe inaugural world championships in alpine skiing were held in 1931. During the 1930s, the event was held annually in Europe, until interrupted by the outbreak of World War II, preventing a 1940 event. An event was held in 1941, but included competitors only from nations from the Axis powers or nations not at war with them. The results were later cancelled by the FIS in 1946 because of the limited number of participants, so they are not considered official.\nFollowing the war, the championships were connected with the Olympics for several decades. From 1948 through 1982, the competition was held in even-numbered years, with the Winter Olympics acting as the World Championships through 1980, and a separate competition held in even-numbered non-Olympic years. The 1950 championships in the United States at Aspen were the first held outside of Europe and the first official championships separate of the Olympics since 1939.\nThe combined event was dropped after 1948 with the addition of the giant slalom in 1950, but returned in 1954 as a \"paper\" race which used the results of the three events: downhill, giant slalom, and slalom. During Olympic years from 1956 through 1980, FIS World Championship medals were awarded in the combined, but not Olympic medals. The combined returned as a separately run event in 1982 with its own downhill and two-run slalom, and the Super-G was added to the program in 1987. (Both were also added to the Olympics in 1988.)\nThere were no World Championships in 1983 or 1984 and since 1985, they have been scheduled in odd-numbered years, independent of the Winter Olympics. A lack of snow in southern Spain in 1995 caused a postponement to the following year.\nList of host countries.\nA total of twelve countries have hosted the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships, including those which were shared with the Winter Olympics. All of the top-7 on the list of nations which have won FIS World Cup races have been selected as host at least twice. The World Championships have been held only once in the Southern Hemisphere, in August 1966 at Portillo, Chile. The list is complete through 2021 and does not include the unofficial 1941 event.\nEvents.\nNote: The men's super-G in 1993 and the team event in 2009 were cancelled due to adverse weather conditions, and no medals were awarded.\nSkiers with most victories.\nTop 10 skiers who won more gold medals at the Alpine Skiing World Championships (including at team events) are listed below. Boldface denotes active skiers and highest medal count among all skiers (including these who not included in these tables) per type.\nSkiers with most individual medals.\nParticipants with five or more medals in the individual disciplines (not including team events) at the Alpine Skiing World Championships are (boldface denotes active skiers):\nMultiple individual discipline winners.\nOnly seven skiers (three men and four women) have ever managed to win World championship in four or more different alpine skiing individual disciplines during their career, as listed in the table below. Anja Pärson of Sweden is the only skier in history to win World Championship golds in five individual disciplines.\nMedals by country.\n\"The tables for both genders include medals won at the nine Winter Olympics from 1948 through 1980, though these were also World Championships. The mixed team events is not included for both genders, therefore there is special table for these team competitions. Also, there are two cumulative medal tables – the first one includes medals won at the nine Winter Olympics from 1948 through 1980, the second one don't includes these medals. All tables are current through 2023.\""

        "title": "Phil Ford (basketball)",
        "text": "Phil Jackson Ford Jr. (born February 9, 1956) is an American former professional basketball player in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He graduated from Rocky Mount Senior High School in 1974, and had an All-American college career with the North Carolina Tar Heels.\nCollege career.\nFord was the first freshman under head basketball coach Dean Smith to start in his first collegiate basketball game. During the season, he averaged 16.4 points and 5.2 assists per game – both of which were UNC freshman records that would stand for more than 20 years. Ford led UNC to a second-place finish in the Atlantic Coast Conference regular season standings, and then to a championship win over NC State in the 1975 ACC tournament. This win broke N.C. State's two-year winning streak as ACC champions. Ford averaged 26 points in the tournament and was named tournament MVP – the first freshman in ACC history to achieve that honor.\nIn his sophomore season, Ford averaged 18.6 points and 7.0 assists per game. His assists average established a UNC single-season record until Ed Cota averaged 7.4 assists during the 1997–98 season. Ford led UNC to a first-place finish during the ACC regular season and was a first team All-ACC selection, an honor he would also receive in his junior and senior seasons. He also was a consensus second team All-American.\nIn his junior season, Ford averaged 18.7 points and 6.6 assists per game while once again leading the Tar Heels to a first-place ACC regular season finish. In the 1977 ACC tournament, Ford scored 26 points in the championship game against the Virginia to propel UNC to another conference title. In the 1977 NCAA Division I basketball tournament, Ford helped advance the Tar Heels into the Final Four and all the way to the NCAA Championship Game, despite hyperextending his shooting elbow in the regional semifinal game against Notre Dame. Ford was named a consensus first team All-American at the end of the season.\nIn his senior season, Ford averaged 20.8 points and 5.7 assists per game, and scored a career-high 34 points in his final home game – a victory against Duke, which clinched another ACC first-place finish for the Tar Heels. At the end of the season, Ford repeated as a consensus first-team All-American and was recognized as the National Player of the Year when he won the USBWA, NABC and Sporting News Player of the Year awards, as well as the John R. Wooden Award.\nNBA career.\nFord was the second overall pick in the first round of the NBA draft. While being coached by Cotton Fitzsimmons and forming a dynamic backcourt duo with Otis Birdsong which was noticed by many across the league, Ford was named NBA Rookie of the Year with the Kansas City Kings in 1979. During that season, on February 21, 1979, Ford recorded a career best 22 assists, while also scoring 26 points, grabbing 5 rebounds, and recording 5 steals, in a 133-117 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. During the 1980-81 NBA season, Ford scored a career high 38 points in a 113-107 win over the Houston Rockets on January 23, 1981. Just weeks later, Ford was forced to undergo surgery for a season ending eye injury, after which the Kings unexpectedly made it to the Western Conference Finals despite having a regular season record of 40-42. After the season, Ford struggled to return to his previous level of play, and was traded to the Nets, then traded to the Bucks, before being released and playing out his career on the Rockets.\nIn 482 NBA games, Ford scored 5,594 points, an 11.6 average, and had 3,083 assists, an average of 6.4 per game. He retired from the NBA in 1985.\nNational team career.\nAfter his sophomore season, Ford was the starting point guard for the 1976 U.S. Olympic team, coached by Dean Smith, which won the gold medal. In six Olympic games, Ford totaled 54 assists for a 9.0 assists per game average.\nStyle of play.\nFord was known as an excellent ballhandler and penetrator who possessed a very accurate pull-up jump shot. He was also very adept at making free throws, especially in the final minutes of close games. His ballhandling and free-throw shooting skill allowed him to be at his best when running Carolina's Four Corners offense, an offensive strategy that some college teams used to either stall or score only when taking extremely safe shots. However, when Ford was dribbling the ball in the center of the four corners alignment, he often found teammates for quick, easy baskets or drew fouls on the other team. Coach Smith often employed this offense when UNC needed to protect a lead in the final minutes of a game, and Ford's abilities all but ensured that such a lead would be maintained. Ford also mastered the 360-degree spinning layup.\nLegacy.\nFord is widely considered to be among the greatest college point guards of all time, and some contend he is still the greatest point guard ever to play in the ACC. He finished his career at Carolina as the all-time leading scorer in school history, with 2,290 points. He also set school and ACC career records for total assists, with 753 (a mark since broken by several other players). On December 18, 2008, Tyler Hansbrough surpassed Ford's career scoring total. He also finished his career as the only player in Atlantic Coast Conference history to score over 2,000 points and register at least 600 assists (a record now shared with Travis Best of Georgia Tech and Greivis Vásquez of Maryland). Ford was especially productive in ACC Tournament play, as he averaged 23.6 points per game in 8 career tournament contests.\nIn both his Junior and Senior years, Ford won the ACC Athlete of the Year award, making him one of just a few ACC athletes ever to win the award twice.\nFord was inducted into the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in May 1991. In 2002, Ford was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men's basketball team honoring the fifty best players in ACC history.\nCoaching career.\nIn 1988, he returned to North Carolina as an assistant coach, and helped lead the Tar Heels to the 1993 national title. After Smith retired in 1997, Ford became the top assistant to his successor, Bill Guthridge. Ford left the school following UNC's 1999–2000 season in which they reached the Final Four, along with the rest of Guthridge's staff, when Matt Doherty took over as head coach with his own coaching staff.\nFord currently works for the \"Educational Foundation\", the fund-raising arm of the University of North Carolina athletic department. He also briefly served as color commentator on UNC basketball broadcasts.\nFord served as an assistant coach to Larry Brown for the Detroit Pistons (2004–2005). After a brief stint as an assistant coach to Isiah Thomas for the New York Knicks (2005–2007), Ford was retained in the same position by the Charlotte Bobcats' new head coach Larry Brown from June 2008 to 2010."

        "text": "Adrian Nicholas Peterson (born July 1, 1979) is an American former professional football running back who played in the National Football League (NFL) and United Football League (UFL). He was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the sixth round of the 2002 NFL Draft, playing eight seasons for Chicago. Then he played for the Virginia Destroyers in the UFL. He played college football for the Georgia Southern Eagles, where he set numerous school, Southern Conference, and NCAA Division I-AA records, as well as winning two I-AA National Championships and receiving the Walter Payton Award for most outstanding player in I-AA football. He is currently serving as the director of student-athlete development for Georgia Southern.\nEarly years.\nPeterson was born to Porter R. and Reatha M. Peterson; his father works at a plant that makes Energizer batteries. Adrian Peterson was a two-time all-state, all-area selection and team MVP at Santa Fe High School in Alachua, Florida where he rushed for 4,949 yards during his prep career to earn All-America honors from ESPN and Blue Chip Illustrated. Peterson ran for 1,526 yards and 17 TDs on 185 carries (8.2 avg.) to earn Florida Class 4A Player-of-the-Year honors as a senior. He also lettered four times in track and two times each in weightlifting and basketball while in high school.\nCollege career.\nPeterson played for Georgia Southern from 1998-2001. He finished his career, not including the playoffs, with 6,559 rushing yards, a Division I football record, and won the Walter Payton Award in 1999. He was the first sophomore to win the award for most outstanding player in I-AA football history. Peterson finished among the top three vote-getters for the Walter Payton Award in all four of his college football seasons. In 57 career games including the playoffs, he carried 1,378 times for 9,145 yards (6.6 avg), 111 touchdowns and an average of 160 yards per game. On September 29, 2012, Peterson was inducted into the Georgia Southern hall of fame in a ceremony held during halftime at Paulson Stadium. In January 2014, College Sporting News announced that the FCS Offensive Player of the Year Award will be named after Peterson. Peterson was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2017.\nProfessional career.\nChicago Bears.\nThe Chicago Bears selected Peterson in the sixth round of the 2002 NFL Draft. During his first season as a Bear, he rushed for 101 yards on nineteen attempts, and scored a single touchdown. He missed most of the next season after sustaining an ankle injury. The team has primarily relied on Peterson as a specialist. In 2004, he led the Bears' special teams unit with 28 tackles.\nPeterson saw more action as a running back during the 2005 Chicago Bears season, after the Bears' top two running backs, Thomas Jones and Cedric Benson, suffered injuries. On November 13, in the first game that both were injured, a game against the San Francisco 49ers, Peterson eclipsed the 100 yard mark in a game for the first time in his career. He rushed for 120 yards on 24 attempts and scored a touchdown. On the season, Peterson rushed for 391 yards on 76 attempts, and scored two touchdowns. Peterson was the team's second leading rusher during the season, and even went on to score a touchdown during the NFC Divisional game against the Carolina Panthers.\nDuring the 2006 Chicago Bears season, Peterson returned to his role as a specialist and third string running back. He received occasional playtime as running back, but played a versatile role on the Bears' special teams. During the team's season finale, Peterson caught a 37-yard pass from Brad Maynard on a fake punt. In the NFC Championship game, Peterson tackled Michael Lewis and forced a fumble.\nAfter the Bears traded Jones prior to the 2007 season, Peterson was promoted to second string running back. However, first string running back Cedric Benson sustained a season-ending injury on November 25, against the Denver Broncos. During the same game, Peterson scored his second rushing touchdown of the season, when he powered into the endzone despite being enveloped by several Bronco defenders. With this news, Peterson moved to first string, with rookie Garrett Wolfe moved to second string. Peterson had his second 100-yard rushing game on December 23, 2007, against the Green Bay Packers. Peterson had another productive performance the next week, during the Bears’ season finale against the New Orleans Saints. He rushed for 91 yards, and even threw a 9-yard touchdown pass to Bernard Berrian.\nWhen the Bears drafted Matt Forte and brought in Kevin Jones, Peterson saw little to no action at running back. He was cut from the team after the Bears signed Chester Taylor before the 2010 season.\nPeterson signed with the Seattle Seahawks on August 12, 2010, but was released by the team just five days later.\nVirginia Destroyers.\nPeterson was drafted by the Virginia Destroyers in the third round (14th overall) of the 2011 UFL Draft. He signed with the team on June 15.\nCoaching career.\nOn February 13, 2018, Peterson returned to Georgia Southern as director of student-athlete development for the football team under Chad Lunsford. He took over for Andrew Dodge, who moved to an on-field coaching assignment toward the end of the 2016 season.\nPersonal life.\nPeterson is the younger brother of former Atlanta Falcons linebacker Mike Peterson. He is also related to Freddie Solomon, who played for the Miami Dolphins and San Francisco 49ers. He performs community work and hosts an annual free youth football camp. Additionally, Peterson, who has a speech impediment, volunteers to help children who also face the same challenge.\nPeterson released his autobiography \"Don't Dis My Abilities\" in 2013.\nOn February 17, 2015, Peterson's 7-year-old son died of brain cancer."

        "title": "Uruguay national rugby union team",
        "text": "The Uruguay national rugby union team (Spanish: \" Selección de rugby de Uruguay\"), nicknamed Los Teros, represents the Uruguayan Rugby Union in men's international rugby union . One of the older test sides in the world, Uruguay has qualified five times for the Rugby World Cup, in 1999, 2003, 2015, 2019 and most recently 2023. As of 10 July 2023 they are ranked 17th in the world, and are ranked 2nd in the Americas region, behind rivals Argentina.\nUruguay has consistently been one of the better fringe international sides in rugby union, having consistently beaten Tier 2/3 competition from across the globe. Uruguay won the South American Rugby Championship in 1981, the only time (pre-2014) that a team other than Argentina won the tournament. They came second on 19 occasions and third the remaining 9. As of 2012, Uruguay has been classified as a Tier 2 nation, which allows them to receive more funding from World Rugby.\nTheir home stadium is Estadio Charrúa in Montevideo and holds up to 14,000 people. Estadio Domingo Burgueño has also been used for some fixtures in the Americas Rugby Championship.\nThe nickname \"Los Teros\" refers to the national bird of Uruguay, the southern lapwing (Vanellus chilensis).\nHistory.\n1900s–60s.\nThere are reports of rugby football being played in Uruguay as early as 1865. The game was introduced by British immigrants, with the game being more popularized by the Congregation of Christian Brothers, who were of Irish origin. Because of this, Uruguay has one of the oldest rugby cultures outside the British Isles, and one of the most established in the South America.\nUruguay made their official international debut in 1948, in a game against Chile, which Uruguay lost 21–3. Following their debut match, they returned to competition in the Pan American Games, first against the more experienced Argentina, resulting in a 0–62 loss. Uruguay then faced Chile for the second time, defeating them by 8–3. The final match of the competition was a 17–10 win over Brazil. Uruguay thus became runners up in the first unofficial South American Rugby Championship.\nUruguay, after a four years hiatus, played Chile in 1956, who defeated them by 6–3. In 1958, they played for the first official South American Rugby Championship, in a pool of three countries. They first played Chile, this time losing by 9–34. The \"Teros\" met again Argentina, having another loss, this time by 3–50. Uruguay managed to defeat Peru (10–6) in the last game.\nIn 1960, Uruguay faced for the first time one of the powers of the Northern Hemisphere rugby, France XV, losing by 0–61 in Montevideo during a South American tour. Uruguay after this match entered their second South American Rugby Championship. They first won against Brazil in a close game (11–8), then losing to Chile (5–28) and Argentina (3–36) in the closest result to then between both countries.\n1970s – 1980s.\nThe 1970s started off with a win over Paraguay in 1971, which was followed by a win and loss against Chile and a win against Brazil. They also played Argentina twice in the 1970s. However, they won all their matches except for those against Argentina, as well as losing one game against Chile and drawing another. However, the next game against Argentina, two years later in 1979, Uruguay came close to defeating the Pumas, going down by just three points, the final score being 19 to 16.\nThe 1980s started off with a 54 to 14 win over Paraguay, which resulted in a winning streak that was stopped by Argentina in 1983. In 1985, France visited Montevideo for a second time to play the \"Teros\", beating the locals 34–6. Another short undefeated streak occurred over 1987/1989, which was broken by a 19 to 17 loss against Chile. This was followed by a sound loss to Argentina and loss to a new opponent, the United States Eagles.\n1990s.\nThe 1990s started off with wins against of Chile, Brazil and Paraguay. This was followed by more wins over their traditional opponents, though Uruguay still lost to Argentina, they also played Canada in a competitive 28–9 loss in 1995. Uruguay played some of the bigger nations such as Argentina, Canada and the United States, although the Canada and U.S. games were a lot closer than some of their previous encounters.\nA huge success for them was qualifying for the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales. They won their pool fixture against Spain, Uruguay finished third in their pool.\n2000–present.\nUruguay came within 10 points of Argentina in 2001, and also played nations such as Italy in the same year. Uruguay won most of their matches against their traditional Americas opponents in the early 2000s. Later in 2002, Uruguay defeated Canada, winning 25–23. They followed this up with a 10–9 win over the United States. They again qualified for the 2003 World Cup. They won their pool fixture against Georgia 24–12.\nUruguay's qualification for the 2007 World Cup started in Americas Round 3a, where they were grouped with Argentina and Chile. After losing their first match 26–0 to Argentina, they defeated Chile 43–15 in Montevideo, which saw them enter Round 4. In round 4 they faced the United States, and Uruguay lost on aggregate, and moved onto the repechage round as Americas 4. Uruguay played Portugal in the repechage over two legs — losing the first in Lisbon and winning the second in Montevideo — but lost on aggregate points and failed to qualify.\nUruguay lost the 2011 Rugby World Cup qualification. Uruguay had won the 2009 South American Rugby Championship \"A\" by defeating Brazil and Chile at the Estadio Charrúa. Uruguay then lost to the United States 22–27 and 6–27. In the repechage, Uruguay defeated Kazakhstan 44–7, but in the battle for the 20th and final spot at the 2011 Rugby World Cup, Uruguay tied Romania at home 21–21 and lost 12–32 in Bucharest.\nDuring the 2015 Rugby World Cup qualifying, Uruguay won the 2013 South American Rugby Championship \"A\", getting wins at the Estadio Charrúa against Brazil (58–7) and Chile (23–9). In March 2014, Uruguay faced the United States in a NACRA-CONSUR playoff for the last Americas qualification spot. Uruguay tied the home leg 27–27, but lost the away leg 32–13. Uruguay then moved to the repechage, where it defeated Hong Kong 28–3 at the Estadio Charrúa, to face Russia for the 20th and final spot at the 2015 Rugby World Cup. Uruguay qualified for the 2015 Rugby World Cup by defeating Russia by an aggregate score of 57–49 in the two-game series, winning the second game at home 36–27 in front of 14,000 fans at the Charrua Stadium.\nUruguay claimed three wins and two losses at the 2016 Americas Rugby Championship, but ranked fourth out of six because they only scored two bonus points. In 2017 the team also claimed three wins and two losses, finishing third. On 3 February 2018, \"Los Teros\" qualified for 2019 Rugby World Cup as Americas 2 after beating Canada in the home-away leg, and started it with a surprising 30-27 win over Fiji on 25 September: it was Uruguay’s first World Cup win in 16 years.\nOn 30 October 2019, nightclub in southwestern Japan filed criminal complaint against players from the Uruguay team for 2019 Rugby World Cup for allegedly damaging property.\nIn 2021, Uruguay qualified for the 2023 Rugby World Cup as Americas 1, after a 1-1 series draw with the United States They lost the first game 19-16, but won the second game 34-15.

        "title": "Mike Flanagan (baseball)",
        "text": " \nMichael Kendall Flanagan (December 16, 1951 – August 24, 2011) was an American professional baseball left-handed pitcher, front office executive, and color commentator. He spent 18 years as a player in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Baltimore Orioles (1975–1987, 1991–1992) and the Toronto Blue Jays (1987–1990).\nFlanagan was a starting pitcher for the Orioles from 1975 through 1987. He was named to the American League (AL) All-Star Team once in 1978. In 1979, the first of two years he would play on an AL pennant winner, his 23 victories led the circuit and earned him the AL's Cy Young Award. He was a member of the Orioles' World Series Championship team in 1983. During the 1987 season, he was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays, with whom he pitched through 1990. He returned to Baltimore to close out his playing career as a relief pitcher in 1991 and 1992. During this second tour, he combined with three other pitchers to throw a no-hitter against the Oakland Athletics on July 13, 1991. He was also the last Orioles pitcher to appear in a major-league contest at Memorial Stadium. In an 18-season career, Flanagan posted a 167–143 record with 1,491 strikeouts and a 3.90 earned run average in 2,770 innings pitched.\nHe served in three different positions with the Orioles after his retirement as an active player. He was the pitching coach in 1995 and 1998 and the executive vice president of baseball operations from 2006 through 2008. At the time of his death, he was one of the team's broadcasters, a role he had previously held three times (1994, 1996–1997, and 1999–2002).\nEarly years.\nBorn and raised in Manchester, New Hampshire, Mike was one of four children born to Ed and Lorraine Flanagan, the younger of their two sons. His grandfather, Ed Sr., had been a pitcher in the Boston Braves organization who could throw with both hands, and his father Ed had played minor league ball in the Boston Red Sox and Detroit Tigers systems. Ed died on December 13, 2020. Under their tutelage, Flanagan once struck out 18 batters in a six inning Little League game.\nFlanagan graduated from Manchester (NH) Memorial High School, where he was on the baseball and basketball teams that each won consecutive New Hampshire Interscholastic Athletic Association (NHIAA) Class L titles in 1970 and 1971. His pitching was limited in 1971 because of a left elbow injury he had sustained while playing American Legion Baseball for the local Henry J. Sweeney Post the previous summer. This factored into him not signing a contract after he was picked by the Houston Astros in the 15th round (346th overall) of the 1971 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft.\nUniversity of Massachusetts.\nFlanagan attended the University of Massachusetts (UMass), where he played baseball for the Minutemen in 1972 and 1973. He was a first-team All-Yankee Conference and first team All-New England selection in 1973, when he posted a 9–1 record with a 1.72 earned run average and 89 strikeouts, leading the Yankee Conference in all three categories. His .900 winning percentage was the best school single-season mark until Scott Meaney had a 6–0 record in 1990. Flanagan had a career earned run average of 1.19 and a career winning percentage of .923 (12–1), which are both still the best marks in school history. In addition to pitching for UMass, Flanagan played in the outfield. Offensively, he batted .320 in 128 at bats with six home runs and 29 runs batted in.\nAs a freshman, Flanagan played basketball at UMass on the same Freshmen team as Rick Pitino. Flanagan and Pitino crossed paths with Julius Erving, who was a junior on the Varsity at the time. Flanagan said, \"I really didn't know much about Dr. J until I came down on a fast break and pulled up to take a jump shot. Dr. J was nowhere in the area but, out of nowhere, he blocked the shot and nine players were running the other way. First thing I thought? Better work on my slider, because this is a whole different level of play.\" He received his degree from the UMass College of Education in 1975, and he was inducted into the UMass Athletic Hall of Fame in 2000.\nHe was a pitcher and outfielder for the Falmouth Commodores in the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL) during the summer of 1972. On the mound, he had a 7–1 record and a 2.18 ERA, while at the plate he batted .286 with 7 home runs. He was a member of the CCBL's inaugural Hall of Fame class in 2000.\nProfessional career.\nBaltimore Orioles (1975–1987).\nBreaking into the big leagues (1975–1976).\nFlanagan was selected again in the 1973 MLB draft, this time by the Baltimore Orioles in the 7th round (159th overall). When he signed with the Orioles, the ball club agreed to finance the remainder of his college education. He progressed through the organization, with stops at Class A Miami (1973–1974), Class AA Asheville (1974), and Class AAA Rochester, where he went 13–4 with a 2.50 earned run average in 1975.\nHis MLB career began with two appearances against the New York Yankees in the last month of the 1975 campaign. He made his debut pitching innings in relief of starter Wayne Garland in a 5–4 victory in the opener of a twi-night doubleheader at Memorial Stadium on September 5. His first start and decision was a 3–2 loss at Shea Stadium in the nightcap of another twin bill 23 days later on September 28 which was the final game of the regular season. He was on the verge of a shutout until the bottom of the ninth when the first three batters he faced reached base and Dyar Miller allowed all of them to score on a single and an error.\nFlanagan's 1976 campaign was split between Rochester and Baltimore. He did not get his first Major League win until a 7–1 complete-game triumph at home over the eventual American League (AL) West champion Kansas City Royals on September 1. In 20 games (10 starts), he had a 3–5 record, a 4.13 ERA, 56 strikeouts, 33 walks, and 83 hits allowed in 85 innings pitched.\nFull-time starter and All-Star (1977–1978).\nBy 1977, Flanagan was serving as a starting pitcher full-time; the season was the first of four straight in which he would pitch at least 230 innings. On May 14, he threw his first career shutout, holding the Oakland Athletics to five hits in a 2–0 victory at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum. He had 13 strikeouts on September 27 when the Orioles defeated the Detroit Tigers 6–1. In 36 games (33 starts), he had a 15–10 record, a 3.64 ERA, 149 strikeouts, 70 walks, and 235 hits allowed in 235 innings.\nIn 1978, Flanagan was the Orioles' Opening Day starter, the only year from 1974 through 1980 that Jim Palmer did not make the Opening Day start for Baltimore. Flanagan had a 10–1 record from May 5 through June 22, 1978, including a six-game winning streak from May 31 through June 22. He was selected to his only All-Star Game in 1978 after posting a 12–6 record and a 3.16 earned run average before the All-Star Break. Three times did he pitch over nine innings in a game: 11 on June 13 in a 3–2 victory over the Seattle Mariners, 11 on July 17 in a 2–0 loss to the Texas Rangers, and on September 22 in a 7–5 loss to the Tigers. He was not quite as effective in the second part of the season, as his record was just 7–9 and his earned run average was 4.60. Towards the end of the season, on September 26, he was one out away from pitching a no-hitter against the Cleveland Indians, with the Orioles leading 3–0. Then, Gary Alexander hit a home run. After the next two batters singled, bringing the potential go-ahead run to the plate, manager Earl Weaver replaced Flanagan with Don Stanhouse, who struck out the next hitter to preserve the victory. Flanagan was a workhorse for the Orioles in 1978, tying with Dennis Leonard for the AL lead with 40 games started and ranking fourth in the AL with innings pitched (behind teammate Palmer's 296, Leonard's , and Mike Caldwell's ), though he also led the AL in earned runs allowed with 126. His 19 wins were tied with Paul Splittorff for seventh in the AL, and he also tied with four others for fifth in the AL with 15 losses. He had a 4.03 earned run average and ranked fourth in the AL with 167 strikeouts (behind Nolan Ryan's 260, Ron Guidry's 248, and Leonard's 183).\nCy Young Award winner (1979).\nAfter posting a 12–6 record and a 4.05 earned run average before the All-Star break in 1979, Flanagan posted a 12–3 record and a 2.15 earned run average in the latter part of the season. From July 9 through September 13, the Orioles only lost one game he pitched, an outing against the Yankees where Flanagan allowed three runs in a complete game but Tommy John allowed only two for New York. Flanagan posted a 12–1 record over 15 games during the stretch. In the second game of a doubleheader against the Toronto Blue Jays on September 1, Flanagan allowed one run and seven hits in a complete game, 5–1 victory, becoming the first pitcher in the major leagues to win 20 games in 1979. After the game, pitching coach Ray Miller suggested that Flanagan's fastball was underrated, claiming that only five pitchers had thrown a harder one all year. Flanagan credited some of his success to learning how to throw a changeup; Scott McGregor taught him the pitch that season.\nThe 1979 season proved to be Flanagan's best, as he finished the year with a record of 23–9 and an earned run average of 3.08. He led the AL with 23 wins and five shutouts (tying for the latter with Ryan and Leonard), also ranking among AL leaders with a 3.08 earned run average (fourth behind Ron Guidry's 2.78, John's 2.96, and Dennis Eckersley's 2.99), 190 strikeouts (third behind Ryan's 223 and Guidry's 201), and innings pitched (third behind teammate Dennis Martínez's and John's ).\nHe won the Cy Young Award and the \"Sporting News\" AL Pitcher of the Year Award, also finishing sixth in AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting as the Orioles won the AL East.\nPalmer tried to convince Weaver to start Flanagan instead of him in Game 1 of the AL Championship Series (ALCS) against the California Angels, but Weaver insisted on going with the more experienced Palmer in a game the Orioles ultimately won 6–3 in 10 innings. The starter for Game 2, Flanagan held the Angels to three runs through seven innings before getting pulled in the top of the eighth after the first three runners reached (though Rod Carew did so on an error). He was charged with six runs (four earned) in seven innings but picked up the win in Baltimore's 9–8 victory; Baltimore defeated the Angels in four games. Flanagan started Game 1 of the World Series, allowing four runs to the Pittsburgh Pirates but pitching the whole game in Baltimore's 5–4 triumph. In Game 5, he threw shutout baseball for the first five innings but allowed two runs in the sixth as the Orioles fell behind 2–1. When Rick Dempsey doubled with two outs in the seventh inning, Weaver opted to pinch hit for Flanagan with Pat Kelly, in hopes of getting a run. Kelly struck out, and the Orioles went on to lose 7–1, with Flanagan taking the loss. Flanagan also was one of five pitchers the Orioles used in the ninth inning of Game 7. He gave up a single to the only batter he faced, Omar Moreno, who later scored as Pittsburgh went on to win the game 4–1 and the series 4–3. After Flanagan's season ended, on November 10, his hometown of Manchester honored him with \"Mike Flanagan Day\", in which he was escorted through town in a motorcade to the applause of over 1,000 spectators.\nNew contract &amp; World Series victor (1980–1983).\nAgainst the Tigers on September 17, 1980, Flanagan was called for a balk, which led to one of Weaver's most infamous tirades. After arguing with the umpire for about a dozen minutes, Weaver returned to the dugout and told Flanagan it was a bad call, to which Flanagan responded that he had indeed balked. The Orioles still won the game 9–3. Although his earned run average was more than one run higher for the team in 1980, he had a winning record once again. In 37 games (all starts), he had a 16–13 record, a 4.12 ERA, 128 strikeouts, and 71 walks. He was eighth in the AL with innings pitched but led the league in hits allowed with 278.\nThe 1981 Major League Baseball strike resulted in the cancellation of games in June and July. Flanagan's season was further interrupted in September, when tendonitis ended his streak of 157 scheduled starts made. \"It's just an oil change and a 30,000-inning checkup,\" he told reporters. In 20 games (all starts), he had a 9–6 record, a 4.19 ERA, 72 strikeouts, 37 walks, and 108 hits allowed in 116 innings.\nPrior to the 1982 season, Flanagan and the Orioles went to arbitration concerning his contract for the year. Unusually, Flanagan's requested price ($485,000 a year) was lower than the team's requested price ($500,000 a year), as the Orioles were not sure how much money he would be requesting. Flanagan accepted their offer in a five-year contract with an option for a sixth year. With no interruptions to his season this time, he was again able to pitch over 200 innings, with 236 thrown. In 36 games (35 starts), he had a 15–11 record, a 3.97 ERA, 103 strikeouts, and 76 walks in 36 games (35 starts).\nFlanagan's 1983 season started strong, as he won his first six decisions, culminating in a seven-hit shutout of the Seattle Mariners on May 11. However, he suffered a major injury in the first inning of the opener of a doubleheader against the Chicago White Sox on May 17, twisting his left knee. The injury kept him out of action until August 7 and kept his knee in a brace until May 24, 1984. Still, Flanagan won five games in a row from August 28 through September 17 as Baltimore won the AL East title. In 20 games (all starts), he had a 12–4 record, a 3.30 ERA, 50 strikeouts, 31 walks, and 135 hits allowed in innings pitched. His .750 winning percentage was third in the AL, behind Moose Haas's .813 and Richard Dotson's .759.\nIn Game 3 of the ALCS against the White Sox, Flanagan held the team to one run before getting replaced by Sammy Stewart in the sixth inning with his team up 6–1. He was awarded the victory in the 11–1 triumph, and Baltimore went on to defeat Chicago in four games. He started Game 3 of the World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies, giving up solo home runs to Gary Matthews and Joe Morgan before getting pinch-hit for by Ken Singleton in the fifth inning, as Baltimore had a man on second with two outs and a chance to score its first run against Steve Carlton. Singleton struck out, but the Orioles went on to win 3–2 before eventually winning the series in five games. Though 1979 was his best season statistically, Flanagan considered the World Championship campaign of 1983 as his best year in baseball.\nLast effective year with the Orioles and injuries (1984–1987).\nThe 1984 season would be Flanagan's last effective one with the Orioles. A three-hit shutout of the Royals in the second game of a doubleheader propelled his record to 9–6, but he lost his next five starts. Through August 18, he had a 9–11 record. Starting August 19, he posted a 4–2 record and a 3.57 earned run average over the remainder of the year to finish the season at 13–13. In 34 games (all starts), he had a 3.53 ERA, 115 strikeouts, 81 walks, and 213 hits allowed in innings. It was the last season in which he would record at least 100 strikeouts.\nOn January 24, 1985, Flanagan suffered another major injury, tearing his left Achilles tendon during a charity basketball game. The injury kept him out until July. In 15 starts, he had a 4–5 record, a 5.13 ERA, 42 strikeouts, 28 walks, and 101 hits allowed in 86 innings pitched.\nEight years after his first, Flanagan made his only other Opening Day start for the Orioles in 1986. His 1986 and 1987 campaigns were both affected by a return of his elbow tendonitis, which cost him four starts in 1986 and two months in 1987. In 29 games (28 starts) in 1986, he had a 7–11 record, a 4.24 ERA, 96 strikeouts, 66 walks, and 179 hits allowed in 172 innings pitched. Through the end of August 1987, he was 3–6 with a 4.94 ERA, though he was 3–1 with a 3.71 earned run average since returning from the tendonitis injury.\nToronto Blue Jays (1987–1990).\nFlanagan had been quite successful against Toronto in his career, as his 17–10 record was the best of any pitcher against the franchise since they were created in 1977. He was traded from the Orioles to the Toronto Blue Jays for Oswaldo Peraza on August 31, 1987, in a transaction that was completed four days later on September 4 when José Mesa was sent to Baltimore. When Flanagan joined the Blue Jays, the team released Phil Niekro to make room for him on their roster. His most memorable performance with the Blue Jays took place at Tiger Stadium on October 3, 1987, the penultimate game of the regular season. With Toronto in a first-place tie with Detroit and having lost its last five contests, Flanagan outlasted Jack Morris by pitching 11 innings before departing with the match deadlocked at 2–2. The Blue Jays ended up losing the game 3–2 one inning later and the AL East championship the following afternoon. Morris said after the game, \"Flanagan was so great, so competitive, that I considered my job to be survival – somehow keep us tied until he left the game. We weren't going to get to the playoffs beating him, we could only get there surviving him.\" In seven games (all starts) for the Blue Jays in 1987, he had a 3–2 record and a 2.37 ERA. His combined stats between Baltimore and Toronto that season were a 6–8 record, a 4.06 ERA, 93 strikeouts, 51 walks, and 148 hits allowed in 144 innings over 23 games (all starts).\nAgainst the Tigers on June 26, 1988, Flanagan won his 150th game, holding Detroit to one run over eight innings in a 4–1 victory. Healthy all season, he pitched 211 innings, topping the 200-inning mark for the first time since 1984 and last time in his career. He also won 10 or more games for the eighth and last time in his career. In 34 games (all starts), he had a 13–13 record, a 4.18 ERA, 99 strikeouts, 80 walks, and 220 hits allowed.\nThough his record was only 6–6, Flanagan had a 3.33 earned run average for the Blue Jays through July 21, 1989. Thereafter, he posted a 5.02 ERA, going 2–4. In 30 games (all starts), he had an 8–10 record, a 3.93 ERA, 47 strikeouts, 47 walks, and 186 hits allowed in innings. Even though he had a losing record, the Blue Jays won the AL East, and Flanagan had his only postseason experience with the Blue Jays. Starting Game 4 in the ALCS against the Athletics, he pitched innings, giving up five runs and three home runs. One of the latter was Jose Canseco's 480-foot (146.30 meters) shot in the third inning, which was the first home run to land in the top deck of the SkyDome. He took the loss in the game, and the Athletics went on to win the series in five games.\nFlanagan's final appearance with Toronto was a start that resulted in a 3–1 loss at home to the Tigers on May 4, 1990, as he surrendered all 3 runs in innings. He was released on May 8. In five starts, he had posted a 2–2 record, a 5.31 ERA, five strikeouts, eight walks, and 28 hits allowed in innings pitched. His overall record with the Blue Jays was 26–27. He did not pitch again that season, instead thinking about what he wanted to do next.\nSecond stint with the Baltimore Orioles (1991–1992).\nAfter being invited to Oriole training camp on a minor league contract in 1991, Flanagan made the team as a relief pitcher. His best moment as a reliever came on July 13 against Oakland. He was called to the plate in the seventh inning after starter Bob Milacki, who had thrown six no-hit innings, was struck by a line drive and had to leave the game. Flanagan walked one but pitched a hitless seventh, middle reliever Mark Williamson pitched a hitless eighth, and closer Gregg Olson pitched a hitless ninth, giving the four a combined no-hitter. On September 27, manager Johnny Oates brought him in to record the last two outs by an Oriole pitcher in the final baseball game played at Memorial Stadium, a 7–1 loss to the Tigers. In 64 games (just one of which was a start), he had a 2–7 record, a 2.38 ERA, 55 strikeouts, 25 walks, and 84 hits allowed in innings. He also recorded three saves, giving him a total of four in his career, as he had previously recorded one in 1977.\nBaltimore's first season at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, 1992, was Flanagan's last. He appeared in his final game on September 27, pitching two scoreless innings in a 6–1 loss to the Red Sox. In 42 games, all in relief, he had no record, an 8.05 ERA, 17 strikeouts, 23 walks, and 50 hits allowed in innings.\nLegacy.\nIn an 18-season career, Flanagan posted a 167–143 record with a 3.90 ERA, 1,491 strikeouts, 890 walks, and 2,806 hits allowed in 2,770 innings pitched. He ranks among the Orioles' all-time leaders in many categories. His 143 wins rank fourth (behind Palmer's 268, Dave McNally's 181, and Mike Mussina's 147) and his 1,297 strikeouts rank fourth (behind Palmer's 2,212, Mussina's 1,535, and McNally's 1,476). He is third with 328 games started (behind Palmer's 521 and McNally's 384) and third with innings pitched (behind Palmer's 3,948 and McNally's ). Flanagan also ranks 10th with 98 complete games and 17 shutouts. Among the franchise's single-season record-holders, his 23 wins in 1979 are tied with Mike Cuellar's 1969 total and Palmer's 1975 total for sixth-best and his 40 starts in 1978 are tied with several others for first. The Orioles inducted Flanagan into their Hall of Fame in 1994.\nSense of humor.\nFlanagan was noted for his sense of humor, especially when it involved using puns to create nicknames. In his baseball column in the Sunday issues of \"The Boston Globe\" during the late-1970s, Peter Gammons ran a regular feature called the \"Mike Flanagan Nickname of the Week\". One example was John \"Clams\" Castino, which was a play on clams casino. Another was \"Mordecai Six Toe\" Lezcano, based on Mordecai \"Three Finger\" Brown and given to Sixto Lezcano. When the Blue Jays allowed Tony Solaita to sign with the Nippon-Ham Fighters after the 1979 campaign, he was dubbed \"Tony Obsolaita\". During the 1980 season, Flanagan called himself \"Cy Young\", Jim Palmer \"Cy Old\", Steve Stone \"Cy Present\" and Scott McGregor \"Cy Future\". When Storm Davis, whose pitching motion resembled Palmer's, joined the Orioles two years later in 1982, he was \"Cy Clone\". Flanagan added that pitchers became \"Cy-bex\" if they were injured and \"Cy-onara\" when they were no longer effective. Two monikers that stuck were \"Full Pack\" and \"Stan the Man Unusual\", both of which were coined for Don Stanhouse; the former nickname referred to the relief pitcher's causing manager Earl Weaver to smoke a full pack of cigarettes while Stanhouse was pitching, and the latter nickname was a play on \"Stan the Man\" Musial's nickname. This nickname concept was later popularized by ESPN's Chris Berman, who was inspired by the feature in Gammons' column.\nPost-playing days.\nAfter his playing career ended, Flanagan remained involved with the Orioles in various capacities. His career as a color commentator on Orioles telecasts began when he made broadcasts for Home Team Sports (HTS) in 1994. In 1995, he served as the Orioles pitching coach under manager Phil Regan. After that, he was appointed by HTS as the color commentator alongside Mel Proctor in early January 1996, following the controversial dismissal of John Lowenstein, a former Oriole teammate of Flanagan's. He also teamed with Michael Reghi in 1997. In 1998, he was succeeded by Rick Cerone as he again became the pitching coach for the Orioles, this time under Miller.\nFlanagan rejoined Reghi in the broadcast booth in 1999. He continued as a commentator through the 2002 season, during which HTS evolved into Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic. After the 2002 season, Buck Martinez was hired as a broadcaster, as Flanagan and Jim Beattie were named co-vice presidents of baseball operations for the Orioles in December 2002. When Beattie was dismissed following the 2005 season, Flanagan became the Orioles' executive vice president of baseball operations, a position equal to the status of general manager. He served in this role until 2007, when Andy MacPhail replaced him as the team's top executive. Flanagan remained with the team in a lesser capacity until his contract expired after the 2008 season.\nIn 2010, Flanagan went back behind the microphone, joining the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN) as the Orioles' secondary analyst after Martinez became the Blue Jays' lead broadcaster on Rogers Sportsnet. Both Flanagan and Palmer provided color commentary along with rotating play-by-play announcers Gary Thorne and Jim Hunter through the 2011 season.\nPitching style.\nFlanagan's pitch selection included a slow curve, a heavy sinker, a fastball, and the changeup McGregor taught him in 1979. According to Rick Dempsey, who caught Flanagan with the Orioles, \"On the days he didn't have good stuff, he just kept coming at you. He would change his rhythm, change his speed, drop down, throw a sidearm curveball—use every weapon in his arsenal to get you out. And then on the days when he had good stuff, you had no chance against him.\" His fastball was not one of baseball's fastest, but he compensated for this by relying on the other three pitches to win ballgames.\nPersonal life.\nFlanagan married his first wife, Kathy Walsh, in January 1977. Their oldest daughter Kerry Ellen was the fourth American born through in vitro fertilization (IVF) and the first IVF baby not born by Caesarean section. The conception was performed at the Eastern Virginia Medical School. She was born at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center on July 9, 1982. Mike and Kathy had a second daughter, Kathryn \"Katie\" Kendall. Later, they divorced, and Mike married Alex Lynn Brienza, with whom he had a third daughter, Kendall.\nDeath.\nWhen Flanagan's wife Alex did not hear from her husband on August 24, 2011, she phoned a neighbor for help. The neighbor went to the home and called 9-1-1 after failing to find him. Police discovered a body on the property but could not immediately determine the identity because the wounds were so severe. The body was later identified as Flanagan, with the cause of death determined to be a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head.\nPolice said that Flanagan was distressed about financial issues. WBAL-TV reported that Flanagan was still despondent about his perceived failures during his tenure in the Orioles' front office. About one year after her husband's death, Alex Flanagan told Dan Rodricks of the \"Baltimore Sun\" that her husband had struggled with depression, seeing a therapist for over 20 years. She also said that he had an alcohol problem.\nThe Orioles wore a black patch bearing the text \"Flanny\" on the right sleeves of their jerseys for the rest of the 2011 season in tribute. After 2012, the Baltimore Orioles kept Flanagan's number 46 out of circulation until 2024, when it was worn by Craig Kimbrel. Jeremy Guthrie was previously the last player to wear the number in 2011.\nExternal links.\n, or Baseball Almanac, or Retrosheet, or Pura Pelota (Venezuelan Winter League)"

        "title": "Stanley Cup Finals",
        "text": "The Stanley Cup Finals in ice hockey (also known as the Stanley Cup Final among various media, ) is the National Hockey League's (NHL) annual championship series. The winner is awarded the Stanley Cup, North America's oldest professional sports trophy, and one of the \"most important championships available to the sport [of ice hockey]\" according to the International Ice Hockey Federation.\nOriginally inscribed the \"Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup\", the trophy was donated in 1892 by Lord Stanley of Preston, then–Governor General of Canada, initially as a \"challenge trophy\" for Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club. The champions held onto the Cup until they either lost their league title to another club, or a champion from another league issued a formal challenge and defeated the reigning Cup champion in a final game to claim their win.\nProfessional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906. Starting in 1915, the Cup was officially held between the champion of the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the champion of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). After a series of league mergers and folds, it became the championship trophy of the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1926. Starting in 1982, the championship round of the NHL's playoffs has been a best-of-seven series played between the champions of the Eastern and Western Conferences. Western champions have won 21 times, while the Eastern champions have won 19 times.\nHistory.\nThe Stanley Cup was first awarded to the Montreal Hockey Club in 1893 when the team won the 1893 AHAC season. The team then had to defend its champion-title both through league championships and challenge games organised by the Stanley Cup trustees. Until 1912, these challenges could take place before or during a league season. After 1912, the trustees ordered that challenges only take place after all league games were completed.\nThe last challenge, in 1914, was the inauguration of the first \"World Series\" of ice hockey, a series between the Stanley Cup and league champion Toronto Hockey Club of the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Victoria Aristocrats, champions of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). The series was pre-arranged between the two leagues before the season after post-season exhibitions held in their previous seasons. The inaugural series was to be held in the city of the NHA champion, and alternate annually following the series.\nAfter the series got under way, there was some concern that the series would not produce an \"official\" Stanley Cup champion. The Victoria club had not formally applied to the Stanley Cup trustees to challenge for the Cup. A letter arrived from the Stanley Cup trustees on March 17, that the trustees would not let the Stanley Cup travel west, because they did not consider Victoria a proper challenger, as they had not verified themselves with the trustees. However, on March 18, trustee William Foran stated that it was a misunderstanding. PCHA president Lester Patrick, had not filed a challenge, because he had expected Emmett Quinn of the NHA to make all of the arrangements in his role as hockey commissioner, whereas the trustees thought they were being purposely ignored. The Victoria challenge was accepted. Any tension was diffused as Toronto successfully defended the Cup by sweeping a best-of-five series in three games. This began the end of the influence of the Stanley Cup trustees on the challengers and series for the Cup. In March 1914, trustee William Foran wrote to NHA president Emmett Quinn that the trustees are \"perfectly satisfied to allow the representatives of the three pro leagues (NHA, PCHA and Maritime) to make all arrangements each season as to the series of matches to be played for the Cup.\"\nVictoria vs. Toronto\n\"All games played at Arena Gardens in Toronto.\"\nPart of their 1913 agreement to set up drafting and player rights ownership, the NHA and PCHA agreed to have their respective champions face each other for the Cup. At the same time, the NHA concluded a similar agreement with the Maritime Hockey League but the MHL champions abandoned their 1914 challenge and did not challenge again. From 1914 onwards, the Stanley Cup championship finals alternated between the East and the West each year, with alternating games played according to NHA and PCHA rules. The Cup trustees agreed to this new arrangement, because after the Allan Cup became the highest prize for amateur hockey teams in Canada, the trustees had become dependent on the top two professional leagues to bolster the prominence of the trophy. After the Portland Rosebuds, an American-based team, joined the PCHA in 1914, the trustees issued a statement that the Cup was no longer for the best team in Canada, but now for the best team in the world. Two years later, the Rosebuds became the first American team to play in the Stanley Cup championship finals. In 1917, the Seattle Metropolitans became the first American team to win the Cup. After that season, the NHA dissolved, and the National Hockey League (NHL) took its place.\nIn 1919, the Spanish influenza epidemic forced the Montreal Canadiens and the Seattle Metropolitans to cancel their series tied at 2–2–1, marking the first time the Stanley Cup was not awarded.\nThe format for the Stanley Cup championship changed in 1922, with the creation of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL). Now three leagues competed for the Cup and this necessitated a semi-final series between two league champions, with the third having a bye directly to the finals. In 1924, the PCHA and the WCHL merged to form the Western Hockey League (WHL) and the championship reverted to a single series. After winning in the 1924–25 season, the Victoria Cougars became the last team outside the NHL to win the Stanley Cup.\nThe WHL folded in 1926, and most of the players moved to the NHL. This left the NHL as the only league left competing for the Cup. Other leagues and clubs have issued challenges, but from that year forward, no non-NHL team has played for it, leading it to become the \"de facto\" championship trophy of the NHL. In 1947, the NHL reached an agreement with trustees P. D. Ross and Cooper Smeaton to grant control of the cup to the NHL, allowing the league itself to reject challenges from other leagues that may have wished to play for the Cup. A 2006 Ontario Superior Court case found that the trustees had gone against Lord Stanley's conditions in the 1947 agreement. The NHL has agreed to allow other teams to play for the Cup should the league not be operating, as was the case in the 2004–05 NHL lockout.\nBroadcasting.\nThe first television broadcast of the Stanley Cup Finals in Canada was in . English-language coverage was aired by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), with Danny Gallivan calling the play-by-play, Keith Dancy providing the colour commentary, and Wes McKnight hosted. The \"Hockey Night in Canada\" team of Gallivan and Dancy called the next eight finals. Gallivan called his last championship series in . For decades, \"Hockey Night in Canada\" on CBC remained the exclusive English-language broadcaster across Canada, except in when a lengthy NABET strike forced coverage to be instead aired on CTV, and from to when the series was split between CBC and either CTV or Global TV. In , the CBC telecast became a Rogers Media-produced broadcast under a sub-license agreement, with it streaming on Rogers Media's digital platform, and a simulcast on Sportsnet starting in .\nFrench-language broadcasts in Canada also began in 1953, with play-by-play commentator Rene Lecavalier and colour commentator Jean-Maurice Bailly on CBC's Télévision de Radio-Canada (SRC) division. SRC continued to be the exclusive French-language broadcaster until when Réseau des sports (RDS) took over. Since 2015, under a sub-license agreement with Rogers, TVA has been the exclusive home of French-language broadcasts in Canada.\nThe first television broadcast in the United States was in , covered by local Chicago station WGN, while network broadcasts started in on NBC. However, national coverage on American television, like the rest of the NHL season, remained in a state of flux for decades. From 1966 to 1975, NBC and CBS held the rights at various times, but they each only covered selected games of the series. It was then carried on syndication from 1976 to 1979 through the 1970s NHL Network. In 1980, the Hughes broadcast network simulcast CBC's feed before the series was moved to cable. During its time on cable from 1980 to 1993, rights to the series was held at various times by USA, SportsChannel America, and ESPN, but there was no exclusive coverage of games and thus local broadcasters could also still televise them regionally as well. In , Fox signed on to be the exclusive national broadcast network of selected games of the final round, splitting it with ESPN. This splitting of exclusive national coverage between a cable and a broadcast network was then passed to ABC and ESPN in , and then NBC and Versus (now NBCSN) in . Since , the series has been rotated annually between ABC in even years and the cable channel TNT in odd years (with the option for simulcasts on their respective sister cable networks or streaming platforms).\nSeries format.\nThe championship series began with the interleague 'World Series' played in one city. The series alternated between a rink of the NHA and later the NHL and a rink of the PCHA and later the WCHL/WHL. It was not until the demise of the WHL, that the final series alternated games between the two finalists' home ice.\nThe series allowed ties until 1928. As the two and later three leagues differed, the series would alternate using each league's rules. The PCHA continued to use seven-man team play, and games would alternate with six and seven-man games.\nAfter the NHL became the last remaining league to compete for the Cup, the trophy was then awarded to the winner of the NHL's championship playoff round. This first took place in 1927 between the Boston Bruins and the Ottawa Senators, which was planned to be a best-of-three series, although the series allowed ties. The series ended after four games, when the Senators defeated the Bruins in the fourth game.\nThe NHL has changed its playoff format several times since 1927, and thus the final round has not always pitted conference or division playoff champions against each other. In the playoff format used from 1929 to 1938, the two teams with identical division ranking would face each other (i.e. the first place teams played each other, the second place teams play each other, and likewise for the third place teams). The winner of the first place series would automatically advance to the final round. The winner of the second and third place series would then play each other, with the winner of that series earning the other berth to the championship round.\nDuring the Original Six era, the top four teams made the playoffs, with the first and third place teams battling in one semifinal series, while the second and fourth place teams battled in the other. And from 1975 to 1981, all the playoff teams were seeded regardless of division or conference. From 1982 to 2020, the NHL's final round pitted the league's two conference playoff champions. In 2021, the league temporarily realigned due the COVID-19 pandemic, as a result the four playoff division champions were re-seeded and played in the Semifinals, with the winners of those series advancing to the finals. The league then returned to the previous conference based playoff format in 2022.\nChampions.\n1. The NHL includes the Toronto Hockey Club (Toronto Arenas) 1918 win and the 1922 Toronto St. Patricks win in the Toronto Maple Leafs total.\n2. The Chicago Blackhawks were known as the Chicago Black Hawks before the 1986–87 season.\n3. The Montreal Canadiens totals include the 1919 finals that ended with a no-decision because of the Spanish flu epidemic."

        "text": "William Henry Watkins (May 5, 1858 – June 9, 1937), sometimes known as \"Wattie,\" or \"Watty,\" was a Canadian-born baseball player, manager, executive and team owner whose career in organized baseball spanned 47 years from 1876 to 1922.\nHe began playing organized baseball in Canada and Michigan and played one season of Major League Baseball as an infielder for the Indianapolis Hoosiers in 1884. He was a manager of five major league clubs and several minor league clubs, including stints with the Indianapolis Hoosiers (1884–85), Detroit Wolverines (1885–1888), Kansas City Cowboys (1888–89), St. Louis Browns (1893) and Pittsburgh Pirates (1898–99). He led the 1887 Detroit Wolverines to the first professional sports championship for Detroit with a National League pennant and a victory over the St. Louis Browns in the 1887 World Series. He was also the business manager of the 1914 Indianapolis Hoosiers team that won the Federal League pennant, the first and only major league baseball championship for Indianapolis.\nEarly years.\nWatkins was born in Brantford, Canada West, in 1858. His parents, John Harton Watkins and Eliza Jane (Tyler) Watkins, were immigrants to Canada from Wales and Ireland, respectively. His mother died in 1868, and he was thereafter raised by his maternal grandparents in Erin, Ontario. Watkins attended Upper Canada College in Toronto for one year, and he began playing organized baseball in 1876 as part of \"the academy team\" in Milton, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto. He also held jobs as an apprentice for a manufacturer of novelty games and with a branch of the Ingles Corliss Engine Works. In 1879, at age 21, Watkins moved to Port Huron, Michigan, where he lived for the next 40 years.\nProfessional baseball.\nGuelph and St. Thomas (1879–81).\nFrom 1879 to 1880, Watkins played for the Maple Leafs of Guelph in Southwestern Ontario. The Maple Leafs won the Canadian amateur championship while Watkins was a player. In 1881 and/or 1882, he was a player-manager for the Atlantic Club of St. Thomas, Ontario (part of the London, Ontario metropolitan area). He led the Athletics to the Ontario provincial baseball championship in 1881.\nPort Huron and Bay City (1882-84).\nWatkins joined the Port Huron, Michigan, baseball club late in the 1882 season. In 1883, he served as player-manager for the Port Huron club, playing at third base, and leading the club to a Michigan State League championship.\nIn September 1883, Watkins was hired to take over as manager of the Bay City, Michigan club for the 1884 season at a salary of $2,000. He led Bay City to a tie for first place in the Northwest League when the team disbanded in July 1884.\nIndianapolis, Part I (1884).\nOn August 1, 1884, Watkins made his major league debut with the Indianapolis Hoosiers of the American Association. Watkins appeared in 34 games, 23 at third base, nine at second base and two at shortstop. Watkins also took over as the Hoosiers' manager, compiling a 4-18 record.\nOn August 26, 1884, Watkins was hit on the head by a pitch from Gus Shallix, at Cincinnati. The \"Cincinnati Enquirer\" described the incident as follows:With two out, Watkins came to bat and fell a victim to one of the swift curves of Shallix. The poor fellow ducked his head, but it was too late, and the ball caught him on the temple. He rolled over into the diamond, while a thrill of horror passed through the hearts of those in the stands. He was half carried, writhing nervously with pain, to the directors' room, where it was found that though the shock to his system had been great, no bones were broken.\nNewspaper accounts indicate that he \"hovered between life and death\" for five days. It took two weeks for him to recover and during that time, he lost 16 pounds. Watkins returned briefly as a player after the injury, but his performance was substantially diminished. On September 14, 1884, Watkins' error at second base let in most of Baltimore's runs in a 4-4 tie game. He appeared in his final game as a player on October 13, 1884.\nNewspaper stories published in 1912 in the \"Indianapolis Star\" and in 1937 in \"The Sporting News\" claimed that Watkins' hair turned prematurely white in 1884 due to the injury sustained when he was struck on the head. In his biography for the SABR Baseball Biography Project, Bill Lamb wrote that the story about Watkins' hair turning white appears to be \"folklore\", as \"post-beaning photographs\" (including the image displayed above) \"show Watkins with reddish-brown hair and mustache until he was well into middle age.\"\nIndianapolis, Part II (1885).\nIn 1885, the Indianapolis club in the American Association disbanded. Along with Ted Sullivan, Tom Loftus, and George Tebeau, Watkins helped organize the original Western League, a minor league baseball circuit based in the Midwestern United States. A new version of the Indianapolis Hoosiers was established in the Western League with Watkins as the manager. In April 1885, \"The Sporting Life\" praised Watkins' effort in maintaining \"rigid discipline\", putting an end to the \"carousals\" of the prior year, and ridding the club of \"the whiskey element\", and noted that Watkins had become \"the most popular and efficient manager the club has ever had.\"\nBy mid-June, the Hoosiers were the dominant team in the Western League, compiling an .880 winning percentage. However, the league disbanded in mid-June, and a rush developed to sign the players on the Indianapolis roster, a line-up that included Sam Thompson, Deacon McGuire, Sam Crane, Jim Donnelly, Chub Collins, Mox McQuery, Gene Moriarty, and Dan Casey.\nSam Thompson later told the colorful story of the Hoosiers' acquisition by Detroit. Detroit sent two representatives (Marsh and Maloney) to Indianapolis, principally to sign the Hoosiers' battery of Larry McKeon and Jim Keenan. The Wolverines were outbid by the Cincinnati Reds for McKeon and Keenan but wound up with Watkins and the rest of the team's starting lineup. The only catch was that a 10-day waiting period would allow other teams to outbid Detroit. Marsh and Maloney promptly sent the players to Detroit and quartered them in a hotel there. The next morning, the players were told that the team had arranged a fishing trip for them. The players boarded the steamship \"Annette\" and enjoyed the first day and night of successful fishing. After three days, the players became suspicious, but the ship captain laughed when asked when they would return to Detroit. As the players became mutinous on the sixth day, the captain admitted he had been ordered to keep them \"out at sea\" for 10 days. In another account, Thompson described his 10 days aboard the \"Annette\" as follows: We were prisoners, but well cared-for prisoners. Anything in the line of creature comforts you could find packed away on ice. We lived on the best in the market, and spent the rest of the time in fishing and playing poker, chips having very thoughtfully been provided. On the night of the tenth day, at midnight, we were all taken ashore where Watkins met us and signed us to our contracts.\nThe players were only later presented with their accumulated mail which included scores of offers from other clubs. A writer in the \"Detroit Free Press\" noted: \"Detroit magnates showed some inside baseball brains and great finessing in sending the players away from all tempters for that period when they belonged to no club.\"\nDetroit (1885-88).\nWhen Watkins took over as manager of the Detroit Wolverines in June 1885, the team had compiled a 7-31 record to that point in the season. With the infusion of talent from Indianapolis, the team improved to 34–36 for the remainder of the 1885 season.\nLate in the 1885 season, Detroit acquired four players from the Buffalo baseball club (Jack Rowe, Dan Brouthers, Hardy Richardson, and Deacon White) who were known as the \"Big Four.\" The \"Big Four\" were \"regarded for many years as the greatest quartette in the history of the national pastime.\" The \"Big Four\" joined Detroit for the 1886 season. With the addition of the \"Big Four\", the Wolverines improved substantially, finishing in second place with an 85-38 record in 1886.\nThe 1887 season was the pinnacle in the history of the Detroit Wolverines. The team was loaded with hitters, including six regulars who hit above .300: Sam Thompson (.372 and 166 RBIs in 127 games), Dan Brouthers (.338 and 101 RBIs in 123 games), Larry Twitchell (.333), Hardy Richardson (.328), Jack Rowe (.318) and Deacon White (.303). The pitching staff was led by \"Pretzels\" Getzien, a curveball specialist who compiled a 29–13 (.690) win–loss records and a 3.73 earned run average. Outfielder Larry Twitchell also started 12 games as pitcher and compiled an 11–1 record. The Wolverines won the National League pennant with a 79-45 record and then defeated the St. Louis Browns in the 1887 World Series.\nDuring the 1888 season, the Wolverines fell to fifth place. In late August 1888, the Detroit club fired, or accepted the resignation of, Watkins as their manager, and Robert Leadley was hired as \"acting manager\" in his place. The Wolverines compiled a 49–44 record in their final year under Watkins.\nKansas City (1888–89).\nAfter parting ways with the Wolverines in late August 1888, Watkins was hired in early September 1888 as the manager of the Kansas City Cowboys of the American Association. He led the club to an 8–17 record in the final month of the 1888 season and a 55-82 record in 1889.\nSt. Paul (1890–91).\nIn June 1890, Watkins was hired as the mid-season replacement manager for the St. Paul Apostles of the Western Association. Watkins had little success in turning the St. Paul club around, and in August 1890, \"The Sporting Life\" reported that Watkins had been forced to release players and cut salaries to reduce expenses, and that he was \"running the St. Paul team economically according to instructions\", though he hoped to have a stronger team in 1891. The Apostles finished in last place in 1890 with a 37-84 record.\nIn September 1890, with the St. Paul club losing money, C. L. Flatley, a personal friend of Watkins, purchased the club and promptly signed Watkins to serve as the club's manager again in 1891. However, Flatley had sold the club by December 1890. In June 1891, with the Apostles continuing to struggle financially and on the field, the club was sold and moved to Duluth, Minnesota. Two months later, in August 1891, the club disbanded, and Watkins was left with financial responsibility for half of the Duluth team's unpaid player salaries.\nRochester (1892).\nIn April 1892, Watkins was hired as the manager of the Rochester Flour Cities in the Eastern League and was described by \"The Sporting Life\" as \"a cuckoo\" who \"will not be handicapped by meddling directors.\" By the end of the season, the Rochester correspondent for \"The Sporting Life\" commended Watkins for his efforts with a \"misfit team\" that had a \"scarcity of good men\", was \"badly crippled\", suffered \"internal dissension\", and drew small crowds. The correspondent noted that Watkins had turned the club around with his emphasis on discipline: He has been as watchful of his men in the dark hours of the night as any man with self-respect could be, he has been always safe in his financial policy, his judgment of players has never gone wrong, he has been a stickler for finished team work ... He has been a dignified gentleman throughout and, considering the circumstances, the highest success as a manager... Local cranks will wish him unlimited success in every undertaking, and bear on with the hope that he may again pilot base ball in Rochester in 1893.\nSt. Louis (1893).\nIn 1893, Watkins was hired as the manager of the St. Louis Browns (later renamed the Cardinals) of the National League. Under owner Chris von der Ahe, the Browns had gone through five managers during the 1892 season, finishing in 11th place with a 56–94 (.373) record. Watkins remained the manager for the entire 1893 season and led the club to a 57-75 (.432) record and a 10th-place finish in 1893.\nSioux City (1894).\nIn 1894, Watkins was the manager of the Sioux City Cornhuskers in the newly formed Western League. He led the Sioux City club to the first Western League pennant with a 74–52 record. Four of his regular players (Lew Camp, Frank Genins, Lefty Marr and George Hogriever) hit .350 or higher, and pitcher Bert Cunningham won 35 games, but the \"Sporting Life\" gave much of the credit for the Huskers' championship to Watkins:Watkins' success as a manager is largely due to the discipline which he enforces and to his knowledge of the intricate points of the game. With him the national game has become as easy as the moves to an expert chess player. With the diamond in front of him every correct move of the men on the field is quickly discerned, and with the signals used so advantageously he is always in communication with the captain and players. Many of the Husker victories this season have been won by the silent man on the bench ...\nBy 1894, Watkins had won pennants as a manager in St. Thomas, Port Huron, Detroit and Sioux City, and had led teams in Indianapolis and Bay City to first place in seasons that ended prematurely; the \"Sporting Life\" at the time asserted that Watkins had \"the distinction of piloting more pennant winners than any other manager before the public to-day.\"\nIndianapolis, Part III (1895–98).\nFrom 1895 through the early part of the 1898 season, Watkins was the manager of the Indianapolis Hoosiers/Indians in the Western League.\nPittsburgh (1898–99).\nIn 1898, Watkins was hired as the manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Wasting the efforts of pitcher Jesse Tannehill (25–13 record and 2.95 ERA), the 1898 Pirates compiled a .258 team batting average (13 points below the league average) and finished in eighth place out of twelve teams with a 72–76 record. As he had been with other clubs, Watkins remained a strict disciplinarian as manager of the Pirates. \"The Sporting Life\" wrote: Watty is a firm base ball man, knows the practical side of the sport, and in the writer's recollection one of the few chiefs in the Pittsburg Club's employ who had courage to rebuke with spirit and determination players violating edicts, etc. Discipline prevails in his club. His iron-bound policy of directing plays of course cannot be popular with players, but if dictation is absent and appeal impossible the method may be pushed to success. Watkins also gained note while in Pittsburgh for his giving mandatory signs to each batter from the bench. One newspaper suggested that Watkins was turning his players into machines:The chief objection to the Watkins system is that it compels players to lose all individuality and become a mere portion of the machine that Watkins makes of his team. According to Walter Brodie, late of Pittsburg, and now of the Orioles, Watkins is the most autocratic of autocrats. He establishes rules that must be lived up to the letter, and no man on the team must have a mind of his own. ... Watkins success, then, lies in making machines of his men and thinking for them.\nWatkins described his sign system as follows: \"I have only four, one telling the player to sacrifice, the second for the hit and run game, the third to hit the ball out, and the fourth to bunt. This completes the list, and they are as simple as can be. But when I give a player instructions what to do he will obey or get out of the club.\"\nWatkins returned as the Pirates' manager in 1899 at an annual salary of $4,500, but he resigned in May 1899 after the team began the season with a 7-15 record. Watkins said at the time that he had other business to attend to, that he intended to quit baseball for good, and that he planned to return to his farm in Wadhams, Michigan: \"I am going back to the farm to see the horses and dogs. I have wanted to give up base ball for some time past. A turbulent life? I should say so. I will go into a quieter business.\"\nIndianapolis, Parts IV (1900–01).\nIn November 1899, Watkins purchased the Indianapolis Hoosiers of the American League from John T. Brush for \"something like $10,000.\" Watkins also leased land on the east side of Indianapolis and announced plans to build a new baseball field there. Speculation was immediate that Watkins was not a bona fide purchaser of the club and that he had \"purchased\" the club as a front man for Brush, who had been roundly criticized for his manipulations of the lineups of the two clubs (the Cincinnati Reds and Indianapolis Hoosiers) that he owned. Watkins also served as manager of the 1900 Indianapolis team, compiling a 71–64 record and finishing in third place. After American League president Ban Johnson converted the circuit into a major league, eliminating Indianapolis' spot in the league, Watkins was a leader of efforts in early 1901 to re-establish the American Association in competition with the American League. In January 1901, he was named chairman of the new league. The efforts to establish a new American Association were unsuccessful, and Watkins' Indianapolis club joined the Western Association for the 1901 season. He sold the club in July 1901, and it was moved to Matthews, Indiana.\nIndianapolis, Part V (190–03).\nIn late 1901, Watkins led renewed, and this time successful, efforts to re-establish a 20th-century version of the American Association with teams in Indianapolis, Louisville, Milwaukee, Kansas City, Columbus, Toledo and Minneapolis. In the early days of the new league, Watkins was credited with keeping the league from doing business with players who had jumped contracts with other teams and was called \"the prime mover in the events which finally resulted in peace between the American Association and the minor leagues.\" He became a one-half owner of the Indianapolis Indians in the American Association, and he also served as manager during the 1902 and 1903 seasons. Official records cite John Grim as manager of the 1902 team, but Watkins' biographer Bill Lamb wrote that Watkins fully exercised duties now associated with a team manager. Moreover, contemporaneous newspaper accounts in 1902 referred to Watkins as the team's manager. The 1902 Indians compiled a 96–45 record and won the first American Association pennant. After the pennant was secured, \"The Indianapolis Journal\" described Watkins' reaction:It is useless to mention him as Mr. W. H. Watkins. There are others of that name, while there is only one Watty. The exuberance of his eye, the thrill of enthusiasm in his voice and the general air of conquest surrounds him, told eloquently that Watty was happy. He leaned back in his mahogany chair in the pennant office in the Majestic building and illuminated every part of the room with his sunny countenance. He was in a benign mood, loquacious and enthusiastic.\nWatkins' 1903 team drew only 88,000 spectators, the lowest attendance in the American Association.\nMinneapolis (1904–05).\nIn November 1903, Watkins purchased the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association for $10,000. Watkins also served as the manager of the Minneapolis club during the 1904 and 1905 seasons. While managing the Millers, Watkins developed a reputation as a fierce competitor. \"The Minneapolis Journal\" in 1906 wrote: He has been in the business so long he has probably handled more players than any other man in baseball today. Some men in managing a team from the bench can do so in a calm manner, but 'Watty' was not one of these. He was 'in' the game just as much as any player ... It hurt him to lose games more than it did to lose money. Taking baseball so seriously threatened injury of a lasting nature to his nervous organization ... In October 1905, Watkins authored a lengthy article for \"The Minneapolis Journal\" outlining his views on the value of baseball as a game wherein \"brains must be combined with skill\", a game that \"demands temperance and proper living\", and \"as an element of great good in American life.\"\nIn December 1905, Watkins sold his ownership interest in the Minneapolis baseball club to Mike Kelley. The sale price was not disclosed but was \"said to be in the neighborhood of $50,000.\"\nIndianapolis, Part VI (1906–12).\nWatkins returned to Indianapolis in 1906 as manager of the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association. \"The Indianapolis Morning Star\" reported that local baseball fans were \"rejoicing\", and that Watkins was \"regarded as the most competent manager in the American Association.\" He had retained his half ownership interest in the Indianapolis club even while he was managing the Minneapolis team. He was also president of the club from 1906 to 1912. He stepped down as bench manager in May 1906, turning over responsibility of bench manager to Charlie Carr.\nAs of January 1912, Watkins owned interests in baseball clubs in three different leagues: the Indianapolis Indians in the American Association, the Springfield, Ohio club in the Central League, and the Newark, Ohio club in the Ohio State League. The Springfield and Newark clubs were both farm teams for the Indianapolis club. In February 1912, the \"Sporting Life\" reported that Watkins actually had a say in four minor league clubs and referred to him as the \"monarch of the minors.\"\nIn the spring of 1912, the \"Sporting Life\" published a report that Watkins had sold his interest in the Indianapolis club, and the \"Indianapolis Star\" reported that Watkins had been \"deposed\" as president of the Indianapolis team, tendering his resignation after refusing the demand from club owners to remove the manager, Jimmy Burke. The \"Star\" noted at the time:For more than thirty years he has been a prominent figure in baseball. He was one of the organizers of the American Association ... Mr. Watkins is a baseball man of the old school and he has been in the thick of all the grueling battles through which organized baseball has passed to bring it up to its present standard as one of the greatest amusement enterprises in the country. He has been through five baseball wars, and, as he says, 'went broke' in every one of them.\nWhile Watkins was generally regarded as a good judge of talent, he and manager Charlie Carr were criticized in hindsight for having sold Grover Cleveland Alexander (later inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame), Marty O'Toole and Buck O'Brien for a mere $750 while they were president and manager of the Indianapolis club.\nIndianapolis, Part VII: Federal League (1914).\nIn February 1914, Watkins was hired, at a salary reported to be $8,000, as the business manager for the Indianapolis Hoosiers team in the newly formed Federal League. Upon his hiring, \"The Sporting Life\" opined: \"William H. Watkins has served the game as player, manager, and magnate for three decades, with credit to himself and the sport, and his re-entrance in the Indianapolis field, where he labored for the greater part of his brilliant career, is absolutely certain to redound to the advantage of his new club and league.\" Watkins told the press: \"I know that Indianapolis, with its large suburban population, is large enough and has enough enthusiastic fans to support two base ball teams so long as there is no serious confliction in dates. I am glad to get back into the harness and particularly glad to return to Indianapolis.\"\nThe 1914 Hoosiers compiled an 88–65 record and won the first Federal League pennant, the first and only major league pennant in Indianapolis baseball history. However, in late March 1915, a deal was struck that resulted in the Indianapolis club being moved to Newark, New Jersey. Watkins did not follow the team to Newark.\nIn all, Watkins was affiliated with Indianapolis baseball clubs in seven different leagues: the 1884 Hoosiers in the American Association, the 1885 Hoosiers in the first version of the Western League, the 1895-98 Hoosiers/Indians in the second version of the Western League, the 1900 Hoosiers in the American League, the 1901 Hoosiers in the Central League, the 1903 and 1906–1910 Indians in the 20th century version of the American Association and the 1914 Hoosiers in the Federal League.\nPort Huron, Part II (1920–22).\nFrom 1920 to 1922, Watkins served as president of the Port Huron baseball club. In 1921, Watkins was one of the principal backers of the Port Huron club when it joined the Michigan–Ontario League. Watkins resigned the club's presidency in May 1922 in a letter stating that his business commitments prevented him from devoting the time needed for proper management of the club.\nFamily and later years.\nWatkins was married in 1884 to Edna Buzzard. They apparently had no children. Watkins became a naturalized United States citizen in 1897.\nAfter retiring from baseball, Watkins lived in Port Huron, Michigan, and worked as an executive at banks and land development and manufacturing companies. He also served as president of the Port Huron Chamber of Commerce and helped found the city of Marysville, Michigan, serving as the first village president and chairing the committee that incorporated Marysville into a city. He was elected justice of the peace in Marysville in 1933.\nWatkins died from diabetes in 1937 at age 79 in Port Huron, Michigan. He was survived by his wife, Edna, and was buried at Lakeside Cemetery in Port Huron. The field used by both the Port Huron semipro and high school baseball teams was named Watkins Field in his honor (though it ceased being used in the early 1940s). Watkins was inducted into the Port Huron Sports Hall of Fame in 2008."

        "text": "George C. Gibson (July 22, 1880 – January 25, 1967), nicknamed Mooney, was a Canadian professional baseball player, coach, scout, and manager. He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher from 1905 to 1918, most prominently for the Pittsburgh Pirates where he played the bulk of his career and was a member of the 1909 World Series winning team. Gibson spent the final two years of his career as a player-coach for the New York Giants. He later became a minor league manager for the Toronto Maple Leafs before returning to the major leagues as a manager for the Pirates and the Chicago Cubs.\nGibson played during a period in baseball history known as the Dead-ball era and, was regarded as one of the National League's premier catchers because of his impressive defensive skills and his strong, accurate throwing arm. He was also known for his smart pitch-calling and his ability to hold runners on base. His reputation as a defensive stand out is enhanced because of the era in which he played. In the deadball era, catchers played a huge defensive role, given the large number of bunts and stolen base attempts, as well as the difficulty of handling the spitball pitchers who dominated pitching staffs. He had to catch every type of pitch imaginable, such as shine balls, spitballs, knuckleballs, and emory balls.\nGibson was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1958, the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1987 and the London Sports Hall of Fame in 2002.\nPlaying career.\nBorn a stone's throw away from Tecumseh Park (today's Labatt Memorial Park) in London, Ontario, Gibson gained the nickname \"Mooney\" as a youngster. Some sources suggest that the nickname was inspired by his round, moon-shaped face, while other sources claim he picked up the nickname because he had played on a sandlot team known as the Mooneys. He began his professional baseball career in 1903 with the Buffalo Bisons of the Eastern League, managed by George Stallings. Numerous sources still associate Gibson with the Kingston Colonials of the Hudson River League but in a 1919 article, journalist Edward F. Balinger discusses this topic. Relaying something said by Gibson days earlier, he suggests that \"somebody got him mixed with some other player shortly after he broke into the big league.\" George spent parts of two seasons playing for the Montreal Royals before his contract was purchased by the Pittsburgh Pirates in June 1905.\nGibson made his major league debut July 2, 1905, at the age of 24. Gibson stood 5'11.5\" and weighed 190 pounds, which was considered large for a baseball player of his era. Although he did not provide prolific offensive statistics, he did provide excellent defensive abilities and was a keen student of baseball strategy under the tutelage of Pirates manager Fred Clarke. The Pirates finished in second place three times in four seasons between 1905 and 1908. During the 1908 season, they were involved in a tight pennant race with the Chicago Cubs and the New York Giants. The Pirates were in first place going into the final day of the season but lost their final game to the eventual National League champion Chicago Cubs.\nGibson was in his prime during the 1909 season when he caught in 134 consecutive games, breaking the previous record of 133 consecutive games played as a catcher set by Deacon McGuire in 1895. He set another major league record for games played in a season by a catcher with 150, which was also previously held by McGuire since 1895. His games caught in a season record stood until 1920 when Ray Schalk caught 151 games. His record of 134 consecutive games caught would stand until 1940 when it was broken by Ray Mueller. Gibson hit a double for the final hit in the last game played at Pittsburgh's Exposition Park on June 29, 1909, and the following day had the first hit in the new Forbes Field.\nGibson had a career-high 52 runs batted in and helped guide the Pirates' pitching staff to finish second in the league in shutouts as well as in earned run average as the team clinched the 1909 National League pennant. He also led National League catchers in fielding percentage, baserunners caught stealing and in caught stealing percentage. Gibson then went on to catch every game in the 1909 World Series as the Pirates defeated the Detroit Tigers in seven games to win the world championship. Gibson held Detroit's Ty Cobb, the premier base stealer of his era, to only one stolen base during the series (Cobb also stole home plate during the series which wasn't charged against Gibson). Arriving back at the train station in his hometown of London, Ontario, on October 27, 1909, after winning the World Series, Gibson found more than 7,000 cheering fans to greet him. At the time, the population of London was approximately 35,000.\nGibson was a workhorse during his career with the Pirates, leading National League catchers in games played for four consecutive seasons between 1907 and 1910. When Gibson began his major league career, most catchers were large, bulky men, however as baseball progressed during the Deadball era, the decrease in run production placed greater significance on stolen bases and bunts, which in turn emphasized the crucial defensive role played by catchers. As the sport evolved, teams began to field smaller, more agile players as catchers, typified by the emergence of Ray Schalk. A newspaper article of the day referred to Gibson as being part of the \"dreadnought\" type. He suffered a broken ankle in late-April of 1913 and missed two months of the season. Gibson returned to hit for a career-high .285 batting average in 102 games during the 1914 season. In August 1916 the 36-year-old Gibson was placed on waivers and claimed by the New York Giants, but he refused to report that year. Giants manager John McGraw persuaded him to join the Giants as a player-coach in 1917. Gibson played in his final major league game on August 20, 1918 at the age of 38.\nCareer statistics.\nIn a fourteen-year major league career, Gibson played in 1,213 games, accumulating 893 hits in 3,776 at bats for a .236 career batting average along with 15 home runs, 346 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .295. He had a .977 career fielding percentage as a catcher which was 7 points higher than the league average for catchers during his career. He led all National League catchers in fielding percentage three times (1909, 1910, and 1912). Gibson caught 124 shutouts during his career, ranking him 7th all-time among major league catchers. Gibson was the Pirates catcher on September 20, 1907, when pitcher Nick Maddox threw a no-hitter against the Brooklyn Superbas. In his book, \"The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract\", baseball historian Bill James ranked Gibson 95th all-time among major league catchers.\nBaseball managing career.\nGibson is also said to have accepted a coaching position with the Sacramento Solons of the Pacific Coast League in 1918. This can be traced at least as far back as a Sporting Life article from 1933, which notes that he agreed to terms with the club, but does not specify a position. This isn't true, and rather, Gibson, the catcher, is likely being confused with an amateur pitcher of the same name. Gibson, the catcher, remained with the Giants until the 1918 season closed because of World War I, and returned to Canada until he was hired in 1919 to coach the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League. In December 1919, Gibson was named the new manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. He served as their manager from 1920 to 1922. He then spent the 1923 season as a coach for the Washington Senators. In 1925, he became a coach for the Chicago Cubs, but finished the season as manager after Rabbit Maranville was dismissed. The following season (1926), he returned to his coaching capacities for the Cubs, then remained with the Cubs as a scout until he was again called upon by the Pirates, to manage the 1932 team. Although Gibson recorded a .546 winning percentage as a manager, he was intolerant of team mistakes and his temperament left him ill-suited for the task of team politics. On June 19, 1934, the Pirates replaced Gibson with Pie Traynor.\nOn May 9, 1921, under manager Gibson, the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the London Tecumsehs 8–7 at Tecumseh Park before 3,500 people in an exhibition baseball game. Before the game, Gibson and his team were presented with a silver loving cup by the London Kiwanis Club. Gibson thrilled the locals by catching the opening inning with his 1909 battery-mate Babe Adams and singling and scoring a run in his lone at-bat. London Mayor Sid Little entertained the team that evening at his home.\nPost-career honours.\nGibson was named Canada's baseball player of the half century in 1958 and was the first baseball player elected to Canada's Sports Hall of Fame. He was subsequently inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame &amp; Museum in the Class of 1987 and was one of the inaugural 10 inductees into the London Sports Hall of Fame in 2002. In February 1955 while organizers were planning the charter season of the Eager Beaver Baseball Association, Gibson was named \"honorary lifetime president.\" Today, there is a commemorative plaque prominently displayed at the entrance to the main grandstand at Labatt Park in Gibson's honour. An interview of Gibson was included as a chapter in the 1966 baseball book, \"The Glory of Their Times\", written by Lawrence Ritter.\nConnection to Labatt brewing family.\nWhen Gibson lived at 252 Central Avenue in London during the 1920s and 1930s, his immediate neighbours to the east were members of the Labatt brewing family, with whom Gibson frequently socialized. According to George Gibson's late nephew, George Lambourn, Gibson played a significant role in the decision by John and Hugh Labatt to purchase Tecumseh Park and donate it to the City (along with $10,000 for repairs and maintenance), which occurred on December 31, 1936, after which Tecumseh Park was officially renamed \"The John Labatt Memorial Athletic Park.\"\nGibson died at age 86 in London and is buried at Campbell Cemetery in Komoka, Ontario, not far from his Delaware farm. Gibson's former farm is on a road named in his honour after Gibson donated some land for public use to the area conservation authority of the day. Gibson was the nephew of William Southam, founder of Southam Newspapers, the brother of Richard Southam, manager of the London Tecumsehs, and the father-in-law of Bill Warwick, a major league baseball player in the 1920s."

        "text": "Robert Charles Anderson (born 7 November 1947) is an English former professional darts player who won the 1988 BDO World Darts Championship. Nicknamed The Limestone Cowboy, he was the World No. 1 player for over three years in the late 1980s.\nBefore darts.\nAnderson threw his first darts maximum (180) at the age of just seven. However, he was renowned as a champion athlete during his teenage years. He was picked as a javelin thrower in the British Olympic team of 1968, but broke his arm before the team left for Mexico, an injury which brought an end to his javelin-throwing career. He then turned his attention to football – playing to a moderately high standard for Lincoln United, Guildford City, Woking and Farnborough Town. During this time, he had continued to play darts socially and decided to take up the game more seriously when his injury jinx struck again – this time a broken leg in 1970 ended his football career.\nDarts success.\nAnderson had a long and successful darts career, winning the World Professional Championship in 1988 and the Winmau World Masters in 1986, 1987 and 1988 – the first man to win the Masters in three successive years. Only Martin Adams has since emulated this feat by winning the 2008, 2009 and 2010 tournaments.\nTwo years after his world title success he underwent surgery to fix a back problem that threatened his darts career. He returned to the game professionally but never reached the same heights he had achieved in the 1980s. Anderson was amongst the players who formed the Professional Darts Corporation – an organisation (originally known as the World Darts Council) which separated from the existing governing body, the British Darts Organisation in 1992–93. Anderson reached the final of the first WDC event, the Lada UK Masters, in November 1993 – losing to Mike Gregory.\nHis world ranking stayed sufficiently high to earn automatic qualification for most major PDC tournaments, and he went on to reach the semi-finals of the PDC World Darts Championship in 2004 and 2005.\nIn 1996, Anderson won the WDC World Pairs event alongside Phil Taylor. Anderson and Taylor defeated Chris Mason and Steve Raw in the final.\nAnderson was also the driving force behind the Bob Anderson Classic, a major darts tournament held every October. The tournament started in 2002 and ran until 2005.\nIn 2008, Anderson decided to take part in the BetFred League of Legends which was shown live on Setanta Sports and play along with the likes of Eric Bristow, Keith Deller, John Lowe and Dave Whitcombe. However, in doing so, he was forced to resign from the PDC to take part in the league. He does, however, remain a lifetime member of the PDPA, granted to him because he was a founder member of the WDC (now PDC). Anderson went on the capture the League of Legends title, beating Keith Deller in the final.\nOutside darts.\nBob married Sally Attwater on 8 April 2004 – he chose former World Champion dart player Eric Bristow as his best man. Anderson has two children, Jennie and David. He lists his hobbies as golf – with a handicap of six, and trout fishing. Anderson's sporting hero is golf legend Jack Nicklaus. Anderson lives in the Somerset sea-side resort town of Clevedon."

        "title": "Bruce Hood (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Bruce Melvin Hood (March 14, 1936 – January 5, 2018) was a Canadian author, businessman, politician, and a professional ice hockey referee in the National Hockey League (NHL).\nEarly life.\nHood was born in Campbellville, Ontario, Canada (now part of the Town of Milton) on March 14, 1936, and moved into Milton in 1947. In the late-1940s and 1950s, Hood wrote an occasional sports column for the Milton Canadian Champion newspaper; played for Milton junior and senior hockey clubs; was the statistician for the Milton Minor Hockey Association, the Milton Industrial Hockey League and the Central Ontario Hockey League; secretary of the Halton County Baseball Association; referee in chief of the Tri-County Hockey League and the Milton Referees' Association; as well as having played junior hockey with Oakville, Georgetown and Brampton, juvenile with Acton and commercial hockey in Burlington.\nHood officiated his first Intermediate hockey game in 1957 after a linesman was cut in a game he was serving as a back-up for. During the 1961-62 season, he served as a linesman in his first full season in the OHA Junior \"A\" league, before working in the 1962 Memorial Cup Finals between Hamilton and Edmonton.\nIn the fall of 1962, Hood left Milton to go officiate in the International Hockey League in the central U.S. before moving on to the NHL.\nAfter 1962-63 Hood joined the NHL pool of referees. Between 1963 and 1965, he handled Central, American and Western Hockey League games, before getting an NHL trial in 1966.\nOfficiating record.\nDuring his 21-year NHL career, Hood officiated 1,033 regular season games, 157 Stanley Cup playoff games, three All-Star Games, and three Canada Cups. He was the first professional to referee a World Championship game in 1985 in Prague, Czechoslovakia.\nAs an NHL referee, Hood was instrumental in the formation of the NHL Officials Association in 1969. After the NHL referees walked out of a training camp in Brantford, Ontario, six of the 20 referees continued to work out in Hood's hometown of Milton in late September 1969.\nHe was the last official to wear a number one on his jersey and the last to officiate in all Original Six arenas. In 1994, Hood was nominated to the Hockey Hall of Fame by 12 existing members, including former players like Bobby Hull and Maurice Richard. But, as of 2017, has not been elected as a member of the Hall.\nHood was the referee for Game 4 of the 1970 Stanley Cup Finals, when Boston Bruins legend Bobby Orr scored the Cup-winning goal 40 seconds into overtime by firing the puck past St. Louis Blues goalie Glenn Hall. Orr was tripped moments later by Blues defenceman Noel Picard, and the picture of Orr flying through the air became one of hockey's most iconic moments. The Mother's Day victory at Boston Garden gave Boston its first Cup since 1941.\nControversies.\nOne of the last NHL games Hood officiated was an infamous playoff match between the Montreal Canadiens and Quebec Nordiques on April 20, 1984, known as the Good Friday Massacre. The teams brawled for a full hour after the end of the second period. Hood's decision to continue the game was controversial, particularly when the announcement of penalties at the start of the third period provoked another brawl.\nHood was involved in another controversy during the 1984 playoffs. In Game 2 of the Campbell Conference finals between the Minnesota North Stars and Edmonton Oilers, Hood allowed a goal by the Oilers' Jari Kurri that proved to be the difference in a 4-3 Oiler victory, even though it appeared that the puck did not cross the goal line. Hood ruled that the puck had crossed the line while it was being cradled in the catching glove of North Stars goalie Don Beaupre. Edmonton would sweep the series by winning Games 3 and 4 in Bloomington, Minnesota en route to the franchise's first Stanley Cup championship.\nHe retired after the 1984 NHL playoffs.\nBusiness.\nFor eighteen years, Hood operated developmental camps for hockey officials, which attracted students from several countries, and designed a line of officiating equipment.\nHood operated a series of local travel agencies in the late 1980s and 1990s, serving as vice-chair of the Travel Industry Council of Ontario and president of the Association of Canadian Travel Agents. He was appointed as Air Travel Complaints Commissioner in the summer of 2000, and served until 2002. David Jeanes, the president of Transport 2000, claimed that Hood had accomplished \"an excellent job establishing this new consumer-protection office\". After leaving this position, he worked in mediation and marketing.\nHood authored two books, \"Calling the Shots\" in 1988 and \"The Good of the Game\" in 1999.\nPolitics.\nHe sought the Ontario Liberal Party nomination in Halton North for the 1987 election, and the federal Liberal nomination in Oakville—Milton in 1993, but lost both times (\"Guelph Mercury\", 29 June 2004).\nHood received 19,173 votes (38.21%) in the 2004 election running in the newly formed riding of Wellington—Halton Hills, finishing a close second against Conservative candidate Michael Chong.\nAwards.\nHood was inducted into the Milton Walk of Fame at the Milton Town Hall.\nIn November 2017, Hood was inducted into the Milton Sports Hall of Fame in the builder category. His sons accepted the honour on his behalf as he was in hospital battling cancer.\nDeath and legacy.\nHood died on January 5, 2018, from prostate cancer. In an interview with The Canadian Press, his son Kevin Hood offered this comment: \"He wanted to be the best at everything he did in his life, and refereeing was no exception. He would always say, 'You're only half right most of the time.' Half the crowd's with you and half the crowd's against you. The games when you weren't noticed, those were the best.\"\nNHL commissioner Gary Bettman said that \"Bruce Hood brought professionalism and integrity to every game he worked and earned the respect of the players, coaches, general managers — as well as his peers. In addition to his command of the game and his ability to communicate on the ice, Bruce had a characteristic calmness that brought his excellence to the fore when the pressure was greatest\"."

        "text": "Clifford \"Heathcliff\" Johnson, Jr. (born July 22, 1947) is an American former Major League Baseball player who played for the Houston Astros (1972–1977), New York Yankees (1977–1979), Cleveland Indians (1979–1980), Chicago Cubs (1980), Oakland Athletics (1981–82), Toronto Blue Jays (1983–84, 1985–1986) and Texas Rangers (1985). He batted and threw right-handed and split time between catcher, first baseman, and outfielder in the early part of his Major League career before becoming primarily a full-time designated hitter.\nCareer.\nAs a catcher at San Antonio's Wheatley High School in 1965, Johnson was the 83rd pick in the 1966 baseball draft by the Houston Astros. After six seasons in the minor leagues, he made his major league debut on September 13, 1972, and played for the Astros until partway through the 1977 season, when he was traded to the Yankees.\nJohnson was a member of the 1977 and 1978 Yankees World Series championship teams, both over the Los Angeles Dodgers. On April 19, 1979, following a Yankee loss to the Baltimore Orioles, Reggie Jackson started kidding Johnson about his inability to hit Goose Gossage. While Johnson was showering, Gossage insisted to Jackson that he struck out Johnson all the time when he used to face him, and that he was terrible at the plate. \"He either homers or strikes out\", Gossage said. He had previously given Johnson the nickname \"Breeze\" in reference to how his big swing kept Gossage cool on the pitcher's mound in hot weather. When Jackson relayed this information to Johnson upon his return to the locker room, all the players assembled, egged on by Jackson, started laughing at him and in unison loudly called him \"Breeze\" with some waving their arms and hands before doubling over. This infuriated Johnson and a fight started between him and Gossage. Gossage tore ligaments in his right thumb and missed three months of the season which cost the Yankees a chance to win their third consecutive World Series title. Yankees owner George Steinbrenner was furious and fined both Johnson and Gossage. Teammate Tommy John called it \"a demoralizing blow to the team.\" Johnson was traded to Cleveland two months after the brawl.\nAs a member of the Blue Jays in the mid-1980s, Johnson was a fan favorite at Exhibition Stadium until his retirement on September 30, 1986.\nIn a 15-season major League career, Johnson posted a .258 batting average with 196 home runs and 699 RBI in 1369 games played. Johnson held the MLB record for pinch hit home runs with 20 until he was surpassed by Matt Stairs in 2010.\nPersonal.\nJohnson is the brother-in-law of retired Major League left fielder Mike Easler."

        "title": "James Small (rugby union)",
        "text": "James Terence Small (10 February 1969 – 10 July 2019) was a South African rugby union winger who played for the Springboks. His international debut was against the All Blacks in 1992 and he made his final appearance against Scotland in 1997. In that final test match, he scored his 20th try, becoming the leading Springbok try scorer, eclipsing Danie Gerber's record. He was also the leading try scorer in the 1996 Super 12 season.\nEarly life and education.\nSmall was born in Cape Town to a working-class family, and attended Risidale Primary School and Greenside High School in Johannesburg, South Africa. He obtained Transvaal Colours for athletics and competed in the 100m and 400m when he was 16, but looking back said lacked the discipline in school required by athletics, preferring rugby as the fun alternative. He said he was offered the opportunity to go to San Diego State University for athletics but had to turn down the offer as his family could not afford for him to travel there. At school he was involved in association football, but was banned from the sport after a falling out with a referee, after which he turned to rugby. He was selected to represent the Transvaal school boys at Craven Week, earning a place in the South African schools boys side on the back of his performance there. Although he didn't go to university, he played for the Wits rugby club. In 1987 year he started playing for Transvaal, at the age of 18.\nRugby career.\nProvincial career.\nSmall played much of his provincial career under coach Harry Viljoen, following him from Transvaal to Natal in 1993, and to Western Province in 1998. That same year he returned to the Transvaal, then known as the Golden Lions, but \"had a string of discipline problems with former All Black coach Laurie Mains\". He played for the Cats in 1999, and retired after an injury.\nInternational career.\nHis first Test match in 1992 was the first for the Springboks at the dawn of the new, internationally acceptable South Africa following the release of Nelson Mandela and the unbanning of the ANC. He was one of the heroes of the Springbok team that won the 1995 Rugby World Cup and later that year experienced the transition of rugby from an amateur to a professional sport.\nAfter the fall of apartheid, when the Springboks were being taught the lyrics to the new South African national anthem, \"Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika\", Small was particularly enthusiastic about learning the lyrics. His response was that in his early days of playing rugby, he too was discriminated against, by Afrikaner players, for being of British descent rather than Dutch like they were. When the Springboks visited Robben Island on a tour, Small was very moved by what he saw and visibly wept, recalling later that \"Thinking about Mandela's cell and how he spent twenty-seven years in prison and came out with love and friendship. All that washed over me, that huge realization, and the tears just rolled down my face.\"\nSmall faced Jonah Lomu as his opposite man in the final of the 1995 World Cup. Lomu had scored four tries in New Zealand's semifinal against England, but Small and his teammates managed to contain Lomu, preventing him from scoring. The Springboks won the match and the Cup.\nSmall's career was marred by his verbal abuse of others on the rugby field, gaining notoriety as being the \"bad boy\" of the Springbok team.\nHe became the first Springbok to ever be sent off, as a result of dissent towards referee Ed Morrison in the second test against Australia in 1993. In later years Small acknowledged that he felt he had let a lot of people down but that he was sent off as a result of an accumulation of incidents in the team. He faced a Springboks disciplinary hearing, but was selected for the third test match the following week.\nSmall was also alleged by his teammate Chester Williams to have uttered racist abuse towards him, though as an opponent in provincial rugby, not as a Springbok teammate.\nWorld Cup matches.\n Champions Runners-up Third place Fourth place\nPost rugby life, career and business interests.\nDuring his time as rugby player, Small worked as a model and became something of a sporting sex symbol. In a 2018 interview with John Robbie on the Sport Exchange, he lamented not making more of the opportunities presented to him, and regretted not having someone helping him to professionally manage and market his image and brand, which he saw as being available to international overseas sports icons. He did not know how to handle the money and opportunities that were available to him at the time, and he admitted once spending all the money he had earned on six Armani suits, instead of his career management.\nHe was involved in the building industry, renovating houses. He also owned a number of restaurants including having opened Café Caprice in Camps Bay.\nHe was also involved in commentating, and in coaching the game. Small was involved with the Investec Rugby Academy, before being appointed Pukke assistant coach for the 2014 Varsity Cup. He then joined the Leopards in the Currie Cup First Division as coaching consultant. He was also involved in an online podcast \"The elephant in the room\" on rugby commentary with Darren Scott. The 50th birthday episode is available online.\nIn his personal life he was involved in a long term relationship with Christina Storm. She is a well known local celebrity, and the tabloids regularly reported on their relationship, which was tumultuous. Christina Storm (now Storm-Nel), with whom he has a daughter, Ruby Small, has since married and has other children. He has publicly acknowledged and apologised for his abusive treatment of her, including in two incidents which turned physically violent. These claims were denied and proved untrue by Storm in an interview for ‘YOU’ magazine in 2020. He also sought therapy for a period of two years. He has said he has been arrogant and petulant, and it resulted in losing the love of his life. There was a publicised court battle over custody of his daughter.\nHe also attempted suicide in 2001, following the break up and was hospitalised and sectioned under South Africa's Mental Health Care Act for 3 months. He has also admitted misusing alcohol and cocaine, and had major struggles with alcohol misuse. President Nelson Mandela reportedly telephoned him personally and asked him what happened following his hospitalisation. The President listened to him and then simply said, \"I know what it feels like if you think people have forgotten about you. I went through it as well in my time in prison.\" The two men were said to have a personal relationship. Small felt this helped him gain some perspective on his problems, and he was moved by the President's humanity in reaching out to him.\nHe attributed his recovery to his great friendships and his commitment to his, at the time, newborn daughter.\nDeath.\nSmall died in hospital on Wednesday morning on 10 July 2019, at the age of 50, after suffering a heart attack while having drinks at The Harem, a strip club in Johannesburg. Club co-owner, Jerome Saffi, confirmed that Small had collapsed while having drinks at the bar. An autopsy revealed the cause of death as ischemic heart disease, and the police investigation into the circumstances surrounding his death revealed no suspicious circumstances.\nSmall's memorial was held at the Wanderers Rugby Field, and was open to all mourners. Former Springboks who attended included James Dalton, Kobus Wiese, Pierre Spies, Rudolf Straeuli, John Smit and Stefan Terblanche. Current Springbok captain Siya Kolisi was also there, as was Small's former partner, Christina Storm.\nSmall was survived by his son (9) and daughter (15), his sister and his mother. The South African Rugby Legends Association established a fundraising initiative in aid of James Small's family.\nTributes and legacy.\nHis record on the field, and the very many tributes from the sporting fraternity, amongst others, speak for themselves. Some examples are cited below:\n\"The African National Congress (ANC) is shocked and saddened by the passing of former Springbok player, James Small.\"\n\"He was a member of the legendary South African Rugby squad that won the World Cup in 1995, a year after the ushering in of a democratic government in South Africa. The class of 1995 contributed enormously towards uniting the nation and displaying to the world South Africa’s sporting prowess. James Small was a patriot who fought like a soldier in the field of play and was prepared to die with his boots on. He played with extraordinary passion and commitment, for he knew that everytime he walked onto the field, he carried the hopes of the nation on his shoulders. The ANC conveys its heartfelt condolences to his family, friends and the entire sporting world.\"\nThe All Blacks referred to him as a Springbok great and the 1995 Rugby World Cup winner, and went on to say he was \"\"\"a \"fierce competitor on the field and great friend off it, James will be missed by the entire global rugby community.\" \"Rest In Peace, legend.\"\" The Wallabies also acknowledged him as a legend. The widow of Jonah Lomu also acknowledged his death."

        "text": "Acheta domesticus, commonly called the house cricket, is a cricket most likely native to Southwestern Asia, but between 1950 and 2000 it became the standard feeder insect for the pet and research industries and spread worldwide. They can be kept as pets themselves, as this has been the case in China and Japan.\nDescription.\nThe house cricket is typically gray or brownish in color, growing to in length. Males and females look similar, but females will have a brown-black, needle-like ovipositor extending from the center rear, approximately the same length as the cerci, the paired appendages towards the rear-most segment of the cricket. On males, the cerci are more prominent.\nDiet.\nThe house cricket is an omnivore that eats a range of plant and animal matter. Crickets in the wild consume flowers, leaves, fruits, grasses and other insects (including dead members of their own species). Crickets in captivity will accept fruits (e.g. apples, oranges, bananas), vegetables (e.g. potatoes, carrots, squash, leafy vegetables), grains (e.g. oatmeal, cornmeal, cooked corncobs, alfalfa, wheat germ, rice cereal), various pet foods and commercial cricket food.\nLife cycle.\nHouse crickets take two to three months to complete their life cycle at . They have no special overwintering stage, but can survive cold weather in and around buildings, and in dumps where heat from fermentation may sustain them. Eggs are deposited in whatever moist substrate is available. Juveniles resemble the adults except for being smaller and wingless.\nDiseases.\nThe house cricket was essentially eliminated from the cricket-breeding industries of North America and Europe by the appearance of cricket paralysis virus which spread rapidly in Europe in 2002 and then in the United States in 2010. The virus is extremely lethal to this species of cricket and a few others, and left many hobbyists and researchers without adequate feeder insects. It has been replaced by the Jamaican field cricket, which is resistant to cricket paralysis virus and has many of the desirable features of the house cricket.\nAs food.\nThe house cricket is an edible insect. It is farmed in South-East Asia and parts of Europe and North America for human consumption. In Asia, it is said to become more popular than many native cricket species due to what consumers claimed was their superior taste and texture. Dry-roasting is common and is considered the most nutritious method of preparing them, though they are often sold deep-fried as well. Farmed house crickets are mostly freeze-dried and often processed into a powder known as cricket flour. In Europe, the house cricket is officially approved for use in food products in Switzerland (since 2017) and in the European Union member states (since 2022). In the EU, the house cricket was approved as novel food in frozen, dried and powdered forms with the \"Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/188 of 10 February 2022\". Before that, the European Food Safety Authority had published a safety assessment on August 17, 2021, stating that frozen and dried formulations from whole house crickets are safe for consumption.\nNutritional value.\nHouse crickets are an incomplete protein source, deficient in tryptophan and lysine. They contain both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids."

In the semi-final, they beat Japan and New Zealand to qualify behind Canada. They went into the final with three objectives: to stay on their feet (to avoid a repeat of what happened in Albertville), to remain undisqualified, and to beat at least one of the other three finalists. With 21 of 45 laps to go, a Canadian crashed into the side, and was out of contention. With 12 laps to go, Italian Mirko Vuillermin accelerated away, creating a gap such that Australia was unlikely to win gold. Until the last change, it seemed that Australia might win silver. Nizielski was the final skater, and said later that \"At the last change [American] Eric Flaim got a good push-away and he stepped underneath my feet and stopped me. I thought, well I'm not going to fight him for this. I didn't want to let the team down. And I was very aware that I had taken a fall in Albertville. I just wanted to get through and get the medal.\" Team member Steven Bradbury went on to win Australia's first winter gold in 2002."

        "title": "1958 Asian Games",
        "text": "The 1958 Asian Games, officially the Third Asian Games () and commonly known as Tokyo 1958, was a multi-sport event held in Tokyo, Japan, from 24 May to 1 June 1958. It was governed by the Asian Games Federation. A total of 1,820 athletes representing 20 Asian National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in the Games. The program featured competitions in 13 different sports encompassing 97 events, including four non-Olympic sports, judo, table tennis, tennis and volleyball. Four of these competition sports – field hockey, table tennis, tennis and volleyball – were introduced for the first time in the Asian Games.\nThis is the first time that Japan hosted the Asian Games.\nBackground.\nThe Asian Games is a multi-sport event, much like the Summer Olympics (albeit on a much smaller scale), with participation exclusively for Asian countries. The first edition was held in the capital city of India, New Delhi, in 1951, attracting 489 competitors from 11 nations.\nSports.\nThe programme for the Tokyo 1958 Games included 13 different sports divided into 97 events. Four of these sports – judo, table tennis, tennis and volleyball – were not on the official Olympic sports programme at that time. Badminton was added as a demonstration sport, which, from 1962 onwards, became a regular competitive sport in the Asian Games. Judo was another demonstration sport.\nTorch relay.\nThe tradition of torch relay, inspired by the Olympic Games, was introduced for the first time in the Asian Games in 1958. The relay officially began from the main venue of the Second Asian Games, Rizal Memorial Coliseum, in Manila, Philippines. In the host nation, Japan, it was relayed from Okinawa to Kyushu Island. Okinawa was under the United States administration at that time. At the opening ceremony, the Games cauldron was ignited by the first Japanese Olympic gold medallist and the first Asian Olympic champion in an individual event, Mikio Oda.\nParticipating nations.\nA record total of 1,820 athletes representing 20 member nations of the Asian Games Federation participated in the Games. The number of participating countries was also greatest in comparison to the first two editions of the Games.\nThe Thai delegation held a meeting on 22 May 1958 in Tokyo, and invitations were sent to the representatives of Malaysia, Burma and Laos. The agenda of the meeting was to discuss the possibility of forming a regional multi-sport event on the lines of Asian Games for the countries of Southeast Asia. This way the Southeast Asian Peninsular Games (SEAP Games), which later became the Southeast Asian Games, were established and the first SEAP Games were held in Bangkok, Thailand, in 1959.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony of the Tokyo 1958 Games was organised on 24 May 1958 at the National Olympic Stadium. The ceremony, among other dignitaries and guests, included the Emperor of Japan Hirohito, crown prince Akihito and Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Around 70,000 people attended the opening ceremony.\nCalendar.\nIn the following calendar for the 1958 Asian Games, each blue box represents an event competition, such as a qualification round, on that day. The yellow boxes represent days during which medal-awarding finals for a sport were held. The numeral indicates the number of event finals for each sport held that day. On the left, the calendar lists each sport with events held during the Games, and at the right, how many gold medals were won in that sport. There is a key at the top of the calendar to aid the reader.\nMedal table.\nAthletes from 16 countries won medals, leaving four countries without a medal, and 11 of them won at least one gold medal. Afghanistan, Cambodia, Nepal and North Borneo did not win any medal. The Japanese 4 × 100 metres medley relay team of Keiji Hase (backstroke), Masaru Furukawa (breaststroke), Manabu Koga (freestyle) and Takashi Ishimoto (butterfly) won the gold medal with a time of 4:17.2 and broke the world record.\nThe ranking in this table is consistent with International Olympic Committee convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a nation is an entity represented by a NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next, followed by the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given; they are listed alphabetically by IOC country code.\nThe top ten ranked NOCs at these Games are listed below. The host nation, Japan, is highlighted."

        "text": "Bruce Oram Davidson (born December 31, 1949, in Rome, New York) is an American equestrian who competes in the sport of eventing. He grew up in a family uninterested in horses, but began to compete in Pony Club events after a family friend introduced him to riding. He began college at Iowa State University, but left in his third year to train full-time with the United States Equestrian Team. In 1974, he married, and his two children were born in 1976 and 1977. His son, Bruce Davidson Jr., has followed in his footsteps to become a top eventing rider.\nAt 18, Davidson tried out for the United States eventing team and was accepted. He won his first medal as a member of the silver-medal-winning US team at the 1972 Summer Olympics. After that, Davidson went to win gold at the 1976 and 1984 Olympics and silver in 1996, participating unsuccessfully in 1988. He has also competed repeatedly at both the World Equestrian Games and the Pan American Games, winning medals at both, as well as winning repeatedly at the top-level Badminton Horse Trials and Rolex Kentucky Three Day events. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Davidson was a consistently top-level rider on both the American and international eventing scenes. He is also known for his horse breeding and training abilities.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1949, Davidson was born to Francis and Annette Davidson, the former a businessman and the latter a concert pianist. He was the third of four children, and had little opportunity to be around horses until his family moved to Westport, Massachusetts, when he was a child. A family friend introduced Davidson to horses, and he began attending Pony Club events. He bought, trained and sold horses until he found a championship horse in Irish Cap, the horse that took him to his first gold medal at the 1974 World Eventing Championship. Davidson went to college at Iowa State University with a veterinary major, but left in his third year to train with the United States Equestrian Team (USET).\nIn 1974, Davidson married Carol Hannum, a top rider and daughter of Nancy Hannum, who owns extensive property in Pennsylvania surrounding Davidson's Chesterland Farm. In 1976, Davidson's son, Bruce \"Buck\" Oram Davidson, Jr., was born, followed by a daughter, Nancy Fraser Davidson, in 1977. In 2006, Davidson's first grandson, Oram, was born to Nancy. Buck Davidson is also an internationally competitive event rider, competing in high-level events such as the Rolex Kentucky Three Day along with his father.\nIn 2002, at a competition in Massachusetts, Davidson's horse suffered a fall in a freak accident. The horse, High Scope, broke his neck and died instantly, while Davidson was taken to the intensive care unit at Massachusetts Memorial Hospital. After being treated for injuries, Davidson was released. In 2010, Davidson missed that year's Rolex Three Day Event in Kentucky after undergoing surgery to repair herniated discs in his back.\nCareer.\nCompetition.\nAt 18, Davidson participated in a tryout for aspiring eventers run by Neil Ayer and Jack le Goff, who were trying to build the United States team to an international level. He had talent, and according to LeGoff, \"He didn't know which diagonal he was posting when he came to me. Two years later, he was riding in the Olympics.\" Davidson was chosen, and began training with the USET in a four-year, seven-day-a-week program in Gladstone, New Jersey.\nDavidson won team eventing medals at Olympic Games in 1972, 1976, 1984 and 1996, and also competed at the 1988 Games. In the 1972 Games, at age 22, he took individual eighth, while the American team won silver. At the 1976 Summer Olympics, the team won gold while Davidson came in tenth individually. In 1984, Davidson, who finished 13th individually, was the lowest scoring member of the gold-medal-winning United States team. At the 1988 Games, Davidson took 18th, while the American team did not finish the competition. In 1996, Davidson did not compete as an individual, but the American team again took silver.\nOutside of the Olympics, Davidson also competed repeatedly at the Eventing World Championships and the Pan-American Games. He took both an individual and a team gold at the 1974 World Championships, and another individual gold at the 1978 Championships. Davidson's victory at the 1974 Championships aboard Irish Cap made him the first American ever to win the event, and his win in 1978 aboard Might Tango made him the first rider of any nationality to win back-to-back championships. In this event, the inexperienced Might Tango was Davidson's backup horse after Irish Cap went lame, leading to a scenario which \"Sports Illustrated\" likened to \"a junior high school quarterback leading USC to victory in the Rose Bowl\". Might Tango's inexperience led to increased tiredness and rumors that the activity made him go into shock, but Davidson replied that the horse was just \"very tired\" and praised him for his stamina. The United States also took a team bronze at the 1978 championships. In 1990, Davidson took an individual bronze at the World Championships in Stockholm, Sweden. In 1998, Davidson competed at the World Equestrian Games in Rome, where he took an individual 21st place, as well as helping the US to a team 4th.\nAt the 1975 Pan American Games, he took both the individual and the team silver; he followed this up by an individual gold and a team silver at the 1995 Games.\nHe has also ridden at the Badminton Horse Trials, where he is one of only two Americans to win that event, and he also holds the honor of having the most wins at the Rolex Three Day Event with six victories. Through his 1974 World Championship victory, Davidson is credited with helping to create the Rolex event, as this victory allowed the US to host the 1978 World Championships. The 1978 event turned into an annual competition that eventually became the Rolex Kentucky Three-Day, which was the first and continues to be the only four-star eventing competition in the United States. Davidson has competed at the event almost every year since it began.\nIn 1993 and 1995, Davidson held the top place in the world eventing rankings compiled by the FEI, and between 1980 and 1995, he was annually named the leading rider for the United States Eventing Association.\nOther.\nIn 2002, Davidson was named as one of the 50 most influential horsemen of the 20th century by the equine magazine \"The Chronicle of the Horse\". In 2009, Davidson was inducted to the United States Eventing Association Hall of Fame, along with his horse Irish Cap. In 2003, another horse ridden by Davidson, Plain Sailing, had also been inducted.\nDavidson is also known for his success in finding and training the horses that he rides at the international level. Irish Cap was purchased at the age of five years, JJ Babu and Dr. Peaches as yearlings and Might Tango as a two-year-old ex-racehorse – all ended as championship horses. He is currently a Thoroughbred breeder, and at his Chesterland Farm he says that \"the ultimate in the sport is to breed, train and win, to carry the whole system right on through.\""

        "text": "The 1962 Asian Games () also known as the 4th Asian Games, IV Asiad, and Jakarta 1962, was the fourth edition of pan-Asian multi-sport event sanctioned by the Asian Games Federation (AGF). The games were held from 24 August to 4 September 1962, in Jakarta, Indonesia. It was the first international multi-sport event hosted by the then-17-year-old Southeast Asian country. This was the first of two Asian Games hosted by the city: the second was held in 2018, with Palembang as the co-host.\nIsrael and the Republic of China (ROC) were excluded from the Games, as in solidarity with People's Republic of China and fellow-Muslim majority countries in the Middle East, Indonesian immigration officials refused to issue entry visas for the Israeli and Taiwanese delegations.\nIt was a breach of the rules of the AGF, and Indonesia's own promise to invite all AGF members, including those with whom it had no diplomatic relations (Israel, ROC and the Republic of Korea).\nAs a result, Indonesia was suspended from the International Olympic Committee, and were subsequently excluded from the 1964 Summer Olympics. Indonesia responded to this punishment by hosting the Games of the New Emerging Forces in 1963.\nA total number of 1,460 athletes, coming from 17 countries, competed in this Asiad, where badminton made its debut.\nBid.\nOn 23 May 1958, voting for the 1962 host took place in Tokyo, Japan, before the 1958 Asian Games. The Asian Games Federation council voted 22–20 in favour of the Indonesian capital over Pakistani city of Karachi, the only other candidate.\nGames perceived as Indonesian pride.\nIndonesia, only recently out from the shackles of colonialism, saw the fourth Asian games as its national pride. On 9 April 1961, President Sukarno, while referring to these games, said in Bandung:\nKeeping this principle in mind, it acquired a loan of 12.5 million US dollars from Russia. With the help of Russian experts, a giant stadium was built, which could accommodate 100,000 spectators. Jakarta was renovated, and the efforts at renewal included complete removal of beggars and prostitutes. Indonesian pride was so high at that time, that it did not invite Israel and Taiwan despite both being members of the Asian Games Federation [AGF].\nVenues.\nAll but three official sports were held inside or around the Gelora Bung Karno Sports Complex, temporarily called the Asian Games Complex. The shooting event was held in Cibubur Shooting Range, in what is now lies within East Jakarta. The weightlifting and wrestling events were held at Ikada Sports Hall, now demolished to make way for the National Monument. The nearby Ikada Stadium was also used for football event, as well as Tebet football pitch, located southeast of the complex. The archery demonstration event was held at Menteng Stadium.\nSports.\nWhile Weightlifting was in the program, the IWF withdrew recognition of the Asian Games competition after the Indonesian federation barred Taiwan and Israel from taking part. \nParticipating nations.\nAthletes from 15 nations competed at the Jakarta Games.\nMedal table.\nThe top ten ranked NOCs at these Games are listed below. The host nation, Indonesia, is highlighted.\nBroadcasting.\nIn Indonesia, a television station TVRI was established by the Indonesian government to broadcast the games for the general public, which was the first in the country. The station would become the main channel of TVRI network; and its first airdate, which coincides with the opening ceremony, become the network's founding date."

        "title": "Charlie Gardiner (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Charles Robert Gardiner (December 31, 1904 – June 13, 1934) was a Scottish-born Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Chicago Black Hawks in the National Hockey League. Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, Gardiner moved with his family to Canada as a child. Playing all of his junior hockey in or around Winnipeg, Manitoba, Gardiner joined the Black Hawks in 1927. He played seven seasons with Chicago, winning two Vezina Trophies for allowing the fewest goals, was named to the First All-Star Team three times and Second All-Star Team once in recognition as one of the best goalies in the league. In 1934, Gardiner became the only NHL goaltender to captain his team to a Stanley Cup win. A few months after winning the Cup, Gardiner died from a brain hemorrhage brought on by a tonsillar infection. When the Hockey Hall of Fame was established in 1945, Gardiner was named one of the inaugural inductees.\nPersonal life.\nGardiner was born in Edinburgh, Scotland to John and Janet Gardiner. The fourth of five children, there were also Gardiner's two older brothers, John and Alexander, an older sister, Edith, and a younger sister, Christina. The family emigrated to Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1911, when Gardiner was seven. Initially they lived in a house on William Avenue before moving to Alexander Street; both streets were south of the railways, and were full of Scottish-Irish working-class families. John took a job as a rail car repairer, and Gardiner took an early interest in the trains, often waiting up late at night to watch them arrive in the city. He was enrolled at the Albert School, and befriended Wilf Cude, who had immigrated from Wales who would later play in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a goaltender.\nWhen the First World War began in 1914, both of Gardiner's brothers enlisted and were sent overseas. Gardiner's father John also enlisted, but he died May 30, 1916, before he was sent overseas. Both his brothers returned home after the war ended; while Alex was unharmed, John had been involved in a poison gas attack, and was seriously ill. To help provide for the family Gardiner began working for the J.H. Ashdown Hardware Company at the age of twelve. In December 1928 John began to develop an illness as a result of his poison gas attack in the war, and died December 13. Edith had planned to get married on December 31, but wanted to delay the marriage because of John's death, though her family convinced her to continue with the original plan. Gardiner married Myrtle Brooks August 6, 1927 at Grace United Church in Winnipeg. Their first son, Robert Roy, was born May 20, 1929. They also had a girl on May 7, 1931, but she died the same day.\nWhile working at the hardware store, Gardiner first played organised sports as a member of the store's baseball team. Gardiner quickly started playing ice hockey with the same passion as the children who were born in Canada. As he didn't learn to skate until he was eight years old, he couldn't skate very fast and was forced to play as the goaltender. He had tried to play as a forward and defenceman but was too slow for either position. Playing on Winnipeg's frozen ponds, Gardiner employed an acrobatic style, instead of the nearly-universal stand-up style played in that era, to avoid having his hands and feet frostbitten. He joined the Victorias, a team in the Winnipeg City League, at the age of 13. He recorded a shutout in his first game, but the team was shut out in their following game, so Gardiner was cut. By the age of 14, Gardiner made the intermediate team of the Selkirk Fishermen.\nAside from hockey, Gardiner excelled in Canadian football and had joined the Winnipeg Tammany Tigers junior club in 1920. As a defender, Gardiner quickly gained attention for his skill and helped the Tigers reach the Western Canadian junior rugby championship in Regina, Saskatchewan, though they lost the championship game. The following year he changed positions and played as a right outer wing; the Tigers went through the season undefeated and again played in the Western Canadian championship game, which was held in Regina like the previous year; the team again lost. While with the Tammany Tigers Gardiner played in the 13th Grey Cup, the Canadian football championship, losing against the Ottawa Senators 24–1.\nOutside of hockey, Gardiner enjoyed several different hobbies. During one off-season from the Black Hawks, Gardiner began taking flying lessons from his former teammate Konrad Johannesson. He quickly learned how to fly solo and would buy shares in the Winnipeg Flying Club, which Johannesson had founded. He also enjoyed shooting rifles; in the summer of 1931 he was recognised for this when he was elected Field Secretary of the Winnipeg Gun Club. The following summer Gardiner earned a certificate in business administration and sales from the International Correspondence Schools. He then became a partner in a sporting goods business and travelled across Western Canada in the summer to sell products to sports teams. Gardiner attended church services at Grace United Church in Winnipeg, which had hosted his wedding. He was also a Freemason, and joined the St. John's Lodge in Winnipeg on April 21, 1926. During the summer of 1933, he was selected as a Shriner at the Lodge; at the age of 29 he was the youngest Shriner in the city.\nPre-NHL career.\nGardiner played junior ice hockey with the Winnipeg Tigers of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League (MJHL) for three seasons, from 1921 to 1924. He joined the Selkirk Fishermen senior team for the 1924–25 season. The Fishermen played in the highest amateur league in Manitoba and were finalists for the championship the year before. Gardiner appeared in 18 games for Selkirk, posting two shutouts and a 1.83 goals against average. They again reached the finals but lost to the Port Arthur Bearcats. The loss made Gardiner feel dejected and ashamed, though people assured him he had played well and had several offers for different teams. He decided to join the professional Winnipeg Maroons of the Central Hockey League (CHL). As he would be a professional, Gardiner was forced to give up his baseball career, which he was reluctant to do; he finished with a career batting average of .300. Playing two seasons in Winnipeg, Gardiner appeared in 74 games, posting 12 shutouts, and 2.14 and 2.16 goals-against average in the two seasons, respectively.\nChicago Black Hawks.\nGardiner joined the Chicago Black Hawks in the 1927–28 season. In his first season with the Black Hawks, Gardiner played in 40 out of 44 of Chicago's games. Recording a 2.83 goals average, Gardiner won or tied only eight games, with three of those games being shutouts. The following season, Gardiner appeared in all 44 games for Chicago. Known as the NHL's \"goalless wonders\", Chicago scored only 33 goals the entire season, finishing with a 7–29–8 record. Gardiner had five shutouts and a 1.85 goals against average that season. During a game against the New York Rangers on February 3, 1929 WJ Holmes, manager of the Maroons came to Chicago to watch Gardiner play. The Rangers won the game 3–2 though Gardiner played well. Even so, Frederic McLaughlin, owner of the Hawks, offered to sell him back to Winnipeg for $3500. Only after Barney Stanley and Hugh Lehman talked to McLaughlin did he back down on the deal. After being booed by the Chicago fans, Gardiner nearly retired, before being talked out of it by Duke Keats.\nAfter the NHL changed its rules to allow forward passing in the offensive zone in the 1929–30 season, goal scoring increased league-wide. While Chicago increased its goals scored to 117, Gardiner's goals against average rose by only 0.57, to 2.42. Gardiner's total number of shutouts fell by two, from five to three. Chicago improved its regular season record to 21–18–15, placing second in the American Division, and making the playoffs. In the playoffs, the Black Hawks lost to the Montreal Canadiens 3–2 in a two-game, total-goal series, losing and tying one game. In the 1930–31 season, Chicago placed, once more, second in the American Division, with a 24–17–3 record. Gardiner recorded one of his best statistical years, recording a league-leading 12 shutouts to go with a 1.73 goals against average. Late in December 1930 the New York Americans offered $10,000 to the Hawks in exchange for Gardiner, double his salary; McLaughlin refused the offer. He was also named, for the first time, to the First All-Star Team. In the playoffs, Chicago advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals, losing once more to the Montreal Canadiens, three games to two. Posting a 5–3–2 record in the playoffs, Gardiner had another two shutouts and a 1.32 goals against average.\nIn the 1931–32 season, Chicago finished with an 18–19–11 regular season record. Gardiner recorded four shutouts and a 1.85 goals against average. Gardiner was named to the First All-Star Team, and won the Vezina Trophy for the first time, becoming the first goalie who caught right-handed to do so. Placing second in the American Division for the third season in a row, the Black Hawks lost a two-game, total-goal series 6–2 to the Toronto Maple Leafs. Gardiner won one game and lost one during the playoffs, with one shutout and a 3.00 goals against average. In the 1932–33 season, Chicago missed the playoffs, with a 16-20-12 record, placing fourth in the American Division. Gardiner recorded five shutouts, with a 2.01 goals against average. He was named to the Second All-Star Team for the only time in his career.\nBefore the beginning of the 1933–34 season, Gardiner's teammates unanimously elected him captain. During the regular season, Chicago finished with a 20–17–11 record. Gardiner had 10 shutouts, and a 1.63 goals against average. He was named for the third time to the First All-Star Team, and won the Vezina Trophy for the second time. On February 14, 1934, he was a participant in the Ace Bailey Benefit Game, playing goaltender for the All-Stars, who played against the Maple Leafs. In the playoffs, Gardiner had a 6–1–1 record, with two shutouts and a 1.33 goals against average, as Chicago won the Stanley Cup for the first time in franchise history. During the Stanley Cup parade, Chicago defenseman Roger Jenkins carted Gardiner in a wheelbarrow around Chicago's business district after a pre-playoff bet.\nIllness and death.\nDuring the 1932–33 season Gardiner began to develop a tonsil infection that drained his strength. While he initially kept the infection private, Gardiner made his condition public on December 23, 1932. Even though he was ill, Gardiner played the next night in Toronto. Though his fifty-five saves were the deciding factor in the Black Hawks win and his performance was so good that both league President Frank Calder and Maple Leafs star forward Charlie Conacher praised him, he was so sick he would collapse on the dressing room floor in between periods with a fever of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit; after the game Gardiner was rushed to a local hospital. This was the first notable symptom of Gardiner's health issues.\nIn January 1934 the Black Hawks were on a train back to Chicago when Gardiner felt an intense pain in his throat that spread to the rest of his body, notably his kidneys. When questioned by Tommy Gorman about his issue, Gardiner lied to Gorman and insisted it was only a minor headache. However, when Gardiner woke up on the train in the morning, he had trouble seeing, as black spots obscured his vision. This was Gardiner's first uremic convulsion.\nGardiner's health continued to be an issue throughout the 1934 NHL playoffs. On March 29, 1934 in a playoff game against the Montreal Maroons Gardiner had a shutout as the Black Hawks won 3–0; though he was named first star as the best player of the game, Gardiner was in extreme pain during the entire game with a fever of 102 Fahrenheit and was attended to by a doctor in the dressing room during intermissions.\nPlaying with a tonsillar infection for most of the season, Gardiner was often slumped over his crossbar during breaks in games, nearly blacking out. After leaving for a singing lesson on June 10, 1934, Gardiner, a baritone, collapsed. He went into a coma, from which he never woke. Gardiner died on June 13, 1934, in Winnipeg, from a brain hemorrhage brought on by the infection.\nIn a \"Montreal Gazette\" story about Gardiner's untimely death that ran on June 14, 1934, Detroit general-manager Jack Adams declared Gardiner to be \"a grand chap; one could not help but like him. He was undoubtedly the finest netminder in the league. What is more, he always played the game as a gentleman.\"\nLegacy.\nGardiner was the first goaltender who caught with his right hand to win the Vezina Trophy. He is the only NHL goaltender to captain his team to a Stanley Cup victory. In 1945, Gardiner became a charter member of the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 1998, he was ranked number 76 on \"The Hockey News\"' list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players. Gardiner is a member of Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame and Museum, and the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame.

        "title": "Volvo China Open",
        "text": "The Volvo China Open is a men's golf tournament that has been held annually in China since 1995. The event is organised by the China Golf Association and was co-sanctioned by the European Tour from 2004 until 2019. It has also featured as part of the Asian Tour, the OneAsia Tour, the China Tour and the Asia Golf Circuit.\nHistory.\nThe first event was played in 1995 as the China Open and featured on the Asia Golf Circuit. Raúl Fretes was the inaugural champion. The following year the event moved to the Asian Tour's schedule and continued to through 2008. The event joined the European Tour in 2004. Stephen Dodd won the first edition on the European Tour.\nChanges occurred in 2009 with the announcement of the OneAsia Tour, a new golf tour set up by the China Golf Association in partnership with the PGA Tour of Australasia, the Japan Golf Tour, the Korean PGA and the Korean Golf Association. Having been involved in the early stages, the Asian Tour withdrew from the OneAsia Tour. As a result, four events, the Volvo China Open, Pine Valley Beijing Open, Korea Open and Midea China Classic were removed from the schedule and subsequently became the founding events of the new tour. In addition, the Asian Tour stated that they would not allow their members to play in those events unless already qualified via membership of the European Tour, promising stiff penalties for those that ignored this ruling.\nIn 2011, Nicolas Colsaerts broke the tournament scoring record, shooting an aggregate of 264 (24 under par). He won by four shots.\nWu Ashun won the 2015 event by one shot over David Howell. He made history as he became the first Chinese player to win a European Tour event on home soil. Li Haotong won the event the following year, shooting a final-round 64 to win by three shots. He also became the second successive winner on home soil.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 and 2021 events were not sanctioned by the European Tour and proceeded as sole-sanctioned China Tour events. Zhang Jin won the 2021 event by making birdie at the final hole to beat Li Haotong by one shot. The 2022 event was scheduled to take place at the end of April on the European Tour but was postponed as restrictions due to the pandemic persisted in China, and ultimately not played. In 2023, it returned to the Asian Tour schedule as part of the International Series, and in 2024 will return to the European Tour.\nVenues.\nThe following venues have been used since the founding of the Volvo China Open in 1995."

        "text": "Linda Margaret Watson (born September 15, 1955) is a former field hockey player from Zimbabwe, who was a member of the national team that won the gold medal at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. Watson was also one of Zimbabwe's top hurdlers and sprinters.\nBecause of the boycott of the United States and other countries, only one team was available to compete in the Women's Field Hockey Tournament: the hosting USSR team. A late request was sent to the government of the African nation, which quickly assembled a team less than a week before the competition started. To everyone's surprise they won, claiming Zimbabwe's only medal in the 1980 Games."

        "text": "Clifford Trent Robinson (born March 13, 1960) is an American former professional basketball player.\nProfessional career.\nA University of Southern California alumnus, Robinson was drafted into the National Basketball Association by New Jersey Nets in 1979 with the 11th overall pick in the 1979 NBA draft. Cliff was the youngest player in the NBA two years running. He gave the Nets a solid rookie season, averaging 13.6 points and 7.2 rebounds per game. His 45 points against Detroit on March 9, 1980, are the most ever scored in an NBA game by a teenager.\nOn June 8, 1981, Robinson was traded to Kansas City for Otis Birdsong. Robinson would average a career best 20.2 points in 38 games for the Kings, before being traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers. In perhaps his best game as a Cavalier, on April 15, 1983, Robinson scored 40 points and grabbed 8 rebounds in a 132–124 victory over the Indiana Pacers.\nFrom 1979 to 1989, he steadily maintained his scoring average between roughly 18 and 20 points per game, despite playing for several teams. His best season (1985–86) came in a Washington Bullets uniform, as he achieved a career-high season total of 1,460 points in 78 games played, and shot a career-best 76.2% from the free throw line. On December 12, 1985, Robinson scored 21 points and hit a game-winning jump shot with only 1 second left in overtime to beat the Milwaukee Bucks by a margin of 110-108. That postseason, Robinson averaged 21.4 points, 8.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists, and 2 steals in a hard fought 3-2 series loss to the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round.\nIn 1986, he and Jeff Ruland were traded to the Philadelphia 76ers for NBA legend Moses Malone. Robinson left the NBA in 1989, but later signed with the Los Angeles Lakers for the 1991–92 NBA season. He finished his career averaging 17.2 points, 8.3 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game."
