        "title": "Miami RedHawks baseball",
        "text": "The Miami RedHawks baseball team (formerly the Miami Redskins) is the varsity intercollegiate baseball team of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, United States. The team is a member of the Mid-American Conference, which competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I. \nBeginning play in 1915, and Mid-American Conference (MAC) play in 1948, Miami has made the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship 7 times. The team has won 4 MAC conference championships, 3 MAC East Division titles (divisional play in the MAC was held from 1998-2017), and 3 MAC Tournament titles (the tournament began in 1981). The team plays its home games at McKie Field at Hayden Park in Oxford, Ohio.\nMiami Baseball Hall of Famer.\nWalter Alston lettered three years for Miami in both baseball and basketball. He played professionally for the St. Louis Cardinals organization, playing just one game at the major league level (two innings, one at bat) in 1936. After stints in the minors as both a player and manager, Alston returned to the big leagues with the Brooklyn Dodgers as manager in 1954, then moved with the team to Los Angeles in 1958, where he coached until retiring in 1976.\nAlston won seven National League pennants in his 23 year tenure as Dodgers manager. The franchise won four world championships as well -- in 1955 with Brooklyn and in 1959, 1963 and 1965 with Los Angeles. Named Manager of the Year three times, Alston also guided a victorious National League All-Star squad a record seven times. He retired after the 1976 season with 2,063 wins (2,040 in the regular season and 23 in the postseason) and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1983.\nAlston is a charter member of the Miami Athletics Hall of Fame, inducted in 1969. In 2001, indicative of the history of developing coaches at the university, Alston was inducted into the Miami Cradle of Coaches alongside Miami legends such as Ara Parseghian, Weeb Ewbank and Paul Brown.\nOther Notable Miamians.\n The first Miamian to play in the major leagues was Eddie Morgan of Lakewood, Ohio who played for two seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals (1936) and Brooklyn Dodgers (1937). Buddy Schultz, an All-American for Miami in 1972, played for 5 seasons with the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals (1975-1979), but is famous for striking out 26 batters in a single game (a 27th out was a bunt fielded by Schultz) for Miami against Wright State in 1971, a NCAA record.\nCharlie Liebrandt, First Team All-MAC in 1978, won 140 games in a stellar 14-year MLB career, including helping the Kansas City Royals to a World Series title in 1985. Steve Fireovid pitched for 6 seasons in the majors, but is perhaps best known as the subject of the book \"The 26th Man: One Minor League Pitcher's Pursuit of a Dream\", written with fellow Miami alumnus Mark Winegardner. In 1990, while pitching for the Montreal Expos’ Triple-A affiliate Indianapolis Indians, Fireovid composed a journal of his experiences. The journal was turned into a book, \"The 26th Man: One Minor League Pitcher's Pursuit of a Dream\" in 1991. The book was co-authored by Winegardner. \nBill Doran was a Miami All-American in 1979, would go on to 12-year professional career, and played for his hometown Cincinnati Reds during their 1990 World Series winning campaign. Tim Naehring was the Mid-American Conference Baseball Player of the Year in 1988 and would play for 8 years with the Boston Red Sox. Chris Sexton was an All-MAC player for three seasons (1991-1992) in Oxford, was honored as the second Miamian to win the MAC Player of the Year award and would play professionally for the Colorado Rockies (1995) and Cincinnati Reds (1997).\nAdam Eaton was a two-time All-MAC player for Miami, would play professionally in the majors for 10-years, including a 2019 World Series title with the Washington Nationals. Seth Varner was the 2014 MAC Pitcher of the Year, the only RedHawk pitcher to receive that honor. \nAnd Miami continues to serve as a launching pad for coaches. Tracy Smith played for Miami (1985-1988), coached the RedHawks (1997-2005), including the 2005 MAC regular season and MAC Tournament championship team, and has also led Arizona State, Indiana and the Michigan Wolverines. Smith was named the Big Ten and National Coach of the Year in 2014. Danny Hall was a 4-year letterman for Miami baseball (1974-1977), served as the head coach for Georgia Tech for over 30 years, and is a member of the Cradle of Coaches along with Smith.\nIn total, since the Major League Baseball Draft began in 1965, Miami has had over 74 players selected. Robert Bixler was the first Miamian ever drafted, in the 46th round by the Detroit Tigers in the inaugural draft, who would go unsigned. Over 26 RedHawk players have appeared in the major leagues, and 9 have been honored as All-American - Gary Cooper (1972), Buddy Schultz (1972), Dennis Smith (1973), Mark Naehring (1977), Bill Doran (1979), Jason Knoedler (2001), Michael Carlin (2002), Mike Ferris (2004), and John Slone (2004)."

        "text": "James Otis Rodgers (October 11, 1874 – May 17, 1945) was an American football player and coach. Rodgers played college football for Yale University from 1894 to 1897 and was captain of Yale's 1897 football team. He also served as the head coach of the 1899 Yale football team. He later had a lengthy career as an insurance broker.\nEarly years.\nRodgers was born in Toledo, Ohio in 1874. He was the son of James Scott Rodgers and Mary L. (Parker) Rodgers. His father was a manufacturer of boots and shoes in Toledo. Rodgers attended preparatory school at the Andover Academy where he competed for the school's football and track teams.\nYale.\nRodgers enrolled at Yale University where he played at the left tackle position for the Yale Bulldogs football team from 1894 to 1897. He was elected by his teammates as the captain of Yale's 1897 football team. During his four years as a player, the Yale football team compiled an overall record of 51–1–4, and has been recognized as national champions in three of the four years.\nRodgers also rowed for Yale's varsity crew in 1896 and competed with Yale's crew in England as part of the Henley regatta of 1896. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale in 1898 and was voted in his senior year as \"the man who has done the most for Yale.\"\nAfter graduating from Yale, Rodgers enrolled at Harvard Law School. Rodgers returned to Yale as the head football coach in the fall of 1899. Due to the demands of his legal studies, Rodgers was unable to spend all of his time with the football team and was assisted by Walter Camp. Rodgers coached the 1899 Yale football team to a 7–2–1 record, outscoring opponents 191 to 16. Rodgers also served as the crew coach at Yale, and also coached rowing at the New York Athletic Club.\nDuring the period from 1899 to 1912, Yale had 14 different head football coaches in 14 years – despite compiling a combined record of 127–11–10 in those years. During that 14-year span, the Yale football team has also been recognized as the national championship team by one or more of the major national championship selectors on seven occasions – 1900 (Billingsley, Helms, Houlgate, National Championship Foundation, Parke Davis), 1901 (Parke Davis), 1902 (Parke Davis), 1905 (Parke Davis, Whitney), 1906 (Billingsley, Parke Davis, Whitney), 1907 (Billingsley, Helms, Houlgate, National Championship Foundation, Parke Davis, Whitney), and 1909 (Billingsley, Helms, Houlgate, National Championship Foundation, Parke Davis).\nLater years.\nRodgers left Harvard Law School after two years to accept a position as vice president and general manager of the Lanyon Zinc Company of Iola, Kansas. He later became president of that company. Rodgers returned to New York in 1917 and spent the remainder of his career working as an insurance broker.\nRodgers was married to Cara Worthington Hale in April 1902 at Cleveland, Ohio. They had a son, James O. Rodgers, Jr. Rodgers died of a heart attack in May 1945 at the New Rochelle Hospital in New Rochelle, New York."

        "text": "Granger Errol Hall (born June 18, 1962) is an American retired professional basketball player. A standout college basketball player at Temple University, Hall also played in Spain's Liga ACB for 13 years, for a variety of clubs, and retired as that league's all-time leading rebounder (currently #2 overall).\nEarly life and education.\nHall grew up in Clayton, New Jersey and played for his hometown team at Clayton High School. \nCollege career.\nHall went on to play at Temple University for coach Don Casey in the East Coast Conference. After playing sparingly as a freshman, Hall broke out as a sophomore in 1981–82, averaging 14.9 points and 8.6 rebounds per game and sharing conference player of the year honors with American University's Mark Nickens.\nIn the offseason, Temple moved to the Atlantic 10 Conference and Casey was replaced by John Chaney. As a junior, Hall averaged 20.6 points and 7.4 rebounds in the first five games of the year. However, he injured his knee in a game against William &amp; Mary, had season-ending surgery, and took a medical redshirt.\nAfter a season of rehabilitation, Hall returned for the 1983–84 season and teamed with future NBA guard Terence Stansbury to lead the Owls to a 26–5 record and an undefeated Atlantic 10 season. Hall averaged 16.9 points and 7.1 rebounds per game during the season. With Stansbury departing, the primary scoring load fell to Hall in his senior season. He averaged 18.0 points and 8.5 rebounds per game. At the season's conclusion, he was named Atlantic 10 Player of the Year, giving Hall the unusual distinction of being named player of the year in two different NCAA Division I conferences; through 2018–19, the only other players to do this are Sedric Webber and Doug McDermott).\nIn addition to his two conference player of the year awards, Hall was a three-time honorable mention All-American, a three time first team All-Conference pick, and a three-time all Philadelphia Big 5 selection. He graduated as Temple's all-time leader in field goal percentage (since eclipsed) and free throw attempts. He was named to the Temple Athletic and Philadelphia Big 5 Halls of Fame.\nProfessional career.\nAfter graduation from Temple, Hall was selected in the fourth round (78th pick overall) of the 1985 NBA draft by the Phoenix Suns. After failing to make the team, Hall signed with Fórum Filatélico of Spain's Liga ACB. He played 13 thirteen years for Huesca La Magia, TDK Manresa, Caja San Fernando, CB Salamanca, and CB Ciudad de Huelva. In 1998, Hall retired with career averages of 18.6 points and 9.9 rebounds per game. He ended his career as the leading rebounder in league history (4,292, since broken) and is also in the top ten all-time in total points (8,039), blocked shots (348), and minutes played (15,395)."

        "text": "The 1974 London–Sahara–Munich World Cup Rally, known also under the commercial identity of 1974 UDT World Cup Rally, was the second and final of the World Cup Rallies to be held. Drawing inspiration from the 1974 FIFA World Cup which was held in Munich, the rally began in London, Great Britain and travelled to Munich, Germany, via Nigeria. It was won by the privateer Australian crew of Jim Reddiex, Ken Tubman and André Welinski, driving a Citroën DS.\n70 cars entered the race - 19 finished. The number of cars entering was lower than the 1970 London to Mexico World Cup Rally as the 1973 oil crisis and the resultant drop in global car sales had its effect on motorsport budgets. Many of the manufacturer teams of the 1970 event did not take part four years later. An error in the navigation notes of the event, caused by the end of a road in Algeria being extended several miles in between the compilation of the notes and the rally taking place saw the majority of competitors becoming lost in the Algerian Sahara Desert. This, in combination with the most gruelling terrain ever traversed by an international rally to that point saw only seven cars travel the full distance south into Nigeria, with only five then completing the full competition distance to Germany. Of the remainder of the \"Kano Seven\". the Lancia Fulvia of Shekhar Mehta and Lofty Drews suffered engine problems on the return leg from Kano to Tamanresset, was towed to Tunis and air-freighted to Salzburg to take part in the final part of the event. The V8 Jeep crewed by Americans Brian Chuchua, Douglas Fortin and Richard Clark made it through Africa, but crashed out of the event following a collision with a large dog in Turkey.\nThe majority of the competition did not complete the southernmost leg of the rally, south of the Tamanrasset rally point. Aerial searches for lost competing vehicles were conducted and eventually all cars were accounted for with no casualties. Some competitors abandoned the route and found their own way out of Africa. Notably former Grand Prix racer Stirling Moss and his co-drivers Mike Taylor and Allan Sell in their Mercedes-Benz arrived at an Algerian military fort with no water to find it abandoned. Moss and his crew-mates were unable to continue until the arrival of a water convoy in the following days.\nTime penalties quickly climbed into large figures during the stages held in Africa with the majority of the field finishing with over a week's worth of time penalties at the finish. The gap between the winning Citroën DS over the first of the factory supported Peugeots that finished second, third and fourth was over 28 hours. The 19th and last classified finisher acquired over 450 hours of time penalties, approximately 18 days behind the winners.\nRoute and scoring.\nThe course covered approximately through Europe and northern Africa before returning to Europe. Some of the principal towns and cities visited were, in order:\nThe course included many special stages, some over long. Time penalties were given for exceeding set times on the special stages, as well as for other infractions of the rules, and the cars' positions determined by the penalties awarded rather than lowest cumulative times.\nResults.\nOnly 19 cars finished the event, with only five cars completing the full rally distance. The route included a 171 km loop in the Hoggar mountains on the southbound transition of Algeria; of the \"Kano Seven\" only the winning Citroën and the Lancia Fulvia of Shekhar Mehta and Lofty Drews completed this part of the course. The Escort of Eric Jackson and Bob Bean also completed the loop, but although they started the leg to Kano, they turned back for Tamanrasset after incurring suspension damage in Niger."

        "title": "2011 Vancouver Stanley Cup riot",
        "text": "On the evening of June 15, 2011, in the downtown core of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, a riot broke out almost immediately after the conclusion of the Boston Bruins' win over the Vancouver Canucks in game seven of the Stanley Cup Finals, in which the Bruins won the Stanley Cup. \nNearly 150 people were injured during the incident, including four stabbings. On the night of the riot, nearly 100 arrests were made by the Vancouver police, including 85 for breach of peace, eight for public intoxication, and eight for criminal code offenses such as assault and theft. In 2015, four years after the riot, police finished their investigation and recommended the final charges against two suspects, bringing the total to 887 charges against 301 people. The riot did an estimated $4 million in damage, with an additional $5 million being spent on additional staffing costs for prosecuting the rioters.\nBefore the riot.\nPrevious riots.\nViolence has occasionally occurred in the wake of sporting events in North America and Europe, including multiple riots in Canada since the 1980s. Edmonton Oilers fans set fires and looted in the Whyte Avenue (\"Blue Mile\") area of Edmonton when the team qualified for the 2006 finals, Montreal was vandalized by Montreal Canadiens fans after the 1986 and 1993 titles and during the 2008 and 2010 playoffs, and Vancouver itself had riots following the Canucks' defeat in 1994.\nThe 1994 riot occurred after Game 7 of the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals, when the Canucks lost to the New York Rangers in an away game. A watch party hosted at the Canucks' then-home stadium, Pacific Coliseum, attracted over 8,300 people, while many more congregated downtown. After the Canucks lost 3–2, a crowd of between 40,000 and 70,000 people gathered downtown. Fighting and looting ensued, with police using tear gas to clear the area. The riot led to over 190 injuries, $1.1 million in damages, and charges being brought against over 100 people.\nIn response to these riots, investigations were examined by the Vancouver Police Department, the City of Vancouver, the Vancouver Fire Department, and other organizations. These reports found concerns including the lack of a sufficient traffic plan, issues with the communication equipment used by first responders, limited police visibility during the early stages of the gathering, lack of training in crowd control, and the availability of alcohol purchases from privately owned stores. A independent review of the 2011 riot found that the recommendations from 1994 were largely followed.\nIn Boston, there was no viewing party at TD Garden for the game. This was because of concern by the police that the additional people could lead to increased crime. Previous championships by the Boston Celtics, Boston Red Sox, and New England Patriots had led to wide-spread vandalism and three fatalities.\nFan zone.\nCity organizers had set up a two-block long fan zone on six-lane Georgia Street near the Rogers Arena. Two big screen TVs were set up for fans to watch the game. Temporary fences and gates were set up to provide checkpoints where police could control access to the area and check for alcohol (which police generally poured out when found). Following recommendations stemming from the 1994 riot, all liquor stores in the area were closed earlier in the day. Crowds had been generally well-behaved in the fan zone for the previous six games, with roughly 70,000 attending each event. Similar though smaller events had been very successful during the 2010 Winter Olympics. For the final game, an estimated 100,000 people crowded into the area, and people found ways to enter the zone without being checked for alcohol. Planned corridors to allow movement of emergency vehicles became impassable.\nGame.\nThe Vancouver Canucks and the Boston Bruins participated in the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, which was the culmination of the 2011 Stanley Cup playoffs. The series was played over seven matches, with the winner being the team that won four games. After the conclusion of the sixth game on June 13, 2011, the series was tied 3–3. The seventh game was played at the Canucks' home arena, Rogers Arena, as they had the better regular season record.\nThe game was played on Wednesday, June 15, 2011, and the puck dropped just after 5 pm PDT. Bruins goaltender Tim Thomas made 37 saves as Boston shut out Vancouver, 4–0, to win the Stanley Cup. Patrice Bergeron and Brad Marchand each scored two goals for Boston. Bergeron scored first at 14:37 in the first period, then had a shorthanded goal at 17:35 in the second. Marchand's first goal came at 12:13 of the second period; he then scored on an empty net late in the third. The Bruins outscored the Canucks 23-8 over the series. The win marked Boston's first championship since 1972. The series also marked both the Canucks' third appearance and loss in the Stanley Cup finals.\nRiot.\nTrouble at the watch party began before the game had started. One of the entrances to the fan zone was removed, as the barricades were being breached. At 5:55, a five-man fight occurred in the fan zone. Thirty-five young people climbed onto the roof of a Budget Rent a Car building. These individuals started throwing bottles after Marchand's second goal for the Bruins, at which point the police department decided to remove them.\nAround 7:18 pm, a fight with over 30 people took place. By 7:30, there was an increase in 911 calls about rioting, with disturbances including broken windows, 100 people on the roof of the Queen Elizabeth Theatre (which was showing Wicked to a 1,900-person crowd), and looting of a Gucci store.\nThe riot began to take shape as the game came to a close at 7:45 p.m., with some spectators throwing bottles and other objects at the large screens in the viewing area. Boston Bruins flags and Canucks jerseys were set afire, and soon some rioters overturned a GMC Pickup in front of the main post office. Some porta-potties collapsed after people stood on top of them. People began jumping on the car that had been overturned, and sometime before 8:00, the car was on fire.\nAt 8:26, the police began to play a pre-recorded message which alerted the rioters that they were partaking in an illegal activity, and ordered them to leave the area. The police began using smoke bombs at 8:48. The SkyTrain system began displaying messages on electronic screens reading: \"Due to the unstable situation in downtown Vancouver, we strongly advise customers NOT to travel downtown until further notice.\" Various stores began to be looted, including The Bay, London Drugs, Sears, and Sport Chek. At 10:30, the musical Wicked ended, and patrons were asked to stay inside the theater to avoid the riot. The riot ended around midnight, with the police using a helicopter to confirm that there were no outstanding areas of activity.\nBy the end of the night, around 100 arrests were made by the Vancouver police, including 85 for breach of peace, eight for public intoxication, and only eight for criminal code offenses such as assault and theft. Nearly 150 people were treated by hospitals for injuries sustained in the riot. By the next day, four people were still in serious condition. Dozens of people were treated for tear gas and pepper spray exposure. Vancouver General Hospital said they treated two major traumas, three stabbing victims, and one person with a head injury. St. Paul's Hospital treated more than 50 people for riot-related injuries. Of these, most had been exposed to tear gas and were released. Others had broken bones or cuts from broken glass. The hospital operated under \"Code Orange\", which was their mass casualty protocol. Their head doctor, Eric Grafstein, said that there were few injuries caused by police, especially compared to the 1994 riot, in which there were numerous baton strikes and dog bites. The BC Ambulance Service reported that they had transported a man who had jumped or fallen off of the Dunsmuir Viaduct, and that this man was in critical condition in the hospital.\nAftermath.\nResponse.\nIn the immediate aftermath, Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson initially attributed the situation to \"a small group of troublemakers\". Vancouver Police Department Chief Jim Chu said that instigators appeared to be some of the same individuals involved in a protest on the opening day of the 2010 Winter Olympics, and that they came equipped with eye protection, gasoline and other tools. He called them \"criminals and anarchists\" who disguised themselves as fans. The idea that anarchists were involved in the violence was rejected by UBC political science professor Glen Coulthard and others in a \"Vancouver Sun\" article on June 24. \"That this gets tagged as anarchist activity is just more of an assumption or bias that has been around for a long time,\" said Coulthard. \"[A]narchists are a convenient scapegoat for the police to deflect responsibility for what happened,\" said another commentator. One critic indicated that authorities had made several mistakes in the planning for the crowd—among them allowing parked cars near the screens and leaving newspaper boxes nearby which could be used as projectiles. On June 20, Chu said \"While we are still standing by that observation about the instigators, we are learning that most of the people that joined in the riot and that have now been charged represent a wider spectrum of young people, many of whom do not have criminal records.\" \nCanucks general manager Mike Gillis claimed that the people responsible for rioting weren't their fans, saying \"I think that would have happened whether we won or lost... When you're faced with thugs like that and people who are just prepared to punch other people in the face and think they're getting away with it, it's pretty hard to stop that. They're there for that purpose.\" Goaltender Roberto Luongo expressed a similar sentiment, stating that \"those were not the real Vancouver fans that were doing that... I think it was isolated groups. It was tough to watch that something like that happened to the city.\" Captain Henrik Sedin showed appreciation for the people who cleaned up the city afterwards: \"What happened with all the volunteers that came out, I think that shows more of what Vancouver is about than the night before.\"\nSinger Michael Bublé, who attended the game, launched an ad campaign which encouraged people to identify guilty parties and to make their photographic evidence public. \"They're trash, basically,\" he said, describing the rioters. \"It was gutless and disgusting behaviour. And I'm grateful for the police and firemen and paramedics who put their lives on the line, because there were people who were so scared. And that mob mentality could have killed somebody.\"\nAn Angus Reid poll soon after the riot showed that 90% of British Columbia residents were disgusted by the events of the riot. In the same poll, two-thirds of respondents indicated that they were satisfied with how the police handled the riot. Over half of the respondents answered that they didn't want to see a ban on street parties in response to the riot.\nCleanup.\nAfter the riot, an estimated 15,000 volunteers organized to clean up graffiti and other damage. Many volunteers organized via texting and social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, and the Vancouver Police Department endorsed the efforts to help clean up. Streets were reportedly clean by 10 am, with volunteers having shown up with brooms and dustpans to clean the city. Boarded up windows were covered in apologies and defences of the city's reputation. In response, the Hudson's Bay Company, a major retailer in the area, hosted a free pancake breakfast in thanks.\nCriminal prosecution.\nAs many as 70 officers from eight different police agencies formed the Integrated Riot Investigation Team, tasked with sifting through hundreds of hours of video and other evidence to identify rioters. Several participants in the riots turned themselves in to police after their faces were broadcast on TV, including the person responsible for setting the first car on fire. More than 1,000,000 photos and over 1,000 hours of video recorded by citizens were sent to the Vancouver Police Department as evidence.\nInsurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) offered their facial-recognition software to the police in an attempt to aid in their criminal investigation of the riot. In 2012, the Information and Privacy Commissioner of British Columbia, Elizabeth Denham, ruled that police could not use the software without a warrant requesting the information.\nBy July 2013, police had recommended 1,204 criminal charges against 352 suspected rioters. In July 2015, over four years after the riots, the last two suspects were charged. By then, a total of 887 criminal charges had been laid against 301 suspects, 274 of whom pled guilty. Police stated that they would continue to act on any tips they are provided and future charges could be laid.\nSocial media.\nSocial media played a role in broadcasting and documenting the riot. Soon after the start of the riot, the event trended on Twitter. Many people recorded images and videos of the damage as it unfolded. Experts have pushed back against the theory that social media was the cause of the riot. Christopher J. Schneider, a sociologist from the University of British Columbia said that the social media usage was \"crowd-sourced policing or lateral surveillance, where citizens were surveilling other citizens\".\nMany of the photos and videos taken of the riot were posted to social media sites such as Facebook and YouTube. This led to an unprecedented community effort to identify and report rioters. The Vancouver Police department received more than one million photos and tips from civilians, a load that one sergeant described as \"overwhelming\". The department issued a statement asking the public not to take justice into their own hands, saying that there was \"a growing danger that the tools of social media will be used to mete out vigilante justice\". Police encouraged those who were caught committing crimes on video to turn themselves in to avoid facing a public arrest. A study published in 2012 by Schneider and Daniel Trottier found that online vigilantes could increase police surveillance in the future, and raised concerns that doctored photos and videos could waste police resources as they try to filter out bad evidence. Additionally, the online effort to identify rioters sometimes identified minors, whose names cannot be made public in legal proceedings. \nRioters who were identified online often faced backlash, with participants being fired from their jobs, removed from athletic teams, and in some cases, receiving violent threats. Seventeen year-old rioter Nathan Kotylak and his family left their home after receiving threats. In a statement, his lawyer said that those who participated in online campaigns against rioters were \"becoming part of the mob mentality that swept through members of the crowd\" during the riot. Schneider concurred, saying that \"Many of the comments are horrific, threatening things that these people might not normally say... There is a profound disconnect between who we are online and in life. We are still learning how to be cyber citizens\". Another individual, Brock Anton, who posted on Facebook about the damage inflicted by the riot, was the target of harassment online for his alleged role in the riot. A Facebook page with the name \"Brock Anton Sucks Dick\" was created, and a song called \"The Ballad of Brock Anton\" received over 65,000 views on YouTube. However, Vancouver police later revealed that Anton wasn't involved in any criminal activities and declined to charge him. Camille Cacnio, a University of British Columbia student who stole two pairs of pants during the riot, expressed concerns that the online backlash had gone too far. She claimed that she had lost her job, lost friends, and that online posters had encouraged directing donations away from the Enspire Foundation, a charity that she was formerly involved in, due to her actions.\nFinancial losses.\nCBC News reported that the destruction caused by the rioters was worse than the 1994 riot, which cost around $1.1 million in damages. In 2016, B.C.'s crown prosecutors estimated that the riots cost $9 million, with damages costing around $4 million, and extra staffing costs for prosecution totaling around $5 million. Several large-scale stores such as London Drugs, The Bay, Sears Canada and Future Shop were among many that were looted.\nIn 2016, the ICBC won a lawsuit against 82 rioters, in which the defendants were found jointly liable for damages inflicted to automobiles during the riot. Of the defendants, 37 settled with the insurer, 35 received default judgements, and 10 went to trial. Nine of those ten were found liable. Sean Yates was the only defendant represented by a lawyer, and was found to be not liable due to insufficient evidence against him. This was despite a video of him throwing a mannequin through the window of a burning car, which the judge compared to \"kicking a dead horse\" as the car was already destroyed.\nIndependent review.\nAn independent review commissioned by the Province of British Columbia and the City of Vancouver released its 396-page report titled \"The Night the City Became a Stadium\" on August 31, 2011. This report labeled alcohol consumption as a primary cause of the riot. Additionally, the report concluded that the Vancouver Police Department's reinforcements arrived too late to control the crowd, although because the crowd had 155,000 people, it would be impossible for any sized police force to prevent the riot.\nThe department had 446 officers at the riot, which increased to 928 by the end of the evening. The report laid out 53 recommendations for preventing a similar occurrence in the future, including the development of a regional framework for cooperation between emergency services in the event of a riot, and for TransLink to better control alcohol around the transit system. Additionally, the report found that a core group of 1,000 rioters were primarily responsible for the riot.\nMedia coverage.\nThe riots sparked intense media coverage and attention on the local, national, and international level. Local media coverage of the riots began almost immediately after the game ended, with the local CBC, CTV and Global BC stations all running news coverage of the riots, with CTV and CBC doing so from studios located in downtown Vancouver itself. CBC News Network started running live coverage in conjunction with its nationally broadcast evening news show \"The National\", with one reporter calling in her reports from inside the riot.\nProminent publications such as \"The Atlantic\", \"The Guardian\", \"The New York Times\" and \"USA Today\" published editorials critical of the riots and its participants, as well as the city, noting the stark contrast between the Stanley Cup playoffs and the 2010 Winter Olympics. The \"Boston Herald\" provided coverage of the riots in addition to coverage of the Bruins' Stanley Cup celebrations, with other Boston media outlets providing their coverage of the riots.\nKissing couple photograph.\nDuring the riot, a photograph that depicted a young couple kissing while lying in the street during the riot, became an iconic image of the riots. This photograph, taken by Vancouver-based sports photographer Richard Lam, went viral on social media. \"Sports Illustrated\" called it \"the most compelling sports image of the year\". The photograph has been used worldwide in marketing campaigns, and is also used as the album cover of \"A Place for Us to Dream\", a 2016 compilation album by the English alternative rock band Placebo.\nAt first, many viewers suspected the scene had been staged. Lam pushed back on this suggestion: \"What you don't see in the frame is that twenty feet beyond is the mounted [police] squad, on horseback. I don't think they were in any mood for people to be playing around setting something up like this.\" The couple, who would be identified as Alexandra Thomas of Coquitlam, British Columbia, and Scott Jones of Perth, Western Australia, claimed that they were knocked down by the police's riot shields. Video evidence posted on YouTube later backed up their claims. In June 2016, it was reported that Thomas and Jones live in Perth, where they sleep under a poster copy of the photograph. As of 2021, the couple has remained together and are raising a family."

        "title": "Golf in China",
        "text": "Golf in China is a growing industry, with numerous golf courses being established, especially in the province of Hainan. In 2011, there were around 358,000 core players (aged over 18 and play more than 8 rounds a year) among the Chinese population, with a growth rate of 7.5%, and that figure was projected to grow to about 20 million by 2020. For the general public, golf is considered to be prohibitively expensive. However, it is seen as the top recreational sport for businesspeople and officials.\nThe sport attracts both foreign investment and overseas golfers, who come from such countries as South Korea, Australia, and Japan for the relatively inexpensive fees.\nChina holds such tournaments as the WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai, TCL Classic and Blue Bay LPGA on Hainan Island, the Volvo China Open and the BMW Asian Open.\nAmong the country's most successful golfers are Zhang Lianwei and Liang Wenchong.\nHistory.\nChuiwan, a stick and ball game with some similarities to golf, was played in China as early as 1000 AD, with evidence existing from the Song dynasty.&lt;ref name=\"http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/ASSH%20Bulletins/No%2014/ASSHBulletin14c.pdf\"&gt;\"Verification of the fact that Golf originated from Chuiwan\" , Ling Hongling, Professor of Physical Education,\nNorthwest Normal University, Lanzhou, P.R. China&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe sport was banned up until the middle of the 1980s by the Chinese Communist Party as being too bourgeois.\nThe first golf course constructed in China opened in 1984. It was the Chung Shan Hot Springs in Zhongshan, based on a design by Arnold Palmer.\nThe first international tournament held in China was the 1995 World Cup at Mission Hills in Guangdong province.\nChina's first regularly scheduled tournament was the 2004 BMW Asian Open. In 2005, the Volvo China Open was held in China, followed by the HSBC Champions in 2006.\nDespite a ban in 2004 that limits the number of golf courses in China due to environmental impact concerns, the number has more than tripled since 2004. At that time, only 170 courses existed. By 2009 there were almost 600. Around 2008, growth rate of the golf industry is 25 to 30 percent per year. In 2011, the rate was moderated by a much larger base, decreased to 7.5% (45 new courses). The number of courses rose further to 683 by January 2017, when the government ordered 111 of them closed due to water and land conservation concerns. At that time, all of China's province-level divisions except Tibet had at least one course in operation.\nAt the 2007 National People's Congress, acknowledging that the construction of new golf courses is not only a waste of public money, but also an illegal use of space, Premier Wen Jiabao said to the Congress that contracts in building new golf courses should be highly discouraged. The government currently imposes a 24 percent tax on golf clubs. In October 2015, the Chinese Communist Party banned all its members from joining golf clubs among other displays of extravagance as part of China's anti-corruption campaign. Several months later, the party clarified its position in an editorial in \"China Daily\", stating that party members were not to accept free memberships or rounds.\nCustomer costs.\nGreen fees and memberships in China are often expensive relative to developed nations. Average green fees for non-members are usually at least US$100, and often far more expensive. For example, at the Tomson Shanghai Pudong Golf Club, home to the BMW Asian Open on the European Tour, the initiation fee $170,000 with $1,800 a year dues. Condos sell for $22 million. The green fee for guest golfers is $125 plus caddie on weekdays, and $180 plus caddie on weekends. At that particular club, however, out of the 700 members, 300 are from overseas. At Shanghai's Sheshan International Golf Club where such tournaments as the HSBC Champions is played, the initiation fee is $230,000.\nClubs and courses.\nThere are currently about 500 golf courses in the country, the first of which was constructed in 1984. Mission Hills is one of the leading firms, owning courses around the country. Its Mission Hills Golf Club near Shenzhen has 12 courses, making it the world's largest golfing complex.\nPlayers.\nNumerous world-class players have emerged from China, including:\nBy province.\nHainan.\nHainan is exempt from the nationwide ban on the creation of new golf courses. In the province, the leader in course construction is Mission Hills, having created 10 courses.\nMission Hills Haikou golf complex.\nUnder construction since 2006, the Mission Hills Haikou is a multibillion-dollar project. This 80 km² complex (1.5 times the size of Manhattan), opened in 2011, will contain 22 golf courses and luxury hotels when fully built out. It will be one of the largest golf complexes in the world. The resort hosted of the World Cup in 2011."

        "title": "Cricket in Brazil",
        "text": "Cricket is a growing sport in Brazil, presently in nascent stages. Interest in the sport dates back earlier than 1860, which saw the establishment of the country's first official cricket ground, but it wasn't until 2003 that Brazil became a member of the International Cricket Council and emerged onto the world stage. Since then, cricket has become increasingly popular among native Brazilians, with the formation of a women's team and several junior competitions.\nHistory.\nCricket in Brazil began in the mid-1800s in Rio de Janeiro, during a period when a substantial portion of the city's population was British or of British descent. By the early 1860s, a number of cricket clubs were in operation, including the British CC, Artisan Amateurs CC, Rio British CC, Anglo-Brazilian CC and the British and American Club, although its playing facilities were limited to makeshift open spaces. Rio's Brazilian residents at the time had little or no interest in sport of any kind.\nBeginning in 1860, as part of a much-needed beautification programme for the city, Emperor Dom Pedro II created several new parks, including a large grassed area in front of his daughter Princess Isabel's house, on Rua Paysandu in the Laranjeiras district. Due to good relations between the British community and the Brazilian monarchy, this space eventually became the country's first proper cricket ground, and hosted cricket, tennis and bowls matches for many years. Princess Isabel and her father were frequent spectators, and often called upon to present trophies to the winners.\nIn 1872, George Cox formed the Rio Cricket Club, which soon began using the field as its home. In 1901, George's son Oscar organized football games on this same ground. In 1889, Brazil became a Republic and Princess Isabel was forced to move from her residence. The cricket ground was taken over by the new government, and although the sport was allowed to continue for a time, a permanent facility was now required. In 1897, the newly renamed Rio Cricket and Athletic Association purchased a large property in Niterói, on the other side of Guanabara Bay. A cricket ground was built and hosted its first match on 19 June 1898. Cricket would continue to be played on this ground for the next 97 years. As the local British population declined steadily through the 1970s and 1980s, however, cricket at the club faded away, and today the Rio Cricket ground is used exclusively for football.\nDuring those early days of cricket in Rio de Janeiro, the sport was also springing up at British sports clubs elsewhere in the country, including: the São Paulo Athletic Club in São Paulo (founded in 1888); the Santos Athletic Club in São Paulo (1889); Clube Internacional de Cricket and Club de Cricket Victoria, both in Salvador, Bahia (both founded in 1899); and the British Country Club in Recife, Pernambuco (1920). Teams and grounds were also created at the British-owned Morro Velho mine just outside Belo Horizonte in Minas Gerais (1887), and at the Frigorífico Anglo plant in Barretos, São Paulo (1913), where cricket was played until the mid-1990s. Cricket was also played at the Fazenda dos Ingleses in Caraguatatuba, on the coast of São Paulo, from 1927 until the Second World War.\nIt was in São Paulo, however, where the sport really took hold, and the São Paulo Athletic Club (SPAC) remains the country's centre of cricket to this day. In 1894, Charles Miller, the Brazilian-born son of British parents, returned from his studies in England with a football and some cricket equipment, which he immediately used to introduce these sports to the locals. In 1888, the São Paulo Athletic Club was formed, and Charles was a key member, organizing São Paulo's first football and cricket matches at the club's ground in the Consolação district. Football soon caught on, and Charles is known throughout the country as the father of Brazilian football. From 1928 to 1947 the club's cricket matches were held at a ground in Pirituba, before moving to the current site in Veleiros (Santo Amaro), which also houses a collection of Brazilian cricket memorabilia.\nRevival and Governing Body.\nIn 1922, the Brazil Cricket Association (BCA) was formed, with R.A. Brooking as its first President. The member clubs were Rio Cricket, the Pernambuco Athletic Club, Santos Athletic Club, São Paulo Athletic Club and the Paysandu Cricket Club. The BCA helped continue the series of matches that had been held between these clubs for many years, as well as interstate and international games. In fact, matches between São Paulo and Rio began in 1878 and continued regularly until 1995.\nAs cricket in Rio de Janeiro faded from the scene, it was left to São Paulo to carry the torch until 1989, when the Brasília Cricket (BCC) was formed, which today fields three men's teams and two women's teams. In 1999 in Curitiba, Paraná, British bank HSBC built a cricket ground at its staff sports facility, which is now home to three men's teams, while São Paulo has three men's teams as well.\nTo keep pace with this rejuvenation of cricket activity in Brazil, the national Associação Brasileira de Cricket (ABC) was founded in 2001, and Brazil became an Affiliate Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2003. The ABC's continuing goal is to grow the sport throughout the country, particularly among Brazilians themselves. Since joining the ICC, cricket in Brazil has grown steadily, thanks primarily to financial and technical support from the ICC.\nInternational competition.\nMatches between Brazil and Argentina began in 1888, while Rio Cricket began a series of matches with Club Atlético River Plate from Montevideo, Uruguay in 1902. The old Brazil Cricket Association continued to stage matches with Argentina for many years, with Charles Miller playing for the Brazil team until the 1920s. Brazil also hosted the New Zealand XI in the mid-1970s.\nWith the creation of the South American Championships (SAC) in 1995, Brazilian cricket entered its modern era. The national team has since participated in all eight SACs, hosting the event for the first time in April 2009 (SAC8). In other non-ICC international matches, Brazil has hosted the Chilean team twice (2000 and 2003), the Mexican team once (2009), and the MCC twice (1978 and 2007).\nIn 2006, Brazil qualified to join the ICC World Cricket League – a pathway to the ICC Cricket World Cup. Brazil competed in the inaugural ICC Americas Division 3 tournament in Suriname in 2006, as well as in Buenos Aires in 2008 and Santiago in 2009.\nBrazil won its first ICC tournament at the Americas Division 3 championship in Santiago, Chile in October 2009. As a result of winning this event, Brazil was promoted to Division 2 of the Americas WCL. Unfortunately its first participation in Division 2 in the Bahamas in February resulted in four straight losses and a return to Division 3.\nHistorically, the national team has consisted solely of expatriates, but this is changing. In recent years, the number of Brazilian cricketers representing their country has steadily increased. The winning Brazil squad in Santiago, for example, included six Brazilian-born players.\nDomestic competition.\nThe Brazil national league is made up of nine teams, which compete for the Commonwealth Ambassador's Trophy. The teams are as follows: Candangos, Brasília and Pakistan Plus from the state of Distrito Federal, the Sao Paulo Indians, SPAC and Sao Paulo from Sao Paulo state, while the state of Paraná is represented by Swadisht, Gralha Azul and Parana.\nSince 2000, Sao Paulo has won five league titles, while Brasília has won twice and Paraná once. Teams play 40-over-a-side matches from March to October. In November each year, a Twenty20 tournament between the three state representative sides is held. This tournament rotates from year to year between the three major cities.\nIn addition to this competition, Saquarembo CC is a Sao Paulo-based group of former Brazil players which plays just a few exhibition matches a year against Rest of the World (SP).\nDevelopment programme.\nWith Brazil's entry into the ICC came the creation of junior development programmes in Brasília, Sao Paulo and Curitiba.\nIn Brasília, a big breakthrough came when cricket was offered as an accredited PE course at the national University of Brasília. This led to the formation of the Candangos team, made up wholly of Brazilians. It also created interest amongst female students and resulted in the beginnings of women's cricket in Brasília. In terms of junior development, there is a growing number of boys participating in regular training sessions and games, giving the core of a future U17s team.\nIn Sao Paulo, progress is being made through a working relationship between St Paul's School and SPAC (the Sao Paulo Athletic Club). Enthusiastic people are in place to develop children's cricket further in Sao Paulo.\nIn Curitiba the focus has been on teaching children aged 8–12. The Associaçao Brasileira de Cricket employed a local junior development officer/coach for three years, and the success of the programme, which works with about 300 kids at four schools, was recognized by the ICC through the Volunteer of the Year Award presented to Norman Baldwin and to the programme itself for Best Junior Development Programme. This ongoing programme provided the platform for a very successful U13s tournament held in July 2009 in Curitiba, played between Argentina, the eventual winners, Chile and Brazil.\nIn addition to these three main centres of cricket, there are promising signs of life in the northern city of Fortaleza, and most recently, in Rio de Janeiro, the original home of Brazilian cricket. Development programmes are planned for these cities with a view towards increasing the number of teams in the domestic competition in the near future.\nTo help ensure the continuity and raise the level of the games, coaching, umpiring and scoring courses are being run throughout the year in all three cities, conducted by the coaches and umpires who have received ICC training. At present there are more than 20 level-one umpires.\nIn terms of facility development, Brazil is a little behind some of the other countries in the region. In Curitiba, the HSBC ground is very scenic and has a net, but is too small for ICC tournaments. In Brasília, there is still a need for a proper-sized, permanent ground, though the club does have two permanent nets at the Australian embassy. In Sao Paulo, where SAC8 was held, there have been a number of improvements at the full-size SPAC ground, including a new portable net.\nWomen's cricket.\nSince the success of the University of Brasília PE cricket course, women's cricket has grown steadily in Brasília. In 2007, there was a three-match series in Curitiba against an Argentina XI. Then in late January 2009, the Brazil team visited Buenos Aires for a return series. While Brazil was able to win only the one match, both series were closely contested.\nThe improvement in the women's team was noted in Buenos Aires and led to their invitation to play in the ICC Americas Women's Championship in Miami in May 2009. While unable to win any matches at this championship, the team was very competitive and earned the praise of all who witnessed how much they the players have achieved in such a short time.\nHowever, the Brazil Women's National Cricket team went on to win the South American Women's Cricket Championships in 2015 in Santiago, Chile for the first time in the history of Brazilian Women's cricket."

        "text": "The Tennessee Volunteers women's volleyball team represents the University of Tennessee located in Knoxville, Tennessee. The Volunteers (or \"Vols\") compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Volunteers play their home matches in the Thompson–Boling Arena on the university's campus, and are currently led by 3rd-year head coach Eve Rackham.\nAlong with all other UT women's sports teams, it used the nickname \"Lady Volunteers\" (or the short form \"Lady Vols\") until the 2015–16 school year, when the school dropped the \"Lady\" prefix from the nicknames of all women's teams except in basketball. In late 2017 the university reinstated the “Lady Volunteer” nickname for all women’s sports teams.\nProgram History.\nSince the Volunteers have begun competing in the NCAA they have begun a successful trend of winning and have recently built a very sound program that competes for conference championships regularly. The Vols have managed to make the NCAA Volleyball Tournament and AIAW Tournament a total of 23 times and reached the semi-finals in the tournament in 2005. The Lady Vols are generally considered the 3rd best program in the SEC historically, behind Kentucky and Florida, as they have the 3rd most appearances in the NCAA Tournaments, and are tied with LSU for 3rd most conference championships (9). \nRob Patrick Era.\nFrom 1997 until his retirement in 2017, Rob Patrick led the Lady Vols to 9 NCAA Tournaments, 2 SEC Championships, an SEC Tournament, and 11 20+ win seasons. One highlight of the Rob Patrick campaign came in 2004, when the Lady Vols set program records in wins (32), win percentage (.914), and claimed the SEC regular season and tournament championships. This success culminated in a #12 national seed and a NCAA Sweet 16 berth. The Lady Vols finished the 2004 season with a final record of 32-3 (15-1 SEC). The success rolled into 2005 as the Lady Vols made their deepest postseason appearance with their first and only NCAA Final Four appearance. Despite his accomplishments, the Lady Vols struggled during his final two years finishing a combined 29-29 and 12-24 in SEC play by the time Patrick retired in 2017.\nEve Rackham-Watt Era.\nOn January 10, 2018, former athletic director Phillip Fulmer announced Eve Rackham as the new head coach for the Lady Volunteers. In her first season as head coach, Rackham led the largest single season turnaround in program history, taking a team that finished 12-15 (5-13 SEC) the previous season to 26-6 (16-2 SEC) with a 2nd place SEC finish. Additionally, Rackham ended a 5 year postseason drought in 2018, and guided the Lady Vols to back-to-back NCAA tournaments for the first time since 2012 by qualifying in 2021 and 2022.\nYearly Record.\nThe University of Tennessee first fielded a women's varsity volleyball team in the fall of 1958 and first kept recordings of games in 1973. Since then, the Volunteers have won four Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships.\nAll-Americans.\nTennessee has 17 All-Americans including two AVCA All-America first team selections "

        "title": "South Africa national under-20 rugby union team",
        "text": "The South Africa national under-20 rugby union team (nicknamed the Junior Boks or the Baby Boks) are South Africa's junior team at national level. They have been competing in the World Rugby Under 20 Championship (formerly the IRB Junior World Championship) since its inception in 2008. This Under-20 tournament replaced the previously-held Under-19 and Under-21 Rugby World Championships. Prior to 2018, it had been the country's \"next senior\" (second-level) 15-man national side, but World Rugby no longer allows member unions to designate age-grade sides as \"next senior\" teams.\nHistory.\n2008.\nSouth Africa took part in the inaugural edition of the competition in 2008 held in Wales, where they were drawn in Pool B. They beat the United States 108–18 in their very first game. A 72–3 victory over Scotland and a 16–11 win against Samoa saw them top the pool to qualify for the semi-final stages. They lost their semi-final match 18–26 to England, but returned to winning ways with a 43–18 win over hosts Wales in the third-place play-off match.\nMatches\n2009.\nSouth Africa were placed in Pool C of the 2009 competition held in Japan. They emulated their 2008 form, winning all three of their pool matches – they beat Fiji 36–10, Italy 65–3 and France 43–27 to finish top of the pool. They again lost to England in the semi-finals (losing 21–40), but again bounced back by winning the third-place play-off match, this time beating Australia 32–5.\nMatches\n2010.\nA 40–14 victory over Tonga in the opening match of Pool C in the 2010 IRB Junior World Championship held in Argentina was followed up by a 73–0 victory over Scotland, before South Africa suffered their first ever pool stage defeat in the competition, losing 35–42 to Australia. Although finishing in second position in the pool, they still qualified for the semi-finals by virtue of having the best record of the second-placed teams across the three pools. They were eliminated 7–36 by New Zealand in the semi-finals, but managed to win the third-place play-off for the third year in a row, avenging their previous semi-final exists at the hands of England by beating them 27–22.\n2011.\nVictories in South Africa's first two matches at the 2011 IRB Junior World Championship held in Italy – beating Scotland 33–0 and Ireland 42–26 – were followed by a defeat at the hands of England, losing 20–26 to finish second in the pool and failing to qualify for the semi-finals for the first time. Instead, they went into the fifth-placed play-off series, where a 57–15 win over pool rivals Ireland and a 104–17 win over Fiji saw them finish the competition in fifth spot.\n2012.\nSouth Africa hosted the tournament in 2012, but the hosts got off to a bad start, losing 19–23 to Ireland in their first match. However, they recovered to beat Italy 52–3 and previously-unbeaten England 28–15 to finish top of the log. They easily dispatched Argentina in the semi-final, winning 35–3, before beating New Zealand 22–16 in the final in Cape Town, winning the competition for the first time and ending the latter's four-year reign as champions.\n2013.\nSouth Africa won all three their pool matches at the 2013 IRB Junior World Championship held in France; they beat the United States 97–0, England 31–24 and hosts France 26–19 to top their pool to qualify to the semi-finals. They lost their semi-final match 17–18 to Wales before winning their fourth third-place play-off match in six seasons, beating New Zealand 41–34.\n2014.\nIn the 2014 IRB Junior World Championship held in New Zealand, South Africa beat Scotland 61–5, hosts New Zealand 33–24 and Samoa 21–8 to finish top of their pool. They again met New Zealand in the semi-finals and beat them again, this time by a 32–25 scoreline, to qualify to their second final. However, they lost the final 20–21 to England to finish the competition in second spot.\n2015.\nFor 2015, the IRB Junior World Championship was rebranded as the World Rugby Under 20 Championship. South Africa started the competition with a 33–5 win against hosts Italy and recorded a 40–8 win against Samoa and a 46–13 win over Australia in their remaining pool matches to finish top of Pool B to qualify for the semi-finals with the best record pool stage of all the teams in the competition. They came up against an England side that beat them in the 2014 final and were eliminated by the same opponents again, losing 20–28 to be eliminated from the competition. They restored some pride by winning their third-place play-off match against France 31–18 to win the bronze medal.\n2016.\nSouth Africa came from behind to beat Japan 59–19 in their opening match in Pool C of the 2016 World Rugby Under 20 Championship held in Manchester. They were beaten 13–19 by Argentina in their second match, suffering only their fourth defeat ever in the pool stage of the competition, but bounced back to secure a 40-31 bonus-point victory over France in their final pool match to secure a semi-final place as the best runner-up in the competition. They faced hosts and three-time champions England in the semi-finals, who proved too strong for the visitors, knocking them out of the competition with a 39–17 victory. South Africa's final match came against Argentina, who already beat them previously in Pool C, in the third-place play-off final. Argentina won again, with a very convincing 49–19 scoreline, condemning South Africa to fourth place in the competition.\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nThe following players were named in the South Africa Under-20 squad for the 2019 World Rugby Under 20 Championship:\nPrevious squads.\nThe following players played at previous editions of the World Rugby Under 20 Championship:\n(c) denotes team captain.\nAward winners.\nThe following South Africa U20s players have been recognised at the World Rugby Awards since 2008:"

        "title": "Canadian Rugby Championship",
        "text": "The Canadian Rugby Championship (CRC) () was a Canadian amateur rugby union competition, partially funded by the World Rugby. It was the highest level of men's domestic rugby in Canada. Four representative teams from regions across Canada competed for the MacTier Cup. The CRC was started in 2009 by Rugby Canada and was held annually from August to September. Rugby Canada also held CRC tournaments for under-19 men, under-20 women, and senior women.\nHistory.\nThe North America 4.\nIn 2006, the IRB started the North America 4 (NA4), to help create a higher level of rugby in North America, as well as to develop players and provide a pathway to national team selection and to make North American rugby teams more competitive at international level. It was contested by four teams, two each from Canada and the USA.\nThe American Rugby Championship.\nOn September 7, 2009 the IRB scrapped the NA4 and unveiled the ARC competition, in which Canada, the USA and Argentina would send representative teams to play for a championship title (Tonga was later added in the second season, replaced with Uruguay from 2012 onwards)\nIn order to select a team that would play in the ARC, Rugby Canada unveiled the CRC, with the champion and runner-up advancing to the ARC. The BC Bears Coached by Mike James and Kris de Scossa were inaugural champions, who went on to play Argentina Jaguars, Russia and England Counties. Following the first season, a Canada Selects team was chosen by Team Canada coach Kieran Crowley instead, exclusively from players who competed in the CRC.\nThe CRC.\nIn the inaugural 2009 season, six games were played in a round-robin format, similar to that of The Rugby Championship, with the team collecting the most points over the season being named champions.\nThe following season, the same six game season was used, however a post-season was added—with the top two teams squaring off in a final at the home venue of the team which amassed the most points during the regular season.\nIn 2011 the format changed yet again, scrapping the final and instead going back to a round-robin competition. This time with ten games, each team playing five. The western teams (the BC Bears and the Prairie Wolf Pack) played three home games and two away games, while this schedule was reversed for the two eastern teams, (the Ontario Blues and the Atlantic Rock). In 2012, this was switched, having the western teams play two home games and three away games, with the eastern teams playing the opposite.\nSeason structure.\nThe CRC is broken up into a pre-season and a round robin season, with no postseason. During the pre-season teams play exhibition matches against other teams, usually not participating in the CRC. The pre-season is not a formal one set by the league, but instead the individual teams can play club or touring sides at their own leisure, or may choose to not play any pre-season games at all.\nStarting in mid August, and ending late September, the regular season follows the same format as The Rugby Championship, having teams playing in a round robin format, with the team that accumulates the most points throughout the tournament winning the MacTier Cup. Therefore, no post-season is required. Every team plays five games, the western teams playing three at home and two away, while the eastern teams play a reversed schedule. There are no divisions or conferences.\nThe points system for the season is the same as most rugby competitions around the world:\nAwards.\nThe Player of the Year award is awarded at the end of the season to recognize the best player that year. The award is decided by votes from all the coaches, as well as a Rugby Canada representative.\nBroadcasting.\nThe league had no deals with any networks; however, some teams provide live online streaming of their games. CBC Television aired the 2010 final live, but this was the only match shown on national television.\nChampions.\nThe MacTier Cup was created in 1998 and awarded to the champion of the Rugby Canada Super League. Since the Super League folded, the MacTier Cup is now awarded to the Canadian Rugby Championship champion."

        "title": "Old Dominion Monarchs baseball",
        "text": "The Old Dominion Monarchs baseball team is a varsity intercollegiate athletic team of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, United States. The team is a member of the Sun Belt Conference, which is part of NCAA Division I. Old Dominion's first baseball team was fielded in 1931 as the William and Mary College – Norfolk Division Braves. ODU joined Division I in 1977. The team plays its home games at Bud Metheny Baseball Complex in Norfolk, Virginia, where it has played since 1982. ODU has won six conference tournament titles and have been to the NCAA tournament nine times. The Monarchs are coached by Chris Finwood, a native of Hampton, Virginia, who is in his eleventh year at the helm. The Monarchs have had eleven players reach the Major Leagues and two, Justin Verlander and Daniel Hudson, have played in the World Series.\nHistory.\nDivision II: pre-Metheny era.\nOld Dominion University was founded in 1930 as the College of William and Mary Norfolk Division. The then named Braves played their first season of baseball in 1931 under head coach Tommy Scott. Scott coached the Braves for nine seasons before retiring in 1939 after compiling an overall record of 50-62-2. After Scott the Braves were coached by several coaches who mostly only coached for one season, the most successful of which coached for three seasons and won a total of 5 games.\nBud Metheny era.\nIn 1948 former New York Yankee outfielder Arthur \"Bud\" Metheny became the head coach of the Braves. In 1962 the school became Old Dominion College before attaining university status in 1969 when they changed the name to the Monarchs. Their first post season appearance and title came in 1963 in the Mason Dixon conference playoffs where they defeated Loyola two games to one. While playing in the NCAA's Division II Old Dominion won 6 titles; two Tidewater Scholastic championships in 1932 &amp; 1934, four Little Eight championships in 1958 &amp; 1961-63, and four Mason-Dixon Conference championships in 1963, 1964, 1965, and 1968. In 1963 &amp; 1964 the Monarchs won the NCAA College Division Eastern Championship before losing in the championship in 1965. During the 1969–1970 season the Monarchs were coached by Jim Bradly and went on to a 12-14 record, after which Metheny returned to the team for the next 10 years. In 1971 &amp; 1972 ODU finished as NCAA Division II South Atlantic finalists. He also led the transition for the Baseball Monarchs to NCAA Division I in 1977. Metheny left coaching the Monarchs in 1980 after winning his last title, the Virginia Intercollegiate State Championship over UVA. Metheny is ODU's all-time career wins leader with 423 wins in 31 years.\nMark Newman era.\nMark Newman took over after Metheny in 1981 when the team left the Mason Dixon Conference for the ECAC South, which would later become the Colonial Athletic Association in 1985. In Newman's second season the Monarchs earned a bid to the 1982 NCAA tournament where they won their first game against the ECAC South champion ECU Pirates. In 1983 the Monarchs left the ECAC for the Sun Belt Conference. During the 1985 season the Monarchs set several school recording including overall wins with a record of 50-11, the schools only 50 win season, and a Sun Belt Championship. The 1985 Monarchs earned a berth in the 1985 NCAA tournament and during the season achieved their highest ranking in school history, appearing at 7th in the polls. Newman coached the Monarchs from 1981–1989 when he left to become New York Yankees coordinator of minor league instruction.\nThe CAA years.\nIn 1990 the Monarchs were taken over by Pat McMahon who in his first year led the team to the 1990 NCAA tournament. The Monarchs then transitioned to the Colonial Athletic Association in 1992. McMahon again led the Monarchs to the NCAA tournament in 1994 after winning the CAA tournament. Both times McMahon led the Monarchs to the NCAA tournament he had 40 win seasons. McMahon left ODU after the 1994 season to become the associate head coach at Mississippi State. Tony Guzzo was hired from VCU in 1995 after McMahon left ODU and led the Monarchs to back-to-back CAA titles and NCAA tournaments in his first two seasons at the helm. Between Coach McMahon and Coach Guzzo the Monarchs had the 21st best winning percentage (.660) in the NCAA during the 1990s tied with Texas and ahead of teams like USC and Mississippi State. In 2000 Guzzo again led his team to the post season earning an at-large bid to the 2000 NCAA tournament. Guzzo coached the Monarchs until 2005 when Jerry Meyers took over. Meyers coached the Monarchs from 2005–2010 when he returned to South Carolina. Meyers' career at ODU was highlighted by a victory over #2 UNC, the school's lone victory over a top 5 team until 2014. The 2011 ODU Monarchs were coached by interim head coach Nate Goulet who was named CAA Coach of the Year and led the team to an appearance in the CAA Championship game.\nChris Finwood era.\nIn 2012 Old Dominion hired Chris Finwood as their head coach. Finwood came to ODU from Western Kentucky where he led the Hilltoppers to two conference titles and NCAA tournament appearances. His first season resulted in 19 wins and last place in the CAA. Finwood led the Monarchs from the CAA to Conference USA in 2014 and made them instantly competitive in their new league. The 2013 team was ineligible for the CAA tournament because of this planned move and went on to win 30 games and finished in 3rd place in the conference. Finwood's third team at ODU continued to improve on the previous year by winning six more games than the 2013 team. On April 29, 2014 the Monarchs defeated the #1 ranked team and eventual College World Series runner-up Virginia by a score of 8-1 at Harbor Park in Norfolk, Virginia. The victory was ODU and Finwood's first ever victory over the #1 team in the country. The season concluded after a deep run in the conference tournament earned them a bid to the 2014 NCAA tournament where they went 0-2. In just three years Finwood led the Monarchs from last place in the CAA to back-to-back 30-win seasons, and earned an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as a three seed in the Columbia, South Carolina Regional. In 6 seasons he has won 30+ games at the helm of ODU's program.\nIn 2015 ODU swept nationally ranked UVA making it three straight over the Cavaliers, two of those wins when UVA was ranked #1. Finwood has currently led his team to 27+ wins in three of his four seasons at ODU after a 19 win campaign in his first season and two straight C-USA Conference Tournament berths. Despite a 30 win season and 15-12 in conference, ODU was ineligible for 2013 CAA Conference Tournament but would have been the third seed.\nCoaching records.\nPre-Division I\nDivision I\nYear by year results.\nNote: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, CW = Conference Wins, CL = Conference Losses\nMonarchs in the NCAA tournament.\nNCAA tournament Game-by-Game Results\nNCAA All Tournament Team\nRivalries.\nRecords through of 2015 season\nEast Carolina University\nODU and ECU were longtime opponents in the CAA before ECU's move to the C-USA. When ODU announced it was moving to the C-USA in 2014 it was expected to add to the already heated rivalry but they were only together in the C-USA for one year due to ECU's move to the American Athletic Conference. ECU and ODU are yearly opponents regardless of conference affiliation and ECU leads the all-time series 44-34.\nUniversity of Virginia\nODU and UVA have played very competitively over the course of their history. With the hiring of head coach Brian O'Connor and the resurgence of Cavalier baseball during his tenure the Cavaliers have won most of the games in the past decade. UVA and ODU have scheduled home-and-home series at Davenport Field in Charlottesville and Harbor Park in Norfolk. ODU upset then #1 UVA at Harbor Park in 2014 and #1 UVA in Charlottesville in 2015 for the programs only wins over a top ranked team in school history. ODU leads the all-time series 33-24-2 and is currently on a three-game winning streak.\nVirginia Commonwealth University\nVCU was one of Old Dominion's largest rivalries from its time in the CAA. ODU &amp; VCU games are among the highest attended games on their schedule and they play at least one game against each other every season. Former Monarch Paul Keyes was the head coach at VCU from 1995 until his death in 2012. In honor of Coach Keyes the two teams began a charity game in his name where they raise money for cancer research during a game played at War Memorial Stadium in Hampton, Virginia. The Paul A Keyes Hitting Facility at the Bud Metheny Baseball Complex which opened in Fall 2014 was also named in Coach Keyes' honor. ODU leads the all-time series 87-61.\nODU vs Top 10 Teams.\nOld Dominion is 7-5 all-time in match-ups against Top 10 ranked teams.\nAward winners.\nConference awards.\nConference Player of the Year\nConference Tournament MVP\nConference Freshman of the Year\nConference Newcomer of the Year\nConference Defensive Player of the Year\nConference Coach of the Year\nNational honors.\nOld Dominion has had six players selected as D-I First Team All-Americans and two selected as D-II First Team All-Americans with one selected twice. Twelve Monarchs have been named First Team Freshman All-Americans. Forty-nine Monarch players have been named to the ABCA All-Region Team.\nAll Americans\nFreshman All Americans\nC – Coaches, CB – Collegiate Baseball/Louisville Slugger, BA – Baseball America, BW – Baseball Writers, SN – Sporting News, PG - Perfect Game/Rawlings, D1 - D1Baseball\nABCA All Region\nRegional Coach of the Year\nNotable players.\nMajor Leaguers\nOn Team USA\nOld Dominion has produced five first round draft picks in the MLB Draft with the highest selection being Justin Verlander at number 2 overall by Detroit in 2004. ODU baseball players have been selected 82 times in the MLB Draft.\nRetired numbers.\nThe ODU Baseball Monarchs have retired two jerseys in their history. The jersey number 3 was retired former New York Yankee outfielder and ODU Baseball Head Coach Bud Metheny who compiled an overall record of 423–363–6 during his 31 years at ODU and was induced into the American Association of College Baseball Coaches Hall of Fame in 1984 and the ODU Hall of Fame in 1982. While playing for the Yankees Metheny won the 1943 World Series. Coach Metheny was named the East Region National Coach of the Year in 1963 and the Bud Metheny Baseball Complex where ODU currently plays was named for him.\nThe second jersey is number 35 for current Houston Astros pitcher Justin Verlander. Verlander was the second overall pick in the 2004 MLB draft. He was induced into the ODU Hall of Fame in 2012 and holds the ODU, Virginia, and Colonial Athletic Association all-time record for career strikeouts and earning Freshman All-American honors. As of 2014 Justin Verlander is the only former Monarch to have played in the World Series pitching in two for Detroit in 2006 and 2012. In 2006 as a rookie Verlander pitched in games 1 and 5 against the Cardinals going 0–2. In the 2012 series Verlander pitched game 1 taking the loss as the Giants swept the Tigers in four games for the championship. Verlander won the AL Rookie of the Year in 2006 when he went to his first World Series and has also won the 2011 AL MVP and Cy Young Award. He has also pitched two no hitters in his career, once on June 12, 2007 against Milwaukee and again on May 7, 2011 against Toronto.\nBud Metheny Baseball Complex.\nThe Monarchs have played at the Bud Metheny Baseball Complex since it opened in 1983. The complex has a total capacity of 2,500 people with the stadium record being 2,125 on the day of its dedication. The facilities contain coaches offices beneath the first base bleachers and the player locker room beneath the third base bleachers. In 2009 the field obtained a new video board and in 2011 a batter's eye was erected. The facility also has a beer garden in the first baseline foul area, an all turf halo behind home plate, a turf stretching/bunting area, and the Paul Keyes Indoor Hitting Facility."

Lyon had only made four first-class appearances and was previously one of the groundstaff at the Adelaide Oval.\nDuring the test series, a five-year old kid going by the name Sharujan Shanmuganathan caught the attention of viewers when his free-flowing, elegant cover drive became a talking point as it was captured by one of the cameramen during the course of the test match. Sharujan was only five-years-old when he received recognition for playing cover drives, and commentator Tony Greig, who was named as one of the commentators for the test match, reportedly spotted him playing at the grass bank of the Singhalese Sports Club Cricket Ground.

        "text": "The 2012 Giro d'Italia was the 95th edition of Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It started in the Danish city of Herning, and ended in Milan. The complete route of the 2012 Giro d'Italia was announced in mid October. For the first time since the 2007 edition no climbing time trial was included in the route. The colour of the jersey for the mountains classification was changed for this year's edition from green to blue. The move came at the behest of sponsor Banca Mediolanum, who renewed its support of the mountains classification for a further four years.\nThe race was won by Canada's Ryder Hesjedal of , becoming the first Canadian rider to win a Grand Tour event and the second non-European rider to win the Giro (the first being Andrew Hampsten in 1988); he also became only the second rider to take the leader's jersey from another rider on the final day, after Francesco Moser did so in 1984. Hesjedal won the general classification by 16 seconds over runner-up Joaquim Rodríguez of Spain, representing – the closest race-winning margin since Eddy Merckx beat Gianbattista Baronchelli by 12 seconds in the 1974 edition – who also won two stages and the points classification title, edging out sprinter Mark Cavendish by one point. Third place was taken by 's Thomas De Gendt of Belgium, after he put in strong performances on the final two stages of the race; he won the race's queen stage, finishing at the high-point of the itinerary, at the Stelvio Pass and also finished in the top five of the time trial. As such, he gained sufficient time to move up from ninth to third over those stages, becoming the first Belgian rider to take a Grand Tour podium since Johan Bruyneel finished third at the 1995 Vuelta a España.\nIn the race's other classifications, rider Rigoberto Urán of Colombia finished as the best rider aged 25 or under in the general classification, finishing in seventh place overall; the mountains competition was won by Italy's Matteo Rabottini of the team, scoring almost double the number of points that his nearest rival in the standings accrued. Rabottini was the only Italian to feature on the podium, as for the first time since 1995, no Italian riders finished in the top three overall, as 's Michele Scarponi – the defending champion – could only finish fourth overall.\nTeams.\nAll 18 UCI ProTeams were automatically invited and were obliged to attend. In addition four UCI Professional Continental were announced in January 2012. The full list of participating teams is:\nPre-race favourites.\n2011 winner Alberto Contador was banned for two years on 6 February for doping during 2010 Tour de France and therefore did not start in the Giro. Ivan Basso, winner of the Giro of 2006 and 2010, announced on 13 November 2011 that he was aiming for a third pink jersey.\nJohan Bruyneel, manager of the new fusion team between Leopard-Trek and Team Radioshack, stated that it would be hard for three-time runner-up Andy Schleck and his brother Fränk Schleck to win the 2012 Tour de France because of the large number of kilometers against the clock. There was a chance that one of the brothers would target the Giro d'Italia instead. On 19 November 2011 Fränk initially announced that the Schleck brothers would not ride the Giro and will focus on the Tour despite the time trialing kilometers. Eventually on 29 April 2012 it was announced that Fränk Schleck would replace the injured Jakob Fuglsang as the team leader during the race.\nOn 17 April Michele Scarponi, winner of the 2011 edition after Contador's suspension, announced that he wanted to win the Giro on the road and not after a suspension of another rider. Scarponi teamed-up with Lampre–ISD teammate and 2004 Giro d'Italia winner Damiano Cunego. Cunego aimed for a high finish in the Giro and skipped the 2012 Tour de France due to the large amount of time trialing kilometers.\nOther riders named as overall contenders were Ag2r–La Mondiale's John Gadret (third overall in the 2011 Giro d'Italia), 2011 Youth classification winner Roman Kreuziger of team Astana, Team Katusha's Joaquim Rodríguez (fourth overall in the 2011 Giro d'Italia) and the Venezuelan climber José Rujano of the Androni Giocattoli team.\nRoute and stages.\nThe first three stages were announced on 5 October 2011, with the remaining stages announced on 16 October. On 18 April 2012 it was announced that the route for Stage 12 Seravezza to Sestri Levante had been altered because the coastal road through the Cinque Terre remains unusable following the severe landslides which struck the area on 25 October 2011. The new route is long.\nThe stages were divided into five categories of difficulty; category A, B for flat stages (from A for \"stages presenting no particular difficulty\"), category C for medium mountain stage, category D for mountain stages and category E for time trial stages. These categories were used to determine the time limit on the stage.\nClassification leadership.\nIn the 2012 Giro d'Italia, four different jerseys were awarded. For the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages, the leader received a pink jersey. This classification was considered the most important of the Giro d'Italia, and the winner was considered the winner of the Giro.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a red jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage. Unlike in the better known points classification in the Tour de France, the type of stage had no effect on what points were on offer – each stage had the same points available on the same scale. The win earned 25 points, second place earned 20 points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point fewer per place down to a single point for 15th. In addition, points could be won in intermediate sprints.\nThere was also a mountains classification, the leadership of which was marked by a blue jersey. The jersey had been green since the jersey was first awarded, but with a sponsorship change, the jersey color was changed to blue. In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching the top of a climb before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized as either first, second, third, or fourth-category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded still more points than the other first-category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\" for the 2012 Giro d'Italia was the Stelvio Pass. The first rider to cross the Stelvio was Thomas De Gendt.\nThe fourth jersey represented the young rider classification, marked by a white jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1987 were eligible.\nThere were also two classifications for teams. In the Trofeo Fast Team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time; the Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification, with the top 20 placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run."

        "text": "The 1978 World Rowing Championships were World Rowing Championships that were held from 30 October to 5 November at Lake Karapiro near Cambridge, New Zealand. Twenty-eight countries were represented at the regatta. In the history of the World Rowing Championships, 1978 was the only year when the lightweight rowing championships were not held in conjunction with the open men and women event; the lightweight events had already been held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in August.\nBackground.\nLake Karapiro was formed in 1947 through a hydroelectric project on the Waikato River. It was soon recognised as the best rowing venue in New Zealand, and was used for the 1950 British Empire Games. World rowing championships had been held since 1962 by FISA, the World Rowing Federation, and in 1974 New Zealand was provisionally awarded the 1978 world event. Don Rowlands, who had won rowing medals at British Empire and Commonwealth Games in the 1950s and would later become chairman of the 1978 World Rowing Championships organising committee, had lobbied for the event to come to New Zealand; prior to 1978, the event had always been held in the Northern Hemisphere. He found a supporter in Thomas Keller, the president of FISA. There was also some curiosity amongst the rowing fraternity how a small island nation from the South Pacific managed to win gold medals at the 1968 and 1972 Summer Olympics, in men's coxed four and men's eight, respectively. But it was not until the 1976 Summer Olympics that 1978 event was confirmed, which left only two years to organise the event.\nThe entire event was organised by volunteers; the organising committee had no people in employment. Cyril Hilliard was the secretary of the organising committee. Volunteer labour erected a grandstand; all built with scaffolding. As Rowlands was a marine engineer, he designed the starting pontoon himself and the construction was carried out by James Hill, a former Olympic rower who was a joiner by trade. Hill also built the start and finish towers. A company donated 13 kit houses, and these were used as offices. Catering for the competitors was done by the New Zealand Army. It is estimated that in total, close to 100,000 spectators attended the four days of racing. Keller called it afterwards \"the greatest regatta in living memory\". Former British rower Dickie Burnell, who worked at Karapiro as a correspondent for \"The Times\", labelled the event \"the greatest show on water\".\nTwenty-eight countries were represented by their rowers in 140 boats, and this was the largest international sports competition that the country had organised up to that time. The event made a profit of NZ$155,000, which was used to fund a rowing foundation.\nMedal summary.\nMedallists at the 1978 World Rowing Championships were:\nMen's events.\nIn the single sculls and coxless pair boat classes, the first three boats from each heat qualified for the semi-final, and three further semi-finalists were determined via a repechage. In all other boat classes, the first from each heat qualified for the final, with the other finalists determined via a repechage.\nMen's lightweight events.\nIn the history of the World Rowing Championships, 1978 was the only year when the lightweight rowing championships were not held in conjunction with the open men and women event. The 1978 FISA Lightweight Championships were held in Copenhagen, Denmark, during August.\nWomen's events.\nThere were six boats nominated in the coxless pair and they went to the final without heats. In all other boat classes, the winner of each heat qualified for the final and all other finalists were determined via a repechage.\nEvent codes.\nNew Zealand officials had expected their men to win three or four medals, and Rowlands stated that he expected the men's eight to win gold. In the end, the bronze won by New Zealand's eight was the host's only medal. This table does not include the lightweight events.\nMedal table.\nThe medal table excludes the lightweight events.\nFinals.\nThe Soviet Union were disqualified in the final of the women's coxed four.\nGreat Britain.\nSix men's teams and only one women's team from Great Britain competed at the championships."

        "text": "The 1995 Scottish Challenge Cup final was an association football match between Stenhousemuir and Dundee United on 5 November 1995 at McDiarmid Park in Perth. It was the sixth final of the Scottish Challenge Cup since it was first organised in 1990 to celebrate the centenary of the Scottish Football League.\nThe match was Stenhousemuir's first national cup final in its 111-year history; whilst it was Dundee United's first since winning the Scottish Cup only a year beforehand in 1994. The tournament was contested by clubs below the Scottish Premier Division; Dundee United from the First Division and Stenhousemuir the first club to reach the final from the Second Division.\nAfter 90 minutes of normal time and 30 minutes of extra time the score was 0–0 so the winner was decided by a penalty shoot-out; the first Scottish Challenge Cup final to be decided this way. In a best-of-five, Craig Brewster took the first penalty for Dundee United which was saved by Stenhousemuir goalkeeper Roddy McKenzie. Both clubs scored each of their next penalties which meant Stenhousemuir won 5–4. The result was notable in that Dundee United progressed through every round of tournament without conceding a single goal and still lost the final.\nRoute to the final.\nStenhousemuir.\nAlong with Cowdenbeath, Stenhousemuir received a random bye into the second round. The draw in the second round saw Montrose travel to Ochilview Park with The Warriors winning 3–1. The reward for reaching the quarter-final was an away game against Dundee at Dens Park with Stenhousemuir producing a 3–0 victory and first clean sheet of the tournament to progress to the semi-finals. The opposition was an away game against Stirling Albion, who had ground shared with Stenhousemuir in 1992–93. The game was played at Albion's new Forthbank Stadium which saw Stenhousemuir win 2–1 to send the club into the Scottish Challenge Cup final for the first time in its history.\nDundee United.\nDundee United faced a trip to Stranraer in the first round which saw the team emerge 2–0 winners. The second round was the first and only home game of the tournament for Dundee United with the visitors in the form of Hamilton Academical with United producing a 3–0 victory at Tannadice. A trip to Clydebank was the reward for reaching the quarter-finals with Dundee United edging the opposition out to win 1–0, in the process completing a third consecutive clean sheet. Dunfermline Athletic provided the opposition for Dundee United in the semi-finals with the team producing a 4–0 victory at East End Park and a fourth consecutive clean sheet of the tournament. Dundee United reached the Scottish Challenge Cup final for the first time.\nPre-match.\nAnalysis.\nStenhousemuir had played only one game at their home of Ochilview Park and two away in the games preceding the final. Dundee United also played one home game but played three away from home. Despite receiving a bye into the second round, Stenhousemuir amassed a total of eight goals scored with only two conceded, whilst keeping one clean sheet. Dundee United scored a total of ten goals and conceded none before the final, thus amassing a total of four clean sheets. This was the first appearance for both Stenhousemuir and Dundee United in the Scottish Challenge Cup final since its inauguration in 1990.\nPost-match.\nDundee United failed to concede a single goal throughout the entire tournament but still lost the final in the form of a penalty shootout against Stenhousemuir. This was Stenhousemuir's first national silverware since 1902."

The arena was heavily renovated in 1989. During the summer of 2011, The Citadel completed additional renovations to the Field House, building a new floor and revamping the Bulldogs locker room. Since the 1989 renovations, the Bulldogs have played before full capacity on three occasions: Duke (1991), South Carolina (1997), and College of Charleston (1999). Like all Citadel athletic teams, the Bulldogs utilize strength and conditioning, medical, and video spaces in Seignious Hall.\nHonored jerseys.\nThe Citadel created the honored jersey in 2009, beginning with Les Robinson. Banners hang in McAlister Field House for each honored jersey. Since Robinson, four additional jerseys have been added. Pat Conroy's jersey was honored most recently, on February 3, 2018.\nCoaches.\nBelow is a list of all coaches at The Citadel and their records through the 2020–21 season.\nRivalries.\nThe primary Bulldog rivals, as in other sports, are VMI, Furman, and College of Charleston. The Citadel also has historical rivalries with other schools within the state. The Bulldogs' records versus each rival are listed below, through the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "The Kansas City Royals Baseball Academy (also known as the Royals Academy and the GCL Royals Academy) was a part of the player development system of the Kansas City Royals in the early 1970s. The Royals are an American professional baseball team based in Kansas City, Missouri. An innovation conceived by Ewing Kauffman, the franchise's original owner, the goal was to develop quality athletes into major-league-caliber ballplayers for the organization. The only three Academy students who graduated to the majors were Ron Washington, U L Washington and Frank White. The concept was discontinued in May 1974.\nFacilities.\nConstructed at a cost of about US $1.5 million, the academy was located on of land just southeast of Sarasota, Florida. The facilities consisted of two buildings and five baseball diamonds, each built to the exact specifications of the one at Royals Stadium which opened in April 1973. That meant all the fields had AstroTurf playing surfaces, sliding pits around the bases instead of a full dirt infield, uniform 12-foot (3.66 m) outfield walls and measurements of 330 ft (100.58 m) down the foul lines, 385 ft (117.35 m) in the power alleys, 410 ft (124.97 m) to straightaway center field and 60 ft (18.29 m) from home plate to the backstop. The academy was dedicated on March 21, 1971, with Kauffman, Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn and American and National League presidents Joe Cronin and Chub Feeney in attendance.\nThe facilities are now part of Twin Lakes Park, which was purchased by Sarasota County in 1986. It was renamed the Buck O'Neil Baseball Complex on March 8, 1995. Various major league ballclubs have used it in the decades following the academy's closure. The latest is the Baltimore Orioles, beginning with the start of spring training in 1990, and continuing since 1991 as the site of its minor league camp.\nFaculty.\nAll seven of the academy's instructors had playing experience in Major League Baseball. They were Bill Fischer, Joe Gordon, Tommy Henrich, Steve Korcheck, Jim Lemon, Johnny Neun and Chuck Stobbs. Gordon had been the major league Royals' manager in 1969, the franchise's inaugural season. Korcheck was the academy's coordinator of instruction. Among the other members of the faculty, two were from the sport of track and field – Wes Santee and onetime University of Kansas coach Bill Easton. Mickey Cobb, the academy's athletic trainer, served in a similar capacity with the parent club in Kansas City from 1977 through 1990.\nOperations.\nThe project began on September 11, 1969 when Kauffman officially announced plans to start the academy. Syd Thrift, who was already employed in the Royals' scouting department, was appointed as its director. In February 1970, Thrift asked high school coaches from around the United States to recommend boys who were both fine athletes regardless of sport and interested in attending the academy. By June and July of that same year, 7,682 young athletes between the ages of 16 and 21 attended tryout camps which were arranged in 41 states. Of the 42 who were accepted for the first class, none were scouted by any of the major league ballclubs and eight had never played the sport at the high-school level.\nEach of the athletes selected for the 10‐month course received a $5,000 scholarship and a monthly salary of $100 for the first three months, $150 for the next three and $200 for the last four. They also got transportation to Sarasota, dormitory accommodations, three diet‐planned meals a day, health and life insurance, emergency dental care and a round‐trip plane ticket home for the Christmas holiday, all at the team's expense. Attendance at the academy included an educational requirement in which each individual had to fulfill 12 credit hours at Manatee Junior College. The players took classes in the morning. Kauffman recommended that the courses taken involved business and public relations out of concern for the players' financial well-being in the future. Expenses for books and room and board was paid by the Royals."

As of the next college basketball season in 2023–24, the Lady Flames compete in Conference USA (C-USA). They are currently coached by Carey Green.\nHistory.\nLiberty was founded in 1971 as Lynchburg Baptist College, making it the second-youngest institution in NCAA Division I (only Florida Gulf Coast University, founded in 1991, is younger). While men's basketball began play a year later, women's basketball did not start play until 1975, the same year in which the school changed its name to Liberty Baptist College and joined the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). In 1980, LBC joined the NCAA as a Division II member while retaining its NAIA membership. In 1983, LBC gave up its NAIA membership and moved full-time to D-II. They were members of the East Coast Athletic Conference (for a brief amount of time in 1983) and the Mason-Dixon Athletic Conference (1983–88) in their time in Division II. During that time, LBC adopted its current name of Liberty University in 1985.\nLiberty joined Division I in 1988, followed by a move to the Big South Conference in 1991. After a 5–22 season in 1995–96, the Lady Flames went 22–8 the next year while running the table and winning the Big South championship, their first ever conference title in history along with the bid to go to the NCAA tournament; they were beaten by Old Dominion 102–52 in the first round. The following year, they set the school record for most wins in program history along with a second straight Big South Tournament title and NCAA appearance with an undefeated regular season and wins in the conference tournament to go 28–0 before a loss to Tennessee 102–58 in the first round of the NCAA tournament (they tied the record for wins in 2008, going 28–4, including a Big South title). They have won just two NCAA Tournament games (2005), advancing to the Sweet Sixteen as a #13 seed after beating Penn State 78–70 and DePaul 88–79 before losing to #1 LSU 90–48 in the regional semifinals. They have also made an appearance in the WNIT (2016), losing to Villanova 67–51 in the first round. As of the end of the 2015–16 season, the Lady Flames have an all-time record of 674–469."

The host United States and China played to a scoreless draw following double golden goal extra time. After that, the United States won the title 5–4 with a penalties victory.\nThe match represented one of the most important events in the history of American athletics. It was played before over 90,000 fans. The well-known image of Brandi Chastain celebrating the winning spot kick that was featured on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\" became one of the defining images of women's athletics in the United States.\nFinalists.\nThe match featured two powerhouses of women's association football. The United States had won the first Women's World Cup in China and the gold medal at the 1996 Olympics. China had won the silver at the 1996 Olympics and had defeated the United States in the final of the 1999 Algarve Cup. The teams featured two of the superstars of women's soccer, strikers Mia Hamm of the United States and Sun Wen of China.\nThe United States was bidding to become the first team to win a world championship on home soil, something China had failed to do in 1991, as well as the first team to win multiple championships. China, meanwhile, was attempting to join the United States and Norway as World Cup champions.\nChina were the first Asian national team to reach the FIFA Women's World Cup Final. This was also the first Women's World Cup final not involving a European team.\nRoute to the final.\nThe United States had qualified automatically as host nation. Accordingly, they elected to skip the 1998 CONCACAF Women's Championship, which served as the CONCACAF qualifier. They would not fail to win a CONCACAF championship again until 2010. China had qualified by winning their sixth straight AFC Women's Championship in 1997.\nOnce at the finals, the United States reached the knockout stage by easily winning Group A. After trailing 2–1 at halftime, they advanced through the quarterfinals by defeating Germany 3–2. The United States then defeated Brazil 2–0 to reach the final.\nChina reached the knockout stage by winning Group D. They shut out Russia in the quarterfinals, then easily defeated defending champion Norway 5–0 to reach the final.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe match was played on July 10, 1999, at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. The United States and China played to a scoreless draw during regulation and golden goal extra time. The United States won the title 5–4 on a penalty shootout. The win gave the United States its second world cup title.\nThe game was a tepid affair with neither side getting many chances. Perhaps the best chance for either team to score came in extra time, when China's Fan Yunjie hit a header toward the post that was defended by Kristine Lilly.\nAfter both teams failed to score, the teams squared off for a shootout to decide the winners of the cup. China shot first, and Xie Huilin scored, only to be matched by the United States' Carla Overbeck. In the second round, Qiu Haiyan's goal was matched by Joy Fawcett.\nLiu Ying was China's third-round shooter, but her shot was saved by United States goalkeeper Briana Scurry. Despite Scurry coming well off her line (a violation that should have resulted in a re-kick for Liu), the save stood. Kristine Lilly then got a shot past Chinese goalkeeper Gao Hong to give the United States the advantage.\nZhang Ouying, Mia Hamm, and Sun Wen each converted their penalty opportunities, leaving the United States' Brandi Chastain with a shot to win the tournament. She put the ball past Gao, leading to an ecstatic celebration by the Americans, who had clinched the title on home soil.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Line-ups /&gt;\n&lt;section end=Line-ups /&gt;\nPost-match.\nThe United States became the first team to win two Women's World Cup titles. Brandi Chastain's celebration, which ended with her removing her jersey and revealing her sports bra underneath, appeared on the covers of \"Sports Illustrated\", \"Time\", and various newspapers the following day. The celebration was criticized for being disrespectful, unfeminine, or inappropriate, but has endured as one of the most iconic moments in women's sports history. Chinese media protested Scurry's save on Liu Ying, accusing her of cheating for stepping ahead of the line before Liu kicked the ball; Scurry confirmed that she did intentionally step over the line, but stated that \"everybody does it\".\nThe final and tournament as a whole created greater interest in women's soccer, particularly the United States team, and broke attendance and television records for women's sports. Its reported attendance of 90,185 set a new international record for a women's sporting event, although the unofficial 1971 Women's World Cup final at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City was seen by an estimated 110,000 people. This record was broken in 2022 when the second leg of the UEFA Women's Champions League quarterfinal between archrivals FC Barcelona and Real Madrid drew 91,553 to Camp Nou in Barcelona. The final averaged 17.9 million viewers and peaked at 40 million on U.S. broadcast television, which remained unsurpassed until the 2014 men's World Cup and the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup Final."

The Panthers play their home games at Georgia State's Panthersville sports complex in the GSU Baseball Complex.\nHistory.\nThe Georgia State Panthers baseball team first began playing in 1956 led by head coach Herbert \"Stony\" Burgess. The team would begin competition in the newly formed Sun Belt Conference in 1979 before moving to the Trans American Athletic Conference (TAAC) in 1984. The team joined the CAA in 2006.

The Lobos have won three conference tournaments, finished first in regular season conference play eight times, and appeared in the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship five times. The team plays their home games on the University of New Mexico campus at Santa Ana Star Field. Tod Brown has been the head coach of the Lobos since the 2022 season.\nHistory.\nThe first team was fielded in 1899 and has a 1,820–1,645–16 (.523) record through the 2022 season.\nThe 2022 season was the 105th season that the University of New Mexico has field a baseball team (the team did not play 19 seasons: 1902, 1903, 1909, 1918, 1924–1926, 1928, 1930–1938, 1944, and 1945).\nIn 1951, the Lobos began play in the Skyline Eight Conference, recording a first place regular season finish in the Eastern Division in 1953, 1958, and their final season in the conference in 1962. The 1962 season also saw the Lobos participate in the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship for the first time.\nUNM was a charter member of the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) and begin conference play with Arizona, Arizona State, BYU, Utah, and Wyoming in 1963. Until leaving the WAC to become a charter member of the Mountain West Conference (MW) in 2000, the Lobos finished first in the regular season standings only once, 1985 in the Southern Division, and lost to BYU in a postseason playoff series.\nAs a member of the MW, the Lobos have finished first in the regular season in six seasons: 2000, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2017. The Lobos returned to the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship in 2000, the second time in program history. The Lobos won the Mountain West Conference baseball tournament in 2011, 2012, and 2016.\nThe Lobos have had 27 different players earn All-America honors. Additionally, they have had 11 players be named Freshman All-America. In 2013 D. J. Peterson became the first player in program history to become a three-time All-American.\nUNM has had 93 players selected in the MLB Draft in its history, including a pair of first-round picks: Kevin Andersh in 1985, and Peterson in 2013. Since Birmingham took over the team has had 24 players selected, including a school-record seven in 2013. \nNew Mexico student-athletes have set numerous NCAA records including season batting average (Keith Hagman, 1980 - .551), most triples (Hagman, 1980 - 17), RBIs in an inning (Jonathan Gallegos, 8 - vs. Utah, March 13, 1993) and doubles by a freshman (Peterson, 32 - 2011). The team also has several records including hits by both teams (68 vs. Fresno State - April 1, 1999), triples in a game (7 vs. CSU-Pueblo - March 27, 1976) and plate appearances in an inning (25 vs. Utah - March 13, 1993).\nBallparks.\nSanta Ana Star Field.\nSanta Ana Star Field is the home of UNM baseball. After spending nine and a half seasons across the street at Isotopes Park, UNM returned to Santa Ana Star Field for good on March 24, 2013, as the Lobos hosted a doubleheader against the Nevada Wolf Pack.\n\"We need to have our own place to play,\" said head coach Ray Birmingham. \"The kids deserve their own field to practice and play on, and now we have that. They've earned it.\"\nSanta Ana Star Field received a major upgrade that started before the 2013 season. It received a FieldTurf playing surface, upgraded scoreboard, dugouts, bullpens, and bleachers as a part of the first phase of the Lobo Field renovation. Further renovations enhanced the concession areas, the fan plaza between Lobo Field and the softball field, the press box and the bleachers. Lights were installed in the fall of 2013, and a new clubhouse was dedicated December 28, 2016.\n\"We have lights because of (former Lobo) Dee Dennis and a bunch of guys who chipped in to help me and Dee do this,\" Birmingham said. \"This is Lobo Field. This is (the state of) New Mexico’s baseball field, at least that’s how I feel about it. ... There will not only be Lobo games on here, but there will also be state championship games here. We hope to bring in some great big tournaments over the years to this city and let our kids experience the world. We think New Mexico kids can get the rest of the experiences that the rest of the country has, then they will grow faster and realize they’re as good as anybody.”\nAfter nine years at Isotopes Park, the Lobos returned to Lobo Field in March 2013. From 2013-2022, the team has a 94-38-1 (.711) record at home.\nOn December 16, 2015, UNM announced it had reached a 10-year, $1 million deal with Bernalillo company Tamaya Enterprises to rename the stadium Santa Ana Star Field. UNM used the money for further renovations to the field.\nIsotopes Park.\nThe Lobos played at Isotopes Park from 2003 until partway through the 2013 season when they returned to Lobo Field full-time. \nPeople.\nHead coaches.\nThe Lobos' head coach since the 2022 season has been Tod Brown. Ray Birmingham had a record of 467–413–4 (.531) in fifteen seasons at head coach. He took over for Rich Alday, who coached the Lobos for 18 season (1990–2007) and posted a record of 515–513–3 (.501). Prior to him Vince Cappelli was coach for 13 seasons from 1977-89, and he obtained a record of 384–350–6 (.523).

        "text": "Peter Hudson (born 20 April 1984) is an English darts player. He joined the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) in 2010 but failed to qualify for any of the television majors. Hudson earned a full PDC Pro Tour card for the 2011 and 2012 seasons via the PDC's Qualifying School.\nCareer.\nIn 2011, Hudson qualified for the 2011 UK Open. He made an appearance on the TV stage, coming back from 3–0 down to defeat Magnus Caris 4–3 in the last 96 stage, winning the decider with a ten-dart leg. However, he then lost to Peter Wright in the last 64 in an untelevised match.\nAlso in 2011, Hudson came within one leg of qualifying for the PDC Grand Slam of Darts. He defeated Nathan Davies, Barrie Webb, \nKevin McDine, Keegan Brown and Mark Jones before losing his final qualifying match 4–3 against Ian White.\nHudson's best result in 2012 was at the seventh Players Championship of the year, where he beat the likes of Mervyn King and Robert Thornton, before losing to Ronnie Baxter 6–1 in the quarter-finals. Hudson beat Jamie Lewis to reach the last 64 of the UK Open for the second successive year. There he played Kim Huybrechts and lost 9–4. He qualified for three of the five new European Tour events, losing in the first round in two of them. In the other, the German Darts Masters he saw off Alan Tabern 6–4, before being defeated by reigning world champion Adrian Lewis 6–1 in the second round.\nIt was these results which largely contributed to Hudson qualifying for the World Championship by finishing 44th on the 2012 ProTour Order of Merit, claiming the 13th of 16 spots that were awarded to non-qualified players. In his first appearance at the World Championship he lost to James Wade 3–0 in sets in the first round, as he took just two legs during the match. Hudson was ranked world number 55 after the event.\nAt the 2013 UK Open, Hudson lost 5–4 to Mark Lawrence in the second round. He qualified for three European Tour events during the year but lost in the first round on each occasion. His best results came in the second half of the season in the eighth and fifteenth Players Championship where he lost in the last 16 6–1 to Paul Nicholson and 6–3 to Michael Smith respectively.\nHudson advanced to the third round of the UK Open for the third time in 2014, but narrowly lost 9–8 against Ian White. At the penultimate Players Championship of 2014 he saw off Dan Russell, Peter Wright, Benito van de Pas and Kim Huybrechts to make the quarter-finals of a PDC event for the first time, which he lost 6–4 to White. He finished 2014 outside of the top 64 on the Order of Merit and did not enter Q School.\nHudson qualified for the 2015 UK Open by winning the Riley's Sheffield qualifier, but lost 5–4 to Rob Smith in the first round. He claimed the first title of his career at the 14th Challenge Tour event by beating Ryan Palmer 5–4.\nAt the second UK Open Qualifier of 2016, Hudson advanced to his second ever PDC quarter-final and lost 6–3 to Phil Taylor. He was knocked out 6–4 in the second round of the UK Open by Dirk van Duijvenbode. Six wins saw him reach the final of the fourth Challenge Tour event, where he lost 5–4 to Bryan de Hoog. A second last 16 appearance in a main tour event this year came at the 11th Players Championship and he was beaten 6–2 by Robbie Green.\nAt the first UK Open Qualifier of 2017, Hudson defeated Benito van de Pas 6–4 to reach his first semi-final in a PDC event where he was whitewashed 6–0 by Peter Wright.\nPerformance timeline.\nPDC"

In 2014, it won its first World Championship by defeating Canada. In winning the world championship, the Steelers became the second nation in history to hold both the Paralympic and world championship titles concurrently.\nWheelchair Rugby Australia (WRA) established in 2022 is responsible for the development and growth of the sport of wheelchair rugby in Australia. The sport is not included at the Special Olympics or the Deaflympics.\nThe game.\nThe sport is one of the few contact sports available for wheelchair sport athletes and was originally known as \"Murderball\". It was developed in Canada during the 1970s and made its way to Australia in 1981.\nThe sport uses a volleyball for the ball and combines elements of basketball, soccer and ice hockey. The game is played on a basketball sized court. Each team has four players on the court at any one time.

The game features a full tournament mode in addition to four different pitches (including a plastic pitch which caused controversy in the 1980s for some English football clubs). The game's two-player mode largely requires on luck instead of skill to make plays like goals and free kicks. While the graphics are standard for the Super NES, the \"jerky\" scrolling destroys the limited playability that exists in the game.\nEach game has a large field along with a massive variety of options and a signature overhead view; making the game similar to \"World Championship Soccer\" for the Sega Mega Drive; however, the viewpoint is much to be desired and the almost complete lack of gameplay spoil all the enjoyment out of the game. Ball handling controls tend to be extremely difficult despite the simplistic approach to soccer. A variety of moves, including the aftertouch, are fully accessible with by only using one button on a standard joystick. This is a feature that is exclusive to this game and not found even on modern soccer games.\n\"Pro Soccer 68\".\nPro Soccer 68 was released for the Sharp X68000 in 1991. It was developed by SPS and published by Imagineer. \"Pro Soccer\" (known in Europe and US as \"Super Kick Off\") was also released for the Game Boy in 1992."

In 1899, Georgetown took the intercollegiate baseball world by storm, winning 18 of 20 games against college teams, beating national powers Princeton and Yale three times each and Virginia twice. The Hilltoppers reached the pinnacle of college baseball when they were acclaimed intercollegiate national champions at season's end. \nUpon their triumphant return from their northern trip at the conclusion of that year, the championship team was escorted from the train station to Georgetown in a torchlight parade led by a carriage of top university officials and included students on horseback, alumni, students from the three schools, and the college band. They were greeted with fireworks once back on campus. The team was once known as the Stonewalls, and is one possible source of the Hoya Saxa cheer famous among all Georgetown sports teams. Georgetown has yet to make an appearance in the NCAA Division I baseball tournament. From 1987 to 2014, the Hoyas did not even reach the Big East tournament, and it was only in 2023 that they won a Big East tournament game.\nFacilities.\nThe Hoyas have played their home games at Capital One Park in Tysons, VA, since 2024.

European Championships 2004 in Budva were the joint seventeenth European championships (the other event would be held the next month in Maribor, Slovenia) and were the fourth W.A.K.O. championships (including world) to be held in Serbia and Montenegro/Yugoslavia. The event was open to around 300 amateur men and women from 26 nations from across Europe.\nThe styles on offer at Budva included; Full-Contact, Low-Kick and Thai-Boxing – with women's Thai-Boxing competitions introduced for the very first time at a W.A.K.O. championships. The other less physical competitions (Light and Semi-Contact, Musical Forms, Aero Kickboxing) would take place at the event in Maribor. By the end of the championships Russia was easily the top nation with a huge medal collection across all styles, hosts Serbia and Montenegro trailed way behind in second and Belarus were in third. The event was held over six days in Budva, Serbia and Montenegro, starting on Tuesday, 19 October and ending on Sunday, 24 October 2004.\nFull-Contact.\nFull-Contact is a form of kickboxing where both punches and kicks are exchanged between participants with full force applied to strikes, and attacks below the waist are prohibited. Most matches are settled either via a point's decision or stoppage victory and all contestants are obliged to wear head and body protection as is customary with most forms of amateur kickboxing. More information on Full-Contact and the rules can be found at the official W.A.K.O. website. At Budva the men had twelve weight divisions ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs, while the women had seven ranging from 48 kg/105.6 lbs to over 70 kg/+143 lbs. Although there was not the same number of high-profile winners in Full-Contact as with previous championships, there were several repeat winners who had won at the last world championships in Paris, with Jere Reinikainen, Igor Kulbaev, Maxim Voronov, Olesya Gladkova and Maria Karlova all winning gold, while Milorad Gajović would go on to compete in the 2008 Olympics as an amateur boxer. By the end of the championships Russia was the strongest nation in the style, winning a huge haul of ten gold, four silvers and four bronze medals across the male and female events.\nLow-Kick.\nSimilar to Full-Contact kickboxing, contestants in Low-Kick are allowed to kick and punch one another with full force, with the primary difference being that in Low-Kick they are also allowed to kick one another's legs, with matches typically won by decision or stoppage. As with other forms of amateur kickboxing, various head and body protection must be worn. More information on the style can be found at the W.A.K.O. website. Both men and women took part in Low-Kick at Budva, with the men having twelve weight divisions ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs, and then women having six ranging from 48 kg/105.6 lbs to 70 kg/154 lbs. Notable winners included future K-1 fighters Michał Głogowski and Łukasz Jarosz, while Dejan Milosavljevic had also won gold at the last European championships in Jesolo. By the end of the event, as with Full-Contact Russia were easily the strongest nation in Low-Kick, winning a massive ten gold, six silver and two bronze medals across the various male and female competitions.\nThai-Boxing.\nThe most physical type of kickboxing available at Budva, Thai-Boxing (more commonly known as Muay Thai allows the participants to kick, punch, use elbows and knees to score points, often resulting in a stoppage victory. As with other forms of amateur kickboxing all contestants must wear head and body protection. At Budva both men and women took part in their own Thai-Boxing competitions with women competing for the first time at a W.A.K.O. championships. The men had twelve weight classes ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs, while the women had just the two, the 51 kg/114.4 lbs and 65 kg/143 lbs divisions. There were not many recognisable names on the winners list at Budva although future pro world champion and K-1 contestant Magomed Magomedov and emerging talent Andrei Kotsur picked up gold medals. By the end of the championships Belarus were once more the strongest nation in Thai-Boxing with six gold, two silver and two bronze medals."

His replacement was Paul Burdett who would join the club from Killamarsh to join youngster Gareth Curtis opening the batting who had impressed towards the end of the previous campaign, he was also joined at the club by Steven Ludlam from Killamarsh and would prove a huge addition to the Millers bowling attack particularly shining in important moments for the club. 2009 player of the year Matt New returned for the start of the campaign after a winter spent in Australia plus first team promotions for Mark Smallwood and Adam Dobb on a more regular basis gave the side a youthful look skippered again by Keshara Jayasinghe. The Mills season would begin with a home Derbyshire cup fixture against Sandiacre Town CC after a humbling 9 wicket defeat to the Derbyshire side in the previous campaign the Millers were determined to show what they were capable of enjoying a comprehensive 158 run win with Professional Paul Burdett enjoying a dream debut scoring 143 built around an explosive innings of 93 by Sudesh Fernando. Early league form was much more unpredictable wins against the Notts Academy and Wollaton were spoiled by games in which the side threw away against Kimberley Institute and Caythorpe. The Derbyshire cup quickly began to look like a competitor the Millers could be competitive in and followed the comprehensive win over Sandiacre with a more convincing 187 run win over Alvaston and Boulton with Youngster Gareth Curtis and Matt New striking 76 and 84 runs respectively in the Mills score of 271 before dismissing Alvaston for 84. Early success in the ECB national cup was also provided early season against Wickersley Old Village with 16-year-old Adam Dobb showing considerable character and no little skill bowling 8 overs at the end of the innings to secure the Mills a place in the next round. Progress in the Derbyshire Cup was secured after a rain affected match against Ilkeston and Rutland gave the Mills the needed point to progress, although those wondering what the result may have been in this clash did not need to wait too much longer. The lingering threat of relegation was a slight possibility for the Millers but those fears were eased with an away victory over Attenborough with Mark Smallwood stepping up to deliver with 56 to see the Mills to a 4 wicket victory with 23 balls to spare. This was backed up with an impressive double of the Notts Academy with Sudesh Fernando scoring a magnificent hundred to build on the opening stand by Curtis and Burdett of 80 at a run a ball and impressive death bowling by Steven Ludlam and Captain Keshara Jayasinghe clinching all 20 points for the Millers. Runaway Derbyshire Premier League leaders Lullington Park visited The Fieldings for the Derbyshire cup final in a game where the Mills were firm second favourites to the Derbyshire side, Opener Gareth Curtis took the attack to the bowlers with 78 at better than a run a ball supported by a patient 53 from Paul Burdett in bowler friendly conditions the Mills posted a competitive 220. At 103-4 Lullingtons reply was underway and the game in the balance 3 wickets for only 5 runs turned the match and the Mills progressed through to the semi-finals winning by a 46 run margin where they would take on Spondon. Although wins were still proving tough to come by in the league the Mills picked up vital points with away wins over Wollaton and Radcliffe with Kyle Garside showing his worth with a 5 wicket haul and vital losing draw points at home to champions elect Clifton. As it had looked likely the season would depend on success in the Derbyshire Cup after being eliminated from both the National cup and the Twenty 20 without much fuss. The semi final with Spondon was to prove problematic with both Dobb and James Fraser being ruled out through injury and being replaced by Craig Scholes and Mills veteran Darren Johnson, Spondon were to bat first and appeared to be crushing to the final after reached 95-0 in rapid time with former Derbyshire player Ben Ashdown leading the assault but regular wickets allowed the Mills to restrict them to a par total of 232 well reachable for a place in the final. The Mills reply started off well but regular wickets left the team at 67-3 and in big trouble of capitulating, however the team seemed to have more strength in this competition than in the league and Gareth Curtis and Sudesh Fernando added 96 for the 4th wicket for Fernando at his best hitting 64 during the partnership with Curtis just occupying the crease allowing Fernando to dominate. When Curtis departed for 59 it allowed the captain Jayashinghe and Johnson to both hit key innings with Johnson in particular scoring 21 off 15 balls with Fernando departing for 89 the game my have swung back to Spondon but Ludlam showed his all round ability to deliver under pressure and saw the team home and helping the Mills progress to the Derbyshire Cup final where they would meet Ilkeston and Rutland. Premier League status was secured with a comprehensive 8 wicket victory over Neighbours Welbeck with ex Nottinghamshire and Midlands player Craig Gould impressing with a fast bowling 5 wicket haul as the Mills dismissed the hosts for only 91. The most interesting thing about the Derbyshire cup final day was the selection headache facing captain Jayasinghe as late as 5 minutes before the toss, the availability of talisman fast bowler Kieran Garside meant that someone would have to miss out on selection, it came down to a straight decision between Scholes and Fraser with Fraser being given the nod over the unlucky Scholes who had performed well during the campaign. Captain Jayasinghe won the toss and chose to bowl with Ilkestons main threat being provided by Derbyshire opener Chesney Hughes and Ilkeston captain and the competition's leading run scorer David Smit. The Mills could not have predicted it could go so well with Garside providing his worth dismissing Hughes thanks to an incredible catch by Ludlam, Ludlam would then himself come into the attack to contribute figures of 9-2-19-4 showing once again his ability to perform under pressure. A simple run chase however this was never going to be as Mills were rocked at 40-4 and then 68-5. The bright light being the incredible composure shown by Mark Smallwood occupying the crease waiting for a willing partner he found one in Fraser who decided to play the way he knows how hitting two giant sixes into grandstand to send the team into hysterics and secure the trophy for the Mills. Steve Ludlam was righty awarded man of the match for his brilliant display of bowling with the trophy rounding of an exciting season for a young side playing in a very competitive standard. Steve Ludlam was also voted player of the season.\n2011 season review.\nThe Mills were to go into the 2011 season with high optimism that they could improve on last season's league position and defend the Derbyshire Cup. However the close season departure of Gareth Curtis to champions Clifton would leave a gap at the top of the order with Youngster Rob Townsend promoted from within to fill Curtis shoes at the top of the order. Lewis Saxby arrived to improve the depth in the bowling department although Adam Dobb would be unavailable in league matches due to Notts Academy commitments but would continue to perform in Cup competitions. On the eve of the new season Curtis would however returns to the Mills having been unable to secure a place in the Clifton side he returned to the Mills to compete with new openers Smallwood and Townsend. Smallwood and Townsend staked their intentions for the opening slot with a 50 opening stand away at Kimberley in a disappointing but in terms of points gained acceptable opening day performance. Curtis would return to the side following his transfer at home to Papplewick with Townsend unavailable he would slot in to the opening spot and returned in style scoring 103 his maiden premier league hundred as the Mills chased down a score in excess of 250 to record a key win. The young Millers would welcome back Professional Paul Burdett for the trip to champions Clifton but after a promising start in which the Mills reduced Cliftons powerful batting line up to 86-4 former Derbyshire professional Tom Lungley and Richard Harris steadied the ship with the latter hitting a brilliant 107, In reply on Curtis and Fraser managed to come to terms with the powerful bowling attack and the Mills succumbed to a heavy defeat. The disappointment was short lived as the Mills won a close national cup game the next day against Elsecar with Gareth Curtis hitting 88 the Mills posted 183 which would prove 30 too many for Elsecar as 3 wickets for Steve Ludlam ensured victory for the Millers. Disappointing league performances against the West Indian Cavaliers and Nottinghamshire Academy although James Fraser showed his undoubted potential in the Academy game hitting a brilliant 74* not out to give the Mills full batting points. These results were surrounded by both Derbyshire Cup and National Cup matches the first being an incredible game against Chesterfield at Queens Park, the Mills posted a par score of 225 slightly disappointing after being 79-0 and 110-1, Matt New returned to form with 71 and Curtis fell one short of his half century with 49 and a quick fire 38 off just 27 balls from captain Jayasinghe gave the Mills some momentum going into the field. The Mills bowlers showed excellent control but struggled to dominate the match on what was a very good batting strip and with 4 needed from 4 balls the batsmen struck it out to long off where Matt New ran and retrieved the ball but unfortunately slipped on the wet outfield and it was clear from his screams that it was a bad injury later reported to be a broken leg and he would miss 4 months action. The Chesterfield batsmen decided they would run regardless of the injury and the umpire decided to award them 3 runs much to the amusement of the Millers, with 1 run needed from 3 balls Ludlam faced an impossible task, whatever fate was looking over the Mills following News injury is not clear but something was at work that day as Ludlam bowled the final 3 balls for 0 runs ensuring a tie when the match seemed certain for defeat. The national cup match saw a trip down the A1 to Doncaster with Paul Burdett showing he was returning to form with a brilliant 127* not out supported by 47 from Dobb and 65* not out from Fraser who was really maturing as a batsman in this campaign. In the reply Steve Ludlams 4 wickets ensured the Mills would again progress to the third round of the National cup. With the cup runs over for the time being the Mills recorded two vital league wins over Cuckeny firstly where an all round team batting performance saw the Mills chase 251 for victory with Burdett scoring 78 and Fernando seeing the team home alongside Fraser with 63 and 39 respectively. A potential relegation all battle with Kiveton Park resulted in a comfortable winning draw for the Millers with Gareth Curtis hitting his second hundred of the season 111* not out and a cameo from Steve Ludlam at the end of 47* not out seeing the Mills posted 287 with Kiveton struggling to reach the total they secured Losing draw points with Fernando taking 3 wickets for the Mills. The Mills returned to cup action with a trip to Hyde CC for the third round of the National cup to be played on a soaking wet wicket with the home side batting very well to post 226 helped by the wicket beginning to dry out during the day in reply the Mills were progressing steadily with Curtis and Jayasinghe already putting 50 on for the third wicket and the score 77-2 when 3 run outs in the space of 30 minutes decimated the innings with Curtis departing for 49 and Jayasinghe 30 a match in which the Mills can take as much blame as Hyde could take credit for the exit from the cup. Even more disappointing was the exit from the Derbyshire Cup as a rained off match at Home to Lullington Park saw the Mills eliminated despite being undefeated in their defence of the competition. The team got back to winning ways a home to Belvoir who boasted former Nottinghamshire Opening batsmen Darren Bicknell in their ranks, the Mills knew this was a must win game and posted a massive 297 with Curis and Fernando adding 131 for the third wicket Curtis departing for his third ton of the season with 141 and Fernando with 81, 3 wickets for Keshara Jayasinghe ensured the points would go the Mills with a comfortable winning draw secured and relegation fears eased. The Mills would rack up 290 again in the league this time away at Papplewick with Fernando batting expertly to score 124* not out of just 107 deliveries with captain Jayasinghe striking 36 and Fraser adding a cameo of 22, Fernando would also weight in with 3 wickets to ensure the points went the way of the Millers. The Mills continued their liking for playing the Notts Academy with a winning draw at home when defeat seemed inevitable the Mills had posted a mammoth 293-7 with Curtis, Fernando and Jaysinghe all scoring half centuries however at 200-2 with Hassan Azad and Oliver Swann batting beautifully the Academy were cruising, Captain Jayasinghe decided to turn to part-time spinner Robert Townsend who turned the game on its head with the incredible figures of 7-2-13-6 with the Academy falling 60 runs short and Townsend ensuring heroic status amongst his teammates. Survival was again secured with an away victory at Kiveton Park with Curtis hitting his 4th hundred of the season and half century's from Burdett and Fernando ensured a total beyond Kivetons reach, Fernando would also claim a 5 wicket haul showing his all round talents. The highlight of the season for the team had to be the home match against Caythorpe where Kieran Garside after a tough season struggling through lack of form finally returned to his very best taking 8 wickets for 27 runs in a truly incredible spell of bowling clean bowling 5 of his victims much to the delight of his teammates who had been desperate to see their teammate perform like he could. A season which saw no silverware but with young talent progressing through the ranks indeed young Joe New hit the youngest 50 ever in the Notts premier league aged just 13 in the home defeat to Welbeck showing the future would be bright with the club sticking by young talent. Player of the season was Gareth Curtis\n2012 season review.\nThe winter months of 2011 were a busy time for the Mills management with much comings and goings to the side from the previous campaign. The marquee signing was Tom New rejoining the club following his release from Leicestershire and he would join the side as Batsmen wicket keeper, Adam Dobb was also to rejoin the club following his release from the Notts Academy and would form a key spin trio with Matt New and Sudesh Fernando. Unfortunately the team said goodbye to Paul Burdett and Steve Ludlam two guys who had fitted in extremely well to the club and been key parts of the cup success enjoyed by the Mills over the previous campaigns, Mark Smallwood also said goodbye deciding that opportunities would be easier to come by at Worksop and made the move to the Bassetlaw side. Perhaps the biggest disappointment was the departure of Kieran Garside to Cuckney, the fast bowler had really found his form towards the end of the campaign and his loss was a real blow to the Mills ambitions. Jonathan Salmon and Billy North were promoted to the first team squad to cover the gap left by Garside later filled by Ashley Holland who was to join the club during the campaign. The season began with a trip to Cuckney with the game being played on a wicket clearly affected by the weather but the willingness of both sides ensured a match was played with Cuckney bowling a depleted Mills line up out for under 50 to give the season an early knock back. The team bounced back winning away at Wollaton with Tom New and Sudesh Fernando both scoring half century's and 6 wickets for Matt New put the mills back on track. An exciting National cup tie at home to Whitley Hall followed with Craig Gould in outstanding form striking 174* not out in the Mills 271 however Whitley Hall batted with incredible intent and knocked the Mills score off with 5 overs to spare, a remarkable run chase but the Mills should have scored more runs on what was a very good wicket."

The Pirates stayed for just one season (2005–06), playing twelve matches, moving to the Camborne Recreation Ground for the 2006–07 season. The move to Kenwyn was considered to be justified as the average attendance increased by 40% on the previous season.\nHistory.\nThe Kenwyn Ground was previously used by Truro Rugby Club in the early part of the 20th century and was the playing field for Truro Cathedral School for many years."

        "text": "Reece Robinson (born 15 May 1992 from Hull) is an English professional darts player who competes in Professional Darts Corporation events.\nCareer.\nRobinson came to prominence in major darts at the 2010 UK Open along with fellow young players Joe Cullen, William O'Connor and Arron Monk. He reached the last 64 before losing to PDC World Darts Championship finalist Simon Whitlock by 9 legs to 5. Later that year, he won the Winmau World Youth Masters, defeating Kurtis Atkins in the final.\nRobinson joined the PDC Pro Tour in 2011. He received a one-month ban from the Pro Tour in February 2011, for \"dangerous and reckless throwing of darts\" at a Youth Tour event in Derby.\nAt the 2011 UK Open, he reached the last 32, defeating Barrie Bates, Wayne Mardle, and Wayne Jones along the way. His run was ended as he narrowly lost 9–8 to Andy Smith. On 11 June 2011, Robinson won his maiden PDC Youth Tour event in Barnsley, beating Shaun Griffiths 4–0 in the final.\nIn May 2012, he earned a place in the German Darts Championship in Berlin by defeating Ian Jopling in the UK qualifier. He beat Richie Burnett in the first round 6–2, before losing to fifteen time world champion Phil Taylor 6–2 in round two. He also reached the fourth European Tour Event, the German Darts Masters and was defeated by Colin Osborne 6–2 in the first round in Stuttgart.\nRobinson headed into 2013 ranked number 85 in the world. He played in the majority of Challenge Tour events and was a losing semi-finalist twice before he reached the final of the 16th event where he lost 4–0 to Dimitri van den Bergh. In January 2014 he entered Q School in an attempt to earn a two-year PDC tour card, but he could not advance beyond the last 128 on any of the four days.\nRobinson based his 2014 around Youth and Challenge Tour events. He lost in the final of the eighth Youth Tour event 4–2 to James Hubbard, but won the 12th event by beating Van den Bergh 4–2. Robinson also reached the quarter-finals of the Under-21 World Championship, where Kurt Parry knocked him out 6–3.\nThe best Robinson could do in 2015 and 2016 was one quarter-final in a Development Tour event.\n2017 saw Robinson start to ply his trade on the PDC Challenge Tour without overwhelming success, a last 16 his best result in the year. However, a weekend in May 2018 seemed to change his fortunes as he made two last 16s and a last 32 before reaching a semi-final in the final Challenge Tour weekend of the year. This stood him in good stead going into PDC UK Q-School in January 2019 as he beat three-time BDO World Champion Glen Durrant 5–2 on the final of day three to seal a two-year PDC Tour Card and win it back after six years without one."

Players can enter up to four characters (letters and numbers) for their name. Wind speeds are shown in meters per second. Water hazards notifications appear in big gray letters.\nIn addition to stroke and match play, players can obtain passwords that allow spectacular shots to be re-enacted as if they were the spectator (eagles, holes in one, and double eagles). Beginners can learn gameplay strategies from watching expert players while they use their hard-earned passwords. Mode 7 effects permits the usage of elevation in certain camera angles.\nDevelopment.\nDuring the mid-1980s, various \"Hole in One\" video games were released in Japan by HAL Laboratory for the NEC PC88 and MSX. The Super Famicom version can be considered as the sequel to the Family Computer video game \"Jumbo Ozaki no Hole in One Professional\" released in 1988. The Japanese version was named after legendary Japanese golfer Jumbo Ozaki, who has played golf on a professional basis since 1973. Takashi Saitou designed the stages.\nReception.\nAllGame gave \"Hal's Hole in One Golf\" a score of 3.5 stars out of a possible 5."

        "title": "Batting average (cricket)",
        "text": "In cricket, a players' batting average is the total number of runs they have scored divided by the number of times they have been out, usually given to two decimal places. Since the number of runs a player scores and how often they get out are primarily measures of their own playing ability, and largely independent of their teammates, batting average is a good metric for an individual player's skill as a batter (although the practice of drawing comparisons between players on this basis is not without criticism). The number is also simple to interpret intuitively. If all the batter's innings were completed (i.e. they were out every innings), this is the average number of runs they score per innings. If they did not complete all their innings (i.e. some innings they finished not out), this number is an estimate of the unknown average number of runs they score per innings.\nEach player normally has several batting averages, with a different figure calculated for each type of match they play (first-class, one-day, Test matches, List A, T20, etc.), and a player's batting averages may be calculated for individual seasons or series, or at particular grounds, or against particular opponents, or across their whole career.\nBatting average has been used to gauge cricket players' relative skills since the 18th century.\nValues.\nMost players have career batting averages in the range of 20 to 40. This is also the desirable range for wicket-keepers, though some fall short and make up for it with keeping skill. Until a substantial increase in scores in the 21st century due to improved bats and smaller grounds among other factors, players who sustained an average above 50 through a career were considered exceptional, and before the development of the heavy roller in the 1870s (which allowed for a flatter, safer cricket pitch) an average of 25 was considered very good.\nCareer records for batting average are usually subject to a minimum qualification of 20 innings played or completed, in order to exclude batsmen who have not played enough games for their skill to be reliably assessed. Under this qualification, the highest Test batting average belongs to Australia's Sir Donald Bradman, with 99.94. Given that a career batting average over 50 is exceptional, and that only 4 other players have averages over 60, this is an outstanding statistic. The fact that Bradman's average is so far above that of \"any\" other cricketer has led several statisticians to argue that, statistically at least, he was the greatest athlete in any sport.\nDisregarding this 20 innings qualification, the highest career Test batting average is 144 by Kurtis Patterson, who scored 144 runs and was dismissed once in his two Test innings. He then fell out of the Australian squad due to a loss of form and injury.\nBatting averages in One Day International (ODI) and T20 International (T20I) cricket tend to be lower than in Test cricket because of the need to score runs more quickly. Consequently, batters tend to play riskier strokes and less emphasis is placed on building an innings in order to amass a high individual score. It should also be remembered, especially in relation to the ODI and T20I histograms above, that there were no ODI or T20I matches when Bradman played.\nInterpretation.\nIf a batter has been dismissed in every single innings, then this statistic gives exactly the average number of runs they score per innings.\nHowever, for a batter with one or more innings which finished not out, the true mean or average number of runs they score per innings is unknown as it is not known how many runs they would have scored if they could have completed all their not out innings. In this case, this statistic is an estimate of the average number of runs they score per innings. If their scores have a geometric distribution, then this statistic is the maximum likelihood estimate of their true unknown average.\nBatting averages can be strongly affected by the number of not outs. For example, Phil Tufnell, who was noted for his poor batting, has an apparently respectable ODI average of 15 (from 20 games), despite a highest score of only 5 not out, as he scored an overall total of 15 runs from 10 innings, but was out only once.\nA batter who has not been dismissed in any of the innings over which their average is being calculated does not have a batting average, as division by zero does not give a result.\nLeading male batting averages.\nTest matches.\nA batting average of above 50 is considered by many as a benchmark to distinguish between a good and a great batsman. Highest male career batting averages in Test matches as follows:\nFirst-class.\nHighest career batting averages in first-class cricket as follows:\nOne Day Internationals.\nHighest career batting averages in One Day International cricket as follows:\nAlternatives.\nAlternative measures of batting effectiveness have been developed, including:\nStrike rate.\nStrike rate measures a different concept to batting average – how quickly the batsman scores (i.e. average number of runs from 100 balls) – so it does not supplant the role of batting average. It is used particularly in limited overs matches, where the speed at which a batter scores is more important than it is in first-class cricket. Strike rate may also be used to compare a player's ability to score runs against differing types of bowling (i.e. spin, fast bowling).\nPlayer rankings.\nA system of player rankings was developed to produce a better indication of players' current standings than is provided by comparing their averages."

Australia was hoping to play in the FIFA World Cup for the first time since 1974, and Argentina was hoping to qualify after reaching the FIFA World Cup Final three times in the previous four FIFA World Cups. The only time that Argentina failed to qualify for a FIFA World Cup was in 1970. This qualification play-off notably immediately followed Argentina's 5–0 defeat by Colombia at home in Buenos Aires on 5 September 1993. The crowd of 43,967 who watched the first leg played at the Sydney Football Stadium was at the time a stadium record crowd for any sporting event.\nThe series were notable for being the first time Argentina had to play a qualification play-off match in their history. Moreover, the series saw the return of Diego Maradona to the national team after a long dispute with manager Alfio Basile. Some years later, Maradona suggested that drug tests were deliberately avoided during the series, stating that \"to play against Australia, the Association gave us a 'fast coffee'\" to drink before the match."

        "text": "The basketball tournaments of NCAA Season 87 are the Philippines' National Collegiate Athletic Association tournaments for basketball in its 2011–12 season. University of Perpetual Help System DALTA hosted the season, starting with an opening ceremony held on July 2, 2011 followed by a triple-header game. Games then are subsequently being held at Filoil Flying V Arena, with men's games on Wednesdays, Fridays and select Monday games aired by Studio 23.\nIn the men's tournament, the San Beda Red Lions successfully defended their championship, sweeping the San Sebastian Stags in a rematch of the last two championship series. Both teams started undefeated, with San Sebastian winning the first round finale against the Red Lions, finally ending San Beda's league record 26-game winning streak. The Stags extended their winning streak to 15 games until they were defeated by the Letran Knights. The Red Lions, after being beaten by the JRU Heavy Bombers, ended the second round with a six-game winning run. They beat San Sebastian in the last elimination round game to force a playoff for the first seed, a game they subsequently won. The Red Lions then met JRU in the semifinals, which also had their own six-game winning run after a 3–9 start. The Red Lions won, advancing to the finals for the sixth consecutive year. The Stags and the Knights met in the other semifinal, where the Knights extended the series to a deciding game; the Stags won on Game 2 to qualify for the finals anew. In the Finals, San Beda won Game 1 convincingly, while the Stags missed on a chance to force overtime on Game 2 to give San Beda their second consecutive title. Dave Marcelo was named the Finals MVP.\nIn the juniors' tournament, the San Beda Red Cubs won all 18 elimination round games to qualify outright to the finals with the thrice to beat advantage. The EAC-ICA Brigadiers, a team under probation, qualified for their first NCAA playoff appearance; they were beaten in the first round of the stepladder series by the La Salle Green Hills Greenies to face the Letran Squires in the next round. The Greenies led for much of the game until they quelled an end-game rally by Letran to clinch the school's first NCAA finals berth. The Greenies prevented a Red Cubs season sweep, winning Game 1 of the finals.\nPreseason.\nThe San Sebastian Stags announced that their former coach Turo Valenzona had been named as their new head coach, four months after Ato Agustin left to coach the San Miguel Beermen in the Philippine Basketball Association. Valenzona had previously coached the Stags in the 1990s, winning four consecutive championships from 1993 to 1996, with the 1996 season finishing undefeated. Valenzona would be the league's oldest head coach at 68 years old.\nPaul Nuilan and Marlon Gomez, the two players from the UPHSD Altas who were not allowed to play last year, were cleared to play this season. This gave coach Boris Aldeguer optimism for the upcoming season.\nIn the preseason tournaments, defending champions San Beda Red Lions were defeated by the UAAP champions Ateneo Blue Eagles in the final of the Filoil Flying V Pre-Season Cup 75–56. The Red Cubs defeated the Philippines under-16 basketball team 79–70 to win the juniors event, with Francis Abarcar being named most valuable player. San Beda's Garvo Lanete and Yousef Taha of the Mapúa Cardinals were named members of the mythical team. In the Father Martin Cup, Mapua was defeated by the NU Bulldogs of the UAAP in the men's final, 87–83 in overtime.\nThe league announced a partnership with SM Supermalls in marketing the league; next season's basketball tournaments are to be held at the yet-to-be-finished SM Arena, as the arena is accessible to most of the member schools. Also, in an effort to \"go green\", the league announced that the tickets used for the basketball tournaments will be produced under an environment-friendly system. The creation of ticket-on-demand system prevents the accumulation of unsold tickets that are stored every year, and reduces the amount of paper used.\nThe UPHSD Altas announced on June 27 that head coach Boris Aldeguer resigned. While no reason was given, sources of the \"Philippine Daily Inquirer\" stated that the non-inclusion of a UPHSD player by the NCAA board was the cause of his resignation. Aldeguer's assistant Jimwell Gican was named as the new head coach. While the NCAA board allowed UPHSD player Marlon Gomez to play after sitting out last season to residency, UPHSD president Anthony Tamayo announced that he will not be entered during the games; this also came after the board disallowed another player, Paul Nuilan, who allegedly misrepresented documents on his transfer from Far Eastern University to Letran to Perpetual. Gomez was almost cleared to play for Perpetual in 2010 until JRU showed documents that he had enrolled there after transferring from Philippine Christian University.\nThe San Sebastian Stags announced that head coach Turo Valenzona was elevated as team consultant, while Topex Robinson was named as the new head coach days prior to the opening. Robinson was Valenzona's player during San Sebastian's 1996 title run and won another title with the Stags in 1997 before turning professional.\nMen's tournament.\nThe men's tournaments began on July 2, 2011 after the opening ceremonies at the Araneta Coliseum, Quezon City. Thereafter, the rest of the first round games are currently held at the Filoil Flying V Arena, San Juan.\nTeams.\nChanges from last season.\nGuest team:\nPostseason teams.\nSan Beda Red Lions.\nWith Borgie Hermida leaving the team and Sudan Daniel not playing due to an injury, the Red Lions had to find other ways to keep its championship form. Fresh from last season's sweep, the Red Lions had an 8-game winning streak to start the season adding up to a 26-game winning streak. The streak was ended by the San Sebastian Stags, last year's runner-up. With the Red Lions hoping that it would be the only loss they will have this season, JRU gave them their second loss after a 2-week break. With that loss, the Red Lions made sure they won't have another loss this season. They defeated the Stags on the last day of elimination with both teams tied for the top spot. A playoff was held and the Red Lions won which gave them the top seed and the Stags settling for second. This was another great year for the school as they finished as champions and the juniors team also ending up as champions giving them a back-to-back double championship title.\nSan Sebastian Stags.\nLast season's runner-up was seeking for redemption against the defending champions, the Red Lions. The Stags started the season with an impressive 15-game winning streak only to be ended by the Letran Knights. Because of this, some fans thought that the 85th season would repeat as for the saying \"history will repeat itself\". Many were hoping that even though the Red Lions will take the top seed, the Stags will still be the champions. The loss of Borgie Hermida and Sudan Daniel made them confident that they will defeat the Red Lions in any game. They gave the Red Lions their first loss since the 85th season with the so-called Pinatubo Trio contributing most of the team's points. The second round meet-up with the Red Lions was pretty disappointing for the school with the fans confident they will take it also like they did in the first round meeting. The Pinatubo Trio was not in action during that game and their performance was pretty disappointing with the game ending at 70-91 in favor of the Red Lions. Before that meeting, the Stags already had its first loss given by the Knights with the game ending at 81-82 with overtime. As the Stags were tied up with the Red Lions for the top spot, a playoff was held with the Red Lions winning it.\nLetran Knights.\nWith the Letran Knights finishing with a disappointing 5th place last season, the team had to find depth from all the players. Last season was their first time not being in the final four in years as they are seen as one of the dominant teams, it was pretty embarrassing. They started the season with a 3-game winning streak to be ended by the Stags with a 62-71 game in favor of the opponent. Another loss was given to them by the defending champions, the Red Lions, with a lopsided 62-77 game. Although they weren't upset that they lost to these teams, th second round gave them some disappointments. They lost to the UPHSD Altas, a team seen as one of the weakest teams as they always finish in last every season recently. Although in their next game, they won against the Stags giving them their first loss of the season. The team might be celebrating from this win, their next game was against San Beda. Again, they lost to the Red Lions with their coach frustrated how they can win against the Stags but not against the Red Lions. They ended the season with a satisfactory 3rd-place finish with a record of 14-4 and a loss from San Beda.\nJRU Heavy Bombers.\nThe Bombers started the season with a back-to-back loss from the San Sebastian Stags and the Arellano Chiefs. Their first win is against the EAC Generals, the team that finished in last place this season. With the Bombers finishing 3rd place last season, the Bombers was still looking for an end to their 38-year title drought, the longest in the history of the NCAA. They were defeated by the Altas in their fifth game, frustrating their head coach and the school shocked. This was followed by another back-to-back losses from CSB Blazers and the defending champions, the San Beda Red Lions. Their first round was very disappointing and isn't showing the light for ending their title drought. Their second was, fortunately, was pretty impressive. They might have started the round with a 3-game losing streak but countered it with a 6-game winning streak up until the end of the eliminations, in it is a win against the Red Lions giving the Lions their second and last loss in the season.

        "title": "Cricket in Western Australia",
        "text": "Cricket is one of the most popular sports in Western Australia. The governing body of the game in WA is the Western Australian Cricket Association (WACA). Western Australia is represented at Sheffield Shield and domestic one-day level by the Western Warriors, and in the Big Bash League by the Perth Scorchers.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe first cricket match recorded in Western Australia was played between the builders of Government House and the commissariat store. No scores were recorded, but the \"Perth Gazette\" wrote: \"the revival of the sports of our native country in a distant land forms a connection which it should be our pride to encourage.\" The first clubs formed were the Perth Cricket Club, the Guildford Cricket Club and the Tradesmen of Perth. Perth and the Tradesmen of Perth who played a match in May 1846. Other matches were played in the country centres of York, Bunbury, Toodyay and Beverley during the same period.\nA club was formed in Fremantle in 1852, and matches between Perth and Fremantle commenced in November 1852, played on the Perth Recreation Ground on the present site of Wellington Square. The match was attended by the Governor and Colonial Secretary, with food and entertainment in the form of a band being provided. The \"Perth Gazette\" noted \"the field was graced by nearly all the beauty of the metropolis\". The inaugural contest was won by Perth, who defeated Fremantle by three wickets, with the player Wellman taking six wickets for Perth in the first innings. Three brothers A., C. and E. King played on the side of Perth.\nIn 1879, a team from the Benedictine mission at New Norcia, organised by Henry Lefroy and the abbot Rosendo Salvado and mainly consisting of Aboriginals, was formed. The team played matches against teams from nearby Northam and York, and also \"toured\" Perth and Fremantle, winning most of their matches. Later the same year, the Metropolitan Cricket Club, formed from the amalgamation of the Perth and Perth Union Cricket Clubs, travelled to New Norcia, winning a match against the team by a narrow margin.\nThe Western Australian Cricket Association was formed on 25 November 1885, with Magistrate John James named as the inaugural president of the association. In 1889, James secured a grant of 28 acres from Governor Frederick Broome on the foreshore at East Perth, with a 999-year lease. Frederic North was named as the first secretary of the association.\nThe Western Australia cricket team played their opening first-class matches on a tour of the Eastern states during the 1892–93 season, playing two games – against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval, losing by 10 wickets, and against Victoria at the MCG, losing by an innings and 243 runs. The team was captained by Herbert Orr.\nA team organised by George Giffen toured Western Australia in 1896, playing five matches at Coolgardie, Kalgoorlie, Fremantle, Perth and Northam.\nThe WACA Ground was opened in November 1893, with the first curator being William Duffy, who also played two matches for Western Australia. A grandstand was built at the ground in 1895, seating approximately 500 people and incorporating dressing rooms, members' rooms and a bar. The initial first-class match played on the ground was between Western Australia and South Australia in April 1899, with South Australia winning by four wickets. Further sides visited the state before the start of World War I, with South Australia touring in 1905–06 and 1908–09, New South Wales touring in 1906–07, the MCC touring in 1907–08 and Victoria touring in 1909–10. Matches were played both at the WACA Ground and at Fremantle Oval. Western Australia managed to win two of these matches, against South Australia in January 1906, by 103 runs, and against New South Wales in March 1907, by 5 runs. The first century scored for Western Australia was by Ernie Parker, who scored 116 against South Australia in 1906.\nWestern Australia was invited to send a representative to the Board of Control in 1913.\nThe WACA recruited several well-known interstate cricketers to play for Western Australia during the early part of the 20th century, including Ernie Jones, Arthur Richardson and Ernest Bromley, who all played Test cricket for Australia.\nPost-World War I.\nSeveral cricketers from Western Australia fought in World War I, including Ernie Parker, Lionel Gouly and Jim Everett.\nAdmission to the Sheffield Shield.\nWestern Australia was admitted to the Sheffield Shield for the 1947–48 season. Keith Carmody was recruited from New South Wales to lead the inaugural side. Although playing a shortened schedule of matches compared to the other teams, playing each team only once instead of twice, Western Australia won the competition in the first year.\nNotable cricketers from the first few years of Western Australia's Sheffield Shield competition include Carmody, Allan Edwards, Wally Langdon, Laurie Sawle, John Rutherford, Ken Meuleman, John Munro and Basil Rigg. When selected for Australia's tour of India in 1956, Rutherford became the first Western Australian selected for an overseas tour, and the first to play a Test match.\nFrom the 1956–57 season, Western Australia played a full schedule of matches against other states. This coincided with a drop in success of the team, although several more players made their Australian debuts, including Meuleman, Ron Gaunt, Barry Shepherd, Des Hoare and Keith Slater. Bob Simpson was recruited to the state from New South Wales for the 1956–57 season, and had an immediate impact. He currently holds the Western Australian record for the highest first-class batting average, scoring 2,470 runs from 24 matches at an average of 79.67. His average for the 1959–60 season was 300.66, an Australian record.\n\"Golden Era\".\nWestern Australia won seven Shield titles during the period from 1967–68 to 1980–81, which coincided with the international debuts of players such as Bruce Laird, Dennis Lillee, Rod Marsh, Bob Massie, Bruce Yardley and Kim Hughes. In 1979 Hughes became the first Western Australia to captain the national side. Several international players were recruited to Western Australia during this period, including Tony Lock from England, Wayne Daniel from Barbados and Ken McEwan from South Africa.\nWorld Series Cricket.\nGloucester Park, a trotting track in Perth, hosted seven World Series International Cup matches and one SuperTest in 1978 as part of the World Series Cricket (WSC) competition organised by Kerry Packer. The Western Australian cricketers who signed with WSC were Ross Edwards, Bruce Laird, Rob Langer, Dennis Lillee, Mick Malone, Rod Marsh and Dennis Yagmich. These cricketers were barred from playing cricket for Western Australia for the time they were signed with WSC, but most returned to state cricket after the WSC-ACB truce in 1979.\nRecent years.\nThe Perth Scorchers were formed in 2011 to represent the state in the Big Bash League for the 2011–12 season.\nVenues.\nThe WACA Ground in Perth, Fremantle Oval in Fremantle, Hands Oval in Bunbury and the new Perth Stadium in Burswood have hosted major matches in Western Australia. Fremantle Oval is no longer used for cricket.\nGloucester Park, a racecourse in Perth, was used for World Series Cricket matches from 1977–79.\nLilac Hill in Midland hosted the annual Lilac Hill Match from 1990–2008, and also hosted a women's one-day international match between Australia and New Zealand in 2005.\nList of venues in Western Australia-:"

Originally focused on mixed martial arts (MMA), ONE has since expanded to regularly hold events featuring Muay Thai, kickboxing, and submission grappling bouts, while also previously promoting boxing and Lethwei matches. One held its first event on 3 September 2011 at the Singapore Indoor Stadium, and has since held over 200 events across Asia. \nONE is considered to be Asia's largest combat sports promotion, with investors including GIC and Temasek Holdings, in addition to ICONIQ Capital, Mission Holdings, Sequoia Capital and Greenoaks Capital. The promotion would reach a value of over $1 billion by October 2018. In 2022, ONE's parent company, One Group Holdings, changed its legal operations from Singapore to the Cayman Islands.\nSityodtong stated his goal was to create the first Pan-Asian martial arts company, and to promote \"values of integrity, humility, honor, respect, courage, discipline, and compassion\", which he believes Western MMA promotions have lost.\nOverview and broadcasters.\nONE Championship is operated by Group ONE Holdings, whose leadership and executive team are chairman and chief executive officer Chatri Sityodtong, vice chairman Saurabh Mittal, group president Hua Fung Teh, and chief financial officer Jesley Chua. Matches are made by matchmaker and Vice President of Operations, Matt Hume. In May 2014, former UFC Middleweight Champion Rich Franklin became a vice president of ONE Championship.

Every other region has them[...] But there is absolutely nothing like that on a pan-Asian basis.\" He chose Singapore as the promotion's base because of its location and communications infrastructure. As a life-long martial artist himself, Sityodtong would later state that he felt mixed martial arts (MMA) has been \"severely tainted by the west\", where the physical aspects have been glorified to extremes and \"anger, hatred, [and] controversy\" are commonplace. Unlike western promotions, ONE's main goal is to promote \"values of integrity, humility, honor, respect, courage, discipline, and compassion\". Sityodtong says ONE purposely recruits and employs competitors who \"are outstanding role models and good human beings with wholesome values\", \"You don't see any of the trash-talking or any kind of criminal offences or behavior you see in other promotions\". Although acknowledging he has respect for those Western promotions, Sityodtong explained, \"they approach it in a pure sports manner, whereas as we approach it in Asia as a martial arts approach, just in terms of positioning to the audience and everything else. That's very important\".\nSityodtong revealed that the first three years of ONE FC were a \"living hell\". He was turned down by many broadcasters, brands, advertisers, and even potential employees who did not understand ONE's vision. They \"mistakenly thought it was about fighting and violence\", but \"people don't watch because of the punch or the kick or the submission. People watch because their heroes are representing their country on the global stage of martial arts.\"\nFirst events.\nOne Fighting Championship held their first event, , on 3 September 2011 at the sold-out Singapore Indoor Stadium.

According to then-CEO Victor Cui, the change was made mostly for linguistic and cultural reasons. \"I think the reason why I picked the name ONE in the first place was because I wanted a name that transcended the language barrier. If you didn't speak English, you knew what 'one' was[...] It means the top, the best and everybody could say it\", but translating the English word \"fighting\" into dozens of Asian languages and passing it on to partners and sponsors had proven cumbersome.\nONE Championship and Ultimate Fighting Championship finalized the first \"trade\" in MMA history on 27 October 2018.

Superbon Singha Mawynn became the inaugural ONE Featherweight Kickboxing World Champion by knocking out Giorgio Petrosyan at on 15 October 2021.\nAt , an event to celebrate the organization's tenth anniversary, Mei Yamaguchi faced Danielle Kelly and Reinier de Ridder faced André Galvão in a pair of grappling matches on 26 March 2022. 17-year-old Smilla Sundell became the youngest champion in ONE history on 22 April 2022, when she defeated Jackie Buntan at ONE 156 for the inaugural ONE Women's Strawweight Muay Thai World Championship.\nONE awarded their first belt for submission grappling on 1 October 2022 at ONE on Prime Video 2, where Mikey Musumeci defeated Cleber Souza for the ONE Flyweight Submission Grappling World Championship. ONE Lightweight Kickboxing World Champion Regian Eersel became a two-sport champion when he defeated Sinsamut Klinmee for the inaugural ONE Lightweight Muay Thai World Championship at ONE on Prime Video 3 on 22 October 2022. The same event saw Kade Ruotolo win the inaugural ONE Lightweight Submission Grappling World Championship over Uali Kurzhev.\nONE held its first event in America, ONE Fight Night 10, at the 1stBank Center in Broomfield, Colorado on 5 May 2023. Colorado was chosen because its athletic commission was the first to approve ONE's rule set. The organization had initially planned on debuting in the US years prior, but was ultimately delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The event was the start of the promotion's expansion into the United States, where it will be opening offices in New York and Los Angeles with the goal of eventually holding 12 events in the country annually.\nAnti-doping policy.\nIn August 2022, ONE Championship announced an anti-doping partnership with \"International Doping Tests &amp; Management\", a subsidiary of Drug Free Sport International, who will independently handle all testing of its fighters for \"illegal substances\", beginning with ONE 160 that month. Although the organization planned to introduce World Anti-Doping Agency standard testing in 2019, prior to its partnership with \"International Doping Tests &amp; Management\", ONE had not publicly drug-tested its athletes.\nRules.\nMixed martial arts.\nONE Championship uses the Global Martial Arts Rule Set, which \"blends a combination of Best Practices from Asian and Non-Asian Rules\". Fighters wear 4-ounce MMA gloves. Matches vary in maximum length, depending on whether it is for a championship title. In all fights, each round can be no longer than five minutes. Most fights have a maximum of three rounds, with one minute breaks in between, but championship matches have a max of five rounds.\nVictory is attained by one of the following ways; knockout, submission, verbal tapout, technical knockout or technical submission by referee stoppage, request for stoppage by cornerman, by disqualification, by technical decision, or by judges' decision. Three judges score the bout in its entirety, not round-by-round, utilizing the following criteria in descending order of importance:\nIllegal targets for strikes are the groin, throat, trachea, and the back of the head, neck or spine. Stomps to the head of a grounded opponent, small joint manipulation, head butting, hair pulling, eye gouging, orifice insertion, spitting, and grabbing onto the cage fence are also illegal. Takedowns must not result in \"spiking or pile driver[s] to the head or neck\". Soccer kicks to the head of a grounded opponent were previously legal in the competition, initially via an \"open attack\" rule, which required fighters to get permission from the referee to use them. In September 2012, the company adopted the Pride Fighting Championships' rules on the technique, allowing fighters to use soccer kicks without asking for permission from the referee. Soccer kicks were banned entirely in August 2016 as part of the company's worldwide expansion plans. Sityodtong stated that despite studies showing that soccer kicks are the same as a normal head kick to a standing opponent because you cannot generate any more pivotal force, the technique invites \"bad publicity\".\nKickboxing and Muay Thai.\nONE Championship uses the Global Kickboxing Rule Set and the Global Muay Thai Rule Set. In kickboxing, fighters wear boxing gloves, with athletes weighing at or below 65.8 kilograms (bantamweight) wearing 8-oz gloves and athletes weighing above wearing 10-oz gloves. In Muay Thai, fighters wear 4-ounce mixed martial arts gloves. Matches vary in maximum length, depending on whether it is for a championship title. In all fights, each round can be no longer than five minutes. Most fights have a maximum of three rounds, with one minute breaks in between, but championship matches have a max of five rounds. ONE Muay Thai allows elbow strikes, clinch fighting, sweeps and throws.\nFights can be won via:\nFights are scored round-by-round by three judges using the 10-point must system. If the points tally is equal, then the judges utilize the \"ONE Judging Criteria\" to determine a winner:\nSubmission grappling.\nONE utilizes the Global Submission Grappling Rule Set. Matches consist of a single 10 minute round. Victory can be obtained by submission, verbal tapout, referee stoppage \"due to imminent danger\", request for stoppage by cornerman, or by judges' decision. Three judges score the bout by the number of catches, or \"legitimate\" submission attempts. If there are an equal number of catches, the grappler who was awarded the last catch will be named the winner. If there are no catches, the judges will award victory to the athlete who showed more aggression. Yellow cards are issued to grapplers who stall. Once an athlete is issued a yellow card, the only way that athlete can win is by submission. Prior to May 20, 2022, submission grappling matches could only be won via submission and were automatically declared a draw after a 12 minute time limit.\nWeight divisions.\nONE Championship currently uses ten different weight classes:\nUnlike most MMA organizations, these weight limits are based on a competitor's \"walking weight\", rather than pre-fight weigh-ins.\nThe change took place after the death of 21-year-old Chinese fighter, Yang Jian Bing (who was supposed to face Geje Eustaquio) on 11 December 2015, due to dehydration by weight-cutting in the Philippines.\nThe promotion banned weight-cutting by dehydration in order to promote fighter safety. The promotion’s revised policy on weight mandated that athletes are monitored in their training camps, and have urine specific gravity tests to ensure they are hydrated up to three hours ahead of their bouts. Since the new measures took effect, there have been no further serious incidents.\nThe new system was well received by athletes in the organization, as well as other stakeholders in the MMA industry.\nOn February 18, 2023, Dr. Oliver Barley revealed that the urine specific gravity tests were ineffective. Barley described the tests as being “ridiculously easy” to cheat and also admitted to having helped some ONE Championship athletes pass their hydration tests with weight cuts.\nEvents.\nONE Warrior Series.\nIn November 2017, it was announced that ONE VP Rich Franklin would head up a competition called the \"ONE Warrior Series\", searching for up-and-coming martial artists in Asia. The prize is a six-figure contract with the organization, with the winner determined based on their performance instead of victories. The most recent edition of the ONE Warrior series in its initial format was ONE Warrior Series 10, which aired on February 19, 2020. \nONE Warrior Series: Philippines.\nOn September 12, 2022, ONE Warrior Series made a brief return as a reality television show titled \"ONE Warrior Series: Philippines\". The show featured 16 mixed martial arts fighters in the Philippines competing for a $100,000 contract to compete in ONE Championship. Team Lakay members Joshua Pacio and Geje Eustaquio were featured on the show as coaches. The show premiered on September 18, 2022 and featured 12 episodes.\nONE Super Series.\nOn February 12, 2018, ONE Championship announced the establishment of the \"ONE Super Series\", which would feature kickboxing and Muay Thai bouts. The first event that featured bouts under Muay Thai and kickboxing rules was in Manila on 20 April 2018. The promotion signed notable names such as Giorgio Petrosyan, Nong-O Gaiyanghadao and Fabio Pinca to feature on the bill. Since the inception of ONE Super Series, some events have used a five-roped ring, instead of the ONE circular cage, which had been used exclusively up until 2018. The ONE Super Series kickboxing bouts adopt the oriental ruleset. As of 2020, ONE Super Series kickboxing bouts use boxing gloves. In ONE Super Series Muay Thai bouts, open-finger 4 oz gloves are used. The first ONE event to consist entirely of ONE Super Series contests was in Ho Chi Minh City on 6 September 2019.\nONE Infinity.\nOn 13 February 2020, ONE announced the launch of the \"Infinity\" series, events consisting of at least three championship fights and a minimum of 12 world champions.\nONE Lumpinee.\nIn September 2022, ONE announced a partnership with the Royal Thai Army to hold at least 52 shows in 2023 at the Lumpinee Stadium in Bangkok, Thailand. The weekly events started with ONE Friday Fights 1 on 20 January 2023, where Nong-O Gaiyanghadao successfully defended his bantamweight Muay Thai title with a TKO of Alaverdi Ramazanov in the third round. The event finished as the most-watched show in prime time in Thailand, with a 3.9 rating among males 15 years old and over, according to data collected by Nielsen. It was broadcast locally on Thailand's Channel 7. The event predominately features Muay Thai, but also includes MMA and kickboxing bouts. They are broadcast live in 154 countries, and reportedly offer the highest purses in Muay Thai history.\nRoster.\nIn May 2022, Sityodtong stated ONE Championship had 600 fighters in the organization.\nFighter salary.\nFighter salaries in Asia are not publicly disclosed, unlike in the US, so information about ONE FC's fighter purses is not in the public domain. However, in January 2014 Ben Askren revealed that he was being paid a minimum of US$50,000 per fight as well as a US$50,000 win bonus.\nA cash bonus known as the \"ONE Warrior bonus\" was introduced on 9 July 2014 and implemented for the first time at on 11 July 2014.\nAn award of US$50,000 is given out at the end of certain events to the fighter who impresses the most in terms of:\nVictor Cui stated that bonuses would be handed out on a discretionary basis: \"For every event, the bar will be very, very high. If a few fighters impress me, then I will hand out the bonus to a few fighters. If no one impresses me, then no one will get it. Extraordinary performance deserves extraordinary rewards. Ordinary performances deserve ordinary rewards.\"\nThe \"ONE Warrior bonus\" of $50,000 was re-introduced in January 2022, with a minimum of one bonus and a maximum of five bonuses awarded at each event.\nRankings.\nThe rankings for ONE Championship's fighters are both recorded and updated when information has been obtained from the promotion's official website.\nTournament winners.\nONE Grand Prix Champions\nMalaysia GP Champions\nCambodia GP Champions\nChina GP Champions\nMyanmar GP Champions\nCross-promotional partnerships.\nIn 2017, ONE entered into a partnership with World Lethwei Championship parties agreed on sending athletes to fight in each other's organization.\nIn January 2019, ONE entered into a partnership with Shooto, according to which Shooto champions would be given a contract with ONE Championship.\nThey entered into a similar partnership with Indonesian promotion One Pride MMA in December 2020.\nOn February 18, 2021, ONE partnered with American promotion Ringside United Fighting (RUF Nation). The partnership saw RUF hosting a \"Road to ONE\" 16-man heavyweight MMA tournament, with the winner getting a $100,000 contract to compete in ONE Championship. \nOn May 6, 2022, ONE partnered with Thailand-based Fairtex Fight Promotion. Fairtex Fight Promotion would begin hosting a series of \"Road to ONE\" Muay Thai tournaments for three different weight classes in July, offering a $100,000 contract to compete in ONE Championship. \nOn May 27, 2022, ONE announced a partnership with UK-based Muay Thai Grand Prix. The partnership would see MTGP hosting \"Road to ONE\" tournaments in two different weight classes, with the winners receiving a ONE Championship contract worth $100,000.\nOn November 19, 2023, ONE partnered with the UK-based Muay Thai promotion Hitman Fight League. The partnership will see Hitman Fight League host two \"Road to ONE\" four-man tournaments, with the winners receiving a £5,000 cash prize and the opportunity to compete on ONE Friday Fights at Lumpinee Stadium.\nFinancials.\nPer the company's 2021 publicly available financial statements, the company has generated an accumulated net loss of US$383 millions. The company's dire financial performance and rumored potential bankruptcy have been widely reported by the MMA journal, Bloody Elbow. When confronted with questions related to the poor financial performance and non-standard financial reporting, Chatri Sityodtong has repeatedly avoided directly answering reporters on the matter. There is also the ongoing question of what portion of the company's reported revenue is actually from non-cash barter transactions, including an unexplained US$400,000,000 barter transaction to a related company for \"intellectual property rights\".\nFinancial scrutiny of ONE Championship has increased since 2018, particularly regarding its accounting practices. The organization's barter transactions, previously a distinct category, have been integrated into broadcasting and sponsorship revenue. This change has made it more difficult to discern the proportion of revenue derived from cash versus non-cash transactions, potentially obscuring the organization's financial health.\nAccording to Kristie Neo from DealStreetAsia, financial projections indicate that ONE Championship's financial resources could be depleted by the third quarter of 2024. The organization reportedly generated revenue between $5-8 million in 2022, a modest figure for a promotion of its size. ONE Championship also faced organizational challenges, implementing two rounds of layoffs between March and July 2023, affecting 12 to 15 staff members each time.\nIn 2021, ONE secured significant funding, raising $150 million through investments from the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and Guggenheim Investments. Despite this influx of capital, reports as of November 2023 suggest that these funds are nearly exhausted. Furthermore, investment enthusiasm in Qatar has waned, with key local partners Qatar Airways and Ooredoo discontinuing their financial backing. This withdrawal of support has led to the postponement of a planned ONE event in Qatar, now rescheduled for 2024.\nControversies and allegations of favoritism.\nOn December 9, 2020, and January 6, 2021, \"Bloody Elbow\" published a two-part article detailing numerous allegations surrounding ONE Championship, mainly mistreatment of former fighters and employees.\nFormer employees and fighters reportedly fear expressing discontent with ONE Championship due to potential legal actions. The company's base in Singapore, known for expensive legal proceedings, exacerbates these concerns. An insider claimed that fighters under contract have low morale but are contractually unable to publicly criticize the company. ONE has allegedly threatened legal action over critical social media posts, including preemptive statements to news outlets and informing other employers of the fighters' actions. Fighters face restrictive contracts that enforce exclusivity without guaranteeing regular fights, leaving them financially vulnerable. Additionally, the contracts reportedly include clauses prohibiting public criticism of ONE. Insiders described pressure on fighters to sign contract extensions with minimal benefits. Herbert Burns reported being sidelined for years and denied a title shot after leaving Evolve MMA, a gym founded by ONE CEO Chatri Sityodtong that has connections with the promotion.\n\"For sure, that’s exactly it, but life goes on,” Burns said in an interview with MMA Fighting. “I spoke with the Evolve founder [Chatri Sityodtong] when I left (the team) and — apparently — everything was fine. I was going to fight for the belt, he congratulated me for the win. I came back home and kept training. For two years, they kept saying ‘you’ll fight at this month or that month,’ but the contract never came. I was always hopeful that I would fight, and that’s what bled me financially and forced me to fight for the money.”\nThere has also been skepticism regarding ONE's ticket sales, with reports of excessive distribution of free tickets and inflated claims of sold-out events. Financial records suggest a decline in ticket revenue despite an increase in the number of events. ONE has made bold claims about its market share and viewership in Asia, previously asserting a 90%+ market share and describing itself as the largest global sports media property in Asian history. However, these claims have been questioned by industry insiders and former PR head Loren Mack.\nONE's claims of reaching up to 85 million viewers per event and being available in over a billion households in Asia have been met with skepticism. The actual impact of their broadcast reach and brand recognition in Asia remains uncertain.\nAllegations have surfaced about ONE Championship favoring fighters from certain countries where the organization seeks expansion. Fighters from countries like Egypt and India are reportedly brought in with little experience, often losing to more accomplished fighters favored by ONE. For instance, Egyptian Top Team fighters have a combined record of 1 win and 22 losses in ONE, raising questions about matchmaking fairness. Fighters outside Asia reportedly face difficulties in negotiating pay and are often locked into lengthy contracts with restrictive clauses. In contrast, select fighters favored by management are said to receive monthly stipends in addition to fight purses.\nONE's relationship with Evolve MMA, both founded by Chatri Sityodtong, is criticized for potential favoritism and conflicts of interest. Herbert Burns, formerly with ONE and Evolve, highlighted issues with media control and biased matchmaking in favor of Evolve fighters. Claims suggest that Evolve’s business model and marketing strategies, including targeting high-earning professionals, raise further concerns about the intertwined nature of Evolve and ONE."

        "title": "1896–97 Challenge Cup",
        "text": "The 1897 Challenge Cup was the inaugural staging of the Northern Rugby Football Union's Challenge Cup and involved 52 clubs from across England from the 1896–97 Northern Rugby Football Union season. The tournament was played over six rounds in March and April 1897, culminating in the final which was won by Batley.\nBackground.\nThe Northern Union decided to hold a cup competition called the Northern Rugby Football Union Challenge Cup in July 1896. The cup was commissioned from Bradford silversmiths and jewellers, Fattorini and Sons. Fattorini's designed the trophy themselves and it cost the Northern Union £60.\nDraw.\nThe draw for the competition was made on 3 September 1896 although the matches were not due to be played until March and April 1897 over six consecutive weekends commencing 20 March 1897. All rounds were drawn at the same time with matches in the second and subsequent rounds given an identification letter such that ties for later rounds were expressed as, for example, \"Q. Winner of Round C. v. winner of Round N.\"\nThe team drawn first had the option to play at home or could agree to play at the opponent's ground. The semi-finals and final were to be played at neutral venues.\nFirst round.\nThe first round involved 20 matches and 40 clubs. 12 clubs (Batley, Bradford Church Hill, Brighouse Rangers, Crompton, Heckmondwike, Liversedge, St Helens Recs, Stockport, Swinton Church, Thornton Rangers, Tyldesley and Werneth) were given a bye to the next round.\nAll 20 ties were played on 20 March 1897.\nFirst round replays.\nThe three games requiring replays were all played on Wednesday 24 March\nSecond round.\nThe second round of 16 ties was played on Saturday 27 March 1897.\nSecond round replay.\nStockport and Eastmoor replayed the tie on Wednesday 31 March.\nThird round.\nThe third round of eight games was played on Saturday 3 April.\nThird round replay.\nSwinton and Rochdale replayed the drawn game on Wednesday 7 April.\nFourth round.\nThe quarter finals were played on Saturday 10 April 1897.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were scheduled for Saturday 17 April. However, due to a waterlogged pitch, the tie between St. Helens and Swinton, due to be played at Broughton Rangers ground - Wheater's Field - was postponed until Monday 19 April. The game between Batley and Warrington, played at Fartown, Huddersfield did go ahead on a very soft pitch.\nAfter the game Warrington lodged a protest over the result, claiming that the game should have been postponed due to the state of the pitch and that the game having gone ahead, the referee allowed the game to end six minutes short. Both grounds of protest were dismissed by the Northern Union Committee.\nThe rearranged game between St Helens and Swinton was played on Easter Monday, 19 April, watched by a crowd of 20,000 taking advantage of the bank holiday to attend.\nFinal.\nThe final took place on 24 April 1897 at Headingley, Leeds. The official attendance was 13,492, with gate receipts of £624.17s.7d. Batley wore white shirts and black shorts and socks in place of their normal cerise and fawn colours. St Helens wore blue and white hooped shirts, white shorts and black socks.\nSt Helens won the toss and elected to have Batley kick off. Despite playing into the wind in the first half, Batley took the lead after five minutes when Joe Oakland, kicked a drop goal to give Batley a 4–0 advantage. Batley extended their lead to 7–0 when John Goodall scored the first try of the game. These were the only scores of the first half. Early in the second half St Helens scored a try when centre David Traynor took the ball on the halfway line and beat four Batley players before touching down. The St Helens fightback did not last long as Batley flanker John T. 'Paudy' Munns scored Batley's second try to make the score 10–3 which remained the score at the final whistle.\nAfter the game the cup was presented by Mrs Louisa Waller, the wife of the president of the Northern Union, Henry Hirst Waller. Mrs Waller presented the Batley players with commemorative gold medals and the St Helens players with silver medals."

        "title": "Organized baseball",
        "text": "Organized baseball is an archaic term that collectively describes Major League Baseball (MLB) and its various affiliated minor leagues, under the authority of MLB's Commissioner of Baseball. Historically, these leagues were bound by the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues (NAPBL), an agreement signed in 1901 that is considered the first to formally establish Minor League Baseball. The agreement included provisions to respect the player reserve lists of clubs in each league.\nOrganized baseball consisted of the two main \"major\" leagues, the National League and the American League, and the minor leagues governed by the rules of the NAPBL. Starting in 1947, the term also included several Caribbean winter leagues such as the Cuban League. It did not include Negro league baseball, and was racially segregated by the \"gentleman's agreement\" until . Independent baseball leagues not bound by the agreement were sometimes pejoratively referred to as \"outlaw leagues,\" due to their resistance to outside governance. Within the United States, the most notable major outlaw league was the Federal League of 1914–15, which lured players away from their established clubs with better pay (the first challenge to the \"reserve clause\" and a foreshadowing of free agency). The league's collapse led to a Supreme Court ruling in 1922 that effectively established an antitrust exemption for MLB and Organized Baseball.\nAnother notable \"outlaw league\" was the Mexican League, which rapidly expanded in the years immediately after World War II, bringing it into conflict with organized baseball. Starting in 1946, players who \"jumped\" their MLB clubs for more lucrative contracts in Mexico were blacklisted for having violated the reserve clause. Faced with a lawsuit seeking to overturn the 1922 ruling, MLB Commissioner Happy Chandler offered amnesty to the jumpers in 1949, thus keeping organized baseball's antitrust exemption intact. From then on, the Mexican League peacefully coexisted with organized baseball until 1955, when it was admitted as an affiliated minor league.\nToday, the term \"organized baseball\" is considered outdated, due to its ambiguous meaning and racial overtones; the Society for American Baseball Research instead recommends the term \"affiliated baseball\"."

        "title": "The Masters (novel)",
        "text": "The Masters is the fifth novel in C. P. Snow's series \"Strangers and Brothers\". It involves the election of a new Master at narrator Lewis Eliot's unnamed Cambridge College, which resembles Christ's College where Snow was a fellow. The 1951 novel's dedication is \"In memory of G. H. Hardy\", the Cambridge mathematician. It was the first of the \"Strangers and Brothers\" series to be published in the United States.\nPlot synopsis.\nThe novel is set in 1937, with the growing threat from Nazi Germany as the backdrop. The two candidates for election as new Master are Crawford, who is politically radical and prepared to make sure the college makes a stand against appeasing Hitler, but who Eliot believes will not be good at dealing with people; and Jago, who Eliot believes would make a good master, but whose wife is seen by some as a liability. Much of the interest of the novel lies in its analysis of the motives and political manoeuvres of the people campaigning for their chosen candidates.\nReception.\nA 1951 book review in \"Kirkus Reviews\" stated; \"While not wholly enmeshed in the earlier books, familiarity with them would enhance appreciation of this, which taken alone seems at times slow moving, the emphasis on character and background rather than advancing the plot.\"\nInspirations.\nThe plot of \"The Masters\" may be inspired by Barchester Towers by Anthony Trollope, in which an English city's bishop dies and a successor is selected.

        "title": "Notre Dame Fighting Irish baseball",
        "text": "The Notre Dame Fighting Irish baseball team is the intercollegiate baseball team representing the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana. Notre Dame competes as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference in the NCAA Division 1 college baseball league. The team is currently coached by Shawn Stiffler and plays its home games at Frank Eck Baseball Stadium, which has a capacity of 1,825. The school has appeared in three College World Series, in 1957, 2002, and 2022 and has won 6 conference titles.\nHistory.\nNotre Dame baseball began in 1892. The Fighting Irish's first game was against Michigan on April 21, in which they won 6 – 4. They did not have a season in 1893.\nIn 1897, Frank E. Hering became their first coach. Frank Hering arrived at Notre Dame to play quarterback for the Fighting Irish football team in 1896. By 1898, he had taken on the responsibility of directing the entire athletic department, including coaching the football and baseball teams and introducing basketball to the university. At Notre Dame, he served as athletic director from 1898 to 1900 and coached football from 1896 to 1898, basketball from 1897, and baseball from 1897 to 1899. He has earned the title of “Father of Notre Dame Football” for his success in expanding the program from an intramural activity to a full-fledged intercollegiate sport.\nTommy Mills helmed the team to a 57–20–1 record from 1927 to 1929, good for a .737 winning percentage.\nIn 1934, Clarence 'Jake' Kline became the school's 15th coach for 42 seasons. He retired in 1975 at the age of 81, coaching more than 1,000 games and winning 558. He led the team to the College World Series in 1957. He was voted into the College Baseball Hall of Fame in 1968. The former Cartier Field was renamed Jake Kline Field in 1975.\nIn 1980, Tom Kelly set the University of Notre Dame's record for wins (29–8). He remained an athletic administrator at Notre Dame until 2003.\nIn 1994, the Fighting Irish moved into its state of the art, 2,500 seat Frank Eck Stadium. Moving to Notre Dame in 1995, Paul Mainieri turned the Fighting Irish into a perennial postseason contender winning the Big East tournament a record 5 straight seasons, making the NCAA tournament 9 out of 12 seasons, and leading the Irish to one College World Series appearance in 2002. He won the 2001 and 2002 Big East Coach of the Year award. In total, Mainieri posted a .714 winning percentage going 533–213–3 in 12 seasons.\nEvansville's Dave Schrage then earned what he called his dream job, succeeding Mainieri as head coach at Notre Dame. Mik Aoki was named the team's 23rd head coach in team history in the summer of 2010. On June 8, 2019, Notre Dame announced that they would not renew Aoki's contract for the 2020 season.\nOn July 12, 2019, Link Jarrett was named the 24th coach in team history. He went 11 – 2 in his first thirteen games with the Fighting Irish, but the 2020 season was cut short due to COVID-19.\nDuring the 2021 season, Notre Dame finished with a record of 33–11 (25–10) (.755) and won the ACC Atlantic Division. Notre Dame was selected to host regionals for the first time since 2004. Michigan, UConn, and Central Michigan were all placed in the South Bend regional with Notre Dame. The Irish won the regional with a final record of 3–0. On June 5, 2021; the Irish beat UCONN in their 2nd round regional game by a score of 26–3. It was the record for the most runs scored during a playoff game in program history. The Irish advanced to the Starkville Super Regional, where they lost to eventual national champion Mississippi State.\nFacilities.\nFrank Eck Baseball Stadium.\n\"Also see: Frank Eck Stadium\"\nFrank Eck Baseball Stadium, known by fans as “The Eck”, is the home baseball stadium for the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish baseball team. Eck Stadium is located on the southeast corner of Notre Dame's campus in Notre Dame, Indiana. Opened in 1994, Eck Stadium is 14,211-square feet, has a capacity of 2,500, and cost $5.7 million to build. The stadium has become a favorite among the Irish baseball team, and a sampling of teams from the May 7, 2006, edition of Baseball America's top-25 poll showed that Notre Dame record-setting home attendance averaged ranked 11th-highest among those elite top-25 teams. Since its construction, the stadium has hosted two NCAA Regionals, 1999 and 2001.Plans to build the stadium were announced on June 7, 1991, stemming from a private donation gift to the university by alumnus Frank Eck, and his company, Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc., of Columbus, Ohio. His contribution to Notre Dame have totaled more than $35 million, including a $21 million gift in 2005 for the Eck Hall of Law, which is the fifth-largest gift in Notre Dame's history. Construction on the stadium finished in Spring 1994, and the first game was played on March 17, 1994, with a 5–8 loss against the University of Tennessee.\nEck Stadium includes spacious home and visitor locker-rooms, meeting rooms, and coaching facilities. Additionally, the stadium includes a spacious press box, located directly above home plate, which seats 25 staff and media members and has a panoramic view of Eck Stadium and other Notre Dame athletic facilities. At the 1995 Notre Dame alumni game, the university named Eck Stadium's playing surface Jake Kline Field to honor the program's winningest coach.\nThe Eck Stadium has undergone several renovations and additions, with plans to expand in the future. In January 2000, a 9,000-square foot indoor hitting and pitching facility, located adjacent to the left-field line, was added to enable year-round practice. In 2012, this facility got a major facelift, including a wall-to-wall synthetic turf floor, four full- and two half-batting cages, permanent pitching mounds within the tunnels, and an “Iron Mike” pitching machine with an automatic ball feeder. This space is primarily used for pitching, hitting, and catching, while the team uses the Loftus Center for defensive fundamentals and base running.  Additionally, the playing surface of the Jake Kline field received an upgrade before the 2014 season. The surface transitioned from natural grass to the artificial surface FieldTurf, which covers the entire field.\nThe Coach Pat Murphy Locker Room.\nThe Coach Pat Murphy Locker Room was added after the 2010 season. The locker room is located within Notre Dame's Frank Eck Baseball Stadium and was included in the first major renovation endeavor since the stadium's construction in 1994. It was made possible through private donations from Daniel Murphy, David Murphy, Bert Bondi (‘67), Craig Counsell (‘92), and John Counsell (‘64), as well as the support of Notre Dame baseball.\nThe Coach Pat Murphy Rocker Room was designed to make the team space more efficient and improve circulation between the clubhouse, shower, restroom facilities, and the dugout. A kitchenette and mudroom were added along with direct access to and from the dugout area. The space includes 36, 30-inch wood lockers, including four specifically designed corner lockers for the catchers. New flatscreen, high definition televisions and state of the art RightView Pro technology were installed as well.\nCartier Athletic Field.\n\"Also see: Cartier Field\"\nThe Cartier Field was a stadium in Notre Dame, Indiana which existed from 1900 to 1962. The field is named after Warren Antoine Cartier, who purchase 10 acres and donated it to the university for athletic purposes and paid for the lumber required to enclose the field. Notre Dame decided the field should serve the needs of a variety of athletic endeavors such as bicycling, track, baseball, and football. The finished grounds contained a baseball diamond, two football fields, a quarter-mile banked track, a 220-yard straightway and grandstand setting for 500. On May 12, 1900, the formal opening of Cartier Athletic Field featured a track and field championship tournament followed by a baseball game.\nThe field hosted the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team from 1900 to 1928. For more than 20 years after the football team moved out, Cartier Field remained the home of Notre Dame's baseball and track and field teams. The field was re-established in 1962, and the baseball team began to practice nearby in the Jack Kline Field.\nNotre Dame baseball during World War II.\nDespite dropping attendance at Notre Dame during the Second World War, baseball still thrived under coach Jake Kline. Over 200 men regularly showed up for tryouts during the years 1943–1945. The Fighting Irish baseball program benefitted from the presence of the Naval cadet program which contributed valuable team members. Because many schools were not able to field teams during the war years, the 1943 schedule only included eight games against universities located near Notre Dame. In 1944 and 1945, Coach Kline scheduled games against both universities and collegiate aged military teams such as the Iowa Pre-Flight School team and the Great Lakes Naval Training Center team coached by Mickey Cochrane. Major leaguers that played for Notre Dame during the Second World War included John McHale and Jackie Mayo. Notre Dame football players and Heisman Trophy winners Angelo Bertelli and Johnny Lujack suited up for the Irish during 1943 and 1944, respectively. Notre Dame's strongest team from the three years of America's involvement in the war was the 1945 squad that went 10–8–1. The 1946 squad benefitted from the return of many veterans, many of whom, such as 1944 team captain Tom Sheehan, had played for Notre Dame previously before joining the military. The 1946 team posted a record of 13–6 followed by a 16–5 record in 1947.\nNotre Dame Baseball Records During WW2"

        "text": "The 2011–12 Nemzeti Bajnokság I was the sixty-first edition of the top level championship in the Hungarian team handball for women. The regular season began on 4 September 2011 and concluded on 31 March 2011, followed by the classification rounds and the playoff finals.\nDefending champions Győri Audi ETO KC won the regular season with a perfect performance and easily absolved their semi-finals matches as well, and marched into the finals where they met FTC-Rail Cargo Hungaria, which overcame Siófok KC-Galerius Fürdő with a double victory. In the closest final of the recent years, ETO eventually managed to retain their league title: they won the first leg of the finals to 37–33, coming back from 6 goals behind, while in the second leg the teams went head to head till the dying minutes, when by a one-goal ETO lead, with no time left on the clock, Ferencváros was awarded a penalty. Jelena Živković stepped to the 7 meters line with the chance to equalize the match and save it for penalty shootouts. However, retiring goalkeeper Katalin Pálinger, who played her last match in Győr saved the penalty shot and ETO celebrated their fifth championship in a row and ninth overall.\nOverview.\nTeams.\nA total of twelve teams will compete in the league, including eleven clubs that participated in the past season's championship, joined by freshly promoted Kiskunhalas NKSE. Although officially bottom two teams get relegated and replaced by the Eastern and Western group winners of the second division, Mohácsi TE expressed that they have no desire to advance to the top division mostly for financial reasons. Therefore, following the decision of the Hungarian Handball Federation, eleventh placed UKSE Szekszárd could maintain its Nemzeti Bajnokság I membership. Twelfth placed Újbuda TC could not avoid relegation, after recorded only one victory during the whole season. Newcomers Kiskunhalas debuted in the Nemzeti Bajnokság I in 2004 and achieved their best result during the 2005–2006 season, when they finished sixth. In 2010 they suffered a level drop, but climbed back to the Nemzeti Bajnokság I immediately.\nLeague winners Győri Audi ETO KC also entered the EHF Champions League in the group phase, while runners-up DVSC-Fórum began their European adventure in the qualifying stage of the competition. 2011 bronze medalists FTC-Rail Cargo Hungaria entered the EHF Cup Winners' Cup as title holders, having defeated CB Mar Alicante in the previous year's finals to 57–52. Since both 2010–2011 Hungarian cup finalists qualified for the EHF Champions League via their league position, the spot reserved for the Magyar Kupa winners was passed to cup third Alcoa FKC RightPhone, which joined Ferencvárosi TC in the EHF Cup Winners' Cup. Fourth placed Váci NKSE, that reached the quarterfinals of the EHF Cup in the past season, had the chance to repeat their good run, while Budapest Bank-Békéscsabai ENKSE, which made an early exit in the 2010–11 EHF Cup, got the opportunity to improve their European balance this time.\nSponsorship changes.\nPrevious season's semifinalist Vác announced yet during the summer break, that they have split with their main sponsor SYMA, which could not guarantee the financial background they did earlier and eventually stepped down. As a result, the team have lost some of their key players and entered the season with a number of youngsters promoted from the second team, competing under their old name Váci NKSE. Meanwhile, DVSC agreed on a deal with the local mall center Fórum Debrecen, which became the club's new main sponsor, altering its name to DVSC-Fórum. In addition, on the same day they have signed a media contract with regional television Alföld TV, and under the terms of the agreement all of their matches will be live broadcast by the television station.\nPostseason.\nClassification round 9–12.\nTeams finished in bottom four places after the regular season entered a classification round, in which a double round-robin system was use. According to their final position in the regular season, these four teams were awarded bonus points. Ninth placed Békéscsaba got four points, tenth placed Dunaújváros were awarded three, eleventh placed Kiskunhalas got two points and finally last placed Szekszárd received one point.\nTable.\nAdditional points that were awarded after the final positions in the regular season are indicated in bonus points column.\nClassification round 5–8.\nTeams finished between fifth and eight place also played a classification round.

        "text": "The 2011 Survivor Series was the 25th annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by WWE. It took place on November 20, 2011, at Madison Square Garden in New York City. It was also the first one to take place in Madison Square Garden since the 2002 event, as well as the first Survivor Series held following the end of the first brand extension in August.\nSeven matches were contested at the event, six of which were broadcast live on pay-per-view. The main events from this installment of Survivor Series pay-per-view would have a lasting effect on the next year in the WWE. In the main event, The Rock, in his first WWE in-ring match since March 2004, teamed up with his WrestleMania XXVIII opponent John Cena to defeat The Miz and R-Truth. A predominant match saw Big Show defeat World Heavyweight Champion Mark Henry by disqualification. In another predominant match on the card, CM Punk was victorious over Alberto Del Rio by submission to win the WWE Championship, a reign that would continue until January 27, 2013 and become the sixth longest in the company's history.\nThe event garnered 281,000 pay-per-view buys, up from 244,000 buys the previous year's event.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV), produced every November by WWE since 1987—in April 2011, the promotion ceased going by its full name of World Wrestling Entertainment, with \"WWE\" becoming an orphaned initialism. The second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, referred to as the \"Big Four\". The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. The 2011 event was the 25th event in the Survivor Series chronology and was scheduled to be held on November 20, 2011, at Madison Square Garden in New York City. It was also the first Survivor Series held since the end of the first brand split in August. Tickets sold out in only 90 minutes.\nThe 2011 event was hyped in New York City by a huge fan interaction event outside of Madison Square Garden two days before the event, which included the first look at the new \"WWE '12\" video game, a signing with CM Punk, and a performance from the band Oleander. The event was attended by over 16,000 WWE fans, including one who received two tickets to the sold out event by The Rock. Also in attendance were Zack Ryder and Jimmy Hart, who gave a bus tour of New York to 150 fans who won tickets via WWE.com in the weeks leading to the event.\nStorylines.\nSurvivor Series featured professional wrestling matches involving different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines that developed on WWE's television programs, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\". Wrestlers portrayed heroes or villains as they followed a series of events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\nThe main event involved WrestleMania XXVIII opponents John Cena and The Rock teaming against the Awesome Truth (The Miz and R-Truth). After losing to Alberto Del Rio the previous month at Vengeance due to interference by The Miz and R-Truth. Cena decided to face both of them with Zack Ryder as his partner, but Miz and R-Truth ambushed Ryder before the match, in which they beat Cena down. Former Interim General Manager John Laurinaitis booked Cena with a match against Miz and Truth at Survivor Series with a partner of his choice, with Cena choosing his WrestleMania XXVIII opponent, The Rock, as his partner. Billed as the most charismatic team of all time, The Rock accepted his offer the following week.\nThree months prior at SummerSlam, Alberto Del Rio cashed in his Money in the Bank contract against WWE Champion CM Punk to win the title. Punk got a rematch at Hell in a Cell but it was a Triple Threat match and John Cena was the champion going into the match. Punk requested to have another one-on-one rematch for the championship. Del Rio objected but accepted the challenge after Punk locked him into an Anaconda Vise.\nThe event also included World Heavyweight Champion Mark Henry defending his title against Big Show. The two had wrestled each other the previous month at Vengeance, but during the match the ring had collapsed, leaving both men unable to continue. A rematch was scheduled for Survivor Series, with a reinforced ring being set up.\nA Survivor Series elimination match pitting Team Orton, consisting of Randy Orton, Sheamus, Sin Cara, Mason Ryan, and Kofi Kingston, against Team Barrett, consisting of Wade Barrett, Cody Rhodes, Dolph Ziggler, Jack Swagger, and Hunico, was also scheduled for the event. Christian was originally part of Team Barrett, but was pulled from the team after suffering an ankle injury during WWE's European Tour.\nEvent.\nPreliminary matches.\nIn the first match, Dolph Ziggler defended the United States Championship against John Morrison Ziggler performed a Zig Zag on Morrison to retain the title. After the match, Zack Ryder attacked Ziggler.\nNext, Beth Phoenix defeated Eve Torres in a Lumberjill match to retain the Divas championship. Phoenix won by pinning Eve after a Glam Slam from the top rope.\nIn the third match, Team Barrett (Wade Barrett, Cody Rhodes, Hunico, Jack Swagger, and Dolph Ziggler) faced Team Orton (Randy Orton, Sheamus, Kofi Kingston, Mason Ryan, and Sin Cara). Ziggler was the first man eliminated after an RKO. Sin Cara was eliminated after sustaining a legitimate injury. Ryan was then eliminated after Cross Rhodes by Rhodes. Kingston was eliminated by Wasteland by Barrett. Sheamus was disqualified after not breaking the referee's 5 count near the ropes. In frustration, Sheamus Brogue Kicked Swagger, who was then pinned by Orton. Hunico was next eliminated after Orton executed a RKO in mid-air on him. Following a distraction by Rhodes, Orton was pinned by Barrett, giving Team Barrett the win and leaving Rhodes and Barrett as the survivors.\nNext, Mark Henry defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Big Show. During the match, Henry tackled Big Show through the barricade, but Big Show got into the ring before the 10-count. Big Show then performed a diving elbow drop to Henry. Big Show then attempted his finisher, the WMD but Henry performed a low blow to Big Show, causing a disqualification. After the match Big Show placed a steel chair over the leg of Henry and gave him a leg drop onto the chair.\nIn the penultimate match, Alberto Del Rio defended the WWE Championship against CM Punk. Howard Finkel was the special ring announcer for Punk. During the match, there were many reversals and counters to the two men's various finishers and submission holds. The match resulted in Punk winning via submission with Del Rio submitting to the Anaconda Vice. Punk celebrated with the crowd after the match. This would be the start of Punk's reign that would last for 434 days.\nMain event.\nThe main event saw John Cena and The Rock face The Miz and R-Truth. Throughout the match, Cena was targeted and was almost pinned many times. After R-Truth and John Cena took each other out of the match, The Rock performed a spinebuster followed by the People's Elbow to pin the Miz. After the match, The Rock performed the Rock Bottom on Cena.\nReception.\nDave Meltzer wrote that the main event had \"The biggest big match feel in WWE since the John Cena vs CM Punk encounter from Money in the Bank earlier that year\". The event was released December 20, 2011, on DVD by WWE Home Video, and went on to be the highest selling pay-per-view on DVD that year behind Wrestlemania."

        "text": "The West Virginia Mountaineers baseball team is the varsity intercollegiate baseball program of West Virginia University, located in Morgantown, West Virginia, United States. The program has been a member of the NCAA Division I Big 12 Conference since the start of the 2013 season. The program currently plays at Monongalia County Ballpark in the adjacent city of Granville. Randy Mazey has been the team's head coach since prior to the 2013 season. As of the end of the 2023 season, the program has appeared in 14 NCAA tournaments. It has won five conference tournament championships and 16 regular season conference and division titles.\nHistory.\nThe program began varsity play in 1892 and had an above-.500 winning percentage in each season until 1920, when the team had a 10–11 record. It adopted the nickname \"Mountaineers\" in 1905, when West Virginia instituted the state motto \"Mountaineers are always free.\"\nAfter discontinuing the program for three seasons (1943–1945) because of World War II, the program began again prior to the 1946 season and qualified for its first NCAA tournament in 1955 under head coach Steve Harrick.\nOn-campus venue Hawley Field opened in 1971 and was used for all home games until after the 2012 season, as the field did not meet the standards of the Big 12 Conference, to which West Virginia moved in summer 2012. It remained in use for non-conference home games through the 2014 season, after which the team's current venue, Monongalia County Ballpark, opened.\nAs a member of the Southern Conference from 1951 to 1968, the team appeared in six NCAA tournaments. As a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference from 1978 to 1995, the team appeared in four NCAA tournaments. However, as a member of the Big East Conference from 1995 to 2012, the team appeared in only one NCAA tournament.\nStadium.\nMonongalia County Ballpark.\nIn 2013, plans were announced to build the program a new Morgantown venue. Ground was broken for the new ballpark at University Town Centre, an off-campus shopping and entertainment complex in nearby Granville, on October 17, 2013. The ballpark will be a fan friendly design with 2,500 fixed seats with additional hillside and club seating, a fan amenity deck, and a park that will be open year-round. The field will be a synthetic surface, other than the clay pitcher's mound. Also using the new ballpark will be the class-A short-season affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates, the West Virginia Black Bears. The stadium, tentatively known as Monongalia County Ballpark, is set to open for the 2015 season.\nHead coaches.\nThe program's most successful coach is former head coach Dale Ramsburg, who had 540 career victories from 1968 to 1994. Ramsburg is also the program's longest tenured head coach, having led the program for 27 seasons.\nYearly record.\nBelow is a table of the program's yearly records.\nNotable former players.\nMountaineers in Major League Baseball.\nBelow is a list of notable former players of the program and the seasons in which they played for the Mountaineers."

        "text": "The IFSC Climbing World Championships are the biennial (i.e. held once every two years) world championship event for competition climbing that is organized by the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC). This event determines the male and female world champions in the three disciplines of competition climbing: competition lead climbing, competition bouldering, and competition speed climbing. Since 2012, a combined ranking is also determined, for climbers competing in all disciplines, and additional medals are awarded based on that ranking. The first event was organized in Frankfurt in 1991.\nHistory.\nCreation and organizers.\nIn 1991, the \"Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme\" (UIAA) organized the competition climbing championships. The International Council for Competition Climbing (ICC) was created in 1997 as an internal body of the UIAA to take charge of competition climbing.\nIn 2007, the independent IFSC was created as a continuation of the ICC to govern competition climbing.\nEvents.\nThe present format has four disciplines: lead, speed, bouldering, and combined.\nThe first championships had two events: lead and speed. Bouldering was added in 2001.\nIn 2012, 2014 and 2016, a combined ranking (sometimes also called overall ranking) was computed for climbers participating in all of the three events. In 2018, a specific combined event was included which the six climbers with highest overall ranking were invited to enter. The combined event requires athletes to compete in all three disciplines, and they receive a single combined score based on all three results. Scores achieved in single-discipline events are not relevant to the combined score, and there are no awards for any one part of the combined event. The 2018 combined event tested the new Olympic Games format, which was used at the first appearance of climbing at the Olympics in 2020. In 2019 the Combined competition was held again with the best eight men's and women's athletes receiving invitations to the 2020 Olympics. \nParaclimbing was introduced at the 2012 World Championships, but in 2019 it became its own championship, the IFSC Paraclimbing World Championships.\nYears.\nThe World Championships are held every two years. Twice, the cycle has been moved to the other year and in those cases this was done by holding the next championship one year earlier. In 2012 the World Championships were shifted to even years to avoid interference with the 2013 World Games climbing event and to give a supplementary opportunity to demonstrate the sport for a possible integration into the 2020 Olympic Games. In 2019 the World Championships were again held one year early, to now allow the Championships to be the year before each Olympics to operate as a qualifier event.\nMedals.\nAs of 2023 IFSC Climbing World Championships (excluding paraclimbing medals)\nNote 1: share medals in 2007 IFSC Climbing World Championships\nNote 2: one silver medal in 2021 IFSC Climbing World Championships for Climbing Federation of Russia"

        "text": "John Robert Gamble Jr. (February 10, 1948 – September 1, 2022) was an American professional baseball shortstop who played thirteen games for the Detroit Tigers in two seasons of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1972 to 1973. He batted and threw right handed and served primarily as a pinch runner.\nGamble was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1966 and played for the team's minor league affiliates until 1970, when he was acquired by the Detroit Tigers via the Rule 5 draft. The Tigers promoted him to the major leagues two years later. Although he was noted for his base stealing skills during his time in the farm system, and was added to the major league roster to bring speed into the lineup, he ultimately did not attempt a stolen base. He played his last game on May 25, 1973, but carried on playing three more seasons in the minor leagues. He subsequently returned to his home state of Nevada and worked for a local county park and as a high school coach.\nEarly life.\nGamble was born in Reno, Nevada, on February 10, 1948. He was the first of three sons of John Sr. and Muriel Gamble, both of whom worked as teachers. His father also served as superintendent of public education in Nevada from 1966 to 1978.\nGamble attended Carson High School in nearby Carson City, Nevada, where he starred in basketball and football in addition to baseball. He posted batting averages of .479 and .420 during his junior and senior years, respectively, which caught the attention of scouts and led to him being offered a baseball scholarship by the University of the Pacific.\nProfessional career.\nLos Angeles Dodgers farm system.\nGamble was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the second round of the 1966 Major League Baseball draft. In June 1966, he signed with the Dodgers and received a bonus that was reported as the second highest paid to that date to a baseball prospect from Nevada.\nGamble played seven seasons in the Dodgers' farm system from 1966 to 1972. He distinguished himself with his base stealing prowess, stealing a total of 169 bases from 1968 to 1971. He tallied a career-high 60 stolen bases in 1970 for Daytona Beach. In 1970, he led the Florida State League in both stolen bases (66) and runs scored (91). On defense, he showed a talent for turning the double play (50 in 1968, 56 in 1969), but led the Florida State League's shortstops with 76 errors in 1968.\nDetroit Tigers.\nGamble was eventually acquired by the Detroit Tigers in the 1970 Rule 5 draft. He spent the 1971 season with the Tigers' Double-A Montgomery Rebels, appearing in 137 games with a .252 batting average. In 1972, he was promoted to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens, appearing in 128 games with a .268 batting average.\nIn September 1972, Gamble was called up by the Tigers. He made his MLB debut for the franchise on September 7, 1972, at the age of 24, entering as a pinch hitter and popping out in foul territory during his only plate appearance in a 9–0 loss against the Baltimore Orioles. In his next four appearances, he was utilized only as a pinch runner. He then had two plate appearances in the final game he played that season on October 4, but went hitless and did not reach base. He also played seven innings at shortstop during that same game, his first and only major league appearance at defense. Although manager Billy Martin reportedly wanted Gamble to replace the injured Ed Brinkman for the 1972 postseason, he was not added to the playoff roster.\nAfter spring training in 1973, Gamble returned to the Toledo Mud Hens. However, he was called up in mid-May 1973. At the time, manager Billy Martin complained about the lack of speed on the Tigers roster and noted: \"[W]e definitely need some good baserunning. That's one thing Gamble can do – he can steal a base.\" Gamble played his first major league game of the 1973 season on May 16. After entering as a pinch runner in extra innings, he scored the winning run on a walk-off sacrifice fly by Mickey Stanley in what turned out to be the only run he would score in his major league career. He played in six more games – all as a pinch runner – before being sent back down to the minor leagues at the end of May and undergoing season-ending knee surgery shortly thereafter. Gamble played his final major league game on May 25, 1973, at the age of 25. Although he played 11 of his 13 major league games solely as a pinch runner, he did not attempt a stolen base. He continued playing in the minor leagues until retiring at the end of the 1976 season.\nGamble played for the Evansville Triplets from 1974 to 1976, shifting from utility infielder to third baseman. In 1975, he compiled a .288 batting average and stole 13 bases while leading Evansville to a pennant and the Junior World Series. He was released by the Tigers in the spring of 1977.\nPersonal life.\nGamble married Dawn Carter in 1969. Together, they had two children: Cory and Tawnya. They eventually divorced. After retiring from professional baseball, Gamble worked for Washoe County Parks until 2005. He also coached high school baseball and softball in his hometown.\nGamble died on September 1, 2022, while dove hunting with his family in Orovada, Nevada. He was 74, and had a cardiac event prior to his death."

        "title": "North American Lacrosse League",
        "text": "The North American Lacrosse League (NALL) was a professional indoor lacrosse league based in the United States. It was founded in 2011 as North America's fourth professional lacrosse league, after American Lacrosse League (field lacrosse, 1987) Major League Lacrosse (a field lacrosse league) and the National Lacrosse League (the established professional indoor lacrosse organization). However, a rift in the organization led to the departure of four of the five teams to form the Professional Lacrosse League. After playing only one \"full\" season that was plagued with canceled games, a franchise folding, and players not showing up for games, the leagues folded.\nHistory.\nThe league was announced in May 2011. According to \"Sports Business Journal\", the league once sought to become an official developmental league for the established National Lacrosse League, but the plan was rejected. Like the NLL but unlike other lacrosse leagues that play in the summer, the NALL originally intended to start play in January. The league announced it did not intend to compete with the NLL, but would serve alternate markets where the NLL had no presence. By December 2011 five franchises had been announced for the inaugural 2012 season: the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Shamrocks, the Charlotte Copperheads, the Jacksonville Bullies, the Kentucky Stickhorses, and the Hershey Haymakers.\nHowever, weeks before the season was to start a rift split the league over leadership and scheduling. One faction comprising four of the five announced teams – Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, Jacksonville, Charlotte, and Hershey – announced that the NALL had relieved acting Commissioner Anthony Caruso of duty and would be switching from a winter to a fall schedule. Caruso responded that his removal was not legitimate, asserting that the Hershey franchise had already been suspended for failure to secure a venue, and that Wilkes-Barre/Scranton owner Jim Jennings was no longer managing partner of that franchise. Caruso claimed that he represented the true NALL, which then consisted of the Kentucky Stickhorses, other members of the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton ownership group (eventually named the Lehigh Valley Flying Dutchmen), and a recently announced 2013 expansion franchise in Boston (which Caruso claimed would be ready to compete in 2012 and considered a voting member).\nBoth camps considered themselves the legitimate North American Lacrosse League. The fall group planned on starting play in September and claimed to have a television deal lined up. The winter group played an abbreviated schedule featuring matches against non-league teams beginning in January 2012. It controlled the NALL website and issued a restraining order against the other camp. The dispute was settled in litigation; as a result the winter faction retained the NALL name and branding, while the fall faction formed the Professional Lacrosse League, scheduled to begin play in September 2012.\nOn March 8, 2013, it was officially reported the Baltimore Bombers had folded. General manager and head coach, Hunter Francis noted that \"...the economics didn't work.\" This news initially broke on \"Laxdirt.com\" and later on their Facebook page. Just two days before, the Bombers posted about giveaway at the game scheduled for March 10.\nThe 2013 league championship was viewable via internet pay-per-view for the cost of $2.95 at \"northamericanlacrosseleague.com/live\"\nOne June 18, 2013 the Kentucky Stickhorses posted on their Facebook a message from their owner, Anthony Chase, stating the NALL had suspended operations due to the Baltimore, Boston, and Rhode Island franchises not being able to continue operations due to \"financial constraints.\" The messaged also stated that the Stickhorses had two options: \"Join another 'startup' league or suspend operations as well. It is with deep regret, that I have to choose the latter.\"\nTeams.\n†-Teams left NALL to form PLL\nReferences.\n American Lacrosse League, 1987 Executive Director"

However, injuries plagued Harrington's season, and he would only play 32 games collectively for the Maple Leafs and their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Toronto Marlies.\nColumbus Blue Jackets.\nOn June 25, 2016, shortly after the conclusion of the 2016 NHL Entry Draft, Harrington was traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets (alongside a conditional fifth-round draft pick) in exchange for forward Kerby Rychel. The condition of the fifth-round pick would have been satisfied if Harrington was placed on waivers and claimed during the 2016–17 season, which did not occur.\nDuring the 2017–18 season, Harrington earned consistent playing time after Ryan Murray was injured, resulting in his playing 24 consecutive games. As a result, he also set a career-high with two goals and three assists for five points while also averaging 13:24 per game. Prior to the start of the 2018–19 season, Harrington suffered an upper body injury in a preseason game on September 28 and missed the Blue Jackets first two regular season games. Upon returning to the lineup, Harrington set new career highs in assists and points with two goals and 15 assists for 17 points in a career-high 73 games. He also helped the Blue Jackets advance past the first round of the postseason for the first time in franchise history by recording four assists through 10 playoffs games.\nHarrington was a consistent healthy scratch during the 2019–20 season, sitting out 22 of 30 games by December. However, as a result of injuries to the Blue Jackets lineup, he suited up for 39 of the team's 70 regular-season games. Harrington finished the regular season with one goal and seven assists for eight points.\nSan Jose Sharks.\nAfter six seasons within the Blue Jackets organization, Harrington left as a free agent and went un-signed over the summer. On September 9, 2022, Harrington agreed to join the training camp of the San Jose Sharks on a professional tryout. During the pre-season, Harrington successfully completed his tryout in earning a one-year, two-way contract with the Sharks on September 30.\nAnaheim Ducks.\nOn February 26, 2023, Harrington was traded to the New Jersey Devils in a multi-player trade, which involved Timo Meier. However, Harrington was waived by New Jersey one day later, and was subsequently claimed by the Anaheim Ducks on February 28.\nRemaining unsigned through the following summer, on August 23, 2023, the Ducks signed Harrington to a professional tryout (PTO) contract. After attending training camp, Harrington was re-assigned to continue his tryout with the Ducks AHL affiliate, the San Diego Gulls. On October 13, he was signed by the Gulls to a PTO contract to open the 2023–24 season.\nZSC Lions.\nBefore making an appearance with the Gulls, Harrington was released from his tryout on October 14, 2023, and then signed a one-year contract abroad with Swiss club, ZSC Lions of the National League (NL), on October 17.\nInternational play.\nHarrington was named as one of Canada's alternate captains for the 2013 World Junior Championships."

In the 1982 NHL Entry Draft, Karlsson was drafted in the 8th round, 162nd overall, by the New York Rangers. He left Kiruna AIF after the 1980–81 season, playing nine games with the team in the then second-tier league Division 1.\nThe following season Karlsson played in Sweden's national under-18 team in the 1982 IIHF European U18 Championship, scoring two points in five games and winning a gold medal. Karlsson also played in Sweden's national under-20 team in the 1983 respectively 1984 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. In the 1982–83 season, Karlsson was given the chance to play in Modo Hockey of the Elitserien, Sweden's top ice hockey league. During his first two seasons with the team he did not manage to score any goals, and in the 1983–84 season the team was relegated to Division 1. However, Karlsson and Modo were quickly promoted back to Elitserien the following season.\nAfter the 1985–86 season Karlsson left Modo to play in VIK Västerås HK, who at that time played in the Division 1. In his first season with the team, the 1987–88 season, the team was promoted to Elitserien for the first time in the club's history. Karlsson continued on to play for the team for another four seasons before finishing his player career in the Division 1 team Huddinge IK in the 1995–96 season.\nPost-career.\nIn 2003, seven years after his retirement, Karlsson was named the head coach of IF Björklöven, who at that time played in HockeyAllsvenskan. He coached the team for two seasons: in the 2003–04 season the team was forced to play in the Spring series but managed to stay in HockeyAllsvenskan, but in the 2004–05 season the team managed to reach the former SuperAllsvenskan but failed to reach the playoffs for a chance to play in the Kvalserien qualification for Elitserien. The following season Karlsson was named the general manager of IF Björklöven, but he left the club mid-way through the 2006–07 season and instead signed as the head coach for the Division 1 team Mörrums IK.\nPrior to the 2007–08 season Karlsson was named the head coach of the Växjö Lakers Hockey, who at that time played in HockeyAllsvenskan. Janne Karlsson managed to coach his team to a playoff spot in his first season with the team, but the team was quickly eliminated by VIK Västerås HK in three games. Then, in 2009, 2010 and 2011 he managed to coach his team to the Kvalserien qualification for Elitserien. The team was not lucky in the first two Kvalserien qualifications, but in the 2011 Kvalserien qualification he successfully coached his team to a spot in the Elitserien."

In later years, clubs from Serbia joined the league and in one season club from Italy participated in the league.\nHistory.\nThe league was established in 2008 as the \"Adriatic Water Polo League\" and the inaugural 2008–09 season consisted of clubs from Croatia, Montenegro and Slovenia. Members of the inaugural season were Jug, Mladost, Primorje, POŠK, Jadran Split, Medveščak Zagreb, Šibenik, Mornar, Jadran, Primorac, Budva, and Koper.

The incident was condemned by Croatian and Serbian public, and by many organizations and officials as well. Following the incident, the Water Polo Federation of Serbia and Serbian clubs in competition sought to not play any further games in Split, and competition's Board of Directors made a decision to postpone any further games in Split in which Serbian clubs are included.\nStarting with the 2020–21 season, the league is played in different format due to the COVID-19 pandemic, having two groups (2020–21 season with host cities being Belgrade and Dubrovnik, and 2021–22 season with host cities Belgrade and Split) and final tournament (2020–21 host being Zagreb, and 2021–22 host being Belgrade); In 2020–21 season, the Serbian club Radnički eventually won their first championship, thus ending 8-year dominance of the Croatian clubs.

He cited increased knowledge of the bidding process and the enthusiasm of residents as reasons to keep trying. According to a survey by \"The Chosun Ilbo\" on December 23, 2009, 91.4% of Koreans, 93.4% of Pyeongchang and Jeongseon residents, and 93% of Gangwon residents supported the 2018 Winter Olympics bid. Cho Yang-ho, Chairman of Hanjin Group, was appointed as the bid committee chairman in 2009, and successfully won the bid in 2011. South Korea's figure skating superstar and 2010 Olympic champion Kim Yuna and IOC member and Samsung Group chairman Lee Kun-hee promoted the bid.\nThe Samsung Chairman and principal owner Lee Kun-hee, given a 3-year suspended sentence for tax evasion and illegal bond dealing, was reportedly pardoned by the South Korean president Lee Myung-bak with the hope that his connections and financial support would boost the chances of Pyeongchang.\nOn February 16, 2011, the IOC Evaluation Commission arrived in Korea for inspection of Pyeongchang’s bid. \"We have seen great progress in the bid from the two previous bids,\" commission chairwoman Gunilla Lindberg said. \"We have also seen progress in Korean winter sports during the last four years.\" Speaking at the IOC news conference following the inspection of Pyeongchang and venues in Gangwon Province, Lindberg said \"I must also mention the passionate support of Gangwon residents. During our site visits it has been wonderful to see so many people to show their support to bring the Olympic Movement to Korea.\"\nSeven venues had been built since the previous bids, including ski jumping slopes, and biathlon and cross-country skiing courses. Pyeongchang would be a compact Olympic Games, with travel times of less than 30 minutes between the main accommodation in Alpensia resort and the venues and 10 minutes between venues. A new 250 km per hour KTX line will be built between Seoul and Wonju via Pyeongchang putting Pyeongchang within 50 minutes of Seoul.\nGerman reporter Dietmar Gessner from \"Sport Bild\" said that \"in Asia including Korea you can create more customers. You can make lots of money for winter sports..\"\nPyeongchang’s slogan is “New Horizons.” The bid's logo suggests the winter scenery of Pyeongchang with snow on the mountains. The curve implies a will to win and symbolizes a snowboard and slope of winter sports."

Munich's bid head was figure skating superstar Katarina Witt, replacing skiing star/filmmaker/entrepreneur Willy Bogner, Jr. who had to step down due to health reasons.\nMunich stressed an environmental approach and would have used existing venues in Munich (some from the 1972 Games), and existing venues in the Bavarian mountain resorts of Garmisch-Partenkirchen (location of the 1936 Winter Olympics) and Schönau am Königssee, an hour away by car. Fifteen competition venues were proposed – eight exist, three would have required construction and four would have been temporary. To take environmental responsibility, new venue construction would be on existing sites in order to minimize land use. Ice events would have been held in Munich in addition to the existing Olympic Stadium for ceremonies. The Olympic swimming pool would have been adapted into a curling venue, figure skating and short track would have been at Olympic hall, a hockey arena would have been on the site of the old cycling stadium, and a second ice hockey arena and a speed skating oval would have been dismantled and used elsewhere after the Games. Garmisch-Partenkirchen Snow Park would have housed nine snow venues, Both locations would have had Olympic villages. In the district of Berchtesgadener Land, located in close proximity of the border to Salzburg, Austria, the historic Koenigssee Sliding Center was renovated for the World Championships in 2011 for hosting bobsleigh, luge and skeleton.\nThe Green Party and several ecological associations opposed the bid. Arguments included the lack of natural snow, the environmental costs of artificial snow, using green land for temporary sites, road construction projects that would have caused a lasting increase of transit traffic, the financial risk, and the imposition of unnegotiable clauses by the IOC. As these points received increasing attention, public support for the bid diminished. While a 2009 poll gave 75.5% support of Munich residents and 68% across Germany, in spring 2010 these numbers were down to 69% and 64%, respectively. The bid proved highly divisive in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, where more than 50 farmers refused to allow the use of their grounds. Before, similar refusal of farmers to cooperate had forced the planners to abandon Oberammergau as site of the Nordic competitions. As a replacement, a state-owned stud near Ohlstadt was chosen, which is located 200 meters lower than Oberammergau and more often than not is snow free in February.\nOn February 22, 2011, land owners in Garmisch-Partenkirchen supporting the 'Nolympia' initiative began collecting signatures under efforts to force a vote to decide whether the town would back the bid. \"The Olympic Winter Games are too big for Garmisch-Partenkirchen. With more than fifty events in the snow cluster there are almost five times as many events as the world ski championships,\" said Nolympia backer Axel Doering. \"Our goal is to win a referendum, so that the contracts be reviewed. Another goal is to finally show that the alleged \"huge majority\" [of support] for the Olympic Winter Games is a myth,\" he added. Munich's bid plans called for the leasing of land from private land owners for the Games. The then-German Olympic committee President Thomas Bach said complaints by landowners in Garmisch-Partenkirchen were not a problem for the bid. \"It's not a problem at all because for the field of play, it's one piece of land with 800 square meters. The piece of land was there for the alpine world championships six weeks before,\" said Bach. He added \"we have seen this at the world championships they were all going down on this very slope and they will go down in 2018, hopefully.\"\nOn February 28, 2011 the IOC evaluation commission traveled to Munich and to the other cities, in which competitions would be held. The 1972 Olympic Stadium in Garmisch-Partenkirchen was the high point of the IOC's tour. IOC Evaluation Commission chair Gunilla Lindberg said her inspection team had \"absolutely felt the atmosphere and passion\" for the Olympics at the end of its four-day inspection of the Munich bid. \"The general impression is that it is a strong bid with strong governmental support. It is a good team on the bid committee and Germany is a big winter sports country used to organizing competitions.\" The then-IOC vice-president Thomas Bach insisted that 2018 was a good time for the IOC and Olympic Movement to bring the Games to the traditional winter sports city of Munich to \"recharge the batteries after having been to new regions, with 2014 to Sochi and 2016 to Rio\". German chancellor Angela Merkel said Munich had a \"very good chance\" of winning the race to host the 2018 Winter Olympics. She added, \"The world can look forward to Germany hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games 2018.\"\nIn addition to its historical strength as a passionate winter sports nation, figure skating superstar Katarina Witt promoted the bid, as well as 2010 Winter Olympics star alpine skier Maria Riesch and Olympic champion Bavarian biathlete Magdalena Neuner.\nWithin the IOC, Munich had a strong ally with IOC vice president Thomas Bach, whom, it was thought, could swing the vote to Munich, even though the 2014 Games will have been held in Europe as well. Nevertheless, Munich was already considering a bid for 2022 even before the 2018 bid failed.\nOrganizers budgeted US$42 million for the bid and US$331 million for venues with $143 million budgeted for an ice hockey arena. $743 million was allotted for new and planned transportation improvements.\nThe slogan of the Games was \"Die Spiele im Herzen\" (The games at heart) and it was also being tagged as \"the friendly Games\". The logo was a stylized M, reminiscent of the Bavarian mountain silhouettes as well as the awnings in Munich's Olympic Park."

        "title": "Annecy bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "Annecy 2018 ( or ) was an unsuccessful bid by Annecy, France, for the 2018 Winter Olympics. \nOverview.\nAt first, the French Olympic Committee (CNOSF) was quite reluctant in bidding for a Winter Games, preferring to focus on a bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics. However, four cities (Annecy, Grenoble, Nice and Pelvoux) expressed interest in hosting the 2018 games. On September 24, 2008, the Olympic Committee announced it had granted these wishes and would bid in 2011. Annecy was elected as the official candidate city by the French NOC on March 18, 2009. The CNOSF acknowledged its tough competition, but intended to learn from the failure of Paris to secure the Summer Olympics recently with victory in Annecy, maintaining a humble approach.\nPrevious bid head Edgar Grospiron, Olympic skiing champion, stated, \"we have exceptional, spectacular scenery with Mount Blanc, economic strength with one million tourists every year, and so we believe that our bid is credible. We want to invite the world to a party in a world famous resort\". Grospiron was being assisted by IOC members and former Olympians Jean-Claude Killy and Guy Drut. However, his demission on December 12, 2010 raised questions on the viability of the bid. On January 10, 2011, Charles Beigbeder was named as the new CEO for the Annecy bid. In addition, Olympic champions Jean-Pierre Vidal and Pernilla Wiberg were appointed as Vice Presidents of the bid. Beigbeder said he would seek more financial support for the bid from the private sector. Also announced with Beigbeder's appointment was the selection of Pierre Mirabaud as Director General of the bid. Mirabaud had been a regional government prefect, experience which Beigbeder said was needed by the bid.\nOn February 12, 2011, the IOC evaluation commission completed its four-day inspection of the Annecy bid. During a brief press conference, commission chair Gunilla Lindberg was cautious in her praise of Annecy. On a positive note, she told reporters: \"We have during our visit witnessed very strong governmental support which the bid enjoys and this was highlighted by the presence of the President Sarkozy and many members of his cabinet throughout the visit. I think the bid committee of Annecy has listened to the comments made by the IOC [criticism of the spread-out venues in June] and there has been a big improvement, especially not having so many competition venues as was proposed.\" But there was no glowing assessment of the Annecy bid from Lindberg. The Swedish IOC member also gave no clue about any concerns that had arisen during the inspection team's four-day stay in the French Alpine town.\nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy also travelled to Annecy to meet with the IOC Evaluation Commission inspecting the city's bid for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games. \"The government will do everything possible, you can be sure, so that Annecy, applicant for the 2018 Winter Olympics, will be chosen,\" Sarkozy said. \"Annecy's victory will be the victory of the entire nation, standing behind you.\" While pledging his support for the bid he said \"you are trying hard. It's difficult. Your opponents are extremely powerful but I'm with you. If we win the Games it will be fantastic. And if we don't win, all we did will be useful for your cities and your region\".\nThe territory that was proposed to host the Games is concentrated in Annecy and Mont Blanc where 65% of the venues were already built and \"the world's leading winter sports destination\". In a reference to difficult snow conditions at the 2010 Winter Olympics, organizers made a guarantee of snow in Pays de Savoie where the average snowfall in February is 80 cm. Annecy is a smaller city, so the whole department of Haute-Savoie would have been used, including world-famous ski resorts like Chamonix, Megève, La Clusaz, Morzine and Le Grand Bornand. Spread over an area with a 50 km radius, everything is within an hour of Annecy, and two Olympic villages were planned., Of the 13 venues, six venues would have required permanent upgrades, two new venues were already planned to be built, and four other venues would have been built if the Games were hosted in Annecy. Sliding events would have been at La Plagne, the same facilities that were used for the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville and which were upgraded in 2008.\nHowever, in June 2010, the IOC criticized Annecy's bid stating that the competition venues were excessively dispersed. The IOC report was highly critical over the original venue plan, saying it would \"present major operational and financial challenges\" that would \"affect the Games experience for all client groups, particularly athletes\". On October 4, 2010 Annecy's leaders unveiled a new \"ultra-compact\" venue concept in response to the IOC concerns. Under the reworked venue plans, all ice and snow events would take place within a 21-mile radius at two main bases, Annecy and Chamonix, which are less than an hour apart and linked by motorway and the \"Games Train\". All alpine skiing would take place in Chamonix, which would also host ice hockey. All freestyle skiing and snowboard were centered on Annecy. Curling was relocated to Annecy, the hub of most ice sports, meaning that the Olympic Village would have been a little bigger than previously, to accommodate 2,500 athletes and officials. The revised bid moved the second Olympic Village (1,500 beds) from the Mont Blanc valley into the center of Chamonix.\nOn March 28, 2011, the CAO (Annecy Anti-Olympic Committee) stated that it wanted to tell people about what \"not only the excesses of the Olympics, the sport business, the financial stakes of multinationals and unacceptable demands of the IOC, but also on adverse impacts on the environment and on uncontrolled public spending with long-term debt for the Olympic city\". The group said it had collected 13,140 names for its petition opposing plans to bring the Winter Olympics to Annecy. In a press release issued on the 28th, the opposition group cited information reported exclusively by media outlet Around the Rings that an IOC poll showed only 51 percent of the local population supports the Annecy candidacy.\nBid costs were US$ 21 million. Venue construction was set for $419 million and transport/infrastructure costs (including some already planned and some dependent on the Games) was $2.1 billion. Among the transport costs were a new high-capacity gondola connection between Flaine and Mont-Blanc, and a train link. The nearest airport service would have been in Lyon and Geneva (35 minutes by car).Public support for the bid was 88% across France and 81% in the Annecy region.\nAnnecy's logo featured the French Alps, specifically Mont Blanc, as well as suggesting the letter \"A\" for Annecy.\nVenues.\nAnnecy Cluster\nAnnecy Olympic Stadium – Opening and Closing Ceremonies \nMont Blanc – Ski Jumping, Alpine Skiing, Nordic Combined, Cross Country Skiing \nPatinoire Jean Régis – Speed Skating \nLe Grand Bornand – Biathlon \nChamonix Cluster\nPiste de Bobsleigh des Pellerins – Bobsleigh, Luge and Skeleton\nStade Olympique de Chamonix – Curling, Ice Hockey\nAftermath.\nSix years after Annecy's defeat in the race for the 2018 Olympics, Paris won the right to host the 2024 Summer Olympics. The 2024 Olympics will be the first Olympics to be held in France since Albertville hosted the 1992 Winter Olympics."

The Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, based in northern Japan, and coached by Senichi Hoshino, were particularly affected by the quake, as the Miyagi Baseball Stadium was badly damaged. \nBecause of energy concerns following the earthquake, NPB also imposed restrictions on games during the regular season. A three-hour-thirty-minute rule was imposed. If a game went past the 3:30 mark, regardless of inning, the inning in question would be the last inning. A game would be called should any blackout occur during the game. The 3:30 clock starts at the first pitch of the game and continues in case of any delay.\nAt the season's end, the Yokohama BayStars was renamed as Yokohama DeNA BayStars as the owner changes.\nClimax Series.\n\"Note: All of the games that are played in the first two rounds of the Climax Series are held at the higher seed's home stadium. The team with the higher regular-season standing also advances if the round ends in a tie.\"\nFirst stage.\n\"The regular season league champions, the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks (PL) and the Chunichi Dragons (CL), received byes to the championship round.\"\nFinal stage.\n\"The regular season league champions, the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks (PL) and the Chunichi Dragons (CL), received a one-game advantage.\""

        "text": "Richard Lee James (born October 11, 1947) is an American former professional baseball player. A , right-handed pitcher, James was the Chicago Cubs' first #1 draft pick in the inaugural Major League Baseball Draft of June 1965. Selected after his graduation from Coffee High School, Florence, Alabama, James had a six-season (1965–1970) professional career, but his Major League stay was only three games and innings pitched — a proverbial \"cup of coffee\" — at the tail end of the season.\nJames was the sixth player selected in the first round of the first MLB Draft, following #1 overall choice Rick Monday (taken by the Kansas City Athletics), #3 overall Joe Coleman (Washington Senators), and just ahead of #7 pick Ray Fosse (Cleveland Indians); Baseball Hall of Fame catcher Johnny Bench was taken in the second round, 36th overall, by the Cincinnati Reds.\nJames was called up by the Cubs after a successful 1967 season split between the Double-A and Triple-A levels of minor league baseball. His first two appearances came in relief against the eventual 1967 world champion St. Louis Cardinals and the National League runners-up, the San Francisco Giants. James held them scoreless over innings. But in his third game, this time as a starting pitcher against the Reds on the closing day of the season at Crosley Field, James lasted only three innings and was roughed up for seven earned runs and nine hits, including a home run (by Vada Pinson) and three doubles, and he was charged with the loss in a 10–3 Cincinnati triumph.\nIn 1968, James returned to the minors, and was selected by the San Diego Padres in the expansion draft following the 1968 season. James pitched through the 1970 season before leaving baseball at age 23."

        "title": "Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team",
        "text": "The Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team is the women's wheelchair basketball side that represents Australia in international competitions. The team is known as the Gliders. The team hasn't won a gold medal for Australia since it began competing at the 1992 Summer Paralympics, however it has won either the silver or bronze medal since the 2000 Summer Paralympics held in Sydney. Gliders finished 6th at the 2014 Women's World Wheelchair Basketball Championship but did not qualify for the 2016 Summer Paralympics.\nHistory.\nWomen's wheelchair basketball was first played at the 1968 Summer Paralympics in Tel Aviv, but Australia did not have a team that competed until 1992 in Barcelona.\nThe 1996 Summer Paralympics were the first Paralympics basketball tournament to feature the three-wheeled wheelchair. Most of the women on the Australian team opted to use the traditional four-wheeled wheelchair.\nCompetition history.\nPrior to the start of the 1996 Paralympics, Australia was ranked third in the world after their bronze medal at the 1994 Wheelchair Basketball World Championship, behind first placed Canada and United States. In lead up preparations for the games, the team toured Canada. Australia's women's team beat the American team at the Paralympics in pool play. This was viewed as extremely significant by Australian women's wheelchair basketball fans and the Australian Paralympic Federation because the game was invented in America. Also, it was the first time that the Australian women had defeated the Americans. The match had even more significance because Australia needed to win it in order to stay in contention for a medal. Australia was down 21–16 at halftime. Australia went up with seven minutes left in the second half. The match finished with a score of 31–27 in Australia's favour. American Sharon Herbst was their team's start performer and she caused a number of problems for Australia's defence. During the game, several players were knocked out of their wheelchairs, including Australia's Melissa Ferrett. The Americans challenged the win, protesting because they believed the Australians were not wearing matching uniforms. Australia beat Brazil 67–8, beat the USA 31–27 and lost to Germany 34–26 in pool play. They lost to Canada in the semi-finals, going down 31–36. They played the Americans in the bronze medal match, losing 30–41. The team's top scorer in the competition was Liesl Tesch.\nIn 1998, the team again won a bronze medal at the World Championships. In April and May 1999, the team was invited by the Kinki Wheelchair Basketball Association and the Japanese Wheelchair Basketball Federation to compete in a tournament in Japan to celebrate twenty-five years of wheelchair basketball in that country. The Australian team won every game they competed in, including three test matches against the Japanese team. The last test was played before Japan's royalty, and Australia won 61–25. The team had an official team dinner with Emperor Akihito of Japan during this tour.\nThe team won silver medals at the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney and the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens, with a bronze medal at the 2002 World Championships. Prior to the start of the 2008 Paralympics, the team was ranked fourth in the world. They received this rank by beating Japan and New Zealand in the qualifying tournament for the games.\nIn 2008, the team competed in the Osaka Cup. They earned a silver medal, only losing to the United States in the final. The Gliders lost to the United States 20–52. After the Osaka Cup, the team competed in the Goodluck Beijing Test Event, where they won three matches and lost one against China. The team then competed in the Joseph F. Lyttle World Basketball Challenge, where they finished third. They then went to the United States and competed in the North America Cup, where they finished fourth. The team then went back to China where they played five matches against China, where they went undefeated.\nThe Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team at the 2012 Summer Paralympics consisted of twelve included nine veterans with 15 Paralympic Games between them: Bridie Kean, Amanda Carter, Sarah Stewart, Tina McKenzie, Kylie Gauci, Katie Hill, Cobi Crispin, Clare Nott and Shelley Chaplin; and three newcomers: Amber Merritt, Sarah Vinci and Leanne Del Toso. The Gliders, who had won silver in the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney and the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens, but had never won gold, finished at the top of their pool in the group stage of the competition with victories over Brazil, Great Britain and the Netherlands. They then went on to win in the quarter-final against Mexico and the semi-final against the United States, only to lose to Germany in the final.\nPast Paralympic Games rosters.\n2016 Paralympic Games.\nGliders failed to qualify after finishing second to China at the 2015 Asia Oceania Zone Qualifying Tournament.\n2020 Paralympic Games.\nDetailed Results – Wheelchair basketball at the 2020 Summer Paralympics\n2024 Paralympic Games.\nGliders failed to qualify after losing to Japan in the quarter-finals at the IWBF Repechage in Osaka, Japan."

        "text": "The 1991 season of the Philippine Basketball League (PBL).\nNew teams.\nTwo new teams join the league, they are the Triple-V Saisaki Restaurant Group and RC Cola. Burger City takes a conference-leave while Philips Sardines transfer its franchise to A&amp;W Rootbears.\nMaharlika Cup.\nThe season opens on February 9. After the double-round eliminations, Magnolia defeated Swift, 80–76, in a playoff game on March 27 for the sixth and last semifinals berth.\nCrispa 400 and Cebu's Mama's Love, in their second finals appearance since 1985, played in the championship. The Crispa 400s wins their 2nd PBL title in a 3–1 series victory. After losing Game One, 78–91, the 400s came back to take the next three games and clinch the crown. In a riotous second game which Crispa won, 99–95, the Powder Makers rallied from 21 points down to within two points with 24 seconds left but a bad call from the referee prompted fans from Cebu-based squad to react furiously and started pelting the court and in the process halting play for nearly 20 minutes.\nCrispa coach William \"Bogs\" Adornado, who took over the coaching position from Fortunato \"Atoy\" Co at the start of the season, won his first title as a mentor. Among his players are Johnny Abarrientos, Victor Pablo, Felix Duhig, Saturnino Garrido, Alejandro Lim, Kevin Ramas, Maximo Delantes, Roberto Jabar, Gil Lumberio, Victor Villarias and Edward Joseph Feihl.\nMama's Love's Stevenson Solomon emerged as the league's leading rebounder and was adjudged Most Valuable Player.\nChallenge Cup.\nThe import-laced tournament reeled off on May 18 at the Loyola Center in Katipunan Avenue, Quezon City, under new PBL Commissioner Atty. Gregorio \"Ogie\" Narvasa. The respective teams' imports were Mark Anthony Tillmon of Crispa 400s, who played for the Utah Jazz in the NBA, another NBA veteran Trent Jackson of Sta.Lucia, played one month for the Milwaukee Bucks in 1989, Hollman Harley of Mama's Love, Joey Johnson of Triple-V, Patrick Thompkins of Swift Hotdogs, Johnny Bell of the returning Burger Machine (formerly Burger City), Dominique Stephens of RC Cola, Melvin Reid of A&amp;W Hamburger, and Richard Morgan of Magnolia Ice Cream.\nImports defections hurt the tournament, first to leave was Crispa's Mark Tillmon, who was replaced by Perry Bromwell, then Triple-V's Joey Johnson, who was replaced by Tyrone Pitts. Swift's Patrick Thompkins left the Hotdogs before a playoff with Burger Machine for a semifinal berth. Swift later pick a 6-3 Fil-American guard Mateo Caimol, reportedly a two-time MVP for an NCAA Division III school Erskine College of South Carolina, as his replacement. Sta.Lucia's Trent Jackson led the Realtors to a playoff for the second finals berth against Triple-V but decided to leave before the game and the Realtors lost to the Foodmasters, 81–88.\nTriple-V in only their second conference, joined the ranks of champions by beating the Crispa 400s in the best-of-five finals series, 3 games to 1. The Foodmasters won Game One, behind import Tyrone Pitts, who scored 34 points as against Crispa's Perry Bromwell's only 10 points. In Game Two, Triple-V took a commanding 2–0 lead with a 106–98 victory behind once again on the explosive performance of Pitts, scoring 41 points. Crispa's proud legacy gave them a victory in the third game and avoided a possible sweep. In the title-clinching Game Four, regulation ended at 78-all, and in the extension period with the rule first-to-score seven points, the Foodmasters scored seven points first to win, 85–78, and in the process wrapped up its first championship. Triple-V coach Derrick Pumaren led his second PBL team to a title after numerous championships with Magnolia, the Triple-V roster includes Verne Villarias, Allen Sasan, Jolly Escobar, Arthur Ayson, Ronald Cahanding, Dwight Lago and Django Rivera."

After a straight red card, FIFA would conduct a hearing and could extend this ban beyond one match. If the ban extended beyond the end of the finals (i.e. if a player was sent off in the match in which his team was eliminated), it had to be served in the team's next competitive international match(es).\nFair Play Award.\nThe Fair Play Award was given to the team with the best overall discipline throughout the tournament. Teams were given a certain number of points—15 in the first stage, 5 in the quarter-finals, and 10 points for the remaining four teams—from which points were deducted depending on the infraction. The team that advanced past the first stage with the most points was awarded the trophy. Teams that dropped below zero points were excluded from winning the award.\nThe four semi-finalists (Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela) were the only teams considered for the Fair Play Award. After a post-match brawl in the semi-finals, Paraguay and Venezuela were excluded from winning the award. Peru and Uruguay finished the tournament with the same number of points. Since Uruguay had fewer players handed a red card during the tournament, they won the Fair Play Award."

        "text": "In baseball statistics, a relief pitcher is credited with a save (denoted by SV) who finishes a game for the winning team under certain prescribed circumstances. Most commonly a pitcher earns a save by entering in the ninth inning of a game in which his team is winning by three or fewer runs and finishing the game by pitching one inning without losing the lead.\nMariano Rivera is the all-time leader in saves with 652. Rivera and Trevor Hoffman are the only pitchers in MLB history to save more than 600 career games. Lee Smith, Francisco Rodríguez, Kenley Jansen, John Franco, Craig Kimbrel, and Billy Wagner are the only other pitchers to save more than 400 games in their careers."

        "text": "Jack Tracy Martin (August 15, 1922 – October 1, 2015) was an American basketball coach. Martin coached the Lamar Cardinals for 25 seasons in both the Lone Star Conference and the Southland Conference. Jack was a brigadier general in the Texas Air National Guard, and held a top security defense rating. He served in the Pacific throughout World War II, and was a veteran of more than 35 years in the Air Force.\nPersonal life.\nMartin was born on August 15, 1922, in Desdemona, Texas, to Ernest William and Betty Myers Martin. He was raised in Burkett, Texas with his sister Lois. Following graduation from Burkett High School in 1937, he attended John Tarleton Agricultural College in Stephenville, Texas, on a basketball scholarship, participated in the ROTC program and majored in petroleum engineering. After graduation, Jack enlisted in US Army Air Corps, September, 1942; 16 months later was commissioned 2nd Lt. Martin served with distinction in the Pacific Theater during WWII, and at 22 one of the youngest B-29 pilots in the Theater.\nAfter discharge from Ft. Sam Houston in 1946, with numerous scholarship offers, Martin chose Hardin-Simmons Baptist University, Abilene, Texas. While at Hardin-Simmons Baptist University met freshman cheerleader, Shirley Stephens, three months later, 27 June 1947, they were married. Their daughter, Sharon, arrived one year later. Martin graduated from HSU in 1948 with a Bachelor of Science degree in physical education and Mathematics. At HSU, he was an All-Conference guard for two years and captain of the basketball team in his senior year. In 1948 he was appointed, at age 25, he was appointed as HSU's youngest basketball coach. Martin earned a Master of Science Degree in education and mathematics in 1951 from HSU. After three successful coaching seasons, he accepted Head Basketball position at Lamar University, Beaumont, Texas, coaching there 25 years. At the conclusion of his coaching career, he became the director of placement at Lamar University, an administrative post he held 13 years until his retirement in 1990.\nIn 1948 Martin became a member of the Army National Guard in Abilene. After moving to Beaumont, the State of Texas appointed him the commander to organize the mid-country Air National Guard Squadron, Jefferson County Airport, Nederland, which became known for its efficiency and superb performances. He completed 35 years with Air Force and Texas Air National Guard.\nMartin served on the NCAA Rules’ Committee six years and was treasurer for two years. He received numerous honors for basketball achievement; the most prestigious being named to the Hardin-Simmons University Athletics Hall of Fame and the Lamar University Sports Hall of Honor. He was also named to the All Border Conference Team as an Outstanding Point Guard in 1946-47 and 1947-48. Some additional recognitions include Distinguished Alumni at HSU in 1982; Induction into the Hall of Leaders at HSU in 2008, the Builders’ Association of Sabine Area Distinguished Citizen Award; Beaumont YMCA Award for Outstanding Leadership and Service to the Community, Life Membership Award in the Southwest Placement Association; Honorary Member – Delta Sigma Pi Business Fraternity; and Sons of the Republic of Texas; and Order of Daedalians, Fraternity of Military Pilots. He is listed on the Tarleton State College Wall of Honor Memorial Monument as a General Officer who served with extraordinary distinction in positions of great responsibility and as a recipient of the Distinguished Service Medal. Among other medals he received were the Legion of Merit Medal, Air Medal, and WWll Heavy Bomber Pilot Medal. He was also a faithful member of First Baptist Church in Beaumont and helped establish the Recreation and Family Life Center at the church; and a member of the South Beaumont Lions Club.\nOn October 1, 2015, at the age of 93, Martin died in San Antonio, Texas.\nCoaching career.\nHardin Simmons.\nImmediately upon graduation from HSU in 1948, Martin was appointed head basketball coach. At age 25, he became one of the few to coach a senior-college team after never having coached in a high school or serving as an assistant, and was one of the nation's youngest coaches in a major senior college. He led the Cowboys for three seasons.\nLamar.\nJack Martin was the first and longest-serving head coach in Lamar's history. He came to Lamar after coaching three seasons at his alma mater Hardin-Simmons. Martin began coaching the Cardinals as they entered the college division Lone Star Conference in 1951. Martin coached Billy Tubbs from 1955 to 1957, Tubbs would later become the first player or student to return and coach Lamar Basketball. In 1964 Lamar began its transition into Division I and the Southland Conference. The highlight of Jack Martin's career would be his 1968–1969 squad that earned a #1 national ranking in the Associated Press college division poll. Martin's squad that year won its first 15 games of the season against very strong competition. \nThe Cardinals won their first game against Pepperdine 65–64 then traveled to Memphis and beat a strong Memphis State team, 82–69. A week later, they quieted a stunned crowd in College Station's G. Rollie White Coliseum by strumming Southwest Conference champion Texas A&amp;M, 98–87.\nWith the Cardinals sitting at 6–0 and sixth-ranked University of Tulsa coming to town, most observers figured the good times were at an end. Instead, they kept rolling as Martin's flashy Cards decked Tulsa, 103–77.\n\"Since we had gone 8–17 the previous season, what that team did to start that year has to be one of the greatest surprises ever in Lamar basketball, at least up until that point,\" said Joe Lee Smith, then LU's director of sports information. \"They beat a good Pepperdine team and an outstanding Memphis State team to get started, then they beat Texas A&amp;M on the road, which was totally unexpected.\n\"Tulsa was ranked No. 6, but we kicked the dog out of them. That triggered a lot of national attention. It was the first year for us to be fully Division I, and after that win we started getting a few votes in the major college polls.\"\nAfter the Cardinals held off Arkansas State 84–81 in Jonesboro to tie the school record of 12 straight wins, they rose to No. 18 in the United Press International major college poll. They were the only team ranked in both polls.\nA few nights later, the prominent Houston Cougars, who had been to the Final Four the previous season, came to McDonald Gym. Coach Guy Lewis' Cougars had never lost to Lamar, up until this point. With 8:15 left in the game, the Cardinals trailed 56–44, but they rallied to go ahead 61–59 in the final minute. The Cougars scored in the final seconds, however, and the teams went into overtime tied at 61.\nThe overflow throng in McDonald Gym and those viewing the game by closed-circuit television in a nearby dining hall erupted into bedlam when forward Jim Nicholson stole the ball and went in for a layup seconds after the overtime tip-off. Then, spindly guard Earl Dow popped in a corner jumper to give the Cards a four-point lead, and they controlled the rest of overtime, winning 71–65.\nOn a cold February 1 night in Abilene, the record streak reached 15 games with an 85–72 victory over Abilene Christian. Two nights later on \"The Stage\" in Arlington, it ended with a 76–71 loss to Texas-Arlington.\nMilitary career.\nActive duty.\nFollowing graduation from John Tarleton Agricultural College in Stephenville, Texas, on a basketball scholarship, Jack participated in the ROTC program and majored in petroleum engineering, Jack joined the US Army Air Corps on Sept. 5, 1942 and spent 16 months training as a pilot and instructor. He was commissioned on June 27, 1944, as a 2nd Lt. He served as a pilot for the 884th Bomb Squadron, 383rd Bomb Group in the United States and for the 435th Bomb Squadron, 333rd Bomb Group, 316th Bomb Wing in the Pacific Theater of Operations (Okinawa and Guam) when the bombs were dropped on Japan in August 1945. He flew B-24 and B-29 heavy bomber aircraft, had 700 flying hours and was in command of and responsible for the plane and crew while in flight. Following the surrender of the Japanese, he transferred to and also served as controller for the 305th Fighter Control Squadron, 301st Fighter wing, Okinawa and was responsible for fighter interception for the Air Defense Command with over 1000 flying hours of P-38 and P-47 fighter aircraft.\nWhen Japan surrendered unconditionally, ending the war in the South Pacific, large numbers of service men were left with little to do except wait for their return to the States. Martin decided to form a competition basketball team. He stated that it was great fun playing basketball and flying with those P-47 pilots even though he was called the “Throttle Jockey from Texas”! The 301st won the Championship of Okinawa Tournament and went on to win the South Pacific All-Service Championship which was in Rozalle Stadium, Manila, Capitol of the Philippine Islands on Southwest Luzon.\nNational Guard.\nAfter WWll, Jack continued serving his country by immediately joining the US Army National Guard in Abilene, Texas. He served with distinction as the Commander of a Field Artillery Battery. In June, 1956, at the request of the Texas Governor, Martin and 20 guardsmen started the 273rd GEEIA (Ground Electronics Engineering Installation Agency) Communications Texas Air National Guard Squadron where he served as Commander and in 1957 he obtained his BI/Top Secret Security Clearance designation and in 1969 he attended the National War College Defense Strategy Seminar and later the Command and General Staff School in Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas. Under his leadership, the squadron was known worldwide for the capabilities, initiative and professionalism in performance of both its state and federal missions including NATO Communications installations in Europe. In 1974, Martin completed the National Security Management Course from the Industrial College of the Armed Forces in Washington, D.C. After retiring from Commander of the 273rd Squadron in 1975, Col. Martin was promoted by the Governor of Texas to Brevet Brigadier General to serve in various assignments including representing the US Dept. of Defense in numerous foreign countries, Liaison for the Air Force Academy, and Civil Service Disaster Relief Operations Coordinator in Southeast Texas."

        "text": "Hector Felipe Santiago (born December 16, 1987) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Acereros de Monclova of the Mexican League. He has played in MLB for the Chicago White Sox from 2011 to 2013 and in 2018 and 2019, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim from 2014 to 2016, Minnesota Twins from 2016 to 2017, New York Mets in 2019, and Seattle Mariners in 2021. He plays for the Puerto Rico national baseball team.\nHe played one year of college baseball at Okaloosa-Walton Community College in Niceville, Florida. He was an All Star in 2015.\nAmateur career.\nSantiago graduated in 2006 from Bloomfield Tech High School in Essex County, New Jersey. He played one year at Okaloosa-Walton Community College (now Northwest Florida State College). He is of Puerto Rican descent.\nProfessional career.\nDraft and minor leagues.\nThe Chicago White Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB) drafted Santiago in the 30th round of the 2006 MLB Draft, and he signed with the team on May 30, 2007. He made his professional debut with the Rookie-level Bristol White Sox of the Appalachian League that summer, going 1–1 with a 1.65 ERA in 17 relief appearances. While playing for Bristol, Santiago also befriended Nate Jones, and the pair rose through the White Sox's farm system at the same pace.\nIn 2008, he played for the Single-A Kannapolis Intimidators, recording a 5-1 record and 4.06 ERA in 38 games. For the 2009 season, Santiago played for the High-A Winston-Salem Dash, pitching to a 4-4 record and 3.88 ERA with 66 strikeouts in 58.0 innings of work. He returned to Winston-Salem the following year, registering a 4-5 record and 4.15 ERA with 61 strikeouts in 60.2 innings pitched.\nFirst stint with the Chicago White Sox (2011–2013).\nSantiago, who split time with Winston-Salem and the Double-A Birmingham Barons in the first half of 2011, was called up to the majors for the first time on June 26, 2011.\nSantiago made his MLB debut on July 6, 2011, pitching a perfect ninth inning against the Kansas City Royals. He struck out Eric Hosmer for his first Major League strikeout. On April 7, 2012, Santiago earned his first career save by striking out Elvis Andrus to seal a 4–3 victory for the White Sox. On May 8, Santiago earned his first career win during a 5–3 victory over the Cleveland Indians, pitching one inning yielding two hits and striking out one. He remained the majority of the season in the bullpen while also starting on four occasions. He finished 4-1 in 42 games with 4 saves.\nIn 2013, Santiago split between the White Sox bullpen and the rotation, finishing with 23 starts while also appearing 11 times out of the bullpen. Although his ERA for the season was 3.56, his record was just 4-9 for the White Sox.\nLos Angeles Angels (2014–2016).\nSantiago was traded to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on December 10, 2013, in a three-team trade involving the Chicago White Sox, the Arizona Diamondbacks, and the Los Angeles Angels. The Angels received Tyler Skaggs along with Santiago, while the White Sox received Adam Eaton and the Diamondbacks received Mark Trumbo and two players to be named later. In his first season in Anaheim, Santiago was fairly inconsistent, he averaged less than 6 innings per start and for a moment was sent to the bullpen, where he made 6 appearances while also starting 24 times for the Angels. In 127.1 innings, Santiago went 6-9 with a 3.75 ERA.\nSantiago enjoyed his best season in 2015, setting career highs in wins, innings, strikeouts, and in WHIP. He had the lowest ground ball percentage among major league pitchers (29.9%), and the highest fly ball percentage (53.6%).\nSantiago began the 2016 season in the Angels rotation. From April to June, Santiago recorded a record of 4-4 with an ERA of 5.27. However, in the month of July, Santiago went on a roll for the Angels, allowing just 8 runs in 35.1 innings while posting a 6-0 record. His 2016 stats with Anaheim ended in 22 starts while going 10-4. He did however raise his walk total, issuing 57 walks in 120.2 innings.\nMinnesota Twins (2016–2017).\nOn August 1, 2016, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim traded Santiago along with Alan Busenitz to the Minnesota Twins in exchange for Ricky Nolasco, Alex Meyer, and cash. For the Twins in 2016, he was 3-6 with a 5.58 ERA. Pitching for the two teams, he had the lowest line drive percentage allowed (15.9%) of all major league pitchers, the highest fly ball percentage allowed (50.0%), and gave up the highest percentage of hard-hit balls (37.3%).\nHe spent much of the 2017 season on the disabled list, and finished with a 4-8 record and a 5.63 ERA. He elected free agency on November 2, 2017.\nSecond stint with the Chicago White Sox (2018).\nOn February 14, 2018, Santiago signed a minor-league deal with the Chicago White Sox. Santiago's contract was purchased by the White Sox on March 28, and he was assigned to the Opening Day roster. Santiago spent the majority of the season in the White Sox bullpen, logging a 4.41 ERA in 102.0 innings pitched across 49 appearances.\nNew York Mets (2019).\nOn January 5, 2019, Santiago signed a minor league deal with the New York Mets. He was assigned to the Triple-A Syracuse Mets to begin the season. Santiago was promoted to the major league club on May 20, following an injury to Seth Lugo. Santiago was designated for assignment on June 15 after struggling to a 6.75 ERA in 8 appearances. He elected free agency on June 18.\nThird stint with the Chicago White Sox (2019).\nAs a minor league free agent, Santiago signed a contract with the White Sox on June 21, 2019. He played seven games for Charlotte, going 1–4 with a 5.84 ERA in the process, before he was called up to Chicago on August 6, replacing an injured Manny Bañuelos. On September 24, Santiago struck out eight batters, the most by a White Sox reliever since Brandon McCarthy in 2005. Those strikeouts amounted to little, however, as the Cleveland Indians shut out Chicago 11–0, with Santiago allowing seven runs over four innings. In 11 major league games for the White Sox, Santiago went 0–1 with a 6.66 ERA, striking out 34 batters in innings.\nDetroit Tigers organization (2020).\nPrior to the 2020 MLB season, Santiago sent out a resume and cover letter to all 30 major league teams, in which he said that he would pitch in whatever position they needed, ending with a note that, \"I’ll be the yes man for whoever needs me to be. My career has literally been just like this— ha-ha.\" This caught the attention of the Detroit Tigers, who signed Santiago to a minor-league contract on January 22, 2020. The contract included an invitation to spring training, which placed him in competition with fellow left-handed relievers Tyler Alexander, Nick Ramirez, and Gregory Soto for a place in the Detroit bullpen. The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on both major and minor league baseball extended the Tigers' bullpen battle into July, and a number of extra relievers attended Comerica Park for the final round of roster cuts that July. Santiago was released from the organization on July 21, before playing a regular season game for the Tigers.\nSeattle Mariners (2021).\nSantiago's resume approach did not garner any more team offers for the remainder of the 2020 season, or in time for 2021 spring training, and he spent the winter playing for Puerto Rico in the 2021 Caribbean Series. On April 30, the Seattle Mariners called Santiago and asked if he could make a start for their Triple-A team, the Tacoma Rainiers, on May 8. He pitched four no-hit innings, striking out seven batters and walking two. On May 27, the Mariners selected his contract and promoted Santiago to the majors, where he was meant to bolster a bullpen that had been depleted by injury and COVID-19.\nOn June 27, Santiago became the first MLB player ejected from a game as part of new policies banning the controversial \"sticky stuff\" that pitchers used to enhance their grip. Both Santiago and Mariners manager Scott Servais argued that the substance found on Santiago's glove was a mixture of sweat and rosin, the latter of which was allowed. Santiago appealed the 10-game suspension, which was ultimately upheld, and he was suspended from July 15 to July 27. Only two days after returning from that suspension, Santiago was suspended for an additional 80 games without pay following a positive test for exogenous testosterone, considered by MLB to be a performance-enhancing drug. He told reporters that his doctor in Puerto Rico had suggested that he undergo hormonal replacement therapy for an undisclosed medical condition, but he did not contest the suspension. Santiago made 13 major league appearances in 2021, posting a 1-1 record and a 3.42 ERA while striking out 30 batters in innings.\nAcereros de Monclova (2023–present).\nOn November 30, 2022, Santiago signed with the Acereros de Monclova of the Mexican League for the 2023 season.\nInternational career.\nSantiago played for the Puerto Rican national team in the 2017 World Baseball Classic where he won a silver medal.\nPitching style.\nSantiago throws a wide variety of pitches, although by far his most common is a four-seam fastball in the range of 90–96 mph. His off-speed pitches include a curveball, a slider, a changeup and an occasional cutter. He is also one of the few pitchers in recent years to throw a screwball. Lefties tend to only see fastballs and curveballs, while right-handers see mostly fastballs, changeups, and screwballs.\nAccording to Santiago, \"I'm ... mostly on the inner half to right-handers and away to lefties. I try to get it down and in to righties and down and away to lefties, and let them basically get themselves out. How my ball moves is a big part of how I pitch.\""

        "text": "John W. Field (September 26, 1886 – May 3, 1979) was an American football player and coach. Field played college football for Yale University from 1908 to 1910 and was captain of Yale's football team. He also served as the head coach of the 1911 Yale football team. He later worked for more than 60 years as manufacturer of corsets and lingerie.\nEarly years.\nField was born in Viroqua, Wisconsin, in 1886. His father, Walter S. Field (born October 1856), was a Wisconsin native and an attorney. His mother, Emma (Tourjee) Field (born October 1858), was also a Wisconsin native. He moved with his family to Oklahoma as a boy. At the time of the 1900 United States Census, Field was living with his parents and three sisters (Eva, Ruth and Luella) in Washington, D.C.. His father was employed at that time as an attorney. Field attended high school at the local high school in Washington, D.C.\nYale.\nField enrolled at Yale University. He played for Yale's freshman football team in 1907 and then at the halfback and fullback positions for the Yale Bulldogs football team from to 1908 to 1910. During his three years as a player, the Yale football team compiled an overall record of 23–3–3, and has been recognized as national champions in 1909.\nAfter graduating from Yale in 1911, Field was hired to stay on at Yale as the head football coach. Field coached the 1911 Yale football team to a 7–2–1 record, outscoring opponents 191 to 16. Field continued to serve the Yale football team as an assistant coach in several subsequent seasons.\nDuring the period from 1899 to 1912, Yale had 14 different head football coaches in 14 years – despite compiling a combined record of 127–11–10 in those years. During that 14-year span, the Yale football team has also been recognized as the national championship team by one or more of the major national championship selectors on seven occasions – 1900 (Billingsley, Helms, Houlgate, National Championship Foundation, Parke Davis), 1901 (Parke Davis), 1902 (Parke Davis), 1905 (Parke Davis, Whitney), 1906 (Billingsley, Parke Davis, Whitney), 1907 (Billingsley, Helms, Houlgate, National Championship Foundation, Parke Davis, Whitney), and 1909 (Billingsley, Helms, Houlgate, National Championship Foundation, Parke Davis).\nBusiness career and family.\nField was married to Margaret Lucetta Warner (born October 15, 1891), the daughter of corset manufacturer, DeVer Warner.\nField began working in his father-in-law's corset manufacturing business in approximately 1910. In a draft registration card completed in June 1917, Field stated that he was living in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and working as the general superintendent of Warner Bros. Co.\nBy 1920, Field was the manager of the corset department of The Warner Brothers Company in Bridgeport. At the time of the 1920 United States Census, Field was living in Fairfield, Connecticut, with his wife, Margaret Warner Field and their three children – John W. Field (1914–2005), William Field (age 2-1/2), and Jean Field (age 6 months). They also had two live-in maids and one live-in cook. His occupation was listed as a manufacturer of corsets.\nIn December 1920, Field traveled to Europe to establish a branch of the business in Brussels, Belgium.\nAt the time of the 1930 United States Census, Field was living in Fairfield, Connecticut, with his wife Margaret Warner Field, their children, John W. Field and Jean Field, and three live-in servants. Field's occupation was listed as the president for a factory.\nField's father-in-law died in 1934, and Field took over as chief executive officer of The Warner Brothers Company. Under Field's leadership, the company revamped its product line with new products, including the \"Two-Way-One-Way\" girdle, \"an elastic undergarment that wrapped around the body and flattened the hips yet still allowed full body movement.\" In a draft registration card completed at the time of World War II, Field indicated that he was living with his wife at 1514 Hillside Road in Fairfield, Connecticut, and that he was employed by The Warner Brothers Company in Bridgeport.\nIn 1947, as the post-war economy boomed, the company's revenues topped $12 million with profits of $1 million. The company prospered through the 1950s with the Warner brand lines of bras, girdles, and \"corselettes.\" By 1956, sales had risen to more than $25 million. In 1957, Field's son, John Warner Field, persuaded the company's board of directors to oust his 73-year-old father, and the younger Field took over as chief executive officer.\nField remained active with the company as the chairman of its board of directors from 1957 to 1973. The company became publicly traded in 1961 and changed its name to Warnaco Inc. During the 1960s, the company acquired several other apparel companies, including the Hathaway, Lady Hathaway, Puritan and Thane brands. In 1968, the company achieved sales of $185 and profits of $77 million. The company evolved from a manufacturer of corsets and brassieres to a leading manufacturer of wide range lingerie, intimate apparel, and sports apparel. In 1969, the company also began to manufacture panty hose and stretch hosiery. When Field retired as chairman in 1973, his son, John W. Field, took over as chairman. His son, John W. Field, took over as the company's president in 1957 and continued to serve in that capacity until 1979. The company today is known as the Warnaco Group and is the producer of a wide range of intimate apparel, sportswear, and swimwear, including the brand names Calvin Klein, Speedo, Chaps, Warner's, and Olga.\nField's wife, Margaret Warner Field, died in November 1973 at their home on Hillside Road in Fairfield. Field died six years later in 1979 at a hospital in Fairfield, Connecticut."

In general, these followed the same format as those in the men's Giro d'Italia.\nThe leader of the General classification received a pink jersey. This classification was calculated by adding the combined finishing times of the riders from each stage, and the overall winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Giro.\nSecondly, the points classification awarded the maglia ciclamino, or mauve jersey. Points were awarded for placements at stage finishes as well as at selected intermediate sprint points on the route, and the jersey would be received by the rider with the most overall points to their name.\nIn addition to this, there was a mountains classification, which awarded a green jersey. Points were allocated for the first few riders over selected mountain passes on the route, with more difficult passes paying more points, and the jersey would be received by the rider with the most overall points to their name.\nFourth, there was the jersey for the Best Young Rider, which was granted to the highest-placed rider on the General classification aged 23 or under. This rider would receive a white jersey.\nFinally, there was the jersey for Best Italian Rider, awarded to the Italian rider placed highest in the general classification. This rider would receive a blue jersey.\nIn addition to the jerseys, an award was given for Best Team. This result was determined by adding the total times of each team's top three riders at the finish of each stage."

The first encounter was in 1973 when Australia ran up 59 points to 21, but the second was the closest ever, with Italy losing by a single point 16-17.

        "title": "Cricket in Austria",
        "text": "Cricket in Austria is a sport growing in popularity played mostly in Summer.\nHistory.\nHaving been played by the gardeners of rich aristocratic families at the end of the 19th century - at which time Vienna Cricket and Football Club was founded, cricket disappeared in Austria until after the Second World War, when it was played by British occupying troops on a recreational basis.\nThe modern era as such began in May 1975, when Kerry Tattersall introduced the game to his pupils at the commercial academy where he was teaching English and formed Vienna Cricket Club. Early opponents came from the United Nations (United Nations CC) and diplomatic services (Five Continents CC) and these founder clubs survive to this day.\nCricket remains predominantly Viennese-based with nine of the 13 member clubs being based in Vienna. CC Velden '91 is the oldest non-Viennese club, operating since 1991. The latest addition to the ACA is the Under-19 team Austrian Daredevils Cricket Club (ADCC) from Vienna.\nGrounds.\nUp to 1995, when Seebarn Cricket Ground was built close to Vienna, cricket had been played nomadically on multi-purpose sports grounds, often with a mat put down on a hockey or football ground.\nAfter Seebarn, three other cricket grounds have been constructed: one in Vienna, which is the home ground of Austria CC Wien, one in Velden, Carinthia, home of CC Velden '91, and one in Graz, home of Graz Cricket Academy.\nInternational competition.\nIn the past, Austria has hosted and participated in numerous ICC European competitions, having been instrumental in setting up the European Indoor Championships, and also hosting the ICC European Trophy twice - finishing second on both occasions.\nIn 2002, Austria played in the ICC European Championships for the first time, with a close loss to Gibraltar being its best performance.\nThey did not compete again until 2009, when they took part in European Championship Division Four in Cyprus. A decent performance was put up as it won four out of five matches, finishing below Cyprus and Switzerland only on net run-rate.\nDomestic competitions.\nCompetitive outdoor cricket matches have been organised by the ACA for more than 20 years in different formats, with the ACA Open League considered the premier tournament. The ACA Trophy, which had previously been a 40-overs-per-side tournament switched to a 20-over format in 2008.\nFurthermore, the Austrian clubs organise indoor and outdoor tournaments and friendly fixtures amongst themselves and against touring teams. There are 13 member clubs in the ACA, predominantly from Vienna.\nCricket Development.\nAustria CC Wien (Vienna) sets an example to the other clubs with its youth, women's and schools' cricket development programme, which has been masterminded by Siva Nadarajah, whose commitment to Austrian cricket over nearly 30 years has been second to none. Its junior teams play regularly against teams from neighboring countries and have been exceptionally successful in recent years.\nIn 2019, Graz Cricket Academy was formed, with the stated aim of growing the game in Austria at all levels; men, women and youth."

        "text": "Cricket has been played in The Bahamas since 1846.\nHistory of cricket.\nIt is the oldest sport being played in the country today. The only other sporting event that began before cricket was horse racing, which started in 1796. The Bahamas Cricket Association was formed in 1936 as an organised body. From the 1940s up to the 1970s, cricket was played by just about everyone on the island whether in the road, playground or on cricket fields. Had the Bahamas been part of the West Indies Board, a number of players from the island may have made the national team.\nThe late 1970s saw the game begin to decline in the country as teachers, who had previously come from the UK with a passion for cricket were replaced by teachers who had been trained in the United States. The Bahamian PE Teachers had no knowledge of the game and instead taught track &amp; field, baseball, softball among other sports. Scholarships abroad for other sports lured the youths away from cricket.\nInternational competition.\nThe Bahamas first appeared in international competition in 2002 when it entered the ICC Americas Championship. After predictably struggling amongst more established nations, it found its feet when the format was changed into three divisions from 2006. It eventually gained promotion to Division One via the 2010 Americas Division Two, a feat that has also earned it a place in the 2010 Pepsi ICC World Cricket League Division Eight.\nIn 2006, the Bahamas competed in the historical Stanford 20/20 Tournament in Antigua, where the side struggled to compete. An U19 squad competed in the ICC Americas U19 Tournament in Canada from August 11–19, 2007, a first for an Affiliate country in the Americas to participate at this level.\nDomestic competition.\nThe local league consists of seniors playing 20-overs competition with ten teams and runs from October to July. During the course of the season, other competitions are played as well, including six-a-side typically on holidays for entertainment. A major six a side match is sponsored by KFC during the labor day weekend. A junior league has been reformed to incorporate the youths of the nation. \nDevelopment programme.\nIn 2006, the Association took a bold step in hiring an international cricket coach from England to take the game into the schools. The coach was able to make contact with 26 primary schools in Nassau, seven in Grand Bahama and one in Bimini, where Kwik Cricket was introduced to the young boys and girls. A total of 13,600 kids are involved in that scheme. Out of that programme, the Association was able to start an U15 and U13 league with four teams in each competition, with the U15s playing with a hard ball. An U19 team was also developed with plans in place to sustain the game for years to come.\nThe national association recently installed three turf wickets at Haynes Oval, which is the main ground; it also has three artificial practice nets. Windsor Park, where the youths play, consists of an artificial pitch and lights around the ground.\nWomen's cricket.\nEven though there are already girls involved in the Kwik Cricket League, efforts and plans are being put in place to have a women's team in the future."

        "text": "Belfast Harlequins Ladies Rugby is a rugby union team based in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The team is part of the multi-sport organization, Belfast Harlequins.\nHistory.\nIn 2008, Belfast Harlequins RFC opened its doors to developing a ladies team within the rugby section. They approached ex-ulster ladies coach, Nathan Moore, in 2008, to coach the squad, and had an open day in May 2008 which attracted over 20 adult ladies.\nIn the initial ladies development plan, the first year of the club was to develop the players skills and seek occasional friendly games. However, with the influx of players into the club it was decided to go straight into All Ireland Division 2 North.\nInaugural season: 2008/2009.\nThe first season (2008/2009) was a hard fought one, with the Harlequins Ladies only winning 2 out of their season fixtures.\nInaugural season, 2009/2010.\nIn their second season (2009/2010) the adult squad grew to approximately 30 players and made a good account for themselves finishing mid table in A.I.L Division 2 North and competing in the Carrick 10's in May and entering a Tag team into the IRFU Tag leagues during the summer months.\nIn their third season (2010/2011) the recruitment drive in the Tag leagues and by the dedicated recruitment team saw the adult playing numbers rise to over 40+ and for the first time in Ulster rugby history the club was able to field two competitive teams, one in AIL Division 2 North and the Ulster Development League. Both teams entered the Ulster Provincial Cup, and the 1st XV entered the AIL cup. Again, both of the teams entered the Carrick 10’s tournament and both reached finals in the competition, the 2nd XV (named the Quins Barbarians) reached the bowl final, and the 1st XV reached the cup final and were winners of the Plate. At the end of the season the ladies qualified to the first All-Ireland 7s finals and came away winners of the Plate against a number of AIL 1 team. During the season the club also started development on a youth structure and have formed links with a number of schools in the Belfast area. In 2009/10 there were 6 youth players and in 2010/2011 this number grew to having 16 youth players between the ages of 12-17 years of age.\n7's Tournament.\nThe club hosts a 7's tournament every August inviting teams from around the United Kingdom to take part in a day-long competition. In its first year, eight teams took part with a Canadian touring side entering along with teams from Ireland. St. Mary's was the first-ever winners of the tournament in 2010."

        "text": "Nathan Massey (born ) is an English professional rugby league footballer who plays as a or for Featherstone Rovers in the RFL Championship.\nHe had previously played his entire professional club career with the Castleford Tigers (Heritage No. 876), and only former club captain Michael Shenton has made more appearances for the Tigers than him in the Super League era.\nEarly in his career, he spent time on loan or dual registration from Castleford at Featherstone Rovers, Gateshead Thunder, and York City Knights in the Championship, and at the Keighley Cougars and the York City Knights in League 1.\nBackground.\nMassey was born in Castleford, West Yorkshire, England.\nMassey played junior rugby league for Wakefield-based side Walton Warriors before being signed to the Castleford Tigers academy at the age of 15.\nPlaying career.\nCastleford Tigers.\nMassey progressed through the ranks at the Castleford Tigers academy and made his first team début on 11 March 2007 in an 88–10 victory over Castleford Lock Lane in the Challenge Cup. He was named the Tigers Academy player of the year in 2007.\nOn 24 March 2008, Massey made his Super League début for Castleford against the Warrington Wolves. In the 2008 season, Massey spent time on loan at Featherstone in the Championship and at York in League 1 to gain first team experience. He impressed for the Knights, who expressed a desire to extend his stay at the club into the next season. He was given an upgraded full-time contract by Castleford in August 2008.\nMassey spent time on loan at Gateshead Thunder alongside several Castleford teammates in 2009. In March 2010, he joined Keighley Cougars on a dual registration deal. Despite making an impressive debut, he suffered a severe shoulder injury against the Sheffield Eagles in his first game for the club, ending his season prematurely.\nMassey began the 2011 season playing for the York City Knights in the Championship through their dual registration arrangement with Castleford. He had been linked with a loan move to Harlequins but the Tigers preferred he went to York, from whom he could be recalled each week if needed. In his second spell with the club, he was voted the Player of the Month for February, and scored his first competitive try on 13 March against Hunslet. In June, the Knights decided against renewing Massey's temporary deal to free up salary cap space and instead develop their own players; he scored 2 tries against Rochdale in the Challenge Cup on his return to Castleford. Injuries to teammates afforded Massey an extended run in the Tigers' first team, and he made 15 appearances during the remainder of the season.\nHe played in the 2014 Challenge Cup Final defeat by the Leeds Rhinos at Wembley Stadium.\nHe played in the 2017 Super League Grand Final defeat by the Leeds Rhinos at Old Trafford.\nOn 30 April 2021, Massey made his 250th Castleford appearance. On 17 July 2021, he played for Castleford in their 2021 Challenge Cup Final loss against St Helens.\nMassey made his 300th Castleford appearance on 8 September 2023 in the Tigers' 29–12 victory over Hull FC.\nFeatherstone Rovers.\nOn 10 November 2023, it was announced that Massey had signed for Featherstone Rovers for the 2024 season. He had originally agreed terms while Featherstone were anticipating promotion to the Super League, but said he \"wanted to commit to the project even though we're still in the Championship\".\nInternational honours.\nOn 4 November 2007, Massey was named as one of ten s for the United States in a 70–0 warm-up game defeat by Cumbria at Barrow's stadium, Craven Park. He has later clarified that he has \"no allegiance to America\", with the experience coming about through U.S. team manager Mick Robinson being football manager at Castleford. He has had no involvement since, being ineligible under IRL rules."

        "text": "Li Yan (; born September 17, 1992) is a former professional snooker player from the People's Republic of China.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nLi received a wild card for the 2008 Shanghai Masters, losing 1–5 to Anthony Hamilton. At the 2009 Shanghai Masters, he defeated Gerard Greene 5–4, before losing to Ryan Day in the last 32.\n2011/2012 season.\nLi qualified for the 2011/2012 professional Main Tour as one of four semi-finalists from the second 2011 Q School event. As a new player on the tour Li would need to win four matches in order to reach the main stage of the ranking tournaments. He accomplished this in qualifying for the second biggest tournament on the snooker calendar, the UK Championship, with wins over Stuart Carrington, Andy Hicks, Jack Lisowski and Fergal O'Brien. He faced former world champion Shaun Murphy in the first round of the event and was beaten 3–6. He could not qualify for another tournament for the remainder of the season but did play in all 12 of the PTC events throughout the season reaching, but not progressing past, the last 16 on three occasions.\nLi finished the season ranked world number 67, just outside the top 64 who retain their places on the tour. However, due to being ranked 43rd on the PTC Order of Merit he secured one of the eight spots for the highest non-qualified players to play in the 2012/2013 season.\n2012/2013 season.\nLi only won two matches in ranking event qualifiers in the 2012/2013 season.&lt;ref name=\"2012/13\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His best results in the minor-ranking Players Tour Championship events were last 16 losses in the third Asian PTC and the fourth European Tour Event, to Stuart Bingham and Rory McLeod respectively. He lost seven consecutive games after this, before beating Robbie Williams 10–7 in the first round of World Championship Qualifying, but his season was ended when he lost 10–2 to Jimmy Robertson in the following round. Li dropped 17 places in the rankings during the year to finish it at world number 84.\n2013/2014 season.\nThe first ranking tournament Li could qualify for in the 2013/2014 season was the Indian Open by beating Peter Lines 4–2. He then edged out Jeff Cundy 4–3 to record his first ever win in the main draw of a ranking event, before being thrashed 4–0 by John Higgins.&lt;ref name=\"2013/14\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Li also qualified for the International Championship and World Open during the season, losing to compatriots Liang Wenbo and Ding Junhui in the first round. He won more than one match in an event for the only time this season in the World Championship qualifiers by defeating Elliot Slessor 10–5, Dave Harold 10–3 and Joe Swail 10–8, to be just one win away from reaching The Crucible for the first time, but he was thoroughly outplayed by Xiao Guodong in a 10–1 loss. The result ensured Li would not be among the top 64 in the world rankings who keep their places on the snooker tour as he was ranked number 86 and so he played in Q School in an attempt to earn his place back. Li lost in the last 128 of the first event and the last 32 of the second to confirm his exit from the tour.\n2014/2015 season.\nLi entered the three Asian Tour events during the 2014/2015 season, but was knocked out in the first round of each. He again entered Q School, but could not win a match in either of the events, losing 4–3 to both Daniel Wells and Jamie Clarke.\n2015/2016 season.\nLi only played in the Haining Open and was eliminated 4–1 in the first round by John Higgins."

        "text": "The Indiana Hoosiers baseball team is the varsity intercollegiate athletic team of Indiana University Bloomington in Bloomington, Indiana, United States. The team competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I and are members of the Big Ten Conference. The team plays at Bart Kaufman Field, which opened for the 2013 season.\nIn conference postseason play, Indiana has won four Big Ten Conference baseball tournaments and made eight NCAA Regionals appearances, including one College World Series appearance in 2013. In regular season play, the Hoosiers have won seven Big Ten Conference titles.\nHistory.\nCoach Andres, Lawrence, and Smith Eras (1949–1983).\nIn 1949, the Hoosiers hired Indiana University alum and former MLB third baseman Ernie Andres to manage the team. Andres would eventually become the longest serving head coach of IU baseball, to date, amassing a 388–367–3 overall record (129–209 conference record) during his 25-year tenure. Andres' Hoosiers would capture one Big Ten conference championship, while also finishing third or better in conference standings three times.\nIn 1974, Bob Lawrence replaced longtime-tenured coach Ernie Andres. In seven seasons with the Hoosiers, Lawrence compiled a 132–164 overall record (44–71 conference record); Lawrence never led Indiana to a post-season appearance, with his highest conference final standing of third place occurred in 1976.\nIn 1981, Larry Smith replaced Bob Lawrence as head coach for the Hoosiers. During Smith's three-year tenure at Indiana, he compiled a 74–74–1 overall record (13–30 conference record) and never achieved a post-season appearance.\nCoach Bob Morgan Era (1984–2005).\nIn 1984, Bob Morgan replaced Larry Smith as head coach of the Hoosiers. Morgan would take the Hoosiers to five Big Ten Conference baseball tournaments and one appearance in the NCAA Regionals. Indiana would lose in the opening round of the 1996 NCAA Midwest Regional to Wichita State, 4–0. Morgan would finish his career with Indiana in 2005, with an overall record of 782–499–4 in 21 years of managing the team as the second-longest tenured coach in Hoosiers' history.\nCoach Tracy Smith Era (2006–2014).\nOn June 23, 2005, Indiana replaced long-time coach Bob Morgan with former Miami (OH) head coach Tracy Smith.\nOn June 9, 2013, the Hoosiers completed a sweep of in the best of 3 Super Regional to advance to their first College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska. The Hoosiers would eventually lose 1–0 to Oregon State in the second round. Consequently, the 2013 roster would also notably include future-Chicago Cubs player Kyle Schwarber and his eventual selection in the 2014 Major League Baseball draft.\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2014 season, then-head coach Tracy Smith was hired by Arizona State to the same position. In nine years as head coach of the Hoosiers, Smith finished with a 287–237 overall record (127–111 conference record), two Big Ten Baseball Championships and three NCAA Regionals, including one College World Series appearance in 2013.\nCoach Chris Lemonis Era (2015–2018).\nOn July 24, 2014, the Indiana Hoosier's Athletic Department hired former Louisville assistant coach Chris Lemonis to replace Smith as head coach. On June 25, 2018, Mississippi State confirmed that it had hired Lemonis as their new head baseball coach, formally ending Lemonis' tenure with the Hoosiers. Lemonis compiled a 141–91–2 overall record, 55–37-1 conference record and three NCAA tournament appearances, while head coach of the Hoosiers.\nCoach Jeff Mercer Era (since 2019).\nOn July 2, 2018, Indiana University Athletics announced the hiring of former Wright State head coach Jeff Mercer, to the head coaching position for the Hoosiers. Mercer would then make a notable acquisition to the Hoosiers' coaching staff on July 18, 2018, with the hiring of former-MLB All Star third baseman Scott Rolen as Director of Player Development.\nOn May 18, 2019, the Hoosiers became the 2019 Big Ten regular season champions, following their win over Rutgers by a score of 13–3. Indiana would finish the regular season 36–19 overall and 17–7 in conference play.\nFollowing the culmination of the regular season, on May 21, 2019, Jeff Mercer was named Big Ten Coach of the Year. With the award, Mercer became the third Hoosier manager to be bestowed the honor.\nOn March 12, 2020, it was announced that the remainder of the 2020 season would be cancelled, due to the COVID-19 virus outbreak.\nHome fields.\nJordan Field (1887–1950).\nCreated in 1887, Indiana's first athletic grounds, Jordan Field was originally named University Athletic Field before being renamed in 1898, in honor of then-Indiana University President David Starr Jordan. The field was a mixed-use facility utilized by both the football and baseball teams. Bleacher seating for 4,000 persons were added in 1901, with field drainage added the following year to alleviate flooding.\nIn 1904, a track and field component was added to the athletic facility; however, conditions of the field continued to be a problem for the Hoosiers. The track and field portion of Jordan Field was upgraded in 1915. The final varsity athletic event for Jordan Field, a baseball game, would occur in 1950 prior to the facility being turned into a parking lot for the nearby Indiana Memorial Union.\nSembower Field (1951–2012).\nSembower Field was the main baseball stadium utilized by the Hoosiers from 1951 to 2012. It was named after former Indiana baseball player Charles Sembower. The stadium was located just north of the Foster Quadrangle dormitory on Fee Lane, less than 1 mile southeast of the current Hoosier baseball facility: Bart Kaufman Field. The former site of Sembower Field is presently used as a recreational sports complex for university students.\nBart Kaufman Field (since 2013).\nBart Kaufman Field is the home of the Hoosiers and is located in Bloomington, Indiana, on the campus of Indiana University. Indiana alumnus Bart Kaufman (1960–1962) pledged $2.5 million to start construction on the facility, with the rest of the funding coming from private donations and the university. Construction of Bart Kaufman Field was completed in March 2013 and formally dedicated on April 26. Bart Kaufman Field hosted its first Big Ten baseball tournament from May 24 through 28, 2017.\nNotable players.\nMajor League Baseball All-Stars.\n→=== Notable Drafted Players ===\nYear-by-year results.\nBelow is a table of the program's yearly records."

        "text": "The 1912 Australia rugby union tour of Canada and the United States was a collection of friendly rugby union games undertaken by the Australia national rugby union team against various invitational teams from Canada and the U.S, and also against the US national team.\nThe squad's leadership.\nDr. Otto Martin Bohrsmann (1869–1944) was tour manager. He was a Sydney physician who served as New South Wales Rugby Union treasurer for a number of years. Howell attributes the team's poor performance to a lack of discipline stemming from weakly imposed tour management. Bohrsmann's name would later be given to the landmark Mona Road, Darling Point, Sydney property Otto, which he bought in 1925 and which was retained by his descendants until 2010. His sister Altona would give her name to another Sydney landmark, a Point Piper home which in 2007 set the mark as Australia's most expensive home when it sold for A$50million.\nBilly Hill was the secretary of the New South Wales Rugby Union, he toured with the squad as Assistant Manager and refereed some of the matches. At this time team coaches were frowned upon, with the team captain expected to fulfill these duties.\nWard Prentice had toured with the 1908 Wallabies and had played both Tests of that tour. He had made three further Test appearances for Australia in 1910. He was a rugged on-field leader and the 1912 tour marked his swan-song in international rugby, appearing in fifteen of the sixteen matches. After World War I he had a brief first-grade rugby league career Sydney in 1920.\nTom Richards had also toured with the 1908 Wallabies and had played 1st grade rugby all over the world, making district representative sides in Queensland, New South Wales, South Africa and England. He was a leader in the forwards and a natural selection as tour vice-captain. He would later see active service with the AIF, landing on day one of the Gallipoli Campaign on 25 April 1915 and he would be awarded the Military Cross for conspicuous gallantry on the Western Front.\nTour itinerary.\nThe squad travelled by ship from Sydney to the US on the \"SS Moana\" with a number of the touring party confined to their cabins with sea-sickness for the first four days. Howell attributes the team's poor performance record to a focus placed on socialising. The squad was billeted out in college fraternity houses in California where the hospitality played havoc with team discipline. Howell quotes squad member Bob Adamson who spoke of the tour: \"We were never in bed. That was the trouble. I've never had such a time in my life\"\nTour statistics.\nThe tour took in 16 games with only 11 won by the Wallabies, including the sole Test of the tour played against the US All three matches played in Canada were lost by the Wallabies as well as one of the two matches against Stanford University and one of the three matches played against UC Berkeley. The team played in the light-blue jersey of New South Wales with a Waratah emblem and the word \"Australia\" on the chest.\nTouring party.\nThe second match of the 1912 New South Wales v Queensland interstate series acted as a selection trial for the tour and the Blues won the match 12–3 in Sydney. The selectors chose only six Queenslanders in the squad including Tom Richards, Jimmy Flynn, Lou Meibusch, Copper Kent, Peter Cunningham and Bob Willocks. Willocks withdrew from the touring squad before departure and his place was taken by fellow Queenslander William Murphy. Flynn and Meisbusch were still aged 18 years at the start of the tour.\nMatch summary.\nComplete list of matches played by the \"Wallabies\" in the Canada and the United States:\n Test matches"

He then transferred to the University of Oklahoma, where he played wide receiver for their football team. At the time, Oklahoma was more known for their rushing game, limiting Kimball's opportunities as a pass catcher, although he had a lot of experience blocking.\nKimball went undrafted in the 1979 NFL draft, although he signed with the Green Bay Packers as an undrafted free agent. After a solid showing the preseason, he became the only rookie free agent to make the team. He was expected to be utilized primarily on the punt and kick return teams.

He primarily played as a and .\nEarly career.\nBorn in Tweed Heads, Hunt grew up across the border on the Gold Coast, Queensland and played his first junior football for the Tugun Seahawks, where he represented the Queensland Country side. Hunt then moved to Sydney in 2008 to play in the inaugural season of the National Youth Competition with the Parramatta Eels. He played 3 games for the club before transferring mid season to the Wests Tigers, playing 4 games for them. From there, Hunt left the Tigers and played for a number of clubs in the following years.\nIn 2009, he spent the season with the North Sydney Bears in the NSW Cup where his nickname was swiney before moving back to Queensland in 2010, to play for the North Queensland Cowboys feeder club, the Mackay Cutters in the Queensland Cup. He trained in the off-season with the Cowboys but was unable to get a start in the first grade side. In 2011, he signed for the Brisbane Broncos feeder side the Redcliffe Dolphins. Once again he trained with the first grade side but was unable to make his NRL debut. After a great season for the Dolphins, he and team mate Ryan Carr, signed one year contracts with the South Sydney Rabbitohs for the 2012 season.\nNRL career.\nHunt started the 2012 season playing for South Sydney's feeder team, the North Sydney Bears. After 2 months of great form with Norths, Hunt made his first grade debut for South Sydney on the wing, in their round 11 victory against the St. George Illawarra Dragons. He scored his first try a week later against the Canberra Raiders.\nIn June 2012, he extended his contract at South Sydney for a further two seasons. He played in 10 games in 2012, scoring 5 tries.\nIn August 2013 Hunt announced that he had signed with the Parramatta Eels.

He was drafted 51st overall in the 1975 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors. Hawkins played for four teams during four seasons in the National Basketball Association, averaging 12.7 points per game, 1.5 assists per game and 2.3 rebounds per game.\nPersonal.\nHe was married to Barbara Hawkins, and had two sons, Robert Hawkins and Nathan Hawkins\nProfessional career.\nHawkins was drafted in the third round, 51st overall, by the Golden State Warriors in the 1975 NBA draft. He appeared in 32 games for the Warriors in his rookie season, averaging 3.9 points and 0.9 rebounds in only 4.8 minutes per game. He was released by the Warriors the day before the 1976–77 season began, and after being unable to land a roster spot with another team, was prepared to look for a job in a different industry. In December he was contacted by the New York Nets, in the middle of a disastrous first season in the NBA following the ABA–NBA merger. The Nets had been left short at the guard position following the sale of superstar Julius Erving due to financial difficulties. Hawkins quickly became the closest thing the Nets had to a star, averaging 19.3 points per game and leading Nets head coach Kevin Loughery to remark \"All I know is that Bubbles Hawkins has become a hero just when we needed one.\" That year, on February 7, 1977, Hawkins scored a career best 44 points in a 93–89 win over the New Orleans Jazz. During the festivities of the 1977 NBA All-Star Game, Hawkins faced and lost to Pete Maravich in the first round of an NBA-sanctioned game of horse as part of a televised tournament.\nHowever, Hawkins' NBA prominence would be relatively short lived, and Loughery's high opinion of Hawkins was not extended to the 1977–78 season, with the Nets now playing in New Jersey. Hawkins would play in only 15 games for the Nets that season, before being released after a series of conflicts with the coach. Hawkins would get one more chance in the NBA, signing before the 1978–79 season with the Detroit Pistons, but only appeared in four of the team's first nine games before again being released.\nDeath.\nOn November 28, 1993, Hawkins was found shot to death in what police said was a suspected crack house in Detroit. No arrests were ever made."

        "text": "Glenfield Rugby Union and Sports Club Inc. is a sports club based in Glenfield, a suburb of Auckland, New Zealand.\nHistory.\nThe club was formed in 1969 after a meeting between local rugby enthusiasts, some affiliated with Northcote Rugby, and then secretary of the Auckland Rugby Union, Link Warren.\nWith the support of the Auckland Rugby Union, a new club (under the umbrella of Northcote Rugby Union) was formed known as the Glenfield Rugby Football Club.\nThe original club was located on Archers Road, currently home to the Glenfield Rovers Football Club. Two or three years would pass before the North Shore City Council would provide new grounds to the club on former strawberry fields at Kaipatiki Road.\nGlenfield Rugby club was awarded senior status by the Auckland Rugby Union in 1973. From 1974 to 1984, Glenfield fielded a senior team in the Auckland Rugby Union third division. The Glenfield Grizzlies Presidents Grade side was also formed in 1975 by club stalwarts Glen \"Bungy\" Williams, Ken Cooksley, Ted Wilson, and Roy Doddrell. In 1985, the Glenfield Grizzlies team had the honour of playing at Twickenham in London, England. Glenfield club members refer to it jokingly as \"the game that made Twickenham famous\".\nFrom 1985 to 2019, Glenfield played in the Senior A division of the North Harbour Club rugby competition. For the 2019 and 2020 seasons Glenfield only fielded a team in the North Harbour Senior Reserves competition, before returning to play in the premier division of the North Harbour club competition in 2021. In 1986, Mark Hellyer became the first provincial player to be selected from Glenfield to play for the newly formed North Harbour Rugby Union. In 1987 Glenfield changed their colours from rust jerseys and blacks shorts to red and white jerseys with black shorts. Glenfield now plays in red, black and white hoops.\nIn 1989, Walter Little was the first All Black to be selected from the Glenfield club. Little went on to play for the New Zealand All Blacks from 1989 to 1998, playing in 55 test matches. Little also shares the record for most games played (147) for North Harbour, alongside Ron Williams, who played for the Northcote club. Walter's son Michael also represented Harbour from the Glenfield club and now plays his rugby in Japan. The Littles were the second father-son combination to be selected for North Harbour, alongside Frano and Jacob Botica from the North Shore club.\nGlenfield has been North Harbour Senior A club rugby runners-up twice, in 2000 and 2006. Glenfield has won two Under 21 Championships, in 1987 and 2008. Glenfield has also won a Senior C Championship in 1992, when they defeated Northcote at Onewa Domain.\nMark Hellyer (Glenfield Premiers 1981–1996) holds the record for most senior games played for Glenfield with 243 games.\nColours: Red, white and black jersey, Black shorts, Blacks socks with red and white bands\nChampionships.\nNorth Harbour Championships since 1985:\nNorth Harbour Under 21s: Champions (2) 1987, 2008. Runners-up 1985,2002,2003,2007\nNorth Harbour Senior C: Champions (1) 1992. Runners-up 1990,1991,1997\nNorth Harbour Premiership: Runners-up 2000, 2006.\nNorth Harbour Senior 1sts: Runners-up 1997.\nRivalries with other rugby clubs.\nThough overshadowed by the success of neighbouring clubs such as Northcote, Takapuna and East Coast Bays, Glenfield has strong rivalries with their neighbours, in particular the Northcote–Birkenhead Rugby club.\nGlenfield verses Northcote has always been classed as a friendly and respectful rivalry between the two clubs. Northcote were instrumental in helping to start the Glenfield club as a junior feeder club in 1969.\nTo many this rivalry would be seen as a \"Derby of contrasts\", as Northcote have established themselves as a North Harbour club rugby powerhouse winning numerous titles across all grades.\nGlenfield and Northcote have met in three Under 21 Championship finals (1987, 2002, 2003) with Glenfield winning in 1987, and Northcote winning in 2002 and 2003.\nGlenfield and Northcote have also met in three Senior C finals between in 1990, 1991, 1992 with Northcote winning in 1990, 1991 and Glenfield winning in 1992. The North Harbour Senior C competition trophy is named the Ted Wilson Cup after the late Glenfield rugby club stalwart and GRFC Life member Ted Wilson.\nThe Frazer King Memorial trophy is played for between Glenfield and North Shore. Frazer was a North Harbour referee who passed away suddenly whilst refereeing a premier game between Glenfield and North Shore at Devonport Domain in 1985.\nThe Birkenhead Transport has been played for between Glenfield and Marist North Harbour since 1989. The fact Glenfield and Marist are yet to win a North Harbour Premiership adds a lot of intense rivalry and colour to the games between the two clubs. The often games are often very close in scorelines between the two teams.\nWhen Mahurangi RFC joined the Harbour club comp in 1989, Glenfield was their first game. This is classed as a traditional game for Mahurangi as Glenfield is the first club they played in the Harbour club competition.\nGlenfield v Takapuna is one of North Harbour rugby's many suburban rivalries. Though when it comes to success both clubs are at opposite ends of the scale. Takapuna is by far the most successful North Harbour club winning twelve Harbour premierships. In the Auckland club competition days Takapuna was a regular team in the Auckland top division winning two Gallaher shields, whereas Glenfield played in the Auckland third division and were often on the end of some rather unflattering scorelines. Glenfield has met Takapuna twice in the North Harbour premiership final with Takapuna winning both times (2000 and 2006). Glenfield ended Takapuna's famous two year winning streak in 2001. Glenfield beat Takapuna in 2015, a game which was also Jeremy Hikuroa's 200th game for the Glenfield Premiers.\nGlenfield plays an annual pre–season fixture each year with Auckland club Waitakere City.\nNotable players.\nGlenfield Rugby Club centurions.\nThe following players have played 100 or more senior games for the club:"

        "text": "Larry William King (born January 30, 1945) is an attorney, pilot, real estate broker, American sports promoter, and the ex-husband of former World No. 1 professional tennis player Billie Jean King.\nEarly life and education.\nKing was born in Dayton, Ohio, and raised in Eagle Rock, California. He met Billie Jean Moffitt at California State University, Los Angeles in 1963, when he played on one of the school’s best men's tennis teams, coached by Scotty Deeds. He married Billie Jean on September 17, 1965 in Long Beach, California.\nCareer.\nIn 1971, King conceived the idea of a professional tennis tour for women and helped organize a group of nine (the Original Nine) top women players: Billie Jean King, Rosie Casals, Judy Dalton, Julie Heldman, Kerry Melville, Peaches Bartkowicz, Kristy Pigeon, Nancy Richey, and Valerie Ziegenfuss. He obtained the backing of Gladys Heldman of World Tennis Magazine and Joe Cullman, CEO of Philip Morris, and the Virginia Slims pro circuit was started. In 1973, along with Dennis Murphy, Jordan Kaiser and Fred Barman, King developed the concept of World Team Tennis, and started the league the following year. In 1974, King and Billie Jean co-founded and began publishing WomenSports magazine. \nIn 1976, King invented a smokeless ashtray, called The Clean Air King. In 1984, Billie Jean became the major owner of World Team Tennis. \nKing and Dennis Murphy also founded Roller Hockey International, a professional hockey league that operated from 1993 to 1999. Murphy had also been instrumental in the founding of the American Basketball Association and the World Hockey Association.\nKing, a director and master duplicate bridge player, founded the Money Bridge tour. He also founded Bridge University to promote bridge throughout the country.\nMarriage and personal life.\nKing had a big impact on the rise of his wife’s fame. Billie Jean was not always a feminist icon; in the 60s he had helped her start to think about the lack of scholarships for sports for women. He never tried to tear down Billie Jean’s aspirations of becoming a tennis superstar and promoted her success continuously. \nIn 1971, Billie Jean had an abortion that was made public in a \"Ms.\" magazine article. Larry had revealed Billie Jean's abortion without consulting her.\nIn 1973, Billie Jean defeated Bobby Riggs . In 2017, the film \"Battle of the Sexes\" was released. In the film, King was shown as becoming aware, that year, of Billie Jean's infidelity with another woman, and decided to ignore it; King said that was false.\nBillie Jean was sexually involved with her former secretary, Marilyn Barnett, during Larry and Billie Jean's marriage. In 1981, Billie Jean admitted publicly that the relationship had taken place, in response to a lawsuit by Barnett that asked for palimony. King and Billie Jean divorced in 1987.\nKing lives in Grass Valley, California, with his wife, Nancy, a cardiologist technician and pilot, and two children, Sky and Katie. According to the movie \"Battle of the Sexes\", Billie Jean King and her partner Ilana Kloss are godparents to the Kings' children."

He signed with the Philadelphia Phillies after graduating from Princeton University and appeared in four Major League Baseball (MLB) games — one as a pinch runner in and three as a pinch hitter in — all for the Phillies. Easton went hitless in three at bats and failed to score a run as a baserunner. He threw and batted right-handed, standing tall and weighing , during his playing days.\nEaston graduated from Trenton Central High School and was a member of Princeton's Class of 1955. He also played varsity basketball for the Tigers and captained their baseball team.\nEaston made his MLB debut only days after signing his first pro contract, pinch running for veteran catcher Andy Seminick in the second inning of the first game of a doubleheader, against the Chicago Cubs, at Wrigley Field. Easton was not able to advance from second base when the Phils' rally was snuffed out by an inning-ending double play. However, Marv Blaylock, who had replaced Easton in the lineup, would score the only run of the game, thirteen innings later, as the Phillies won, 1–0.\nEaston did not play in 1956 and much of 1957, serving in the United States Navy, but had an all-star year in for the Class A Williamsport Grays of the Eastern League, winning the batting title (.321), with 152 hits, including 35 doubles, ten triples, and 13 home runs. That earned him a second stint with the Phillies, to start the 1959 campaign, but in three pinch hitting appearances, Easton struck out all three times. He was sent back to the minor leagues, and retired after the 1959 season.\nEaston graduated with a degree in electrical engineering from Princeton and became a manager for Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Company (P S E &amp; G) (a public utility), retiring in 1995. A resident of Hopewell Township, Mercer County, New Jersey, he died at age 68 after battling melanoma on July 28, 2001."

Martin was a , right-handed pitcher who appeared in seven Major League games for the Pittsburgh Pirates. He was born at Brownstown, Pennsylvania.\nMartin was a 1950s bonus baby who joined the Pirates' MLB roster immediately after signing his first pro contract in 1955. In his debut, he hurled two scoreless innings in relief against that season's eventual world champions, the Brooklyn Dodgers. In his second appearance, on July 5, he started against the defending world champions, the New York Giants. But Martin walked Alvin Dark, Willie Mays and Dusty Rhodes and hit Don Mueller with a pitch in the first inning, failed to record an out, and was tagged with the loss, his only Major League decision.\nMartin sustained a career-ending arm injury that season. After an August 16 outing as a reliever, he never pitched in another professional game.\nIn seven Major League innings, Martin gave up 11 earned runs and 13 hits. Plagued by wildness, he issued 17 bases on balls, with one wild pitch and one hit batsman, while striking out three.\nMartin died in 2011 in San Diego, California, at the age of 79."

It was the first event to be held in the country of Republic of Macedonia and was organized by the nation's kickboxing president Ljupčo Nedelkovski, involving (mainly) amateur men and women from 31 countries across Europe. \nThere were three styles on offer at Skopje; Low-Kick, Thai-Boxing and Light-Contact. The other usual W.A.K.O. styles (Full/Semi Contact, Aero-Kickboxing and Musical Forms) were held at the earlier event in Lisbon. By the end of the championships Russia were easily the strongest country overall with a massive medals tally with Belarus came a distant second and Serbia not far behind in third place. The event was held in Skopje, Macedonia over six days, beginning on Tuesday 21 November and ending 26 November 2006. \nParticipating nations.\nThere were around 31 nations from across Europe participating at the 2006 W.A.K.O. European Championships in Skopje including:\nLow-Kick.\nSimilar to Full-Contact kickboxing, contestants in Low-Kick are allowed to kick and punch one another with full force, with the primary difference being that in Low-Kick they are also allowed to kick one another's legs, with matches typically won by decision or stoppage. As with other forms of amateur kickboxing, various head and body protection must be worn. More information on the style can be found at the W.A.K.O. website. Both men and women took part in Low-Kick at Skopje, with the men having twelve weight divisions ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs, and then women having six ranging from 48 kg/105.6 lbs to 70 kg/154 lbs and unlike more recent W.A.K.O. championships (aside from Lisbon) some countries were allowed more than one athlete per weight division.\nNotable winners in the category included Zurab Faroyan picking up his 4th gold medal in a row, which included winning in Full-Contact at the other European championships in Lisbon a month or so previously, while countryman Konstantin Sbytov picked up his 3rd gold medal. Other winners included multiple world champion Eduard Mammadov and Ibragim Tamazaev who had won at the last world championships in Agadir. Also in medal positions and more recognisable to western and international audiences were Michał Głogowski, Ludovic Millet and Mickael Lallemand who all won bronze medals. Russia continued her tradition of being the strongest nation in Low-Kick, easily dominating the medal positions with twelve gold, four silver and eight bronze. \nThai-Boxing.\nThai-Boxing, more commonly known as Muay Thai, is a type of kickboxing that allows the participants to throw punches, kicks, elbows and knees at full force to legal targets on the opponents body. Due to the physical nature of the sport, stoppages are not uncommon, although in amateur Thai-Boxing head and body protection must be worn. At Skopje both men and women took part in the style with the men having twelve weight divisions ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs and the women six, ranging from 52 kg/114.4 lbs to over 70 kg/154 lbs and unlike more recent W.A.K.O. championships (aside from Lisbon) some countries were allowed more than one athlete per weight division.\nThere were not too many recognisable winners in Thai-Boxing at Skopje although Vitaly Gurkov had won a number of amateur world championships with various organizations prior to this event and would go on to win a K-1 regional tournament as a pro. By the end of the championships Russia finally overhauled the dominance of Belarus in the style, coming out top with six gold, seven silver and seven bronze medals. \nLight-Contact.\nLight-Contact is a form of kickboxing that is less physical than Full-Contact but more so than Semi-Contact and is often seen as a transition between the two. Contestants score points on the basis of speed and technique over brute force although stoppages can occur, although as with other amateur forms head and body protection must be worn - more detail on Light-Contact rules can be found on the official W.A.K.O. website. The men had nine weight divisions ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 94 kg/+206.8 lbs while the women had six ranging from 50 kg/110 lbs to over 70 kg/154 lbs and unlike more recent W.A.K.O. championships (aside from Lisbon) some countries were allowed more than one athlete per weight division.\nAs it is often in the shadow of the full contact styles there were not many familiar faces in Light-Contact although Dezső Debreczeni, who is a regular winner in Light and Semi-Contact, won another gold medal. By the end of the championships Hungary prevented Russia from being top in all three styles at Skopje by winning three golds, two silvers and three bronze."

        "text": "W.A.K.O. World Championships 2005 in Szeged were the joint fifteenth world championships held by the W.A.K.O. organization and the third ever to be held in Hungary - with the other event having been held a couple of months earlier in Agadir, Morocco. The championships in Szeged were open to amateur men and women from across the world with around 720 athletes from 48 countries across five continents taking part.\nThere were four styles on offer at Szeged; Full-Contact, Light-Contact, Semi-Contact and Aero-Kickboxing. The other styles (Low-Kick, Thai-Boxing and Musical Forms) were held at the Agadir event. By the end of the championships, Russia were the strongest nation overall, followed closely by hosts Hungary, with Italy in third place. The event was held at the Városi Sportcsarnok in Szeged, Hungary on Monday, 28 November to Monday, 5 December 2005 in front of a crowd of around 4,000.\nParticipating nations.\nThere were around 48 nations from five continents across the world participating at the 2005 W.A.K.O. World Championships in Szeged including:\nFull-Contact.\nFull-Contact is a form of kickboxing where the contestants are allowed to throw punches and kicks at full force at legal targets above the waist. Victories are usually achieved via a point's decision or referee stoppage (e.g. KO/TKO) and as with most other forms of amateur kickboxing, all participants must wear the required head and body protection. More information on Full-Contact kickboxing and the rules can be found on the official W.A.K.O. website. Both men and women had competitions at Szegad, with the men having twelve weight divisions ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs and the women seven, ranging from 48 kg/105.6 lbs to over 70 kg/+143 lbs.\nDespite there not being as many familiar faces taking part in the style as in the past, there were a number of double winners who had won at the last European championships in Budva, with Zurab Faroyan and Daniel Martins picking up gold medals. There were also several winners who had won at the 2003 world championships in Paris with Jere Reinikainen and Karolina Lukasik winning gold, while Igor Kulbaev did even better by picking up his third gold medal in a row at a W.A.K.O. championships having also won at Budva and Paris. Regular leaders Russia were once again the top nation in Full-Contact, winning six gold, four silver and five bronze medals in both the male and female categories.\nLight-Contact.\nLight-Contact is a form of kickboxing where the contestants can aim kicks and punches thrown with moderate force at legal targets above the waist. It is less physical than Full-Contact but more so than Semi-Contact and is often seen as a transitional stage by fighters wishing to eventually move on to fully physical competition. Most fights are settled by a point's decision although stoppages can occur and like with other forms of amateur kickboxing, head and body protection must be worn. More information on Light-Contact can be found at the W.A.K.O. website. At Szeged the men had nine weight divisions ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 94 kg/+206.8 lbs while the women had six, ranging from 50 kg/110 lbs to over 70 kg/154 lbs.\nWhile not full of Nnticeable names there were a few stand out winners in Light-Contact with James Stewart and Tonje Sørlie winning two gold medals at the same championships (they would win in Semi-Contact as well) and regular winners Zoltan Dancso, Klara Morton and Nusa Rajher also picking up winners medals. By the end of the event Hungary were the strongest country in Light-Contact, winning four gold, four silver and two bronze medals.\nSemi-Contact.\nSemi-Contact is a form of kickboxing where the contestants are allowed to punch and kick one another at legal targets above the waist with minimal force being applied. Almost all matches are settled by a point's decision with the judges scoring on the basis of speed, technique and skill with power prohibited. Despite the less physical nature of the style, various head and body protection is mandatory. More information on Semi-Contact can be found at the W.A.K.O. website. As with Light-Contact the men had nine weight divisions ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 94 kg/+206.8 lbs while the women had six, ranging from 50 kg/110 lbs to over 70 kg/154 lbs.\nAlthough not exactly full of glamorous names there were nevertheless several notable winners in Semi-Contact with James Stewart and Tonje Sørlie winning two gold medals at the same championships (they would win in Light-Contact as well) and regular winners Dezső Debreczeni, Gregorio Di Leo (third gold medal in a row) and Luisa Lico also picking up winners medals. By the end of the championships, as with Light-Contact, Hungary were the strongest nation in Semi-Contact beating stiff competition from Italy, winning three golds, three silvers and two bronze medals."

        "text": "The Tennessee Volunteers men's golf team represents the University of Tennessee located in Knoxville, Tennessee. The Vols compete at the Division I level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Vols currently rotate between 16 different golf courses located in the state of Tennessee, with their main headquarters at the Blackburn-Furrow Golf Clubhouse at Day Golf Practice Facility, less than a mile from campus. The current coach for the Volunteer men is Brennan Webb who is in his 5th season as Tennessee's head coach. Since the Vol's inaugural season in 1934 they have won three SEC championships, competed in 17 NCAA Championships, and participated in 27 NCAA Regionals. \nHistory.\nThe Volunteers men's golf team began play in 1934 under coach James Walls. It would take forty-five years before the Vols would win their first conference title mainly under the terrific play of Jim Gallagher Jr. and Stuart Smith, who both finished in the top five of the tournament. That same year, the Vols reached their highest finish in the NCAA Championships, finishing in 6th place. In 1988, Tennessee had its deepest run in the NCAA singles competition when Tom Carr finished runner-up among the other individuals.\nJim Kelson era.\nWhen Jim Kelson was hired in 1998, the Vols were just coming off a losing season that ended the three-year streak of NCAA Tournament appearances. In his first year, he led his team to 101 wins and a 5th-place finish in the SEC Tournament.\nKelson guided Tennessee to three straight NCAA Championship berths from 2009–2011. It was Tennessee's fifth NCAA Championship berth under Kelson since the 2003 season. He also guided the Vols to regional play for a school-record 15 consecutive seasons from 2000–2014. The 2007 season became a very memorable season for coach Kelson as he helped end a 17-year drought for the Vols in the SEC tournament by beating Alabama by two strokes to claim the SEC title. In the 2010 season, Kelson helped the Volunteers capture the Carpet Capital Collegiate Golf Tournament for the first time in school history. During his tenure, the Vols won 25 tournament championships, as well as several team individual accolades, and made 7 NCAA Championship appearances.\nOn June 12, 2018, Kelson announced he was retiring and stepped down from his position as head coach. Sean Pacetti served as the interim head coach until Brennan Webb, the former head golf coach at Middle Tennessee University, was hired on June 28, 2018 as the next head golf coach at Tennessee.\nBrennan Webb era.\nUnder current head coach Brennan Webb, the Vols have posted four consecutive seasons with a win percentage above .600. Additionally, under the new SEC Championship match-play structure (which began in 2018), Webb has led the Vols to top 8 SEC finishes and the SEC Quarterfinals each year. The Vols have also made 4 NCAA Regionals in Webb's five years (the 2020 regionals were cancelled), and qualified for the 2021 NCAA Championships, ending a 7 year program drought.\nHead coaches.\nSource\nNote: Records for coaches James Walls and Lloyd Foree are incomplete for certain seasons.\nYearly record.\nSources\nIndividual honors.\nIn the past 76 years of the Vols men's golf program four UT golfers have won SEC individual titles and 38 UT golfers have earned 58 All-SEC honors, in-addition to 20 Vols earning All-American honors.\nTour professionals.\nSeveral former University of Tennessee golf players have played on major golf tours.\nNotable amateur victories.\nGarrick Porteous, who played for the Volunteers from 2008–2012, won The Amateur Championship in 2013.\nMack and Jonnie Day Golf Facility.\nAlthough the Vols men’s and women’s golf teams host their home matches at a variety of different courses in the state of Tennessee they have recently welcomed a new state of the art practice facility on campus where the team can practice all year round. The practice facility resides on a 28-acre lot across from the University's Medical Center and contains a 3-hole course plus putting green. The new facility opened in 2010 and was finished in 2019 with the Blackburn-Furrow Golf Clubhouse. The 8,300 square foot clubhouse features offices for both the men and women's teams, heated hitting bays for year-round practice, video training space, locker rooms, team lounges, over 1,200 square feet of outdoor deck spaces, and a virtual-putting green.

        "title": "Equestrian statue of Nathanael Greene",
        "text": "Major General Nathanael Greene is a bronze equestrian statue honoring Nathanael Greene, a military leader during the American Revolutionary War. Greene was from modern-day Rhode Island and after laws passed by the Kingdom of Great Britain, along with the burning of one of his ships, Greene formed a state militia. He was later promoted to brigadier general in the Continental Army where he became a trusted adviser to Commander-in-Chief General George Washington. Greene played an active role during the war, participating in battles, sieges, and campaigns from New England to the Southern Colonies. For his service to the war, Greene was offered free land and settled in Georgia with his family. He died a few years later from a heatstroke. \nSoon after the war concluded, the Congress of the Confederation passed a resolution to honor Greene with a memorial in the nation's capital. Nothing happened for almost 100 years until 1874 when Congress authorized $40,000 to be spent on an equestrian statue of Greene. A further $10,000 was allocated the following year for the pedestal. The sculptor chosen to create the statue, Henry Kirke Brown, had already made a statue of Greene that stands in the National Statuary Hall Collection. The pedestal was installed Christmas Eve 1877, and the statue was placed in position early the following year. The statue was well-received and is considered one of the best equestrian statues in Washington, D.C. It is located in the center of Stanton Park in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, a couple of blocks east of the U.S. Capitol.\nA wind storm and corroded rivets resulted in the statue toppling over in 1930, but it was mostly unharmed. Greene's statue is one of 14 American Revolution Statuary in Washington, D.C., that were collectively listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1978 and the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites (DCIHS) the following year. In addition, the statue is a contributing property to the L'Enfant Plan and the Capitol Hill Historic District.\nHistory.\nBiography.\nNathanael Greene was born on August 7, 1742, at Forge Farm in the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, present-day Rhode Island. He was born into a Quaker upper-income family. Despite his family's religious beliefs against \"book learning,\" Greene convinced his father to hire a tutor. The tutor, Ezra Stiles, would later become president of Yale College. Greene's father trained him to be a founder when his son wasn't learning classical education during the Age of Enlightenment. In 1770, Greene moved to his home in Coventry, Rhode Island, to run the family's foundry. That same year his father died, leaving the family business to Greene and his brothers. He married Catharine Littlefield Greene in 1774, with whom he had seven children.\nThe Kingdom of Great Britain imposed heavy fines and taxes on the Thirteen Colonies after the French and Indian War. On one occasion, a British officer seized a boat owned by the Greene family. Greene sued, and although he won the case, his boat was burnt during the 1772 Gaspee affair. He became disillusioned with not only his loyalty to the British, but also his religious faith. Greene was ultimately banned from Quaker meetings in 1773. After what the colonists nicknamed the Intolerable Acts, in 1774 Greene organized the Kentish Guards, consisting of Rhode Island militia. Due to a limp Greene had since childhood, he was not commissioned an officer in the Kentish Guards.\nFor the next year, Greene recruited men to fight against the British. His actions impressed colonial leaders and he was put in charge of three militias by the state Colonial Assembly. Before the American Revolutionary War began in 1775, Greene was commissioned a brigadier general in the Continental Army and became a trusted adviser to George Washington. During the war, Greene participated in numerous battles and campaigns. He assisted with the Siege of Boston, the New York and New Jersey campaign, commandeering Fort Constitution, the Battle of Trenton, the Battle of Germantown, and served as quartermaster general at Valley Forge during the winter of 1777-1778. Greene was sent to the southern colonies to assist with the southern campaign. Some of the battles where he participated include the Battle of Guilford Court House, the Battle of Hobkirk's Hill, and the Battle of Eutaw Springs.\nAfter the war concluded, many people considered Greene to have been the second-best general in the Continental Army, with the first being Washington. Some of the southern states offered Greene land confiscated from loyalists. He settled in Georgia at the Mulberry Grove Plantation, but died three years later on June 19, 1786, from a heat stroke. His ashes were interned under the Nathanael Greene Monument in Savannah, Georgia.\nMemorial plans and dedication.\nSoon after the Revolutionary War ended, the Congress of the Confederation passed a resolution to erect a memorial in the nation's capital honoring Greene. For unknown reasons, this did not occur until almost 100 years later. The area that now surrounds Stanton Park was named after Abraham Lincoln's Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton, sometime in the early 1870s. The area was mostly undeveloped after the Civil War. In order to spur growth around the square and to honor a national hero, Congress authorized the erection of an equestrian statue of Greene on June 23, 1874. One member from the Senate and one from the House of Representatives were to join Green's grandson, George Washington Greene, on a commission to complete the statue's installation at a cost of $40,000. Congress authorized an additional $10,000 for the pedestal on March 3, 1875.\nThe sculptor chosen to create the statue was Henry Kirke Brown, whose other works include the equestrian statue of Winfield Scott in Washington, D.C., the equestrian statue of George Washington in New York City, and the Washington Monument at West Point, New York. In addition to these outdoor statues, Brown sculpted the statue of Nathanael Greene and others for the National Statuary Hall Collection. Brown was unhappy with the amount he earned for Greene's equestrian statue.\nCongress authorized the placement of the statue in 1877. On Christmas Eve 1877, the pedestal, made by the Quincy Granite Company, was installed. Brown returned to Washington, D.C., after the holidays to supervise the statue being placed on the pedestal. The statue, which was founded by Robert Wood &amp; Company, was praised by critics, who noted the fine details of the horse and Greene. It is considered one of the best equestrian statues in Washington, D.C. The surrounding park was improved over the next couple of years, with fencing, sidewalks, and trees added.\nLater history.\nIn June 1930, what newspapers called a \"freakish gust of wind,\" blew through Stanton Park, toppling the statue. The statue's head and shoulders were buried into the ground, but remarkably the statue was unharmed, except for a small crack on the horse's left thigh. It was found the rivets were corroded, making the statue easily susceptible to falling. The statue was lifted back in place by using a derrick.\nThe Greene statue is one of 14 American Revolution Statuary that were collectively listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on July 14, 1978. The statuary was added to the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites (DCIHS) the following year on March 3, 1979. Because of its location on a square planned by Pierre Charles L'Enfant, the statue is a contributing property to the L'Enfant Plan, listed on the NRHP and DCIHS on April 24, 1997, and January 19, 1971, respectively. In addition, the statue is a contributing property to the Capitol Hill Historic District, which was added to the DCIHS on June 19, 1973, followed by the NRHP a few years later on August 27, 1976. The statue and surrounding park are owned and maintained by the National Park Service.\nLocation and design.\nLocation.\nGreene's statue is sited in the center of Stanton Park (Reservation 15), also known as Stanton Square, in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Stanton Park is bounded by 4th Street, 5th Street, 6th Street, and C Street SE, and is also where Maryland Avenue and Massachusetts Avenue SE intersect. The park is around 0.5 miles (0.8 km) northeast of the United States Capitol. It is the only public space in Washington, D.C., that is not named after the memorial which is located there.\nDesign.\nThe bronze statue of Greene is 11-feet (3.4 m) tall and 15-feet (4.6 m) long. It rests on a granite oval base measuring 14-feet (4.3 m) tall, 17-feet (5.2 m) long, and 8-feet (2.4 m) wide. Greene is riding a horse that has its right leg up while trotting. Greene is wearing his Colonial Army uniform and a three-cornered hat. He is depicted leading his soldiers into battle while holding the horse's reins with his left hand. Greene's right arm is pointing ahead, reminiscent of a military officer pointing the enemy to his troops.\nThe inscription on the base reads:"

        "text": "General Casimir Pulaski is a bronze equestrian statue of Casimir Pulaski, a military man born in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. He joined the military at a young age, fighting for removal of the king, who was backed by Russia. After his side lost the war, he fled to Paris, where he met Benjamin Franklin. Impressed by Pulaski, Franklin wrote a letter of recommendation to George Washington, suggesting he would be a helpful soldier during the American Revolutionary War. After arriving in the U.S., Pulaski eventually was promoted to Brigadier General and commanded a cavalry unit, the Pulaski's Legion. He died in 1779 due to injuries sustained in battle.\nIn 1903, Congress authorized the installation of a statue honoring two Poles who assisted America in the war: Pulaski and Tadeusz Kościuszko. Each statue was allocated $50,000 for its creation and installation. The person chosen to sculpt the Pulaski statue was Kazimierz Chodziński, who was assisted by architect Albert Randolph Ross. The unveiling and dedication ceremony took place on May 11, 1910, and was attended by thousands of Polish Americans. Prominent attendees included President William Howard Taft, who spoke at the ceremony, and Secretary of War Jacob M. Dickinson, who delivered the keynote speech.\nThe statue is located on the eastern end of Freedom Plaza, near the intersection of 13th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. It shows a mounted figure of Pulaski, holding the reins to his horse, while wearing his Polish military uniform. There is a large plaque on the base of the marble statue.\nThe statue is one of 14 American Revolution statues in Washington, D.C., that were collectively listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The statue is also a contributing property to the Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site and the L'Enfant Plan, both listed on the NRHP.\nHistory.\nBiography.\nCasimir Pulaski was born in 1745 to wealthy parents in Warsaw, Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. By 1762 he already joined the military. A few years later. Pulaski joined other Polish nobility in the Bar Confederation that wanted to dethrone King Stanisław August Poniatowski, who was backed by Russia. During the war, Pulaski served as a cavalry commander. He was forced to flee to Paris when the Russians won the war. It was in Paris where Pulaski met Benjamin Franklin, who encouraged Pulaski to join the Thirteen Colonies fighting in the American Revolutionary War against the Kingdom of Great Britain. Franklin wrote a letter of recommendation of Pulaski for George Washington. \nNot long after Pulaski arrived in the colonies in 1777, he had a meeting with Washington, who was impressed by Pulaski and his military skills. Washington spoke with the Continental Congress, asking if Pulaski could lead the Continental Cavalry. Due to opposition by Congress, Pulaski worked with Washington as a volunteer aide instead. During the Battle of Brandywine in 1777, Pulaski was able to delay British forces long enough for Washington and his troops time to retreat. For his efforts, Congress promoted Pulaski to brigadier general of the cavalry.\nHe eventually became tired of the cavalry he commanded and, after speaking with Washington, formed the cavalry unit, Pulaski's Legion. Washington asked the legion to guard Charleston, South Carolina, and after seeing his talent, continental and French forces were impressed. He later fought with the colonial and French forces in Savannah, Georgia, where he was mortally wounded in 1779 during battle. For his services, Pulaski is known as the \"Father of the American cavalry.\"\nMemorial plans.\nIn February 1903, Congress approved two statues being erected, one for Pulaski and another statue honoring Polish military hero Tadeusz Kościuszko. The allocation for each statue was $50,000. An Act of Congress authorized the two statues on February 27. The Pulaski statue would be located on Pennsylvania Avenue and the Kościuszko statue in Lafayette Square.\nThe sculptor hired to create the Pulaski statue, Kazimierz Chodziński, was at the request of Polish American groups. The architect chosen to assist with the statue was Albert Randolph Ross. The Gorham Manufacturing Company was hired as the founder and the Maine &amp; New Hampshire Granite Company served as the contractor. In 1910, Congress authorized an additional $5,000 for the unveiling and dedication ceremony. Polish Americans were able to see both of the statue unveilings as the ceremonies occurred on the same day.\nDedication.\nA day before the unveiling and dedication ceremony, the Polish National Alliance received a cable from former President Theodore Roosevelt, who was in Berlin at the time, stating: \"Accept my congratulations to all Americans of Polish birth or origin on the dedication of the monuments to the two great Polish heroes, Kościuszko and Pulaski, whose names will be forever associated on the honor role of American history.\" News of the message from Roosevelt spread quickly amongst the thousands of Poles and Polish Americans who had travelled to Washington, D.C., for the event. \nThe unveiling took place on On May 11, 1910. The ceremony for the Kościuszko statue took place at 2:30pm and the one for Pulaski at 4pm. Prominent attendees included Secretary of War Jacob M. Dickinson, who delivered the keynote speech at the Pulaski ceremony, and President William Howard Taft, who spoke at both ceremonies. A Pulaski descendant, Francis Pulaski, who spoke at the second event, said \"He brought to your shores his bravery and his military talents and offered them for the defense of your ideals and your independence.\"\nTaft accepted both statues on behalf of the United States. Between the two events, the president and other officials watched an hour-long parade featuring thousands of people, including the entire District of Columbia National Guard and members from Polish societies. The ceremony at the Pulaski statue lasted around an hour and a banquet attended by Taft took place later that night at the Raleigh Hotel.\nLater history.\nThe statue was originally on a triangular park, Reservation 33, but was moved to another triangular park, Reservation 32, in 1931. It was moved back to its original location in 1958. The two reservations were merged in 1980 when Freedom Plaza opened.\nThe statue of Pulaski is one of 14 American Revolution statues that were collectively listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on July 14, 1978. The following year the statues were added to the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites. In addition, the Pulaski statue is a contributing property to the Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site, listed on the NRHP on October 15, 1966, and the L'Enfant Plan, listed on the NRHP on April 24, 1997.\nLocation and design.\nThe bronze Pulaski statue is located on the eastern side of Freedom Plaza, the city's Reservations 32 and 33, near the intersection of Pennsylvania Avenue and 13th Street NW in downtown Washington, D.C. It is 9-feet tall (2.7 m) and rests on a 12-foot tall (3.7 m), 15-foot long (4.6 m) marble base. Pulaski is riding a horse, which has its front right leg raised while trotting. Pulaski, dressed in his Polish military uniform as a cavalry commander, is wearing a long military coat and a decorative hat. He is holding onto the horse's reins while his feet are in the stirrups. The statue is resting on an oval base adorned with foliage and meandros. There are three steps surrounding the base.\nInscriptions.\nThe inscriptions read:\nBase, Left Side:\n&lt;poem&gt;Brandy Wine\nValley Forge\nEgg Harbor\nBrigadier General US\nMarshal General Poland\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nBase, Right Side:\n&lt;poem&gt;Charlestown\nSavannah\nGermantown\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nBase, Front Rounded End:\n&lt;poem&gt;Brigadier General\nCasimir Pulaski\n1741–1779\nFell in Battle at Savannah\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nBase Plaque:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nBrigadier General\nBrigadier General Casimir Pulaski,\nPortrays the Revolutionary War Hero In\nThe Uniform of a Polish Cavalry Commander.\nBorn in Wniary, Poland on March 4, 1748\nTo a Noble Family, Pulaski Gained \nProminence in Europe for His Role In\nDefending Liberty in Poland.

Founded in 1965 under the name ASPTT Metz, the club has an exceptional track record with some 40 titles won, which is the all-time record for a French women's team sport. Chaired by Thierry Weizman since 2005, the club is becoming increasingly professional and now aims to play a leading role in Europe.\nThe men's team also played in 1st League between 1971 and 1983, and nowadays plays in Nationale 1 (3rd division) since 2020.\nHistory.\nIf Metz Handball has become, over the last decades, the most prestigious women's handball club in France, it is also one of the oldest institutions playing in the French elite.\nThe club was created in 1965 under the name of ASPTT Metz, but it will be necessary to wait a few more years to see the creation of a feminine team in 1968, which make the current fame of the club.\nVice-champions of France and semi-finalists of the Cup of Cups in 1977, the men's team gave ASPTT Metz its first prestige. But in the shadow, the women's team progressed year after year until being promoted in 1986 in the best league in France, without ever leaving it since. The coach of the team at that time was French Olivier Krumbholz, who later became the successful national manager for France. \nSince the promotion, Metz HB has had overwhelming success with 24 National Championships from 1989 to 2022, which is the all-time record in the French Women's First League Championship.\nMetz Handball is progressively establishing itself as a strong place in European handball. A first epic saw the Dragonnes reach the semi-final of the Cup Winners Cup in 1999. They then became famous in the EHF Cup where, after several quarter finals, they played a first European final in 2013 but did not manage to win the title. The following seasons, the club gains momentum and shines in the Champions League. Unlucky quarter-finalists in 2017 and 2018, Metz participated for the first time in the Final 4 of Europe's most prestigious competition in 2019, where they finished fourth.\nAfter a season without any trophy in 2021, Metz Handball realizes the most beautiful season of its history. The club won a 24th French Championship title, a 10th French Cup, and became famous in the Ligue Butagaz Énergie with a flawless record: 26 victories in 26 games.

The tour included three Tests and five One Day Internationals (ODIs) between Sri Lanka and South Africa.\nThe Test series was won by South Africa, 2–1. South Africa won the first Test in Centurion and Sri Lanka won the second in Durban, before South Africa won the third and deciding Test at Newlands, Cape Town, played from 3 to 6 January 2012. It was the first time that South Africa had won a Test series played in South Africa since 2008. AB De Villiers was the man of the series, scoring 353 runs at an average of 117.66.In the second test Sri Lanka won its first ever test match on South African soil.\nSouth Africa won the ODI series 3–2. De Villiers, the newly appointed South African ODI captain, was again the man of the series with 329 runs at an average of 109.66.\nTest Series.\n1st Test.\nAfter winning the toss and electing to field, South Africa's opening bowlers struck early, with Dale Steyn and Vernon Philander taking the wickets of Tillakaratne Dilshan and Kumar Sangakkara respectively. Sri Lanka's other batsmen—Tharanga Paranavitana, Mahela Jayawardene, Thilan Samaraweera and Angelo Mathews—each made starts but were dismissed in their thirties. Sri Lanka lost their final six wickets for just 24 runs, being bowled out for 180 just before tea on the first day. Philander took five wickets, becoming only the fifth bowler in history to take five wickets in an innings in each of his first three Tests. Steyn took four wickets for 18 runs.\nBy the end of the first day, South Africa had reached 90 runs, half of Sri Lanka's first innings total, for the loss of one wicket, and captain Graeme Smith had scored a half-century. They continued to bat for the whole of the second day, sitting at 9/389 at stumps. South Africa's top scorer was AB de Villiers, who was controversially dismissed on 99 runs. Substitute fieldsman Dimuth Karunaratne claimed to have caught him at backward point, although replays showed the ball may have hit the ground before sliding into his fingers. De Villiers elected to accept Karunaratne's word and, one run short of his 13th Test century, decided against referring the dismissal for a video review.\nOn the third morning of the match, Mark Boucher and Imran Tahir enjoyed a final-wicket partnership that took South Africa to 411 runs, a lead of 231, with Boucher finishing on 65. South Africa's bowlers proceeded where they left off after the first innings, bowling Sri Lanka out within 40 overs, for just 150. Philander took another five wickets, giving him ten for the match, and was named player of the match. South Africa won by an innings and 81 runs.\n2nd Test.\nSri Lanka called up 22-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman Dinesh Chandimal to make his Test debut, replacing Kaushal Silva. In-form bowler Vernon Philander withdrew from South Africa's team due to injury. In his place, 21-year-old fast bowler Marchant de Lange made his debut.\nDe Lange made an instant impact. After Sri Lanka won the toss and decided to bat, he took seven wickets, including those of Kumar Sangakkara, for a duck, and Thilan Samaraweera, who top-scored for Sri Lanka with 102. De Lange's figures of 7/81 were the best for any bowler in Test cricket in 2011. Chandimal also enjoyed a successful first innings of Test cricket, scoring 58 in Sri Lanka's total of 338.\nIn response, South Africa were dismissed within the second day for a total of 168, only narrowly avoiding being asked to follow on. Pace bowler Chanaka Welegedara took five wickets and spinner Rangana Herath took four. Hashim Amla was the only South African batsman to score a half-century, with 54. Sri Lanka pressed their advantage batting on the third day of the Test. Sangakkara, at the time the top-ranked Test batsman in the world, scored his 28th Test century, making 108, while Chandimal (54) scored his second half-century of the match. Dale Steyn took five wickets as Sri Lanka were bowled out on the fourth morning of the match for 279.\nSouth Africa needed 450 in the fourth innings to win the match, and fell well short of the target, being bowled out on the fourth day for 241. For the first time in 149 Tests, Jacques Kallis was dismissed for a pair (a duck in each innings). Herath took Kallis' wicket and four others, finishing with five for the innings and nine for the match to claim the \"player of the match\" award. AB de Villiers was South Africa's top scorer with 69; Amla scored his second half-century of the match, with 51. Sri Lanka's win levelled the series 1–1. It was their first Test win in 18 months, and their first in South Africa.\n3rd Test.\nSouth Africa's underperformance in the second Test caused their team selectors to drop batsman Ashwell Prince. He was replaced by Alviro Petersen, the 31-year-old Highveld Lions captain, recalled to the side to play in his tenth Test. Petersen was selected to open the batting, relegating Jacques Rudolph to occupy Prince's position at number six in South Africa's line-up. Vernon Philander returned to the team after recovering from the injury that kept him out of the second Test, replacing Marchant de Lange despite de Lange's impressive debut. Sri Lanka replaced injured bowler Dilhara Fernando with Dhammika Prasad, and dropped opener Tharanga Paranavitana for Lahiru Thirimanne.\nSri Lanka won the toss and elected to bowl, a decision called into question when South Africa ended the first day at 3/347. Prasad took the early wickets of Graeme Smith and Hashim Amla, but then followed large partnerships between Petersen and Jacques Kallis, and Kallis and AB de Villiers. On the second day of the Test, South Africa reached 4/580, declaring before the tea break. Kallis scored 224, de Villiers was not out on 160, and Petersen had scored a century upon his recall to the team, with 109. Kallis' double century was his second in Test cricket. It was Kallis' 150th Test; he became the sixth player in history and the first South African to reach the milestone.\nSouth Africa then proceeded to bowl Sri Lanka out twice. First, they were bowled out for 239, after which South Africa enforced the follow on. Needing 341 to avoid an innings defeat and force South Africa to bat again, Sri Lanka reached 342 after a century to Thilan Samaraweera (115 not out). Needing just two runs to win, Alviro Petersen hit the winning run off a Prasad no-ball on the Test's fourth day. South Africa thus won the series 2–1, their first series win at home since 2008. It was Sri Lanka's fourth defeat out of the four Test series they had ever played in South Africa. Kallis was named the player of the match; de Villiers was the player of the series, scoring 353 runs at an average of 117.66.\nODI Series.\n1st ODI.\nThe first of the five matches in the ODI series, held at Boland Park, Paarl, marked the debut of AB de Villiers as South Africa's captain in the format. De Villiers succeeded Graeme Smith after the 2011 World Cup, although Smith remained in the team as a batsman.\nDe Villiers won the toss, decided to bat, and his team responded by piling on 301 runs for the loss of eight wickets. His vice-captain Hashim Amla top scored with 112 off 128 balls; it was Amla's ninth ODI century, underlining his position as the International Cricket Council's top-ranked batsman in the format. Jacques Kallis (72) and de Villiers (52) each scored half-centuries before the team's progress was halted by a late run of wickets taken by Lasith Malinga. Malinga finished South Africa's innings with figures of 5/54, his fifth five-wicket haul in ODIs.\nIn response, Sri Lanka—who just nine months earlier had been World Cup finalists—collapsed to be all out for 43 runs off barely 20 overs. Four players made ducks, including both opening batsman, Tillakaratne Dilshan and Upul Tharanga. Sri Lanka's leading batsman, Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene also failed, out for four and two respectively. Kosala Kulasekara's 19 was the only Sri Lankan innings to reach double figures. Morné Morkel took four wickets and was named man of the match, Lonwabo Tsotsobe took three. South Africa's 258-run winning margin was the third highest in the history of ODI cricket. It was Sri Lanka's largest ever defeat and South Africa's largest ever win, while Sri Lanka's 43 runs was the lowest score in their history. Sri Lanka's captain Dilshan said after the match that it was the \"worst game of my career\", and defended the exclusion of Thilan Samaraweera, the team's top batsman in the recently concluded Test series, from the ODI squad.\n2nd ODI.\nFollowing their heavy defeat in the first ODI, Sri Lanka made two changes to their team enforced due to injury. Rangana Herath replaced fellow spinner Ajantha Mendis, while pace bowler Dhammika Prasad was called up to play in the place of Dilhara Fernando. South Africa made no changes to their team.\nAfter being sent into bat, Sri Lanka started slowly, scoring 37 runs off the first 15 overs for the loss of two wickets. Upul Tharanga and Dinesh Chandimal combined for a third wicket partnership of 84, before Tharanga was caught behind off Morné Morkel's bowling for 66. Chandimal went on to make 92 not out, and Sri Lanka completed its 50 overs on the score of 6/236. Morkel and Lonwabo Tsotsobe took two wickets each for South Africa.\nSouth Africa started their innings comparatively quickly, reaching 0/75 after their first 15 overs. From there, starts to all their specialist batsman (none scored less than 17) ensured they reached Sri Lanka's target with eight balls to spare. Hashim Amla followed up his century in the first match of the series with a half-century (55 off 58 balls), while JP Duminy top scored and won the man of the match award, with 66 not out off 87 balls.\n3rd ODI.\nSouth Africa were without two of their key batsman as they looked to gain a series-winning 3–0 lead in Bloemfontein. Vice-captain Hashim Amla took paternal leave while veteran all-rounder Jacques Kallis was rested. Colin Ingram and Alviro Petersen took their places.\nSri Lanka's vice-captain Angelo Mathews spoke before the match about his team's aim to score 250 runs in the match. They won the toss, elected to bat, and achieved Mathews' target, completing 50 overs at 9/266. Opening batsmen Tillakaratne Dilshan and Upul Tharanga scored Sri Lanka's first 94 runs before Kumar Sangakkara, Dinesh Chandimal and Kosala Kulasekara scored over 30 runs each and Tharanga top-scored with 58. South Africa started their run chase badly, with the early loss of Graeme Smith and Colin Ingram to the bowling of Lasith Malinga. Faf du Plessis recovered South Africa's prospects; promoted to fourth in the batting lineup, he scored 72 off 74 balls before being run out. Quick scoring from JP Duminy and AB de Villiers helped take South Africa to 5/179 when rain struck after 34 overs. The rain was too heavy and persistent to allow the match to restart, and South Africa were deemed to be the winners of the match by four runs according to the Duckworth–Lewis method.\n4th ODI.\nSouth Africa rested Dale Steyn and Albie Morkel for the dead rubber fourth match of the series, calling up Wayne Parnell and Vernon Philander in their places. For Sri Lanka, Lahiru Thirimanne replaced the injured Mahela Jayawardene and off spinner Sachithra Senanayake made his debut, replacing pace bowler Dhammika Prasad.\nSouth Africa's Test captain Graeme Smith had been under pressure to retain his position in the ODI side after a string of mediocre performances with the bat. Batting first, he enjoyed an 87-run opening partnership with Alviro Petersen and made 68 runs off 69 balls. AB de Villiers made 96, promoting himself to number three in the batting lineup, before being bowled by Thisara Perera. Sitting at 3/242 after 39 overs, South Africa were heading towards a total well in excess of 300; however, a late run of wickets slowed their progress and they finished their 50 overs on 7/299.\nIn response, Sri Lanka successfully chased a target of 300 or more for the first time against South Africa. Captain Tillakaratne Dilshan scored 87 off 87 balls, Dinesh Chandimal scored 59, and Thisara Perera scored five sixes in his 69 off 44 balls. Perera's fast scoring ensured Sri Lanka reached the target in the 49th over, avoiding a series whitewash.\n5th ODI.\nHaving been sent into bat by Sri Lanka, South Africa scored 312 off 50 overs, thanks to centuries from Graeme Smith and AB de Villiers (both 125). Sri Lanka chased down the total with one ball to spare, making it the second time in ODIs that a team had successfully reached a target of 300 or more in consecutive matches. Kumar Sangakkara top-scored with 102, while Lahiru Thirimanne scored 69.\nThe match turned out to be Tillakaratne Dilshan's last as Sri Lanka's captain. After the match he resigned his position and was replaced by Mahela Jayawardene."

England had their first defences of the ICC Test Championship number-one ranking they acquired at home in August 2011. While they retained the spot throughout the season, they showed their weaknesses in Asian conditions as they were whitewashed in a three-Test series against Pakistan.

        "title": "W.A.K.O. European Championships 2006 (Lisbon)",
        "text": "W.A.K.O. European Championships 2006 (Lisbon) were the joint eighteenth European kickboxing championships held by the W.A.K.O. organization (the other event would be held the next month in Skopje, Macedonia) and the second to be held in Portugal and the city of Lisbon. The event was open to amateur men and women from across Europe although a number of professional fighters such as Luis Reis would take part. All in all, it was the largest ever European championships with around 560 athletes from 31 countries taking part. One of the reasons for the higher numbers being that W.A.K.O. had merged had recently merged with the I.K.A.S. and took on many of the I.K.A.S. organization's fighters. Another reason was that some countries were allowed multiple competitors per weight division in the Full-Contact and Semi-Contact categories.\nThere were four styles on offer in Lisbon; Full-Contact, Semi-Contact, Musical Forms and Aero-Kickboxing. By the end of the championships Russia was once again the strongest nation across all styles, with Italy in second and Hungary in third. The event was held over seven days in Lisbon, Portugal, starting on Tuesday, 24 October and finishing on Monday, 30 October.\nFull-Contact.\nFull-Contact is a form of kickboxing where the contestants can throw punches and kicks with full power at legal targets above the waist. Victories are usually gained via a point's decision or by referee stoppage and as with most other forms of amateur kickboxing, various head and body protection must be worn. More information on Full-Contact and the rule set can be accessed at the W.A.K.O. website. Both men and women had competitions at Lisbon, with the men having twelve weight divisions ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs and the women seven, ranging from 48 kg/105.6 lbs to over 70 kg/+143 lbs and unlike more recent W.A.K.O. championships some countries were allowed more than one athlete per weight division.\nThere were several repeat winners at Lisbon with Zurab Faroyan moving up in weight to win his third gold medal in a row, Konstantin Sbytov won in Full-Contact after winning in Low-Kick at the world championships in Agadir while Valeria Calabrese and Monika Florek had won at the last world championships in Szeged. Local fighter and K-1 MAX regional winner Luis Reis was probably the most recognisable name in the category but had to make do with silver. By the end of the championships, Russia were once again the strongest nation in Full-Contact, winning nine gold, three silver and seven bronze medals.\nSemi-Contact.\nSemi-Contact is a form of kickboxing where the contestants are allowed to throw kicks and punches with minimal force at legal targets above the waist. Almost all matches are won via a point's decision with the fighters scored on strikes landed using skill, speed and technique with power prohibited. Despite the less physical nature of the style as with other forms of amateur kickboxing, head and body protection must be worn. More information on Semi-Contact can be found at the official W.A.K.O. website. At Lisbon the men had nine weight divisions ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 94 kg/+206.8 lbs while the women had six, ranging from 50 kg/110 lbs to over 70 kg/154 lbs and there was also a mixed team event and unlike more recent W.A.K.O. championships some countries were allowed more than one athlete per weight division. Despite not having any household names there were a couple of repeat winners from the last world championships in Szeged, with Adriano Passoro and Gregorio Di Leo (four gold) picking up winners medals. By the end of the championships Italy beat off strong competition from Hungary to become the strongest nation in Semi-Contact, winning five golds, one silver and three silvers, while Germany won the team event.\nMusical Forms.\nMusical Forms is a type of non-physical competition which sees the contestants fighting against imaginary foes using Martial Arts techniques - more information on the style can be found on the W.A.K.O. website. Unlike other styles at Agadir there were no weight divisions only male and female competitions and competitors were allowed to compete in more than one category and some countries had more than one athlete in each category. The men and women at Lisbon competed in four different styles explained below:\nThe most notable winner in the style was Andrey Bosak who won three golds and a silver medal across the four categories he competed in. Other winners who had also won at the last world championships in Agadir included Olga Kudinova and the highly decorated Veronica Dombrovskaya. By the end of the championships Russia dominated the style, winning five golds, seven silvers and two bronzes.\nAero-Kickboxing.\nAero Kickboxing is a non-physical competition, involving participants using a mixture of aerobic and kickboxing techniques in time to specifically selected music. There are no weight divisions as with other forms of kickboxing in W.A.K.O. but there are separate male, female and team categories, with or without an aerobic step. As with Musical Forms, competitors were allowed to compete in more than one category and some countries had more than one athlete in each category. More information on Aero-Kickboxing and the rules can be found on the W.A.K.O. website. Although a fairly low profile sport, the most notable winner was Daniele De Santis who won both the men's categories as well as gaining a gold as part of the Italian team. These three gold medals helped propel Italy to the top of the leaderboard as the strongest country in Aero-Kickboxing."

The participating teams were defending champion Swift Squeeze Juice Drinks, National seniors champion Magnolia Ice Cream, Sta.Lucia Realtors, Philips Sardines, Agfa Color Films, Burger City and the storied Crispa Redmanizers, who were making a comeback from the basketball scene after a five-year absence.\nThree teams played as guest squads; El Rancho Meat Loaf of Cebu, composed of a selection from the Visayas, Asia Overseas Transport and Dansei Groom Shop.\nMagnolia swept the eliminations with a perfect 9-0 won-loss card, followed by Crispa and Swift Squeeze with six wins and three losses, Burger City and Philips with five wins and four losses, and Sta.Lucia and Asia Overseas Transport at four wins and five losses.

San Diego State has had eight head coaches since the program began competing in 1926.\nProfiles.\nJohn Hancock.\nJohn Hancock, who led the team for the 1926 season, is the first recorded coach of San Diego State.\nLee Waymire.\nLee Waymire was San Diego State's second coach, serving for the 1927 season.\nHarold G. Brucker.\nHarold was the first coach to remain more than one year, coaching the Aztecs in 1928 and 1929.\nMorris Gross.\nAfter failing to field a team in 1930, Morris Gross coached the Aztecs in 1931 and 1932.\nCharles R. Smith.\nAfter again failing to field a team in 1933, 1934, and 1935, Charles R. Smith took the program over, becoming the first San Diego State coach with an extended tenure. Smith coached the Aztecs from 1936 through 1964, with a three-year interruption from 1943 to 1945 during which time no team was fielded.\nLyle Olsen.\nLyle Olsen succeeded Smith, coaching the Aztecs from 1965 through 1971.\nJim Dietz.\nJim Dietz coached the Aztecs for 31 years, from 1972 through 2002. His record of 1230–751–18 makes him one of the winningest college baseball coaches of all time. Dietz coached a number of players who went on to successful Major League Baseball careers, including Bud Black and Tony Gwynn. He took the position at San Diego State in 1971 a week after accepting and then turning down an offer to coach basketball at Lewis–Clark Normal School—now Lewis–Clark State College.\nTony Gwynn.\nA native of Long Beach, California, and an alumnus of San Diego State, Tony Gwynn returned to coach his alma mater after the end of his 20-year Hall of Fame career. Gwynn was hired in the fall of 2001 to replace Dietz following the 2002 season.\nThe Aztecs' home field was renamed Tony Gwynn Stadium in his honor in 1997.\nMark Martinez.\nMark Martinez took over as head coach after Tony Gwynn died from cancer in 2014."

The Volunteers are currently coached by Matt Kredich. The Vols host their swim meets in the \nAllan Jones Intercollegiate Aquatic Center which was newly built in 2008. The Vols compete in the SEC where they have won 10 SEC team titles, 173 individual titles and 45 relay crowns. Over the past 75 years of competition the Vols have produced numerous All-Americans, 24 Olympians, scored in 53 consecutive NCAA Championship meets, won 45 individual NCAA titles and won 1 NCAA National Title.\nThe Vols are currently led by 12th year head coach Matt Kredich who was hired on April 12, 2012. He had previously served as the Lady Volunteer Swimming and Diving head coach beginning in 2005. He replaced long-time head coach and former UT swimmer John Trembley who was fired as head coach for embezzlement and inappropriate behavior on university grounds on January 3, 2012.\nDecade of dominance.\nWhen Ray Bussard was hired in 1968 as head coach for the Vols swimming &amp; diving team the team hadn't competed at the NCAA level since 1959 and had not ever won a team SEC championship. In only his second year as head coach Bussard won the school's first SEC title for men's swimming &amp; diving and would go on to compete in the NCAA tournament. Throughout the 1970s Tennessee owned the 400-freestyle relay at the SEC Championships winning it for ten straight years. During that ten-year span Tennessee earned five straight 800-freestyle relay titles and won the 400 medley crown nine out of 11 times. In 1978 Bussard would accomplish the biggest goal for any team by winning the 1978 NCAA championship. At the start of the championship meet the Vols jumped out to a 24-point lead on the first day of competition and would continue on winning the title. The title was not only a first for a team from the Southeastern Conference but also a first for any team in the south. When Bussard retired in 1988 he finished with a 252-20 overall record and a .926 winning percentage making him the winningest swimming and diving coach in Tennessee history. He left the school having earned NCAA Coach of the Year in 1972 and 1978, as well as SEC Coach of the Year in 1972, 1973, 1975, 1977, and 1978. In 2008 Bussard was inducted in the American Swimming Coaches Association's Hall of Fame.\nHead coaches.\nSource\nYearly record.\nSources&lt;\nNote: The 2020 season was canceled after the SEC Championships due to the Coronavirus Pandemic, the NCAA Championships were not held.\nNCAA Individual &amp; Relay champions.\nThe Vols have won 46 NCAA Individual, Relay, and Diving NCAA titles all time.\nConference Individual Event Champions.\nThe Vols have won 227 total SEC individual, relay, and diving titles throughout their history.\nTennessee Volunteers Olympians.\nThe University of Tennessee has had 24 Olympians represent Tennessee's swimming and diving program since the 1970s.

        "text": "This article details the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League qualifying phase and play-off round.\nAll times are CEST ().\nRound and draw dates.\nAll draws held at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.\nFormat.\nThere are two routes which the teams are separated into during qualifying:\nEach tie is played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that has the higher aggregate score over the two legs progresses to the next round. In the event that aggregate scores finish level, the away goals rule is applied, i.e. the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs progresses. If away goals are also equal, then 30 minutes of extra time are played, divided into two 15-minute halves. The away goals rule is again applied after extra time, i.e. if there are goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score is still level, the visiting team qualifies by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals are scored during extra time, the tie is decided by penalty shoot-out.\nIn the draw for each round, teams are seeded based on their 2011 UEFA club coefficients, with the teams divided into seeded and unseeded pots. A seeded team is drawn against an unseeded team, with the order of legs in each tie decided randomly. Due to the limited time between matches, the draws for the second and third qualifying rounds take place before the results of the previous round are known. The seeding in each draw is carried out under the assumption that all of the highest-ranked clubs of the previous round are victorious. If a lower-ranked club is victorious, it simply takes the place of its defeated opponent in the next round. Prior to the draw, UEFA may form \"groups\" in accordance with the principles set by the Club Competitions Committee, but they are purely for convenience of the draw and do not resemble any real groupings in the sense of the competition, while ensuring that teams from the same association are not drawn against each other.\nTeams.\nBelow are the 54 teams (39 in Champions Route, 15 in League Route) involved in the qualifying phase and play-off round, grouped by their starting rounds. The 10 winners of the play-off round (5 in Champions Route, 5 in League Route) qualify for the group stage to join the 22 automatic qualifiers.

        "title": "Rodney Blake (basketball)",
        "text": "Rodney Blake (born December 31, 1966) is a retired American professional basketball player. He had a standout college career at Saint Joseph's between 1984 and 1988 before embarking on a career that would take him to the Continental Basketball Association as well as leagues in over half a dozen countries. A , 220 lb. (100 kg) center, Blake led NCAA Division I in blocked shots during the 1986–87 season. He still remains one of the top shot blockers for a career in Division I history.\nEarly life.\nBlake, originally from Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania, attended Monsignor Bonner High School in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania. He made a reputation for himself playing basketball and was ranked one of the top 50 players in the country by the time he graduated in 1984. He had guided Monsignor Bonner to consecutive Catholic League titles as well. Many colleges recruited him, but Blake stayed at home and chose to attend Saint Joseph's for head coach Jim Boyle. Among other reasons, he chose Saint Joseph's because of the opportunity to get significant playing minutes as a freshman.\nCollege.\nAs he expected, Blake contributed right away for the Hawks, amassing a then-school single season record 95 blocks and being named to the All-Atlantic 10 Conference Rookie Team. Known for his defense, he also possessed a soft touch around the rim and contributed on the offensive end as well. He guided the Hawks to a second round entry in the 1985 National Invitation Tournament. The following year, Blake broke his own record by recording 121 blocks. He was named to the A-10 Conference and Philadelphia Big 5 First Teams. Saint Joseph's also qualified for the 1986 NCAA Tournament and advance to the Round of 32. As his college career began to gain momentum, Blake started receiving national recognition, and by the time he was a senior he was named to the preseason John R. Wooden Award watchlist, an honor given to the players in the country who have the most realistic chances as being the national player of the year.\nIn 1987–88, Blake led all of Division I in blocked shots per game. Publications such as \"Sporting News\", \"Street &amp; Smith's\" and \"Game Plan\" honored him with All-American status. The USBWA and NABC also selected him to their All-District First Teams. At the time of his graduation, Blake's 419 career blocked shots were the most in NCAA history, a mark that has been since surpassed. This total still ranks in the top 25 all-time, however.\nProfessional and later life.\nDespite a lauded career at Saint Joseph's, Blake went unselected in the 1988 NBA draft. Years later, he recalled how he underestimated the importance of performing well at a pre-draft camp: \"Senior year when I went down to [a pre-draft camp in] Orlando, I didn't realize how great an opportunity it was...I didn't understand that I had to 'bring it' because so many NBA scouts were there to evaluate us.\" Blake got hurt in the second game of the camp and never got to showcase his talent. After individual workouts with the Chicago Bulls and Houston Rockets, neither of which resulted in a regular-season contract, he began playing in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) with the Charleston Gunners. After a short while he moved to play in Italy for three months, then moved to Germany to continue playing as an expatriate. When that team went bankrupt, Blake moved back to the United States and re-joined the CBA for the Wichita Falls Texans.\nWith the Texans, he became a key player in helping to lead the team to the first professional basketball championship in the state of Texas' history. Even though the Texans finished second to the Tulsa Fast Breakers in the Western Division during the regular season, they went on a hot streak down the stretch into the playoffs. They defeated the Quad City Thunder, four games to three in a best-of-seven series, to take the 1991 CBA Championship.\nUncertain of the CBA's financial situation, Blake headed overseas once again. Over the next nine years, he had stints in Cyprus, Belgium, Finland, Switzerland, Argentina, and for the Chicago Rockers back in the CBA. In 2000, Blake decided to retire from professional basketball after 12 years. He now works as a math teacher in special education at John Bartram School in Philadelphia. He and his wife Shelly have one daughter, Elizabeth."

        "title": "Anthony Watson (basketball)",
        "text": "Anthony Scott Watson (born September 25, 1964) is an American former professional basketball player. He played college basketball for the San Diego State Aztecs. He led the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) in scoring in 1986, when he was named the WAC Player of the Year. Watson was named twice to both the All-WAC first team as well the All-WAC tournament Team. He finished his Aztec career with the school record for most points scored in a game (54), and left with the second-most career points (1,735) in school history.\nWatson was drafted by the Denver Nuggets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in the fourth round of the 1986 NBA draft with the 87th overall pick. He did not make the team, but went on to play professionally in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) as well as for Athletes in Action.\nEarly life.\nWatson was born in Chicago to Shirley Watson and Edward Johnson. He developed close relationships with his parents, who never married. Watson grew up for 12 years in Chicago, raised mostly by his grandmother, Oaral May Watson. She became one of the biggest influences in his life. Watson began playing basketball in Chicago, but his best memories of the city were of jumping on trains running from tracks blocks away from his home, and riding on the outside of the train to a swimming pool a few miles away. In the eighth grade, Watson moved to Detroit with his mother and her new husband, a Baptist minister, with whom Watson also developed a good relationship.\nWatson played basketball at Cooley High School in Detroit. As a senior, he averaged 31 points, 10 rebounds, and 8 assists—earning all-state honors. Most outside observers anticipated that he would play college basketball nearby at Michigan, joining Cooley teammate Roy Tarpley. However, Watson wanted to play immediately, and instead chose to move west to play at San Diego State University (SDSU).\nCollege career.\nAs a freshman with the Aztecs, Watson made his first start in the ninth game of the season, scoring 26 points in an 89–85 win over Florida State. Aztecs coach Smokey Gaines made the switch after not getting enough production from the team's senior guards. Watson started the final 20 games of the season while averaging 11.4 points. At the beginning of his sophomore year in September 1983, Watson was declared academically ineligible. While his grade point average was sufficient, he was ruled to lack \"quality points\"—used to determine whether a student is on schedule to graduate with their class—in his coursework, despite the semester of summer school he recently finished. Not allowed to take classes at SDSU, he enrolled in accelerated classes at San Diego Mesa College. Since he was no longer on scholarship, he worked at a gas station to pay for school. Busy with study and work, he had no time to play basketball. In December, he regained his eligibility, but already missed the first five games of the season. Impacted by his inactivity, he did not re-enter the starting lineup until mid-January. He shot just 39 percent while averaging 10.5 points that season, and later regretted not having redshirted.\nThe following season in 1984–85, Watson was an All-WAC first team selection after leading the team in scoring with a 17.5 average. He was twice named the WAC player of the week, and also was honored as \"Sports Illustrated\"s national player of the week. The Aztecs were 11–5 in the conference and won the WAC tournament, where Watson was named to the All-WAC Tournament Team. SDSU's season record of 23–8 was at the time their best record ever as a Division I team. They qualified for the 1985 NCAA tournament, their first invite in nine years. In their first-round loss to the UNLV Runnin' Rebels, Watson scored 19 points and had six assists.\nBefore the start of his senior season, Watson ran into teammate Creon Dorsey during practice and suffered a split in the webbing between the middle and index fingers of his right hand. The injury needed 10 stitches and had to be wrapped heavily with gauze and tape. The Aztecs started the season 0–7, and Watson was averaging around 17 points through the first five weeks. He was frustrated with his injury and the team's poor start. Furthermore, injuries to two frontcourt players forced the team to move him out of position from guard to small forward, where the Watson faced stronger players standing around . When Steffond Johnson returned to the lineup in mid-January, Watson was able to move back outside. His hand had also healed, and his play improved. He set the Aztecs' school record for most points scored in a game (54) against U.S. International University on February 20, 1986. His 22 free throws that night were also a record. Watson was again named to the All-WAC Tournament team after the Aztecs ended their season with a 78–75 loss to the UTEP Miners in the conference tournament. He finished the season as the WAC's scoring champion with a 22.5 point average, becoming the first Aztec since Kim Goetz in 1979 to lead the conference in scoring. Watson was named to the All-WAC first team and won the WAC Player of the Year. He also received honorable mention All-American honors from the Associated Press.\nWatson finished his career at SDSU as the second leading scorer (1,735) in school history behind Michael Cage, moving to third after Brandon Heath passed him in 2006. Watson also left with a school record of 702 career field goals. He was inducted into the Aztec Hall of Fame in 2015.\nProfessional career.\nWatson was drafted in the fourth round of the 1986 NBA draft by the Denver Nuggets. Though he played mostly shooting guard in college, Watson at only was projected as a point guard. He was cut by the Nuggets in training camp after they acquired another guard, Darrell Walker. He joined the La Crosse Catbirds of the CBA, entering the 1986–87 season projected as a backup point guard to Dennis Nutt. Watson was released by La Crosse on December 23, 1986. \nWatson returned to San Diego State in early 1987 to serve as a graduate assistant coach. He joined Athletes in Action in 1988."

C. Jones and Bill Russell to make San Francisco the first college to win an NCAA tournament title with three black starters in the 1954–55 NCAA men's basketball season, Perry's junior year. Hal Perry averaged 6.9 points and 1.9 rebounds per game that year.\nHis senior season, the Dons outdid themselves, going undefeated and repeating as national champions. Perry increased his scoring average to 9.1 points per game for the year and was named second team all-conference. However, when star guard Jones was declared ineligible for the 1956 NCAA tournament, coach Phil Woolpert asked Perry to take a larger role. Perry responded by averaging 14 points per game in the Final Four and joined national player of the year Russell on the All-Tournament team.\nFollowing his graduation from USF, Perry played briefly for the Harlem Globetrotters. However, Globetrotters owner Abe Saperstein told Perry he was too smart for the barnstorming life and offered to pay his way to law school. Perry took him up on his offer and went to Lincoln Law School. He ran a successful private practice for many years.\nPerry died on April 30, 2009, after a long illness."

Making their debut against the Czech Republic in July 2011, they played their first ranked international against Greece in October 2013.\nHistory and setting up.\nMagyar Bulls RLFC, Hungary's National Rugby league team was founded in Budapest in May 2011 by members of the Budapest Exiles RFC, keen to try rugby league and with an open invitation to other teams in Hungary to send players - all with the objective of honouring an invitation to play in the CEE European Bowl competition vs. the Czech Republic.\nFrom small beginnings on a Monday evening, on Margit Island, in the middle of the Danube, the squad has grown to be able to select a nucleus of 20 players to play against the Czech Republic on 23 July. The pull of playing international RL has seen enquiries to train and play from a number of other clubs in Hungary as well as players of Hungarian origin who have travelled back to play from Italy and the UK.\nIn June 2013, Hungary was granted Observer status by the RLEF. They subsequently played their first fully sanctioned international against a Greece team featuring professional players Michael Korkidas and Braith Anasta.\nIn 2014, Tour in Paris again and Hungary competed in the inaugural Balkans Cup tournament in Serbia. This was Hungary's first International tournament. Hungary finished the overall tournament in fourth place. They also made history in the tournament, as they recorded their first ever international try in their match with Bosnia.\nIn 2015 Tour in Belgrade on Euro 9' Tournament.\nCurrent squad.\nHungary can call eligible players like Kurt Falls, Blake Mozer and Myles Gal.\nSquad selected for the 2018 Emerging Nations World Championship;\nHungarian National Rugby League in Australia.\nIn 2016, Hungary began searching for players in Australia of Hungarian heritage to play for Hungary. This was met with resounding response, with many quality players putting their name down. Several training sessions were held in Sydney by coach John Wilson and manager Stephen Németh.\nOn 4 February 2017, Hungary played their first test match outside of Europe against Uruguay who were making their International debut, in front of 500 spectators. Hungary ran away with the game 50-4 in a dominant display. The team consisted of only Australian players with Hungarian heritage. This was also Hungary's first test match victory across any continent. The four Farkas brothers were outstanding, scoring 30 of the 50 points between themselves alone, with Aaron Farkas accumulating 16 himself in a spectacular performance at hooker. Alexander Fricska scored a try on debut.\nOn 8 February 2017, just 4 days after the first test played outside of the Europe, Hungary played their second against a stronger Thailand side, featuring ex NRL and Super league coach Brian Smith, in front of 100 spectators. Hungary opened up the scoring with 2 quick tries, before scoring 2 more before the half. Thailand came out strong in the second half scoring first points, however Hungary were too strong and ran out 44-10 winners becoming just their second test match victory since the teams origin 6 years prior. The game was almost called off as the night before, a storm washed out the majority of Sydney's Rugby League fields. Just hours before kickoff, the game was rescheduled at Endeavour Sports High School, instead of the original venue, Erskineville Oval.\nResults.\nA † denotes that the match did not contribute to the RLIF World Rankings.\nCap Number and playing record.\nAs of 8 February 2017."

        "title": "Cricket in Argentina",
        "text": "Argentina is the strongest cricket country in South America except Guyana who represent the West Indies.\nHistory.\nThe first time cricket was practised in the country was during the British invasions of the Río de la Plata in 1806 and 1807. It is believed that the first cricket match was played in San Antonio de Areco by a group of British prisoners that had been caught by the criollos revolutionaries.\nBy 1831 Argentina was the country with the greatest number of British immigrants behind the Commonwealth nations. Most of them were traders or bankers who had developed their business in the Río de la Plata area. One of those businessmen was James Brittain, who owned a country house in the neighborhood of Barracas, where he organized cricket games. Brittain was also the founder of Banco de Buenos Aires, the first bank of Argentina, established during the presidency of Bernardino Rivadavia.\nDuring one of the frequent matches at Brittain's country house, it was decided to form a club. On November 5, 1831, a cricket game was played in Recoleta, Buenos Aires, near the Nuestra Señora del Pilar church. During that game, a flag with the legend \"Buenos Aires Cricket Club\" was displayed. Some historians affirm that was the current Buenos Aires Cricket &amp; Rugby Club, which would later set its foundation on 1864 although it is believed the club was established at least 30 years before.\nThe first president of the BACC was British consul Frank Parish, named in 1858. In April 1868, BACC played its first club match facing Montevideo Cricket Club (MVCC) in the city of Montevideo. BACC won by 156-124. The rematch was played in Buenos Aires in 1869, where BACC defeated Montevideo again by 174-121. That same year a new club was formed, \"Great Southern Railway Cricket Club\", established by the English workers of Great Southern Railway. The club settled its field near to Barracas (current Avellaneda) railway station, moving in 1880 to Sola station. The president of GSRCC was Edward Banfield, who was also general manager of the railway company.\nThe BACC had moved to Palermo in 1864, where the club would remain until 1948 when a fire destroyed its buildings. Due to the yellow fever epidemic that devastated Buenos Aires in 1870, much of the British residents in the city moved to suburban areas, such as Flores (that was not part of the city of Buenos Aires by then) and Lomas de Zamora among other districts. In those areas other cricket clubs, such as Chascomús Cricket Club and Adela Cricket Club, were formed.\nIn Lomas de Zamora, the Lomas Cricket Club (not to be confused with Lomas Athletic Club) was established in 1872, the same than Flores Cricket Club in Flores. In 1873 a third game between BACC and MVCC was played, ending in a tie.\nIn the rest of Argentina more cricket institutions were founded, being Córdoba, Rosario, Lomas de Zamora, Quilmes and Flores some of the most important centres for the practise of the sport. All of those clubs were exclusively for members of the British community, who contributed to keep the institutions active.\nIn BACC, the field was used for cricket during summer, and for the rest of the year it was rented for association football, rugby union and athletics. Those sports were played informally so they were not ruled by then. In 1875, the Parque 3 de Febrero was opened and the government of Argentina allowed BACC to keep its location in those land. As a retribution, the club named former president Domingo Sarmiento honorary member. In 1877 the BACC played its first match against Rosario Cricket Club. That same year, \"Caballito College Cricket Club\" was the first cricket institution founded entirely by Argentine natives (\"criollos\").\nBy 1878 Lomas CC and Flores CC had disappeared, only BACC remaining in Buenos Aires. The club organized matches played by members of the club on both sides, due to the lack of rivals from other institutions.\nThe first official competition was organized in 1897, being Lomas the champion. This was the first step to the creation of a national body, which would be finally established in 1913 with the name of \"Asociación de Cricket Argentino\".\nThe decade of the 1940s is considered the golden age of the sport in Argentina due to the arrive of professional English players contributed to improve the level of the local championship, being even compared with the English cricket. When World War II began, most of the British players joined the British Army, leaving Argentina. This caused the level of the game decreased.\nArgentine cricket celebrated its 200th anniversary on 21 October 2006. An event was held at San Antonio College, where the first recorded match was played back in 1806 by British Soldiers. The history of cricket in the country can roughly be divided into various phases. From 1806 to 1900, cricket was established in Argentina, with the first international matches played, the major clubs founded, and the great North v South contest beginning. The Buenos Aires Cricket Club in Palermo was inaugurated in 1864 and is the historical reference for cricket in the country. Now known as the Buenos Aires Cricket &amp; Rugby Club, a project is in place where cricket will once again hopefully become a practiced sport at this famous club.\nArgentina first played international cricket in 1868, against Uruguay. It was the first official contest in any sport between the two countries. International competition against Brazil dates back to 1888, and against Chile to 1893, this encounter famous for the Argentine team taking three and a half days to reach Santiago in Chile, crossing the Andes by mule. In 1891, the famous annual three-day North v South fixture was played for the very first time and is still today a highlight of the domestic calendar. The first league competition was held in 1897.\nThe Argentine Cricket Association was founded in 1913 and celebrated its centenary in 2013. 1900 to 1939 are considered the golden years where cricket reached a high standard, many players reaching English county level. Argentina played first-class matches between 1911 and 1938. The sport went into decline after World War II, until Argentina became an Associate Member of the ICC in 1974 and took part in its first ICC Trophy in 1979.\nWith the introduction of the ICC Development Programme in 1997 to the present day, there has been a steady recovery with the ACA formulating a domestic development programme with the regional support of ICC Americas. Although cricket remains a minority sport within the sporting and primarily football culture of the country, Argentina still proudly boasts a competitive record at international level, and performances over the last few years have earned respect and recognition from the rest of the cricket world.\nCompetition.\nInternational.\nA solid performance at the 2001 ICC Trophy in Canada ensured the world took note of Argentina's cricket potential, especially a stunning victory over Malaysia. The team's success at the Pepsi ICC World Cricket League Division 3 in Darwin, Australia in 2007 thrust this relatively unknown team further into the limelight, and although results have not been as positive since then in the higher reaches of Associate cricket – including a relegation campaign when hosting World Cricket League Division 3 in 2009 - Argentina is far and away the leading cricket nation in Latin America. Prior to the WCL Division 3 Series success of 2007, the Argentina national cricket team won the ICC Americas Division 2 Tournament in 2006. Argentina and Argentina \"A\" teams have traditionally been a force at South American Championships and it also maintained its status in the top-flight of a tough Americas Division One section – that also features the likes of Canada and USA - during the latest tournament that took place from 27 May – 7 June 2010 in Bermuda.\nDomestic.\nThe domestic competition in Argentina runs from late October to early April every year. The first part of the year is dedicated to the schools leagues and festivals. Senior cricket consists of the Development Cup, Third Division Championship, Second Division Championship and Saturday Championship (played by Second Division teams) for lower leagues, while at premier league level there is the Robin Stuart Shield, a Twenty20 league and the First Division Championship. A Women's First Division Championship was played for the first time in 2008. The junior leagues are played by schools and clubs, at U15 and U19 levels, and for the first time U13 leagues were played over the winter in 2008. An U11 league will begin in the winter of 2009. The annual North v South three-day match is a domestic highlight and was played for the 110th time in March 2009. Argentina also receives a number of visiting teams on an annual basis, who compete against local clubs, schools and representative teams.\nDevelopment Programme.\nArgentina's development programme looks to give opportunities and competition to every age group in the country, both domestically and internationally. On the domestic scene, Argentina has an U15 league and an U19 league. There is also the Development Cup and Third Division, which is largely made up of junior players. The winter months include U13 and U11 leagues for boys and girls. Argentina also has an annual international competition called the Pampero Festival in which our U17s compete against teams from South Africa, Australia and England. There are also an annual U15 series against Chile, while the first South American U13 championship took place in 2009.\nEducation and awareness is an important component, and coaching, umpiring and scoring courses are held in clubs and schools on a regular basis. There are also annual academies held in school vacations for various age groups targeting the most talented juniors in the local game. The ACA is also aware of its social responsibility, and a number of projects are taking place in underprivileged areas, giving young children the opportunity to play cricket.\nWomen's cricket.\nThe roots of Argentine women's cricket go back to an U15 girls tour to New Zealand in 2000, and today there is a Women's First Division competition as a direct result of that. Argentina proudly took part in the first-ever Americas Women's Championship in 2007 and have played home and away T20 series against the emerging Brazil team. In 2009, Argentina took part in the second Americas Women's Championship, as well as sending a development team to Chile to assist the growth of women's cricket there. In addition to the local first Division, the women's national team, known as the Flamingos, take part in the men's senior Second Division tournament. Junior girls leagues with schools and clubs are scheduled to begin in 2009.\nList of champions.\nPrimera División.\nThe following is a list of the Primera División champions:"

With fixtures becoming increasingly crowded, drawn matches from 1962 in quarter-finals and semi-finals would have been decided by drawing of lots. Replacement of the rules was first proposed in 1970 to the IFAB, and penalty shoot-outs were adopted for the new format of the 1978 tournament, although the replay rule for the final matches remained in place until 1982.\nIn practice, penalty shootouts did not occur before 1982. Three times, in 1994, 2006, and 2022, the Men's World Cup title has been decided by a penalty shoot-out. Of the 35 shoot-outs that have taken place in the competition, only two reached the sudden death stage after still being tied at the end of \"best of five kicks\".

By the final matchday, we’re probably going to break the [attendance] record of all the other U-17 World Cups and we might even break the record for the U-20 World Cup, which is an amazing achievement. It really shows that India is a footballing nation in every sense. The hard work put in place during so many years has received a great response from everybody. It has been a very proud moment for all of us.\"\nThe tournament was the most attended and highest scoring edition of the FIFA U-17 World Cup in history. It was also the highest attended men's age-group World Cup ever, surpassing the attendance record of the FIFA U-20 World Cup. The attendance for this World Cup was a record 1,347,133 surpassing China's 1985 edition where it was 1,230,976, and the 2011 U-20 World Cup in Colombia which was attended by 1,309,929 people.\nThe 177 goals scored during the tournament made it the highest scoring U-17 World Cup in history, surpassing the previous record of 172 during the 2013 edition in the United Arab Emirates. The 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup also recorded the highest goal average of 3.40 per match since the tournament format was expanded from 16 teams to 24 teams in 2007.\nIn September 2017, India submitted a bid to host the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup, but lost to Poland. India was selected to host the 2020 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup by the FIFA Council on 15 March 2019."

        "text": "W.A.K.O. World Championships 2003 in Paris were the joint fourteenth world championships held by the W.A.K.O. and the first ever to be held in France. The other (joint) world championships were to be held in November of the same year in Yalta, Ukraine. The event was open to amateur men and women with approximately 780 athletes from 63 countries across the world taking part.\nThere were four styles on offer at Paris; Full-Contact, Light-Contact, Semi-Contact and Aero-Kickboxing. The other W.A.K.O. styles (Low-Kick, Thai-Boxing and Musical Forms) would be held at the second event later in the year at Yalta. By the end of the championships, Russia was the strongest nation in terms of medals won, with Hungary in second and Italy in third. The event was held between five days at the Palais des Sports Marcel-Cerdan in Paris, France, starting on Tuesday, October 21 and finishing on Sunday, October 26, 2003.\nFull-Contact.\nFull-Contact is a form of kickboxing where strikes above the waist are allowed to be thrown at full force, with wins usually occurring either via knockout or by a point's decision. As with most other forms of amateur kickboxing all contestants must wear head and body protection. More information on the rules can be found at the official W.A.K.O. website. At Paris the men had twelve weight divisions ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs, while the women had seven ranging from 48 kg/105.6 lbs to over 70 kg/+143 lbs. Notable winners included a young Muamer Hukić (more commonly known as the cruiserweight boxing champion Marco Huck) who added to the gold he won at the last European championships, and Ruslan Karaev who would have a number of fights (and win several titles) with the K-1 organization. Other notable winners included Fouad Habbani who won his third straight gold medal in Full-Contact at a W.A.K.O. championships, while Olesya Gladkova, Oksana Vasilieva and Oksana Vasilieva had all won gold medals at the last Europeans. By the end of the championships, Russia was by far the strongest nation in the style, winning nine golds, four silvers and two bronze.\nLight-Contact.\nLight-Contact is a form of kickboxing that is less physical than Full-Contact but more so than Semi-Contact and is often seen as a transition between the two. Contestants score points on the basis of speed and technique over brute force although stoppages can occur, although as with other amateur forms head and body protection must be worn - more detail on Light-Contact rules can be found on the official W.A.K.O. website. The men had nine weight divisions ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 94 kg/+206.8 lbs while the women had six ranging from 50 kg/110 lbs to over 70 kg/154 lbs. Though not full of household names there were several previous winners with Dezső Debreczeni, Zoltan Dancso, Szilvia Csicsely and Nadja Sibila having picked up golds at previous events. By the end of the championships Hungary were the strongest nation in the style, winning four gold, two silver and two bronze medals.\nAero-Kickboxing.\nAero Kickboxing is a non physical competition, involving participants using a mixture of aerobic and kickboxing techniques in time to specifically selected music. There are no weight divisions like in other forms of kickboxing in W.A.K.O. but there are separate male, female and team categories, with additional events being introduced in Paris, with a male and female 'with (aerobic) step' and 'without (aerobic) step' being added. Also, unlike the contact categories, an individual country was allowed more than one competitor, with the team event even having several teams from the same country. More information on Aero-Kickboxing and the rules can be found on the W.A.K.O. website. Although the Aero-Kickboxing competitions in Paris were not well documented with many of the winners being absent from records, Italy did particularly well, winning three gold and two silver medal."

        "title": "American football in Western Pennsylvania",
        "text": "American football in Western Pennsylvania, featuring the city of Pittsburgh and surrounding areas, has had a long and storied history, dating back to the early days of the sport. All levels of football, including high school football and college football, are followed passionately, and the area's National Football League (NFL) team, the Pittsburgh Steelers, is consistently one of the sport's most popular teams. Many of the NFL's top stars have come from the region as well, especially those that play quarterback, earning Western Pennsylvania the nickname \"Cradle of Quarterbacks\".\nEarly years.\nProfessional.\nIn the early 20th century, football began to catch on in the general population of the United States and was the subject of intense competition and rivalry, albeit of a localized nature. Although payments to players were considered unsporting and dishonorable at the time, a Pittsburgh area club, the Allegheny Athletic Association, of the unofficial western Pennsylvania football circuit, surreptitiously hired former Yale All-American guard Pudge Heffelfinger. On November 12, 1892, Heffelfinger became the first known professional football player. He was paid $500 to play in a game against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. Heffelfinger picked up a Pittsburgh fumble and ran 35 yards for a touchdown, winning the game 4–0 for Allegheny. Although observers held suspicions, the payment remained a secret for years.\nA year later, Ben \"Sport\" Donnelly became the first professional football coach, when he headed up the Allegheny Athletic Association team. Meanwhile, a player assumed to be Grant Dibert of the Pittsburgh Athletic Club, signed the first known pro football contract, which covered all of the club's games for the 1893 season.\nOn September 3, 1895, the first wholly professional game was played, in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, between the Latrobe Athletic Association and the Jeannette Athletic Club. Latrobe won the contest 12–0. During this game, Latrobe's quarterback, John Brallier became the first player to openly admit to being paid to play football. He was paid $10 plus expenses to play. In 1897, the Latrobe Athletic Association paid all of its players for the whole season, becoming the first fully professional football team.\nFrom 1890 until 1900, nearby Greensburg, Pennsylvania, was the home of the Greensburg Athletic Association. The team began as an amateur football club in 1890 and was composed primarily of locals before several paid players were added for 1895. In 1894 it was discovered that the team had secretly paid formerly Indiana Normal (now Indiana University of Pennsylvania) player, Lawson Fiscus, to play football and retained his services on salary. The team was the chief rival of another early professional football team, the Latrobe Athletic Association. Aside from Fiscus, the Greensburg Athletic Association included several of the era's top players, such as: Charlie Atherton, George Barclay, Ross Fiscus, Jack Gass, Arthur McFarland, Charles Rinehart, Isaac Seneca and Adam Martin Wyant. Several of these players revolutionized the game during their playing careers. Charlie Atherton is credited with inventing the place kick, and George Barclay invented the first-ever football helmet. Meanwhile, Isaac Seneca became the first Native-American to earn All-American honors and Adam Wyant was the first professional football player to become a United States Congressman.\nIn 1898, William Chase Temple took over the team payments for the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club, a professional football team based in Pittsburgh from 1895 until 1900, becoming the first known individual football club owner. A year later in 1899, the Morgan Athletic Club, on the South Side of Chicago, was founded. This team later became the Chicago Cardinals, and now is known as the Arizona Cardinals, making them the oldest continuously operating professional football team. The Cardinals would later merge with the Steelers for one season in 1944 due to player shortages as a result of World War II, with the two teams meeting in Super Bowl XLIII over six decades later.\nThe Duquesne Country and Athletic Club would become the top pro team in the state in 1898 and 1899. In 1898 Latrobe and two players from the Greensburg Athletic Association, formed the very first professional football all-star team for a game against the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club, to be played at Pittsburgh's Exposition Park. Duquesne went on to win the game 16–0. On November 18, 1905, Latrobe defeated the Canton Bulldogs, which later became a founding member, and two-time champion, of the National Football League, 6–0.\nLater the Homestead Library &amp; Athletic Club, fielded the top pro team in the state in 1900–1901. In 1902 the top players in the area, mainly from the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club line-up, formed the Pittsburgh Stars of the first National Football League. The Stars were suspected of being financed by Barney Dreyfuss and William Chase Temple, the owners of baseball's Pittsburgh Pirates, who were at the time the dominant team in the National League. The Stars featured baseball players in the line-up including Christy Mathewson, a future Hall of Fame pitcher with the New York Giants and Fred Crolius, and outfielder with Pirates. The team won the league's only championship in 1902.\nIn 1903, Franklin, Pennsylvania, was the home of the Franklin Athletic Club. That season, the team was unofficially recognized as the \"US Football Champions\" and later won the 1903 World Series of Football, held that December at Madison Square Garden. The team included several of the era's top players, such as: Herman Kerkhoff, Arthur McFarland, Clark Schrontz, Paul Steinberg, Pop Sweet, Eddie Wood, and coach Blondy Wallace. Other early professional football teams from western Pennsylvania include; the McKeesport Olympics, Oil City Athletic Club, Pitcairn Quakers and Glassport Odds.\nIn 1933, as the oldest of nine children Art Rooney, who had been raised on the North Side of Pittsburgh, founded the Pittsburgh Steelers. Originally nicknamed the Pirates, the team later changed their name to the Steelers, to represent the city's heritage of producing steel. The Steelers' first season with a winning record came in 1942. However, they lost their first playoff game in 1947.\nCollegiate (through World War II).\nWestern Pennsylvania football at the collegiate level began in the fall of 1889 at the University of Pittsburgh, then known as the Western University of Pennsylvania (WUP). The first official collegiate game in Western Pennsylvania was played on October 11, 1890, when the Allegheny Athletic Association's defeated WUP 38–0. WUP's second game was also the first game for Washington &amp; Jefferson, a rivalry that would dominate the area through the early 20th century.\nThe region's early thirst for football was made evident when a 12,000 strong overflow crowd packed Exposition Park to watch W&amp;J defeat Duquesne Country and Athletic Club 4–0 in one of the largest crowds in Western Pennsylvania history to that point. By 1904, the region had its first undefeated football team when WUP went 10-0 while surrendering only one touchdown on the way to collectively outscoring opponents 406–5, and by 1908, WUP had adopted its present name, the University of Pittsburgh, and quickly came to be commonly referred to as Pitt. In 1910, led by coach Joseph H. Thompson and star fullback Tex Richards, Pitt went undefeated for the second time in school history, outscoring its nine opponents 282–0, causing some to proclaim it as that season's national champion. This success paved the way for Pitt rise to national prominence under legendary coach Glenn Scobey \"Pop\" Warner who would lead Pitt to national championships in 1915, 1916, and 1918; along with an additional undefeated season in 1917, while its players garnered 16 first-team All-American selections.\nDuring this era, Washington &amp; Jefferson was also competitive with some of the top teams in the nation. In 1913, the Presidents, led by Bob Folwell, team posted a 10–0–1 record and were the highest scoring team in the nation. That season featured a scoreless tie of Yale, a 100–0 defeat of Grove City College, and a 17–0 victory over Penn State that broke the Nittany Lions' 19-game winning streak, earning the entire school a day off to celebrate. Sportswriter Walter S. Trumbull of \"The New York Sun\" suggested that the Michigan Aggies, Washington &amp; Jefferson, Chicago University, and Notre Dame were the new \"Big 4 of College Football\" instead of the traditional grouping of Princeton, Yale, Harvard, and Penn. The next year, Folwell's team lost at Harvard University in front of 15,000 fans by a score of 10–9. If not for an errant kick that hit the crossbar, W&amp;J would have won the game and at least a share of the mythical national championship. That squad saved face by becoming only the seventh team to ever defeat Yale University, with a decisive 13–7 victory. The game received national press coverage, and the team received a personal note of congratulations by Theodore Roosevelt.\nIn 1918, perhaps the biggest football game yet played in the region occurred at Forbes Field when undefeated Pitt hosted unscored upon and defending national champion Georgia Tech which was then coached by the legendary John Heisman, who had previously coach for one season at W&amp;J. The game, which served as a War Charities fundraising event, was highly publicized and was played in front of many of the nation's top sports writers, including Walter Camp. Pitt dismantled Georgia Tech 32-0 and would go on to be championed as that season's best team. Another game of import occurred in 1926 when a 6–2 Carnegie Tech football team shutout Knute Rockne's undefeated Notre Dame Fighting Irish 19–0 at Forbes Field. It would be the only loss for the Irish all season and would come to be ranked as the fourth-greatest upset in college football history by ESPN.\nWashington &amp; Jefferson's 1921 team went 10-0 under coach Greasy Neale, earning them an invitation to the 1922 Rose Bowl to play the heavily favored California Golden Bears. Cal had won their season 312–33, but the W&amp;J defense held the Golden Bears' potent offense, led by Brick Muller, to no points and 2 first downs, no completed passes, and only 49 yards rushing. The game, which would be the last time a \"small school\" would play in the Rose Bowl, featured the first African-American quarterback to play in the Rose Bowl (W&amp;J's Charlie West) and the first freshman to play in a Rose Bowl (W&amp;J's Herb Kopf).\nIn 1924, former Pitt All-American Dr. John Bain \"Jock\" Sutherland took over for Warner as coach of the Pitt Panthers, an event that was soon followed by the opening of university's Pitt Stadium. Sutherland was described as \"a national hero\" in a \"Saturday Evening Post\" article, and was perhaps the most highly admired and influential coach in the history of the university. During his 15-year tenure at the university, the longest of any football coach at Pitt, he compiled a record of 111-20-12 which included 79 shutouts. Sutherland players received 24 first-team All-American selections and his teams were named Eastern football champions seven times: 1925, 1927, 1929, 1931, 1934, 1936, and 1937. During this time, Pitt appeared in four Rose Bowl games (1928, 1930, 1933, and 1937) and turned down a bid for the 1938 Rose Bowl. Sutherland's teams were named \"National Champions\" by various selectors for nine different seasons including 1925, 1927, 1929, 1931, 1933, 1934, 1936, 1937, and 1938. Of these, the University of Pittsburgh officially recognizes five of those years as national championship seasons: 1929, 1931, 1934, 1936, and 1937.\nHowever, Pitt and Washington &amp; Jefferson weren't the only teams finding their way to major bowls. The Duquesne Dukes would win the 1937 Orange Bowl 13–12 over Mississippi State and Carnegie Tech would finish sixth in the final Associated Press Poll and go to the 1939 Sugar Bowl.\nArea colleges were responsible for many innovations in the game. In 1908, Washington &amp; Jefferson became the first team in college history to be documented with uniform numbers. Other sources give that distinction to University of Pittsburgh. The first live radio broadcast of a college football game in the United States when Harold W. Arlin announced the 21-13 Pitt victory in the Backyard Brawl over West Virginia at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh on KDKA on October 8, 1921. Duquesne head coach Elmer Layden is credited with devising the system of hand signals that officials use today. The signal system was put to use for the first time on November 11, 1928, when Duquesne hosted Thiel College at Pitt Stadium. Layden was also the first coach to use two sets of uniform jerseys for home and away contests. In addition, the first nationwide television broadcast of a live sporting event, a Pitt football game against Duke at Pitt Stadium, was televised coast-to-coast by NBC on September 29, 1951.\nDespite all their success, area institutions followed the trend of many colleges across the nation and deemphasized football in the wake of World War II. Carnegie Tech and W&amp;J both deemphasized football in various sequences following the war which has resulted in both of their programs today playing in Division III. Also following the war, Duquesne dropped football as a varsity sport until it was resurrected in 1979 before moving to the Division I Football Championship Subdivision in 1993. Although Pitt also instituted policies in the late 1930s designed to de-emphasize its athletic programs, they were subsequently repealed by the mid-1940s. Therefore, Pitt is the only Western Pennsylvania collegiate program that continues to play college football at the highest level, today known as the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision.\nModern history.\nFollowing World War II, the Steelers struggled through to the late 1960s. Pitt had a resurgence in the 1950s with stars like Mike Ditka that helped it to attain off-and-on national rankings and make appearances in the Sugar (which Pitt's Bobby Grier desegregated) and Gator bowls. Pitt peaked with a number three national ranking in the final poll of 1963, but then stagnated in the later 1960s. However, both the Panthers and the Steelers—as well as baseball's Pirates—started having successful years in the 1970s as the rest of the city fell into a deep recession as a result of deindustrialization.\nIn 1969, the Steelers hired head coach Chuck Noll who strategically drafted players in order to improve the team. Three years later, in the first playoff game at Three Rivers Stadium Pittsburgh's rookie running back Franco Harris returned an errant pass that bounced off an opposing player for a game-winning touchdown in a play that later became labeled the Immaculate Reception. In 1974, the Steelers won their first Super Bowl in franchise history—a feat which they would repeat in 1975, 1978, and 1979 to become the first NFL franchise to win four Super Bowls. In 1992, Noll was succeeded by Bill Cowher, who led the franchise to its fifth Super Bowl victory in 2005. Mike Tomlin succeeded Cower and led the Steelers to an NFL record sixth Super Bowl victory in 2008. As of 2009, the Steelers have 18 members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. In October 1964, Ernie Stautner, who played on the Steelers from 1950 to 1963, became the only Steelers' player to have his number—\"70\"—retired.\nAt Pitt, University Chancellor Wesley Posvar took action to revive the football program and hired Johnny Majors from Iowa State to resurrect the program in 1973. Majors immediately upgraded the recruiting, most notably bringing in future Heisman Trophy winner Tony Dorsett. Majors' impact was immediate: in Pitt's first game with Majors as coach, the Panthers travelled to the University of Georgia where they tied Vince Dooley's Bulldogs 7-7. The excitement in the city was palpable as the Panthers improved from one win in 1972 to a 6-5-1 record in 1973. Their success earned the Panthers their first bowl bid since 1956 when they were invited to play Arizona State in the 1973 Fiesta Bowl, where they lost 28–7. The next season saw further improvement with wins at Florida State and Georgia Tech to finish 7–4. In 1975, a Sun Bowl victory over Kansas capped an 8–4 record highlighted by wins at Georgia and Notre Dame. The stage was thus set for the 1976 edition of the Panthers to make a run for the national championship.\nThe 1976 season began with the Panthers ranked ninth in the AP preseason poll. The first game was at Notre Dame, where the Irish grew the grass long on the playing field in a failed attempt to slow down Dorsett, who had burned them for 303 rushing yards the year before. Their efforts were in vain as Dorsett ran for a 61-yard touchdown on Pitt's first play from scrimmage on the way to a 31–10 win. The season continued with a 42–14 win at Georgia Tech and a 36–19 win over Miami. On October 23, the Panthers travelled to Annapolis to face Navy during which Dorsett broke the NCAA career rushing record on a 32-yard touchdown run in Pitt's 45–0 victory. Dorsett's achievement prompted a mid-game celebration in which even Navy saluted the feat with a cannon blast. Pitt next defeated eastern rival Syracuse 23–13, and on November 6, number two ranked Pitt easily handled Army while number one ranked Michigan lost to Purdue. For the first time since 1939, the Pitt Panthers were the number one ranked team in the country. The following week, they successfully defended their top rating in a close Backyard Brawl against rival West Virginia. With a record of 10–0, the Panthers headed into their regular season finale with only heated instate rival Penn State standing in the way of Pitt's national title aspirations. At a packed Three Rivers Stadium on the day after Thanksgiving, the Nittany Lions held Dorsett to 51 yards in the first half and had the game tied 7-7. Majors adjusted for the second half by shifting Dorsett from tailback to fullback, enabling him to explode for an additional 173 yards as Pitt rolled to a 24–7 victory that capped an undefeated regular season. In December, Dorsett became the first Pitt Panther to win the Heisman Trophy as the nation's best college football player. Dorsett also won the Maxwell Award, the Walter Camp Player of the Year Award, and was named UPI Player of the Year. The 11-0 Panthers accepted an invitation to the 1977 Sugar Bowl to face second ranked Georgia. Pitt defeated the Bulldogs 27-3 and was voted number one in both the final Associated Press and Coaches polls, claiming their ninth national championship. This was Pitt's first undefeated national championship since 1937. The American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) named Majors the 1976 Coach of the Year. Following this historic season, Majors returned to his alma mater, the University of Tennessee, to take the head coaching job.\nJackie Sherrill, an assistant under Majors at Pitt and the head coach at Washington State, succeeded Majors as head coach at Pitt. Under Sherrill, the winning continued with a 9-2-1 record and Gator Bowl win in 1977. An 8–4 record and Tangerine Bowl appearance followed in 1978. Sherrill stockpiled future NFL talent including Pittsburgh's own quarterback Dan Marino, Hall of Fame inductee Russ Grimm, and Outland Trophy winner Mark May. Sherrill also molded a devastating defense that was anchored at the defensive end position manned by Hall of Fame inductee Rickey Jackson and Heisman Trophy runner-up Hugh Green, who had the highest finish in the Heisman voting by a defensive player until 1997, when Michigan's cornerback Charles Woodson, who also played receiver, won the trophy. 1979 began a string of three straight seasons with 11-1 records. However, an early loss at North Carolina in 1979, a midseason loss during a driving rainstorm at Florida State in 1980, and a devastating season-ending defeat at the hands of rival Penn State in 1981 prevented those teams from clinching an AP or Coaches poll national championship. The 1981 loss to Penn State at Pitt Stadium was especially devastating, as the number one ranked Panthers had opened up a 14-0 first-quarter lead only to see an apparent Dan Marino touchdown pass intercepted in the endzone and returned for a touchdown. The Nittany Lions scored 48 unanswered points to end the Panthers' dream of a second national championship in five years. In each of these three seasons, Pitt rebounded to win a bowl game: the Fiesta, Gator, and Sugar Bowls respectively. The 1982 Sugar Bowl was highlighted by one of the most dramatic plays in Pitt history as Dan Marino hit a streaking John Brown on fourth down in the last seconds of the game for the go-ahead score against a Georgia team that featured Herschel Walker. Sherrill's teams at Pitt are considered by some to be among the most talented in Pitt and college football history. The 1980 Pitt team alone featured seven first round draft picks, 23 players who went on to start in the NFL, seven others who played in the NFL, and one player each who played in the CFL and the USFL. Bobby Bowden, legendary coach of Florida State, is quoted as saying, \"I've said it many times, in all my years of coaching, that Pitt team was the best college football team I have ever seen.\" Sherrill left Pitt in early 1982 for Texas A&amp;M, signing a then record contract worth over $1.7 million. In five seasons, Sherrill's Panthers won fifty games, lost nine, and tied one (50-9-1), which places his 0.842 winning percentage at the top of the list for all Pitt coaches, just ahead of Jock Sutherland.\nToday.\nThe Steelers are one of the NFL's most popular teams, with a fan base known as Steeler Nation. Despite the difference in high school and college football tastes, the team unites many, and is often one of the NFL's biggest ratings draws.\nSince the Dan Marino days at Pitt, the team hasn't competed for a national championship, but has appeared in major bowls and often appears in national polls. The Panthers maintain a rivalry with the West Virginia Mountaineers, and will soon resume a four-game series with another traditional regional rival, the Penn State Nittany Lions. Pitt, Penn State, Notre Dame, and West Virginia all maintain strong local followings within the Pittsburgh region.\nOutside of the NFL and college football, the city was represented by the Pittsburgh Americans of the second American Football League in 1936 and 1937. It was also briefly represented by the Pittsburgh Maulers of the United States Football League, in 1984, and the Pittsburgh Gladiators (now the Tampa Bay Storm), of the first Arena Football League from 1987 until 1990. A new Arena Football League team, the Pittsburgh Power, started play in the Consol Energy Center in April 2011.\nIn addition, Pittsburgh is home to three women's full-contact football teams: the Pittsburgh Passion, the Pittsburgh Force and the Steel City Renegades. Founded in 2002, as members of the National Women's Football Association and having played in the Independent Women's Football League, the Passion are currently members of the Women's Football Alliance. The team went 12–0 and won a national title in 2007 as members of the NWFA. A newer team, the Pittsburgh Force, were founded in 2008 and are members of the WFA. The Renegades, founded in 2009, are members of the Women's Spring Football League.\nThe \"most established area minor-league football team\" the Pittsburgh Colts are members of the North American Football League's Regional American Football League.\nHigh school football.\nHigh school football remains popular in the area, with high school games routinely drawing over 10,000 fans per game and receiving regular press coverage in the area. Schools such as McKeesport Area High School, Aliquippa, Allderdice, Beaver Falls, Brashear, Central Catholic, Jeannette, Clairton, Hopewell, Perry, Pine-Richland, North Allegheny, Woodland Hills and Gateway have all been consistent contenders for WPIAL and City League championships and even PIAA championships. Many have sent former star players onto the NFL. Aliquippa alone has sent Mike Ditka, Sean Gilbert, Ty Law, and Darrelle Revis onto successful NFL careers, with Ditka now being a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The PIAA's Western Pennsylvania region, officially known as District 7 but more commonly known by its older name as the WPIAL, has its annual high school football championships at Heinz Field.\nThe Cradle of Quarterbacks.\nThe Pittsburgh region also has developed many notable athletes that have gone on to outstanding careers in professional sports. The region has produced a multitude of NFL quarterbacks, giving Western Pennsylvania the nickname \"Cradle of Quarterbacks.\" Dan Marino, Joe Montana, Joe Namath, Jim Kelly, Johnny Unitas, Charlie Batch, Marc Bulger, George Blanda, Johnny Lujack, Jeff Hostetler, Gus Frerotte, Willie Thrower, Warren Heller, Tyler Palko, Terrelle Pryor, Alex Van Pelt, Sandy Stephens, Terry Hanratty, Mike McMahon, Major Harris, Matt Cavanaugh, Chuck Fusina, Rod Rutherford, Ted Marchibroda, Babe Parilli, John Hufnagel, Tom Sherman, Richie Lucas, Boyd Brumbaugh, Scott Zolak, Anthony Morelli, Ed Matesic, Tom Clements, Coley McDonough, Charley Seabright, Tim Levcik, and former Steelers quarterback Bruce Gradkowski all hail from within a 50-mile radius of the city."

In four sets, Federer defeated Andy Murray to win a record-equalling seven Wimbledon titles, while Murray became the first British male player to reach a Wimbledon singles final in the Open era. Williams defeated first-time Wimbledon finalist Agnieszka Radwańska in three sets to equal her sister Venus in winning five Wimbledon titles. Federer and Williams were each more than 30 years old at the time of their victories. With his, Federer reclaimed the World No. 1 ranking for the first time since June 2010, thus allowing him to equal, then to break, the all-time record of most weeks ranked at World No. 1 held by Pete Sampras. Agnieszka Radwańska, Victoria Azarenka, and Maria Sharapova were in contention for the world number 1 ranking. Since Sharapova lost in the fourth round and Radwańska was a match away from becoming the world number 1 but lost it, Azarenka continued her success as the number 1.\nPoint and prize money distribution.\nPoint distribution.\nBelow are the tables with the point distribution for each discipline of the tournament.\nPrize money.\nFor 2012, the prize money purse was increased to £16,060,000 from £14,600,000 in 2011.

        "title": "W.A.K.O. World Championships 2005 (Agadir)",
        "text": "W.A.K.O. World Championships 2005 in Agadir were the joint fifteenth world championships held by the W.A.K.O. organization and the first ever to be held in Morocco and the continent of Africa - with the other event to be held later that year in Szeged, Hungary. The championships were open to amateur men and women from across the world, with about roughly 48 countries providing around 350 athletes (although some would be denied Visas), who all attended despite initial fears about potential terrorist attacks.\nThere were three styles on offer at Agadir; Low-Kick, Thai-Boxing and Musical Forms. The other usual styles (Full/Semi/Light-Contact kickboxing) would be held at the event in Szeged. By the end of the championships regular winners Russia were once again the top nation across all styles, with hosts Morocco doing well in second thanks largely to a great performance in Thai-Boxing, with Belarus way behind in third. The event was held over seven days at the Palais des Sports in Agadir, Morocco, starting on Monday, 19 September and ending Sunday, 25 September 2005 and was watched by around 10,000 spectators. \nLow-Kick.\nLow-Kick is a form of kickboxing where punches and kicks can be thrown at an opponent with full force at legal targets. It is similar to Full-Contact kickboxing only that kicks are also allowed to be made to the opponent's lower legs and thighs. Most fights are won by point's decision victory or via a referee stoppage and as with most forms of amateur kickboxing, suitable head and body protection must be worn. More information on Low-Kick can be found on the official W.A.K.O. website. Both men and women had competitions at Agadir, with the men having twelve weight divisions ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs and the women having seven ranging from 48 kg/105.6 lbs to over 70 kg/+143 lbs. The most notable winner was future K-1 regional and pro world champion Łukasz Jarosz who had also won gold at the last European championships in Budva, while future pro world champions Eduard Mammadov and Michał Głogowski gained podium finishes. Other gold medallists who had also won at Budva included Dmitry Ayzyatulov (Full-Contact), Ruslan Tozliyan, Artur Tozliyan, Dmitri Krasichkov and Dejan Milosavljevic. Russia were easily the strongest country in the style with ten gold, four silver and four bronze across the male and female competitions.\nThai-Boxing.\nThai-Boxing, more commonly known as Muay Thai, is a type of kickboxing that allows the participants to throw punches, kicks, elbows and knees at full force to legal targets on the opponents body. Due to the physical nature of the sport, stoppages are not uncommon, although in amateur Thai-Boxing head and body protection must be worn. At Agadir both men and women took part in the style with the men having twelve weight divisions ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs and the women six, ranging from 52 kg/114.4 lbs to over 70 kg/154 lbs. There were a number of notable faces amongst the medal positions with fighters such as Faldir Chahbari, L'houcine Ouzgni and Sergei Gur all winning medals. Also of note was Djamal Kasumov who moved up in weight to add to the gold medal he had won at the last European championships in Budva. The host nation Morocco were easily the strongest country in Thai-Boxing, winning ten gold, three silver and three bronze medals across the male and female competitions. Regular winners Belarus did very poorly by her standards only picking up one gold as well as a smattering of silver and bronze medals.\nMusical Forms.\nMusical Forms is a type of non-physical competition which sees the contestants fighting against imaginary foes using Martial Arts techniques - more information on the style can be found on the W.A.K.O. website. Unlike other styles at Agadir there were no weight divisions only male and female competitions. The men and women at Agadir competed in four different styles explained below:\nThe most notable winners in Musical Forms were Ashley Beck and Veronica Dombrovskaya who won golds medals in two different styles and both having won golds at previous W.A.K.O. championships. By the end of the event the most decorated nation in Musical Forms was Russia who dominated the medal positions by winning three gold, six silver and four bronze medals."

        "text": "Blake Jonathan Davis (born December 22, 1983) is an American former professional baseball infielder and outfielder, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Baltimore Orioles in 2011.\nEarly life.\nHigh school.\nDavis attended Fountain Valley High School in Fountain Valley, California. Competing in the vaunted California Interscholastic Federation (CIF), he primarily played shortstop and led the school in hits and assists.\nAs a senior, Davis earned first-team All-Sunset League, second-team All-Orange County, and second-team All-CIF honors. That year, he batted .376, while posting 14 stolen bases, in helping the Barons to the league title and the CIF quarterfinals. Davis had already achieved a first-team all-league and second-team all-county pick as a junior, when he hit .459 and set single-season school records for hits (45) and assists (83).\nCollege.\nDavis played college baseball for California State University, Fullerton. In 2003 (his freshman year), he was granted a redshirt season.\nIn 2004, Davis played shortstop in 41 games (32 of them as a starter). He hit .295 on the year, collecting 10 multiple-hit games, including two three-hit games, where he collected four runs batted in (RBI) — one on Apr. 9 vs. Pacific and the other in the Regional-clinching win over Pepperdine on June 6. Davis had a six-game hitting streak from Mar. 13 to Mar. 24, hitting .381 (8-for-21) over that span. He was 16-for-46 (.348) with runners in scoring position (RISP) and collected 13 of his 21 RBI with two outs. Davis also led the team with a .600 average (9-for-15) when leading off an inning.\nIn 2005, Davis emerged as the full-time Titan shortstop. He played in 62 games (starting 51) and hitting a majority of the time in the leadoff spot. Davis hit .325 on the year, good for third-best on the team, and 15th in the Big West Conference. He was ranked fifth in the conference with 50 runs scored and second with eight triples (ranking second all-time in single-season triples, in Fullerton’s record book). Davis led the Titans with 17 stolen bases (in 19 attempts), finishing just behind Cal Poly's Brandon Roberts (20) for the top conference spot. Davis also matched his career-high two home runs in 2005 (one of which was his first-ever grand slam on Feb. 27 at UNLV). Davis’ longest hitting streak lasted seven games (from May 22 to June 6), where he hit .358 (10-for-28) over that span. Davis tallied 20 multiple-hit games, collecting three hits on eight occasions and four hits on May 1, where he went 4-for-5, with 4 RBI, while scoring four runs against UC Santa Barbara. Davis tied a career-high with four RBI on two occasions (Feb. 27 vs. UNLV and May 1 vs. UC Santa Barbara). He moved over to play as a second baseman for an injured Justin Turner in two games, on April 8–9. Davis tallied a team-high 8 assists on May 3 vs. San Diego State. He earned first-team All-Big West recognition and was also a member of the Fullerton Regional all-tournament team. Davis earned second-team, ABCA/Rawlings West Region honors. He was drafted in the 46th round (1,377th overall) by the Cleveland Indians in the 2005 Major League Baseball draft, but elected not to sign.\nIn July, 2005 Davis became the Titans' 15th player to play with the US National team. While playing with the US National team, he started 16 games (playing in 20 games overall), hit .275, with two triples, and four RBI. He had two stolen bases (on four attempts). Davis also led the team in assists with 58.\nIn 2006, Davis played in 64 games, while hitting .351 on the year. He had 15 stolen bases (in 22 attempts), 13 doubles, 5 triples, and his collegiate career-high 5 home runs. Davis also had 39 RBI on the year.\nProfessional baseball.\nMinor leagues.\nDavis was drafted in the 4th round (115th overall) of the 2006 Major League Baseball draft by the Baltimore Orioles, becoming Cal State Fullerton's highest MLB draft choice that year.\nAlthough Davis had played shortstop almost his entire career, he was moved to right field for the 2011 season with Triple-A Norfolk and played about 70% of the time at that position.\nMajor leagues.\nOn June 18, 2011, Davis got his chance when he was called up to the major leagues, to replace Ryan Adams. On August 13, 2011, while playing at Camden Yards against the Detroit Tigers, Davis hit his first (and only) MLB home run, after umpire review: Crew chief Jeff Nelson watched the\nreplay and upheld the call.\nIndependent leagues.\nDavis signed with the Independent League Long Island Ducks for the 2015 season. He became a free agent after the 2015 season.\nPersonal life.\nDavis’ parents are Samuel and Cynthia Davis; he has one older brother (Bryan) and one older sister (Crissy). Blake Davis majored in Communications while at Cal State Fullerton. He has two different colored eyes. Davis lists God as his greatest influence in life. Davis married his high school sweetheart, Rayanne Bearden, on November 13, 2010."

        "title": "2002 Scottish Challenge Cup final",
        "text": "The 2002 Scottish Challenge Cup final, also known as the Bell's Cup final for sponsorship reasons, was an association football match between Brechin City and Queen of the South on 20 October 2002 at Broadwood Stadium in Cumbernauld. It was the 12th final of the Scottish Challenge Cup since it was first organised in 1990 to celebrate the centenary of the Scottish Football League.\nBoth teams progressed through four knock-out rounds to reach the final. The match was Brechin City's first national cup final in its 96-year history whilst it was Queen of the South's second appearance in the final of the tournament having lost in 1997. The tournament was contested by clubs below the Scottish Premier League; Queen of the South from the First Division and Brechin City from the Second Division.\nQueen of the South dominated most of the game with John O'Neill scoring the first goal in the 33rd minute. Two minutes into the second half, Derek Lyle scored a header to take a 2–0 lead. Brechin City had few chances to score and Queen of the South held on to win the tournament and a national cup competition for the first time.\nRoute to the final.\nThe competition is a knock-out tournament and in 2002 was contested by the 30 teams that played in the First, Second and Third Divisions of the Scottish Football League. Teams were paired at random and the winner of each match progressed to the next round and the loser was eliminated. The first round was contested by 28 of the teams and two received random byes into the second round.\nBrechin City.\nBrechin City entered the first round and were drawn to play Elgin City of the Third Division at Borough Briggs. Elgin took the lead in the 31st minute with a goal from David Ross but was short-lived; Chris Templeman equalised the score to 1–1 ten minutes later and Marc Millar scored early in the second half to give Brechin a 2–1 lead. Two minutes later, Templeman scored his second goal of the game and Charlie King concluded the win with a goal in the 90th minute to make it 4–1 and progress to the next round. Brechin played First Division club St Johnstone in the second round at home at Glebe Park. Grant Murray scored first for St Johnstone after seven minutes to take a 1–0 lead. Roddy Grant equalised for Brechin against his former club on 35 minutes before Peter MacDonald scored for St Johnstone to regain a 2–1 lead two minutes before half time. Brechin scored two goals in the second half; an own goal by Darren Dods and a second goal from Grant to produce a \"shock\" 3–2 win and advance to the quarter-finals.\nIn the quarter-finals, Brechin faced another home game against a First Division club, this time against Falkirk. The score was 0–0 for most of the game before Falkirk took the lead with only three minutes left to play with a goal from Craig McPherson. However, Brechin scored one minute before the end through Kevin Fotheringham to force extra time. The score remained equal after extra time so the winner was decided by a penalty shoot-out; Brechin winning 5–3. With four clubs left in the tournament, Brechin were drawn against Third Division club Queen's Park at Hampden Park. Queen's Park scored first through James Allan after 26 minutes but Brechin equalised before half time with a goal from Marc Millar. The rest of the game's five goals came during a nine-minute period in the second half; Brechin took a two-goal lead courtesy of Chris Jackson and Kevin Fotheringham to make the score 3–1 before goals from John Gemmell and Jonny Whelan for Queen's Park and Roddy Grant for Brechin made the scoreline 4–3 in favour of Brechin. Both teams had chances to score again before the end but the score stayed the same ensuring Brechin qualified for the first national cup final in the club's history.\nQueen of the South.\nQueen of the South also entered the first round and were drawn to play Third Division club Peterhead away from home at Balmoor Stadium. Queen of the South dominated the majority of the game and scored two late goals in the second half from John O'Neill and Peter Weatherson to progress to the next round as 2–0 winners. In the second round Queen of the South played another Third Division club, Greenock Morton, at home at Palmerston Park. The game was marred with incidents with Dean Keenan, Colin Reilly and Alex Williams all being sent off for Greenock Morton. Sean O'Connor scored the winning goal for Queen of the South with only seven minutes left to play but shortly before the end sustained an injury from a tackle by Reilly which resulted in his sending off. Queen of the South won the game 1–0 and advanced to the quarter-finals.\nIn the quarter-finals, Queen of the South played Second Division club Dumbarton, also at Palmerston Park. John O'Neill scored his second goal of the tournament to give Queen of the South the lead after 25 minutes. Dumbarton had opportunities to score an equaliser for the remainder of the game but were denied by the home team's goalkeeper, Colin Scott. Despite Dumbarton's efforts, Queen of the South sealed the victory with a goal from Derek Lyle in the final minute of the match to win 2–0 and progress to the semi-finals. With four teams left in the tournament, Queen of the South travelled to Love Street to face fellow First Division club St Mirren. Paul Shields scored first for Queen of the South in the seventh minute but was cancelled out five minutes later with a goal from Brian McGinty to make it 1–1 before Derek Lyle put Queen of the South back in front shortly before half time. Early in the second half, both teams scored again; Martin Cameron for St Mirren and Steve Bowey for Queen of the South to make the scoreline 3–2 to the away team. With ten minutes left to play, Gerhard Fellner equalised for St Mirren to make it 3–3 but late goals in the final two minutes from a Peter Weatherson free kick and Shields' second goal of the game won the match 5–3 and sent Queen of the South into the final for the second time in its history.\nPre-match.\nVenue.\nThe 2002 final was hosted at Broadwood Stadium in Cumbernauld which had been Clyde's home since it was opened in 1994. The stadium hosted the final on three previous occasions; twice in the past two seasons and for the first time in 1996. The venue had a capacity of 8,000 and 4,500 tickets were allocated to Queen of the South who had a larger fan base and average home support than Brechin City, who were allocated around 2,500 tickets. Dumfries-based Queen of the South travelled approximately to the venue whereas Brechin City travelled around .\nAnalysis.\nIn order to reach the final, both Brechin City and Queen of the South played two matches at home and two away. Brechin scored twelve goals and conceded seven compared with Queen of the South's ten goals scored and only three conceded. Queen of the South kept a clean sheet in the first three rounds&lt;ref name=\"Soccerbase_2002/03\"&gt;Scottish League Challenge Cup 2002/03, \"soccerbase.com\", Retrieved 15 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and were favourites to win the match being the higher ranked club as a competitor in the First Division, one tier above Brechin who were in the Second Division. At the time of the final Queen of the South were in bad league form, ranking second-last in the First Division with only two wins and eight points from 10 games. Brechin were in slightly better form, ranking 6th in the Second Division with four wins and 13 points from nine games before the cup final.\nBrechin and Queen of the South were both aiming to win their second trophy in less than six months, having been crowned champions of the Third and Second Divisions respectively the previous season. Despite recent league success, Brechin had never reached the final of a national cup competition in its 96-year history whilst Queen of the South were making only their second appearance in a cup final since losing the 1997 final to Falkirk in the same competition.\nMatch.\nFirst half.\nQueen of the South started the game as the livelier team, pushing forward early on; however, Brechin City had the first goal scoring opportunity of the final when Graham Gibson's long range shot was saved by Queen of the South goalkeeper Andy Goram. Peter Weatherson had a similar opportunity for Queen of the South after a pass from Derek Lyle but was also saved by Brechin's goalkeeper, David Hay. Hay made another save 10 minutes later after another Weatherson attempt from Steve Bowey's pass. After 28 minutes, Brechin player Chris Jackson was booked for a foul on Bowey and Queen of the South scored the first goal of the game shortly after in the 33rd minute but with controversy; John O'Neill rebounded the ball into the goal after Bowey's initial shot was saved by the goalkeeper but Brechin defender Greg McCulloch claimed to have cleared the ball off the line, however, referee John Underhill awarded the goal. Weatherson almost scored again shortly before half time when he headed the ball into goalkeeper Hay's hands after a Robbie Neilson cross.\nSecond half.\nFrom the beginning of the second half the match was dominated by Queen of the South and they extended their lead after only two minutes. Defender Andy Aitken made a long pass to Joe McAlpine who crossed the ball from the left to the unmarked Derek Lyle near the six-yard box who headed the ball past the goalkeeper to score his third goal of the tournament. Brechin made the first substitution of the match three minutes after the second goal, replacing Graham Gibson with Chris Templeman. Brechin's best chance of the game came in the 58th minute when Charlie King's 20-yard shot forced goalkeeper Goram to make his first proper save of the match. In the 62nd minute, Brechin made their last substitution with Marc Millar replacing Paul Riley in the midfield. With three minutes left to play, Queen of the South had an opportunity to extend their lead further when Sean O'Connor's attempted header was hit wide from a corner kick by McAlpine.\nPost-match.\nQueen of the South goalkeeper Colin Scott, who had played in all rounds before the final, was ruled out of playing because of injury. However, manager John Connolly stated that he would not have played Scott even if he had been fully fit and opted with Andy Goram instead, saying: \"I was not convinced of Colin's fitness\", and \"I told Colin there was never a chance of him playing in the Cup final\". As a result of Goram's inclusion in the squad, he became the first player to win every domestic trophy in Scotland.\nThe match remains Brechin City's only appearance in a major national cup final. However, Queen of the South have made two further appearances in the final of the tournament since the match; losing to Ross County in 2010 and beating Partick Thistle in 2013. Queen of the South also reached the final of Scotland's main cup competition, the Scottish Cup in 2008, losing to Rangers."

With his loss to Djokovic in the final, Nadal ended his 20-match Wimbledon winning streak dating back to 2008, having missed the 2009 championships due to injury.

He graduated in 1921.\nIn May 1921, the Loyola University New Orleans hired Flynn as its athletic director and football coach. He was tasked with starting up an athletics program at the school, and he coached the football team in its inaugural season in 1921. Although the Associated Press described the first season as \"unsuccessful\", Flynn improved the team incrementally over his next two years. In 1923, Loyola compiled a 5–1–1 record. After three seasons at the helm, Flynn stepped down as coach and was replaced by Moon Ducote.\nIn 1934, he became the head football coach at Morristown High School in Morristown, New Jersey, a post he held until his death. A resident of Morristown, Flynn died on October 9, 1958, at Morristown Memorial Hospital."

At the youth level, there were 13 teams and over 200 registered players in 2009. Hockey is played mostly at the youth level owing to the Romanian Olympic and Sports Committee's support of the sport for those aged under 18. However, because of the expenses and lack of investors' interest, there are currently no senior teams or competitions.\nField hockey was also played in the 20th century in Romania, but it disappeared during the communist regime in the 1960s.\nThe Romanian hockey national team plays regularly in competitions such as the Balkan Championships and the European Championships. \nLocal clubs and teams.\nSome of the hockey teams that play at this level are CSS Târgu-Mureş, CSS 2 Bucharest, Antilopa Bucharest, Rapid Bucharest, Hockey System Bucharest, CSS Odorheiu Secuiesc."

        "title": "GAA Handball",
        "text": "GAA Handball Ireland (Irish: Liathróid Láimhe C.L.G. na hÉireann) is the governing body for the sport of Gaelic handball in all of its codes in Ireland. Handball is one of the four Gaelic games organised by the Gaelic Athletic Association.\nIts headquarters is located in Croke Park, Dublin. There are approximately 200 handball clubs in Ireland.\nThe national committee of GAA Handball is Ard Comhairle (the central council) on which the president sits as chairperson. As in the parent organisation, the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), the president is elected every three years. Joe Masterson held the role of President from 2017-2020. Dessie Keegan then took over from Masterson and served as President of the organisation from 2020-2023. Conor McDonnell took over from Keegan in February 2023 and will serve as president until 2026. Tom Moloney, who was appointed in an interim capacity in January 2022, was succeeded by David Britton as manager in Autumn 2022.\nCodes.\nGAA Handball oversees four forms or codes of Gaelic handball, two domestic:\nand two international as played in Ireland:\nHistory.\nSince its foundation in 1884, the charter of the Gaelic Athletic Association has included handball as one of the sports to be promoted by the association. In 1924, the \"Irish Handball Council\" (rebranded as GAA Handball in 2009) was established to promote and develop the game.\nFrom the 1940s to the 1970s, handball was popular in the Republic of Ireland. As years went by, handball lost its popularity. Since the re-branding of the Irish Handball Council in 2009 to GAA Handball, the sport has seen an increase in popularity including through the organisation's promotion of the One Wall code in schools. As part of this initiative, several hundred one-wall courts have been built in schools across Ireland. In 2012 Ireland hosted the World Handball Championships in the Citywest International Events Arena in Dublin, where a multi-court complex was erected to host the greatest International Handball event in history, with over 30 countries and 2,000+ competitors in attendance.\nDuring the 2012 World Handball Championships, a new unified International Federation for the sport worldwide was established, the World Wall Ball Association (WWBA).\nNational and international competitions.\nIrish competitions.\nThere are many handball competitions that are run in Ireland. In 40x20, the main competitions are County, Province, and All-Ireland Championships plus the 40x20 Irish Nationals. In 60x30 Softball and Hardball. The main competition levels are County, Province, and All-Ireland Championships. In 2011 GAA Handball Ireland launched the 60x30 Nationals and this competition was held in July. In One-Wall handball, the main competition in Ireland is the Irish One-Wall Nationals, and this has been held in Breaffy House Sports Arena, Castlebar, since 2009. Competitions are also held during the year by various handball clubs around the country.\nInternational competitions.\nAs with the Irish competitions, there are many international one-wall and 40x20 competitions, the main one being the World Handball Championships which are run every 3 years. In 2012, the 'Worlds' was held in Ireland, in the Citywest International Events Arena in Dublin. The 2015 competition was held in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The two codes of handball played in the World Handball Championships are 40x20 small court and One-Wall. In the 2009 World Handball Championships, players from Ireland won the 40x20 Senior Men's Singles (Paul Brady), Ladies Senior Singles (Aisling Reilly) and Ladies Doubles competitions (Fiona Shannon, Sibeal Gallagher).\nNational Handball Centre.\nGAA Handball were granted planning approval in late 2017 to build a National Handball Centre at Croke Park.\nAs of February 2019, the centre was under development. The centre, located at the southeast corner of the stadium on Sackville Avenue, was close to completion as of early 2021, with the final minor stages of building delayed due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. The new centre contains three 4-Wall handball courts - including a three sided glass wall show court with amphitheatre style seating for a capacity of 500 spectators, a Softball show court with seating capacity for 200 spectators and three 1-Wall courts. It also contains offices for GAA Handball staff, a bar and cafe, and a community centre. The centre was used as a testing centre by Ireland's national health service, the Health Service Executive, during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWhile the centre's official opening was delayed due to both the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the final completion of remaining building works, the centre had a 'soft' opening in December 2021, allowing registered players to book the courts through Croke Park. The first competitive One-wall handball match took place in the centre in December 2022 during the European 1-Wall Tour \"EliteStop\" held in the Centre on Saturday 10 and Sunday 10 December 2022. The first competitive Four-wall handball matches to be played in the new centre are due to take place on Sunday, 2 April 2023 from 10am with the All-Ireland 4-Wall Senior Doubles semi-finals taking place in both Men's and Ladies codes.\nMedia coverage.\nIn late 2010, GAA Handball announced that it was to launch a new TV show on TG4 featuring highlights of the biggest competitions that were held over the preceding months. In mid to late December of that year, TG4 premiered the first ever edition of the GAA Handball show and it was followed by a six-part series that was broadcast in January 2011. Following the broadcast of these six episodes, a new series, of 8 episodes, was broadcast from January 2012. Further television coverage was shown on RTÉ, TG4, TV3 and Sky Sports for the 2012 All Ireland 40x20 Open Championships and for the 2012 World Championships."

        "title": "Cycling in Canada",
        "text": "Cycling in Canada is experienced in various ways across a geographically huge, economically and socially diverse country. Among the reasons for cycling in Canada are for practical reasons such as commuting to work or school, for sports such as road racing, BMX, mountain bike racing, freestyle BMX, as well as for pure recreation. The amount and quality of bicycle infrastructure varies widely across the country as do the laws pertaining to cyclists such as bicycle helmet laws which can differ by province.\nHistory.\nInterest in early Velocipede bicycles exploded during the winter of 1868–69 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada as evidenced by advertisements. The first person in North America to ride a Penny Farthing style bicycle was Albert Lane who in Montreal rode an imported 50 inch Coventry on July 1, 1874. He also co-founded the first bicycle club in Canada, the Montreal Bicycle Club in 1878 which later joined with the Lacrosse and Snowshoe clubs to form the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association in 1881.\nSome of the earliest commercial bicycle manufacturing in Canada took place in Ontario in the 1880s. One of the earliest manufacturers was Semmens, Ghent and Company of Burlington, Ontario, which began production as early as 1882. Homemade bicycles, however, are recorded as far back as the 1860s, and in 1878 it is recorded that Perry Doolittle (later the founder of the Canadian Wheelman's Association) had a wooden bicycle built for him. By the 1890s, bicycles were also being built by Massey-Harris Limited, a domestic agricultural machinery manufacturer, who based their bicycles on the Columbia bicycle that was being produced in the United States. Similarly, the Berlin and Racycle Manufacturing Company of Kitchener, Ontario (then known as Berlin) produced a Canadian copy of the Racycle under patent, a safety bicycle design being produced by the Middletown, Ohio-based Miami Cycle and Manufacturing Company.\nBefore the widespread adoption of private automobiles, bicycles were a popular mode of transport in Canada, although Canada's snowy winters posed a problem for year-round use. Travel by horse and carriage (or sled) or streetcar offered a more robust alternative. As Canada became more suburban after World War II, cars became the principal mode of transportation for many people, and cycling shifted to being solely for sport or recreation.\nIn the 1970s a bike boom saw a sharp increase of bicycle sales in Canada The advent of the mountain bike in the later twentieth century made off-road recreational bicycling particularly popular.\nIn the twenty-first century, with longer and longer commute times between suburbs and central business districts, there has been a trend towards urbanization, with people moving into cities. together with gentrification, this has created a more dense urban environment less like the mid-century North American norm and more like Old World cities where cycling commuting is more popular. This has led to a new era of cycling advocacy and can create conflicts with motorists over road space prioritization, funding and planning decisions at the local municipality level.\nCommuter cycling.\nBicycle commuting to work has grown in popularity due to a grassroots cycling advocacy movement across Canada along with improvements to bicycling infrastructure in cities. Bicycling infrastructure has an impact on the perception of risk and safety which may impact the likelihood that people will commute by bicycle.\nTop Commuting by Bicycle Census Metropolitan Areas in Canada.\nFor the 2016 Census Journey to Work data noted that the number of people living in Census Metropolitan Areas commuting by bicycle has increased by 87.9 percent, which is more than twice the pace of overall commuter growth. Canada's overall percent of bicycle commuters from the 2016 census was 1.4 percent. Victoria has a very mild climate year-round compared to the rest of Canada which may help explain why the proportion of cycling commuters is so much higher, coupled with a compact core, regional trails connecting suburbs to the downtown, a growing protected bicycle lane infrastructure, and a strong bicycle culture. Victoria is home to one of Canada's earliest Bike to Work events that has grown into the popular bicycle commuting campaign in British Columbia known as Go by Bike BC (formerly Bike to Work Week BC) which occurs in May, October and February each year and pits workplace and school based teams in friendly competition with other teams in their community for a variety of prizes.\nIn Toronto, the country's largest city, and the city with the longest average commutes in all of North America, cycle-commuting has quickly gained popularity. In 2010, however, Toronto had the highest per capita rate of bike-car collisions of any Canadian city and bike activists have demanded more bike lanes to make cycling safer. This was derided as \"the war on the car\" by successful mayoral candidate Rob Ford in the 2010 election. He was supported by media personality Don Cherry's rant against \"the pinkos out there who ride bicycles\" at Ford's inauguration. In July 2011, Toronto City Council voted to remove three of the bike lanes added by the previous council and most were removed the following year, the Jarvis bike lane was removed by Fall 2012 despite protesters. However, Toronto is not the only city in Canada to grapple with cyclist-motorist conflicts driven by unsafe or non-existent infrastructure for cycling.\nRecreational cycling.\nThe bicycle-friendliness for cycling in Canada varies considerably by region. There are thousands of kilometers of bike lanes or paths in Canadian cities. Many multi-use trails connect cities and suburbs on old railway right of ways, known as rails to trails. Rural bicycling is quite popular in less-remote areas using the many low-traffic rural roads or wide shoulders on rural roads. A long distance multi-use trail that will have many sections for cycling, is slated to be completed in 2017, see Trans Canada Trail. There are also predetermined recreational cycle routes such as the Golden Triangle. It is not uncommon to see people cycling across Canada on the shoulder of the Trans Canada Highway. Most of Canada's northern landmass completely lacks any bicycle infrastructure.\nIn comparison to Europe, Canadian cities are not very bike friendly. Canadian cars and trucks are larger with more blind spots that prevent drivers from safely seeing cyclists and pedestrians. Cities also have higher speed limits and urban highways travel in or near the core of many cities. There is also many on-street parking which can present more door zone hazards for cyclists and many Canadian cities have only begun to build more protected bike lanes in the last several years. Consequently, some inexperienced cyclists will use a \"pedestrian\" style of riding where no cycling facilities exist in order to feel safer such as by riding on the sidewalk, rather than on the roadway. Although cycling on the sidewalks is not allowed in many Canadian cities – as bicycles are often deemed to be vehicles under the laws of all provinces – it is a common cycling method in small town and suburban Canada (where pedestrians on sidewalks are rare). Canadian cycling advocates typically favour cycling facilities like bike paths and protected bike lanes that provide a buffer between motor vehicles and cyclists. Protected bike lanes or cycle tracks have been adopted in strategic corridors in Montreal, Vancouver, Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton, Saskatoon, Victoria and Ottawa with plans to add protected bike lanes in many other cities across the country wanting to increase rates of active transportation.\nIn 2011, the province of Nova Scotia passed a law requiring all motor vehicles to give cyclist of clearance to protect people riding on the shoulder. The narrow streets of Downtown Halifax were originally designed for horse, cart and bicycle and they thus require drivers to share the road with a mix of other users. The city is small and reasonably easy to navigate by bicycle as infrastructure is gradually improved each year.\nSport cycling.\nSport cycling is a minority sport in Canada. Various disciplines are practiced across the country to different degrees. In Quebec older, disciplines like road racing and track cycling are popular, although they also have smaller following in English Canada). Newer \"extreme\" disciplines like bicycle motocross, cross-country cycling, downhill mountain biking and freeride are relatively popular in areas with the appropriate facilities. Many ski hills and resorts in Canada are converted to downhill biking in the summer months. Mountain biking in British Columbia is quite popular, in particular freeride originated on the North Shore near Vancouver.\nTwo Canadians have been Olympic gold medalists in cycling: Lori-Ann Muenzer, who won the Women's sprint in Athens in 2004, and Kelsey Mitchell, who won the same event at the 2020 Tokyo Games. Canada's first winner of one of road racing's three most prestigious Grand Tours was Ryder Hesjedal in 2012. Two Canadians have worn the yellow jersey in the Tour de France: Alex Stieda (who led the race in 1986) and Steve Bauer (who won the opening stage of the 1988 Tour - the first Tour stage win for a Canadian - led the race for five days, and eventually finished fourth overall). Bauer was also the first Canadian to win an Olympic medal in road racing, finishing second in the road race at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, before taking a bronze at the Road World Championships in Barcelona later that year. At the 2022 Tour de France, Hugo Houle became the second Canadian winner of a Tour stage, 34 years after Bauer, who guided Houle to the win as his team's \"directeur sportif\".\nCycling by area.\nThe amount of purpose-built cycle facilities varies widely across Canada. Planning and construction of bike lanes is done by municipal governments who often rely on grants or funding for bicycle infrastructure from the provincial and federal government.\nAlberta.\nCalgary.\nCalgary's report showed that from 1999 to 2010, there consistently were 9,200 weekday cycling trips entering or leaving the CBD. In 2010, Calgary had 712 kilometers of multi-use pathways and 355 kilometers of on-street bikeways, 328 kilometers of which were signed bikeways and 27 kilometers of which were bikeways with pavement marking — bike lanes and marked shared lanes.\nIn 2015, Calgary has launched a strategic protected bicycle infrastructure plan that has been lauded for its ambition by cycling advocacy organization People for Bikes.\nEdmonton.\nEdmonton presently operates 117 km of on-street bike routes (12 km of marked bike lanes, 105 km of signed but unmarked bike routes), plus 275 km of routes shared with pedestrians (including sidewalks and 160 km of paved multiuse trails), and 450 km of unpaved trails; 500 km of new bike lane and paths is planned to be added from 2009 to 2019.\nBritish Columbia.\nThe province of British Columbia offers Active Transportation Infrastructure Grants for indigenous and local governments to fund network planning and infrastructure for all ages and abilities active transportation projects.\nVancouver.\nVancouver operates a total of 400 km total bikes routes, of which 330 km are on-street bike lanes. The municipal government plans to upgrade or build 23 biking routes between 2018 and 2022. Cycling is the fastest growing mode of transportation in Vancouver. Translink data indicates that cycling has increased by 40 percent in Vancouver between 2008 and 2011.\nStatistics collected show that the protected bike lanes serve thousands of cyclists every month, even in the wet winter months. Over 1 out of 8 of its lanes, bikeways and paths was a separated lane. Many of Vancouver's protected bike lanes are separated from traffic by self-watering planters that feature hardy plants that can withstand the wet winters and dry summers. The Downtown Vancouver Business Improvement Association initially did not support the separated bike lanes that were installed on Hornby and Dunsmuir streets but have since come to accept them, noting that businesses have adapted and the lanes bring a lot of people to the area.\nVancouver promotes cycling to events in the city by suggesting bicycle valet services to event organizers. These bicycle valet services that are usually no cost for cyclists but corral bikes for event coordinators while providing bike owners with a secure place to store their bike under watchful volunteers while they visit the event.\nIn summer 2016 Vancouver started its own bicycle-sharing system known as Mobi by Shaw Go. Mobi faced initial planning challenges with the province of British Columbia's mandatory helmet law that is required for all ages and the placement of docking stations away from existing bike rental locations that cater to tourists.\nVictoria.\nVictoria has the highest rate of commuters who bicycle to work in Canada. This may be in part due to a mild year-round climate, a relatively flat and compact core and separate municipalities for the suburban areas resulting in perhaps less animosity towards dedicated infrastructure for cycling. The city has 41 km of bike lanes with 775 km in the Capital Regional District. Victoria's regional trails connect the downtown core with suburban municipalities along the Galloping Goose Regional Trail, Lochside Regional Trail and the E&amp;N Rail Trail. The Galloping Goose Regional Trail in the Vic West neighbourhood has a bike barometer that automatically counts daily cyclist activity along the popular multi-use and cycling commuter trail. \nIn 2017 Victoria started building a planned 32 km all ages and abilities (AAA) bike network within the core of the city with a timeline to complete most of the network by the end of 2022. The AAA bike network in Victoria is meant to provide safe cycling facilities within 500m of where 95% of residents live. Cook Street was initially planned as part of the north–south route but faced neighbourhood resident and business opposition so the city opted to move the bike route to parallel Vancouver street. In contrast, downtown merchants where protected bike lanes have been installed are overwhelmingly positive after the construction of the protected bike lanes on Pandora avenue and Fort street.\nIn addition to bike lane infrastructure, Victoria has supported and implemented measures to make biking easier in the city. All Victoria Regional Transit buses have front racks that can accommodate two bicycles. Bicycle lockers are available at some park and ride bus stop locations and can be reserved through Capital Bike (formerly the Greater Victoria Cycling Coalition). Victoria has updated the off-street parking bylaw to require more bicycle parking for new developments and is proposing that at minimum, half of all new long-term bicycle parking must be in-ground racks for greater accessibility. In June 2022 Victoria piloted for the summer the opening of a secure downtown bicycle valet parking. The bicycle valet parking pilot operated until early November 2022 and in that time over 11,000 bicycles were parked in the secure area and over 750 bikes were registered with Project 529 by bike valet staff. \nManitoba.\nWinnipeg.\nWinnipeg maintains a total of 149 km of bike lanes, including 13 km of bike-only road routes, with plans for 375 km of active transportation routes, which includes multi-use pathways, neighbourhood pathways bike lanes, sharrows and bike boulevards.\nNew Brunswick.\nMoncton.\nThe city of Moncton has developed an active transportation plan to install some physically separated bike lanes by 2027. Separated bike lanes were recommended by city staff to council for Mountain Road between Wheeler Boulevard and Killam Drive by 2027, with a further extension on Mountain Road between West Lane and St. George Street to be completed sometime between 2028 and 2032. Shorter term separated bike lanes are planned along St. George Street, portions of Queen Street, Shediac Road, Elmwood Drive, Mapleton Road and Morton Avenue.There is also a longer term plan to add separated bike lanes on Salisbury road. \nSaint John.\nThe city of Saint John has plans to add buffered bike lanes on University avenue, and protected bike lanes on a northern section of Main street. A plan to develop detailed design work for Main street was approved by city council in May 2022 and will include a road diet that will allow the road to be narrowed and protected bike lanes added. Funding from the province will likely be required to build the protected bike lane on Main street. \nNewfoundland and Labrador.\nSt. John's.\nAs of 2016, St. John's had of active transportation facilities including 175 kilometres of multi-use trails (of the Grand Concourse) and 33 kilometres of on-street bike lanes.\nNova Scotia.\nNova Scotia is connecting bike routes throughout the province with the Blue Route.\nHalifax.\nAs of 2013, Halifax had of active transportation facilities including 131 kilometres of multi-use trails (called greenways) and 96 kilometres of bike lanes. Halifax has recently added protected bike lanes and is actively working to expand the bike lane network.\nOntario.\nA number of bicycle and mixed-use trails can be found throughout Ontario, with some crossing multiple municipalities. Many of these trails are provincially maintained, including Waterfront Trail. The province of Ontario used to provide municipalities with funding for bike infrastructure through the Ontario Municipal Commuter Cycling program that ended in 2018.\nBrantford.\nBrantford is the meeting point of several rail trails which connect through to other parts of the Ontario trails system. These include the SC Johnson Trail, the Hamilton to Brantford Rail Trail, and the LE&amp;N and TH&amp;B trails.\nHamilton.\nHamilton has a system of dedicated cycling infrastructure. It also has its own local bicycle sharing system, Hamilton Bike Share, which began operations in 2015. The city government invested $3.6 million into cycling infrastructure in 2021 to expand the network of cycling routes by an additional , following a $6 million investment in 2020, which was largely grant-supported. The city also diversified its range of infrastructure types by implementing bicycle boulevards.\nKitchener.\nKitchener released a Cycling and Trails Master Plan in 2020. The plan focused heavily on equity issues in cycling and on differentiating cycling infrastructure based on different physical abilities. It distinguished and gave primacy to an \"All Ages and Abilities Network\" category of cycling infrastructure consisting of physically protected cycling lanes, neighbourhood bikeways (designated cycling routes along lower-traffic residential streets), and multi-use trails, with unprotected painted bike lanes, paved shoulders, and unpaved trails given a secondary status as supporting rather than primary facilities. It also identified trails as important for both recreational and commuting opportunities, especially the two rail trails running through the city's urban core: the Iron Horse Trail and the Spurline Trail. Areas noted for improvement included safety, transit connectivity with the cycling network, year-round maintenance of cycling infrastructure, and availability of bicycle parking.\nConstruction began in 2021 on a key component of the 2020 Master Plan: the Downtown Cycling Grid, a planned system of protected cycling routes along existing downtown streets made possible due to the removal of street space previously dedicated to automobile traffic. A secondary component of the plan was designation of residential streets, mostly in outer parts of downtown, as neighbourhood bikeways.\nOttawa.\nMany of Ottawa's urban streets have a combination of cycling facilities, including bike lanes, cycle tracks and paved shoulders. The city also has a series of cycling and pedestrian bridges, four of which have opened since 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the city has 900 km of cycling facilities, including 435 km of multi use pathways, 8 km of cycle tracks, 200 km of on-street bicycle lanes and 257 km of paved shoulders. 204 km of facilities were added between 2011 and 2014.\nOttawa has a portion of the more than 250 km long Capital Pathway Network that it shares with the City of Gatineau. This mixed-use path extends to most suburban neighborhoods and into rural areas beyond, so that many long-distance commuters use at least part of it. It is a recreational pathway that is shared with walkers and runners, and not only apart from traffic, but mostly through parks, green spaces and along waterways. Ottawa closes over of Colonel By Drive, Kichi Zibi Mikan, and the Rockcliffe Parkway to traffic every Sunday morning May to September, effectively turning the streets into wide recreational lanes. Gatineau Park has a 90 kilometres of trails for mountain biking and for extreme thrill riders near Camp Fortune.\nThere is a commercial public bike-rental system. Ottawa's city transit have bike racks on all buses that are part of the transitway network and on express routes, but quite infrequently on local routes which use 40' buses. Bicycles are also easily taken aboard the O-Train, the city's light rail transit service.\nThe City of Ottawa was ranked as a \"Gold\" Bicycle Friendly Community in 2013 by Share the Road Cycling Coalition, the first city in Ontario to receive this provincial designation.\nThe 2013 Ottawa Cycling Plan intends to increase citywide cycling mode share during the morning peak period from 2.5 percent in 2011 to 5 percent in 2031 (8 percent and 12 percent respectively in the inner area).\nOn October 13, 2022, then candidate for mayor Mark Sutcliffe wrote that bike lanes would not help residents with \"groceries, taking your kids to school, getting to the community centre for hockey practice\".\nGreater Sudbury.\nThe city of Greater Sudbury developed a new Cycling and Pedestrian Master Plan in 2016. The plan called for an expansion of cycling infrastructure in the city's downtown core, as well as adjacent inner suburbs. It also included plans for the first implementation of dedicated cycle tracks in the city. Greater Sudbury received a Bicycle Friendly Community Award at the bronze level from the Share the Road Cycling Coalition in 2018. Sudbury and a number of outlying former towns sit on the Great Lakes Waterfront Trail.\nToronto.\nAs of December 2017, the City of Toronto has approximately 590 kilometres of on-street bike lanes, about 37 kilometres of which are protected from motor-vehicular traffic. Several types of bicycle lanes exist in Toronto. Types of bike lanes adopted in the city includes the cycle tracks, a type of lanes that uses a physical obstruction to protect cyclists from vehicular traffic. Bike lanes which do not use a physical barrier, use white lines and diamonds to distinguish the bike lanes from the rest of the roadway. Winter maintenance, including snow removal, for bike lanes is done by Toronto Works and Emergency Services. \nToronto also utilizes shared lane marking on roadways without bike lanes. The markings alert all road users of the presence of bicycle traffic on the street, although they are not considered dedicated cycling facilities. Shared lane markings are typically used to connect disjointed parts of the Toronto cycling network. In addition to on-street bike lanes, the city maintains a number bike trails located throughout the city's parks, and the Toronto ravine system.\nIn addition to cycling facilities such as bike lanes, the City of Toronto also operates bicycle parking facilities. These facilities include bicycle lockers, indoor bicycle parking stations, bicycle parking rack, and bicycle bollards. The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) also operates bicycle parking facilities at Toronto subway facilities, as well as bike carriers on the TTC buses. On 3 May 2011, a bicycle-sharing system was launched in the city. Bike Share Toronto is presently operated by the Toronto Parking Authority.\nThe cost of installing cycling infrastructure varies depending on the area in the city. To paint bicycle lanes on an existing road, the cost will typically be C$40,000–50,000 per km. The implementation of a cycle lane cost approximately $180,000 per km when installed with planters as the separator, although costs escalate up to C$1,000,000 per km for the construction of a curb separated cycle track.\nIn 2010, City of Toronto reported from a downtown study that 46 percent wore helmets, over 19,000 cyclists enter the downtown core daily, and the 24 percent of roads with bike lanes carried 45 percent of the bike traffic. In June 2016, the Toronto City Council approved a 10-year Cycling Network Plan which plans to add 280 km of bike lanes or cycle tracks on busy roadways, 55 km of bike trails adjacent to busy roadways, and 190 km of cycling routes along quiet roadways.\nWaterloo.\nWaterloo was recognized as a Gold Bicycle Friendly Community by the Share the Road Cycling Coalition in 2018. , the city has over of cycling infrastructure, which includes multi-use trails.\nIn 2020, the city embarked on a multifaceted safety programme for both pedestrians and cyclists, which included the implementation of several mid-block pedestrian crossings, speed limit reduction on certain streets to , and some roads being temporarily closed to through traffic, as well as the temporary implementation of slow streets in some areas. Physically protected cycling lanes were implemented along several streets and regional roads in Waterloo around this time as part of a pilot project, which was made permanent in 2021. These roadways had a relatively low number of cyclists, but were considered to have a high potential for growth in cycling traffic by local governments. During the pilot project, cycling traffic increased by , with a increase in traffic during the morning and afternoon peak travel hours.\nPrince Edward Island.\nThe Confederation Trail, a scenic and popular mixed-use rail trail, connects most of the main municipalities and other destinations across the island, as it runs along what used to be the Prince Edward Island Railway. The trail's use is popular as a tourist attraction and its use up to present has primarily been recreational. This may change as the province works towards its Active Transportation Network plan, which aims to make cycling regularly used for everyday practical transportation by creating fully-connected networks of safe cycling paths between destinations; the plan is due to be released in 2022.\nThe two cities, Summerside and Charlottetown, have started taking first steps to connect the regions in and around each city, but progress remains quite limited in terms of separated multi-use/cycling paths. Charlottetown in particular, features a number of multi-use paths, painted bike lanes, and bike tool locations, with significant plans for further expansion of trails and connectivity between different currently existing separated active transit transportation. \nQuébec.\nA number of bicycle and mixed-use trails can be found throughout Québec, with some crossing multiple municipalities. Many of these trails are provincially maintained, including the Route Verte trail network spread throughout the province.\nMontréal.\nMontreal is one of the few North American cities to have been listed as a bicycle friendly city on the Copenhagenize index and Global Bicycle Cities index. Montreal has a long history of activism for bicycle infrastructure thanks to the work of \"\" and was one of the earliest Canadian cities to install bicycle lanes. As of 2022, the metropolitan area of Montreal had 3,450km of bike lanes and shared routes Montreal plans to add 200 kilometres of protected and separated bike paths to the existing protected bike lane network by 2027. The Vision Vélo plan includes more than 40 projects that add to the existing Réseau Express Vélo (REV) bike highways and add safe bike routes into more outlying neighbourhoods. Montreal has 711km of bike routes that are maintained in all four seasons, including winter maintenance with snow plows.\nMontreal implemented North America's first large scale bicycle-sharing system known as BIXI in 2009. Users purchase daily or subscription usages for bikes, located in various depots throughout the city.\nThe Coupe du Monde Cycliste Féminine de Montréal female professional racing event has been held in Montreal since 1998. The Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal has also been held since 2010.\nQuébec City.\nQuébec City is expanding biking infrastructure within the city, as well as maintaining and extending scenic bike trails outside of the main city centre. The municipal public transit provider, RTC, maintains a network of e-bikes in and around Old Quebec, called àVélo, which allows quick rentals of e-bikes via a smartphone application.\nSaskatchewan.\nRegina.\nThe city of Regina maintains eight bikes routes, which consist of both shared and bike-only lanes.\nSaskatoon.\nThe city of Saskatoon has plans to build an All Ages and Abilities (AAA) bike network with added multi-use paths, protected bike lanes and neighbourhood bikeways, or bicycle boulevards, connecting across the city.

The team played their home games in Evans Diamond. They entered the 2011 season after making the postseason two of the last three years and with a 31–20 record, the Golden Bears won an at-large berth (therefore making the postseason three of the past four years) for the 2011 NCAA Division I baseball tournament, and were seeded #3 in the Houston. The Golden Bears lost the first game of the double-elimination format to the Baylor Bears, 6–4. California then went on to win their next four games in a row eliminating Alcorn State, #1 seed Rice, and Baylor. With their victory on June 6, the Bears advanced to a Super Regional for the first time since the 64 team format was introduced. California hosted its Super Regional games on June 11 and 12 sweeping Dallas Baptist to advance to the College World Series for the first time since 1992. Although the Bears hosted, the series was not at Evans Diamond in Berkeley, but at Stephen Schott Stadium in Santa Clara because Cal's stadium was not suitable for large television crews and did not have lights.\nPrevious season.\nCalifornia finished the 2010 regular season as the #6 team in the Pacific-10 Conference, and was eliminated in two games in the Norman Regional of the 2010 NCAA Division I baseball tournament.\nElimination.\nBecause of the severe budget crisis that was/is facing the entire state of California and the University of California system specifically, on September 28, 2010, University of California, Berkeley Chancellor Robert Birgeneau announced that five intercollegiate sports programs would be eliminated at Cal and the baseball program was one of the five. The decision to cut the sports (other sports were the Men's Gymnastics, Women's Gymnastics, and Women's Lacrosse team along with the demotion of the then 25-time national champion Rugby program) sparked outrage amongst the Berkeley community and alumni and fundraising efforts almost immediately began to save the programs. Due to successful fundraising efforts thanks in part to the baseball program's supporters, three of the five were reinstated on February 11, 2011, however, baseball and men's gymnastics were still slated to end at the end of the 2010–11 academic year. After raising nearly 10 million dollars by the month of April, the chancellor announced the immediate reinstatement of the California Golden Bears baseball team on April 8. The Men's Gymnastics program was reinstated on May 2.\nSchedule.\nThe season for California began on Sunday, February 20 with a home game against Utah, opening day was delayed twice due to rain in the San Francisco Bay Area. Their longest homestand was from March 16–17 (7 home games—originally 8), and their longest road trip was from May 3 through 24 (9 road games). Their final game of the regular season was on Saturday, May 29 at home against arch-rival Stanford. In 2011, the California Golden Bears baseball team won an at-large berth to the 2011 NCAA Division I baseball tournament and advanced to the Super Regionals. California then swept Dallas Baptist in Santa Clara to clinch a berth to the College World Series for the first time since 1992. The Golden Bears would go 1-2 in Omaha, defeating Texas A&amp;M and losing twice to #1 national seed Virginia.\nGolden Bears in the 2011 MLB Draft.\nThe following members of the California baseball program were drafted in the 2011 Major League Baseball Draft."

        "title": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1948",
        "text": "In the 1948 season, Somerset County Cricket Club competed in the County Championship, finishing twelfth out of seventeen teams. They were officially captained by three amateurs through the season; initially by Mandy Mitchell-Innes; then by Jake Seamer; and finally by George Woodhouse. The strains on consistent leadership were reflected in Somerset's variable form: after failing to win their first eight matches. Somerset did not win, lose or draw twice in consecutive matches in their following eight matches. In all, they won five times that season, and depended heavily upon the batting of Harold Gimblett, who scored 1,741 runs, and was Somerset's only player to score a century.\nOther than Gimblett, only two Somerset batsmen scored over 1,000 runs in the County Championship, Bertie Buse and Miles Coope, but both players did so at a significantly lower average. The team's bowling was led Horace Hazell, who claimed 92 wickets in the Championship. Maurice Tremlett, who had been highly praised for his performance on debut in 1947 continued to show promise, scoring over 1,000 first-class runs in all first-class matches and claiming 86 wickets, positioning himself as the county's leading all-rounder.\nBackground.\nCounty cricket had sojourned during the Second World War, and only returned in 1946. Most of the players had seen war service in some form or another, and very few of them had played much cricket of any form, which resulted in a temporary drop in quality. As most of the players were the same as those from before the war, it also meant that the average age of a county cricketer was higher than usual. The social change that was occurring all around Great Britain also had an effect on county cricket, and at Somerset it resulted in their professional players gathering together to ask for better playing conditions and greater pay. Despite these changes, and the relative weakness of amateur players in comparison to the professionals, Somerset, as like many other counties, insisted on naming amateurs as captains. In 1946, Bunty Longrigg, who had captained Somerset before the war had resumed his duties, but he retired at the end of the season as was replaced by Jack Meyer for 1947. Meyer had reluctantly agreed to captain the side in the absence of any other candidates, but stepped down at the end of his single season, citing his fading eyesight and lumbago.\nAs a result of Meyer's resignation, the Somerset committee was once more required to recruit a captain for the following season. Still limiting themselves by requiring an amateur to take on the role—Somerset would not appoint a professional captain until 1956— the committee found that there was no player \"of a suitable pedigree who could make himself available for the whole summer.\" So, with no single candidate suitable, the Somerset committee announced that the club would be captained by three players; first by Mandy Mitchell-Innes and then by Jake Seamer during their respective periods of leave from the Sudan Political Service. Once both of these had returned to their duties, George Woodhouse would take over. In his history of Somerset County Cricket Club, Peter Roebuck describes the situation as a \"remarkable state of affairs\", while David Foot suggests that the true number of captains was closer to seven.\nSquad.\nThe following players made at least one appearance for Somerset in first-class matches. Age given is at the start of Somerset's first match of the season (5 May 1948).\nCounty Championship.\nSeason standings.\n\"Note: Pld = Played, W = Wins, L = Losses, LWF = Lost but won on 1st innings, DW1 = Won on 1st innings in drawn match played under 1-day rules, DL1 = Lost on 1st innings in drawn match played under 1-day rules, DWF = Won on 1st innings in drawn match, DLF = Lost on 1st innings in drawn match, ND = No Decision on 1st innings, Pts = Points, (C) = Champions.\""

He served as the defensive coordinator at prominent college football programs like Ohio State (1988–1995), Oklahoma (1996–1997), USC (1998–2000), Miami (2008), and Oklahoma State (2009–2012).\nEarly years.\nBorn in Hereford, Texas, Young attended U.S. Grant High School in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He attended Oklahoma State University and graduated in 1968. He later earned a master's degree from Central Oklahoma.\nAfter his senior year of high school Young was named to the Oklahoma all-state team as an alternate. Young was a defensive lineman at Oklahoma State. He started for three years and was an academic all-conference player. He was also an honorable mention all-conference player.\nCoaching career.\nAfter graduating, Young spent six seasons as a high school coach at Carl Albert and Putnam City West before returning to Oklahoma State as a graduate assistant.\nYoung was a finalist for the Broyles Award, given to the nation's top assistant coach, while at Kansas in 2007. He then orchestrated a defensive turnaround unprecedented at Oklahoma State. For once the defense was actually the bright spot on the team as it finished in the Top 35 in the nation in 2009.\nWhen hired by Oklahoma State, Young stated that he was torn between having to choose between Miami and OSU. He also went on to say \"It means a lot to me to come back to OSU because I am a graduate, I played there and now we are back as part of the Cowboy family. My wife and I are very excited to get back to Stillwater and Oklahoma State.\""

        "text": "Michael Alan Carey (born July 4, 1958) is the former head coach of the West Virginia University women's basketball team. He had previously served as head basketball coach for the Salem International University men's basketball team.\nCarey played basketball for Salem International University, earning a letter in each of his four years at the school. In his freshman year, he was named the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference freshman of the year, an honor his son would win in 2006.\nHigh school.\nBorn and raised in Clarksburg, West Virginia, Carey was active in three sports while attending Liberty High School.\nCollege career.\nCarey played basketball each of his four years at Salem. He was named the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WVIAC) freshman of the year in 1977. He went on to be the conference scoring leader in 1978, and earned MVP honors for Salem in 1979. In that year, he was also named to the WVIAC all-conference team. In his four years at Salem, he scored over 2,000 points. Carey was named to the Salem Athletic Hall of Fame in 1993.\nCoaching career.\nFlemington and Clarksburg Liberty.\nAfter graduating from Salem in 1980 with a degree in physical education, Carey was offered a position to be an assistant coach of the boys' team at the high school Flemington, West Virginia. Carey was interested, but the job offer came with a catch. He also had to be the head coach of the girls' team. He accepted the offer. He went on to coach girls' basketball at the high school level for seven years, in Flemington and at Liberty High School in Clarksburg, West Virginia. In his final year as high school coach, he earned coach of the year honors from Harrison County and coached the team to the regional finals.\nSalem.\nCarey returned to his alma mater and became the assistant coach for the Salem men's basketball program in 1987. After one year as an assistant he became the head coach in 1988. The program did not have a history of success, posting an 8–19 record in the year before he took over, but Carey coached the team to a winning record in his first year as head coach. In thirteen seasons, his teams had only one losing record. In nine of the thirteen years, the team won more than 20 games. Twice, the teams made it to the Division II Elite eight and in 1997, the team made it to the Division II Final Four.\nCarey celebrated his milestone 250th victory on January 29, 2000, in an 86–76 victory over Shepherd College. At the time, he had coached teams to the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference championship five times. By the time he completed his coaching career at Salem, teams he coached made seven post-season appearances, with five in the NCAA division II tournaments, and two in the NAIA tournaments.\nWest Virginia.\nCarey took over a team that had only five wins in its previous season. In his first season, the team improved to 14–14, and has had only one losing season since (15–16 in 2005–06). On January 29, 2008, West Virginia would upset Rutgers University, then ranked #4 in the country, representing the highest ranked team they had beaten in school history.\nIn 2007–08, the team earned its first top 20 ranking in school history, reaching as high as 11th place in both major polls. They ended the year at 25–8, and advanced to the second round of the NCAA tournament.\nIn 2009–10, West Virginia won a school-record 29 games. The team was ranked as high as #7 in the AP Poll during the year, and reached semi-finals of the Big East women's basketball tournament, only to fall to Connecticut. Despite the success of the year, Carey still has not achieved one of his goals—to beat Connecticut. He said, \"This is my 10th year and we've beat every team in the conference except Connecticut\". The team was undefeated at home for only the second time in program history. The Big East voted him co-coach of the year, along with Geno Auriemma.\nCarey's 200th win at West Virginia occurred on February 19, 2011, in a game against Pittsburgh. West Virginia had failed to win in their previous three attempts to reach the 200 win milestone, but the team prevailed against Pittsburgh 90–79.\nAfter a 24–10 season in 2011, Carey's Mountaineers lost five seniors to graduation. The team had four incoming freshman for the upcoming, a class ranked #21, by ESPNU HoopGurlz.\nOn December 28, Carey's team helped him reach a milestone–his 500th career victory. The game didn't start out like it would finish—opponent Bucknell University started out with a 6–2 lead before the Mountaineers ran off 12 straight points to take a large lead. West Virginia ended up winning easily, 72–30, leading to Carey's 212th win at West Virginia, and his 500th career victory, after 228 wins at Salem.\nCarey's team achieved their biggest win in basketball history on February 12, 2011, when they beat Notre Dame at Notre Dame 65–53. Notre Dame had only a single loss prior to the win, and was ranked # 2 in the nation, by both the AP and ESPN Coaches poll.\nOn March 16, 2022, Carey announced his retirement as the head coach of the WVU women's basketball team citing that he wanted to spend more time with family. He retired as the winningest women's basketball coach in the university's history and took the team to the NCAA tournament ten times.\nIn 2022, Carey was replaced by Dawn Plitzuweit who previously served as the head coach of the women's basketball team at the University of South Dakota. After a first-round loss in the 2023 NCAA tournament in, she announced her hiring by the University of Minnesota. In response to this, Carey announced his interest in returning as the head coach of the women's team at WVU.\nPersonal.\nMike Carey is married to Cheryl (Minnix) Carey. Together, they have four children—Chris, Chelsy, Craig and Chelby. Chris played basketball for Fairmont State, where he won the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference freshman of the year, an award also won by his father. Craig played on the practice team for the women's team, a team made up of men and women who serve as a practice squad for the varsity team. He is now on the West Virginia University men's basketball team. Chelsy Carey is on the cheer leading squad for the women's team. Chelby Carey played basketball for the Morgantown High School girls' basketball team."

        "text": "The Longwood Lancers men's basketball team is the Division I basketball team that represents Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. Since 2012, the team has competed in the Big South Conference of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. Their current head coach is Griff Aldrich, a one-time lawyer and chief financial officer of a private equity firm who formerly served as the recruiting director for UMBC. The Lancers made their first appearance in the NCAA tournament in 2022, followed by another appearance in 2024.\nHistory.\nLongwood was an all-female school for the majority of its history; however, a limited number of male day students attended the school following World War II, and those students fielded a basketball team under the name Longwood Pioneers. The current NCAA men's basketball program began in 1976 under head coach Allan McNamee, when the school became fully co-educational that same year. The Lancers finished 1–6 against four year institutions in the inaugural season, and 2–9 overall. The Lancers were NCAA Division III members for their first four years. In 1980, they became Division II members, until 2004, when they began a transition to Division I membership. They became full Division I members in 2007.\nIn 2022, the Lancers won the Big South tournament and earned their first trip to the NCAA tournament as a Division I program. In the 2021-2022 season, Longwood had the best record in the Big South (15-1) and won the regular-season conference championship (North Division). In the Big South tournament championship, the team held the lead over Winthrop wire-to-wire through the entire game. \nIn 2024, the Lancers won the Big South men's basketball tournament for the second time in three years and earned a berth in the NCAA Division I Tournament. In the Big South Tournament, the team entered as a 5-seed and beat No. 4 seed Gardner-Webb, No. 1 seed High Point, and No. 2 seed UNC-Asheville.\nThe Lancers have been members of three conferences in their history: the Division II Mason–Dixon Conference from 1983 to 1988 (not to be confused with another defunct conference with the same name, which disbanded in 1974) and the-then Carolinas–Virginia Athletic Conference from 1995 to 2003. Longwood spent nine seasons as an independent during and after reclassification to Division I, until they joined the Big South Conference in 2012.\nLongwood previously reached the NCAA tournament three times during its Division II history and once at the Division III level. In 1988, Longwood won a share of the Mason-Dixon Conference regular season title, and in 2001, won the CVAC tournament championship as a 3 seed.\nThe Lancers currently play in Willett Hall on Jerome Kersey Court, named after former Longwood basketball player and NBA star Jerome Kersey. In 2019, Longwood announced a $15 million donation to begin construction of a new, 72,000 square foot convocation and events center that will replace Willett Hall as the venue for Lancer basketball. The Joan Perry Brock Center, named after its benefactor, will seat up to 3,000, and is scheduled to open in 2023.\nThe Lancers have had nine different head coaches of their men's basketball team, as detailed below. The current head coach, former UMBC director of recruiting Griff Aldrich, joined the program in 2018.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Lancers have appeared in two NCAA tournaments. Their combined record is 0–2.\nCBI.\nThe Lancers have appeared in the Division I College Basketball Invitational (CBI) tournament two times. Their record is 1–2.\nNCAA Division II tournament results.\nThe Lancers have appeared in the NCAA Division II tournament three times. Their combined record is 2–4.\nNCAA Division III tournament results.\nThe Lancers appeared in the NCAA Division III tournament once. Their record is 3–2.\nNotable players.\nJerome Kersey #54.\nJerome Kersey is widely known as the best player in Longwood history. Playing from 1980 to 1984 Kersey set school records for points, rebounds, steals and blocked shots while making 57% of his baskets. As a senior, his rebounding average of 14.2 led all Division II players.\nIn 1984, Kersey was selected 46th overall in the NBA draft by the Portland Trail Blazers. He became a starter and was part of the nucleus of a strong Portland team, along with Clyde Drexler, Terry Porter, Buck Williams, and Kevin Duckworth that made it to the NBA Finals two out of the next three years (in 1990 and 1992). Kersey also finished second to Michael Jordan in the 1987 Slam Dunk Contest. In 1999, Kersey won an NBA Championship with the San Antonio Spurs. He would eventually retire in 2001 as a member of the Milwaukee Bucks.\nIn May 2006, Kersey graduated from Longwood, having only needed two more college courses to graduate for some years.\nKevin Jefferson #33.\nKevin Jefferson played for the Lancers from 1986–1990. Jefferson ended his career with 1,806 career points, as record that would hold for 22 years.\nColin Ducharme #52.\nThe 6'9\" Ducharme would transfer to Longwood from the University of Virginia for his final year of eligibility in 2000. Ducharme averaged 19.6 points and 15.8 rebounds per game in his one year in Farmville. He led Longwood to a CVAC championship and an NCAA tournament appearance while being named the Division II National Player of the Year by multiple outlets. Ducharme remains only one of two retired numbers in Longwood history, with the other being Jerome Kersey.\nAntwan Carter #4.\nAntwan Carter became the most efficient players in Longwood history and its best player so far in the Division I era. Playing from 2008–2012, Carter would break Kevin Jefferson's all-time scoring record and finished his career scoring 1,886 points. Carter also finished second in Longwood history in rebounds with 1,008."

In the case of both teams scoring the same number of goals over the two legs, the winner was determined by whichever team scored more goals in their away leg.

This edition has scheduled five separate men's tournaments, four women's tournaments, and the Western &amp; Southern Open that will host both a men's and women's event. The series includes two ATP World Tour Masters 1000 and two WTA Premier 5 events to headline the series.\nPoint distribution for series events.\nTo be included in the standings and subsequently the bonus prize money, a player has to have countable results from two different tournaments. Players finishing in the top three in the series can earn up to $1 million in extra prize money at the US Open. Roger Federer received the largest US Open pay day of $2.4 million in 2007 after capturing the title in both the US Open Series and the US Open championship.\nUS Open Series standings.\nThe standings below include all players who have received points from at least two tournaments in the US Open Series.\nWeek 1.\nATP – Atlanta Tennis Championships.\nDefending champion, Mardy Fish, last year's finalist, John Isner, and 2010 semifinalist, Kevin Anderson, headlined the event. Isner was nearly the first big upset of the tournament, needing nearly three hours to defeat fellow American James Blake in the second round. Nineteen-year-old Ryan Harrison reached his first ATP Tour semifinal, but ultimately fell to Fish who defeated Isner in a rematch of last year's final.\nWeek 2.\nATP – Farmers Classic.\nAtlanta champion, Mardy Fish, and 2009 US Open champion, Juan Martín del Potro, headlined the event. Despite being unseeded, Lu Yen-hsun and Ryan Harrison brought their good form from Atlanta to achieve consecutive quarterfinal appearances in the Series. Fish also continued on with his good form, extending his winning streak to seven matches. He was joined by three unseeded players in the semifinals, including Ernests Gulbis, who went on to upset Fish in the final.\nWTA – Bank of the West Classic.\nDefending champion, Victoria Azarenka, last year's finalist, Maria Sharapova, and 13-time Grand Slam champion, Serena Williams, headlined the event. Playing her first tournament on American soil since 2009, Williams showed excellent form, serving bagels in her opening round match, and followed that win by upsetting Sharapova in the quarterfinals. With Azarenka's exit in the second round, Marion Bartoli took advantage of the open draw and advanced to the final. In only her third tournament of the year, Williams defeated Bartoli to take the title.\nWeek 3.\nATP – Legg Mason Tennis Classic.\nGaël Monfils and defending champion, David Nalbandian, headlined the event. Atlanta champion, Mardy Fish, who also reached the final of the Farmers Classic, was forced to withdraw from the tournament, citing a bruised right heel. Serbian duo, Viktor Troicki and Janko Tipsarević, who were expected to reach the quarterfinals because of their seedings, joined the lower-ranked American duo, John Isner and Donald Young, in the final eight. Radek Štěpánek took advantage of Fish's withdrawal from the tournament and advanced to the final, where he took out top seed Monfils for his fifth title of his career.\nWTA – Mercury Insurance Open.\nVera Zvonareva, Andrea Petkovic, and former world number one, Ana Ivanovic, headlined the event. Sloane Stephens' upset over Julia Görges resulted in the American wildcard being the only unseeded player in the final eight, while Ivanovic's upset over Peng Shuai spoiled a semifinal lineup of the top four seeds. Despite sustaining a shoulder injury earlier in the tournament, Agnieszka Radwańska was able to reach the final for the second consecutive year and defeat top-seed, Zvonareva, for the title.\nWeek 4.\nATP – Rogers Cup.\nNovak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, and two-time defending champion, Andy Murray, headlined the event. Murray and Nadal suffered the first upsets of the tournament, with Murray losing badly to South Africa's Kevin Anderson and Nadal falling to Ivan Dodig after the Croat pulled off a comeback win. Federer followed suit, losing in the third round to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga for the second consecutive time in the third round, while Djokovic improved on his win and loss record of the year to 52-1. Atlanta champion and Washington runner-up, Mardy Fish, continued on with his good form on the Series advancing to his third consecutive final. In the final, Djokovic won his 53rd match of the year, defeating Fish 6-4 in the third set.\nWTA – Rogers Cup.\nThe top 20, including Caroline Wozniacki, Kim Clijsters, and Maria Sharapova, along with Stanford champion, Serena Williams, headlined the event. Despite a long lay-off due to a foot injury, Clijsters was once again forced to retire from her opening round match citing an abdominal injury. The tournament suffered the loss of another headliner early on as defending champion, Wozniacki, was knocked out in the second round. The third round brought about more upsets, as the number three seed, Vera Zvonareva, and Sharapova lost to Agnieszka Radwańska and Galina Voskoboeva, respectively. Despite losing only six games en route to the semifinals, fourth seed, Victoria Azarenka, lost in straight sets to Stanford champion, Williams, who extended her win streak to ten matches. Williams won her second tournament of the Series, defeating Samantha Stosur in the final.\nWeek 5.\nATP – Western &amp; Southern Open.\nMontreal champion, Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, defending champion, Roger Federer, and Atlanta champion, Mardy Fish, headlined the event. The top eight seeds cruised to the quarterfinals with exception to fifth-seeded, David Ferrer, who lost his third round match to Gilles Simon. The quarterfinals brought a pair of upsets as former world number ones, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, bowed out to Fish and Tomáš Berdych, respectively. Neither player could follow up the win, and instead, Andy Murray handed Djokovic his second loss of the year after the world number one was forced to retire from the championship match.\nWTA - Western &amp; Southern Open.\nCaroline Wozniacki, Vera Zvonareva, Maria Sharapova, and Stanford and Toronto champion, Serena Williams, headlined the event. Wozniacki lost her opening match for the second tournament in a row, losing to American wildcard, Christina McHale, while Williams was forced to withdraw from the tournament, citing a toe injury. Russians, Zvonareva and Sharapova, advanced to the semifinals without dropping a set, joining lower-seeded players, Andrea Petković and Jelena Janković in the final four. In a battle of former world number ones, Sharapova defeated Janković in a three-set thriller.\nWeek 6.\nATP - Winston-Salem Open.\nFormer world number one, Andy Roddick, and fellow American, John Isner, headlined the event. Where the top half of the draw held to seeds through to the semifinals, the bottom half of the draw saw qualifier, Julien Benneteau, advance to the final. Isner defeated Benneteau to secure a third-place finish in the Series.\nWTA - New Haven Open at Yale.\nThree-time defending champion, Caroline Wozniacki, and French Open finalists, Li Na and Francesca Schiavone, headlined the event. Agnieszka Radwańska had the chance to win the Series if she advanced to the final, but lost to Petra Cetkovská in the second round. Cetkovská's run of good form continued on to the final where she faced world number one, Wozniacki. Wozniacki defeated Cetkovská for a fourth consecutive title in New Haven."

The name is something of a misnomer, since there were other NHL franchises that ceased operations before 1942, including some that were founded before some of the Original Six. The term dates from the 1967 expansion which added six new franchises; hence the six expansion teams and the \"Original Six\".\nCanadian television coverage.\nIn the 1952–53 season, CBC began televising \"Hockey Night in Canada\" as a simulcast to the radio calls, joining the games in progress either 30 minutes or 60 minutes after the opening faceoff. Until 1961, the CBC was the only operating television network in Canada. Not only that, it was likely that not all Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens playoff games were televised in the early years, including to their local markets.\nAmerican television coverage.\nThere was no American network television coverage of the Stanley Cup playoffs until 1965–66 (which also marked the first telecasts of an NHL game in color), the second to last season of the Original Six era. The earliest known American television coverage of any kind occurred in 1956, when Games 3 and 5 of the Montreal-New York Rangers playoff series were televised in the New York area on WPIX 11 at 9 p.m. local time. Bud Palmer worked play-by-play for those games on WPIX while and Jack McCarthy hosted from the studio."

        "text": "The 1997 Scottish Challenge Cup final was an association football match between Falkirk and Queen of the South on 2 November 1997 at Fir Park in Motherwell. It was the eighth final of the Scottish Challenge Cup since it was first organised in 1990 to celebrate the centenary of the Scottish Football League.\nThe tournament was contested by clubs below the Scottish Premier Division; Falkirk from the First Division and Queen of the South from the Second Division. The match was Falkirk's first national cup final in only six months since contesting the final of the Scottish Cup the previous season in May. It was also the club's second appearance in the Scottish Challenge Cup Final since winning in 1993. The match was Queen of the South's first national cup final in its 78-year history. David Hagen scored the only goal, which was enough for Falkirk to win the match 1–0 and the tournament for the second time.\nRoute to the final.\nFalkirk.\nFalkirk were drawn against Dumbarton away from home in the first round and produced a 2–0 victory over The Sons. The second round saw Forfar Athletic travel to Brockville Park and be beaten 3–1. Another home game for Falkirk was drawn in the quarter-finals against Stranraer which saw The Bairns triumph 3–0 winners to progress to the semi-finals. The opposition provided was Hamilton Academical which saw Falkirk win with a 2–1 victory and send the club to a Scottish Challenge Cup final for the second time in its history.\nQueen of the South.\nQueen of the South faced a long trip to Inverness Caledonian Thistle in the first round which saw the team emerge 2–0 winners. The second round was a home game with the visitors in the form of Stirling Albion with The Doonhamers producing a second consecutive 2–0 victory. A trip to Airdrieonians was the reward for reaching the quarter-finals with Queen of the South edging the opposition out to win 3–2. Morton provided the opposition for the Dumfries club in the semi-finals with the team producing their third 2–0 victory of the tournament. Queen of the South reached the Scottish Challenge Cup final for the first time.\nPre-match.\nAnalysis.\nBefore the final, after four games played each, both Falkirk and Queen of the South had only conceded four goals between them. Queen of the South earned three clean sheets bettering Falkirk's two. At the other end Falkirk had scored ten goals to Queen of the South's nine.\nMatch summary.\nQueens performed creditably against the Falkirk side who at the time were playing in a higher division of the Scottish football set up, cheered on noisily by the QoS supporters witnessing their team in their first national cup final since the Scottish Qualifying Cup win of 1923/24. The decisive moment of the game was when Falkirk's David Hagen scored in the sixty fifth minute. Queens' had a late opportunity to equalise when Tommy Bryce teed up Derek Townsley in a good shooting position just outside the Falkirk penalty area. Townsley's shot however failed to trouble Paul Mathers in the Falkirk goal as the ball went over the cross bar. Hagen's goal was enough to separate the sides with Bryce taking the man of the match award."

Eight regional competitions were held to determine the participants in the final event. Each region was composed of six teams, resulting in 48 teams participating in the tournament at the conclusion of their regular season, and in some cases, after a conference tournament. The fiftieth tournament's champion was LSU, coached by Skip Bertman. The Most Outstanding Player was Pat Burrell of Miami (FL).\nRegionals.\nThe opening rounds of the tournament were played across eight regional sites across the country, each consisting of a six-team field.

        "text": "The 1999 Scottish Challenge Cup final, also known as the Bell's Challenge Cup final for sponsorship reasons, was a football match between Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Alloa Athletic on 21 November 1999 at Excelsior Stadium in Airdrie. It was the ninth final of the Scottish Challenge Cup since it was first organised in 1990 to celebrate the centenary of the Scottish Football League.\nBoth teams progressed through four elimination rounds to reach the final. The match was Alloa Athletic's first national cup final in its 121-year history whilst it was Inverness Caledonian Thistle's first since the club was founded five years beforehand in 1994. The tournament was contested by clubs below the Scottish Premier League; Inverness Caledonian Thistle from the First Division and Alloa Athletic from the Second Division.\nAlloa led the match 2–1 at half-time but only two minutes after the interval both teams scored to make it 3–2 by the 47th minute. Paul Sheerin scored a second penalty for Inverness in the 56th minute to make the score 3–3 which is how the scoreline remained after 90 minutes, which forced an additional 30 minutes of extra time to be played. Martin Cameron scored his second goal for Alloa in the 104th minute to take a 4–3 lead but was cancelled out when Sheerin completed a hat-trick of goals for Inverness to make it 4–4 and take the game to penalties. Alloa Athletic emerged victorious after winning the shoot-out 5–4.\nRoute to the final.\nThe competition is a knock-out tournament and in 1999 was contested by the 30 teams that played in the First, Second and Third Divisions of the Scottish Football League. 28 of the teams entered the first round and two received random byes into the second round to even the number of fixtures. Teams were paired at random and the winner of each match progressed to the next round and the loser was eliminated. The tournament returned for the first time since 1997 after it was suspended for one season due to the absence of a sponsor.\nInverness Caledonian Thistle.\nNewly promoted to the First Division as runners-up in the Second Division the previous season, Inverness entered the first round and faced fellow First Division club St. Mirren at Caledonian Stadium. Inverness won the match 1–0 with a late goal in the 88th minute from Mike Teasdale to progress to the second round. The second round draw paired the club with Second Division club Hamilton Academical at Douglas Park. Inverness comfortably won the tie 3–0 with two goals from Iain Stewart and one from Scott McLean to advance to the quarter-finals.\nInverness faced a home game against Clydebank in the quarter-finals. Goals in each half from Martin Glancy and Barry Robson resulted in a 2–0 win for Inverness over the First Division club. With four teams left in the competition, Inverness were drawn against Livingston, also from the First Division. The scoreline was 0–0 most of the game until Paul Sheerin scored a late winner for Inverness in the 88th minute to win the match 1–0 for the club. The result meant that Inverness kept four clean sheets before qualifying for the first national cup final in the club's history.\nAlloa Athletic.\nAlloa Athletic also entered the first round and were drawn against Third Division club Cowdenbeath away from home. Goals from Martin Cameron, David Beaton, Gregor McKechnie and an own goal from Scott Sneddon was enough for Alloa to comfortably win 4–0 at Central Park and advance to the next round. The second round also saw Alloa drawn away from home; facing First Division club Airdrieonians at Excelsior Stadium. With Airdrie the favourites to win the match, Alloa took a shock 2–0 lead with goals from Mark Nelson and Gregor McKechnie. Airdrie scored a consolation goal in the last minute from Forbes Johnston to make it 2–1, but Alloa held on to win and progressed to the quarter-finals.\nIn the quarter-finals, Alloa faced another away game, this time at fellow Second Division club Ross County. George Shaw scored to give Ross County a 1–0 lead before half-time and Alloa equalised late in the second half through Mark Donaghy in the 82nd minute which made the score 1–1 to force extra time. Willie Irvine scored the winner for Alloa in the 113th minute to send the club through to the semi-finals. With the last four clubs left in the tournament, Alloa was drawn against local rival Stirling Albion with both clubs aiming to reach the first national cup final in their history. Stirling took the lead in the first half but were reduced to 10-men after Chris Wood was sent off in the 71st minute. Alloa replied with a goal from Scott Bannerman and then a penalty in the 80th minute from Willie Irvine to win 2–1 and reach the final.\nPre-match.\nVenue.\nThe 1999 final marked the first time the event was hosted at Excelsior Stadium in Airdrie, the home of Airdrieonians. The venue opened only a year before the final in 1998 and was officially known as \"Shyberry Excelsior Stadium\", after its sponsor. Alloa had previously played at the stadium during the same tournament having eliminated Airdrieonians 2–1 away from home in the second round. Inverness travelled around to the venue whereas Alloa had to travel only around .\nAnalysis.\nIn order to reach the final, Alloa played all four matches in the preceding rounds away from home, keeping only one clean sheet and recording three successive 2–1 away wins. Inverness kept a clean sheet in all four matches, scoring seven goals without reply in the rounds before the final.&lt;ref name=\"Soccerbase_1999/00\"&gt;Scottish League Challenge Cup 1999/00, \"soccerbase.com\", Retrieved 9 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;\nAlloa were in good form before the match, losing only three of their previous 22 games in all competitions since the start of the season in late July.&lt;ref name=\"LondonHearts_Alloa_1999/00\"&gt;Results for Alloa Athletic for 1999–2000, \"londonhearts.com\". London Hearts Supporters' Club. Retrieved 28 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the final, Alloa were equal on points at the top of the Second Division table but ranked third on goal difference. Inverness were favourites to win the match being the higher ranked club as a competitor in the First Division, one tier above Alloa who were in the Second Division. Inverness were ranked seventh from ten in the First Division at the time of the final, 20 points behind runaway leaders St. Mirren. After five games unbeaten in the league, Inverness lost their last league game before the final 5–1 away to Morton.\nTerry Christie, the Alloa manager, had won the Scottish Challenge Cup once before with Second Division club Stenhousemuir after a surprise penalty shoot-out win against Dundee United in the 1995 final and hoped to replicate his success with Alloa. The two finalists had met in the Scottish Challenge Cup once before; Alloa won 2–1 away to Caledonian Thistle at Telford Street Park in the first round of the 1995–96 tournament, the same year Christie won with Stenhousemuir.&lt;ref name=\"statto_95/96\"&gt;Scottish Challenge Cup 1995–1996 : First Round, \"statto.com\". Retrieved 9 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;\nMatch.\nFirst half.\nInverness played in a 4–4–2 formation whilst Alloa played a 3–4–3 arrangement. After ten minutes, Alloa missed a goal scoring opportunity when Martin Cameron's shot went above the cross-bar after a pass from Gary Clark and three minutes later Mark Wilson's shot forced a save from Inverness goalkeeper Les Fridge. Alloa scored the first goal of the game in the 19th minute with a 12-yard shot from Gary Clark when Inverness failed to clear the ball from a corner kick. Shortly after, Alloa went close to doubling their lead when Fridge was forced to make another save. Alloa dominated the match for most of the first half-hour but Inverness equalised the score at 1–1 on 28 minutes when Alloa goalkeeper Mark Cairns deflected the ball into the path of striker Barry Wilson after making his first save of the game from a shot by Davide Xausa. Three minutes later, Alloa midfielder Mark Wilson ran clear down the right wing and shot the ball past goalkeeper Fridge to restore Alloa's lead to 2–1 before half-time.\nSecond half.\nOnly one minute into the second half, Alloa player Derek Clark committed a foul on Dennis Wyness in the penalty box and Inverness were awarded a penalty kick. Inverness midfielder Paul Sheerin took the penalty kick in the 46th minute and equalised the score to 2–2. One minute after the penalty, Alloa restored their lead when Cameron dispossessed the ball from defender Mike Teasdale and scored to take a 3–2 lead after 47 minutes. Referee Jim McCluskey awarded Inverness their second penalty kick of the game ten minutes later when Alloa defender David Beaton handled the ball in the box and Sheerin again equalised the scoreline at 3–3. Between the 65th and 67th minute, Alloa made the first substitutions of the game: Mark Wilson and Gary Clark were replaced by Gregor McKechnie and Max Christie respectively. Five minutes later, Inverness substituted defender Stuart Golabek with Kevin Byers. After the equalising goal, Inverness players Sheerin and Charlie Christie started to dominate the midfield area of the pitch and Christie and Xausa both had chances to win the match for Inverness. Alloa managed to keep the score at 3–3 for the rest of the match until the full-time whistle to force the game into extra time.\nExtra time and penalties.\nCameron had a chance to score for Alloa in the 92nd minute but his shot was blocked by goalkeeper Fridge. However, he then scored his second goal of the game in the 103rd minute after a pass from Max Christie. Ten minutes later, Sheerin then completed a hat-trick of goals for Inverness in the 112th minute, becoming only the second player to score three goals in the final match of the competition after Billy Dodds in 1990. With the score equal at 4–4 at the end of extra time, the game was decided by a penalty shoot-out.\nThe shoot-out was a best-of-five and Willie Irvine took the first penalty for Alloa and scored. Paul Sheerin took Inverness's first penalty and despite scoring three goals during the game, two of which were from penalty kicks, he missed. David Beaton then struck the bar and missed for Alloa and Mark McCulloch levelled the score for Inverness to 2–2. Both teams then scored their next three penalties to make it 4-all from five attempts so the shoot-out went to sudden death. Alloa goalkeeper Cairns took the penalty and scored; he then saved Teasdale's attempt to ensure Alloa won 5–4 in the shoot-out.\nPost-match.\nThe trophy was presented to Alloa captain Craig Valentine after the game by Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden.\nJim McCluskey, the referee of the game, retired a year after the final and when reflecting on his time as a referee, mentioned the game was one of the highlights of his career saying: \"It was an unbelievable game of football between two teams who were appearing in their first major cup final and they both just went for it. I was proud to have refereed it.\"\nThe two clubs were drawn against each other at the first possible opportunity in the first round of the 2000–01 tournament. Inverness won the match 3–2 despite Alloa scoring the fastest goal in the history of the tournament to take a 1–0 lead after 54 seconds.\nBoth clubs have made further appearances in the final of the tournament since the match; Alloa lost to Airdrieonians and Livingston in the 2001 and 2015 finals respectively, whilst Inverness beat Airdrie United in 2003 and lost to Dundee in 2009."

        "text": "The Ghana Rugby Association, operating as the Ghana Rugby Football Union, is the governing body for rugby union in Ghana. It is a member of Rugby Africa and a full member of World Rugby since 2017.\nHerbert Mensah Presidency - since 5 June 2014.\n Prior to his appointment as President of Ghana Rugby, Mensah was appointed to the executive of the Greater Accra Rugby Association (GARA) in May 2014. At the occasion, he stressed the importance to build infrastructure to motivate the youth and to grow the game of rugby in Ghana. On assuming office, his first priority was to order an assessment of the state of rugby in Ghana by his board members. He travelled to Dublin to meet with officials of World Rugby to seek guidance on the development of Rugby in Ghana. The meeting was followed up with a meeting, also in Dublin, with the Rugby Africa Development Manager.\nHe also met with various stakeholders including regional associations, clubs, players and the business community.\nOn Friday, 29 August 2014, Mensah convened a Ghana Rugby Stakeholder Forum in Accra, where the Ghana Rugby Blueprint was presented.\nHe also arranged training sessions for both coaches and referees to improve the quality of the sport in Ghana. The coaches' training conducted by Mr David Dobela of South Africa was described as a historical event for Ghana Rugby as it was the first time in 11 years that coaches were trained on both Level 1 and Level 2 for rugby union and Sevens coaching.\nBased on his consultations with both World Rugby and Rugby Africa, Mensah realised that a stumbling block in the way of Ghana Rugby to become a full member of World Rugby was the successful completion of a successfully run local league by at least ten clubs. He immediately mobilised his resources, and planned and completed the first professionally run Ghana Rugby Club Championship (GRCC).\nOne of Mensah's major challenges as president of Ghana Rugby remains funding the sport and he has initiated various activities including a raffle ticket drive. He also managed to get corporates such as Accra Brewery, Interplast Ghana, Vodafone Ghana and Zen Petroleum involved in supporting Ghana Rugby. In collaboration with the Vodafone Ghana management team he staged a management motivational event using the values and principles of rugby to help Vodafone prepare its management for year ahead.\nHe has challenged the Government of Ghana on more than one occasion about support promised to minority sports such as rugby that has never been delivered. He remains a vocal critic of other government failures well beyond the realm of sport.\nAfter the 2015–16 Ghana Rugby Club Championship, Mensah, in the absence of a National Technical Director, appointed a four-man technical squad under his guidance to prepare the Ghana national men's sevens team for its Africa Rugby international commitment. The technical team consisting of Messrs. Simba Mangena (Head Coach of Conquerors SC), Clement Dennis (Player / Coach of Griffons RFC), Amuzuloh Salim (Head Coach of Cosmos Buffaloes RFC) and Dan Hoppe (Idas Sports RFC) put the squad of 25 players through a rigorous training programme that ended in April 2016. This was followed by Phase II of the preparation that started early May when a reduced squad of 16 players started camping in Accra.\n The final squad of 12 players who competed in the Africa Rugby \"Africa Cup West\" men's sevens tournament in Lome, Togo on 28 May 2016 consisted of: Dan Hoppe (Idas Sports RFC), Clement Dennis (Griffons RFC), Sani Alhassan (Captain)(Cosmos Buffaloes RFC), Alex Dorpenyo (Conquerors SC), Seidu Razak (Conquerors SC), Solomon Akumba (Cosmos Buffaloes RFC), Michael Acquaye (Conquerors SC), Calestus Bosoka (Conquerors SC), Emmanuel Kalos (Conquerors SC), Joseph Mensah (Griffons RFC), Erick Acquah (Griffons RFC) and Nasiru Aminu (Conquerors SC).\nThe Ghana Eagles, as the Ghana national Rugby team is known, managed to lift the Bronze or Third Place cup after it was ranked as number one based on the Pool results.\nFull Membership of World Rugby.\nOn 10 May 2017 the World Rugby Council approved the application by the Ghana Rugby Football Union as a full member union, bringing the total number to 104 full members and 17 associates.\nIn announcing the achievement World Rugby Chairman Bill Beaumont said: \"We are delighted to be welcoming Ghana as a full member of World Rugby. These are very exciting times for our sport with unprecedented growth and interest around the world. With today's announcement, we look forward to a strong, well-organised game in Ghana and we are glad that the union is now ready to join the global rugby family as a full member and continue its work growing the game in Africa.”\nOther Achievements in 2017.\nBesides for the promotion to Full Membership of World Rugby, Ghana Rugby also experienced a memorable year in other areas.\nWinner of Rugby Africa Regional Challenge - West 1.\nGhana Rugby was awarded the hosting rights for the 2017 Rugby Africa Regional Challenge - West 1 between Benin, Ghana and Togo in Accra, Ghana.\nGhana Rugby managed to win the tournament by beating Benin 46 - 5 and Togo 10 - 0 to lift the Regional Challenge Trophy.\nRanking on Rugby Africa Men's Sevens Log.\nGhana Rugby competed for the first time in the Rugby Africa Men's Sevens Tournament in Kampala-Uganda by beating Mauritius 26 to 0 to be placed 9th in the Africa Men's Sevens Tournament.\nThe competition was played between ten of Africa's best nations between 6 and 7 October 2017 in Kampala-Uganda.\nPromotion to Rugby Africa 2018 Bronze Cup.\nGhana Rugby ended 2017 on a high note when was promoted from the Rugby Africa Regional Challenge to the 2018 Rugby Africa Bronze Cup.\nThe announcement that was issued by Rugby Afrique said that the Rugby Africa Bronze Cup will take place from the 9th to 12 May in Accra, Ghana between Ghana, Lesotho, Mauritius and Rwanda.\nRe-election as President and Board Chairman of Ghana Rugby.\nOn 25 September 2017 Ghana Rugby elected a new Board and Officers based on a newly adopted Constitution. Mensah was elected as president and board member by the GRFU constitutional electorate and he was subsequently appointed as board chairman by the newly elected Board.\nWorld Rugby Chairman Bill Beaumont and the CEO of World Rugby, Brett Gosper, congratulated Mensah and the GRFU Board in a joint statement and said that they \"look forward to continuing to work with you and the Board going forward\".\nIn February 2020 he was re-elected President by the Ghana Rugby Football Union. He run unchallenged at a Special General Meeting and was also reappointed board chairman for a term spanning four years.\nGhana Rugby Football Union.\nThe Ghana Rugby football Union (GRFU) is the governing body for Rugby Union in Ghana.

The tour consisted of one Test, three One Day Internationals (ODIs) and two Twenty20 (T20) matches.\nNew Zealand won the tour's sole Test in Napier by an innings and 301 runs, setting new records for New Zealand's largest Test victory and Zimbabwe's biggest Test defeat. New Zealand won the ODI series 3–0, and the T20I series 2–0.\nThe second ODI was the first international match played in Whangarei, held at Cobham Oval.\nBackground.\nFor Zimbabwe, captained by Brendan Taylor the one-off Test was their first overseas since returning from their five-year absence from Test cricket. New Zealand, led by Ross Taylor, entered the Test as the eighth-ranked Test team by the International Cricket Council. Their most recent Test series had been a 1–1 draw in Australia.\nTest series.\nOnly Test.\nZimbabwe won the toss and put New Zealand into bat. Ross Taylor made an unbeaten sixth Test hundred just before stumps on day one. New Zealand collected 331 runs for the loss of five wickets, with half-centuries to Brendon McCullum (83) and Martin Guptill (51) helping set up a strong total. Playing their first away Test since the Centurion in March 2005, Zimbabwe's seamers failed to exploit favourable early conditions. Ross Taylor made a century and New Zealand was 5/331 at stumps.\nOnly 15.2 overs were bowled on the second day of the Test at McLean Park before light, but persistent, rain set in to make further play impossible. Ross Taylor retired hurt on 122*, and BJ Watling made unbeaten fifty, his second in Test cricket, as New Zealand was 5/392 at stumps.\nNew Zealand added another 103 runs in the first hour of play. After Watling (102*) made his first career century, as New Zealand declared at drinks for 7dec/495.\nThe New Zealand bowlers decimated the Zimbabwean batting line-up in its first innings. Zimbabwe was reduced to 5/20 at lunch, and dismissed for 51 in the 29th over, with Malcolm Waller (23) the only Zimbabwean to reach double figures. The New Zealand bowlers shared the wickets, with all four fast bowlers (Martin, Southee, Bracewell and Boult) claiming two wickets each. Leading by 444 runs, New Zealand enforced the follow-on.\nThe second innings started no better, as Zimbabwe was reduced to 5/12 shortly after tea, with Chris Martin taking three early wickets. Zimbabwe finally managed to compile some partnerships in the lower order, with Regis Chakabva (63) and Graeme Cremer (26) adding 63 for the seventh wicket. New Zealand ultimately dismissed Zimbabwe again inside extended play at the end of the day, for a score of 143. Chris Martin (6/26) and Doug Bracewell (3/26) were the leading bowlers in the second innings, and Martin was named man of the match, with match figures of 8/31.\nZimbabwe's first innings total of 51 set a new record for Zimbabwe's lowest completed innings total, breaking the previous mark of 54 set against South Africa in Cape Town in 2005, and was the lowest innings total ever conceded by New Zealand, breaking the previous mark of 59 which was also set against Zimbabwe in 2005 in Harare. The margin of an innings and 301 runs set a new record for the largest win in New Zealand's history, and the heaviest defeat in Zimbabwe's history,; in both cases, the previous record was an innings and 294 runs, set in that same 2005 match in Harare. It was only the third occasion of a team being twice bowled out inside a single day of a Test match, and the second time New Zealand had done it to Zimbabwe, the feat being previously achieved in the 2005 Harare Test.\nTwenty20 series.\n1st T20I.\nT20I debut Colin de Grandhomme (NZ)"

        "text": "In golf stroke mechanics, a drive, also known as a tee shot, is a long-distance shot played from the tee box, intended to move the ball a great distance down the fairway towards the green. \nLongest drives.\nThe top 115 longest hitters on the PGA tour in 2017 averaged a drive of 290 yards or over. Some of the biggest hitters on the female tour, such as Maude-Aimee Leblanc, average just below 280 yards. As of 2011, Watson had the longest average drive in professional golf, with an average drive of 315.2 yards, capable of generating a ball speed of 194 mph and drives of up to 370 yards.\nOn the 2019 PGA Tour, the average driving distance was 293.8 yards, a 2.3 yard drop attributed to weather conditions.\nMike Austin holds the world record for the longest drive in professional play, driving 515 yards at the Winterwood Golf Course in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 1974, blasting it 65 yards past the flag on the par-4 fifth. His golf swing, known as The Mike Austin Swing, is practiced and taught by current golf professionals. Other notable swings are Ben Hogan's swing, Jim Furyk's swing, and Tiger Woods' swing.\nGolf driving is big business in the United States and golf driving instruction is a multi-million-dollar business with many manuals and instructors offering their expertise to maximize the drives of their consumers.\nAccording to professionals, flexibility, technique and form are very important in a drive, as a flexible player is able to generate a longer drive by having the ability to swing with a wider arc to get the club up to a greater speed and thereby impart more momentum to the ball. Some of the world's longest drivers who are not professional golfers but compete in Long Drive contests such as the RE/MAX World Long Drive Championship, such as Jamie Sadlowski and Mike Dobbyn, are capable of regularly hitting a ball over 400 yards and over 220 mph.\nTwo-time World Long Drive champion Sadlowski is of average height and slight of build but is able to generate drive distances of up to 445 yards, far beyond those of some of the more powerfully built professional golfers, because of his unique flexibility and leanness of build. Motion Golf, a company that creates sophisticated 3D swing animations of players, has deduced that in his swing he rotates his shoulder 166 degrees, but his hips move only 49 degrees; Tiger Woods averages around 85 degrees in comparison. He claims that the secret behind his unusually long drive is to \"Think swing fast, not hard.\"\nHowever, the official world record holder, Mike Dobbyn, whose longest drive is a world record 551 yards, is 6 ft 8 in and a muscular 310 pounds, implying that raw power is also very important, particularly in the left shoulder and right pectoral (for a right-handed golfer) and in the twitch muscles on the left side.&lt;ref name=\"Research quarterly / American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation, and Dance\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the past RE/MAX winners, such as Sweden's Viktor Johansson, have also been at least 6 ft 5 in and near 300 pounds and five-time winner Jason Zuback was an amateur powerlifter.\nIn February 1971, astronaut Alan Shepard became the first person to golf anywhere other than Earth. He smuggled a golf club and two golf balls on board Apollo 14 with the intent to golf on the Moon."

He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Francisco Giants, Chicago White Sox, and San Diego Padres.\nCareer.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nIn 2011, after hitting .302 with 11 home runs and 58 RBI in 52 games for the San Jose Giants, Sánchez was promoted to the Fresno Grizzlies. Sánchez was called up to the majors for the first time on July 15, 2011.\nHe was selected to join the Giants' 2012 Opening Day roster as the backup catcher behind Buster Posey. Due to their pairing during Barry Zito's rehab stint at AAA in 2011, and their continued success together at the major-league level in 2012, he had been designated as Zito's personal catcher. On April 23, 2012, Sánchez hit his first career home run off of Dillon Gee. On May 6, 2012, Sánchez hit a pitch-hit, walk-off single against the Milwaukee Brewers despite a five-man infield. On May 21, Sánchez hit his second career homer in the top of the 14th inning, against the Brewers again, to help the Giants win 4–3.

On June 14, he was designated for assignment and outrighted to the Triple-A El Paso Chihuahuas. For the season, he had the third-slowest baserunning sprint speed of all major league players, at 22.9 feet/second.\nHe was non-tendered in the 2016 offseason, and signed a minor league contract with the Padres on December 13, 2016. He elected free agency on November 6, 2017.\nSan Francisco Giants (second stint).\nOn January 5, 2018, Sánchez returned to the San Francisco Giants organization on a minor league contract. He was released from the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats on May 27.\nDetroit Tigers.\nOn January 21, 2019, Sánchez signed a minor-league deal with the Detroit Tigers that included an invite to Spring Training.

However, he did not appear in a game for the team before he was traded.\nOn April 17, 2021, Sánchez was traded to the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball in exchange for future considerations. In 82 games, Sánchez slashed .247/.324/.495 with 18 home runs and 70 RBIs.\nFollowing the 2021 season, Sánchez was traded back to the Ottawa Titans of the Frontier League.

There were three pool rounds: \nThe second phase was a truncated double-elimination tournament. Four fencers advanced to the final round through the winners brackets and four more advanced via the repechage.\nThe final phase was a single elimination tournament with a bronze medal match.\nBouts in the round-robin pools were to 5 touches; bouts in the double-elimination and final rounds were to 10 touches."

        "text": "The men's sabre was one of eight fencing events on the fencing at the 1988 Summer Olympics programme. It was the twenty-first appearance of the event. The competition was held from 22 to 23 September 1988. 40 fencers from 18 nations competed. Nations had been limited to three fencers each since 1928. The event was won by defending champion Jean-François Lamour of France, the fourth man to successfully defend an Olympic title in the sabre and the 11th man overall to win multiple medals in the event. It was France's third victory in the event, matching the Soviet Union for second-most all-time (behind Hungary at 11 gold medals). Janusz Olech took silver, Poland's first medal in the event since 1968. Italian Giovanni Scalzo earned bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 21st appearance of the event, which is the only fencing event to have been held at every Summer Olympics. \nSix of the quarterfinalists from 1984 returned: gold medalist Jean-François Lamour of France, silver medalist Marco Marin of Italy, bronze medalist Peter Westbrook of the United States, and quarterfinal losers Pierre Guichot of France, Giovanni Scalzo of Italy, and Ioan Pop of Romania. Lamour's 1984 gold was discounted due to the Soviet-led boycott keeping out dominant powers Hungary and the Soviet Union, but Lamour had won the 1987 world championship with the Hungarians and Soviets competing; he was a serious contender to repeat. \nThe other two inter-Games world championships had been won by György Nébald of Hungary (1985) and Sergey Mindirgasov of the Soviet Union (1986). Also returning to Olympic competition after the boycott were 1980 bronze medalist Imre Gedővári of Hungary and finalists Vasil Etropolski and Khristo Etropolski, twins from Bulgaria.\nBolivia, Chinese Taipei, the Philippines, and South Korea each made their debut in the men's sabre. Italy made its 19th appearance in the event, most of any nation, having missed the inaugural 1896 event and the 1904 St. Louis Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1988 tournament used a three-phase format very similar to that of 1984. Unlike the foil and épée competitions, the sabre tournament kept the size of the second phase (double elimination) round at 16 fencers (compared to expanding to 32 for foil and épée).\nThe first phase was a multi-round round-robin pool play format; each fencer in a pool faced each other fencer in that pool once. There were three pool rounds: \nThe second phase was a truncated double-elimination tournament. Four fencers advanced to the final round through the winners brackets and four more advanced via the repechage.\nThe final phase was a single elimination tournament with a bronze medal match.\nBouts in the round-robin pools were to 5 touches; bouts in the double-elimination and final rounds were to 10 touches."

        "text": "The 1973 play-off for a place in the 1974 FIFA World Cup in West Germany, between the national football teams of the Soviet Union and Chile, is notable for the political circumstances that marked the second leg of the play-off on 21 November 1973. It was scheduled to take place in the Estadio Nacional de Chile in Santiago, the Chilean capital. There had been a coup d'état in Chile two months before, immediately after which people deemed undesirable to the new regime of Augusto Pinochet had been held captive and executed in the stadium. The Soviet Union asked FIFA to find a different venue in Chile; when agreement could not be reached, the Soviet team did not take the field and was disqualified from the tournament, giving the Chilean team a victory by walkover. However, the match was still organised by FIFA as normal, but without any away team present. Chile scored 1–0 in an empty goal, and then the referee blew the game off. Chile advanced to the 1974 World Cup, where they were eliminated in the first round.\nPolitical circumstances.\nSalvador Allende had been elected to power in Chile in 1970, but was overthrown by Augusto Pinochet in a coup d'état in September 1973, during which thousands of people deemed undesirable by the new regime were taken to the Estadio Nacional in Santiago, tortured and killed; this continued until 7 November. The football match between the Soviet Union and Chile in the same stadium was scheduled for 21 November.\nPrior qualification.\nSoviet Union.\nThe Soviet's qualification started on 13 October 1972 with a 1–0 loss to France, away in Paris. Five days later they faced the Republic of Ireland in Dublin and won 2–1. Their home matches were played in May 1973. On 13 May they won against the Irish by 1–0, and thirteen days later beat the French 2–0 with both goals coming in the last ten minutes. \nRather than having the worst record among group winners, placing Soviet Union in the play-off was simply decided through allocation to Group 9 - Europe (UEFA). \nDespite 32 UEFA nations participating in the qualifying group stage, UEFA oddly chose to allocate only three teams to 3 of the 9 groups, instead of having 8 groups of 4 teams.\nChile.\nChile was placed in Group 3 of the CONMEBOL qualification alongside Peru and Venezuela although the Venezuelans withdrew. On 29 April 1973 Chile was defeated 2–0 by the Peruvians in Lima. In the home game on 13 May 1973 Chile won 2–0, making both teams equal on points and goal difference. A play-off was held on neutral ground in Montevideo, Uruguay, where Chile triumphed 2–1 to face the Soviets.\nMatches.\nFirst leg.\nAfter the coup, the new regime had banned all Chileans from leaving the country: in addition due to its anti-communism it did not have a favourable view of the national team playing in the homeland of its staunch enemy. However, at the same time it was desirable to portray an image of normality, so the Pinochet regime let the national team travel on the condition that no one made political statements, since their relatives were under military surveillance. Some of the team members, like Véliz or Caszely, were politically close to the Allende government. In addition, the Soviet Union, an ally of the overthrown government, had condemned the military coup and did not recognise the new government, with which it broke diplomatic relations.\nAt Moscow airport no Chilean authority received the team. In addition, Elías Figueroa and Carlos Caszely were detained by the immigration authorities for alleged irregularities in their passports. Leonardo Véliz told the Chilean newspaper La Tercera that \"In Moscow, I was approached by a Chilean student from Lumumba University, the son of a communist militant. I told him to forget to return to Chile, because any red dye was going to be a danger to his integrity\".\nThe first leg was played in Moscow on 26 September, two weeks after the coup, which brought a political dimension to the match. The Soviet authorities banned the entry of journalists and cameras into the stadium. It was a very tense game that was almost cancelled due to rumours of arrests of Chilean players in exchange for the release of political prisoners. The final result was a goalless draw.\nThe Soviet government and media were humiliated by the result, hoping for an easy victory on home soil.\nSecond leg.\nIn the face of criticism of the regime regarding abuses against detainees, the Football Federation of Chile suggested other scenarios, but the military junta, in an effort to improve the climate of opinion, insisted on demonstrating normality and at the same time defeating communism playing on home ground. The Russians demanded to play the game in a neutral country, which both Chile and FIFA rejected.\nFIFA established a commission that inspected the National Stadium, which had been prepared for the occasion but which still had about 7,000 detainees. According to testimony of Gregorio Mena Barrales, a politician imprisoned in that stadium, that commission \"visited the field, walked around the court, looked with distant eyes at the prisoners and gave the opinion: In the stadium you could play.\" While the FIFA commission examined the stadium, the detainees were hidden inside. Before the match, the detainees were transferred to a detention site in the Atacama Desert.\nBut the Soviets never travelled, claiming political and security issues, arguing that the National Stadium was an illegal detention centre where more than 7000 political prisoners were crowded and where many dissidents were tortured after the coup d'état against Salvador Allende. The USSR's decision was supported by several of its allied countries, especially by East Germany which was already qualified and threatened not to appear at the World Cup event. The Soviets sent a letter to FIFA explaining that \"For moral considerations, Soviets can not at this time play in the stadium of Santiago, splashed with the blood of the Chilean patriots\".\nChile demanded a compensation of $300,000 if the Soviets did not appear, claiming that they could not place the tickets for sale and the cost of preparing the game. FIFA declared the match a 2–0 walkover victory for Chile. However, FIFA arranged for the match to be held anyway. The match was attended by only 15,000 people. The game lasted 30 seconds, which took the Chilean team to score a goal from the kickoff. When they arrived in the area, as they had agreed, it was the captain, Francisco \"Chamaco\" Valdés, who scored the empty goal.\nIn later years, some members of the Soviet team stated that they thought that their government did not want to lose to a country with a different political ideology and that instead they won a moral victory in the eyes of the world.\nAftermath.\nChile.\nThe Chileans were drawn alongside the hosts West Germany and two first-time entrants: East Germany and Australia. In the first game, Chile lost 1–0 to West Germany, the goal being scored by Paul Breitner in the first half. Sergio Ahumada equalised for Chile in the second game to draw against the East Germans, but a 0–0 draw to Australia eliminated Chile from the World Cup. The two German teams advanced.\nSoviet Union.\nA period of decline started for the Soviets as they also missed out on the 1978 FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championships of 1976 and 1980."

It was the fifth tournament final to feature two teams from the same association, the second all-Spanish final and the first between teams from the same city. Real Madrid won the match 4–1 after extra time, with goals from Gareth Bale, Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo following a 93rd-minute header by Sergio Ramos, which cancelled out Diego Godín's first-half goal. In doing so, Real Madrid secured a record 10th title in the competition, 12 years after their ninth victory.\nAs the winners, Real Madrid earned the right to play against 2013–14 UEFA Europa League winners Sevilla in the 2014 UEFA Super Cup.

The Portuguese capital also hosted the 2005 UEFA Cup Final at the Estádio José Alvalade, home of Benfica's local rivals and finalists Sporting CP, who lost 3–1 to CSKA Moscow.\nBackground.\nThis was the first final in the history of the competition to be disputed by two teams from the same city. It was also the second all-Spanish final, after the 2000 final between Real Madrid and Valencia, and the fifth final between teams from the same country, the others being 2003 (Italy), 2008 (England), and 2013 (Germany).\nReal Madrid reached a record 13th final after a 5–0 aggregate win against defending champions Bayern Munich, making it the first time the club had reached the final since they won their record ninth title in 2002. Previously they won finals in 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1966, 1998, 2000, and 2002, and lost in 1962, 1964, and 1981. This was also their 17th final in all UEFA club competitions, having also played in two Cup Winners' Cup finals (losing in 1971 and 1983) and two UEFA Cup finals (winning in 1985 and 1986). It was the fourth Champions League final for their current coach Carlo Ancelotti, who previously coached A.C. Milan to victories in 2003 and 2007 and defeat in 2005, equalling the record shared by Miguel Muñoz, Marcello Lippi and Alex Ferguson. He joined Bob Paisley as the only manager to have won three titles, and also became the fifth manager to win titles with two clubs, after Ernst Happel, Ottmar Hitzfeld, José Mourinho and Jupp Heynckes.\nAtlético Madrid, who a week earlier had won their first La Liga title since 1996, reached their second European Cup final, 40 years after their first, after defeating 2012 champions Chelsea 3–1 on aggregate. This is the longest wait between finals, eclipsing the 38-year wait by Inter Milan (1972–2010). Atlético Madrid's only previous European Cup final in 1974 ended in defeat to Bayern Munich after a replay. Atlético Madrid have also played in three Cup Winners' Cup finals (winning in 1962, and losing in 1963 and 1986) and two Europa League finals (winning in 2010 and 2012), with their most recent Europa League triumph in 2012 led by current coach Diego Simeone. He had the chance to join fellow Argentinians Luis Carniglia and Helenio Herrera as the only non-European coaches to win the European Cup/Champions League. Had they won the final, they would have become the first Spanish club and the fifth club overall to have won all three pre-1999 major European trophies (European Cup/Champions League, UEFA Cup/Europa League and the now-defunct Cup Winners' Cup).\nThe only previous Madrid derby matches in European competitions were in the 1958–59 European Cup semi-finals, where Real Madrid defeated Atlético Madrid 2–1 in a replay, after a 2–2 aggregate draw. In the 2013–14 season, Atlético Madrid defeated Real Madrid 1–0 away and drew 2–2 at home in La Liga, while Real Madrid eliminated Atlético Madrid in the Copa del Rey semi-finals, winning 3–0 at home and 2–0 away.\nRoad to the final.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\"\nPre-match.\nAmbassador.\nFormer Portugal international player Luís Figo, who won the Champions League with Real Madrid in 2002, was named as the ambassador for the final.\nLogo.\nUEFA unveiled the visual identity of the final on 29 August 2013, the same day as the group stage draw. The design concept was inspired by elements from the Portuguese discoveries, namely the armillary sphere and the windrose, which were important instruments used by Portuguese sea explorers to measure the position of stars.\nTicketing.\nThe international ticket sales phase for the general public ran from 10 to 21 March 2014. Tickets were available in four price categories: €390, €280, €160, and €70.\nThe two finalist clubs were each allocated 16,970 tickets by UEFA. Atlético made 14,000 tickets available to club members, with a limit of one ticket per member. Real Madrid received 24,103 requests from 73,314 club members for a total of 13,134 tickets; due to the high demand, the tickets were awarded by means of a draw.\nOfficials.\nDutch referee Björn Kuipers was named by UEFA on 7 May 2014 as the referee for the final. He has previously taken charge of the 2011 UEFA Super Cup, the 2013 UEFA Europa League Final, and the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup Final. He became the fourth Dutch referee in a European Cup/Champions League final, after Leo Horn (1957, 1962), Charles Corver (1978), and Dick Jol (2001). The rest of the refereeing team are fellow countrymen Sander van Roekel and Erwin Zeinstra as assistant referees, Pol van Boekel and Richard Liesveld as additional assistant referees, Angelo Boonman as reserve assistant referee, and Turkey's Cüneyt Çakır as the fourth official.\nRelated events.\nThe UEFA Champions League and UEFA Women's Champions League trophies were handed over to the host city of Lisbon at a ceremony held at the City Hall, on 17 April 2014. The Mayor of Lisbon António Costa received the silverware from the hands of UEFA President Michel Platini, who justified the decision to stage the 2014 UEFA Champions League showpiece match in Lisbon with the fact that it had \"been too long since the final had been in Portugal\" and for \"the passion and love of football the Portuguese have.\" The title holders of both competitions were represented at the event by Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and midfielder Xherdan Shaqiri, and Wolfsburg defender Lina Magull. Also in attendance were Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) President Fernando Gomes and final ambassador Luís Figo. Upon their arrival to Lisbon and before the ceremony, the trophies were paraded by old tram through the city in the hands of trophy tour ambassadors Vítor Baía, former Portuguese international and Porto goalkeeper, and Mónica Jorge, former coach of the women's national team.\nThe annual UEFA Champions Festival took place from 22 to 25 May 2014 at Praça do Comércio in the city centre.\nThe 2014 UEFA Women's Champions League final was held on 22 May 2014 at Estádio do Restelo, featuring Swedish side Tyresö and defending champions Wolfsburg. Losing 2–0 at half-time, Wolfsburg made a comeback to win the match 4–3. Martina Müller, who scored the winner in the previous final, repeated the feat to secure the German team's second consecutive title.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe ceremony preceding the kick-off was organised by Canadian company Circo de Bakuza, with artistic direction by London-based choreographer Wanda Rokicki. She was responsible for the artistic segments of large international sporting events, such as the 2004 Summer Olympics, the 2010 FIFA World Cup, and the 2002 and 2006 Commonwealth Games.\nConceived \"to honor Portuguese tradition, including naval history or the art of tiling\", the show required six months of preparation and involved a total of 400 volunteers, 90 singers and 84 large-sized banners.\nThe UEFA Champions League anthem was interpreted by Portuguese fado singer Mariza.\nMatch.\nTeam selection.\nThe only player suspended from the final was Real Madrid's Xabi Alonso, who picked up his third booking of the competition in the second leg of the semi-final. In his place, Carlo Ancelotti selected German midfielder Sami Khedira, who himself had only recently returned from injury. Pepe was also left out of the starting XI, with 21-year-old French centre-back Raphaël Varane playing instead. Real Madrid's front three of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema were originally doubtful for the match, but all three overcame injuries to start the match.\nAtlético captain Gabi returned from a one-match European suspension, while striker Diego Costa was included in the starting line-up, having undergone horse placenta treatment for a hamstring injury suffered in the last league match the previous Saturday. However, despite initial optimism, midfielder Arda Turan did not recover in time after suffering an injury in the same game.\nKits.\nAtlético Madrid wore shirts with the name of their former player and manager Luis Aragonés inside the collar following his death in February 2014, with the symbolism approved by UEFA President Michel Platini. Both teams wore their home kits for the final, as they do in domestic meetings.\nSummary.\nWithin eight minutes, Atlético striker Diego Costa was forced to come off because of his previous injury. Gareth Bale had Real's best chance just after the half-hour mark and it was only a few minutes later when Atlético punished this miss. When Atlético received a corner, it was routinely cleared by the Real Madrid defence, but only as far as the head of Juanfran, who headed the ball back into the penalty area and onto the head of Diego Godín, who caught Iker Casillas off his line with a looping header to make it 1–0 to Atlético on 36 minutes.\nThe second half saw Real pushing forward as they went in search of an equaliser to deny Atlético's first Champions League title, with manager Carlo Ancelotti making a double substitution to replace Fábio Coentrão and Khedira with Marcelo and Isco. Atlético defended with all players and Real missed several chances. Atletico's defence was finally breached in the third minute of stoppage time, after the regulation 90 minutes, by a pinpoint Sergio Ramos header into the left of the net from Luka Modrić's corner from the right. The match went on to extra time with no substitutions left for either team.\nReal Madrid became even more dominant in extra time, which proved decisive after Ángel Di María's run on the left flank saw him dribble past three Atlético defenders and shoot at goal. Thibaut Courtois attempted to block the Argentine's shot but only managed to deflect the ball to Bale, who headed the rebound in from two yards out to put Real ahead for the first time, in the 110th minute. Real then added two late goals to the scoreline, starting with Marcelo's low left foot strike from just inside the penalty area in the 118th minute. At the end of extra time, Cristiano Ronaldo was fouled by Gabi for a penalty, which he converted into the left corner of the net for a record 17th goal in the tournament. During the celebration for Ronaldo's goal, Varane kicked the ball towards Atlético manager Diego Simeone, who then ran onto the pitch in anger. Simeone was sent off and Varane booked for the incident.\nThis was the seventh UEFA Champions League final (not including the finals up to 1992, when it was known as the European Champion Clubs' Cup) to go into extra time and the first to be solved during this period, without the need for a penalty shoot-out. It was also the second highest-scoring final in the tournament's history as the Champions League, after the 3–3 draw between Milan and Liverpool in 2005, and provided the second biggest winning margin, behind Milan's 4–0 win over Barcelona in 1994.\nDetails.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "title": "New Zealand cricket team in Australia in 2011–12",
        "text": "The New Zealand cricket team toured Australia from 18 November – 13 December 2011. The tour consisted of two Tests played for the Trans-Tasman Trophy.\nThe series was drawn 1–1, so the trophy was retained by Australia. New Zealand's win in the second Test in Hobart was its first Test win in Australia since 1985, and their first test match victory against Australia since 1993 and their most recent to date.\nTest Series (Trans-Tasman Trophy).\n1st Test.\nThree Australia players, opening batsman David Warner and fast bowlers James Pattinson and Mitchell Starc, made their Test debuts in this match, after injuries to five players (batsmen Shane Watson and Shaun Marsh, and fast bowlers Ryan Harris, Mitchell Johnson and Pat Cummins), all of whom played in Australia's 1–1 series tie against South Africa earlier that month.\nNew Zealand won the toss and chose to bat. Australia had the upper hand in the morning session, reducing New Zealand to 4/94 at lunch, with only Brendon McCullum (34) making more than twenty. A fifth wicket fell just after lunch, before Dean Brownlie and Daniel Vettori stabilised the innings. The pair added eighty runs without loss before play was called off due to rain and bad light before tea. New Zealand was 5/176 at stumps.\nBrownlie (77*) and Vettori (96) continued at the start of Day 2, extending their sixth wicket partnership to 158 runs before Vettori was run out. New Zealand collapsed from 5/254 to 8/259, before being dismissed for 295 just before lunch. Nathan Lyon cleaned up the tail, and finished with four wickets for Australia.\nNew Zealand dismissed the Australian openers cheaply to reduce Australia to 2/25 early in the afternoon session, but Australia recovered to reach 3/154 when stumps were drawn on Day 2, again early due to bad light.\nAustralia added 100 runs for the loss of two wickets in the morning session, including Ricky Ponting (78). The new ball taken almost immediately after the lunch break, and Michael Clarke (139) and Brad Haddin (80) survived to add 108 runs for the sixth wicket before Clarke's dismissal. Haddin then batted with the tail, and Australia added another 82 runs for the last four wickets, the most notable contribution coming from Mitchell Starc (32*). Australia was dismissed for 427, a lead of 132, with seven overs remaining in the day. Chris Martin was the top wicket-taker with three.\nNew Zealand lost McCullum (1) in the final over of the day's play, and finished at 1/10.\nIn the first hour of Day 4, debutant fast bowler James Pattinson (5/27) dismissed the entire New Zealand top order to reduce the Black Caps to 5/28. Pattinson took the first five wickets of the innings, including McCullum (1) on Day 3, then Martin Guptill (12), Kane Williamson (0), Ross Taylor (0) and nightwatchman Doug Bracewell (2). Australia went on to dismiss New Zealand for 150 midway through the afternoon session; Dean Brownlie (42) was the top scorer.\nNeeding only 19 runs for victory, Australia made the runs inside three overs for the loss of one wicket. Debutant David Warner scored the winning runs.\nJames Pattinson (1/64 &amp; 5/27) was voted Man of the Match.\n2nd Test.\nUncapped fast bowler Trent Boult was brought into the New Zealand team to replace Daniel Vettori, who pulled out late with an injury. The Australian team was unchanged from the first Test.\nAfter winning the toss on a very green pitch, Australian captain Michael Clarke elected to field on Day 1. The Australian bowlers dominated play on Day 1, dismissing New Zealand for 150 at tea, with only Dean Brownlie (56) managing more than twenty runs. Australia had reduced New Zealand to 6/60 in the morning session, but Brownlie's partnerships with Doug Bracewell (45 runs for the seventh wicket) and Tim Southee (41 runs for the eighth wicket) helped New Zealand to a score of 150. James Pattinson (5/51) was the top wicket taker, and took five wickets for the second consecutive innings; Peter Siddle took three wickets.\nAustralia faced only 4.2 overs, reaching 1/12, before rain stopped play.\nWith the pitch still green and assisting the fast bowlers, New Zealand dominated Day 2 just as Australia had Day 1. Chris Martin (3/46) dismissed the Australian top three, and Bracewell (3/20) and Trent Boult (3/29) also took three wickets apiece, as Australia was reduced to 7/75 before being dismissed for 136 late in the afternoon session. A 56-run partnership between tail-enders Siddle (36) and Pattinson (17) provided the only resistance for Australia. This gave New Zealand a 14-run lead on the first innings.\nNew Zealand reached tea without loss, before losing both openers in quick succession after tea to fall to 2/36. In conditions which still suited the bowlers, New Zealand added 103 runs for the loss of only one wicket for the rest of the day, finishing at 3/139 at stumps.\nAfter dismissing Kane Williamson (34) in the first over of the day, Australia took New Zealand's seven remaining wickets for only 87 runs in the morning session. Nathan Lyon (3/26), James Pattinson (3/54) and Peter Siddle (3/66) took three wickets each. Other than Williamson and top-scorer Ross Taylor (56), there were few strong contributions from New Zealand's batsmen. Debutant Trent Boult (21 from 13 balls) helped to add 23 runs for the tenth wicket to extend New Zealand's score to 226, and set Australia a target of 241 for victory.\nIn a rain-interrupted afternoon and evening, Australia faced 19 overs, and openers Phillip Hughes and David Warner reached stumps without loss, with the score 0/72.\nPlay started with Australia requiring 169 runs to win with ten wickets in hand. Hughes (20) was dismissed in the first over, but Warner and Usman Khawaja (23) added another fifty runs for the second wicket, before Khawaja was dismissed with the score 2/122. Australia took the score to 2/159, before Doug Bracewell took three wickets for no score to reduce Australia to 5/159. Australia went to lunch at 5/173, requiring 68 runs with five wickets in hand.\nShortly after lunch, Warner made his maiden Test century, and he and Brad Haddin (15) took the score to 5/192, before two wickets apiece to Tim Southee (2/77) and Doug Bracewell in consecutive overs reduced Australia to 9/199, requiring 42 runs from the last wicket for victory. Opener David Warner and number eleven Nathan Lyon batted together for 8.4 overs, with Lyon twice surviving DRS referrals for lbw appeals. Finally, after a 34 run partnership for the tenth wicket, Lyon (9) was bowled by Bracewell (6/40). Australia was all out for 233, and New Zealand won the match by seven runs. It was New Zealand's first victory against Australia in a test since 1992–93, and its first in Australia since 1985–86. David Warner (123*) carried his bat, one of very few batsmen to achieve the feat in a fourth innings.\nDavid Warner won the Man of the Match award for his 123* in the fourth innings. On a difficult batting pitch, his score was more than double the next highest (56, by Brownlie and Taylor).\nPlayer of the Match controversy.\nFor this series, Cricket Australia chose to allow the Player of the Match to be voted for by users within Australia of a phone app promoted on the Nine Network coverage by Vodafone, the telecommunications company sponsoring the series. This proved controversial in the second Test when Australian batsman David Warner (123*) easily won the award ahead of New Zealand bowler Doug Bracewell (3/20 &amp; 6/40), whose bowling was a big key to the New Zealand victory; votes for Warner outnumbered votes for Bracewell by more than two to one, and home-country favouritism among voters was blamed. Cricket Australia abandoned the voting system after the series, and reverted to the traditional method of having the Player of the Match chosen by a panel of experts."

        "title": "Indian cricket team in Australia in 2011–12",
        "text": "The Indian cricket team toured Australia from 15 December 2011 to 28 February 2012. The tour included four Tests to contest the Border–Gavaskar Trophy (which was held by India at the start of the tour), two Twenty20s (T20Is), and eight ODIs as part of the Commonwealth Bank Tri-Series which also involved Sri Lanka.\nAustralian won the four Test series in a 4–0 whitewash to regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Australian captain Michael Clarke was named the player of the series, having scored 626 runs at an average of 125.20. In the second Test match, Clarke, with 329 not out, scored the 25th triple century in Test match cricket. The third Test match saw David Warner bring up a century in just 69 deliveries, setting a new record for the fastest Test century by an opening batsman. In the fourth Test, Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke compiled a fourth wicket partnership of 386 runs, the highest partnership in Tests between Australia and India, or in Tests at the Adelaide Oval. Following the Test series, The T20I series was held which was drawn 1–1. The tour concluded with the ODI tri-series with India finishing last in the ODI tri-series, with three wins, one tie and four losses from its eight ODIs and did not make it to the best of three finals.\nBackground.\nBy mid-2011, the Indian cricket team was enjoying unprecedented success, winning the 2011 Cricket World Cup held at home, while also being the No. 1 Test team, which they had achieved in 2009. They proved to be undefeatable at home as always, but also enjoyed success away, especially beyond the subcontinent such as in South Africa in late 2010, where for the first time ever, the Indian cricket team did not lose a Test series there. The team, led by wicketkeeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni, was widely praised by media and former cricketers, and Dhoni's captaincy was also considered by some experts to be one of the reasons for India's success. However, this success was turned upside down in their tour to England in 2011. It was widely expected that India would win the Test and ODI series there, by light of their recent success. However, their weaknesses in their bowling and batting were completely exposed by the Englishmen and they lost all the 4 Tests, losing their No. 1 Test status to England. Despite the debacle in England, it was widely expected that India would retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after the series in Australia, as the team's previous 2 tours Down Under were ok with achieving 2 test victories and that the Australian cricket team was now quite weak. Also the nucleus of the Indian side selected for the tour had a number of players who had a good record in Australia. India had most recently won a five-match ODI home series against England 5–0 in October and a three-Test home series against the West Indies 2–0 in November, further improving expectations.\nThe Australian team, however, was undergoing a period of transition, with many of their successful players like Shane Warne, Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden and Glenn McGrath having retired a couple of years prior and former captain and batting mainstay Ricky Ponting woefully out-of-form. The team was now captained by Michael Clarke and had many inexperienced players. Australia's recent record was not inspiring, meekly losing the Ashes series, not going to the semifinals of the Cricket World Cup for the first time since 1992, and drawing two prior Test series against South Africa away and against New Zealand at home. Their coach Tim Nielsen had been sacked and replaced with former South African coach Mickey Arthur. Not many cricket experts and media, even in Australia, were expecting an Australian resurgence against a very formidable India.\nAlso, this was batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar's fifth series in Australia, having been a member of the Indian side in its previous tours Down Under in 1991, 1999, 2003 and 2007. At the beginning of the tour, Tendulkar had scored 99 centuries in international cricket; the tour gave him the opportunity to become the first player in the history of the sport to reach score his hundredth century.\nIndia made two changes to its bowling attack from the third test of the West Indies series, with pacemen Zaheer Khan and Umesh Yadav replacing paceman Varun Aaron and spinner Pragyan Ojha, and fielding an unchanged batting lineup. Harbhajan Singh, who had previously taken the wicket of Ponting ten times in his career, was not selected.\nIn the Limited Overs squad, Praveen Kumar returned to the squad after recovering from a fractured rib. Sachin Tendulkar was also in the squad, although he had not played an ODI since the final of the World Cup in April 2011.\nAustralian T20I captain Cameron White was dropped from the T20I team due to poor form at domestic level; he was replaced in the team, and replaced as captain, by George Bailey, who made his international debut. Australian spinner Brad Hogg came out of retirement at the age of 41 to play the T20Is.\nTest series (Border-Gavaskar Trophy).\nTrophy background.\nEntering the series, India held the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after winning the previous two Test series between the countries, both of which were held in India: 2–0 from four Tests in 2008–09, and 2–0 from two Tests in 2010–11.\nDecision Review System (DRS).\nThe series was played without the players having access to the decision review system (DRS). At the time, the DRS could be used in any Test series at the agreement of both participating cricket boards, but the Board of Control for Cricket in India opposed its use in this series. Umpires could still initiate reviews to the third umpire for run out, stumping and no ball decisions.\n1st Test.\nMatch Report:\nAustralia won the toss and batted first. Play was interrupted for around forty minutes after the lunch break, but only one over was lost after the day's play was extended. Ed Cowan scored 68 runs on debut; Ricky Ponting scored 62. Australia suffered a middle order collapse, falling at one stage from 3/205 to 6/214, but Australia steadied to reach 6/277 at the end of Day 1. Television replays and technology cast doubt on the umpires' decisions to dismiss Cowan and Michael Hussey caught behind on the first day. A total of over 70,000 people attended the Melbourne Cricket Ground for the first day of the Boxing Day Test.\nAustralia reached 333 before being bowled out before lunch. India started well in its first innings, with three of its senior batsmen — Virender Sehwag (67), Rahul Dravid (68) and Sachin Tendulkar (73) — making half-centuries before Peter Siddle claimed Tendulkar's wicket in the last over of the day's play, with India 214/3 at stumps.\nIndia then suffered a batting collapse on the third morning, losing 7/68 in the morning session to be bowled out for 282. Ben Hilfenhaus collected the first five-wicket haul of his Test career (5/75).\nAustralia took a 51-run lead into the second innings, but suffered a top order collapse, falling to 4/27.

It was Pattinson's second player of the match award in only the third Test match of his career.\n2nd Test.\nMatch Report:\nBoth teams were unchanged. India won the toss and chose to bat. The Australian bowlers dominated the Indian batsman, who lost wickets regularly through the day. The half-century partnership between Ravichandran Ashwin (20) and top-scorer MS Dhoni (57*) for the seventh wicket provided the only resistance, and India was dismissed for 191 after tea. James Pattinson (4/43) was the top bowler for Australia, taking the wickets of four of India's top five batsmen.\nIn reply, the Australian top order collapsed to 3/37, with Zaheer Khan taking all three wickets and at one point on a hat-trick.

Clarke reached his first Test double century after the tea break, and finished the day 251*.\nClarke (329*) and Hussey (150*) continued to bat through the morning, and Clarke reached the twenty-fifth Test triple century after the lunch break. Clarke eventually declared midway through the afternoon session at 4/659, for a lead of 468 runs. The unbroken partnership between Clarke and Hussey was worth 334 runs. The innings of Clarke is the highest score by an Australian Test skipper on home soil, surpassing the Donald Bradman's 270 at Melbourne in 1937.\nAfter losing Virender Sehwag (4) early, Gautam Gambhir and Rahul Dravid (29) added 82 runs for the second wicket, before Dravid was dismissed late in the day. India finished 2/114 at stumps, with Ben Hilfenhaus taking both third day wickets for Australia.\nIndia added 129 runs for the loss of only Gambhir (83) in the morning session to go to lunch at 3/243.

Australia bowled well, and was able to take wickets regularly to dismiss India for 161 shortly after the tea break. VVS Laxman (31) and top scorer Virat Kohli (44) compiled the only half-century partnership (68 runs for the fifth wicket), and India lost its final six wickets for only thirty runs. The Australian bowlers shared the wickets, with Ben Hilfenhaus (4/43) recording the best figures, and Peter Siddle taking three wickets. Australia limited India's run rate to only 2.66 runs per over.\nIn reply, Australia raced to 0/149 in just 23 overs before the close of play, at a run rate of 6.47 runs per over, with opener David Warner scoring a century from only 69 deliveries to finish on 104* at stumps; it set a new record for the fastest Test century by an opening batsman, breaking the previous record set by Chris Gayle (70 balls) at the same venue in 2009–10.

The tournament was held in Australia from 5 February 2012 to 8 March 2012, and consisted of a round robin stage, in which each nation played each of the others four times. The top two teams at the end of the round robin stage then participated in a best-of-three finals series.\nIn a close round robin, Sri Lanka and Australia qualified for the finals series, each with 19 points in the group stage; India finished last with 15 points, and did not qualify for the finals. Australia went on to beat Sri Lanka 2–1 in the finals.\nFor information about the tournament, including match results, see 2011–12 Commonwealth Bank Series.\nAftermath.\nThe Indian cricket team, humiliated in all forms of the game in the tour, was the subject of ridicule from the media and former cricketers. \"The Australian\" wrote under the headline \"India's pillars of strength reduced to useless rubble\" Dhoni is not the only shaky pillar of what only eight months ago was the number one cricket nation in the world. VVS Laxman, once the scourge of Australian bowlers, is being flayed himself at home after scores of 2,1, 2, 66, 31 and 0. Virender Sehwag, who warmed up for this series by scoring the fastest double century in One-Day International history, also is trending south faster than Scott and Amundsen, having followed up his whirlwind 67 in Melbourne with innings of 7, 30, 4, 0 and 10. Worst of all, Dhoni has failed with the bat. The Indian captain is no thunderer at the best of times – neither is coach Duncan Fletcher, which may be part of the problem – but how can he demand more of his batsmen when he has nowhere to hide behind scores of 6, 23, 57no, 2, 12 and 2? India has not had a single century-maker in the past three Tests, The Daily Telegraph said that India's performance was \"so bad that the first question that came Michael Clarke's way at the press conference was 'did it feel as if you were playing Bangladesh?'\". The newspaper also played up Dhoni's one-match ban due to the Indian team's slow over-rate in the third Test. Under the headline 'Dhoni dumped from Adelaide Test', the newspaper wrote, \"India's shambolic tour of Australia plunged into unprecedented disarray when their captain MS Dhoni was sensationally banned from playing in the final Test due to slow over rates\". The Herald Sun wrote about how Australia built up a team after the Ashes humiliation last year while sarcastically mentioning the visiting players skipping practice sessions in the tour.As painful as it was, getting flogged in last year's Ashes may be remembered as the recession Australia had to have. Nothing is being taken for granted in Australian cricket any more. The new coaching unit is working well under head coach Mickey Arthur and Australia has worked hard to freshen up every aspect of its game. India, by contrast, just lobs along, its players pocketing millions each year and too spoilt to make major sacrifices. It's appropriate that many Indian players spent a lot of time last week sitting under trees at training, because their entire Test match game is being left in the shade.\nThe Indian tour to Australia was the last international series for Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman. Dravid announced his retirement from international cricket soon after the tour and Laxman announced his retirement after he was selected for the two match home series against New-Zealand in August 2012."

The team has been a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference since the conference's founding in the 1954 season. The program's home venue is the Durham Bulls Athletic Park, which opened in 1995. Chris Pollard has been the head coach of the team since the 2013 season. As of the end of the 2019 season, the Blue Devils have appeared in three College World Series and 10 NCAA tournaments. They have won three ACC Championships. As of the start of the 2021 Major League Baseball season, 36 former Blue Devils players have played in Major League Baseball.\nHistory.\nThe baseball program began varsity play in 1889. Led by Arthur Bradsher's 13–1 record they won the S.I.A.A. championship in 1904. The Trinity hurler struck out 169 batters during that championship season and walked only four batters the entire season.\nThe vast majority of the program's successes came under head coaches Jack Coombs and Ace Parker from 1929–1966. Coombs led the Blue Devils to five Southern Conference championships and to a fifth-place finish in the 1952 College World Series. Taking over upon Coombs' retirement after the 1952 season, Parker led Duke to the 1953 and 1961 College World Series, one Southern Conference championship, and three Atlantic Coast Conference championships. In 2016, Duke earned their first bid to the NCAA tournament since their 1961 College World Series run, ending a 55-year drought. Head coach Chris Pollard continued this success, leading the Blue Devils to the NCAA Super Regionals in 2018 and 2019. In 2021, the Blue Devils defeated NC State at the 2021 ACC tournament, winning their first ever ACC Championship.\nSteroid controversy.\nIn 2005, the program was the target of a controversy involving the use of anabolic steroids. Five former players told the Duke Chronicle that head coach Bill Hillier had pressured players to use steroids, with two of those players admitting to having injected steroids in 2002. In an open letter published in the Chronicle, another former player, Evan Anderson, confirmed that Hillier had pressured players to use steroids. While Hillier denied the accusations, he was replaced as head coach after the 2005 season.\nIndividual awards.\nACC Baseball Player of the Year\nACC Baseball Coach of the Year "

A native of Swaledale, Iowa, he batted right-handed but threw left-handed.\nAfter playing American Legion Baseball and excelling on Rockwell-Swaledale High School's baseball team, Eddy was signed by the White Sox in 1965. Two years of service in the United States Army interrupted his minor league career, but he was called up by the White Sox in 1970. A member of their Opening Day roster in 1971, he posted a list of White Sox left-handers on his locker door, crossing names off each time he thought he had passed them on the depth chart. Optioned to the minor leagues in June, he rejoined the team for three games in September, his last in the major leagues. Overall, he had an 0–2 record and a 2.36 earned run average. Traded to the San Diego Padres in 1972, he finished his professional career in 1973.\nEarly life.\nDonald Eugene Eddy was born on October 25, 1946, in Mason City, Iowa, though his hometown was nearby Swaledale. His parents were Elmer and Lorraine Eddy. Elmer had once been a baseball player himself, pitching, catching, and playing the outfield in the St. Louis Cardinals system until he started serving in the United States Marine Corps during World War II. After the war, he joined his brothers to run a hardware, lumber, and propane gas business in Swaledale. He was very much involved in his son's development as a ballplayer, forbidding Don to throw a curveball until he reached high school, as he was afraid the pitch might damage his son's arm.\nAt Rockwell-Swaledale High School, Don Eddy excelled on the baseball team. He lettered each year on the basketball team, ranking among the scoring leaders in Northern Iowa in his final two years of school. During his high school years, Eddy also played American Legion Baseball. After three years on the Rockwell team, he joined Mason City's squad in his senior year. Pitching innings, Eddy had a 9–1 record, an 0.93 earned run average (ERA), and 139 strikeouts. Offensively, he batted .349, leading his team in that statistic as well as in home runs and runs batted in (RBI). Behind his contributions, Mason City made it all the way to the state championship game against Waterloo, where Eddy suffered his only loss. The Chicago White Sox signed him in 1965 as an amateur free agent, though he was expected to attend college for a semester before joining the organization.\nProfessional career.\nMinor leagues (1966–1970).\nEddy made his professional debut as a pitcher in 1966 with the Deerfield Beach Sun Sox, which moved to Winter Haven, Florida, during the season. The Sun Sox were a member of the Class A Florida State League. In 16 games, 12 of which were starts, he had a 4–8 record, a 2.07 ERA, 86 strikeouts, 43 walks, and 71 hits allowed in 100 innings pitched.\nHowever, Eddy spent the next two seasons in the United States Army. He did not pitch again until late in the 1968 season, when he pitched 15 innings for the Duluth–Superior Dukes of the Class A short season Northern League. In three games (two starts), he had a 1–1 record and a 3.60 ERA.\nIn 1969, Eddy had a historic season for the Appleton Foxes of the Class A Midwest League. Posting an 18–3 record, he led the league in wins, winning percentage (.857), ERA (1.81), placing third in strikeouts (140) and innings pitched (164). His 18 wins and 1.81 ERA were both franchise records. For his efforts, he was declared Appleton's Most Valuable Player (MVP). After the season, he pitched in the Florida Instructional League and also played winter ball in Venezuela with the goal of developing a better slider.\nAfter serving mostly as a starting pitcher in 1969, Eddy was used nearly exclusively as a relief pitcher with the Tucson Toros of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL) in 1970. His teammates jokingly nicknamed him \"The Vulture\", as he recorded several wins without having to throw as many innings as the starters. In 34 games (one start), he had a 10–4 record, nine saves, a 1.37 ERA, 36 strikeouts, 21 walks, and 41 hits allowed in 59 innings.\nChicago White Sox (1970–1971).\nOn September 3, 1970, Eddy joined the White Sox on his first Major League Baseball (MLB) callup. He made his MLB debut on September 7, pitching an inning of scoreless relief in a 7–5 loss to the Oakland Athletics in the second game of a doubleheader at Comiskey Park. In seven games as a rookie, he had no record, a 2.31 ERA, nine strikeouts, six walks, and 10 hits allowed in innings.\nEddy was a member of Chicago's Opening Day roster in 1971. After seeing him pitch in spring training, Chuck Tanner, the team's manager, said \"Eddy can be our most dependable pitcher in short relief\". He got his first MLB decision on April 16, when he gave up a 10th-inning home run to Reggie Jackson that was the difference-maker in a 5–4 loss to Oakland. On April 25, he suffered another loss in an eighth-inning appearance against the Boston Red Sox. After retiring the first two hitters he faced, he allowed a walk and two singles to load the bases, then walked Carl Yastrzemski to force in the deciding run in a 5–4 defeat.\nDuring the season, Eddy kept a list of the White Sox left-handed pitchers on his locker door, crossing names off each time he thought he thought he had passed one on the depth chart. \"It was a big joke in the clubhouse,\" recalled fellow left-hander Tommy John, who eventually saw his name crossed off the list. Eventually, Eddy found himself optioned to Tucson on June 18. Though he had posted what McAuley called a \"respectable\" 3.12 ERA in 19 games for Chicago, the White Sox wanted to call up Stan Perzanowski, who had a 9–0 record with Tucson.\nIn 24 games (four starts) for Tucson, Eddy had a 3–2 record, one save, a 6.85 ERA, 41 strikeouts, 34 walks, and 57 hits allowed in 46 innings. Recalled by Chicago in September, he appeared in three more games for the MLB team. The last of these came on September 30, when Eddy pitched two innings and had his only MLB plate appearance. He hit a double off of Bill Parsons of the Milwaukee Brewers, giving himself a perfect 1.000 batting average. In 22 games, he had an 0–2 record, a 2.38 ERA, 14 strikeouts, 19 walks, and 19 hits allowed in innings.\nMinor leagues (1972–1973).\nEddy was one of the last players cut from White Sox spring training in 1972, as he was reassigned to minor league camp on March 31. After starting the season at Tucson, he was sent to the San Diego Padres on July 16 as the player to be named later in an earlier trade for Ed Spiezio. In San Diego's organization, he pitched for the PCL's Hawaii Islanders. Baseball-Reference does not have complete statistics on his season.\nIn 1973, Eddy made 36 appearances with the Alexandria Aces of the Class AA Texas League. He had a 3–2 record, a 2.00 ERA, 58 strikeouts, 15 walks, and 49 hits allowed in 63 innings. By 1975, he was pitching for the Mason City Merchants in the North Central Amateur baseball league. After his career, Eddy joined the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association (MLBPAA). He would coach summer MLBPAA youth camps in Des Moines. He finished his MLB career with an 0–2 record, a 2.36 ERA, 23 strikeouts, 25 walks, and 29 hits allowed in innings pitched over 29 games.\nPitching style.\nEddy stood and weighed . Though a left-handed pitcher, he batted right-handed. His fastball was his best pitch. He also threw a slider and, in 1970, was working on developing a curveball. Regis McAuley, sports editor for the \"Tucson Daily Citizen\", thought Eddy was similar to Whitey Ford, both in stature as well as in his reliance on carefully thrown fastball. Eddy listed Ford among the left-handed pitchers he enjoyed watching on television growing up, along with Billy Pierce and Herb Score.\nPersonal life.\nOn September 10, 1966, Eddy married his high school girlfriend, Marilyn Jane Losee. The couple had two sons, Trent and Travis. She died on April 6, 1978. Two years later, Eddy remarried to Bernadette \"Bernie\" Hanna, a widow with one son, Charlie. A golfer, Eddy won seven club championships and had seven holes-in-one to his credit. He died at his Rockwell home on October 10, 2018, from pancreatic cancer."

        "text": "Bryan Williams (born September 17, 1987) is a former American football defensive back. He played college football at the University of Akron.\nEarly life.\nHe was born the son of Sterling Campbell.\nBryan attended Buchtel High School in Akron, Ohio. His football talents were good enough to earn him a 3-Star rating, according to Rivals.com. During his time at Buchtell, he was a three-year starter and also lettered as a freshman. He was named first team All-Ohio Division III running back after rushing for 1,897 yards and 26 touchdowns in 11 games as a senior. As a cornerback, compiled 52 tackles and eight interceptions, returning one for a TD. He compiled 17 career interceptions, and was named the Plain Dealer Defensive Player of the Year. He was also named first team All-Beacon Journal. In four varsity seasons, Williams helped Buchtel to three city championships, three state playoff berths and a 34-11 record (.756). He was named to the PrepStar All-Midwest Region, and was rated one of the top 75 players in the Midwest region by SuperPrep. Rated the No. 30 prospect in Ohio by Rivals.com, as well as a top 60 cornerback. Rated Ohio's No. 32 prospect by Scout.com. He played under Coach Claude Brown, and was also a four-time letterman in track and a member of the Academic Merit Roll.\nCollege career.\nValley Forge Military Academy.\nHe originally signed a letter of intent to play football at the University of Pittsburgh, but Williams failed to make it through the NCAA Clearinghouse and attended Valley Forge Military Academy. He also had offers from Akron, Minnesota, Kansas and Michigan State. After his first year at Valley Forge, he had once again signed to go to Pittsburgh, but was denied again. After he finished his 2nd year, he transferred to his local college, the University of Akron.\nAkron.\nWilliams saw extended time as Akron's starting running back in 2007. Williams was named third team All-Mid-American Conference both as a running back and return specialist in 2007. Despite being tabbed third team All-MAC as a running back in 2007, he moved to defense (strong safety) in the spring of 2008. He ranked second in the NCAA in kickoff return average and first in the MAC (31.90). His KOR average was additionally an Akron single-season record and ranked second on the MAC seasonal list (the record is 32.9 by Marshall's James Williams in 1999).\nProfessional career.\nCleveland Browns.\nWilliams was signed as an undrafted free agent in 2009, by the Cleveland Browns to a 3-year contract, but he lasted only 2 months with the team, before being cut.\nMarion Mayhem.\nAfter being cut by the Browns, Williams was signed by the Marion Mayhem, an indoor football team in the Continental Indoor Football League. The Mayhem lacked the financial ability to stay alive and folded with 4 games remaining in the 2010 season.\nFort Wayne FireHawks.\nWilliams then signed to finish out the season with the not too distant Fort Wayne Firehawks, as well as a few other Mayhem players, including Mike Tatum. The FireHawks made the CIFL playoffs, and lost in the first round to the Wisconsin Wolfpack. Williams started both games in which he played for the FireHawks.\nMarion Blue Racers.\nIn 2011, Williams was again signed by an indoor football team. This time it was the Marion Blue Racers, who were owned and operated by former Pittsburgh Steeler LaMonte Coleman. The Blue Racers finished the regular season 8-2. Williams was named the CIFL's Defensive Player of the Week in Week 3. Williams led the league with 9 interceptions. The team would advance to the CIFL Championship Game, only to lose to the undefeated Cincinnati Commandos.\nPittsburgh Power.\nOn July 8, 2011, Bryan Williams signed with the Pittsburgh Power of the Arena Football League.\nEdmonton Eskimos.\nWilliams was signed by the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League on June 23, 2013, but was later released that same day. On August 14 he was signed off of the team's practice roster and onto the Eskimos' active roster.\nCleveland Gladiators.\nOn October 24, 2014, Williams was assigned to the Cleveland Gladiators. He was placed on reassignment on March 30, 2015."

The World Cup is the premier competitive international football tournament, first played in 1930, and then every four years since, except 1942 and 1946, due to World War II.\nMexico has competed in the tournament since the inaugural 1930 World Cup, and has entered ever since, for a total of 16 tournaments, although it has failed to qualify for the finals proper on 3 occasions: 1934 (Italy), 1974 (West Germany), and 1982 (Spain). In addition, it withdrew from the finals in 1938 (France), and was banned by FIFA from entering the 1990 World Cup (Italy) after fielding over-aged players during the 1988 Olympic Games qualifiers, which was a youth tournament.\nThe tournament consists of two parts, the qualification phase and the final phase (officially called the \"World Cup Finals\"). The qualification phase, which currently take place over the three years preceding the Finals, is used to determine which teams qualify for the Finals. The current format of the Finals involves 32 teams competing for the title, at venues within the host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. The World Cup Finals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the 2006 tournament final."

After \"Marcus Wilson put on an absolute show in the first half\", scoring 18 points in the first 8 minutes, the Aces eventually fell to the Jayhawks, however this game brought him to the attention of NBA and professional teams that would give him the catapult needed to play professionally. \nWilsons career free throw percentage while playing in college was 88.7%, placing him 9th in that category in the history of college basketball. He was inducted into the University of Evansville Hall of Fame in 2007 \nWilson had his #5 University of Evansville jersey retired in 2018 at the Ford Center in Evansville, Indiana.\nProfessional basketball and coaching.\nAfter being named Missouri Valley Conference Player Of the Year, Wilson had and 11-year professional career that began in 1999 with the Utah Jazz in the Rocky Mountain Review Summer League.

        "title": "2011 FIFA Women's World Cup final",
        "text": "The 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup final was an association football match that took place on 17 July 2011 at Commerzbank-Arena, in Frankfurt, Germany, to determine the winner of 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. It was played between Japan and the United States. Japan won 3–1 in a penalty shoot-out following a 2–2 draw after extra time, becoming the first Asian team to win a senior—either men's or women's—World Cup final. Japan's victory was a major upset, made even more meaningful for the country as Japan was still feeling the effects of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that killed more than 15,000 people prior to the tournament.\nThe 2011 final was the last major sporting event to be broadcast in Japan prior to the country's digital switchover that took place on 24 July 2011.\nBackground.\nThe match was between the United States, which had been a major power in women's association football since winning the inaugural World Cup championship, and Japan, which had never won a major world title, or indeed even reached the finals of a major world competition. This was also the first appearances of the United States in the final after 12 years. The United States was bidding to become the first team to win a third world championship, having won in 1991 and 1999. Japan was bidding to become the fourth team to win a world championship, joining the United States, Norway and Germany. Interestingly, before the beginning of the competition, the Japanese side had almost pulled out from the competition due to the disastrous earthquake that happened back in their home country, as the women's league in Japan was suspended and eventually cancelled.\nThe match was the third between the two teams in World Cup play. The United States beat Japan 3–0 in pool play in 1991, and won 4–0 in a 1995 quarterfinal match. Going into the final, the United States had never lost to Japan, with 22 wins and 3 draws. Prior to the World Cup, the United States was the top-ranked team in the FIFA Women's World Rankings, while Japan was ranked fourth. Despite being ranked fourth, very few people expected Japan to reach the semi-finals, let alone win the tournament.\nThis marked the first time that a team won the World Cup having lost a match in pool play.\nJapan became only the second Asian national team to reach the FIFA Women's World Cup Final, following China's final appearance against the United States in 1999. This was also only the second final not involving a European team.\nRoute to the final.\nDespite being ranked 1st in the world by FIFA, the United States was the final team to qualify for the 2011 World Cup. After finishing third in the 2010 CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup, which serves as the CONCACAF qualifier, the United States was forced to defeat Italy in a Home and Away playoff. Japan, ranked 4th, qualified for the tournament by finishing third in the 2010 AFC Women's Asian Cup, which served as the AFC qualifier.\nOnce at the finals, the United States reached the knockout stage by finishing second in Group C behind Sweden, the only team they lost to in group play. They advanced through the quarterfinals on a penalty shootout with Brazil, in which the United States footballer Abby Wambach scored an equalizer in the 122nd minute of the game – in stoppage time, the latest goal ever scored in Women's World Cup play, – to tie the game 2–2 and bring the game into a penalty shootout. The United States then defeated France 3–1 to reach the final.\nJapan reached the knockout stage by finishing second in Group B behind England, which was the only team to defeat Japan in group play. Japan then stunned the host nation, two-time defending champions Germany, 1–0 in extra time. They then defeated Sweden 3–1 to reach the final match.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe Americans, the pre-game favorites to win, began strongly and pressured the Japanese for the first 20 minutes. However neither Carli Lloyd, Megan Rapinoe nor Abby Wambach managed to score to take an early lead. In 22', Shinobu Ohno gave Japan its first strike, but to no avail. In 28', Wambach's had a strike hit the bar. The Japanese had a chance in 30' but Ohno's breakthrough was denied by Hope Solo. The Americans resumed pressure and in 44', Christie Rampone almost cleared the Japanese line but was blocked; the Japanese launched an unsuccessful counterattack, ending the first half goalless. Japan had higher possession than the U.S. despite being mostly on the defensive.\nThe second half also began with American domination. Alex Morgan had a golden chance in 49', as Heather O'Reilly drove a low cross towards the near post which Morgan shot towards the net, beating Japanese keeper Ayumi Kaihori but was denied by the post. Kozue Ando and Ohno made the American defenders hustle from 54' to 56' before Aya Sameshima's corner kick was cleared. In 60', the Japanese almost got a chance to score when Yukari Kinga thrashed Sawa's excellent lofted through pass over the bar. In 69', Alex Morgan reacted first to a deep ball from Rapinoe, held off a challenge from Kumagai before drilling a low left-footed shot past Kaihori to give the U.S. a major breakthrough, giving the U.S. a 1–0 lead. The Japanese side regrouped and attacked the U.S., but Rampone's good defending management proved hard to break. However, in 81', as the U.S. attempted to counterattack, they were caught off guard by quick Japanese response, and while Ali Krieger have cleared the first chance, a mis-touch by Rachel Buehler provided Aya Miyama a golden chance, and she didn't miss it to level 1–1 for Japan. The U.S. attacked hard for the remaining time, but there was no goal to come as the two sides settled 1–1 after 90 minutes.\nExtra-time began with Japan enjoying better possession as usual, though they still maintained a defensive approach to fight against strong American attacks. In 104', when it appeared that they would end the first half of extra-time with no goal, Wambach's powerful header from the centre of the area off of Morgan's excellent pass gave the U.S. a 2–1 lead. With the second half of extra-time started, the Japanese looked exhausted and the U.S. appeared to have an advantage. However, mistakes by American defenders allowed Miyama and Homare Sawa to make direct threats, though there was no goal. But in 117', Japan received a corner kick; Miyama sent a low ball to Sawa, who ran towards the near post, made the corner before any U.S. defender and poked the ball over Solo to level it again. The result was kept til the end of extra-time even after Azusa Iwashimizu received a red card, sending the game to a penalty shoot-out.\nFor the United States, Shannon Boxx, Lloyd, and Tobin Heath missed three straight kicks, while only Yūki Nagasato missed the net out of Japan's first three attempts. Wambach tried to salvage it with a goal, but it went in vain when Saki Kumagai scored the decisive penalty to give Japan the World Cup trophy for the first time. They dedicated the trophy as a gift for the Japanese people at home who had suffered a devastating earthquake earlier that year in March.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\nReaction and impact.\nThe outcome of the game was so unbelievable that it caused widespread celebration in Japan as the country had just suffered the devastating March earthquake that demoralized the country. The Japanese side received international acclaim for becoming world champions from the background of a catastrophic natural disaster and poor conditions prior to the tournament, as well as referring to Japan's journey as a \"fairytale\", noting how the Japanese side came off a natural disaster crisis, lacked any sufficient support from the JFA as women's football wasn't the top priority of Japan's football development and had almost pulled out from the tournament owing to the disaster at home. Miho Kajioka, a football fan from Tokyo summed it up \"We haven't had a single piece of good news for the past four months. It's as if we had nothing to be hopeful about, so in that sense the result is great. It's incredible.\"\nTony DiCicco, manager of the victorious American side in the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup and a commentator in ESPN at the time, expressed the shocking outcome, “They feel they can win. That's almost never been the case before.” Aya Sameshima, who was part of the Japanese side in 2011, expressed that determination was the reason for Japan to overcome the adverse situations.\nFollowing the end of the game, the Japanese raised \"thank you\" banner to thank for international support to Japan in the difficult time, and was applauded by the majority of fans."

The remaining tickets went to the Tournament of Roses members, sponsors, City of Pasadena residents, and the general public. On September 8, 2011, Executive Director P. Scott McKibben resigned for personal reasons. William B. Flinn, the Tournament’s longstanding chief operating officer, assumed the role of interim executive director.\nPre-game activities.\nThe game was presided over by the 2012 Royal Court and the Grand Marshal, J.R. Martinez. Members of the Royal Court are Queen Drew Helen Washington, Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy; Sarah Nicole Zuno, Benjamin Franklin High School; Cynthia Megan Louie, La Salle High School; Morgan Eliza Devaud, La Canada High School; Kimberly Victoria Ostiller, Flintridge Preparatory School; Hanan Bulto Worku, Pasadena High School, and Stephanie Grace Hynes, Maranatha High School.\nAfter the teams' arrival in Southern California, the teams participated in the traditional Lawry's Beef Bowl in Beverly Hills and the Disney Media Day at Disneyland in nearby Anaheim. The Rose Bowl Hall of Fame ceremony luncheon was held on December 31, 2011 at the Pasadena Convention Center. The inductees were Ron Dayne, MVP of the 1999 and 2000 games from the University of Wisconsin; Dick Enberg, former NBC broadcaster; and George Fleming, the 1960 co-MVP (with Bob Schloredt, who was inducted in 1991) from the University of Washington.\nThe bands and cheerleaders from both schools participated in the early morning Rose Parade on Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena, California along with the floats, featuring stars and giant helmets, from the two conferences.\nTeams.\nTeams playing in the Rose Bowl game were the winners of the Pac-12 and Big Ten conference championship games, unless one team (or both teams) play in the BCS National Championship game. The teams were officially selected by the football committee of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association on Selection Sunday on December 4, 2011.\nThe Oregon Ducks, winners of the Pac-12 Championship game, represented the Pac-12 Conference, while the Wisconsin Badgers represented the Big Ten after winning the Big Ten Championship Game. Entering the game, the Badgers led the series 3–1 over the Ducks, winning in 1977, 1978 and 2000. In 2001, Oregon, coached by Chip Kelly defeated Wisconsin 31–28 at Autzen Stadium in Eugene Oregon. Both teams had their pre-game practices at the Home Depot Center in Carson, California.\nOregon.\nThe Ducks were led by LaMichael James in scoring with 19 touchdowns and 114 points in 11 games. Oregon was ranked 3rd in the nation in points scored (46.2 points per game) and 5th in rushing yards (295.7). Coming into the game, Oregon had held opponents to 23.6 points per game and allowed 243.5 yards in pass defense and 137.5 yards per game in rush defense. Combining the rushing yardage with the passing offense of 219.5 yards per game, the Ducks had a total offense of 515.2 yards per game.\nWisconsin.\nWisconsin, winning 11 games and losing 2 during the season, had the best offense in the Big Ten, scoring 80 touchdowns, 7 field goals for a total of 580 points. Wisconsin was ranked 4th in the nation in scoring (44.6 points per game) and 10th in rushing yards (237.4). The Badgers had limited opponents to just 17 points per game, 155 yards in passing and 138 yards in rushing. The team had passed for 229.5 yards per game for a total offense of 466.9 yards in total offense. Russell Wilson broke the FBS record for overall passer rating in a season."

The participating teams were Filipino Cup champion YCO Shine Masters, Magnolia Juice Drinks, RFM-Swifts, Lhuillier-Converse, Purefoods, Sta.Lucia Realty, Philips Sardines and newcomer Lady's Choice. The format is a one-round eliminations among eight teams with the top four making it to the semifinals at the end of preliminary round. YCO took the first semifinals berth with a 5-2 won-loss record, five other teams ended up with a 4-3 card. Purefoods, Philips and Swift Hotdogs made it to the next round by way of superior quotient over Magnolia and Lhuillier-Converse.\nThree foreign clubs were guest teams seeded into the semifinal round, they are the Hyundai Motors of South Korea, led by hotshot Lee Chung Hee, Golden Dragon of Taiwan and the Pacific All-stars, a tall team featuring top American servicemen in the Asia-Pacific region. Local teams beef up their roster by adding reinforcements from the ousted squads. RFM-Swifts and YCO arranged a best-of-three championship showdown by topping the semifinal round with identical 5-1 won-loss slates, Philips Sardines (4-2) and Golden Dragon of Taiwan (3-3 in a tie with Hyundai) dispute third place honors, Purefoods was 1-5 and winless Clark (Pacific) All-stars at 0-6.\nRFM-Swifts under coach Yeng Guiao, who called the shots for the hotdogs only for this tournament, won their first PABL title with a two-game sweep off YCO Shine Masters. Golden Dragon of Taiwan won third place via higher point difference following a victory over Philips that tied their series at one game apiece. Jojo Lastimosa of Lhuillier-Converse, who was a guest player of Swifts in the semifinals, won the Most Outstanding Local Player Award. Also cited as Most Outstanding Foreign Player was Korean Lee Chung Hee of Hyundai, he scored a tournament-high of 66 points in Hyundai's 110-111 loss to Philips Sardines on March 23.\nFreedom Cup.\nThe Second Conference called Freedom Cup started on May 16 at the ULTRA. Cebu-based Mama's Love and the newly formed MIESCOR Builders from Manila Electric Company, a power in major basketball in the early 1970s before Martial Law, joined the eight other ballclubs, raising the participating teams to 10. After the one-round eliminations, RFM-Swifts with new coach Chito Afable, were on top of the team standings with seven wins and two losses, followed by Magnolia Juice Drinks (6-3), national senior's champion Lhuillier-Converse, MIESCOR and YCO were all tied with five wins and four losses. Sta.Lucia and Purefoods dispute the last quarterfinals seat, the Realtors prevail over the Food Masters, 93-89 on June 8.\nThe six-team quarterfinal round had their carry-over records minus the results of their games against the other four teams eliminated. RFM-Swifts will have a 4-1 card, MIESCOR with three wins and two losses, Magnolia, Lhuillier, YCO and Sta. Lucia with two wins and three losses. Swifts and MIESCOR, both with six wins and four losses, makes it to the four-team semifinal round, along with YCO (tied with Magnolia and Sta. Lucia at 5-5 but made it via quotient system), Lhuillier-Converse were eliminated at 3-7. The Juice Drink Makers completed the cast with a 92-83 win over the Realtors in their playoff on June 24.\nIn the two-round semifinals, RFM-Swifts and YCO finish with identical 4-2 won-loss slates and will have a repeat title-clash. Magnolia (3-3) and MIESCOR (1-5) will play for third place. The YCO Shine Masters exact revenge over RFM-Swifts, which had no outside help this time, via 3-0 sweep in their best-of-five finals series. Magnolia won third place despite losing the third game against the Builders as they led their own series, two games to one.\nPhilippine Cup.\nA special tournament called Philippine Cup was held from August 3 to 10, featuring the Philippine men's national team, coach by Joe Lipa and sponsored by Philips Sardines, a PABL selection carrying the brand Rebisco, the US NCAA Selection sponsored by Swifts, Shanghai from China and a team from Egypt.\nThe US NCAA all-stars and the PABL-Philips played in the best-of-three finals following the nationals' 95-83 win over the Americans. Swift's-USA, PABL-Philips and Egypt ended the round with similar 3-1 slates but the Filipinos took the second finals slot over the Egyptians via a better FIBA goal average. Swift's-USA won the Philippine Cup title with a 2-1 series victory over PABL-Philips. After losing Game One in a fight-marred game, the Americans won the next two games by a big margin over the RP nationals.\nMaharlika Cup.\nFollowing the disbandment of YCO Shine Masters and Lady's Choice and with Mama's Love not taking part of the league's last offering of the season, seven teams were left to play in the Maharlika Cup which opens on October 10. After the two-round eliminations, the team standings were Lhuillier-Converse (9-3), Swift Hotdogs (8-4), Magnolia Ice Cream (7-5), Philips (6-6), Sta.Lucia and Purefoods (5-7), and MIESCOR (2-10).\nThe last four lower-seeded teams played in a two-round quarterfinals to determine three other semifinalists. Sta.Lucia finish with five wins and one loss, followed by MIESCOR with three wins and three losses, Philips and Purefoods, both with two wins and four losses, played in a sudden-death playoff on November 28, Philips won the match, 85-79.\nMagnolia and Swift advances into the championship with a 4-1 won-loss record in the one-round semifinals. The rest of the standings were Lhuillier-Converse (3-2), Philips Sardines (2-3), Sta.Lucia and MIESCOR (1-4). Magnolia Ice Cream won their second league title with a 3-1 series win over RFM-Swift Hotdogs, which had new acquisitions Alvin Patrimonio and Glenn Capacio from the disbanded YCO ballclub. Lhuillier-Converse placed third with a similar 3-1 win over Philips Sardines in their own series.\nOccurrences.\nGame One of the Philippine Cup Finals between the USA Selection (Swift) and the RP Men's National team (PABL-Philips) were triggered by a melee that spilled all over the court with only 30 seconds left in the ballgame, the nationals on top, 83-81, both benches emptied in a five-minute player fight with spectators joining the free-for-all. USA coach Jerry Webber call for a walkout and the nationals were awarded the win by forfeiture.\nGame four of the Maharlika Cup finals between Magnolia and Swift was halted for 15 minutes and with only 1:52 left in the ballgame. The Hotdogs walkout because they felt short-changed by the game officials, irate fans pelted the hardcourt with debris and softdrink bottles, it took a while before Swift coach Arturo Valenzona and his boys were persuaded to finish the game."

        "title": "3D Baseball",
        "text": "3D Baseball is a sports game developed and published by Crystal Dynamics and distributed by Mindscape. It was released in December 1996 for PlayStation and Sega Saturn. It features CNN sportscaster Van Earl Wright as the announcer.\nGameplay.\nThere are over 700 major league players included with their own statistics and batting stances (50 of which are included).\nIn the season mode, which is a full season of baseball, players can play it with an arcade setting or can be the general manager of the chosen team. Being the general manager means players will have to actually run the team. Players have to pick line-ups and the pitching rotation, substitute batters and runners, trade players, etc. This also allows players to build their very own dream team featuring their favorite players. Players can play a short or extended season or opt to play a quickie arcade game against the computer or friend.\nDevelopment.\nThe player animations were created using a new animation process called Real Motion Control, which involved motion capture. Game designer Sam Player explained the concept behind this process: \"The reason everything always ends up looking choppy in [most motion capture] games is that the machines can't store all the frames necessary for the full animation, and they end up showing every fifth frame or so. What we do is build polygonal models, break each model up into joints, and then follow the curve of each joint in motion. Then we save those curves instead of each individual frame of animation.\"\nReception.\nThe game received mixed reviews from critics. Reviews for the Saturn version typically commented that the game's smooth polygonal models and motion capture methodology combined to make the most realistic-looking baseball players in a video game to date, but that the gameplay, though as good or better than most baseball games, falls short of the leading competitors of the time, \"World Series Baseball II\" and \"Triple Play 97\". \"GamePro\" particularly mentioned some frustrations with the fielding controls.\nReviewing the PlayStation version, Hugh Sterbakov of \"GameSpot\" praised the realism and the voice of Van Earl Wright, but criticized the absences of Major League Baseball teams or logos, that players can only take the field in four \"imaginary\" ballparks, and that it lacks all-star, home run derby, and playoff modes. \"GamePro\" panned the game, remarking that \"although the graphics rank among the best of any baseball game, the gameplay's among the worst.\" They elaborated that the camera's practice of zooming in on the fielder makes it hard to know what is going on, and the physics are highly inaccurate. \"Game Revolution\" praised the game's \"outstanding\" 3D graphics, real stances and swings, \"excellent\" sound effects and commentary, competitive gameplay, and real teams that can be updated through trades."

        "text": "Imran Khan, a retired Pakistani cricketer and former Prime Minister of Pakistan, took 24 five-wicket hauls during his career in international cricket. In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five–for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and as of 2014 fewer than 45 bowlers have taken more than 15 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers. A right-arm fast bowler who represented his country between 1971 and 1992, Khan was described by the BBC as \"one of the finest fast bowlers cricket has ever seen\", while ESPNcricinfo declared him as \"the greatest cricketer to emerge from Pakistan, and arguably the world's second-best allrounder after Garry Sobers\". In 1983 he was named as one of the five Cricketers of the Year by the \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", and was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in January 2009.\nKhan made his Test debut in 1971 against England at Edgbaston Cricket Ground. His first Test five-wicket haul came in 1977 against Australia in a match at Melbourne Cricket Ground which Pakistan lost. In the same year, he took his first pair of five-wicket hauls in a single match against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground. By the end of his career, he had claimed five-wickets hauls in both innings of a match on three occasions. His career-best figures for an innings were 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka at Gaddafi Stadium, in March 1982. He took ten or more wickets in a match on six occasions.\nHaving made his One Day International (ODI) debut in August 1974 against England at Trent Bridge, Nottingham, Khan's solitary ODI five-wicket haul came in 1985 against India in a match at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium which Pakistan lost. He took 6 wickets for 14 runs in the match, which was his career-best bowling in ODI cricket. By the time he retired from international cricket in 1992 after nearly 21 years, Khan had taken 23 five-wicket hauls in Test cricket and one in ODIs. , he is fifteenth overall among all-time combined five-wicket haul takers, a position which he shares with Sydney Barnes, Kapil Dev and Dennis Lillee."

        "title": "UAAP Season 74 basketball tournaments",
        "text": "The University Athletic Association of the Philippines Season 74 basketball tournaments are the basketball events of UAAP's 2011-12 season. Ateneo de Manila University was the season host. The season started with an Olympic-style opening ceremony on July 9, 2011 and followed by a doubleheader basketball games on July 10 at the Araneta Coliseum.\nThe UAAP named former Philippine Basketball League (PBL) commissioner, current Rain or Shine Elasto Painters team consultant and Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) TV commentator Andy Jao as commissioner for basketball. Jao is considering on recommending to the UAAP board on hiring referees from the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP).\nThe game schedules were changed. Instead of the usual 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. schedules, game time were moved to 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. so that students can go home earlier and that basketball fans can also get to watch the PBA games which usually start at 5:30 p.m.\nThe eligibility of two players, Ray Parks and Greg Slaughter, were scrutinized by the UAAP Eligibility Committee. Parks of NU studied high school in the United States of America while Slaughter of Ateneo played with the Smart Gilas national team in the 2011 PBA Commissioner's Cup while serving residency.\nAt the eligibility meeting, Parks' and Slaughter's eligibilities were questioned. Parks had already undergone a one-year residency but the committee says that he has to do a two-year residency as he studied abroad. Ateneo's Ricky Palou, also UAAP President, said that Slaughter's appearance with Smart Gilas was not an issue.\nSlaughter's eligibility was cleared by the Eligibility Committee, pending approval by the UAAP Board. Meanwhile, Parks did not get a recommendation as additional documents were required by the Eligibility Committee.\nNU officials issued a statement that Parks has met all eligibility requirements and should be allowed play. NU athletic director Junel Baculi mentioned exceptions to the two-year redshirt rule when a player's parents were assigned abroad due to the nature of their jobs and children whose parents are overseas Filipino workers. Parks, who was born in the Philippines and studied in a local school up to seventh grade, went abroad when his mother took a job in the US where he studied at St. George's up to the 11th grade. He returned to the Philippines with his father in the late 2000s recession.\nThe UAAP Board eventually cleared both Parks and Slaughter, the former after having presented additional documents.\nAnother decision the Board had to make was which group of referees would be selected to officiate the games. The Basketball Referees Association for Schools, Colleges and Universities (BRASCU) and the referees from the SBP were the two organizations that were being chosen by the UAAP board.\nFinal Four Recap.\nThe Ateneo Blue Eagles finished on top of the elimination round standings although they were denied a 14–0 sweep by the Adamson Falcons, which clinched the #2 seed. The FEU Tamaraws faced the Falcons in the semifinals, in a series that went into two games. The Tamaraws were on their way of eliminating Adamson but the Falcons managed to cut FEU's double-digit lead but the Tamaraws held on to win. The Eagles met the UST Growling Tigers in the other semifinal series, with the Tigers reducing Ateneo's double-digit lead to a single basket but were denied in their last possession. In a rematch of the 2010 Finals where Ateneo won, the Eagles swept the Finals series 2–0 against the Tamaraws, with Nico Salva being named the Finals MVP. Ateneo won its fourth consecutive championship in Men's Basketball.\nIn the Juniors' tournament, the FEU-FERN Baby Tamaraws clinched the #1 seed after winning 12 consecutive games; their only loss against Ateneo at their second game. The Baby Tamaraws faced the Blue Eaglets in the semifinals, where Ateneo forced a deciding game; FEU-FERN won on the second game to advance to the Finals. The De La Salle Zobel Junior Archers, which won their first eight games, lost to FEU, NU and Ateneo in the second round to finish second. They met the NU Bullpups in the semifinals, which won in the first game. The Bullpups hanged on for a three-point win to clinch a Finals berth. The Baby Tamaraws won Game 1 in overtime, but the Bullpups won their school's first juniors' basketball title since 1974 by winning the last two games. Ralph Atangan was named the Finals MVP.\nLast season's runner-up FEU Lady Tamaraws finished first after the elimination round and faced the De La Salle Lady Archers in the semifinals. DLSU forced a rubber match with a three-point win but FEU scored a 22-point blowout in the second game to advance to the Finals. The UST Tigresses, which had won all first round games, were tied by Adamson and DLSU at the end of the eliminations. With DLSU emerging as the team with lowest quotient, UST and Adamson played off for the #2 seed, a game where the Lady Falcons won convincingly. The Lady Falcons had another convincing win against the Tigresses in the semifinals to arrange a Finals rematch against FEU. The Lady Falcons took Game 1 with a 4-point win, but FEU won Game 2 with a 22-point margin; FEU won the deciding game via an 11-point victory.

        "title": "W.A.K.O. European Championships 2008 (Varna)",
        "text": "W.A.K.O. European Championships 2008 in Varna were the joint twenty European kickboxing championships held by the W.A.K.O. organization arranged by the Bulgarian kickboxing chief Boyan Kolev, with the second event to be held the next month in Oporto, Portugal. It was the second W.A.K.O. event to be held in Varna and Bulgaria (the last was in 1992) and involved around 500 amateur men and women from 35 countries across Europe.\nThere were four styles on offer at Varna: Full-Contact and Semi-Contact kickboxing, Musical Forms and Aero-Kickboxing. Only one competitor per weight division were allowed to participate in the Full and Semi-Contact divisions and this also applied for Aero-Kickboxing (which had no weight divisions), while Musical Forms was allowed two maximum per country. The other styles (Low-Kick, K-1, Light-Contact) would be available at the later event in Portugal. The top nation by the end of the championships was Hungary, with regular leaders Russia in second and Ukraine in third. The event was held over four days at the Palace of Culture and Sports in Varna, Bulgaria, starting on Wednesday, 22 October and ending on Saturday, 25 October 2008.\nFull-Contact.\nFull-Contact is a style of kickboxing where punches and kicks are allowed to be thrown by the participants at full force, with strikes below the waist prohibited. Most fights result in a judge’s decision or stoppage victory and as with most other forms of amateur kickboxing, head and various body protection must be worn. More information on Full-Contact and the rules can be found at the official W.A.K.O. website. The men had twelve weight divisions in Varga ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs while the women had seven ranging from 48 kg/105.6 lbs to over 70 kg/+143 lbs. Unlike previous W.A.K.O. championships there was not an influx of talent at the Varga event with only several repeat winners such as Alexey Tokarev, having won gold at the world championships in Coimbra the previous year, and Serhiy Cherkaskyy and Hamza Kendircioğlu, having won gold medals at the Europeans in Lisbon two years before. Russia were the strongest nation in the style, pipping neighbours Ukraine into first place by virtue of having won five golds, two silvers and two bronze.\nSemi-Contact.\nSemi-Contact is the least physical of the contact kickboxing styles available at W.A.K.O. events. It involves the participants throwing controlled strikes at targets above the waist, with point's scored on the basis of speed and technique with power prohibited. Despite the less physical nature all contestants must wear head and various body protection - more detail on the Semi-Contact and the rules can be found on the official W.A.K.O. website. At Vargas the men had nine weight divisions ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 94 kg/+206.8 lbs while the women had six, ranging from 50 kg/110 lbs to over 70 kg/154 lbs and there was also a mixed team event.\nAlthough not full of recognisable faces there were several winners from recent world and European championships with Zsolt Moradi and Zsofia Minda picking up their third gold medals in a row at W.A.K.O. championships, while Andrea Lucchese, Marco Culiersi, Anna Kondar and Gloria De Bei had also won at the last world championships. By the end of the championships, Hungary were easily the most dominant nation in the style, winning ten gold, two silver and two bronze, which also included winning the team event as well.\nMusical Forms.\nMusical Forms is a type of non-physical competition which sees the contestants fighting against imaginary foes using Martial Arts techniques - more information on the style can be found on the W.A.K.O. website. Unlike Full and Semi-Contact kickboxing there were no weight divisions, only male and female competitions and competitors were allowed to compete in more than one category with some countries having than one athlete in each category. The men and women at Varga competed in four different styles explained below:\nThere were a few familiar winners in Musical Forms at Varga, with regular gold medallists Andrey Bosak and Maria Pekarchyk winning two events each and Veronika Dombrovskaya winning one. By the end of the championships Russia were the top nation in Musical Forms winning four gold, six silver and one bronze.\nAero-Kickboxing.\nAero-Kickboxing is a non-physical competition, involving participants using a mixture of aerobic and kickboxing techniques in time to specifically selected music. There are no weight divisions as with other forms of kickboxing in W.A.K.O. but there are separate male, female and team categories, with or without an aerobic step. As with Musical Forms, competitors were allowed to compete in more than one category and some countries had more than one athlete in each category. More information on Aero-Kickboxing and the rules can be found on the W.A.K.O. website. Although a lower prestige sport compared to other events, Mikhail Gerasimov stood out amongst the winners by taking gold in both men's events. The top nation in Aero-Kickboxing was Hungary who claimed four golds, one silver and one bronze, which included winning both of the team events."

        "title": "Tennis (band)",
        "text": " \nTennis is an American indie pop band from Denver, Colorado, United States, made up of husband-and-wife duo Alaina Moore and Patrick Riley. The duo formed in 2010, and released their debut album, \"Cape Dory\", in 2011. Their second album, \"Young &amp; Old\", was released the following year. Their third album, \"Ritual in Repeat\" (2014), was released on Communion records. \nThe band's fourth album, \"Yours Conditionally\", was released in 2017, followed by \"Swimmer\" in 2020. \"Swimmer\" was named one of the best albums of 2020 by \"USA Today\". Their sixth studio album, \"Pollen\", was released on February 10, 2023.\nBackground.\nAlaina Moore (born May 9, 1985) and Patrick Riley (born September 9, 1986) met in a philosophy class while both were students at the University of Colorado, Denver in 2008. The couple started the band after they returned from an eight-month sailing expedition down the Eastern Atlantic Seaboard after their graduation. Moore had initially intended to go to law school. The songs on the band's first album would come to document their experiences sailing. Prior to forming Tennis, Moore's earliest singing experience was in church choirs during her youth.\nCareer.\n2010–2013: \"Cape Dory\" and \"Young &amp; Old\".\nTheir first releases, both in July 2010, were the \"Baltimore\" EP on the Underwater Peoples label and the \"South Carolina\" single on Fire Talk. Tennis released their first studio album, \"Cape Dory\" on Fat Possum Records in January 2011. The album, featured on NPR, was based on the couple's experiences during their sailing trip.\nDuring their first tour, James Barone joined the band on drums.\nThe second Tennis album, \"Young &amp; Old\", was released on Fat Possum Records on February 14, 2012, produced by Patrick Carney of The Black Keys, preceded by the single \"Origins\", which was issued on Forest Family Records on December 6, 2011.\nTennis released a number of covers as self-released (digital) singles during 2011-2012, including versions of \"Tell Her No\" by the Zombies, \"Is It True?\" by Brenda Lee, \"Tears in the Typing Pool\" by Broadcast and \"Guiding Light\" by Television.\n\"American Songwriter\" named Tennis their Writer of the Week for the week of April 23, 2012.\nThe band made several television appearances during 2012, performing \"Origins\" on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" on March 21, \"It All Feels the Same\" on \"Late Night with David Letterman\" on April 9, and \"My Better Self\" and \"High Road\" on \"Conan\" on July 25.\n2014–2015: \"Small Sound\" and \"Ritual in Repeat\".\nIn November 2013, Tennis released a 5-song EP titled \"Small Sound\" on Communion Records.

In May 2014, the band supported sister-act Haim on their North American spring tour.\nTheir third album, \"Ritual in Repeat\", was released on Communion in September 2014 to critical acclaim. In a feature on the album, NPR \"Fresh Air\"'s Terry Gross said, \"Can you re-invent lively pop from the distant past? ...songwriting team Tennis does just that with their new third album, \"Ritual in Repeat\"\", while NPR's critic Milo Miles stated, \"On \"Ritual in Repeat\", it's like Moore and Riley discover just how much ancient Latin, or in this case extinct pop styles, is their natural language\". Barone left the group in 2015.\nOn March 29, 2015, Tennis performed at Burger Records' Burgerama 4 festival in Santa Ana, California, and two songs from that set, \"I'm Callin\" and \"Never Work for Free\", were later aired on the May 7 episode of \"Last Call with Carson Daly\".

        "text": "Spartan Cricket Club is a cricket club in Barbados.\nSpartan was formed in 1893 as a club for middle-class black and creole cricketers who were denied entry into all-white cricket clubs such as Wanderers and Pickwick. The inaugural president of the club was Sir William Conrad Reeves, Chief Justice of Barbados and other members consisted mostly of \"lawyers, medical practitioners, elite schoolmasters, higher level civil servants and the few non-whites to have penetrated the managerial levels of the business, commercial and plantation worlds.\" The club played its matches at the Belleville ground in Saint Michael and the first captain of the club was George Learmond.\nCricket in Barbados at the time was strictly divided by colour and class. Spartan was seen as a middle-class club and in its early years efforts to admit working-class cricketers met with some resistance. In 1899, the club was divided about the admission of Fitz Hinds—a talented cricketer who had previously worked as a groundsman at Pickwick Cricket Club. After his admission, many of his team-mates refused to play with him. The club was split again in 1913 when Herman Griffith attempted to join the club. Considered \"too poor to enter\", he was denied admission. This attitude distressed a significant minority of the club who split and established a club for working-class blacks, Empire Cricket Club in 1914. Spartan and Empire developed a strong rivalry.\nBefore and after Barbadian independence, members of Spartan Cricket Club were influential members of Barbadian society, including Grantley Adams, the first Premier of Barbados. It is claimed that Spartan has \"produced more [West Indies] Test cricketers than any other [club] in the Caribbean\". The club now plays its games at Queen's Park in Bridgetown.\nNotable cricketers from Spartan include:"

The headquarters is located in Çankaya district of Ankara. It is a member of the European Handball Federation (EHF).\nIt organizes leagues, tournaments and championships for all age groups of both genders at national level. In addition, support services like the education of referees and coaches are within its duties. Participations of Turkish handball teams at all international competition events are organized by the federation.\nHistory.\nHandball sport began in Turkey in the period 1927-1938 as an outdoor game, initiated by three Turkish instructors for physical education at military schools, who were trained in Germany. The first official rules for field handball were published in 1934 by the \"Turkey Physical Training Association\" (), and the first official open-air field handball match was played in 1938.\nIn 1942, the sports handball, volleyball and basketball were organized unter the \"Sport Games Federation\" () that led to a fast-growing development. The first field handball league was formed in the 1942-43 season in Istanbul. In 1945, the first Turkish championship was organized.\nFrom 1945 on, indoor handball matches were held for girls in schools. Between 1960 and 1962, the first referee courses took place. Serious efforts relating indoor handball date from the mid-1970s. In that time, instructors of physical education, who were sent to West Germany for further education, founded the modern indoor handball sport in Turkish schools following their return. In 1975, official indoor handball rules were translated and published by Yaşar Sevim of the Sports Academy of Ankara.\nOn February 4, 1976, Turkey Handball Federation was established. Yaşar Sevim was appointed its first president, who had received further education for four years at the Sports Academy in Cologne, Germany."

        "text": "The Munster Cricket Union is one of five provincial governing bodies for cricket in Ireland. Along with the Connacht, Northern, Leinster and North West unions, it makes up the Irish Cricket Union (now known as Cricket Ireland), the supreme governing body of Irish cricket.\nThe Munster jurisdiction historically covered the traditional Irish provinces of Munster and Connacht in the Republic of Ireland, but since 2010 Connacht has had a separate union. The Union was founded in 1956. In 2005, there were 21 clubs fielding 32 teams affiliated to the union. It organises the Munster Senior League and Munster Senior Cup. In 2005, for the first time, a small league of five teams was organised in Connacht.\nIn March 2018 Munster Cricket agreed a lucrative sponsorship deal with international cricket equipment retailer All Rounder Cricket. The financial support given will be invested in further development of cricket and specifically grassroots cricket within the Union.\nMunster Cricket is made up of a number of affiliated sports clubs throughout the province of Munster engaged in the playing of cricket. Its role is to promote, foster and organise the playing of cricket in the province. There are currently 41 affiliated clubs participating in senior and youth competitions as well as through a network of T20 and social cricket. The number of clubs is increasing with renewed interest in the sport in the fast growing areas around the hubs of Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Tralee.\nThe season runs from mid- April to mid- September with league and cup competitions organised for different groups. The main Adult Competitions are divided into three divisions, with each team also having the option to enter the Senior, Junior and Minor knockout cup competitions.\nBecause of the relative shortage of cricket grounds in Munster, many of the clubs field a number of teams, so you will find a match going on in most clubs every weekend and youth and social matches throughout the week.\nSchools matches are played mainly in the urban and suburban areas of Cork and Limerick during the short summer term from after Easter to the end of May. For the remainder of the summer the clubs organize teams for young players, boys and girls, from the Under-9 age group.\nThere is also a lot of social cricket between clubs, companies and loosely formed groups of enthusiastic cricketers. This provides opportunities not only for those that have retired from the more competitive leagues and cups but also for beginners who want to take up the sport for the first time or for those who perhaps have not played since school but want to get started again. It is a good way for people who have moved to the urban areas of Cork, Limerick, Tralee and Waterford to integrate and make friends. Some of the social clubs are very well organized and go on tour.\nThe MCU works closely with Cricket Ireland to continue to expand the gospel of cricket into new areas throughout the large catchment area that is Munster. The Union employs, with government support, a development officer who oversees the development of youth and schools cricket in the province. Munster Senior Cup and Division 1 winners also participate in the Irish Senior Cup while the remaining senior clubs compete in the National Cup."

His results have thus been removed here, with cyclists behind him moving up one spot.\nStage 1.\nThe Tour started with a road stage rather than the traditional prologue time trial, and with an uphill finish. The day started with a non-racing parade over the tidal Passage du Gois. When underway, the riders initially followed the coast, where the wind could have had an impact, before heading inland to Les Herbiers and the finish on the Mont des Alouettes.\nThe first breakaway of the Tour was formed by three riders: Lieuwe Westra of , Perrig Quéméneur of and Jérémy Roy of . They attacked from the very beginning of the race and their maximum advantage was over six minutes. The top places in the intermediate sprint after were won by the breakaway members and the new points distribution saw green jersey contenders competing for the rest of points. Tyler Farrar took fourth place ahead of André Greipel. About nine kilometres from the end, Maxim Iglinsky collided with a spectator, and the resulting crash held up the majority of the field, including Alberto Contador and Samuel Sánchez. This group were chasing the lead group of 78 riders, until within the last three kilometers, they were delayed by another crash that had split the lead group approximately in half. On the uphill finish, an attack by Fabian Cancellara was successfully countered by Philippe Gilbert, who was favourite for the stage, and who finished three seconds clear of Cadel Evans, who finished a similar margin clear of the chasing group. Due to rules that protect riders against time lost due to accidents in the latter stages of a race, about 40 riders who had been in the same group as Gilbert and others at to go, but who were delayed by a later crash, were awarded the same time as those who finished just behind Gilbert and Evans, but those who caught up with them, having been delayed in the Iglinsky incident, lost at least 1'20\".\nStage 2.\nThe team time trial was relatively short at and mostly flat, so large time gaps were not expected. , who saw all their GC contenders lose nearly two minutes on stage 1, won the stage to place their world champion Thor Hushovd in the overall lead, while Cadel Evans, who had a three-second advantage over Hushovd going into the stage, was almost able to take the yellow jersey, as his team took just four seconds longer than to come second, a fraction of a second faster than .\nStage 3.\nThe break of the day, consisting of Mickaël Delage (), José Iván Gutiérrez (), Rubén Pérez (), Maxime Bouet () and Niki Terpstra () went clear within the opening kilometre of racing. Their lead reached a maximum of eight minutes after . The members of the breakaway took the intermediate sprint, but the sprint for remaining points caused controversy, as Mark Cavendish, who won the sprint, later had the points he won at this stage removed, as did Thor Hushovd. Delage and Gutiérrez were the last pair of the break to remain clear of the peloton, but were caught with remaining. The stage was won by Hushovd's teammate Tyler Farrar, who took his first individual Tour stage win. Farrar formed a 'W' sign with his fingers on the line in homage to his friend Wouter Weylandt who died in a crash on the Giro d'Italia in May. rider José Joaquín Rojas, third on the stage, assumed the lead of the points classification from Philippe Gilbert.\nStage 4.\nThis was an undulating course, with a steep hill shortly before the finish. A five-man breakaway group escaped after , consisting of Jérémy Roy (), Blel Kadri (), Imanol Erviti (), Johnny Hoogerland () and Gorka Izagirre (), and remained on their own until the foot of the Mûr-de-Bretagne. Defending champion Alberto Contador was the first to attack in the closing stages, causing several splits in the field, including a group of ten at the front of the race. As Contador's initial attack failed, Jurgen Van den Broeck tried to break clear, but was caught up by the front group, and Cadel Evans, third in the overall standings at the beginning of the day, held off a final sprint from Contador to win the stage, but the presence of Thor Hushovd in the lead group meant that Hushovd kept the overall lead, while Evans took the lead in the mountains classification.\nStage 5.\nMany riders tried to get into the breakaway in this stage, but the final breakaway was formed of 4 riders: José Iván Gutiérrez (), Tristan Valentin (), Sébastien Turgot (), and Anthony Delaplace (). They had a maximum advantage of 5 minutes. The intermediate sprint was won by the breakaway riders, while in the peloton Borut Božič took the highest remaining points haul. José Joaquín Rojas and Tom Boonen were penalised for irregular sprinting at this point, a penalty that cost Rojas his lead in the green jersey competition. After the intermediate sprint, set a very high pace and there were many crashes in the peloton, one of which involved Janez Brajkovič, who had to abandon due to a broken collarbone and concussion. Another crash involved Nicki Sørensen who fall off when his bike was clipped by a photo motorcycle and it was dragged along by it for 200m. Alberto Contador, Robert Gesink, Tom Boonen, Sylvain Chavanel and Iván Velasco, who sustained a broken collarbone, were among other riders who crashed on this stage. The breakaway was caught with to go, but Thomas Voeckler () and Jérémy Roy () attacked with to go, creating a maximum gap of one minute, and the race was in the last before Voeckler was caught. A late attack by Edvald Boasson Hagen disrupted the lead out lines for the main sprinters, but Mark Cavendish nevertheless took the victory ahead of Philippe Gilbert in the last 50 metres. There were no changes among the leading riders and contenders for the General Classification, but Gilbert assumed the lead in the sprinters' competition, although this was confirmed only after Rojas had been presented with the leader's jersey on the podium.\nStage 6.\nThis was another undulating stage with a hill in the last few kilometres, expected to suit classics specialists. Lieuwe Westra () initiated the main break of the day, eventually joined by his teammate Johnny Hoogerland, Anthony Roux (), Leonardo Duque () and Adriano Malori (). Their lead reached 12 minutes, and Hoogerland added to the point in the mountains classification that he already had on the first two categorised climbs of the day, and thus ensured that he would take over the polka-dot jersey, and he, along with Roux and Duque, had ceased trying to stay clear when there were still some 60 km remaining, but Westra and Malori persisted, with Malori only caught with less than three km remaining. A late attack by Jelle Vanendert () and Thomas Voeckler () was caught with a kilometre remaining, and the sprint was eventually won by Edvald Boasson Hagen of (), with fellow Norwegian Thor Hushovd finishing third to retain the yellow jersey. Although there were several heavy rain showers, there were fewer falls than in the previous stage, although GC contender Levi Leipheimer () fell and lost more than a minute.\nStage 7.\nThis stage had no climbing points available, and was considered to be very much a chance for the sprint specialists to contest the stage win. The break formed very early in the stage, with two riders from , Gianni Meersman and Mickaël Delage along with Yannick Talabardon () and Pablo Urtasun (). A crash with remaining caused injuries to Bradley Wiggins of and Chris Horner of that caused them to retire from the race, while other GC contenders to lose time included Levi Leipheimer, Ryder Hesjedal, Roman Kreuziger, Rigoberto Urán and Bauke Mollema. The sprint train of dominated the closing stages of the races, allowing Mark Cavendish to take the stage win. Overall leader Thor Hushovd finished in seventh place to retain that position.\nStage 8.\nThis stage had the first category two climb of the race, and brought the race into the higher climbs of the Massif Central. By the ascent of the day's main climb, in the final 25 km, four riders from the original nine-man break remained clear: Rui Costa (), Christophe Riblon (), Tejay van Garderen () and Cyril Gautier (). On that climb, several riders attempted to attack from the group, of whom Juan Antonio Flecha () and Alexander Vinokourov () attained a considerable margin over the peloton as they pursued the leader. Vinokourov started the stage only 32 seconds behind overall leader Thor Hushovd, and this was thought to be a bid to take the yellow jersey. The final climb to the Super Besse ski station saw several attempts at breaks among the leaders, and eventually Costa was able to open a gap to the rest of the breakaway group. Vinokourov overhauled the rest of the escapees, but he was caught within the last kilometre, while Costa won the stage. Philippe Gilbert broke clear of the peloton to secure second place, and the lead in the points competition, while Hushovd, contrary to expectations, finished in the first group to retain his overall lead. Van Garderen, by virtue of having been the first rider over the category two Col de la Croix Saint-Robert, assumed the lead in the climbers' category.\nStage 9.\nThis stage, like the preceding one, had more points available for the king of the mountains competition than all the preceding stages added together. There were no breaks from the peloton until the first climb of the day, which was contested by Thomas Voeckler () and Johnny Hoogerland (), who were joined by Juan Antonio Flecha (), Sandy Casar (), Luis León Sánchez () and Niki Terpstra (). Terpstra was unable to stay with the escapees on higher climbs as the day went on, but the remaining five riders extended their lead. An early fall by Alberto Contador, after a collision with Vladimir Karpets, caused aggravation to an earlier knee injury, but a later fall delayed many riders, and caused the elimination of GC contenders Alexander Vinokourov and Jurgen Van den Broeck, and injury to Andreas Klöden and other riders. The pursuit of the breakaway was delayed to allow riders involved in the crash, or who stopped to help their colleagues, to rejoin the peloton, thus increasing the likelihood that Voeckler, less than a minute and a half behind in the general classification, would take over the race leadership. Within the final 40 km, two of the leading five riders were involved in a dramatic crash after Juan Antonio Flecha was sideswiped by a France Télévisions car during an overtaking manoeuvre, causing fellow breakaway rider, Johnny Hoogerland to crash into a barbed wire fence. His wound required 33 stitches. Although both riders were able to finish the stage and they shared the combative rider award for the day (one of the rare cases when it had been jointly awarded), they were unable to stay ahead of the peloton. The other three riders from the breakaway retained most of their lead, with little urgency among the peloton for reducing their winning margin, and Sánchez sprinted clear to take the stage. Voeckler assumed the overall lead and Hoogerland had gained enough points prior to his crash to regain leadership in the King of the Mountains competition, while Philippe Gilbert was again the first to finish from the main group, extending his lead in the points classification.\nStage 10.\nThe stage after the first rest day returned to lower altitudes, and had only third and fourth category climbs. A six-man breakaway group became established after 11 km, consisting of Rémy Di Gregorio (), Arthur Vichot (), Sébastien Minard (), Julien El Fares (), Marco Marcato () and Anthony Delaplace (), but never had more than three minutes advantage, and was finally caught by late breakaways, and eventually most of the field, on the ascent of the final climb, some 15 km from the finish. That late break was started by Philippe Gilbert, leader of the points competition, and overall leader Thomas Voeckler, and also had Tony Gallopin (), Dries Devenyns () and Tony Martin (). This break was unsuccessful, but prevented the usual sprinters' trains, and in the final kilometre, Mark Cavendish was following Daniel Oss () prior to his final effort. André Greipel (), who had been following Cavendish, was able to pass him in the final straight to win the stage, while Cavendish and third placed José Joaquín Rojas reduced Gilbert's lead in the points competition on a day that had no effect on the upper reaches of the general classification.\nStage 11.\nOn another stage that was expected to suit sprint specialists, the six members of the breakaway group (Rubén Pérez, Lars Boom, Andriy Hrivko, Mickaël Delage, Tristan Valentin and Jimmy Engoulvent were unable to gain an advantage of more than four and a half minutes. Amid heavy rain, the break was not caught until the final of the race, and Mark Cavendish took the bunch sprint for his third win of the race, and the resultant points, in combination with those he took by being the first non-breakaway rider at the intermediate sprint, allowed him to take the leadership in the green jersey competition. The stage had no impact on the overall placings."

        "text": "These are the profiles and summaries for the individual stages in the 2011 Tour de France, with Stage 12 on 14 July, and Stage 21 on 24 July.\nStage 12.\nThe first stage to enter the high mountains, the route included one first category (La Hourquette d'Ancizan, used by the tour for the first time), and two highest category climbs, and a summit finish. The early breakaway, consisting of Geraint Thomas (), Iván Gutiérrez (), Rubén Pérez (), Laurent Mangel (), Blel Kadri () and Jérémy Roy (), established a maximum lead of nine minutes and preserved their lead over the first two climbs. On the final climb, an attack by Jelle Vanendert () and Samuel Sánchez () was the first to overhaul the breakaway, and they were pursued by a group of the main GC contenders, initially with pacesetting by Sylwester Szmyd which reduced the size of the group, although contrary to expectations, yellow jersey wearer Thomas Voeckler remained with the leaders. With remaining, Fränk Schleck broke clear of the yellow jersey group, but was unable to catch Sánchez and Vanendert, who took the first two places. Within the final kilometre, Alberto Contador lost time to some of his main rivals for the overall competition, Ivan Basso, Cadel Evans and Andy Schleck.\nStage 13.\nFrom the original ten man breakaway, three riders, Jérémy Roy (), Thor Hushovd () and David Moncoutié (), went clear on the highest category ascent to the Col d'Aubisque, with Roy leading over the top by nearly a minute from Moncoutié, with Hushovd more than a minute further behind. Roy's lead over the peloton at that point was over 8 minutes, and he became leader of the King of the Mountain competition. On the descent, Hushovd caught Moncoutie and the pair pursued Roy until Hushovd, who had worn the yellow jersey for 7 stages earlier in the race, dropped Moncountie inside the last , and passed Roy to win the stage: Moncoutié eventually took second place. Most of the other riders from the early break stayed clear of the peloton, from which Philippe Gilbert (), accompanied by Bauke Mollema (), broke away on the descent to regain his place in the top ten overall and gain some points over the other contenders in the points competition. There was little other change in the general classification, with the main peloton coming in some seven and a half minutes behind Hushovd, but Andreas Klöden withdrew earlier in the stage having suffered injuries earlier in the race.\nStage 14.\nThis stage had six categorised climbs. From the original break, which had as many as 24 members but was disrupted by several breaks from among the group, Sandy Casar of had the virtual lead at one point, but by the beginning of the last climb, to the highest category finish at Plateau de Beille his lead was little over two minutes. On the steeper lower slopes of the climb the chase group was reduced to the eight leading men in the general classification, Voeckler's teammate Pierre Rolland, Rigoberto Urán, who took the white jersey for the leading young rider at the end of the stage, Jean-Christophe Péraud, and Jelle Vanendert. After three abortive attempts by Andy Schleck to split the group, Vanendert broke from the select group of favourites with some remaining, and was the first to overtake Casar, but only Damiano Cunego was unable to stay with the group. Ivan Basso put the group under further pressure, but Samuel Sánchez was the only one to make any meaningful pursuit of Vanendert, with those two riders reversing the finishing positions from stage 12. Andy Schleck gained two seconds over the group in the final few hundred metres, and Vanendert's stage victory also earned him the leadership of the mountains category.\nStage 15.\nOn the last largely flat stage before the final day of the race, the main breakaway group of the day had five members; and was established from the beginning of the stage. The group—Mickaël Delage (), Niki Terpstra (), Samuel Dumoulin (), Mikhail Ignatiev () and Anthony Delaplace ()—was never more than three minutes clear of the peloton and as the catch approached, Ignatiev and Terpstra moved clear of their colleagues. Terpstra was the last member of the group to be caught, with about remaining; despite some attempts at late breakaways including one by Philippe Gilbert, sprinters dominated the finish, with Mark Cavendish winning his fourth stage of the race ahead of Tyler Farrar and Alessandro Petacchi.\nStage 16.\nThe first stage to enter the Alps had a very high pace for the first two hours, with no break from the peloton until the second half of the stage. Ten riders eventually moved clear of the peloton, but extended their margin rapidly to six minutes. After an unsuccessful attempt to move ahead of the bunch by Mikhail Ignatiev (), Ryder Hesjedal () got clear to lead over the category 2 mountain. He was eventually caught by his teammate Thor Hushovd and another Norwegian, Edvald Boasson Hagen (), before Hushovd went on to win the stage, his second of the tour. On the ascent of the Col de Manse, Alberto Contador made two attacks, the second of which was successful, with Cadel Evans and Samuel Sánchez joining him in taking a time advantage on the stage over the other riders in contention for high placings in the general classification, and more than a minute over Andy Schleck.\nStage 17.\nThis stage had five categorised climbs, but as with the preceding stage, finished with a descent. More than had passed before any break was established, but a group of fourteen riders finally got clear and extended their lead to over eight minutes. From that group, Rubén Pérez () broke away to be first over the Col de Sestriere, but was caught by a counterattack on the final climb initiated by Sylvain Chavanel (), which also included Edvald Boasson Hagen (), Bauke Mollema () and Jonathan Hivert (). Boasson Hagen led over the final mountain and retained his lead on the descent to win the stage, while Hivert left the road twice and thus enabled Mollema to take second place. Among the General Classification contenders both Alberto Contador and Andy Schleck were aggressive on the last climb, but were unable to drop their opponents, while on the descent an attack initiated by yellow jersey wearer Thomas Voeckler, accompanied by Contador and Samuel Sánchez, was able to escape the group. Voeckler went off the road on two corners on the descent; and although Contador and Sánchez were able to stay clear for most of the descent, they were caught by a group that included all the other members of the top eight in the overall ranking—apart from Voeckler and Ivan Basso, who both conceded 27 seconds to their rivals.\nStage 18.\nThis stage had three highest category climbs, including both the highest point of the 2011 Tour and the highest finish in the history of the race. A group of 14 riders made a break after , and their lead reached nine minutes, but dropped to five and a half by the time Maxim Iglinsky () led over the Col Agnel. The lead group had been reduced to six by the top of the second climb, the Col d'Izoard, which Iglinski again passed first, but by this time the group of favourites for the overall race had been affected by a solo attack by Andy Schleck. He gained two minutes on the remaining part of that climb, and had assistance from Joost Posthuma and Maxime Monfort, members of his team who had been in the early break. The group of the remaining leading General Classification competitors seemed poorly co-ordinated, and with to go, Schleck had reached the head of the race with an advantage of 4:24 over the yellow jersey group. Cadel Evans was the pace setter for the group in pursuit of Schleck, and some of the leading challengers lost time to the pursuing group, including Alberto Contador and Samuel Sánchez. Andy Schleck's winning margin was reduced at the end of the stage to a little over two minutes, with his brother Fränk passing the remnants of the chase group to take second place. Thomas Voeckler retained the overall race lead, although his advantage was reduced to 15 seconds. More than half the field finished outside the cut-off time for elimination, but were reprieved and instead penalised by the loss of 20 points, which meant that José Joaquín Rojas moved to 15 points behind Mark Cavendish in the competition for the green jersey.\nStage 19.\nThis was the shortest stage of the tour, other than time trials, and featured three mountains. Although a 14-man break had moved ahead of the peloton within the first , the race was animated by a break by Alberto Contador after . He was joined in the break by yellow jersey wearer Thomas Voeckler, Andy Schleck and Cadel Evans, but another acceleration later left only Schleck able to stay with Contador. Evans soon afterwards had a mechanical issue with his bicycle, and waited for the peloton to catch him up, while Voeckler opted to try to follow Contador and Schleck alone. By the top of the first climb, the Col du Télégraphe, Contador and Schleck had passed most of the first breakaway group, and in passing the col second behind Gorka Izagirre, Schleck became virtual leader of the mountains classification on the last day that points were available in that competition.\nThe climb to the Col du Galibier saw the front group reduced to four men: Contador, Schleck, Rui Costa and Christophe Riblon; Samuel Sánchez counter-attacked to join the group on the descent, while Voeckler dropped to the pursuit group that included the other leading riders in the general classification. The advantage of the leaders over the chase group dropped from its maximum of nearly two minutes to 42 seconds by the top of the Galibier, by which time Voeckler had been dropped to a third group. The chase group caught up with the leaders by the bottom of the valley, and the larger group was also joined by the yellow jersey group before the beginning of the climb to Alpe d'Huez. Ryder Hesjedal and Pierre Rolland had attacked along the valley, and led by some 38 seconds at the beginning of the climb. Attacks at the foot of the climb by Jakob Fuglsang, and then by Evans and Bauke Mollema, were unable to escape the group, but Contador was again able to break clear. When he caught Rolland and Hesjedal, the Canadian immediately fell away, while Rolland was able to stay with Contador for some time. The following group gradually diminished in numbers, and Voeckler dropped back, eventually finishing in 20th place. Shortly after Contador moved clear into the lead on his own, with remaining, Peter Velits and Sánchez broke from the pursuit group. Sánchez caught up with Rolland, and the pair drew closer to Contador, while the two favourites for the general classification, Andy Schleck and Cadel Evans, rode in close proximity.\nSánchez and Rolland caught up with the rapidly tiring Contador with remaining, and Rolland immediately attacked and went on to win the stage and take the lead in the young riders' competition. The two Spaniards worked together for a while, before Sánchez, in an effort that was to secure him the polka-dot jersey of the top climber, moved on to take second place. Despite a flurry of late attacks, Evans and both Schleck brothers finished on the same time. Andy Schleck assumed leadership of the overall classification. As had happened on the previous stage, more than half the field had to rely on a reprieve from the commissionaires having missed the cut-off time, but the penalty points made little difference to the green jersey competition as the two leaders in that classification both received the same sanction.\nStage 20.\nIn the final competitive stage of the race, riders left in reverse order of their standings in the general classification. Fabian Cancellara, the world champion at the time trial, was widely considered favourite to win the stage, and his time was the fastest for some time, but it was surpassed by Richie Porte and, shortly after, by Thomas De Gendt, before Tony Martin set the best time at every intermediate checkpoint, and at the stage finish, times which remained unbeaten. Pierre Rolland, although he lost his place in the top ten to Jean-Christophe Péraud, was able to retain his lead in the young riders' category ahead of Rein Taaramäe. Defending champion Alberto Contador, in posting the time which was second at the time, moved up one place in the overall rankings, before the final three riders, whose compared times were to be decisive in the final positions for the tour. It was widely expected that the 57 second advantage that Andy Schleck had over Cadel Evans at the beginning of the stage would leave the pair very closely matched, but even by the first checkpoint in seemed evident that Evans would more than make up the deficit. Evans beat Contador's time, to take second on the stage, and to pass both Andy and Fränk Schleck and assume the lead in the overall classification.\nStage 21.\nAfter a silent tribute to Laurent Fignon and the victims of the attacks in Oslo and Utøya Island, and in keeping with tradition, the final stage began at a slow pace, and was a largely ceremonial procession through the suburbs of Paris. Shortly after the riders reached the circuit in the centre of the city, racing began in earnest, and after various unsuccessful attempts, the main break was initiated by Ben Swift () with 40 km to go, and he was joined by Kristjan Koren (), Sergio Paulinho (), Christophe Riblon () and Lars Bak (). At the intermediate sprint, with 35 km remaining, Mark Cavendish () extended his lead in the points competition, and shortly after that the breakaway reached its greatest advantage at 45 seconds. As the peloton closed down their advantage, mainly through the work of and , the breakaway lost members, until in the final kilometre only Bak remained clear, but the closing peloton was being driven by his own team. The lead-out train for Cavendish led the race through the final corners, and he won the final stage for the third successive year, a record, to become the first British winner of the green jersey. The leaders of the other three categories finished in the peloton to secure their victories, and the traditional prize-giving was made shortly after the race."

        "text": "The Pan American Games sports comprise all the sports contested in the Summer Olympic Games. In addition, traditional and popular sports throughout the Americas which are not contested at the Olympic Games are also contested such as bowling and baseball. As of 2015, the Pan American Games included 36 sports with 51 disciplines and 364 events. The number and kinds of events may change slightly from one Pan American Games to another.\nSports, disciplines, events.\nFor purposes of Pan American Games competition, the Pan American Sports Organization (PASO) makes a distinction between sports and disciplines. A sport, in Pan American Games terms, is a single or group of disciplines as represented by an international governing body, namely an International Federation. For example, aquatics, represented at the Olympic level by the International Swimming Federation, is a sport at the Pan American Games that includes the swimming, diving, synchronized swimming and water polo disciplines.\nEvery Summer Olympic discipline is currently on the Pan American Games program. The last such discipline to be added was canoe slalom, which made its debut in 2015 in Toronto, Canada. The discipline had been scheduled to be held at both the 2007 and 2011 Pan American Games, but had been dropped both times due to the small number of competing countries. The Games also include some disciplines which have never been contested at a Summer Olympics. Examples can be found in baseball and softball, now considered a single Pan Am Games sport due to sharing a single international federation. Both were last contested in the Olympics in 2008 and will return in 2020, but baseball has been strictly for men and softball for women. In the Pan Am Games, men's softball has been on the program on several occasions, most recently in 2015; women's baseball made its debut in 2015.\nMedals are awarded on a per-event basis; there can be one or more events per sport or discipline. In fact, every current Pan American Games discipline has at least two events.\nChanges.\nThe Pan American Games charter establishes that they comprise the program of the Games, the 28 compulsory sports of the program of the Olympic Games plus seven sports recognized by the entity, due to its popularity in the American continent, if a new sport becomes Olympic it is automatically added to the program of the Pan American Games. This only happens, if the number of national federations in the Americas is sufficient. In the same way that it happens in the Universiade, the Organizing Committee of the each edition can request the inclusion of new sports or disciplines, respecting the local demands. An example of this is the removal of the Basque pelota in the program of the Games of 2007 and 2015 and its replacement respectively by futsal. and the woman's baseball tournament.\nUntil the 2011 Games in Guadalajara, just one olympic event was never held, the canoe slalom. The event was planned to be held in the 2007 and 2011 editions, but was eventually canceled due to the low number of entries. Thus, the event was held for the first time at the 2015 Games.\nPrevious Pan American Games have included sports which are no longer present on the current program, like futsal and polo.\nThe International Olympic Committee voted on October 9, 2009, during the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen, to elevate both rugby sevens and golf as official Olympic sports and to include them in the Olympics, beginning with the 2016 Olympic Games. \nWith this development, rugby sevens made its debut at the 2011 Pan American Games in Guadalajara, and golf was played at the 2015 Pan American Games before becoming an Olympic sport.\nIn 2015, as a result of a request from the organizing committee, PASO decided to include surfing in the 2019 Pan American Games program. The following year, a few days before the opening ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics, surfing was integrated to the 2020 Summer Olympics program.\nCurrent Pan American Games program.\nThe following sports (or disciplines of a sport) make up the current Pan American Games official program and are listed alphabetically according to the name used by PASO. The figures in each cell indicate the number of events for each sport contested at the respective Games; a bullet () denotes that the sport/discipline was scheduled to be competed, but was dropped due to a lack of entries.\nNine of the 39 sports (Aquatics, Basketball, Canoeing, Cycling, Football, Gymnastics, Volleyball, Equestrian and Wrestling) consist of multiple disciplines. Disciplines from the same sport are grouped under the same heading:\nFor equestrian and wrestling, the figures in each cell indicate the number of events for each sport, and not for each discipline separately.\nMultiple new sports and events were added to the next edition of the games in 2023. The new sports are breaking, skateboarding and sport climbing.\nThe following sports have been contested at the Pan American Games:\nDiscontinued sports.\nThe following sports were previously part of the Pan American Games program as official sports, but are no longer on the current program."

The team competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I and are members of the Big Ten Conference.\nBeginning play in 1884, the Spartans have made the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship 5 times, advancing to the College World Series once, in 1954, with a third-place finish. The team has won 4 Big Ten conference championships and 5 Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association titles. The team played in the MIAA until 1907 and played as an independent until the university joined the Big Ten in 1949 and the Spartan baseball team began Big Ten play in 1951.\nSpartan baseball Hall of Famer.\nRobin Roberts initially came to East Lansing as part of a United States Army Air Corps training program in 1944. After the war ended in 1945, he took his leave of the service and returned to MSC (the name was Michigan State College at the time) to play basketball. Roberts was twice named captain, earning three varsity letters in basketball. After his second season playing basketball, Roberts tried out for the Michigan State baseball team, becoming a pitcher because it was the position that coach John Kobs needed most. After playing for Michigan State, going 9–6 over two seasons, with 6 shutouts in the 1946 season, he was signed by the Philadelphia Phillies in 1948. Roberts would go on to win 286 games, with 7 Major League Baseball All-Star Game appearances in a 19-year Major League Baseball career. Roberts was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1976.\nIn 1992, Roberts was one of 30 members of the charter class of former Michigan State Spartans athletes, coaches, and administrators inducted into the MSU Athletics Hall of Fame. His number 36 is retired, one of only five Spartan baseball players to receive the honor.\nOther notable Spartans.\nEd Pinnance made history for Michigan State baseball as the first Spartan (the school was called State Agricultural College at the time with the nickname Aggies) to advance to the major leagues, appearing in 1903 for the Philadelphia Athletics, and was also among the first full-blooded Native Americans to play in MLB. Tom Yewcic was named the College World Series Most Outstanding Player of the 1954 College World Series despite his team not reaching the championship game and would have a brief professional career with the Detroit Tigers. Yewcic was a two-sport star at Michigan State, leading the 1953 football team to a Rose Bowl win. Earl Morrall was a teammates of Yewcic on the 1954 College World Series team, led the 1955 football team to a Rose Bowl victory, and chose a career in the National Football League where he won 4 Super Bowls and an NFL MVP trophy in a 21-year career. Dick Radatz earned first-time All Big Ten honors in 1959, going 10–1, 1.12 ERA, and was a two-time MLB All-Star with the Boston Red Sox in 7-year pro career. A teammate of Radatz, Ron Perranoski would leave a stellar collegiate career in East Lansing for an MLB career, twice leading the league in saves, and twice helping his team win the World Series in his 13-year stint in the majors.\nThe Major League Baseball draft began in 1965 and the Spartans would be represented in the first year when Dick Billings was drafted in the 25th round by the Washington Senators as the first Michigan State player ever drafted. Billings would go on to a 8-year MLB career. Steve Garvey was a two-sport athlete at Michigan State, earning a letter as a defensive back for the football team, and would earn All Big Ten and All American honors in 1968 on his way to the majors where he would earn a World Series ring with the Los Angeles Dodgers as a 10-time MLB All-Star. Rick Miller was a Sporting News First Team All-American in 1969 for Michigan State and then won a Gold Glove for the California Angels in 1978 in his 15-year MLB career as a defensive standout. \nIn 1974, Spartan coach Danny Litwhiler pioneered the use of radar to measure pitching velocity. Litwiler said, “One day in 1974 while I was the coach at Michigan State, I read an article in the student paper that said ‘Don’t Speed on Campus’ and there was a photo of an MSU policeman who had just received a new radar gun. That got me thinking—could we use it to check the velocity of the baseball? So I found out that the cops’ radar guns were powered by the cigarette lighters in their police cars. So, we got an MSU police car to drive out on the field to time the pitches and the readouts were accurate within one mph each time. Within one week, I had the prototype of the JUGS gun in my hands and today that same prototype is in the Hall of Fame.\" Litwhiler also invented 'Diamond Grit' to help dry out fields after rain.\nFollowing the two-sport tradition, Kirk Gibson would lead the 1978 Michigan State Spartans football team to a co-Big Ten championship. It was at the suggestion of Spartan football coach Darryl Rogers that Gibson play collegiate baseball. Gibson played only one year of college baseball, but managed to hit .390 with 16 homers and 52 RBIs in 48 games. He was drafted by both his hometown Detroit Tigers baseball team (first round) and the St. Louis Cardinals football team (seventh round). He chose baseball and won two World Series titles in an illustrious 17-year career.\nMark Mulder would earn All Big Ten honors twice for the Spartans (1997, 1998) on his way to a professional career with two MLB All-Star appearances and a 21–8 2001 season for the Oakland Athletics which was captured in the book and film Moneyball. Bob Malek (2002) and Jeff Holm (2011) both were named the Big Ten Conference Baseball Player of the Year, the only two Spartans honored since the award was created in 1982. Malek finished his career as one of the most decorated Spartans ever with several national awards and is only the second Spartan in history to be a two-time member (2001-2002) of the .400 club (.400 or better batting average), joining Don Fleser, who did so in 1925-1926. Kurt Wunderlich was the Big Ten Pitcher of the Year in 2011, the only Spartan hurler to be so recognized since the award was created in 1994. Second baseman Ryan Jones was named to the All-Big Ten team three consecutive seasons (2010–2012) and had a 33-game hitting streak, a Spartan record.\nRecognizing the combination of athletic and academic performance, a number of Spartan baseball players have won the prestigious Big Ten Medal of Honor, including Ty Willingham (1977), who would go on to a successful college football coaching career at Notre Dame and Stanford. Other winners from Spartan baseball are Mike Davidson (1988), Stuart Hirschman (1992), Brandon Eckerle (2011) and Bryce Kelley (2021).\nFive Spartan players (Roberts, Garvey, Yewcic, Gibson, Mulder) and two coaches (John Kobs and Danny Litwhiler), have their numbers retired in East Lansing. In addition, the stadium is named after Drayton McLane, a Michigan State alumnus and former owner of the Houston Astros. McLane and his wife Elizabeth donated funds to begin renovations of the stadium, located at the historic Old College Field, and the updated facility quickly made history when, on April 4, 2009, the first official game in the new stadium was played, and Spartan pitcher Nolan Moody threw a no-hitter against Northwestern. McLane donated funds for the building of the football facility at Baylor University, also named McLane Stadium. The baseball field was named for Spartan coach John Kobs in 1969."

Returning as head coach was Hall of Famer Mike Krzyzewski. The team played its home games at Cameron Indoor Stadium in Durham, North Carolina as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference. They ended the season with 27–7 overall record, 13–3 in ACC play, finishing in 2nd place. In the 2012 ACC men's basketball tournament they reached the semifinals, when they were defeated by eventual champs Florida State. They earned a #2 seed in the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, but lost to #15 seed Lehigh in the round of 64.\nPrevious season.\nFollowing the 2009–2010 basketball team, the 2010–11 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team began the season ranked #1 in the nation and held that title for the first nine weeks of the season going 15–0, until being defeated for the first time on January 12 again Florida State. The only non-conference loss during the regular season came again St. John's weeks later. Duke split the two regular season match ups with in state arch rival North Carolina who would eventually clinch the ACC regular season championship against Duke in the last game of the season, a 67–81 Duke loss. However, Duke would beat North Carolina in the ACC tournament, which allowed Duke to take the conference tournament title and go 2–1 against the Tar Heels on the season. Duke would end up a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament, defeating Hampton and Michigan in the first two rounds of the tournament, and eventually lost to the Arizona Wildcats in the Sweet Sixteen, ending Duke's bid for a second straight championship, ending the season with an overall 32–5 record.\nSeason summary.\nAfter a series of victories in exhibition games overseas in China and Dubai, Duke returned to Durham and kicked off the season with home victories over two foes. The team then traveled to New York City's Madison Square Garden to face Michigan State in the Champions Classic. Duke's five-point victory was Mike Krzyzewski's 903rd win of his career, placing him atop the list of the winningest coaches in Division I history. Coach K surpassed his former coach and mentor, Bob Knight, as Knight watched courtside while doing the color commentary for ESPN.\nDuke's squad next participated in the Maui Invitational, and defeated two ranked opponents in #15 Michigan and Big 12 favorite and 14th ranked Kansas in the semifinals and championship, respectively. Tyler Thornton hit two key three-pointers with less than a minute and half to secure the 7-point victory in the championship game. Ryan Kelly was named MVP of the tournament for his performance, including 17 points against Kansas. As part of the ACC-Big Ten Challenge, Duke traveled to Columbus, Ohio in its first true road test of the season to face Big Ten favorite and #2 ranked Ohio State. OSU roared out to an 11–0 lead and never relinquished, ending up routing Duke by 22 points.\nDuke returned home and earned another win before heading to Madison Square Garden again to defeat the Washington Huskies. The team then rattled off a few more victories before facing another challenging road battle in Philadelphia against the Temple Owls. The game was a back-and-forth affair, but Khalif Wyatt of Temple made two key 3s in leading his team to the five-point victory.\nThe ACC season began with Duke earning four victories, including against #16 Virginia. However, their ACC winning streak was snapped by Florida State when Michael Snaer hit a buzzer beating three-pointer to stun the Duke home crowd. After victories over Maryland, St. John's, and Virginia Tech, Duke again lost at home to Miami in overtime by 4 after going 0–6 from the free throw stripe in the extra session. Duke was in a second-place tie in the league standings with FSU.\nThat set up a showdown with league-leading and fifth ranked North Carolina. Carolina came in as a heavy favorite in the rivalry game, but the Blue Devils stuck with the Tar Heels for most of the game behind a barrage of three-pointers. Tyler Zeller of Carolina dominated the first half with his shooting and rebounding, but the Tar Heels only secured a 3-point lead going into the intermission. Carolina then extended their lead to 10 with about 3 minutes remaining, which set up a furious comeback rally by the gritty Devils.\nDuke hit 14 threes in the game and Austin Rivers led the effort with 29 points. Tyler Thornton began the comeback with a 3 with about two minutes remaining. Ryan Kelly also chipped in with a baseline jumper late, and the Tar Heels couldn't seal the victory as they missed key free throws in the closing moments. The Blue Devils trailed by three when Zeller accidentally tipped in an errant three-point attempt by Duke, which put Duke within 1. Zeller made a free throw on the other end and Duke had 13.9 seconds left to draw up a play. After a screen on Rivers' defender, Zeller made the defensive switch and Rivers sank a long-range three over the outstretched arms of the 7-footer as time expired. The Rivers' shot is yet another performance to be added to the rivalry's lore and the buzzer beating play has been viewed by nearly 2 million people on YouTube.\nFollowing the emotional high from the comeback victory against Duke's chief rival, the squad did not let up, reeling off 6 straight victories against ACC opponents. This streak included the largest second-half comeback victory in Coach K's tenure when the NC State Wolfpack held a 16-point lead going into intermission. They extended the lead to 20 with minutes remaining in the game, but Duke rallied back and ended up with a 5-point victory. The team also had a road test at Florida State and came away with an impressive revenge victory to bring them back to the top of the ACC standings. That set up another season-ending showdown with North Carolina with the regular season ACC championship and #1 seed in the ACC tournament on the line. In front a home crowd and senior night, the Devils came out trailing and the Tar Heels made a statement in a game in which they never trailed. Duke got to within 11 in the second half, but it ended as an 18-point thumping at the hands of Duke's rival. Duke earned the #2 seed in the ACC tournament.\nAs the Blue Devils prepared for the ACC tournament in nearby Greensboro, Duke's third leading scorer and rebounder as well as the highest percentage shooter from 3-point land, Ryan Kelly, suffered what was reported as a sprained foot. With Kelly out of the lineup, Duke went small as they narrowly defeated the pesky Virginia Tech Hokies in the second round after receiving a bye.\nThat set up the rubber match with Florida State with a trip to the championship game on the line. Florida State build a double digit lead on Duke in the second half, but Duke fought back, bringing the status of the game into question. Rivers layup with 42 seconds remaining brought the Devils to within 1. However, the Seminoles responded with points of their own and Rivers badly missed a long three-pointer with 6 seconds remaining. The Devils corralled the rebound after a loose ball scramble ended up in the hands of Curry, but he could only manage a desperation heave that rimmed out as time expired, securing the 3-point victory for Florida State. The Seminoles went on to defeat North Carolina for the ACC championship the next day.\nDuke earned a #2 seed in the South Regional in the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament with the overall #1 seed and tournament favorite Kentucky at the top of the region, exactly 20 years after the famous buzzer beating shot by Christian Laettner against Kentucky in the Elite 8. Kelly continued to be listed as day to day and Duke was matched up with Lehigh from the Patriot League in the round of 64. The Devils were favored by 12.5 points in the matchup, but Lehigh looked to be the better team that night.\nNBA prospect C.J. McCollum lit up the Devils for 30 points in leading the Mountain Hawks to a 5-point upset victory, while the Devils struggled mightily from 3-point land going 6 for 26. It was the second 15 seed that defeated a 2 seed that day as Missouri also fell victim to the upset bug after it had only happened four times previously in history. Kelly did not make an appearance in the matchup and shortly thereafter had surgery and was sidelined for 6–8 weeks. The loss resulted in a disappointing finish for the Duke squad after a successful season, which included the comeback victory against North Carolina (who earned a #1 seed in the tournament) and wins versus #1 seed and Big Ten Champion Michigan State and #2 seed and Big 12 regular season champion Kansas in the championship of the Maui Invitational.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=| ACC Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=| NCAA tournament"

        "text": "The Breeders' Cup Juvenile Sprint was an ungraded American Thoroughbred horse race established in 2011 as part of the annual Breeders' Cup World Championships. The race, open to two-year-old colts, geldings and fillies, carried a purse of $500,000.\nThe inaugural running took place on the first day of the Breeders' Cup at the 2011 host track, Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky.\nDue to technical requirements, the race was not eligible for classification as a graded stakes race in its two runnings. The American Graded Stakes Committee of the Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association, the body that controls grading of North American stakes races, requires that a race be run under the same conditions for at least two years before it can be graded.\nIn March 2013, the Breeders' Cup board of directors voted to drop the race from its program of championships after it had only five competitors in 2012. \"The number of starters and overall quality of the Juvenile Sprint fields for its two runnings did not meet the standards expected for the Championships,\" said Craig Fravel, Breeders’ Cup president and CEO. \"We also believe that the Juvenile Sprint had a negative impact on field sizes for both the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile and Juvenile Fillies.\"\nThe small field for the 2012 race was attributed in part to the newly enacted ban on the race-day use of Furosemide for two-year-olds competing in the Breeders' Cup. The drug, also known as Lasix, is widely used by North American trainers to inhibit pulmonary bleeding in a horse that has just raced. It is not allowed to be used on race day in most of the world's other racing jurisdictions. The 2011 winner Secret Circle went on to win the Breeders' Cup Sprint in 2013.\nRecords.\nMost wins by a jockey:\nMost wins by a trainer:\nMost wins by an owner:"

The club was founded in 1895 as the Jamaica Cricket Club by ex-students of Calabar Elementary School, organised by David Ellington, a hackney cab driver. Robert Slade Lucas, the captain of a team from England visiting Jamaica at the time, donated equipment to assist in the establishment of the fledgling club. In 1898, the club renamed itself to honour Lucas' role in its foundation.\nThe formation of the club has been described as \"the most important event in the history of the island game\" as it provided an avenue for poor black cricketers to play the game, leading it to becoming the national sport of Jamaica.\nThe club's performance in the lower division of Jamaican cricket soon saw them offered a position in the Senior Cup, the premier cricket competition in Jamaica. The club was almost instantly successful, finishing runners-up in 1903 and winning in 1904, 1905 and 1906.\nFamous cricketers who have played for Lucas CC include:"

The BRFC shares its origins with the Portland Rugby Club, making it one of the oldest rugby teams in the state of Maine. It is one of the largest non-varsity sports teams at Bowdoin.\nHistory.\nIn 1969, an undergrad named John Philipsborn was kicked off the lacrosse team and with the encouragement of the Bowdoin College President Roger Howell, cobbled together a small group of students and men from Portland, Maine, to learn about a sport that at the time was very foreign to most people at Bowdoin. This group informally existed for a couple years—the first match was against Brown (lost)—but they did beat Dartmouth during the first season. After a few seasons, the Portland players split off to form the Portland Rugby Club.\nBy the mid 1970s, rugby at Bowdoin had fizzled out when a student named Tom Gimbel ('76) started it anew. Gimbel recruited a group of players that formed the organization that exists today, including Geoff Rusack, Peter Bernard and Jes Staley, former Barclays CEO. \nDuring the mid-seventies era, and the club's knowledge of rugby was sustained by visiting professors and exchange students. Traditions were developed and passed down from class to class by upper classmen.\nIn the early 1980s, a visiting professor math professor named Rob Curtis helped the team for a few seasons under the leadership of Chris Messerly and Neil Moses.\nWomen's rugby began in the early 1980s—encouragement and coaching provided by Bowdoin rugger David Weir.\nIn the mid-1980s, a local Maine resident named Brad Osborn informally helped coach the club. In 1985, a (well deserved) suspension rocked the team and Andy Palmer ‘88 and other players recruited Rick Scala to start coaching and providing supervision per the request of then Bowdoin Athletic Director Sid Watson—Scala's first season was the fall of 1986.\nIn 1991, the mighty Bowdoin team defeated Middlebury College to win the NESCAC championship.\nBowdoin Ruggers have been selected to represent the New England Rugby Union, the Northeast Rugby Union as well as the All-American Rugby Team. The team is known for its strengths on the field as well as off.\nThe Bowdoin Men's Rugby Club won the John Hayes Award in 2007. The John Hayes Award is given annually to one team in the New England Rugby Football Union for sportsmanship.\nIn 2022, the Bowdoin Men's Rugby Club led the nation in NCR Scholastic All-Americans, with 14 players receiving the honor."

After his junior year, he was selected in the second round of the 2011 NBA draft, and began his professional career with the Minnesota Timberwolves.\nEarly years.\nLee was born in Riverside, California, to Toshio and Delma Lee. He attended John W. North High School in Riverside.\nConsidered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Lee was listed as the No. 5 shooting guard and the No. 47 player in the nation in 2008.\nLee was named to the All-Pac-10 first team and Pac-10 All-Defensive team in his junior year at UCLA in 2011. He declared for the NBA draft after the season against the advice of UCLA coach Ben Howland. ESPN, Fox Sports, and Yahoo also questioned Lee's decision.\nProfessional career.\nLee was drafted in the second round of the 2011 NBA draft with the 43rd overall pick by the Chicago Bulls.

For sponsorship reasons, this competition is known as FxPro Super Rugby in Australia, Investec Super Rugby in New Zealand and Vodacom Super Rugby in South Africa. Including its past incarnations as Super 12 and Super 14, this was the 17th season for the Southern Hemisphere's premier transnational club competition. The conference games took place every weekend from 24 February until 14 July (with a three-week break between rounds 15 and 16 for international matches), followed by the finals series, culminating in the grand final on 4 August. While its three main broadcasting partners are Fox Sports (Australia), Sky Sport (New Zealand) and SuperSport (South Africa), Super Rugby can be viewed in many countries throughout the world.\nThe Chiefs, based in Hamilton, New Zealand, claimed their first-ever title in the competition's history, defeating the Durban-based Sharks 37–6 in the final held on 4 August at the Chiefs' home of Waikato Stadium.\nCompetition format.\nCovering 24 weeks, the schedule featured a total of 125 matches. The 15 teams are grouped by geography, labelled the Australian Conference, New Zealand Conference and the South African Conference. The regular season consists of two types of matches:\nThe top team of each conference, plus the next top three teams in table points regardless of conference (wild card teams), advance to the finals. The top two conference winners, based on table points, receive first-round byes. In the first round of the finals, the third conference winner is the No. 3 seed and hosts the wild card team with the worst record, and the best wild card team hosts the second-best wild card team. In the semi-finals, the No. 2 conference winner hosts the higher surviving seed from the first round, and the No. 1 conference winner hosts the other first-round winner. The final is hosted by the top remaining seed.\nRegular season.\nThe following fixtures were released on 2 September 2011.\nReferees.\nThe following refereeing panel was appointed by SANZAR for the 2012 Super Rugby season:"

        "title": "Equestrian Portrait of Charles I",
        "text": "The Equestrian Portrait of Charles I (also known as Charles I on Horseback) is a large oil painting on canvas by Anthony van Dyck, showing Charles I on horseback. Charles I had become King of England, Scotland and Ireland in 1625 on the death of his father James I, and Van Dyck became Charles's Principal Painter in Ordinary in 1632.\nThe portrait is thought to have been painted in about 1637–38, only a few years before the English Civil War broke out in 1642. It is one of many portraits of Charles by Van Dyck, including several equestrian portraits. It is held by the National Gallery, London.\nBackground.\nThis is the second equestrian portrait of Charles to be painted by Van Dyck. Charles is depicted wearing the same suit of armour, riding a heavily muscled dun horse with a peculiarly small head. To the right, a page proffers a helmet. Charles appears as a heroic philosopher king, contemplatively surveying his domain, carrying a baton of command, with a long sword to his side, and wearing the medallion of the Sovereign of the Order of the Garter. His melancholy, distant expression was seen as a sign of wisdom. He wears the same suit of tilt armour in both equestrian paintings (although the last Royal tilt had been held in 1616, and another proposed in 1622 had been abandoned due to bad weather). A tablet tied to a branch reads (Charles I King of Great Britain) – a political statement at the time, only 33 years after James had united the crowns of Scotland and England, and proclaimed himself King of Great Britain, and nearly 70 years before the Acts of Union legally created the Kingdom of Great Britain.\nAn earlier equestrian portrait, \"Charles I with M. de St Antoine\", c. 1633, depicts Charles under a Roman triumphal arch, clad in armour and accompanied by his riding master, Pierre Antoine Bourdon, Seigneur de St Antoine. Van Dyck painted one other major portrait of Charles I with a horse: \"Charles I at the Hunt\" (\"Le Roi à la chasse\", c.1635, now in the Louvre), which depicts Charles standing next to a horse in civilian clothing, as if resting on a hunt, wearing a wide-brimmed Cavalier hat and leaning on a walking cane, gazing at a coastal scene; a picture of \"gentlemanly nonchalance and regal assurance\".\nVan Dyck's portraits of Charles on horseback echo the imperial tone of Titian's equestrian portrait of Emperor Charles V from 1548, itself inspired by equestrian portraits of Roman emperors. In c.1620, Van Dyck painted a similar . The composition may also borrow from Dürer’s 1513 engraving \"Knight, Death and the Devil\".\nThis is one of several closely contemporaneous works depicting Charles riding a horse as a means to increase his stature. Charles stood only high, and was keenly conscious of his height. In addition to the paintings, a near life-size equestrian statue of Charles I by Hubert Le Sueur was erected at Charing Cross in 1633 (although originally commissioned in 1630 for Lord Weston's garden in Roehampton; it now stands to the south of Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square). A design by Inigo Jones for a triumphal arch at Temple Bar was intended to bear another equestrian statue of Charles.\nPainting materials.\nThe investigation of the painting and its pigment analysis was done by scientists at the National Gallery London. Van Dyck used the usual pigments of his time such as smalt, ochres, vermilion, red lake and azurite for the rather subdued tones and subtle colours.\nProvenance.\nThe painting was listed in the first catalogue of the Royal Collection, compiled in 1637–40. The very large painting, high by wide, was hung at the end of a long gallery at Hampton Court Palace. The Royal Collection was dispersed under the Commonwealth, and the painting was sold to Sir Balthazar Gerbier, formerly the king's agent in Antwerp, for £200 on 21 June 1650. It was acquired by Gisbert van Ceulen, who sold it to Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria and Governor of the Spanish Netherlands, in 1698, but was soon taken from Munich as booty of war by Emperor Joseph I. He presented the painting to John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, in November 1706.\nIt was displayed at Blenheim Palace until the 8th Duke of Marlborough sold it to the National Gallery in 1895 for £17,500. It is usually exhibited in Room 21. The modern Royal Collection includes a smaller version, possibly a \"modello\" but perhaps a reduced later version."

        "title": "Tennessee Volunteers women's rowing",
        "text": "The Tennessee Volunteers women's rowing team is the most recently added sport at the University of Tennessee (UT). The team began in 1995 and since then has grown to new heights. Since 2014, the team has competed in the Big 12 Conference, which took over the rowing league formerly operated by Conference USA. UT is joined in Big 12 rowing by one of its historic rivals in its all-sports league, the Southeastern Conference, in Alabama. The Volunteers, then known as Lady Volunteers, won their first conference championship in 2010.\nAlong with other UT women's sports teams, it used the nickname \"Lady Volunteers\" (or the short form \"Lady Vols\") until the 2015–16 school year, when the school dropped the \"Lady\" prefix from the nicknames of all women's teams except in basketball. In 2017 the “Lady Vol” name was reinstated.\nOverview.\nDuring Lisa Glenn's 19-year stint at UT she has helped guide the 22-year program to seven appearances at the NCAA Championships, including three consecutive full-team selections in 2006, 2007, and 2008. Glenn helped propel the Lady Vols to new heights in the 2010 season, leading the Lady Vols to its first-ever Conference-USA rowing championship. Glenn was also named C-USA Coach of the Year for her efforts in helping the Lady Vols accomplish this historic achievement. Under Glenn's guidance, senior Laura Miller was named the C-USA rower of the year, while three other Lady Vols captured All-Conference honors. Glenn is only the second coach in Lady Vol rowing history, Glenn has a strong track record of producing stellar student-athletes. Five Lady Vols have taken home All-America accolades. Former rower Erin-Monique Shelton garnered second-team honors for the third consecutive year in 2008, joining Chelsea Pemberton as the only Tennessee rowers to earn All-America honors three times in a row.\nIn 2007-08, the Lady Vol rowing team garnered new heights for the program. For the first time in Tennessee history, Head Coach Lisa Glenn guided one of her shells to the grand finals at the NCAA Championship, and the team’s third consecutive full-team appearance at the event. The fifth-place showing by the 2V8+ in the grand final was the programs best finish.\nTennessee Boathouse.\nWhen Coach Lisa Glenn arrived at UT she had a vision of a state of the art boat house for the Lady Vols rowing team to call home. Ground work for the Tennessee Boathouse began in September 1999 when the first shovel was driven into the ground on the north side of the Tennessee River. Now over ten years later, she and the team have a place to call home for the newest sports program at Tennessee. The three-story building is the permanent home of the University of Tennessee Lady Volunteer Rowing Team. The facility, located directly across the street from Neyland Stadium on the waterfront, anchors the west end of Knoxville's Volunteer Landing waterfront development and jettisons 40-feet out over the water with balconies overlooking the Tennessee River. The structure stands beside the \"Vol Navy\" docks. The 180-foot floating dock has enough space to launch three eights at once. The ground level boat bay holds 26 boats including singles, pairs, quads, fours and eights. The Tennessee River can be viewed through windows spanning the entire south wall.\nAll-Americans.\nThe Tennessee Volunteers rowing team has featured seven USRowing All-Americans/CRCA Pocock All-Americans"

        "text": "The 1999 Australian Open women's doubles was the women's doubles event of the eighty-seventh edition of the Australian Open, the first Grand Slam of the year and the most prestigious tournament in the Asia-Pacific and the Southern Hemisphere. Martina Hingis and Mirjana Lučić were the defending champions, but Hingis competed with Russian Anna Kournikova, and Lučić competed with Frenchwoman Mary Pierce. Lučić and Pierce were defeated in the first round by Christina Singer and Helena Vildová.\nHingis and Kournikova, however, ended up winning the title, defeating first seeds Lindsay Davenport and Natasha Zvereva, 7–5, 6–3. With this win, Hingis won her fifth consecutive Grand Slam title in doubles, and became the only woman to have won three consecutive Australian Open titles in singles and doubles simultaneously. Hingis and her partners defeated Davenport/Zvereva for all five consecutive women's doubles titles starting with the 1998 Australian and ending with the 1999 Australian Open. It was Davenport's fourth consecutive defeat at an Australian Open final."

        "text": "The men's qualification for the 2004 Olympic men's basketball tournament occurred from 2002–2003; all five FIBA (International Basketball Federation) zones sent in teams.\nThe first qualifying tournament was the 2002 FIBA World Championship in which the champion was guaranteed of a place in the Olympics. Throughout the next two years, several regional tournaments served as qualification for the zonal tournaments, which doubles as intercontinental championships, to determine which teams were to participate in the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics.\nQualification.\nA total of 12 teams took part in the Olympics, with each NOC sending in one team.\nThe host nation (Greece) qualified automatically as hosts.\nSerbia and Montenegro qualified automatically by winning at the 2002 FIBA World Championship.\nThe other 10 teams were determined by five zonal tournaments (doubling as continental championships), held in 2003. Each zone was allocated with the following qualifying berths:\nSummary.\nThese are the final standings of the different Olympic qualifying tournaments. The venues are as follows:\nFIBA Africa.\nThe FIBA Africa Championship 2003 at Egypt determined FIBA Africa's only outright representative to the Olympics.\nThe tournament is structured into a preliminary round of 12 teams divided into 2 groups; the top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stages (semifinals and final).\nAngola won the tournament, beating Nigeria in the final, 85–65.\nFIBA Americas.\nThe FIBA Americas Championship 2003 held in the Roberto Clemente Coliseum at San Juan, Puerto Rico determined the three teams representing FIBA Americas in the Olympics.\nThe tournament is structured into a preliminary round of ten teams divided into 2 groups; the top four teams from each group advance to a quarterfinals Round-robin tournament, where results between groupmates carry over. The top four teams advance to the semifinals, a knockout stage deciding the first four places.\nThe United States defeated Argentina 106–73 in the final, and hosts Puerto Rico earned the final spot by defeating Canada 79–66 in the bronze medal match.\nFIBA Asia.\nThe tournament held in Harbin, China is structured with a preliminary round of 16 teams divided into four groups, with the top two teams from each group advancing to the quarterfinals, where they'll be divided into two groups. The top two teams in the quarterfinals groups advance to the knockout semifinals and finals.\nChina defeated Korea 106–96 in the final, earning the only Asian berth for the Olympics.\nFIBA Europe.\nEuropean berths for the Olympic Games were decided at EuroBasket 2003, held in Sweden.\nThe tournament is structured with a preliminary round of 16 teams divided into four groups, where the top team from each group advances to the quarterfinals directly. The second and third places play an extra math against the third and second places from another group. The four winners gain a spot in the quarterfinal round.\nLithuania defeated Spain 93-84 in the final, while Italy earned the third Europe spot in a 69–67 victory against France in the bronze medal match.\nFIBA Oceania.\nThis time around, two spots were given to Oceania, so the only two competing nations had already qualified for the Olympic Tournament. Australia claimed the continental championship by defeating New Zealand in all three matches."

        "text": "Don Parish is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, and coached in the 1970s. An Australia international and New South Wales state representative goal-kicking or three-quarter back, he played club football in Sydney's NSWRFL Premiership for the Western Suburbs club, as well as elsewhere in New South Wales. Parish later coached Wests and Penrith.\nPlaying career.\nHailing from the country New South Wales town of Dubbo, Parish played for the Macquarie club, becoming their first international when he was selected to go on the 1959/60 Kangaroo tour.\nIn 1959 Parish scored a try and kicked three goals in the New South Wales team's loss to Queensland that attracted 35,261 spectators, smashing Brisbane's previous record for an interstate match of 22,817. Later that year he became Kangaroo No. 358 when selected as a non-playing reserve in the Test series against New Zealand. Parish then toured with the 1959-60 Kangaroos and played in 12 matches (no Tests) and scored 55 points (7 tries, 17 goals).\nParish started playing first grade in the Sydney premiership for the Western Suburbs club in the 1961 NSWRFL season and that year toured New Zealand with the Australian side, making his Test debut. In the 12-10 First Test loss in Auckland he had the distinction of becoming the first Australian fullback to score a try in a Test match and was the tour's leading point-scorer with 58 points (4 tries, 23 goals). At the end of the season he played at fullback in Wests' loss to St. George in the grand final.\nIn 1962 Parish played in Australia's First Test loss to Great Britain, which was his last international match. That season he was the League's top point-scorer. In 1963 he again played fullback for Wests in another grand final defeat by St. George. Parish's last season playing for Wests was 1967.\nCoaching career.\nFollowing his retirement from the playing field, Parish coached on the Southern New South Wales coast, taking the Illawarra Rugby League's Western Suburbs club to premierships in 1969 and 1970, as well as coaching the Illawarra group team to victory in the Country Divisional Championship.\nAt the end of the 1971 NSWRFL season Parish was appointed to take over from Ron Watson as Western Suburbs' first grade coach. He coached the club until 1976, moving to Penrith in 1977. Half-way through the 1978 NSWRFL season, Len Stacker was appointed to replace Parish as Penrith head coach at the season's end."

Joyner Holmes was the leading scorer with 24 points.\nIn the semi-final game against Hungary, the US team gave up 26 points in the first quarter, but still managed to end the quarter with a six-point lead, largely due to six three-pointers hit by Samuelson, a US Women’s U17 record.

        "text": "Agassi Tennis Generation is a tennis sports game developed by Aqua Pacific and published by DreamCatcher Interactive for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2 and Game Boy Advance. The game features former tennis player Andre Agassi.\nGameplay.\nIn the PlayStation 2 version, the game features 16 tournaments and 12 courts. It has various court surfaces and three game modes: Quick Match, Arcade and Championship. There are 32 tennis players with varying abilities in speed, strength, and stamina. Championship offers players 10,000 dollars and a number of choices on which to spend it, e.g. coaches, personal trainers, talent agents etc.\nEach individual can help improve an athlete's abilities in specific areas over time. Quick Match drops players onto a court for a single match, while Arcade is designed to offer players a more simplified control scheme. Championship has players competing against a series of fictitious opponents on each of the 12 courts to win prize money. The PlayStation 2 version of the game features motion-capture animation from Agassi himself.\nIn the Game Boy Advance version, there are four modes: Quick Match, Arcade, Championship, and Multiplayer Multipack, which requires a link cable, another Game Boy Advance, and another copy of the game. Gamers choose from ten tennis player characters to compete in both single and double matches in courts set in the UK, France, Germany, Australia, Italy and the United States.\nReception.\nThe PlayStation 2 version received \"mixed\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Game Chronicles editor Mark Smith criticized the game for its \"total lack of practice modes, mini-games, or tutorials\" but stating that fans of the genre \"will appreciate the slick interface, fluid controls, and realistic gameplay\". GameSpot's Ryan Davis criticized the game for its \"short list of options, buggy gameplay, and generally tepid presentation\".\nThe PC version received mixed reviews, with Steve Hill of \"PC Zone\" stating \"Reviewing this on a borderline minimum spec PC, it proved to be muck of the highest order, with the computer controlled players largely incapable of hitting the ball, rendering matches little more than a banal sequence of unlikely aces and tedious double faults\" despite the fact that the A.I. players are \"able to return serves and take part in vaguely competitive rallies\" on a slightly more powerful PC."

        "text": "Waqar Younis, a retired Pakistani cricketer, took 35 five-wicket hauls during his career in international cricket. In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five–for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and only 41 bowlers have taken at least 15 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers. A right-arm fast bowler who represented his country between 1989 and 2003, the BBC described Waqar as \"one of the most feared fast bowlers in recent cricketing history\", while former Pakistan captain Imran Khan said that Waqar was \"a thinking cricketer and, at his peak, he was the most destructive bowler the game had seen\". The cricket almanack \"Wisden\" noted his \"pace and swing\", and named him one of their Cricketers of the Year in 1992. Waqar was inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame on 9 December 2013.\nWaqar made his Test debut in 1989 against India in Karachi, where he took four wickets in the first innings. His first Test five-wicket haul came the following year against New Zealand in a match which Pakistan won at Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore. He took a pair of five-wicket hauls in a single match against Zimbabwe at the Defence Stadium, Karachi in December 1993. His career-best figures for an innings were 7 wickets for 76 runs against New Zealand at Iqbal Stadium, Faisalabad, in October 1990. He went on to take ten or more wickets per match on five occasions.\nMaking his One Day International (ODI) debut in October 1989 against West Indies at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium (Sharjah), Waqar's first ODI five-wicket haul came the following year against Sri Lanka in a match which Pakistan won at the Sharjah. He achieved a hat-trick (three wickets in consecutive deliveries), against New Zealand in 1994. His career-best bowling in ODI cricket was 7 wickets for 36 runs, against England at Headingley in June 2001. He took three consecutive five-wicket hauls in ODI matches in November 1990. Retiring from international cricket in 2003 after nearly 14 years, Waqar took 22 five-wicket hauls in Test cricket and 13 in ODIs. As of November 2020, he is joint sixth (with Rangana Herath) overall among all-time combined five-wicket haul takers, and top of the equivalent ODI list."

They are in their 30th season as a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference. In their previous season, Temple compiled a record of 26–8 and reached the NCAA tournament. The team returned four starters from the previous season, but lost power forward Lavoy Allen to graduation. He is replaced by incoming recruit Will Cummings and transfer Dalton Pepper. Anthony Lee will be eligible after red shirting last year.\nPreseason.\nIn 2011–12, the Temple Owls men's basketball team were in their 30th season as a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference. Since 1997, the team has played their home games at the Liacouras Center, which has a capacity of 10,206. In the previous season, the Owls went 14–2 in Atlantic 10 play, earning a two seed in the 2011 Atlantic 10 men's basketball tournament, where they lost in the semifinals to Richmond. The team earned an at-large bid to the 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as a seven seed, and defeated Penn State in the round of 64 on a last-second shot by guard Juan Fernandez. The win snapped coach Fran Dunphy's 11-game losing streak in the NCAA Tournament, the longest on record. Temple's season ended with a double overtime loss to San Diego State in the round of 32 as the Owls compiled a record of 26–8.\nTemple lost starting power forward Lavoy Allen to graduation. As a senior, Allen placed third on the team in scoring with 11.6 points per game and led the team in rebounding with 8.6 rebounds per game. He was a three-time All-Atlantic 10 Defensive Team honoree and a two-time All-Atlantic 10 First Team selection. He finished his career as the school's all-time leading rebounder with 1,147 boards and ranks 24th on the career scoring list with 1,421 points. In the 2011 NBA draft, Allen was selected with the 50th overall pick by the Philadelphia 76ers. Reserve center Dutch Gaitley also graduated. After redshirting the 2010–11 season with foot injuries, forward Craig Williams transferred to Texas Christian University and was eligible to compete immediately.\nTemple assistant Matt Langel accepted the Colgate head coaching job on April 28, 2011. Langel had coached at Temple since Fran Dunphy was hired in 2006. Langel was responsible for recruiting Juan Fernandez to Temple, once driving ten hours in a compact car to find him. He was replaced by Boston University assistant Dwayne Killings. Killings served as assistant director of basketball operations at Temple from 2006 to 2009. In his only season at Boston University, Killings helped the team win the 2011 America East men's basketball tournament and earn a bid to the NCAA Tournament.\nOn October 13, 2011. Temple was predicted to finish second in the Atlantic 10 behind Xavier and received four first-place votes. Ramone Moore and Juan Fernandez were Preseason First Team All-Conference selections, Scootie Randall was a Preseason Third Team All-Conference selection, and Anthony Lee was a Preseason All-Rookie Team selection. Jeff Goodman of CBS Sports named Temple Owls the second best team in the Atlantic 10 and highlighted the development of Michael Eric and Anthony Lee as factors for a successful season.\nRecruiting.\nIncoming signees.\nThe sole member of the Owls' 2011 recruiting class was Will Cummings, a point guard from Jacksonville, Florida who committed on September 4, 2010.

Due to NCAA rules, he will be forced to sit out the 2011–12 season as a redshirt and will have two years of eligibility remaining. In his career at Pennsbury High School, Pepper scored a school-record 2,207 points, grabbed 962 rebounds, and garnered 2009 Pennsylvania Big School Player of the Year recognition from the Associated Press.

Other Hurricanes who played in the majors included Bud Bloomfield, Steve Bowling, Mark Calvert, Mardie Cornejo, Mike Sember, and Jerry Tabb.\nTulsa dropped its baseball program in 1980, citing rising costs and the need to fund a full women's sports program. Gene Shell, who had coached the program from 1965 to 1980, finished his career at Tulsa with a 478–199 record, and was the fourth winningest coach in college baseball when the program ended. In recent years, the university has been reported on several occasions to be considering whether to restore the baseball program; a formal study was conducted in 2009 after the Tulsa Drillers moved into their new downtown stadium, leaving Drillers Stadium potentially available for college baseball, but the school concluded that the financial demands of adding a new sport were more than it could accept."
