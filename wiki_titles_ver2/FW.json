        "text": "The 2017–18 season was Irish provincial rugby union side Connacht Rugby's seventeenth season competing in the Pro14, and the team's twenty-second season as a professional side. It was Kieran Keane's first and only season in charge of the side.\nConnacht finished sixth in their seven-team Pro14 conference. As well as playing in the Pro14, the team competed in the Challenge Cup in Europe. They finished first in their pool and advanced to the knockout stage as third seed overall, but were defeated at home by Gloucester in the quarter-finals. The second tier side the Connacht Eagles competed in the 2017–18 British and Irish Cup, finishing third in their pool.\nBackground.\nCompetition schedule.\nOn 30 June 2017, BBC Wales reported that the two South African teams being dropped from the Super Rugby competition, the Cheetahs and Southern Kings, would be immediately added to Pro12. Their involvement was confirmed on 1 August 2017. The 14 teams were split into two conferences of seven, with each conference featuring two teams each from Ireland and Wales and one team each from Italy, Scotland and South Africa. Connacht were named in Conference A. It was announced that each team would play the other teams in their own conference twice and those in the other conference once. In addition, Connacht would have two additional derby games against Leinster and Ulster, the Irish provinces in Conference B.\nConnacht were entered into the Challenge Cup in Europe, following a play-off defeat to Northampton Saints. The team was drawn in Pool 5 of the competition along with Brive, Worcester Warriors and Oyonnax.\nPersonnel changes.\nIn February 2017, Connacht announced that New Zealander Kieran Keane, Chiefs attack coach, had signed a three-year contract to become their new head coach, replacing Pat Lam who moved to Bristol. Following Keane's appointment, existing forwards coach Jimmy Duffy signed an extension to his deal and academy manager Nigel Carolan was promoted to backs coach, leaving his post as head coach of the Ireland under-20s to take the role. In May 2017, Peter Wilkins joined from Edinburgh as defence coach.\nAmong the prominent departures from the first team squad were Irish international scrum-half John Cooney, who joined Ulster, long-serving prop Ronan Loughney, who retired, and former Springbok Marnitz Boshoff, who departed a year earlier than initially planned for personal reasons. Incoming players included Australian flanker Jarrad Butler and prop Peter McCabe, who had previously been on loan with the team. The team also agreed a deal to sign international Eroni Vasiteri, but the move was called off after he received a nine-week ban for gouging. All Blacks Sevens player Pita Ahki was signed as a replacement.\nPlayers.\nSenior playing squad.\nThe Connacht senior squad for 2017–18 was:\nAcademy squad.\nThe Connacht academy squad for 2017–18 was:&lt;ref name=\"Connacht Rugby confirm Academy Squad for 2017/18 Season\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nPlaying kit.\nThe official Connacht team and support staff kit supplier for the season was Australian manufacturer BLK sport, who had supplied the full range of apparel for all of Connacht Rugby's representative teams and support staff since 2013. Connacht's main shirt sponsors were Irish sporting retailer Intersport Elverys, in the second year of a three-year deal.\nConnacht launched their new home kit for the season in July 2017, in the traditional green. The team launched new away and European kits in August 2017 during a pre-season friendly against former head coach Pat Lam's side Bristol, wearing the away kit in the first half and the European kit in the second half. The away kit was primarily cyan and white, with white shorts and socks, while the European kit was primarily blue and lime green, with blue shorts and lime green socks."

A maximum of 20 athletes per nation will be allowed to compete with a maximum of 12 males or 12 females from a nation being permitted.\nA standard.\nAn athlete with a maximum of 100 FIS distance points will be allowed to compete in both or one of the event (sprint/distance). An athlete with a maximum 120 FIS sprint points will be allowed to compete in the sprint event and 10 km for women or 15 km for men provided their distance points does not exceed 300 FIS points.\nB standard.\nNOC's who do not have any athlete meeting the A standard can enter one competitor of each sex (known as the basic quota) in the sprint event or 10 km freestyle event for women/15 km freestyle event for men. They must have a maximum of 300 FIS distance points at the end of qualifying on January 22, 2018. The qualification period began in July 2016.\nAllocation of quotas.\nEvery NOC will be assigned one male and one female quota spot by meeting the B standard.\nEvery NOC with at least one male and/or female in the top 300 of any event will be allocated one additional male and/or female quota in addition to the basic quota.\nEvery NOC with at least one male and/or female in the top 30 of any event will be allocated additional male and/or female quotas up to a maximum of 4.\nThe remaining quotas will be assigned using the Olympic Quota allocation list on 22 January 2018. The spots will be assigned until a maximum of 310 quotas are reached including the above. When a nation reaches its maximum, remaining athletes from that country will be skipped over. The list is a table of athletes in the top 500 in both events (distance and sprint).\nAn athlete can be counted only once for the above three criteria. For example, if a country has only one athlete meeting all three criteria then only one quota will be given (not 3).\nQuota allocation.\nCurrent quotas as of 26 January 2018 (after reallocation).\nNext eligible NOC.\nFifteen quota spots were made available for reallocation. After reallocation, team OAR reduced their team by an additional eight athletes. Bold indicates the acceptance of a quota, while a strike through indicates refusal."

This was the Chiefs' fifth Super Bowl appearance overall and third in the last four seasons, having previously won Super Bowls IV and LIV and lost Super Bowls I and LV.\nThe Chiefs won the game 38-35 on a game winning field goal by Harrison Butker. Butker's game-winning kick was set up by a pivotal defensive holding call on Philadelphia cornerback James Bradberry, which was criticized by some observers but supported by others, including Bradberry himself. The 73 combined points made this the third-highest scoring Super Bowl game, and the 35 points scored by the Eagles were the most by the losing team in the Super Bowl. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was named Super Bowl Most Valuable Player (MVP), completing 21 of 27 passes for 182 yards and three touchdowns. The three touchdowns and two-point conversion scored by Jalen Hurts tied the record for most points scored by a player in a Super Bowl with 20.\nFox's broadcast of the game became the then most-watched program in American television history, with an average of 115.1 million viewers. The halftime show, headlined by Rihanna, peaked at 121 million viewers. This record would later be broken the following year.\nBackground.\nHost selection.\nBeginning with Super Bowl LVI, a new system was introduced to select Super Bowl hosting sites. Discarding the previous process that allowed cities to submit bids for the hosting rights, the league unilaterally chooses a single hosting site for each game. The chosen city then creates a proposal that is voted upon at the league's owners' meetings. Arizona was the first location chosen under this process; its proposal was accepted unanimously on May 23, 2018.\nThe official logo was unveiled on February 14, 2022; it follows the updated logo template introduced by Super Bowl LVI, with imagery of a sunset resembling Arizona's state flag behind a desert canyon to reflect the landscapes of the host region.\nCalls for location change.\nIn February 2022, over 200 liberal religious leaders, including Rev. Jesse Jackson and Rev. Dr. William Barber II, petitioned NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to move Super Bowl LVII out of Arizona after they accused the Arizona legislature of enacting unnecessary voting restrictions with HB 1003, SB 1485, and SB 1819. Arizona Democratic Party vice-chair Brianna Westbrook also voiced her support to move the Super Bowl after the Arizona legislature passed SB 1138 and SB 1165, which restricts access to gender-affirming care for minors, and bans transgender girls from playing on girls' sports teams.\nIndigenous representation.\nThe game and surrounding festivities included acknowledgements of the Indigenous peoples of Arizona; the Ak-Chin Indian Community, Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation, Gila River Indian Community, and Tohono O'odham Nation were named as Host Committee Partners, and the official branding for the game features artwork by Lucinda \"La Morena\" Hinojos, featuring the White Tank Mountains adorned with 22 diamonds representing the Native American tribes that have a presence in Arizona. This marked the first time an Indigenous artist was commissioned to create the official artwork for the Super Bowl. An mural in downtown Phoenix was also commissioned in collaboration between Hinojos and other Indigenous artists.\nFor the first time, a land acknowledgment was read during a ceremony on February 6 attended by representatives of the Host Committee Partner tribes, while dance troupe Indigenous Enterprise performed during Super Bowl Opening Night, and as part of entertainment outside State Farm Stadium on the day of the game.\nThe presence of the Kansas City Chiefs led to continued calls against the use of Native American imagery by the team and its fans (including the \"tomahawk chop\"), including by the Kansas City Indian Center, the National Congress of American Indians, and the first Indigenous Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland. Groups of Indigenous activists organized a protest rally outside State Farm Stadium.\nStadium playing surface.\nThe NFL spent two years preparing the grass used in Super Bowl LVII. The field, made of Tahoma 31 grass, was grown at a local sod farm in Phoenix. Despite the field prep, multiple players could be seen slipping and falling on the surface. Players from both teams criticized the playing surface, and several players changed cleats during the game to get better traction. During their Week 1 matchup against the Arizona Cardinals, Chiefs players had complained of the playing surface at the time (it was replaced by February) which potentially led to injuries to Harrison Butker and Trent McDuffie.\nTeams.\nKansas City Chiefs.\nKansas City finished the season with their tenth consecutive winning record under head coach Andy Reid, going 14–3 and advancing to their third Super Bowl in the last four years with one-score wins over the Jacksonville Jaguars (Divisional Round) and Cincinnati Bengals (AFC Championship Game).\nThe Chiefs traded star wide receiver Tyreek Hill to the Miami Dolphins in the offseason for draft picks but still finished the year as the NFL's best offense, leading the league in yards (7,032) and points scored (496). Quarterback Patrick Mahomes made his fifth consecutive Pro Bowl and won his second NFL Most Valuable Player award, leading the league with a career-high 5,250 passing yards and 41 touchdowns while throwing 12 interceptions. His passer rating of 105.2 was the second-highest in the league. He also rushed for 354 yards and four touchdowns, setting the NFL record for most combined passing and rushing yards in a season with 5,608. Pro Bowl tight end Travis Kelce was the team's leading receiver with 1,338 receiving yards and 12 touchdowns. The team also added in a pair of veteran receivers to help make up for the loss of Hill: JuJu Smith-Schuster (933 yards and three touchdowns) and Marquez Valdes-Scantling (687 yards and two touchdowns). The Chiefs' running game was led by rookie Isiah Pacheco, who had stepped into the leading role due to a midseason injury to starter Clyde Edwards-Helaire. Pacheco finished the season with 830 rushing yards and five touchdowns while also gaining 130 receiving yards and returning kickoffs with an average of 20.6 yards per return. Veteran running back Jerick McKinnon added 803 yards from scrimmage and 10 touchdowns. Their offensive line featured three Pro Bowl selections: guard Joe Thuney, tackle Orlando Brown Jr., and center Creed Humphrey. Punter Tommy Townsend also made the Pro Bowl, ranking second in the NFL in yards per punt (50.4) and leading the league with a 45.4 net average.\nKansas City's defensive line featured Pro Bowl defensive tackle Chris Jones, who led the team with 15.5 sacks, along with defensive ends George Karlaftis (6 sacks, seven pass deflections) and Frank Clark (5 sacks). Linebacker Nick Bolton led the team with 180 combined tackles and two interceptions. The secondary was led by cornerback L'Jarius Sneed (three interceptions, 108 tackles, three forced fumbles, 3.5 sacks) and safety Juan Thornhill (three interceptions, 71 tackles).\nThis was Kansas City's fifth Super Bowl, following wins in Super Bowls IV and LIV and losses in Super Bowls I and LV. Prior to the Super Bowl era, the Chiefs won the American Football League championship in 1962.\nThe Super Bowl was the final for Norma Hunt, the widow of the Chiefs' founder, Lamar Hunt, who died in June 2023. She was a member (and the only woman) of the Never Miss a Super Bowl Club. She was a minority owner of the Chiefs at the time of her death.\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nUnder second-year head coach Nick Sirianni, the Eagles started the season winning eight consecutive games before finishing the season tied for an NFL-best 14–3 record and advancing to the Super Bowl by defeating their two playoff opponents (the New York Giants in the Divisional Round, and the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game) by a combined score of 69–14. The team excelled on both sides of the ball, scoring 477 points (third most in the NFL) while only allowing 344 (eighth fewest) and sending an NFL-best eight players to the Pro Bowl.\nPro Bowl quarterback Jalen Hurts led the offense, setting career highs in his third season in completion percentage (66.5%), passing yards (3,701), and passing touchdowns (22) while throwing just six interceptions, giving a career-high 101.5 passer rating, the fourth-best in the NFL. Hurts also rushed for 736 yards and 13 touchdowns, the second-highest total in the league among quarterbacks. Pro Bowl receiver A. J. Brown, acquired from the Tennessee Titans in the off-season, posted 1,496 receiving yards and eleven touchdowns, while second-year receiver DeVonta Smith added 1,196 yards and seven scores. Tight end Dallas Goedert was another reliable target with 702 yards and three touchdowns. Pro Bowl running back Miles Sanders ranked fifth in the NFL with 1,269 yards and eleven touchdowns, averaging 4.9 yards per carry. The team also sent three offensive linemen to the Pro Bowl: guard Landon Dickerson, tackle Lane Johnson, and center Jason Kelce. Kicker Jake Elliott made 20 of 23 field goals (87%), including 5-of-6 from at least 50 yards.\nPhiladelphia's defense ranked second in the league in yards allowed (5,125) and set an NFL record with four players who recorded at least ten sacks. The defensive line features defensive ends Josh Sweat and Brandon Graham, who each recorded 11 sacks, along with defensive tackles Fletcher Cox (seven sacks), Javon Hargrave (11 sacks), and Milton Williams (4 sacks). Pro Bowl linebacker Haason Reddick ranked second in the NFL with 16 sacks while forcing five fumbles and recovering three. Linebackers T. J. Edwards and Kyzir White each recorded over 100 combined tackles and broke up seven passes. In the secondary, safety C. J. Gardner-Johnson co-led the NFL with six interceptions, while All-Pro cornerbacks Darius Slay and James Bradberry each had three.\nIt was Philadelphia's fourth Super Bowl, following a win in Super Bowl LII and losses in Super Bowls XV and XXXIX. The Eagles also won three pre-Super Bowl NFL championships in 1948, 1949, and 1960.\nPlayoffs.\nThe Chiefs entered the playoffs as the  1 seed in the AFC. They defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars, 27–20, in the AFC Divisional round. In a tightly contested game, the Chiefs held off a late fourth-quarter rally by the Jaguars. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes went down early in the game with a high right ankle sprain injury which forced him out of the game for a drive, but he was able to return shortly after leaving. The AFC Championship pitted the Chiefs against the Cincinnati Bengals in a rematch of the 2021 AFC Championship game. This was the fifth consecutive AFC Championship hosted by the Chiefs, extending their record. Much like the previous year's contest, the game was close toward the end of the fourth quarter. On the game's last drive, tied at 20, Bengals defensive end Joseph Ossai was flagged for a late hit on Patrick Mahomes after he stepped out of bounds, which set the Chiefs up in field goal range with eight seconds remaining. Harrison Butker then kicked a 45-yard field goal to send the Chiefs to the Super Bowl with a 23–20 win.\nThe Eagles went into the playoffs as the  1 seed in the NFC. Their first playoff matchup was against their NFC East rival New York Giants. The Eagles quickly jumped to a 28–0 halftime lead and cruised to the NFC Championship game with a 38–7 victory, which marked the first playoff win for Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts and head coach Nick Sirianni. In the NFC Championship, the Eagles hosted the San Francisco 49ers. The Eagles won the NFC Championship, 31–7, as the 49ers lost their starting and backup quarterbacks to injury.\nPre-game notes.\nAs the designated home team in the Super Bowl's annual rotation between the two conferences, the Eagles chose to wear their green home jerseys with white pants. The Chiefs wore their white away jerseys with red pants.\nAs the designated home team, the Eagles practiced at the host team Arizona Cardinals' practice facility in Tempe, Arizona, the week leading up to the game. The Chiefs practiced at Arizona State University, also in Tempe.\nThe game was informally referred to as the \"Andy Reid Bowl\", as Chiefs head coach Andy Reid had previously served as the head coach of the Eagles from to . Reid became the fifth head coach to face his former team in the Super Bowl, joining Weeb Ewbank (Super Bowl III), Dan Reeves (XXXIII), Jon Gruden (XXXVII), and Pete Carroll (XLIX).\nThe game was also referred to as the \"Kelce Bowl\", as this marked the first Super Bowl to feature brothers playing against each other: Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and Eagles center Jason Kelce.\nThe game was the first Super Bowl between two black starting quarterbacks: Patrick Mahomes of the Chiefs and Jalen Hurts of the Eagles. Mahomes (27 years of age) and Hurts (24) were the youngest starting quarterback pair in Super Bowl history.\nBroadcasting.\nUnited States.\nTelevision.\nSuper Bowl LVII was televised by Fox. It marked the final game to be broadcast under the NFL television contract that began in 2014. Fox broadcast the game in Dolby Vision high-dynamic-range (HDR) color exclusively on Xfinity.\nThis was the first Super Bowl assignment for Fox's broadcast team of play-by-play announcer Kevin Burkhardt and color analyst Greg Olsen, who replaced Joe Buck and Troy Aikman after they departed for ABC/ESPN and \"Monday Night Football\". Erin Andrews and Tom Rinaldi reported from the sidelines, and Mike Pereira served as rules expert. Pregame, halftime, and postgame coverage were provided by the \"Fox NFL Sunday\" team, hosted by Curt Menefee and Terry Bradshaw along with analysts Howie Long, Michael Strahan, Jimmy Johnson, Rob Gronkowski and NFL insider Jay Glazer.\nFox Deportes televised the game in Spanish, with Adrian Garcia-Marquez on play-by-play and color analyst Alejandro Villanueva.\nFox aired the season two premiere of \"Next Level Chef\" as its lead-out program.\nAdvertising.\nFox charged between $6 and 7 million for a 30-second Super Bowl commercial. At least four cryptocurrency-related ads were planned, but their deals fell through after the bankruptcy of FTX in November 2022. One NFT ad aired during the game, which was a giveaway promoting the game \"Limit Break\". Anheuser-Busch purchased three total minutes for its Michelob Ultra, Bud Light, and Busch Light brands. Other advertisers included Heineken, Diageo, Rémy Martin, Molson Coors, Doritos, Google Pixel and M&amp;M's.\nPeacock aired a commercial for their series \"Poker Face\" created exclusively for the game, which referenced some of those commercials, all of which aired before it. Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Disney, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures, MGM and Amazon Studios also promoted their upcoming films and series during the game, with trailer premieres for \"The Flash\", \"Fast X\", \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\", \"Strays\", ', \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\", \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\", \"Scream VI\", ', \"\", \"65\", \"Creed III\" and \"Air\". A 15-second spot for Universal's \"Cocaine Bear\" aired during the pre-game show. Fox also aired a commercial for the season 9 premiere of \"The Masked Singer\" during the game. Disney also aired a commercial to kick off its \"100 Years of Wonder\" celebration in honor of the centennial anniversary of the founding of The Walt Disney Company. This commercial was called by many as the best of the night, with System1, a specialist in advertising effectiveness, naming it the \"most effective\" with a rating of 5.3 stars on their Test Your Ad platform.\nRatings.\nNielsen ratings initially reported an average of 113 million viewers, making it the third-highest-rated Super Bowl of all time. Viewership was strongest in the Kansas City market with a 52.0 share, although local viewership was down in comparison to the Chiefs' appearances at Super Bowl LIV (55.7) and LV (59.9). In May 2023, Nielsen revised its ratings data for Super Bowl LVII to account for technical issues that had created \"irregularities\" in the original ratings, increasing the average to 115.1 million. The game consequently overtook Super Bowl XLIX as the most-watched U.S. television program of all time (the Apollo 11 landing is considered to be the most-watched U.S. television broadcast of all time, as it was reported to have been seen by between 125 and 150 million viewers, but this was a news event carried over multiple networks).\nStreaming.\nThe game was available via streaming to mobile devices on NFL+ and free on the NFL app and NFL.com. This was the first Super Bowl since the league's own NFL+ took over mobile streaming rights from Verizon.\nRadio.\nWestwood One provided nationwide radio coverage of the game, which was simulcast by NFL Network as part of their \"Super Bowl GameCenter\" coverage, with play-by-play announcer Kevin Harlan, color analyst Kurt Warner, sideline reporters Laura Okmin and Mike Golic, and rules expert Gene Steratore. Scott Graham hosted the pregame, halftime, and postgame shows with Ryan Harris providing analysis.\nIn the immediate local markets of the two teams, 106.5 The Wolf carried the Chiefs call of the game with Mitch Holthaus, while WIP carried the Eagles call of the game with Merrill Reese. Both teams carried pre-game and post-game coverage, but did not syndicate the game itself on their terrestrial stations due to NFL rules requiring the Westwood One broadcast to air in all non-participating markets. The Chiefs radio broadcast, however, was available to stream worldwide on WDAF-FM's streaming platform Audacy on desktops and laptops with no blackouts. Both teams' radio broadcasts streamed on NFL+ on mobile devices in the USA and NFL Game Pass internationally.\nEntertainment.\nPregame.\nAmerican country singer Chris Stapleton sang the national anthem, actress Sheryl Lee Ralph performed \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\", and R&amp;B singer Babyface sang \"America the Beautiful\". All three songs were also interpreted in American Sign Language by actor and Arizona native Troy Kotsur, with \"America the Beautiful\" additionally interpreted in Plains Sign Talk by Collin Denny.\nFor the first time in Super Bowl history, the flyover was entirely crewed by women to celebrate the 50th anniversary of women flying in the US Navy. Four Navy aircraft taking off from Luke Air Force Base were used: a pair of F/A-18F Super Hornets from the Strike Fighter Squadron 122 \"Flying Eagles\", an F-35C Lightning II from the Strike Fighter Squadron 97 \"Warhawks\", and an EA-18G Growler from the Electronic Attack Squadron 129 \"Vikings\".\nFour Pat Tillman Foundation scholars then served as honorary captains during the coin toss ceremony, honoring the memory of Pat Tillman, the former Arizona Cardinals player turned US Army Ranger who was killed in 2004 while stationed in Afghanistan.\nHalftime.\nOn September 23, 2022, Apple Music was announced as the new naming rights sponsor of the Super Bowl halftime show, replacing Pepsi, which had sponsored the previous ten halftime shows. Barbadian singer Rihanna was announced as the headliner of the halftime show on September 25. It marked Rihanna's first live performance in over five years. In a red outfit, she sang portions of twelve of her songs including \"Where Have You Been\", \"Only Girl (In the World)\", and \"Work\". Justina Miles performed the halftime show in American Sign Language for the first time in Super Bowl History.\nGame summary.\nFirst half.\nAfter Kansas City won the coin toss and deferred their choice to the second half, Philadelphia began the game with the ball. Their first drive spanned 75 yards in 11 plays and featured two rushes by Jalen Hurts for 12 yards, and four completed passes—the longest of which was a 23-yard completion to DeVonta Smith. After the Eagles converted a third down from inside the Kansas City 5-yard line, Hurts scored the game's first points with a 1-yard touchdown run to take a 7–0 lead. Kansas City responded with an 8-play, 75-yard drive that featured a 24-yard run by Isiah Pacheco. Patrick Mahomes also completed two passes to Travis Kelce, including an 18-yard touchdown pass to tie the score. Philadelphia's second drive produced the game's first three-and-out after a pass interference penalty set them back early. Kansas City did not take advantage, as several incompletions set up a 42-yard field goal attempt by Harrison Butker, which hit the left upright and was no-good. The Eagles began their next drive from their 32-yard line and gained yardage on two Hurts rushes and two Hurts passes, in addition to a defensive offside penalty, before the first quarter ended.\nOn the first play of the second quarter, Philadelphia retook the lead 14–7 with a 45-yard touchdown pass from Hurts to A. J. Brown. The Chiefs did not recover from a loss of yardage on the first play of their next drive, and they punted as a result of their first three-and-out. After a Hurts pass and a Kenneth Gainwell rush each gained nine yards, Hurts fumbled the ball while running into linebacker Nick Bolton, who recovered it bouncing off the ground in stride and ran 36 yards for a touchdown, tying the game. Hurts led the Eagles on another touchdown drive to take the lead. The Eagles converted a pair of fourth downs, one of them a 4th and 5 with a 28-yard scramble by Hurts, and later by drawing the Chiefs offside on 4th down for the other. Hurts finished the 71-yard drive with a 4-yard touchdown run that made the score 21–14. The Chiefs started their next drive well after gaining a first down in two plays leading into the two-minute warning, ⁣⁣ but they stalled from there and punted with 1:33 remaining in the half. During this drive, Mahomes re-aggravated a high ankle sprain that he had suffered earlier in the playoffs and was seen limping to the side-line after the play. However, unlike the Divisional round game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Chiefs did not play any further offensive snaps without him. Britain Covey returned the ensuing punt 27 yards to his own 43-yard line, which, in addition to a 22-yard pass from Hurts to Brown near the end of the Eagles' next drive, helped put them into field goal range. However, Chiefs rookie Trent McDuffie then made a crucial tackle on Kenneth Gainwell to keep him in-bounds after a two-yard pass from Hurts, preventing the Eagles from having any chance at throwing to the end-zone before half-time. The Eagles used their final timeout to stop the clock, and Jake Elliott converted the ensuing 35-yard kick to increase Philadelphia's lead to ten points going into halftime.\nSecond half.\nKansas City received the ball to begin the second half and drove 75 yards in 12 plays, with Mahomes completing all three of his passes for 26 yards and rushing for 14 before Pacheco's 1-yard touchdown run cut their deficit to three points. Philadelphia responded with a 19-play, 65-yard drive, in which Hurts completed two 17-yard passes to tight end Dallas Goedert, one of which converted a third-and-14. On the first play of the drive, Hurts appeared to complete a pass to running back Miles Sanders before cornerback L'Jarius Sneed forced a fumble on Sanders, which was recovered and returned for a touchdown again by Bolton, this time from 24 yards. However, the ruling was overturned after the replay review determined that Sanders did not have full possession of the ball, taking the touchdown off the board and allowing Philadelphia to continue their drive. At this point, however, the Kansas City defense started to have more success against the Eagles offense, and although the Eagles managed to succeed on a fourth-and-1 attempt, a subsequent third-and-11 try was stopped at the Chiefs' 15-yard line, forcing the Eagles to settle for a 33-yard field goal attempt, which Elliott converted with 1:48 left in the third quarter, making the score 27–21. The Chiefs gained 31 yards on their next four plays, including two Pacheco rushes that reached the Philadelphia 44-yard line, which led them to end the third quarter.\nMahomes completed four passes to JuJu Smith-Schuster for a total of 38 yards after the quarter break and concluded the Chiefs' 12-play, 75-yard drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Kadarius Toney, giving the Chiefs their first lead of the game, 28–27. The Chiefs' defense continued their good form by forcing Philadelphia to their first, and only, three-and-out of the second half. The ensuing Arryn Siposs punt, however, was a poor one and allowed Kadarius Toney to return it for 65 yards to the Eagles' 5-yard line and setting a record with the longest punt return in Super Bowl history, surpassing Jordan Norwood’s record of a 61-yard return seven years earlier in Super Bowl 50. Kansas City scored quickly on a 4-yard pass from Mahomes to Skyy Moore in an almost carbon-copy play of the previous Toney touchdown. Butker's extra point increased their lead to eight points. Philadelphia took four minutes off the clock on their ensuing drive, which spanned eight plays and resulted in a 45-yard pass to Smith that set up Hurts' 2-yard touchdown run on the next play. Hurts then scored a two-point conversion with a run that tied the score at 35 with 5:15 remaining. At the start of Kansas City's next drive, three runs by Pacheco for 15 yards and two completions by Mahomes for 17 yards moved the ball to the Eagles' 43-yard line. On the next play, despite his re-aggravated ankle injury, Mahomes took off for a 26-yard run — the longest run by any Chiefs player in the game — that gave the Chiefs a first down on Philadelphia's 17-yard line. A 2-yard run by Pacheco ran the clock down to the two-minute warning. A completed pass for no gain brought up third-and-8. Mahomes threw an incomplete pass on the next play, but Kansas City earned a first down after James Bradberry was penalized for holding — a call that was criticized by some, but was supported by others, including by Bradberry himself who would admit after the game that he did hold Smith-Schuster, and was hoping that the officials would not call it. On the next play, with first down at the Eagles' 11-yard line, McKinnon rushed to the 2-yard line where he intentionally downed himself, thereby extending the Chiefs' drive taking more time off the clock. The Chiefs ended the drive by taking a knee twice and kicking a 27-yard field goal, leaving eight seconds on the clock. A Hail Mary pass by Hurts fell incomplete after he partially lost his footing, ending the game.\nMahomes completed 21 of his 27 pass attempts for 182 yards and three touchdowns and was named the Super Bowl MVP. He also ran for 44 yards. Pacheco was the top rusher of the game with 15 carries for 76 yards and a touchdown. Bolton had eight solo tackles, one assist, and a fumble return touchdown. Hurts finished the day 27/38 for 304 yards and a touchdown while rushing 15 times for 70 yards and three touchdowns. He set the Super Bowl record for rushing yards and rushing touchdowns by a quarterback while tying the Super Bowl record for rushing touchdowns and points scored (20) as well. Smith was his top target with seven receptions, and led all receivers in the game with 100 yards, while Brown had six catches for 96 yards and a score.\nThe Chiefs' offensive line was heavily praised for their performance in the game. Philadelphia led the NFL with 70 sacks during the season, just two short of the league record. However, in the Super Bowl, Mahomes was not sacked at all, only the second time the Eagles had no sacks in their regular season or playoff games, while Kansas City's offense rushed for 158 yards.\nFinal statistics.\nIndividual statistics.\nCompletions/attempts&lt;br&gt;Carries&lt;br&gt;Long gain&lt;br&gt;Receptions&lt;br&gt;Times targeted\nOfficials.\nSuper Bowl LVII featured seven officials, a replay official, a replay assistant, and eight alternate officials. The numbers in parentheses below indicate their uniform numbers.\nAftermath.\nThe Chiefs successfully defended their Super Bowl title by winning Super Bowl LVIII the following season over the San Francisco 49ers, becoming the first team to repeat as Super Bowl champions since the 2003 and 2004 New England Patriots. The Super Bowl LVIII win, being the Chiefs' third Super Bowl win and fourth Super Bowl appearance in five seasons, led many sports commentators to establish the team as a dynasty.\nThe Eagles started the following season with a 10–1 record, the best in the league. However, the Eagles faltered down the stretch, losing five of their last six games and falling to second place in the NFC East behind the Dallas Cowboys, and the 5-seed in the NFC. They were subsequently blown out by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the Wild Card round. Their late-season collapse is considered by many to be one of the worst in NFL history. The Eagles promptly fired offensive coordinator Brian Johnson and defensive coordinator Sean Desai within a week of their playoff exit."

        "title": "Super Bowl XXVII halftime show",
        "text": "The Super Bowl XXVII halftime show took place on January 31, 1993, at the Rose Bowl, Pasadena, California, as part of Super Bowl XXVII.\nIn an effort to increase its profile after being counterprogrammed by an \"In Living Color\" special the previous year, the show featured a performance by Michael Jackson. The performance was successful in its goals, causing viewership of the Super Bowl to increase between halves for the first time in the game's history. With a audience of 133.4 million viewers it's one of the most watched television broadcasts of all time . The show, along with other notable appearances by Jackson in late January and February, also helped improve sales of his then current album \"Dangerous\". \nRetrospectively, the show has been credited with establishing the norms of future Super Bowl halftime shows (with a greater focus on major names in popular music), and ranked as being among the greatest Super Bowl halftime shows of all time.\nBackground.\nPrior to Super Bowl XXVII, the game's halftime show often featured performances by marching bands, and later drill teams and ensembles such as Up with People—acts that, by the 1990s, were considered to be culturally outdated. The previous year's halftime show had featured a salute to the 1992 Winter Olympics, with figure skating performances by Brian Boitano and Dorothy Hamill, and musical guest Gloria Estefan. Future NFL broadcaster Fox famously aired a special episode of its sketch comedy series \"In Living Color\" against the halftime period, which caused viewership of the game on CBS to decrease by 22%.\nIn the wake of the incident, the NFL began the process of heightening the profile of the halftime show in an effort to attract and retain mainstream viewers. Radio City Productions, who would produce the halftime show, attempted to court Michael Jackson by meeting with him and his manager Sandy Gallin. After three failed negotiations, including asking the NFL for a fee of $1 million, Jackson's management agreed to allow him to perform at Super Bowl XXVII.\nAlthough the league does not pay appearance fees for Super Bowl halftime performers, the NFL and Frito-Lay agreed to make a donation of $100,000 to Jackson's Heal the World Foundation, and provide commercial time during the game for the foundation's Heal L.A. campaign, which aimed to provide health care, drug education, and mentorship for Los Angeles youth in the aftermath of the 1992 Los Angeles riots.\nMore than 250 volunteers were required in order to erect and disassemble the show's 10-ton stage. The stage was on all-terrain tires in order to limit damage to the playing surface.\nPerformance.\nThe performance began with a James Earl Jones' voice introducing an, \"unprecedented Super Bowl spectacular starring Michael Jackson\". Michael Jackson then seemed to appear at the top of the stadium's two jumbotrons (using body doubles). Michael then catapults from center stage and stood completely frozen and silent for almost two minutes before his long-time guitarist Jennifer Batten began the performance. Jackson's performance included a medley consisting of \"Jam\" (with the beginning of \"Why You Wanna Trip On Me\"), \"Billie Jean\" and \"Black or White\" (includes beginning of \"Another Part of Me\") including the ending of Batten's guitar solo. The finale featured an audience card stunt, a video montage showing Jackson participating in various humanitarian efforts around the world, and a choir of over 3,000 local Los Angeles area children singing \"We Are the World\", later joining Jackson as he sang his single \"Heal the World\" with an inflatable globe.

        "text": "The women's 1500 metres speed skating competition of the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Gangneung Oval in Gangneung on 12 February 2018.\nDutch skater Ireen Wüst, gold medalist at the previous Winter Olympics in this discipline, won the gold medal, Miho Takagi from Japan won the silver medal and Marrit Leenstra from the Netherlands won bronze, only 0.01 seconds ahead of her fellow countrywoman Lotte van Beek. On winning the gold medal Wüst became the first athlete to win gold medals at four consecutive Winter Olympics, exactly twelve years after her first Olympic medal in the 3000 metres in 2006, and with a total of ten medals, including five golds, Wüst takes the seventh position in the list of best Winter Olympic athlete ever. Wüst also became the most decorated Olympic skater in terms of the total number of medals. For Japan's Miho Takagi, it was her first Olympic medal.\nIn the victory ceremony, the medals were presented by Hayley Wickenheiser, member of the International Olympic Committee accompanied by Patricia St. Peter, ISU council member.\nSummary.\nThe race started at 21.30 local time. Wüst was the first of the medal candidates to set a time. She began with a false start, then at the first cross she had to slow down a little because her competitor Brianne Tutt was riding in front of her. In the first 1.5 laps she was slower compared to the previous fastest time of the American Brittany Bowe. After a quick second lap, she was faster and finished with a time of 1:54.35. Marrit Leenstra of the Netherlands, often fourth in big tournaments, was the first to challenge the time set by Wüst. The Dutch record holder, who trains with the Italian team, was at 1100 meters still below the time of Wüst, but slowed down in the final round and set a time of 1:55.26.\nLotte van Beek of the Netherlands, who won bronze in 2014 in this discipline, had a good start but with an overall time of 1:55.27 she finished just 0.01 behind Leenstra, eventually earning fourth place. \nIn the last race there were two main favourites, Miho Takagi from Japan who had won all races she started in this discipline in the current season, and American Heather Bergsma-Richardson, the world record holder who had won gold at the 2017 World Single Distances Championships at the Gangneung Oval. They began with a false start, then they went very fast with good intermediate times through to the end. Finally Takagi could not beat the time of Wüst and won silver in a time of 1:54.55.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world, Olympic and track records were as follows.\nResults.\nThe race was held at 21:30."

        "title": "2018 Rafael Nadal tennis season",
        "text": "The 2018 Rafael Nadal tennis season officially began on 15 January 2018, with the start of the Australian Open, and ended on 8 September 2018, with a loss at the semifinals of the US Open and subsequent injury.\nThe season was largely shortened by the hip, knee, abdominal and ankle injuries Nadal suffered during the year. He played only nine tournaments, his lowest since 2002 (which was his first year on the ATP tour). However, the season still saw Nadal win five titles including a record extending 11th title at the French Open, and have his highest winning percentage of a single season at 91.83%.\nYear summary.\nEarly hard court season.\nExhibition matches.\nAs of in his 2017 season, Nadal's schedule before the Australian Open included the World Tennis Championship, in Abu Dhabi, the Brisbane International and the Fast4 Showdown, in Sydney. However, he pulled out of all three events due to a knee injury. His season started in Melbourne with a match against Richard Gasquet, included in the Kooyong Classic exhibition tournament, which he lost in straight sets. On the day after, Nadal moved on to play the , another exhibition tournament where only tie-break matches are played. He defeated Lucas Pouille in the quarterfinals and Lleyton Hewitt in the semifinals, before losing in the final against Tomáš Berdych. Nadal closed his Australian Open preparation with another exhibition match against Dominic Thiem in the Margaret Court Arena, which he won in a third-set match tiebreaker.\nAustralian Open.\nIn the first major tournament of the year, the Australian Open, Nadal was the top seed, knowing that he would need to reach the quarterfinals in order to secure the No. 1 position in the ATP rankings. Despite playing his first official match in more than two months, Nadal easily defeated Víctor Estrella Burgos in straight sets. Following strong performances in straight sets victories against Leonardo Mayer and Damir Džumhur, he defeated Diego Schwartzman in the fourth round, reaching the quarterfinals and thus retaining the world No. 1 status. In the quarterfinals he faced World No. 6 Marin Čilić, and despite leading two sets to one, he eventually had to retire after going down a break in the fifth set due to a hip injury.\nMexican Open.\nHaving been relegated to No. 2 in the ATP rankings a week before, Nadal was set to play at the Mexican Open. However, he was forced to again pull out of the tournament due to the hip injury sustained at the Australian Open that was aggravated in a practice session. On 2 March 2018, through his Facebook account, Nadal announced the withdrawal from the season's first two Masters 1000 tournaments: the Indian Wells Masters and the Miami Open. Despite his absence, Nadal regained the world No. 1 position on 2 April 2018, due to Roger Federer losing in the second round of the Miami Open.\nSpring clay court season.\nDavis Cup World Group quarterfinals.\nAs announced on 27 March 2018 by the Spain Davis Cup team captain Sergi Bruguera, Nadal represented his country participating in the Davis Cup World Group quarterfinal tie against Germany, in Valencia. These were Nadal's first matches since his Australian Open defeat, more than two months later. Nadal won both his singles rubbers, against Philipp Kohlschreiber and Alexander Zverev, in straight sets, to help Spain advancing to the semifinals.\nMonte-Carlo Masters.\nAt the Monte-Carlo Masters, Nadal successfully defended his title by winning an unprecedented 11th title in Monte-Carlo, reaching the finals without dropping a set and not losing more than 4 games in each set that he played against Aljaž Bedene, Karen Khachanov, Dominic Thiem and Grigor Dimitrov. In the final, he halted former top 4 player Kei Nishikori's resurgence by beating him in straight sets, extending his clay winning streak to 36 sets in a row. Additionally, none of his opponents were able to win more than 4 games in each of those 36 sets. This tournament victory marked the Spaniard's 31st Masters 1000 title, putting him yet again at the top of most Masters 1000 titles won, passing rival Novak Djokovic who stands at 30. His 36 straight sets won on clay also became a record, surpassing both Ilie Nastase and Guillermo Coria, who won 34 and 35 straight sets respectively and are the only players to win 30 or more consecutive sets on clay other than Nadal. In that process, he also retained his World No. 1 ranking for another week.\nBarcelona Open.\nComing to Barcelona, Nadal again required to defend his title at the Barcelona Open if he were to retain his no.1 ranking, which he did in pure dominance. He extended his record of straight sets won on clay to 46 consecutive sets, with Martin Klizan, Nadal's quarterfinal opponent becoming the first man to take more than 4 games off in a single set against Nadal since Dominic Thiem beat him at last year's Rome Masters. Nadal's semifinal win against David Goffin was his 400th match won on clay, making him the only player, of either gender, to win at least 400 matches in both clay and hard courts. In the final, he defeated Greek rising star Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets with the loss of only 3 games, despite the Greek having not lost a single set in the tournament. This victory was his 11th Barcelona Open title and his 77th overall. The win marked his 20th ATP 500 series title, which put him back atop the list of most ATP 500 titles, tied with Roger Federer. Additionally, it marked his 14th consecutive season in which he won at least 1 ATP 500 title.\nMadrid Open.\nFresh after achieving the 'Undecima' of Monte Carlo and Barcelona titles, Nadal had to defend yet another title at Madrid if he were to retain his No. 1 ranking, with the tournament taking place on his home soil. He reached the quarterfinals, defeating Gael Monfils and Diego Schwartzman in straight sets, to extend his record to 50 consecutive sets on clay starting from 2017 French Open. His win over Schwartzman broke John McEnroe's record of 49 straight sets won on a single surface. McEnroe had previously achieved the record on carpet in 1984. In a surprise, Nadal lost in straight sets to Dominic Thiem in quarterfinals, ending his 21-match and record 50-set winning streak on clay. He also relinquished his world no. 1 ranking to Federer in the process.\nItalian Open.\nNadal next participated at the Italian Open with a chance to regain his No.1 ranking if he were to win the tournament, which he did convincingly. He started off fresh and dominant, dispatching both Damir Džumhur and Canadian #NextGen Denis Shapovalov in just the loss of 6 games. He reached the semifinals by mounting a comeback against home-favourite Fabio Fognini after losing the first set. In the semifinals, he faced his resurging arch-rival Novak Djokovic for the 51st time, beating him in two sets after a tight first set tiebreak. This victory was his 356th match win in Masters 1000 level, thus surpassing Roger Federer for most matches won in the category. He faced in form German Alexander Zverev in the finals who was riding on a 13-match winning streak after reaching his 3rd tournament final in as many weeks, winning the previous two. After easily winning the first set, Zverev won the second set and was up a break in the third set before a rain delay interrupted the match. However, after the delay, Nadal would go on to win 5 straight games to seal the victory. This was his 8th Italian Open title and overall record-extending 32nd Masters 1000 title. It is also his 78th career title, making him the 4th most title holder in the Open Era, passing John McEnroe whom he was tied with before this tournament. He became world no. 1 again after relinquishing it for only one week.\nFrench Open.\nNadal needed to win the French Open to retain his World No. 1 ranking. He began the tournament by defeating Simone Bolelli, Guido Pella, Richard Gasquet, and Maximilian Marterer all without losing a set en route to the quarterfinals. His opponent in the QF, clay-court specialist Diego Schwartzman, took the first set and became the first person to win a set against Nadal in the tournament since Djokovic defeated Nadal in straight sets in the 2015 French Open, thus ending Nadal's 37 sets win streak at the French Open. Nadal won the next three sets and continued his form by defeating Juan Martín del Potro in the semifinals in straight sets. In the final, he met Dominic Thiem, the only man to beat Nadal on clay in 2017 and 2018. Nadal dispatched the Austrian in three sets, never losing more than 4 games in a set, to win his record-extending 11th French Open title, equalling the record for most titles won in a single major by either men or women held by Margaret Court with her 11 titles in the Australian Open. His win was also his 17th major singles title, which is 2nd on the men’s Open Era list behind only Roger Federer.\nGrass court season.\nExhibition matches.\nNadal's schedule for 2018 included the Queen's Club Championships, but in the week before he chose to withdraw from the tournament to be able to recover after the clay court season. He chose to participate in the Hurlingham Tennis Classic, an exhibition tournament played from 26 to 29 June at the Hurlingham Club, in London, to get some preparation for the following week's Wimbledon Championships. He first played Matthew Ebden, winning the match in two tight sets, and on the tournament's last day he played Lucas Pouille – this time losing in straight sets.\nWimbledon.\nDespite being ranked ATP No. 1 coming to Wimbledon, Nadal was seeded 2nd according to their special formula (behind defending champion Roger Federer). He successfully replicated his previous result of reaching the 4th round by defeating Dudi Sela, Mikhail Kukushkin, and rising-star Alex de Minaur all in straight sets, guaranteeing himself the No. 1 ranking after Wimbledon. Nadal booked his first quarterfinal spot since reaching the Wimbledon final in 2011 by beating Jiří Veselý in straight sets. He proceeded towards the semis after outlasting Juan Martín del Potro in a five-set thriller which lasted nearly 5 hours. In the semifinals, he suffered a heart-breaking five set loss to Djokovic after squandering three set points in the third set, that would have put him at a 2-1 set lead after that set, with the match lasting two days due to Wimbledon's 11pm curfew. However, a semifinal at Wimbledon indicated his best performances here since 2011. This semifinal match was the second longest ever, the longest was Kevin Anderson vs John Isner which the two had played before the Nadal-Djokovic match earlier on that day.\nNorth American hard court season.\nCanadian Open.\nNadal opened his hard court season campaign by beating Benoît Paire in straight sets. In the round of 16, he beat resurging former World No. 3 Stan Wawrinka in straight sets, and followed this with a comeback victory against World No. 7 Marin Cilic, whom he lost to after retiring in the Australian Open, in the quarterfinals. He remained solid and defeated in-form NextGen player Karen Khachanov in straight sets to reach his first hard court final of the year. Nadal faced off against Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final and won in straight sets, winning his 4th Rogers Cup title and extending his record Masters 1000 titles to 33 titles. It was his first victory at a hard court Masters 1000 tournament since 2013 Western &amp; Southern Open. He also became the 4th male player to win 80 career singles titles.\nUS Open.\nHaving not played since his victory in Canada due to withdrawing from Cincinnati, Nadal was seeded No.1 at the US Open, where he was the defending champion. In the first round, Nadal faced compatriot David Ferrer, who was playing in his last grand tournament. In the last grand slam match of his career, Ferrer retired with a foot injury in second set. In the second round, Nadal faced Canadian Vasek Pospisil, who he defeated easily in straight sets. In the third round, Nadal faced Russian Karen Khachanov, who pushed Nadal hard before he managed to win in four tight sets. His next opponent was Georgian Nikoloz Basilashvili, whom he defeated in four sets. This marked the first year since 2011 that Nadal had reached the QF of all four majors. In his quarterfinal match, Nadal faced World No. 9 Dominic Thiem, whom he defeated earlier in the year in the French Open final. In an epic match, Nadal managed to seal the victory in the fifth set tiebreak, after having lost the first set 0-6. Nadal went on to then face Juan Martin del Potro, in a rematch of the previous year's semifinal which Nadal had won in four sets. However, Nadal retired after going down two sets to love due to a right knee injury. On 19 September, Nadal withdrew from the Asian tournaments at Beijing and Shanghai to fully recover from the injury.\nEuropean indoor hard court season.\nParis Masters.\nNadal was scheduled to return from knee injury hiatus in the Paris Masters, but withdrew from an abdominal injury suffered during a training session. In that process, he also lost his world No. 1 ranking to Novak Djokovic.\nATP Tour Finals.\nOn November 5, Nadal announced his withdrawal from the ATP Finals due to the abdominal injury, and also citing an ankle injury on which he decided to undergo surgery. This marked the end of his 2018 season, having not played since retiring in the semifinals of the US Open.\nAll matches.\nThis table chronicles all the matches of Rafael Nadal in 2018, including walkovers (W/O) which the ATP does not count as wins.\nSingles matches.\n \nSchedule.\nPer Rafael Nadal, this is his current 2018 schedule (subject to change).\nYearly records.\nHead-to-head matchups.\nRafael Nadal had a ATP match win–loss record in the 2018 season.

        "text": "Jordan Bernard Murphy (born February 28, 1997) is a Puerto Rican-Virgin Islander professional basketball player for the Leones de Ponce of the Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN). He played college basketball for the Minnesota Golden Gophers. He is the all-time Golden Gopher career rebound and career double-double leader. He ranks second in Big Ten Conference history (to Jerry Lucas) in career rebounds. Following his college career he has had multiple stints with teams in the NBA G League and multiple stints with the Leones de Ponce of the Baloncesto Superior Nacional.\nHigh school career.\nMurphy led his middle school to a 75-0 record. There was preseason speculation that he might start as a freshman who was at least for Central Catholic Marianist High School in November 2011. However, that December he came off the bench. As a senior, he helped William J. Brennan High School post a 31–3 record by averaging 23.6 points, 10.5 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.9 steals per game and earned Class 6A All-state recognition as a senior from the Texas Association of Basketball Coaches. Murphy committed to play for VCU on November 13, 2014. When VCU head coach Shaka Smart left VCU to coach Texas the following April, Murphy asked his successor Will Wade to be released from his commitment. Wade granted the release. At the time, Murphy already had interest from Oregon, UCLA, Gonzaga, and Miami. Minnesota invited him for a visit on May 11, after which he signed with Minnesota that Friday.\nCollege career.\nFreshman year.\nAs a freshman for the 2015–16 team, Murphy was twice named Big Ten Conference Freshman of the week. His 24-point/10-rebound November 30, 2015, double-double against Clemson and his 19-point/17-rebound December 5 double-double against South Dakota were the first back-to-back double-doubles by a Minnesota freshman since Kris Humphries for the 2003–04 Gophers, which earned his first Big Ten Conference Freshman of the week on December 7. No Minnesota freshman had even posted a single double-double since Humphries and the 24 points was the highest total by a Minnesota freshman since Andre Hollins of the 2011–12 Gophers. The December 5 game included a Murphy tip in with one second remaining to send the game to overtime. On February 18, Murphy posted 18 points, 6 rebounds and 6 assists against number six ranked Maryland, helping 0–13 Minnesota earn its first conference win and earning his second Big Ten Conference Freshman of the week honor on February 22. Following the 2015–16 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season, he was named to the All-Freshman Big Ten team along with Thomas Bryant, Diamond Stone, Ethan Happ and Caleb Swanigan.\nSophomore year.\nAs a sophomore, Murphy was Co-Big Ten Player of the Week (along with Derrick Walton) on February 13, 2017, following a 25-point/19-rebound/4-block double overtime performance against Iowa on February 8 and a 17-point/11-rebound effort on February 11 against Rutgers. After the 2016–17 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season, he was an All-Big Ten Conference third team selection by the Big Ten coaches and media.

        "title": "Equestrian statue of William III, London",
        "text": "The equestrian statue of William III by John Bacon Junior stands in St James's Square in central London. It is modelled on an earlier statue of the king by John Michael Rysbrack in Queen Square, Bristol. Funding for the London statue was provided in the will of Samuel Travers, M.P., dated 1724, but nothing was done to progress the plan for a further seventy years. A design for the monument was drawn up in 1794 by Bacon's father, John Bacon Senior, but this was not executed and the commission passed to Bacon Jr., under whose direction the statue was finally erected in 1808. The statue is a Grade I listed structure.\nHistory.\nWilliam III, Prince of Orange, ascended the English throne in 1688 following the overthrow of James II in the Glorious Revolution. William ruled jointly with his wife, Mary, James's daughter, until her death in 1694, and then solely until his own death in 1702. In 1697 the first proposal had been made to erect a statue in the king's honour in St James's Square, home to many of his strongest supporters. Nothing was done, however, and two further attempts to revive the plan, in 1710 and 1721, also failed. In 1724, a member of Parliament and Crown official, Samuel Travers, left a bequest in his will to fund the construction \"in St. James's Square or on Cheapside Conduit an equestrian statue in brass to the glorious memory of my master William the Third\". Nevertheless, it was a further seventy years before the commission to design the statue was granted to John Bacon Sr., then England's most notable sculptor, in 1794. Bacon Sr. died before the commission could be executed, and the final design and construction was undertaken in 1808 by his son, John Bacon Jr. The statue was originally sited in the middle of an octagonal pool, but this was drained in the 19th century.\nDescription.\nThe sculpture is in bronze and depicts William in the style of a Roman general. It is heavily influenced by the earlier equestrian statue of William undertaken by Rysbrack and erected in Bristol in 1736. The king is depicted astride a \"spirited\" horse and, despite his Classical style of dress, William's hairstyle follows late 17th century fashion. Jo Darke, in her history of English and Welsh monuments, suggests that the base of the statue includes a depiction of the molehill, over which William's horse Sorrel stumbled at Hampton Court, leading to the king's death from complications of pneumonia. Panels on either side of the plinth carry inscriptions in bronze lettering, the first reading and the second .\nThe statue was designated a Grade I listed structure, the highest grading given to buildings and structures of \"exceptional interest\", in 1958."

        "text": "Men's ice hockey tournaments have been staged at the Olympic Games since 1920. The men's tournament was introduced at the 1920 Summer Olympics, and permanently added to the Winter Olympic Games in 1924. Slovakia has participated in 5 of 22 tournaments, sending 10 goaltenders and 61 skaters.\nThe Olympic Games were originally intended for amateur athletes, so the players of the National Hockey League (NHL) and other professional leagues were not allowed to compete. In 1986, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games, starting in 1988. The NHL decided not to allow all players to participate in 1988, 1992 or 1994, because doing so would force the league to halt play during the Olympics. An agreement was reached in 1995 that allowed NHL players to compete in the Olympics, starting with the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan. Slovak players were a part of the Czechoslovakia men's national ice hockey team until the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993 separated the countries. The Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team was considered the successor to Czechoslovakia, while Slovakia was treated as a \"new\" country for the purposes of the International Ice Hockey Federation, and forced to work its way up through the ranks. Despite this, Slovakia qualified for the 1994 tournament, and finished in a respectable sixth place. At the 2002 tournament, the preliminary round was scheduled without the participation of NHL players. This negatively impacted the Slovakian team, which had a heavy reliance on NHL players; as a result, the team finished in 13th place in the tournament. Today, however, Slovakia is considered one of the \"Big Seven\" hockey nations, and is a regular contender for a medal at international tournaments. National teams are co-ordinated by Slovak Ice Hockey Federation and players are chosen by the team's management staff.\nThe Slovaks have not won a medal in an Olympic tournament. Their best finish was in fourth place at the 2010 Games. Peter Šťastný is the only Slovak player to have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame and the IIHF Hall of Fame. Miroslav Šatan holds the record for most games played, having dressed for 22 games in 1994, 2002, 2006 and 2010; he and Ľubomír Višňovský are the only players to participate in four tournaments. Marián Hossa leads Slovak Olympians in goals (12) and points (25), while Pavol Demitra has 14 assists, more than any other player.\nGoaltenders.\nReserve goaltenders.\nThese goaltenders were named to the Olympic roster, but did not receive any ice time during games. Pavol Rybár did not play in any games in the 1998 tournament, but did start games at later tournaments. Peter Budaj and Rastislav Staňa were named to the team at the 2010 tournament, but did not play any games."

Affected by the middle ear disorder which had impeded her season, she had a mediocre second run, but a strong slide brought her back to second, and only two hundredths of a second off gold after the third run. In the fourth run, she established a significant new track record, thereby becoming the first double Olympic champion (male or female) in the history of skeleton, and the first multiple woman medalist. Jacqueline Lölling was consistent throughout the event to come second, and Laura Deas came in third. For both of them, these were the first Olympic medals. \nJanine Flock, leading after three runs despite never being better than third in any single run, and placed under pressure by Yarnold's hot final run, had a mediocre last run, which took her out of the podium entirely.\nSimidele Adeagbo was the first athlete representing Nigeria at the Winter Olympics.\nQualification.\n20 athletes qualified.

        "text": "The Netherlands competed at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, between 9 and 25 February 2018. Speed skater Jan Smeekens was appointed as flag bearer for the opening ceremony, which was attended by King Willem Alexander, Queen Máxima and Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who also observed the sporting events that featured Dutch competitors.\nThe goal for the Dutch team was to win fifteen medals, as declared by Chef de mission Jeroen Bijl; they exceeded this goal by five medals, with a total of twenty, which placed the Netherlands fifth in the medal table. Most notably, the Dutch team dominated the individual speed skating events, winning seven of the ten gold medals awarded; they also won four medals in short track speed skating including their first ever gold medal in this discipline, won by Suzanne Schulting.\nHighlights.\nDay 1.\nNetherlands made a podium sweep in the women's 3000 metres speed skating event – Carlijn Achtereekte won gold, Ireen Wüst won silver and Antoinette de Jong won bronze. Then a few minutes after the podium sweep, Sjinkie Knegt won the silver medal in the men's 1500 metres short track speed skating event.\nDay 2.\nSven Kramer won the gold medal in the men's 5000 metres speed skating event. Kramer became the first man ever to win a gold medal in the same speed skating event at three consecutive Winter Olympics.\nDay 3.\nNetherlands took three of the top four places in the women's 1500 metres speed skating event; Ireen Wüst won the gold medal and Marrit Leenstra took bronze, only 0.01 seconds ahead of Lotte van Beek. On winning the gold medal, Wüst had succeeded in achieving gold medal wins at four consecutive Winter Olympics, exactly twelve years after winning her first gold medal in the 3000 metres in 2006. With a total of ten medals, including five golds, Wüst became the best ever Olympic speed skater (male or female) and the seventh-best Winter Olympic athlete overall.\nDay 4.\nOlympic debutant Kjeld Nuis won the gold medal in the men's 1500 metres speed skating event. Patrick Roest, also an Olympic debutant, won the silver medal. Koen Verweij, one of the favorites for the win, disappointed with an eleventh place. In short track speed skating, Yara van Kerkhof unexpectedly won the silver medal in the women's 500 metres event, benefiting from the disqualification of the Korean Choi Min-jeong after initially finishing in third.\nCompetitors.\nThe following is the list of number of competitors participating at the Games per sport/discipline.\n Niek van der Velden was the only male snowboarder on the team, but did not compete due to a broken shoulder.&lt;br&gt;\n Jorien ter Mors competed in both short track and long track speed skating (hence the totals appear to be one short).\nShort track speed skating.\nAccording to the ISU Special Olympic Qualification Rankings, the Netherlands have qualified a full squad of five men and five women each.\n Dylan Hoogerwerf was also part of the relay team, but did not compete.\n Rianne de Vries was also part of the relay team, but did not compete.\nSkeleton.\nBased on the world rankings, the Netherlands qualified two sleds. However, they elected to nominate only one athlete, Kimberley Bos, who was the first Dutch skeleton athlete ever to qualify for the Olympics. Although Bos met the international qualification criteria by virtue of her performance during the World Cup skeleton 2017–18, in which she finished in 13th place overall, she was not initially selected because she did not meet the NOC*NSF's own requirement (a top-12 place). However, NOC*NSF argued that Russian athlete Jelena Nikitina should be eliminated from the World Cup classification, as she had been excluded by the IOC from participating in the Olympics. When this was agreed, Bos rose to 12th place on the clean list for the World Cup classification, thereby fulfilling the NOC*NSF requirement, and her nomination was secured.\nSnowboarding.\nNiek van der Velden was unable to compete because of a broken shoulder caused by a crash in the final training for the slopestyle.\nCheryl Maas fell in both runs of the women's slopestyle, so she did not play an important role in the final. Strong winds during the final caused many of the athletes to fall; Maas called the conditions \"irresponsible\".\nSpeed skating.\nThe Dutch Olympic Committee selected the maximum allowed delegation of ten men and ten women, largely based on the results of the Olympic qualification tournament, held in December 2017. Kai Verbij was added for the 1000 metre event, because he was injured during the qualification race."

        "text": "Singapore sent a delegation to compete at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, from 9 to 25 February 2018. This marked the debut for Singapore at the Winter Olympics. The country was represented by single competitor, speed skater Cheyenne Goh. She did not advance out of the qualifying round of her event, the women's 1500 metres race.\nBackground.\nSingapore, then a British colony, first joined Olympic competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics, and have participated in every Summer Olympic Games since, except 1964, where Singaporean athletes competed as part of the Malaysian team, and the boycotted 1980 Summer Olympics. This was Singapore's debut appearance at a Winter Olympic Games. The only athlete Singapore qualified was Cheyenne Goh, a short-track speed skater. A former Olympian in table tennis for Singapore in the 2004 Summer Olympics, Tan Paey Fern, was named as the chef de mission of the team. Goh was chosen as the flag bearer for the parade of nations during the opening ceremony, while a volunteer from the PyeongChang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic &amp; Paralympic Winter Games carried the Singaporean flag for the closing ceremony. On carrying the flag, Goh said \"I'm really excited and it's a pretty big honour to be able to be doing this, I think it's really cool,\"\nShort track speed skating.\nOn 23 November it was announced by the International Skating Union (ISU) that Singapore had received a qualifying place for the women's 1500 m speed skating competition. Goh, who was 18 years old at the time of the Peyongchang Olympics, put her studies on hold to pursue competing in the Olympics. She was born in Singapore, but has lived in Canada since the age of four. The women's 1500 metres race took place on 17 February. Goh finished fifth in her heat with a time of 2 minutes and 36.9 seconds, and failed to advance to the semi-finals."

Charlotte Kalla of Sweden finished first to win the first gold medal of the 2018 Winter Games. The defending champion Marit Bjørgen finished second. For her, this was the eleventh Olympic medal, making her the most successful female cross-country skier. Krista Pärmäkoski took bronze.\nSummary.\nThe defending champion Marit Bjørgen, as well as the silver medalist Charlotte Kalla and the bronze medalist Heidi Weng, participated in the event. After the exchange, a group of about a dozen athletes stayed ahead, and by 11 km only 9 left. Then Charlotte Kalla escaped, leaving behind Bjørgen, Krista Pärmäkoski, and Ebba Andersson chasing her. Kalla became the champion, with Bjørgen second, and Pärmäkoski third.\nIn the nighttime victory ceremony, the medals for the event were presented by Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, accompanied by Roman Kumpost, FIS council member.\nQualification.\nA total of up to 310 cross-country skiers qualified across all eleven events. Athletes qualified for this event by having met the A qualification standard, which meant having 100 or less FIS Points in the distance classification. The Points list takes into average the best results of athletes per discipline during the qualification period (1 July 2016 to 21 January 2018). Countries received additional quotas by having athletes ranked in the top 30 of the FIS Olympics Points list (two per gender maximum, overall across all events). Countries also received an additional quota (one per gender maximum) if an athlete was ranked in the top 300 of the FIS Olympics Points list. After the distribution of B standard quotas, the remaining quotas were distributed using the Olympic FIS Points list, with each athlete only counting once for qualification purposes. A country could only enter a maximum of four athletes for the event.\nResults.\nThe race was started at 16:15."

        "text": "The 2018 Daytona 500, the 60th running of the event, was a Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race held on February 18, 2018, contested over 207 laps—extended from 200 laps due to an overtime finish—on the asphalt superspeedway. It was the first race of the 2018 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series season, and also marked the first race for the Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 as Chevrolet's car for this season, replacing the SS. Austin Dillon of Richard Childress Racing won the race after contact with Aric Almirola on the final lap resulted in a single-car accident for the latter. Bubba Wallace making his first Daytona 500 start finished second while Denny Hamlin came in third. This was the last Daytona 500 starts for Danica Patrick, Trevor Bayne, Kasey Kahne, David Gilliland, Mark Thompson (in his only Daytona 500 start), BK Racing, Furniture Row Racing and D. J. Kennington.\nReport.\nBackground.\nDaytona International Speedway is one of six superspeedways to hold NASCAR races, the others being Michigan International Speedway, Auto Club Speedway, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Pocono Raceway, and Talladega Superspeedway. The standard track at Daytona International Speedway is a four-turn superspeedway that is long. The track's turns are banked at 31 degrees, while the front stretch, the location of the finish line, is banked at 18 degrees.\nNotes.\nThis was the first Daytona 500 race since 1982 where none of the cars were sponsored by beer companies (Kevin Harvick and Brad Keselowski, sponsored by Anheuser-Busch InBev and MillerCoors, respectively, were instead sponsored by Jimmy John's and Discount Tire for the race). Only 40 cars entered the race, meaning no entrants would fail to qualify for the race.\nPractice.\nFirst practice (February 10).\nKyle Busch was the fastest in the first practice session with a time of 45.058 seconds and a speed of .\nSecond practice (February 10).\nWilliam Byron was the fastest in the second practice session with a time of 44.625 seconds and a speed of .\nQualifying.\nAlex Bowman scored the pole for the race with a time of 46.002 and a speed of .\nCan-Am Duels.\nThe Can-Am Duels are a pair of NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races held in conjunction with the Daytona 500 annually in February at Daytona International Speedway. They consist of two races 60 laps and 150 miles (240 km) in length, which serve as heat races that set the lineup for the Daytona 500. The first race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in odd-numbered positions on pole qualifying day, while the second race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in even-numbered positions. The Duels set the lineup for positions 3–38, while positions 39 and 40 are filled by the two \"Open\" (teams without a charter) cars that set the fastest times in qualifying, but did not lock in a spot in the Duels.\nFor championship purposes, each Duel is a full Championship Stage, except there is no playoff point awarded. The top ten drivers receive championship points.\nPractice (post–Duels).\nThird practice (February 16).\nDaniel Suárez was the fastest in the third practice session with a time of 45.036 seconds and a speed of .\nFourth practice (February 16).\nDaniel Suárez was the fastest in the fourth practice session with a time of 44.296 seconds and a speed of .\nFinal practice (February 17).\nBubba Wallace was the fastest in the final practice session with a time of 45.696 seconds and a speed of .\nRace.\nStage 1.\nStart.\nThe 60th running of the Daytona 500 began with Alex Bowman leading the field to the green flag. Denny Hamlin took the lead on lap 1 and led the first 10 laps. The first caution of the race came out on lap 9 when Corey LaJoie blew an engine in Turn 2, and Hamlin was penalized one lap for pitting outside his box prior to the caution.\nRacing resumed on lap 13. Kyle Busch's tire went flat on lap 30 and had to pit, dropping him from 5th to 38th to get his tire fixed. The second caution came out on lap 52 for a three-car wreck in turn 3. Kyle Busch spun out prior to the same time his tire went flat. The first ten cars did not opt to pit, waiting instead for the end of the first 60-lap stage, the second points-paying stage of the year (the Duels count as a championship points stage, but not a playoff points stage).\nThe race went back to green on lap 56, with five laps remaining in the first stage. On Lap 60, the final lap of the stage, a major pileup occurred on the end of the backstretch, bringing out the third caution flag of the race. The crash was triggered when Ricky Stenhouse Jr. attempted to block Ryan Blaney battling for second. Stenhouse briefly lost control of his car before saving it, but the resulting slowdown led to Erik Jones spinning in front of the field and starting the wreck. As the stage ended under caution 2017 Daytona 500 champion and leader Kurt Busch won the stage. A total of nine cars was involved in the melee, including William Byron, Erik Jones, Ty Dillon, Daniel Suárez, Jimmie Johnson, Ricky Stenhouse Jr., Ryan Blaney, Martin Truex Jr., and Kyle Larson. A total of four cars were out of the race, including Jimmie Johnson, Daniel Suárez, Erik Jones, and Ty Dillon.\nStage 2.\nStage 1 winner Kurt Busch was penalized for missing his pit box on the ensuing round of pit stops.\nRacing restarted on lap 67. Ryan Blaney assumed the lead on lap 68 and led 26 laps until Paul Menard took the lead from Blaney on lap 94 and led one lap, but debris on the back straightaway brought out the fourth caution of the race on lap 94, from William Byron's car, and Martin Truex Jr. chose not to pit and he took the lead a lap later.\nRacing resumed on lap 97. The fifth caution of the race came out for a seven-car wreck in turn 3 another (The Big One) involving Chase Elliott, Danica Patrick, Kevin Harvick, David Ragan, Martin Truex Jr., Brad Keselowski, and Kasey Kahne. A total of eleven cars were out of the race.\nRestart occurred on Lap 109 for a 12-lap shootout to the end of the second stage, which Ryan Blaney won, claiming the ten championship and one playoff point after crossing the line to complete Lap 120.\nFinal stage.\nBack to the green flag with 73 to go, Denny Hamlin took the lead with 28 to go and led 3 laps, and Ryan Blaney assumed the lead with 26 to go and led 26 laps. The caution flew for the seventh time with 9 to go for a single-car spin as William Byron spun out into turn 2, so that meant Joey Logano won the free pass under caution.\nRacing resumed with 6 to go and a major multi-car wreck (a third \"The Big One\") brought out the eighth caution of the race. 2017 Daytona 500 winner Kurt Busch tried to pass Denny Hamlin but contact behind him triggered the melee. A total of twelve cars were involved including Kurt Busch, Martin Truex Jr., Matt DiBenedetto, Ricky Stenhouse Jr., Ryan Blaney, Alex Bowman, Ryan Newman, Joey Logano, Bubba Wallace, Jeffrey Earnhardt, Brendan Gaughan, and A. J. Allmendinger. The multi-car wreck sent the race into overtime.\nOvertime.\nThe race resumed on lap 205 of 200 advertised, for a 2-lap NASCAR Overtime. Aric Almirola was leading at the white flag, but a mistimed block on the super stretch forced Austin Dillon to drive into his right-rear corner and turn Almirola into the wall. Dillon drove on and scored his second career NASCAR Monster Energy Cup Series victory along with Dillon’s first career Daytona 500 victory, 20 years after Dale Earnhardt won the 1998 Daytona 500 in the same seat. After the September 2017 closure of the deal between Dillon's sponsor Dow Chemical to acquire E. I. DuPont and Nemours (which had been a NASCAR sponsor from 1992 to 2012), this win was the first for the merged DowDuPont, bringing together two major race-winning sponsors.\nPost race.\n\"I did what I had to do in the end; I hate it for the 10 Guys\" said Dillon, after a series of burnouts. This was in reference to contact between the two on the final lap.\nRace results.\nStage Results.\nStage One\n\"Laps:\" 60\nStage Two\n\"Laps:\" 60\nFinal Stage Results.\nStage Three\n\"Laps:\" 80\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nSince 2001—with the exception of 2002, 2004 and 2006—the Daytona 500 has been carried by Fox in the United States. The booth crew consisted of longtime NASCAR lap-by-lap announcer Mike Joy, three–time Daytona 500 champion Jeff Gordon, and 1989 race winner Darrell Waltrip. Pit road was manned by Jamie Little, Regan Smith, Vince Welch and Matt Yocum.\nRadio.\nThe race was broadcast on radio by the Motor Racing Network—who has covered the Daytona 500 since 1970—and simulcast on Sirius XM NASCAR Radio. The booth crew consisted of longtime announcer Joe Moore, Jeff Striegle and 1989 Cup Series champion Rusty Wallace. Longtime turn announcer – and prodigy of MRN co-founder Ken Squier – Dave Moody was the lead turn announcer. He called the Daytona 500 from atop the Sunoco tower outside the exit of turn 2 when the field was racing through turns 1 and 2. Mike Bagley worked the backstretch for the Daytona 500 from a spotter's stand on the inside of the track. Kyle Rickey called the Daytona 500 when the field was racing through turns 3 and 4 from the Sunoco tower outside the exit of turn 4. On pit road, MRN was manned by lead pit reporter and NASCAR Hall of Fame Executive Director Winston Kelley. He was joined on pit road by Steve Post, Kim Coon and Alex Hayden."

        "title": "Snow volleyball",
        "text": "Snow volleyball is a winter team sport played by two teams of three players on a snow court divided by a net. The objective of each team is to score points by sending a ball over the net so as to ground it on the opponent's court, and to prevent the same effort by the opponent. A team is allowed up to three touches to return the ball across the net, and individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively.\nThe sport originated in Austria as a variant of beach volleyball, with a local Snow Volleyball Tour being established in 2009. The sport gained recognition by the European Volleyball Confederation (CEV) in 2015, and the following year saw the inaugural CEV Snow Volleyball European Tour, followed by the inaugural FIVB Snow Volleyball World Tour in 2019. The Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) is the international governing body for the sport.\nHistory.\nVolleyball has been played on snow for decades, especially in countries such as Russia, Austria and Switzerland, even though without any specifically codified rules, but simply as a variation of the Volleyball game on snow. Unofficial Snow Volleyball competitions were held in Austria and Switzerland in the late 90s, before the idea reemerged in 2008, upon the initiative of Martin Kaswurm, a local promoter. The sport gained popularity in Wagrain, Austria, in 2008, and the first Snow Volleyball Tour was set up the following year. It was recognized as an official sport by the Austrian Volleyball Association in 2011. Initially taking place across Austria, the Tour expanded to include stops in other European countries by 2013. The European Volleyball Confederation (CEV) officially added the sport in October 2015 and organized the first CEV Snow Volleyball European Tour in 2016. The inaugural CEV European Snow Volleyball Championships took place in March 2018 in Austria. A Snow Volleyball European Tour under the umbrella of the CEV has taken place yearly ever since, with events held in countries as diverse as Austria, Czech Republic, Georgia, Italy, Liechtenstein, Russia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Turkey, while national championships qualifying to the inaugural European Championships were organised by 17 National Federations in the winter of 2018. According to \"Yahoo Sports\", the International Volleyball Federation and the European Volleyball Confederation recruited beach volleyball Olympians from countries like Brazil, China, South Korea, and Austria to compete in a demonstration at the Austria House, where the athletes donned warm clothing, gloves, and soccer cleats to bump, set, and spike on a snowy court. \nWith plans to make snow volleyball part of the future Winter Olympic Games programme, the FIVB and the CEV recruited former beach volleyball Olympians to compete in a demonstration of the sport at the 2018 Winter Olympics. Since then, more efforts have been made to increase global participation in the sport. In the first tournament of the 2018–19 European Tour season, teams from the United States, Brazil and Kazakhstan were invited to compete for the first time. Meanwhile, the inaugural FIVB Snow Volleyball World Tour started in 2019, with two events co-hosted by the FIVB and CEV in Wagrain and Plan de Corones, followed by the first extra-European such event held in Bariloche, Argentina. Teams from countries with little tradition in winter sports such as Brazil and Argentina have been able to claim their first international medals in any snow or ice sports through the introduction of the Snow Volleyball World Tour.\nRules.\nCourt and equipment.\nSnow volleyball is played on a rectangular snow court. The court is long and wide, surrounded by a clear space, which is at least wide on all sides. The snow should be at least deep, and as leveled as possible and free of potential hazards such as rocks that could cause injuries to players. The court is divided into equal halves by a net that is long and wide. The top of the net is 2.43 m (7 ft 11 11⁄16 in) above the center of the court for men's competition, and 2.24 m (7 ft 4 3⁄16 in) for women's competition. An antenna, long and in diameter, is attached to each side edge of the net.\nThe antennae are considered part of the net and extend above it, forming the lateral boundaries within which the ball is allowed to cross.\nFIVB regulations state that the ball must be spherical and made of flexible and water resistant material, such that it is appropriate for outdoor conditions. A snow volleyball ball has a circumference of 66–68 cm and a weight of 260–280 g.\nTeams.\nFor a long period, Snow Volleyball was played 2 vs 2 as with Beach Volleyball. This changed to 3 vs 3 at the start of the 2018/2019 season in a move to make the game more appealing and make the rallies last longer. A team is composed of three starters and one substitute. Each team is allowed to make up to two substitutions per set. Coaching during matches is not allowed.\nScoring.\nA team scores a point when: the ball lands on the opposing team's court; the opposing team hits the ball \"out\"; the opposing team commits a fault; or the opposing team receives a penalty. The team that won the point serves for the next point. The ball is considered \"out\" if it: lands on the ground completely outside the boundary lines (a ball is \"in\" if any part of it touches a sideline or end-line); touches an object or person (who is not a player) outside the court; touches the net's antennae; does not cross the net's lateral boundaries (within the antennae) during service or during a team's third contact; crosses completely under the net.\nA set is won by the first team to reach 15 points with a two-point advantage. A match is won by the first team to win two sets.\nDifferences with the beach game.\nOriginating as a variant of beach volleyball, the rules of snow volleyball are similar to the beach game. Besides the playing surface, the main differences between snow and beach volleyball are the scoring system and the number of players. As in the beach version, matches were originally best of 3 sets played to 21 points, with two players in a team. In December 2018, the FIVB approved new rules for snow volleyball which changed the scoring system to a best of 3 sets played to 15 points, and the number of players to three starters and one substitute in a team. Another difference is that unlike beach volleyball, a touch off block does not count as one of the three allowed touches, and any player may make the subsequent touch after the block.\nAttire.\nThere is no mandatory outfit that teams must wear. Players often wear thermal clothing and cleats to provide grip on the snow. Waterproof clothing is also very popular. The FIVB allows players to wear beanies, sunglasses, and gloves to provide protection and warmth.\nGameplay.\nThe teams start on opposite sides of the net. One team is designated the \"serving\" team and opposing team is the \"receiving\" team. A coin toss is conducted by the referee before the warm-ups to determine which team serves first and which sides of the court the teams start on for the first two sets. If a third deciding set is needed, another coin toss will be conducted prior to the third set. The service order decided at the coin toss before a set is maintained throughout the set.\nFor each point, a player from the serving team initiates the \"serve\" by tossing the ball into the air and attempting to hit the ball so it passes over the net on a course such that it will land in the opposing team's court. The opposing team must use a combination of no more than three contacts with the ball to return the ball to the opponent's side of the net, and individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively. The three contacts usually consist first of the \"bump\" or \"pass\", second of the \"set\" so that the ball's trajectory is aimed towards a spot where it can be hit, and third of the \"spike\" (jumping, raising one arm above the head and hitting the ball so it will move quickly down to the ground on the opponent's court) or \"shot\" to return the ball over the net. The team with possession of the ball that is trying to attack the ball as described is said to be on \"offense\".\nThe team on \"defense\" attempts to prevent the attacking team from directing the ball into their court: the at the net jumps and reaches above the top (and if possible, across the plane) of the net to \"block\" the attacked ball. If the ball is hit around, above, or through the block, the defensive positioned behind the attempts to control the ball with a \"dig\" (usually a forearm pass). After a successful dig, the team transitions to offense.\nThe game continues in this manner, rallying back and forth, until the ball touches the court within the boundaries or until a fault is committed.\nTeams switch ends of the court after every 5 points played. Each team may request one 30-second time-out per set."

In the final, defending champions India defeated Pakistan by 2 wickets to secure their 2nd Blind Cricket World Cup title under the captaincy of Ajay Kumar Reddy. Six teams, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Australia and Nepal played in the tournament, with Nepal making their first ever appearance.\nIndia played all of their group stage matches of the tournament at neutral venues in the United Arab Emirates, after the foreign ministry of India blocked them from travelling to Pakistan. It was later revealed that the Cricket Association for the Blind in India and Pakistan Blind Cricket Council had agreed to shift the Indian matches to the UAE. Thus, only Nepal and Bangladesh were willing to play matches in Pakistan.\nInitially, Pakistan was selected as the main host nation to host the tournament, with the UAE later agreeing to host some of the matches. It was the first time that Pakistan had been selected to host the Blind Cricket World Cup since 2006, and marked the first instance where UAE also had hosted few matches as a part of the World Cup.\nSharjah Cricket Stadium hosted the final between India and Pakistan on 20 January; prior to the World Cup, Pakistan had originally been selected to host the final. India and Pakistan were the only teams to play against each other in the finals of the Blind Cricket World Cup on three consecutive occasions.\nIn the final, Pakistan batted first and managed to score 308/8 after being put into bat by India. India chased down the target of 309 with 16 balls to spare to clinch the title. India thus maintained their unbeaten record in the tournament.\nVenues.\nGaddafi Stadium was the only venue to host the Blind Cricket World Cup matches in Pakistan. In the UAE, International standard cricket venues including Ajman Oval were chosen to host some of the matches.\nGroup stage.\n15 group league matches took place during the tournament.\nBroadcasting.\nPTV Sports, the Premier 24 hour Pakistani sport channel was awarded the rights to host the 40 overs Blind Cricket World Cup tournament."

The regatta in Copenhagen was held from 14 to 18 August.\nGerman participation.\nThe rowing federations of East and West Germany met at the end of July in Hanover to discuss how their rowers should be represented. FISA did not recognise East Germany as a country and insisted on one German team per boat class. The negotiations were overshadowed by political tension—the Berlin Wall had been built two years earlier—and did not result in an agreement. The decision was thus made by FISA that selection trials for men were to be held at the Olympic regatta course in Grünau in East Berlin on 9 August. The West German rowers won the races in all seven boat classes. The closest result was the photo finish of the coxless pair, where the West German team was 0.05 seconds ahead.\nAt a FISA meeting held in conjunction with the 1963 regatta, the East German rowing association asked for separate German teams to be allowed to compete in future. The vote on the item was 37 against and 15 in favour of the proposal, and the motion was thus rejected.\nMedal summary – men's events.\nThe finals were held during heavy rain. In the single sculls, the inaugural world champion, Vyacheslav Ivanov, came fourth. Medallists at the 1963 European Rowing Championships for men were:"

Wood was drafted 84th overall by the Colorado Avalanche in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft.\nPlaying career.\nWood played youth hockey in his hometown of Waterloo, Ontario, and was selected in the third round, 57th overall, by the Brampton Battalion of the OHL Priority Selection in 2012.\nWood was selected after the 2013–14 season by the Colorado Avalanche in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft, 84th overall. In his final year of junior eligibility, the Avalanche traded Wood's NHL rights, along with those of Alex Tanguay and Conner Bleackley, to the Arizona Coyotes in exchange for Mikkel Boedker on February 29, 2016.\nAt the conclusion of the 2015–16 OHL season with the North Bay Battalion, Wood signed a three-year, entry-level contract with the Coyotes on March 27, 2016. This was later revised to an amateur try-out deal, which he made with their AHL affiliate, the Springfield Falcons.\nAfter attending his first training camp with the Coyotes, Wood was reassigned to new AHL affiliate, the Tucson Roadrunners, for the 2016–17 season. In his first pro season, he earned October Rookie of the Month honors by registering points in all games. He also represented the Roadrunners at the AHL All-Star Classic. Wood finished the season with 13 goals and 40 points in 63 games, earning selection to the AHL All-Rookie Team.\nOn June 15, 2018, the Coyotes traded Wood to the San Jose Sharks for Adam Helewka. The Sharks re-signed him to a one-year contract on July 12, 2019. \nOn August 6, 2019, Wood was traded to the Carolina Hurricanes for Trevor Carrick. After the 2019 training camp, the Canes sent him to the Charlotte Checkers of the AHL for the 2019–20 season where he contributed 3 goals and 5 points in 14 games before being traded, for the fourth time in his professional career, going to the Detroit Red Wings in exchange for Oliwer Kaski on December 12, 2019.\nUnable to impress within the Red Wings organization, Wood as an impending restricted free agent was not tendered a qualifying offer by the club and was released to free agency on October 8, 2020. Having played through 5 NHL organizations and unable to feature at top level, Wood left North America to sign his first European contract, agreeing to a one-year contract with second tier German club, Löwen Frankfurt of the DEL2, on November 2, 2020. Regaining his scoring touch from the blueline, Wood contributed with 5 goals and 21 points through 32 regular season games for Frankfurt.\nAs a free agent, Wood left Germany and opted to continue his European career in the Czech Republic, signing a one-year contract with Rytíři Kladno of the ELH, on July 14, 2021."

Arkansas 4, Florida 2\nSixth inning — Following 89 pitches and 2 strikeouts, Florida elected to pull Brady Singer from the game and put Tommy Mace on the mound. On Mace's second pitch, Jared Gates singled to left field for the Hogs' eighth hit of the night. Jax Biggers took advantage of a wild throw to first on his hit, advancing to second and moving Gates to third. Casey Martin continued a good night with a single and another Razorback RBI, putting runners on the corners. Unfortunately for the Hogs, 2 runners were stranded when Kjerstad chased a pitch in the dirt for the third out.\nDeacon Liput reached base after a wild throw to first, Arkansas' first error of the game. After throwing 85 pitches and recording 8 strikeouts in innings, Isaiah Campbell exited the game and right-hander Jake Reindl took the mound. Reindl's first pitch resulted in a fly-out to center, as did his ninth, which ended the inning. Arkansas 5, Florida 2\nSeventh inning — First up for Arkansas was Luke Bonfield; he grounded out to short for the inning's first out. The second came several pitches later as Dominic Fletcher popped up to center field. Carson Shaddy struck out on a 1–2 pitch to end the inning moments later, marking the second inning of the game without an Arkansas runner on base.\nThe first pitch of the bottom of the seventh resulted in a fly-out to left field. Two Florida batters then walked, but Reindl regained his confidence to finish the inning with a strikeout and a groundout to third, stranding two Gator batters. Arkansas 5, Florida 2\nEighth inning — Jared Gates and Grant Koch provided two quick outs before Jax Biggers found center field for a single. However, Biggers ended the inning stranded after Eric Cole was thrown out at first several pitches later.\nReindl was taken out of the game, having thrown 27 pitches (with 1 strikeout), and left-handed closer Matt Cronin took the mound. On his fifth pitch, leadoff hitter Deacon Liput ripped a single to right for his first hit of the night and the Gators' third. A fly ball to left field that found the glove of Heston Kjerstad was the source of the first out, with the second coming on a called strike three to Jonathan India and the third coming a pitch later on a fly ball to deep center field. Arkansas 5, Florida 2\nNinth inning — The ninth inning began with Casey Martin popping up, the first time on the night he had not reached base. Heston Kjerstad flew out to center two pitches later, ending his night at 0–5. Luke Bonfield singled to center on the next pitch, his second hit of the night. Several pitches later, however, Dominic Fletcher was thrown out at first, putting the game in the hands of his defense.\nThe bottom of the ninth began with a long, fly ball to right field; the ball was caught by Eric Cole in foul territory for the first out. The next batter up was Austin Langworthy, who grounded out to first for the second out. Matt Cronin then delivered his second strikeout of the game on a 0–2 pitch, retiring Blake Reese and ending the game, sending Arkansas to the College World Series Championship Series for the first time since 1979. Arkansas 5, Florida 2\nCWS Championship Series.\nGame 1.\nGame 1 of the CWS Championship series was originally scheduled for June 25 at 6:00 p.m. CDT, but it was postponed to June 26 due to inclement weather following a 97–minute delay."

Schoemehl asked if he would be interested in helping give the Blues local ownership. “That’s a question you don’t expect,” Shanahan later recalled. “But we began discussing it, and I got involved.” Shanahan led an investment group that purchased the Blues from California businessman Harry Ornest in December 1986, when Ornest was in talks to move the team to Saskatoon (Canada). At the same time, the city purchased the St. Louis Arena (1929-1999) from Ornest. His gregarious personality and daring management style made him one of the most popular executives in the region's sports history. Under his leadership in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the St. Louis Blues regained their standing as a mainstream sports attraction. In 1990, Shanahan sold his 10-percent ownership stake to an investment group called Kiel Center Partners, which built a new downtown arena in 1994. Shanahan stayed on as team chairman until 1995, when he was replaced by former Cardinals executive Jerry Ritter.\nShanahan donated more than $10 million to mostly St. Louis charitable efforts personally and through the Shanahan Family Foundation. The atrium at the business school at St. Louis University, his alma mater, is named after him.\nHe was inducted into the St. Louis University Billikens Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame in 1997.\nHe died after a fall on January 15, 2018, aged 78. He was survived by his wife Mary Anne, his son Michael Junior, his daughters Meg and Maureen and his 13 grandchildren."

For cancer treatment, Rhodes underwent thirty-five radiation treatments and seven chemotherapy sessions over a seven-week span, which caused him to lose about 80 pounds. By late April, the tumor had disappeared."

Every athlete's leg is skied over three laps for a total of , with two shooting rounds: one prone and one standing. For every round of five targets there are eight bullets available, though the last three can only be single-loaded manually from the spare round holders or from bullets deposited by the athlete into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If after eight bullets there are still standing targets, one penalty loop must be taken for each remaining target. The first-leg participants start all at the same time, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of their position in the race), then for the remainder of the relay, the athletes shoot at the lane corresponding to the position they arrived (arrive at the range in 5th place, shoot at lane five)."

        "text": "Steve Davis World Snooker is a sports simulation video game developed by Binary Design and published by CDS Software. It simulates different types of cue sports, specifically snooker, pool and billiards. Released under licence from 6-time Snooker World Champion, Steve Davis, it is a sequel to their 1984 game \"Steve Davis Snooker\".\nDevelopment.\nThe game had specific contributions from programmer Mick West, whom this was his first Amiga game he programmed. He stated that it took the team \"around 6 months\" to program the game, and was harder as the game's artist was not full-time. West also described the development style; \"For Steve Davis, I'd code on one machine, write it to a floppy, and then insert it into another machine. Rather slow, but then the game was small, so loaded quickly.\"\nOverview.\n\"World Snooker\" is an updated 16-bit version of CDS Software's earlier 8-bit Steve Davis game. Game Modes include; ten or fifteen snooker, pool (including variants eight-ball, nine-ball and blackball and english and carom billiards. All games modes can be played in single-player, multiplayer, or against the AI, with the AI taking the form of Steve Davis. The program has six different levels of playing skill. The view is fixed overhead, however you can zoom in on the table, with the option of slow motion replays. The game also has a practice mode, in which lines indicate what the results of a shot will be, and balls can be moved around to set up trick shots.\nReception.\n\"World Snooker\" received average to positive results from critics. Computer and Video Games magazine scored the game at 72% on both versions. \"CVG\" praised the game's \"brilliant\" presentation, that was \"bound to appeal to fans of the sport\" but criticized the game's high difficulty, but did acknowledge there was \"plenty to keep enthusiasts amused for hours on end\".\nZzap magazine also scored the game highly at 75% when reviewing the Amiga version, saying the game was \"a pretty slick snooker sim which is bound to appeal to all Davis fans.\" The Games Machine rated the game highly at 81% for both versions of the game, saying it was a \"must have for mouse-wielding cue freaks.\"\nAdvanced Computing Entertainment magazine gave the game, 540/1000 commenting that while \"It's fun to play as a game in its own right, and does have lasting interest, as long as you appreciate its idiosyncrasies\", \"genuine snooker and pool enthusiasts won't be greatly impressed.\""

        "title": "Mario Tennis Aces",
        "text": "Mario Tennis Aces is a 2018 tennis game developed by Camelot Software Planning and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. The game is part of the \"Mario Tennis\" series and sold over four million copies by the end of 2021, making it one of the best-selling games on the Switch. The game received generally favorable reviews from critics.\nGameplay.\nThe gameplay of \"Mario Tennis Aces\" consists of playing matches of tennis with various characters from the \"Super Mario\" series. Players can pick from Mario, Luigi, Wario, Peach, Waluigi, Daisy, Rosalina, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Bowser, Toad, Toadette, Chain Chomp, Bowser Jr., Boo, and Spike. New characters were added by participating in monthly tournaments, or were added to the roster the following month if the player did not participate. Numerous characters have been added in the game such as; Koopa Troopa in July 2018, Blooper in August 2018, Diddy Kong in September 2018, Birdo in October 2018, Koopa Paratroopa in November 2018, Petey Piranha and Shy Guy in December 2018, Luma in January 2019, Boom Boom in February 2019, Pauline in March 2019, Kamek in April 2019, Dry Bones in May 2019, Fire Piranha Plant in June 2019, and Dry Bowser in July 2019.\nSimilar in fashion to previous installments of the series, \"Aces\" incorporates many techniques, such as \"topspins\", where the ball travels parallel to the direction hit, \"slices\", where the ball curves to one side when hit, and \"lobs\", where the ball travels upwards.\n\"Aces\" adds several new mechanics to the \"Mario Tennis\" series. Using the motion controls of the Joy-Con, the player is able to initiate a \"zone shot\", where the player can aim directly where the ball will go while the game enters a paused state. If the opponent counters the zone shot, their racket will take damage. When a racket is hit with a zone shot three times, it will break, forcing the player to forfeit the match if it is their last one. Players have multiple rackets to use each match. However, players are able to counter a zone shot without taking damage using a \"block\", which can be performed by hitting the ball with perfect timing.\nAnother new addition in \"Aces\" is \"zone speed\". When a player activates zone speed, the match goes into slow-motion, but their character moves at normal speed, making it so faraway shots are easier to reach. The zone shot and zone speed moves use up part of the players' energy gauge, which is filled and depleted throughout the match. To refill the gauge, the player must keep a rally going with the opponent or use the trick shot ability.\nThe trick shot ability enables the player to quickly travel to where the ball will land. If the trick shot succeeds, then the player's energy gauge will increase dramatically. However, it is easy to misjudge the timing and therefore is a risky move to make. Another ability available to players at the cost of their energy gauge is the special shot. To activate it, the player must have a full energy gauge. The ability unleashes an extremely powerful shot that has the power to break the opponent's racket regardless of its current damage. However, the special shot can be blocked similarly to the zone shot.\n\"Aces\" also has a \"Simple rules\" mode, equivalent to the Classic Tennis mode introduced in \"\", where only simple shots are allowed and zone shots, zone speed, trick shots, special shots and the energy gauge are not present.\nThe game also features an online multiplayer mode, where tournaments can be set up, as well as singular matches. Players can unlock additional outfits and characters by participating in special online Tournaments held by Nintendo. Another gameplay mode is \"swing mode\", where players are able to swing the Joy-Con controllers to simulate hitting the ball with a tennis racket, similar in fashion to \"Wii Sports\" and the \"New Play Control!\" version of \"Mario Power Tennis\". In addition to regular tennis matches, the game offers a story mode similar in fashion to \"\".\nPlot.\nWario and Waluigi are mining at the Temple of Bask when they discover a treasure chest containing Lucien, a magical racket said to be legendary to those who would possess it. The duo perceive themselves as displaying pride at matches using Lucien, and open up the treasure chest to unveil it. Just as they obtain Lucien, the racket unveils its power and shocks the duo.\nThe duo soon emerge at Marina Stadium, immediately following a championship match in which Mario and Peach won against Bowser and Bowser Jr. The duo attempt to offer Lucien to Mario, but Luigi snatches it up, after which it begins to take possession of him, Wario, and Waluigi, through use of its grip tape. Mario and Toad then embark on a journey to destroy Lucien and save Wario, Luigi and Waluigi, on Daisy's plea that Luigi will be brought back safely.\nMario and Toad soon arrive at the Bask Ruins, where they meet Aster, guardian of King Bask and watcher over Lucien. Aster tells the backstory of Lucien and how many years ago, King Bask stripped Lucien's power and divided it among five Power Stones hidden on the island, and years later the room fell to ruin, breaking the seal and allowing the racket to fall into new hands. Aster requests that Mario find the Power Stones to end Lucien, once and for all.\nMario obtains the first three Power Stones by defeating Petey Piranha in Piranha Plant Forest, The Mirror Queen in Mirage Mansion, and the Snow Ogre at the summit of Snowfall Mountain respectively. Mario tries to claim the Power Stones in the Savage Sea and Inferno Island, but they are claimed by Wario, Waluigi, and Luigi. Wario and Waluigi decide to settle the score at Marina Stadium; whoever wins receives all five Power Stones.\nThe Princesses take on Wario and Waluigi while Mario takes on Luigi, with slight power given to the Princesses and Mario by Aster, respectively. They win, allowing them to receive the Power Stones, but Bowser gets ahold of Lucien before this can happen, and makes off to the Temple of Bask with it. Mario confronts him inside the Temple and not only defeats him, but breaks Lucien causing the entire Temple to collapse. With the spirit of King Bask now able to rest in peace, Aster thanks Mario for his heroism throughout the quest.\nBack outside, everyone celebrates Mario's victory in banishing Lucien and saving Luigi, Wario and Waluigi, although the latter two are shamed by Daisy for attempting to use Lucien to be the best tennis players. The gang agrees that getting stronger is better than trying to control others.\nRelease.\nThe game was announced during a Nintendo Direct presentation in January 2018. A free online tournament using a demo version of the game was held from June 1–3, 2018.\nReception.\n\"Mario Tennis Aces\" has an aggregate score of 75/100 on Metacritic.\n\"IGN\" felt that \"Mario Tennis Aces\" was \"an extremely fun arcade tennis experience, colourful and dazzling to look at and smartly balanced in its back-and-forth play.\" Although praise went to its new mechanics for making the game \"far more fun, well balanced and less gimmicky brand of superpowered tennis than that of its disappointing Wii U predecessor, \"\",\" \"Aces\" adventure mode was criticized for feeling underdeveloped and not having enough replay value (such as harder versions of challenges after completing it) or unlocks, and that the main multiplayer modes lacked court selection and local tournament functions. \"GameSpot\" felt that \"Mario Tennis Aces\" \"does what this series has done best, and improves what it's rarely gotten right prior\", and arguing that the adventure mode was a good way for existing players to learn the new mechanics of \"Aces\", but that the Swing Mode had imprecise motion detection, and that the game's multiplayer modes were lacking in options, and did not display stats for opponents.\nSales.\n\"Mario Tennis Aces\" sold 247,161 physical copies within its first month on sale in Japan. By March 2019, total sales had reached over 2.64 million copies, making it the best-selling \"Mario Tennis\" game. As of March 2019, it has sold 550,000 copies in Japan. The 2022 CESA Games White Papers revealed that \"Mario Tennis Aces\" had sold 4.28 million units, as of December 31, 2021. By December 31 2022, this figure had risen to 4.50 million units."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career fielding errors as a third baseman leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, an error is an act, in the judgment of the official scorer, of a fielder misplaying a ball in a manner that allows a batter or baserunner to advance one or more bases or allows an at bat to continue after the batter should have been put out. Third base is the third of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a baserunner in order to score a run for that player's team. A third baseman, abbreviated 3B, is the player on the team playing defense who fields the area nearest third base, and is responsible for the majority of plays made at that base. The third baseman requires good reflexes in reacting to batted balls, often being the closest infielder (roughly 90–120 feet) to the batter. The third base position requires a strong and accurate arm, as the third baseman often makes long throws to first base. The third baseman sometimes must throw quickly to second base in time to start a double play, and must also field fly balls in both fair and foul territory. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the third baseman is assigned the number 5.\nThe list of career leaders is dominated by players from the 19th century, when fielding equipment was very rudimentary; baseball gloves only began to steadily gain acceptance in the 1880s, and were not uniformly worn until the mid-1890s, resulting in a much lower frequency of defensive miscues. The top 19 players in career errors all began playing in the 19th century, all but four of them playing their entire careers before 1900; none were active in the major leagues after 1911. Only two of the top 29 were active after 1929, and none were active after 1946. Through 2021, the top 129 single-season totals were all recorded before 1906, and only five of the top 316 were recorded after 1942. To a large extent, the leaders reflect longevity rather than lower skill. Ron Santo, who leads all post-1950 third basemen with 317 errors, won five Gold Glove Awards for fielding excellence.\nArlie Latham, who set a major league record with 1,573 career games at third base – none of them after 1896 – is the all-time leader in career errors committed as a third baseman with 822, more than twice as many as any player who reached the major leagues after 1900; he is the only third baseman to commit more than 700 career errors. Billy Nash, whose career ended in 1898 after setting the National League record for games at third base, is second all-time; he is the only other third baseman to commit more than 600 errors. Evan Longoria, who had 152 errors through the 2021 season to place him tied for 131st all-time, is the leader among active players."

Anastasiya Kuzmina won the gold medal, the defending champion Darya Domracheva took the silver, and Tiril Eckhoff replicated her 2014 bronze medal success.\nSummary.\nKuzmina was leading from the start, and was skiing alone after the second shooting, with Domracheva ten seconds behind. In the first standing shooting, Domracheva missed a target, and Kuzmina, despite a missed target in the second standing shooting, was never seriously challenged for first place. Domracheva did not miss a target in the last shooting and went on to finish second. Eckhoff missed one target in the first prone shooting and one in the first standing shooting, and for most of the race was skiing in the middle of the field. However, in the last shooting all of her direct competitors missed, and she left the shooting range in third place and went on to take the bronze medal.\nResults.\nThe race was started at 20:15."

        "text": "Men's ice hockey tournaments have been staged at the Olympic Games since 1920. The men's tournament was introduced as a demonstration sport at the 1920 Summer Olympics, and made a permanent sport when the Winter Olympics began in 1924. The Soviet Union participated in nine tournaments, the first in 1956 and the last in 1988. A total of 11 goaltenders and 95 skaters represented the Soviet Union at the Olympics.\nThe Olympic Games were originally intended for amateur athletes, so the players of the National Hockey League (NHL) and other professional leagues were not allowed to compete. The countries that benefited most were the Soviet Bloc countries of Eastern Europe, where top athletes were state-sponsored while retaining their status as amateurs. In protest at this policy, Canada withdrew from the 1972 and 1976 Olympics. In 1986, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games, starting in 1988.\nThroughout its existence, the Soviet Union was one of the most dominant teams at the Olympics: it won a medal in each of the nine tournaments it participated in, winning seven gold medals, one silver, and one bronze. When the Soviet Union dissolved, it was replaced in subsequent tournaments by the Unified Team (1992) and Russia (since 1994). Six players would play for both the Soviet Union and either the Unified Team or Russia at the Olympics.\nGoaltender Vladislav Tretiak played in four tournaments, the most among all Soviet players. Three players – Viacheslav Fetisov, Vladimir Krutov, and Sergei Makarov – played in the most games, with 22 each across three Olympics. Anatoli Firsov scored the most goals (18), while Valeri Kharlamov had the most assists (22) and the most total points (36). Six players have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, while 28 have been inducted into the International Ice Hockey Hall of Fame."

        "text": "Nigeria sent a delegation to compete at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea from 9–25 February 2018. This marked the debut for the country at the Winter Olympics. The delegation consisted of three bobsledders, who finished 19th in the two-woman competition, and skeleton racer Simidele Adeagbo who came in 20th in the women's event.\nBackground.\nNigeria first participated in the Summer Olympic Games in the 1952 Helsinki Games, but this was the nation's debut appearance at a Winter Olympic Games. The chef de mission for the Nigerian contingent was Gbenga Elegbeleye and Dr David Olusoga Ogbolu. The Nigerian delegation to Pyeongchang consisted of four women: bobsledders Seun Adigun, Akuoma Omeoga, and\nNgozi Onwumere, and skeleton racer Simidele Adeagbo. Onwumere was chosen as the flag bearer for the parade of nations during the opening ceremony, and Adeagbo was selected to carry the flag for the closing ceremony.\nBobsleigh.\nNigeria qualified a team of three athletes in the two-women bobsleigh competition through the quota for continental representation. Seun Adigun was the driver of the sled, while Akuoma Omeoga and Ngozi Onwumere served as breakwomen, only one of which could be in the sled at a time. All three were former track and field athletes, and all were born in the United States. Adigun participated in all four runs, while Omeoga participated in the first two runs, and Onwumere in the last two runs. On 20 February, the first two heats were held, and the Nigerian sled posted times of 52.21 seconds and 52.55 seconds. After the first two heats, they were roughly 3.5 seconds behind the leader. The next day, in the third and fourth runs, their times were 52.31 seconds and 52.53 seconds respectively. Their final time was 3 minutes and 29.60 seconds, which placed them 19th (after one sled from the Olympic Athletes from Russia was disqualified for doping).\nSkeleton.\nNigeria qualified one female skeleton athlete through the quota for continental representation. Simidele Adeagbo is a Canadian native who spent her childhood in Nigeria. She went to university in the United States at the University of Kentucky, where she was part of the track and field team. She only took up skeleton racing in September 2017. Adeagbo is the first female athlete representing an African country to compete in skeleton, and she was 36 years old at the time of the Peyongchang Olympics. On 16 February, she posted run times of 54.19 seconds and 54.58 seconds, making her first day combined time 1 minute and 48.77 seconds. The next day, on her third run, she finished in a time of 53.73 seconds, and her fourth run was completed in 54.28 seconds. After four runs, her final time was 3 minutes and 36.78 seconds, which put her in 20th place."

It also was the fourth-fastest recorded time for an offensive lineman at the combine since 2006, trailing only Eagles' Lane Johnson (4.72), Saints' Terron Armstead (4.71) and Vikings teammate Aviante Collins (4.77). He also had the best time among offensive linemen in the three-cone drill, at 7.14 seconds.\nO'Neill was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings in the second round (62nd overall) of the 2018 NFL draft. He entered the season as a backup tackle behind starters Riley Reiff and Rashod Hill. He made his first career start in Week 6 at right tackle after Rashod Hill was moved to left tackle in place of an injured Riley Reiff. He maintained that starting role the rest of the season over Hill after Reiff returned from injury to play left tackle.\nOn September 8, 2021, O'Neill signed a five-year, $92.5 million contract extension with the Vikings.\nFollowing the 2021 season, O'Neill was named to the 2022 Pro Bowl, his first.\nOn January 3, 2023, O'Neill was placed on injured reserve. Shortly thereafter, he underwent surgery to repair a partially torn Achilles tendon.\nPersonal life.\nO'Neill's father, Brendan, played football at Dartmouth and his mother, Elizabeth, swam at Northeastern. His older brother, Eamon O’Neill, was a two time Delaware player of the year for the Salesianum School soccer team. He went on to star at Northwestern. His uncle is Delaware Governor John Carney, who also played football at Dartmouth."

        "text": "The Super Bowl LVI halftime show, officially known as the Pepsi Super Bowl LVI Halftime Show, was the halftime entertainment of Super Bowl LVI, which took place on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California. The show was headlined by Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige, and Kendrick Lamar, and included guest appearances by 50 Cent and Anderson .Paak. It was the first Super Bowl halftime show to be centered entirely around hip hop music, as well as the last halftime show to be sponsored by Pepsi, with Apple Music taking over the sponsorship beginning with Super Bowl LVII. The show was televised nationally in the U.S. by NBC.\nThe performance was met with critical acclaim and was the first Super Bowl halftime show to win the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special (Live). The show also won the Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Production Design for a Variety Special and Outstanding Music Direction.\nBackground.\nOn May 15, 2021, in an interview with Yahoo!, Snoop Dogg expressed interest in performing at the halftime show with other hip hop artists such as Dr. Dre, Kendrick Lamar and Eminem.\nOn September 30, 2021, Pepsi and Roc Nation announced that Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige, and Kendrick Lamar would headline the show. Blige previously performed at the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show in 2001. The halftime show was produced by Jesse Collins and Roc Nation, and was directed by Hamish Hamilton, who has directed each Super Bowl halftime show for twelve years. Deaf rappers Sean Forbes and Warren \"WAWA\" Snipe performed as American Sign Language interpreters.\nReception.\nThe halftime show received critical acclaim as critics praised the lineup and setlist. Some mentioned that the performance was crafted to induce nostalgia among Generation X and Millennial audiences.\nSteven McIntosh of BBC News wrote that the timing was balanced enough to allow each artist to perform their biggest songs, concluding \"The show had been a success, and they knew it. It might have taken a long time to get here, but after a performance like this, nobody could now Forget About Dre.\"\nA list in \"Rolling Stone\" by Rob Sheffield praised the performance as an \"old-school West Coast rap history lesson\" and ranked it the fourth-best Super Bowl halftime show of all time, behind those by Beyoncé, U2 and Prince. He wrote that Kendrick Lamar deserved his own full-length performance, and named Eminem taking a knee as the highlight.\nKevin E G Perry of \"The Independent\" gave the show four stars out of five. Commenting on criticism relating to Dr. Dre's history of violence against women, Perry concluded \"No performance could wash that blemish from his reputation, but tonight's hit-packed performance did demonstrate the range and longevity of Dre's influence as a rapper and producer\". Perry was also thankful that rumors of the return of the controversial 2012 Tupac hologram were not true.\nIn a review for \"The New York Times\", Jon Caramanica commented that rumors of Eminem being barred from kneeling \"had the feel of a pre-manufactured controversy\"; as an NFL spokesperson confirmed that the gesture was authorized, Caramanica asked \"Is it still protest if it's been signed off on and approved?\"\nSam Wolfson of \"The Guardian\" gave the show five stars out of five.\nThe Federal Communications Commission received 33 complaints regarding the show's content, an unusually low number (compared to 1,300 for the Super Bowl LIV halftime show, 50 for the Super Bowl LIII halftime show and 540,000 for the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show).\nCommercial impact.\nThe show had an average of 103.4 million viewers in the 8:15–8:30 pm ET slot, up 7 percent from the previous year's halftime show by the Weeknd. The viewership for the halftime show was higher than the game itself, which was viewed by an average of 101.1 million television viewers.\nFollowing the performance, streams of Dr. Dre's music rose by 185 percent on Spotify. Two of the songs that he performed, \"The Next Episode\" and \"Still D.R.E.\" from his 1999 album \"2001\", experienced increases in streaming of 270 percent and 245 percent, respectively. In the end of the week, the album jumped back to the top 10 in \"Billboard\" 200 with 30,500 units sold, a 220% increase.\nAlso on Spotify, Mary J.

        "title": "Super Bowl LV halftime show",
        "text": "The Super Bowl LV halftime show, officially known as the Pepsi Super Bowl LV Halftime Show, was the halftime entertainment of Super Bowl LV, and took place on February 7, 2021, at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. It was headlined solely by Canadian singer-songwriter the Weeknd. The show was televised in the U.S. by CBS.\nBackground.\nOn November 12, 2020, the selection of the Weeknd to headline the show was announced, marking the first time a Canadian solo artist headlined the Super Bowl halftime show. The performance was initially rumored to last for 24 minutes, according to an interview the Weeknd had with \"Billboard\" on January 28, 2021. However, representatives for the singer-songwriter denied the rumor, stating that it would actually be \"roughly 12–13 minutes long\". When asked about preparations for the show, the Weeknd stated, \"We've been really focusing on dialing in on the fans at home and making performances a cinematic experience, and we want to do that with the Super Bowl.\" He contributed $7 million to the halftime performance.\nDevelopment.\nThe halftime show was executive produced by Dave Myers, Jesse Collins, Jay-Z and Roc Nation, who also served as the creative directors. The performance was directed by Hamish Hamilton, who has directed every Super Bowl halftime show since 2010. The Weeknd's band was directed by experimental electronic musician Oneohtrix Point Never.\nIn contrast to past years, the decision was made to build the stage within the stadium for the safety of workers and players, however the field was still used. The show also featured no guest performers, unlike many previous halftime shows. The stage was designed by Bruce Rodgers of Tribe, who has designed the stages for every Super Bowl halftime show since 2007. It was located beneath one of the stadium's video boards. 1,050 individuals worked on the show, a far lesser number than the 2,000 to 3,000 individuals that worked on previous halftime shows. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, preparations included regular COVID-19 testing, as well as social distancing in production trailers.\nSynopsis.\nThe performance featured a choir whose members were dressed in white and wore masks over their faces with glowing red eyes, and were standing within a backdrop of a neon cityscape. For the performance, the Weeknd wore a red blazer and black necktie. The outfit was designed by Givenchy and was embroidered with crystals.\nThe performance opened with a white figure dressed the same as the choir being lowered into the backdrop where the choir was standing while singing \"Call Out My Name\". At this time, the Weeknd sat in a convertible against a skyline backdrop designed to resemble the Las Vegas Strip. For the next part of the performance, the backdrop then split open to reveal the Weeknd, who then performed \"Starboy\", followed by \"The Hills\". Next, performing the song \"Can't Feel My Face\", the Weeknd traveled through a labyrinth constructed behind the stage, joined by dancers dressed in red blazers and black neckties similar to his, but with their faces covered with bandages, in keeping with the aesthetic of his fourth studio album \"After Hours\" (2020). The dancers would wear these bandages throughout the performance. In the labyrinth section of the performance, camerawork was visually unsteady. The next songs performed were \"I Feel It Coming\", \"Save Your Tears\", and \"Earned It\". For the \"Earned It\" performance, the Weeknd was accompanied by violinists.\nFor the finale of the show, the Weeknd took to the field of the stadium with his dancers to perform \"Blinding Lights\". He and the dancers entered the field by performing \"House of Balloons / Glass Table Girls\". The performance ended with an array of fireworks.\nCritical reception.\nThe halftime show received mixed reviews. Criticisms labeled the show as less spectacular, with no guest performers, and suffering from poor audio. Given the performance's mid-pandemic circumstances, several reviews pointed out this context would not allow for a more elaborate performance, but many complimented its production level.\nJon Caramanica of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the show was, \"sturdy, sometimes impressive\". Patrick Ryan of \"USA Today\" called the performance \"charismatic\". He called it a \"departure\" from the previous year's \"joyous performance\". He opined that it did not live up to some past halftime shows, such as the 2007 show performed by Prince and the 2013 show headlined by Beyoncé. However, he opined that it was a \"vast improvement\" over the 2011 show headlined by the Black Eyed Peas and the 2019 show headlined by Maroon 5. Writing that the show both \"dazzled\" and \"overwhelmed\", Larry Fitzmaurice of \"GQ\" wrote that the Weeknd \"didn't even come close to commanding the stage the way previous performers had\" at the Super Bowl. Jillian Mapes of \"Pitchfork\" called the performance \"a fever dream for the whole family\", writing that it was, \"goofy, celebratory, and even a little bit unsettling.\"\nNate Scott of \"For The Win\" gave the performance a lukewarm review, opining that while the performance was \"good\" and \"fine\", it \"wasn't great\". Scott criticized the camerawork featuring in the segment of the performance filmed inside of the labyrinth as, \"disorienting (and kind of nauseating).\" He also criticized the audio quality. Jim Harrington of \"The Mercury News\" wrote that the Weeknd's performance was \"solid, not super\". Craig Jenkins of \"Vulture\" wrote that \"the show delivered a vivid array of elaborate, expensive set pieces that hit the necessary notes for a halftime gig.\" While writing that he \"made a case for himself as a pop phenomenon with staying power\", Jenkins also opined that the Weeknd, \"highlighted some of the least-interesting moments in his catalog.\" Chuck Arnold of the \"New York Post\" wrote that the performance made it clear that the Weeknd is not yet the same caliber of a live performer as either Prince or Michael Jackson, both past halftime show performers. Arnold found that the highlight of the performance was the rendition of \"Blinding Lights\".\nSpencer Kornhaber of \"The Atlantic\" wrote, \"It's tempting to give the Weeknd points for edginess, but his commentary on emptiness is pretty empty\". Comparing his performance to past Super Bowl Halftime performers, Kornhaber wrote, \"When the time came to ascend the biggest stage in the world, Prince was raunchier, Madonna was ruder, Janet Jackson actually upset people, and Beyoncé forced a political confrontation. Moreover, those greats blended provocation with a risky sense of hope. The Weeknd's blank charm and eerie lighting feinted at meeting this bizarre moment in history but ultimately offered a shrug.\"\nIn a highly positive review, Dominic Patten of \"Deadline\" hailed the performance as a \"touchdown\", calling it a \"technical spectacle\". Rachel Brodsky of \"The Independent\" rated the performance four out of five stars, calling it \"slick\" and \"hyper-stylised\", praising it as a, \"brilliantly escapist 10 minutes that not only solidified his pop domination, but helped a deeply divided country – however briefly – dance away the pain of this past year.\" Lyndsey Parker of Yahoo! Entertainment called it, \"one of the most dazzling halftime shows in recent memory\", and wrote that it was on-par with the previous year's halftime show headlined by Shakira and Jennifer Lopez. Joe Riviera of \"Sporting News\" wrote, \"for the most part, the show was unique and high-energy\". Ed Masley of \"The Arizona Republic\" called the performance a, \"crowd-pleasing spectacle\", and opined that the absence of special guests did not hurt the performance, as such guests would have been unneeded. Mikael Wood of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called the performance, \"spooky yet darkly funny\" and an, \"appealingly bizarre spectacle reflected the COVID era in both mood and logistics\". AJ Romano of Vox called the performance \"mellow but satisfying\", writing that the Weeknd displayed, \"confidence and charm\". Giving the show four out of five stars, Adrian Horton of \"The Guardian\" wrote that the show was, \"a pleasingly middle ground performance – not outright explicit\" and praised the Weeknd for displaying \"impressive vocals and stamina\". Mark Savage of BBC opined that the Weeknd made the most of restrictions put in place due to the pandemic, delivering a, \"gimmick-free show that put the emphasis on his songs.\" Calling the halftime show \"disorienting\", but declaring that it, \"felt right\", Stephanie Hayes of the \"Tampa Bay Times\" wrote that the Weeknd \"vacillated between buoyant hits and unsettling imagery, striking a chord for these times.\" In a mostly positive review, Andrew Unterberger of \"Billboard\" called the Weeknd's performance a \"14-minute set that presented a pretty convincing argument for him having one of the strongest catalogs of any modern pop hitmaker\". Unterberger, however, did note that the performance had a, \"lack of truly stunning moments\".\nIn a negative review, Britt Julious of the \"Chicago Tribune\" called the performance \"an expensive nothing\". Julious derided the Weeknd as lacking in \"vocals, stage presence and charisma\", and opined that the Weeknd's \"body movements and awkward, pseudo-sensual hand gestures to the camera\" were \"uncomfortable\". Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press called the show boring, writing that he found the performance, \"limited and inadequate\". Fekadu criticized the decision to forgo musical guests. Fekadu wrote that the highlight of the performance was the rendition of \"Blinding Lights\". Bobby Olivier of NJ.com criticized the Weeknd for lacking in charisma, writing, \"he's just not a particularly dynamic live entertainer.\" Olivier also criticized the decision to forgo musical guests. Alex Suskind of \"Entertainment Weekly\" griped about the quality of the sound mixing and \"lack of tech-savvy pageantry\".\nSoon after the show took place, \"Vulture\" ranked the performance in the mid-tier of Super Bowl Halftime Shows since 1993. Similarly, Aaron Tallent of \"Athlon Sports\" soon after ranked it in the mid-tier of all Super Bowl Halftime Shows.\nImpact.\nToronto mayor John Tory declared February 7, 2021, as \"The Weeknd Day\" in celebration of the Weeknd's performance at the halftime show.\nIn the United States, the Super Bowl LV halftime show attracted 96.7 million viewers, slightly higher than the game itself, which was viewed by an average of 96.4 million television viewers. \nThe show had an immediate impact on the Weeknd's streaming figures, with MRC Data showing 48.9 million streams of his music catalog over the period of February 7–8 (the day of and day after the performance), a 42% increase in compared to the 34.5 million streams his catalog saw February 5–6. Combined, the eight songs performed at halftime, in addition to \"House of Balloons/Glass Table Girls\" (which saw a brief excerpt incorporated into the show), saw 23.8 million streams, a 51% increase over the combined 15.77 million these songs received February 5–6. His most-streamed song was \"Blinding Lights\", which saw 6.54 million streams (a 42% increase). His second-most streamed song was \"Save Your Tears\", which saw 6.19 million streams (a 23% increase). These two songs, combined, accounted for 26% of the Weeknd's streams in February 7–8. Of the other seven songs, \"The Hills\" saw 2.52 million streams (a 79% increase), \"Starboy\" saw 2.16 million streams (a 70% increase), \"Can't Feel My Face\" saw 1.69 million streams (a 83% increase), \"I Feel It Coming\" saw a 1.55 million increase (a 87% increase), \"Earned It\" saw 1.44 million streams (a 88% increase), \"Call Out My Name\" saw 1.25 million streams (a 46% increase), and \"House of Balloons/Glass Table Girls\" saw 465,000 streams (a 350% increase). \nIn addition to his streaming figures, the show also had an immediate commercial impact on the Weeknd's sales. Per \"Billboard\", the Weeknd's music sales increased 36,500 in combined sales of songs and albums on February 7, the day of the Super Bowl, an increase of 385% from the 7,500 sold on February 6. The increase of sales of songs was 454% (an increase to 32,500 from the 6,000 sold the previous day), and the increase of albums was 138% (an increase to 4,000 from the under 2,000 sold previous day). \"Billboard\" reported that most of his February 7 sales were in songs he had included in his halftime show setlist. The nine songs in the setlist sold a collective 29,000 downloads on February 7, compared to the 4,500 downloads they had sold the previous day. The best-performing song was \"Blinding Lights\", which accounted for 29% of his overall February 7 sales and 32% of his February song sales, selling 10,000 copies, an increase of 423% from the 2,000 copies it had sold the previous day. Of the eight other songs performed in the setlist, on February 7 \"Save Your Tears\" sold 4,000 copies (an increase of 245%), \"Can't Feel my Face\" sold 3,500 copies (an increase of 987%), \"Earned It\" sold 3,000 copies (an increase of 1,240%), \"Starboy\" sold 2,500 copies (a 1,175% increase), \"I Feel It Coming\" sold 2,500 copies (a 1,021% increase), and \"The Hills\" sold 2,000 (a 771% increase). His bestselling album on February 7 was \"The Highlights\", which sold 1,500 copies (an increase of 120%). The greatest hits album had been released two days before the halftime performance. His second-best-selling album on February 7 was his most recent studio album, \"After Hours\", which sold 1,000 copies (an increase of 67%).\nDocumentary.\nThe creation and preparations for the halftime show was featured in the documentary \"The Show\", directed by Nadia Hallgren. The documentary, which was produced by the halftime show sponsor Pepsi's in-house content studio and Boardwalk Pictures, aired on Showtime on September 24, 2021."

        "title": "Cycling in Madrid",
        "text": "The city of Madrid has been increasing in the last years its network of bicycle paths. In 2016, there were 195 km of cycling routes. The former city council had been planning to build 400 km more for the year 2024 despite a very vocal opposition to the construction of segregated infrastructure by a significant part of the local cycling community. However now with the new right wing mayor elected in 2019 the city is set to be the only capital in the world where bicycle lanes are being removed again.\nCycling by-laws.\nMadrid's cycling law was approved by the council of Madrid 5 October 2018. This law introduced several changes in all the city of Madrid, some of them modifying the previous status of the bicycle. The most important changes were:\nInfrastructure.\nIn Spain's Spanish, all kind of bicycle infrastructure segregated from cars are called informally \"carril bici\", which means bicycle lane. The Madrid's sustainable mobility law defines 8 types of bicycle ways.\nNevertheless, other argue that there are up to 16 types of bikeways in Madrid.\nShared lanes.\nCar-shared lanes are lanes marked with shared-lane markings or sharrows. In Spanish there are called \"ciclocarril\". This kind of infrastructure is marked with the drawing of a bicycle on the pavement and two \"corporal\" arrows (chevrons) that spans all the width of the lane. This is by far the most usual kind of infrastructure that can be found in Madrid and defining of the character or cycling in the city. This lane has a speed limit of 30 km/h (20 mph) and is marked on the road, except in one lane streets, because in Madrid street with only one lane in a direction are de facto limited to 30 km/h(18 mph).\nSidewalk cycle-path.\nThis is a bicycle path at the same level of the sidewalk. In Spanish is called \"acera-bici\". This means that the segregation between pedestrians and cyclists doesn't exist or there is a difference of less than 3 cm(1.18 in) between the height of the cycleway and the pavement. In this kind of infrastructure, cyclists must yield to pedestrians when crossing transversely the cycleway. There is a speed limit of 10 km/h(6 mph) to cyclist. Examples of sidewalk cycle-paths can be found in O'Donnell Street or Serrano Street.\nBicycle lane.\nThis is a lane of the road that can be only used by bicycles. In Spanish is called \"carril-bici\". It can have rumble strips as lane line. Examples of this type of infrastructure can be found at Toledo Street, Alcalá Street, Mayor Street, Oporto Avenue or Mayorazgo Avenue. There are also some bicycle lanes that run between a bus lane and other lanes, as in Carranza Street, Atocha Street or Gran Vía.\nProtected bicycle lane.\nThis is also a lane of the road than can be only used by bicycle, but is protected with parked vehicles, bollards, kerbs or armadillos. It is called \"carril-bici protegido\" in Spanish. This bicycle infrastructure can be found in Santa Engracia Street, Camino de los Vinateros, Chopera Promenade or Francisco Largo Caballero Street.\nShared-use paths.\nShared-use paths, which are calle \"senda-bici\" in Spanish, are ways for pedestrians and cycles that run through open spaces, parks, gardens or forests, separated from road with motorized traffic. In those paths pedestrians have always priority and cyclists have a speed limit of 20 km/h(12 mph). Usually, if not marked by a sign, all parks with paved paths of more than 3m(9 ft 10in) are considered shared use paths. If there are a lot of crowding and no separation between bicycles and pedestrians, maximum speed will be 5 km/h(3 mph). In forest zones and suburban parks, bicycles can ride through inner paths.\nThe most important shared-use path is Madrid Río, a park located in the banks of the Manzanares River and opened in 2011.\nCycle street.\nA cycle street is a street exclusive or preferential for bicycles in both ways. If other vehicles can access to this street, they must be explicitly authorized by a signal. As of 2019, the only cycle street in Madrid is at Puerta del Sol.\nBicycle path.\nA bicycle path are a cycleway that has its own platform, segregated both from the road and the pavement. This is called in Spanish \"pista bici\". This segregations must be accomplished by a 3 cm(1.18 in) difference in height between the pavement and the cycleway (the law doesn't say anything about the difference in height between the road and the cycleway) or by a continuous segregation. Some examples of bicycle paths are in some sections of the Complutense Avenue, in some sections of Anillo Verde Ciclista and in the Juan Antonio Vallejo-Nájera Botas Promenade.\nAdvanced stop lights.\nAdvances stop line are road markings near junction lights with the pictogram of a bicycle and a motorbike. Both cyclists and motorcyclists may use it. Advanced stop lines in Madrid doesn't have a feeder lane, so cyclists have to filter through cars in order to arrive there. However, if there is a bus lane, it is allowed to cyclists to use it to arrive at the front.\nBiciMAD.\nBiciMAD is a public service of bicycle-sharing. It began operations in 2014 and it comprises with 123 stations and 1580 bicycles.\nBicycle Racing.\nLa Vuelta a España, Spain's most popular cycling competition, always ends in Madrid.\n\"Anillo Verde Ciclista\".\nThe \"Anillo Verde Ciclista\" (Cyclist Green Ring) is a bikeway that surrounds the city of Madrid. It is 64 kilometres long, and the average time to go across it is 4 hours and a half. It was built by phases, between the year 1995 and 2007.\n\"Madrid Río\".\n\"Madrid Río\" (literally: Madrid River) is a park located in the banks of the Manzanares River. It opened in 2011, and it is crossed by a cycle route shared with pedestrians."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career fielding errors as a left fielder leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, an error is an act, in the judgment of the official scorer, of a fielder misplaying a ball in a manner that allows a batter or baserunner to advance one or more bases or allows an at bat to continue after the batter should have been put out. The left fielder (LF) is one of the three outfielders, the defensive positions in baseball farthest from the batter. Left field is the area of the outfield to the left of a person standing at home plate and facing toward the pitcher's mound. The outfielders' duty is to try to catch long fly balls before they hit the ground or to quickly catch or retrieve and return to the infield any other balls entering the outfield. The left fielder must also be adept at navigating the area of left field where the foul line approaches the corner of the playing field and the walls of the seating areas. Being the outfielder closest to third base, the left fielder generally does not have to throw as far as the other outfielders to throw out runners advancing around the bases, so they often do not have the strongest throwing arm, but their throws need to be accurate. The left fielder normally plays behind the third baseman and shortstop, who play in or near the infield; unlike catchers and most infielders (excepting first basemen), who are virtually exclusively right-handed, left fielders can be either right- or left-handed. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the left fielder is assigned the number 7.\nThe list of career leaders is dominated by players from the early 20th century; only two of the top 16 players were active after 1945. Only four of the top 28 single-season totals were recorded after 1916, none after 1935; only four of the top 81 totals were recorded after 1940. To a large extent, the leaders reflect longevity rather than lower skill. Barry Bonds, whose 89 errors are the most by a National League (NL) left fielder since 1971, won eight Gold Glove Awards for defensive excellence.\nBecause game accounts and box scores often did not distinguish between the outfield positions, there has been some difficulty in determining precise defensive statistics prior to 1901; because of this, and because of the similarity in their roles, defensive statistics for the three positions are frequently combined. Although efforts to distinguish between the three positions regarding games played during this period and reconstruct the separate totals have been largely successful, separate error totals are unavailable; players whose totals are missing the figures for pre-1901 games are notated in the table below. Zack Wheat, who held the major league records for career games and putouts in left field for over 70 years, is the modern (post-1900) leader in career errors committed by a left fielder with 186, including the modern National League record of 184. Goose Goslin (184), Lou Brock (168), Bobby Veach (146), Jimmy Sheckard (139), Patsy Dougherty (133), Duffy Lewis (123), Bob Johnson (121), Jack Graney (114), Rickey Henderson (113), Ken Williams (109), Jesse Burkett (108), and Charlie Jamieson (103) are the only other left fielders charged with over 100 career errors after 1900. Justin Upton, who had 39 errors through the 2022 season to place him tied for 112th all-time, is the leader among active players."

        "title": "Equestrian statue of Ferdinand Foch, London",
        "text": "The equestrian statue of Ferdinand Foch stands in Lower Grosvenor Gardens, London. The sculptor was Georges Malissard and the statue is a replica of another raised in Cassel, France. Foch, appointed Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces on the Western Front in the Spring of 1918, was widely seen as the architect of Germany's ultimate defeat and surrender in November 1918. Among many other honours, he was made an honorary Field marshal in the British Army, the only French military commander to receive such a distinction. Following Foch's death in March 1929, a campaign was launched to erect a statue in London in his memory. The Foch Memorial Committee chose Malissard as the sculptor, who produced a replica of his 1928 statue of Foch at Cassel. The statue was unveiled by the Prince of Wales on 5 June 1930. Designated a Grade II listed structure in 1958, the statue's status was raised to Grade II* in 2016.\nHistory.\nFerdinand Foch (1851–1929) began his military career as an enlisted soldier in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. Gaining rapid promotion in the First World War, in March 1918 he was appointed Supreme Allied Commander of all the allied forces on the Western Front. The following months saw increasing allied success, and final German defeat, which Foch's great patron, the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, among others, attributed primarily to Foch's strategic direction.\nIn November 1918, Foch accepted the German surrender and signed the Armistice of 11 November 1918 on behalf of the Allied nations in a railway carriage in the Forest of Compiegne.\nFoch was the recipient of many French and foreign honours; among these the British government awarded him the Order of Merit and made him an honorary Field marshal. Following Foch's death in March 1929, the British civil servant, Lord Askwith established the Foch Memorial Committee to plan and fund a permanent memorial. The French sculptor Georges Malissard was approached and agreed to cast a replica of an earlier equestrian statue he had created of Foch in the French town of Cassel. The choice of a copy of a French statue by a French sculptor was not without controversy; the President of the Royal British Society of Sculptors wrote to \"The Times\" to complain, and the Chair of the Royal Fine Art Commission, Lord Crawford, privately described the final design as \"a very poor and commonplace thing\". Nevertheless, the Memorial Committee pressed ahead, partly due to underfunding of the project and the relatively cheap cost of the replica. The final cost of the statue was £5000.\nThe statue was originally intended to stand at the northern end of Grosvenor Gardens, but Malissard insisted on a more southerly situation as the statue would then be seen by French visitors arriving at Victoria Station, the London terminus for the prestigious cross-channel boat trains. The memorial was unveiled by Edward, Prince of Wales, on 5 June 1930 at a ceremony also attended by Lloyd George, Admiral Lord Jellicoe and an array of British and French senior military officers.\nCommemorative ceremonies held at the statue include a rededication in November 2014, and a ceremony held on 26 March 2018 to commemorate the centenary of the appointment of Foch as Supreme Allied Commander on the Western Front.\nArchitecture and description.\nThe sculpture was designed by Georges Malissard and the plinth by the architect Paul Lebret. The statue is of bronze and is 3.2m high, while the 3.85m high pedestal is of Portland stone. Foch is depicted in service uniform, astride a horse. The plinth has three inscriptions: the front reading \"\"Foch\" and giving the dates of his birth and death; the one on the right reading; \"I am conscious of having served England as I served my own country\"\"; and that at the back recording Foch's most senior ranks and decorations. The statue's setting was redesigned as a garden in the French style after the Second World War and dedicated to Foch's memory in 1952. The cost was borne by the Government of France. Pevsner records the \"dear little shell and pebbledash lodges\".\nIn 1958, the statue was designated a Grade II listed structure, a designation that was raised to Grade II* in 2016. The listing records the statue's historic and sculptural value, as well as its contribution to the overall setting of Grosvenor Gardens."

        "text": "Ed Pinkham (born September 6, 1953) is an American college football coach who was most recently the defensive pass game coordinator for the Arkansas State Red Wolves. He is a former American college football player for the Allegheny Gators and a native of Clark, New Jersey.\nPlaying career.\nPinkham started playing football in his youth. He played at Arthur L. Johnson High School. In college, he played for the Allegheny Gators from 1971 to 1974 on defense and special teams. As a defender, he posted 14 career interceptions (a second all-time in program history), including a PAC-leading six picks as a freshman in 1971. Pinkham averaged 22.9 yards per kick return, scoring two touchdowns over his career, and 13.8 yards per return with three touchdowns on punt returns. His two punt return touchdowns in a single season ties him for the most in Allegheny history.\nCoaching career.\nEarly years (1975 to 2007).\nEd Pinkham has been coaching for over 40 years, 30 years of which were spent at the defensive coordinator position.\nIn 1989, he became a secondary coach for the University of Minnesota's Golden Gophers. While there, Pinkham oversaw the outside linebackers, before moving over to the secondary. He was also the secondary coach and defensive coordinator for nearly twelve years at the University of New Hampshire. At the College of the Holy Cross, Pinkham was defensive coordinator and associate head coach for a total of four seasons. Pinkham was also the defensive coordinator for Colgate from 1996 through 2008. The Raiders captured five Patriot League titles during Pinkham's tenure at Colgate, and earned five trips to the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision playoffs. Pinkham's defensive unit was the leader for the Patriot League's total defense stats in 1999, 2003, 2004 and 2006, and three times paced the league in rushing defense.\nReturn to division one (2008 to 2012).\nPinkham returned to the Football Championship Subdivision level at Elon, where his defense rated third nationally against the pass, allowing an average of just 153.55 yards per game through the air. Pinkham's Phoenix defense accumulated 17 sacks, topping its previous season total by four. Pinkham would serve in the same capacity at Rutgers from 2009 to 2010. During Pinkham's first season as co-defensive coordinator, he helped Rutgers defense pursue great feats, as the Scarlet Knights ranked in the top-20 in five categories, including leading the nation in tackles for loss and ranking second in turnover rate. Under Pinkham, Rutgers was 15th in the country in rushing defense, 16th in scoring defense and 18th in total defense.\nWestern Michigan University (2013 to 2017).\nWhen Pinkham coached at Western Michigan University, the team had the third-ranked scoring defense in the Mid-American Conference at 25 points per game and second in total defense at 371 yards per game. They ranked 15th nationally in scoring defense (19.8 points per game), 26th in total defense (353.6 yards per game) and tied for first in turnover margin (plus-18), and helped lead the team to a 13–0 season.\nRevival of UMass (2017 to 2018).\nPinkham begin coaching at UMass in 2017 as their new defensive coordinator. The team went 4–8 in 2017, their best record in five years. Pinkham has received good reviews both from his players and outside observers for helping to turn the Minutemen around. His time at UMass saw the program record its most wins in back-to-back seasons in its seven-year history as an FBS member, while also collecting its first win over a team from one of the power-five conferences.\nToday (2019 to present).\nPinkham entered his first season as the Red Wolves’ interior defensive line coach in 2019. He was released on October 16, 2020. He coached for the Alphas in The Spring League in 2021.\nBowl games.\nEd Pinkham has coached in a bowl game six times over the course of his career, with a 4–2 record."

Athletes qualified for this event by having met the A qualification standard, which meant having 140 or less FIS Points and being ranked in the top 500 in the Olympic FIS points list or meeting the B standard, which meant 140 or less FIS points. Countries not meeting the A standard were allowed to enter a maximum of one B standard athlete per gender. \nThe Points list takes into average the best results of athletes per discipline during the qualification period (July 1, 2016 to January 21, 2018). Countries received additional quotas by having athletes ranked in the top 30 of the 2017–18 FIS Alpine Ski World Cup (two per gender maximum, overall across all events). After the distribution of B standard quotas (to nations competing only in the slalom and giant slalom events), the remaining quotas were distributed using the Olympic FIS Points list, with each athlete only counting once for qualification purposes. A country could only enter a maximum of four athletes for the event.\nResults.\nThe race was started at 10:00 (Run 1) and 13:45 (Run 2)."

The field consisted of the top 60 finishers in the sprint event, held two days earlier, with competitors' starting times dependent on their final time in the sprint event. Laura Dahlmeier, who was the champion in the sprint, won a second title, becoming the first female biathlete to win an Olympic sprint-pursuit double. Anastasiya Kuzmina finished second, and Anaïs Bescond was third. This was Bescond's first Olympic medal.\nSummary.\nDahlmeier started first, and hit all targets at her first prone shoots. The sprint silver medallist Marte Olsbu missed a target, and between the prone shoots Dalmeier was followed by Veronika Vítková and Anastasiya Kuzmina, who overtook Vítková, and by the second prone shoot closed the gap to Dahlmeier by 10 seconds. Dahlmeier, Kuzmina, and Vítková all missed a target at the second prone shoot, and Anaïs Bescond and Irene Cadurisch, who did not miss, came into contention. By 5 km, Kuzmina was leading, with Dahlmeier 0.7 seconds behind her, followed by Bescond and Cadurisch half a minute behind. In the first standing shoot, Kuzmina missed two targets, Bescond missed one, and Cadurisch missed three and dropped out of medal contention.

        "text": "The 2018 Vuelta a España was a three-week Grand Tour cycling stage race that took place in Spain between 25 August and 16 September 2018. The race was the 73rd edition of the Vuelta a España and was the final Grand Tour of the 2018 cycling season. The race started in Málaga and finished in Madrid.\nThe race was won by British rider Simon Yates from the team .\nTeams.\nThe starting teams include:\nPre-race favourites.\nFour former winners started the race; Nairo Quintana, Alejandro Valverde (both from ), Vincenzo Nibali () and Fabio Aru (). The other riders considered contenders for the general classification were Richie Porte (), Simon Yates (), Miguel Ángel López (), Michał Kwiatkowski (), Wilco Kelderman (), Steven Kruijswijk (), Thibaut Pinot () and Rigoberto Urán ().\nClassification leadership.\nThe Vuelta a España had four individual classifications, for which jerseys were awarded daily to the leading rider, as well as a team competition. The primary classification was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses were awarded at the end of every stage apart from the two individual time trials. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the leader of the general classification, and wears the red jersey. The leader of the general classification at the end of the race was considered the overall winner of the Vuelta a España.\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing among the highest placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type. The leader was identified by a green jersey.\nThe next classification was the mountains classification. Points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit of the most difficult climbs first. The climbs were categorized, in order of increasing difficulty, third-, second-, and first- and special-category. The leader wore a white jersey with blue polka dots.\nThe final of the individual classifications was the combination classification. A rider's ranking in the combination classification was determined by tallying up his positions in the general, points, and mountains classifications. The leader wore a white jersey. If no rider was classified in all three classifications, riders classified in two would have been considered, and if that was tied the general classification will decide the winner.\nThere was also the team classification. After each stage, the times of the three highest finishers of each team are added together. The victory was awarded to the team with the lowest cumulative time at the end of the event.\nIn addition, there were two individual awards: the combativity award and the young rider award. The combativity award was given after each stage to the rider \"who displayed the most generous\neffort and best sporting spirit.\" The daily winner wore a green number bib the following stage. At the end of the Vuelta, a jury decides the top three riders for the \"Most Combative Rider of La Vuelta\", with a public vote deciding the victor. The young rider award is calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1993. The leader wore a red number bib.\nA total of €1,120,000 will be awarded in cash prizes in the race. The overall winner of the general classification will receive €150,335, with the second and third placed riders getting €57,000 and €30,000 respectively. All finishers in the top 20 were awarded with money. The holders of the four individual classifications benefited on each stage they led. The final winners of the points and combined were given €11,000, while the mountains classification got €23,100 and the most combative rider got €3,000. The team classification winners were given €12,500. €11,000 was given to the winners of each stage of the race, with smaller amounts given to places 2–20. There was also a special award with a prize of €1,000, the Cima Alberto Fernández, given to first rider to reach the summit of the highest mountain of the race."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career fielding errors as a second baseman leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, an error is an act, in the judgment of the official scorer, of a fielder misplaying a ball in a manner that allows a batter or baserunner to advance one or more bases or allows an at bat to continue after the batter should have been put out. In baseball and softball, the second baseman is a fielding position in the infield, commonly stationed between second and first base. The second baseman often possesses quick hands and feet, needs the ability to get rid of the ball quickly, and must be able to make the pivot on a double play. In addition, second basemen are almost always right-handed. Only four left-handed throwing players have appeared as second basemen in the major leagues since 1950; one of the four, Gonzalo Márquez, was listed as the second baseman in the starting lineup for two games in 1973, batting in the first inning, but was replaced before his team took the field on defense, and none of the other three players lasted even a complete inning at the position. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the second baseman is assigned the number 4.\nThe list of career leaders is dominated by players from the 19th century, when fielding equipment was very rudimentary; baseball gloves only began to steadily gain acceptance in the 1880s, and were not uniformly worn until the mid-1890s, resulting in a much lower frequency of defensive miscues. All but three of the top 21 players in career errors began playing in the 19th century – including the top 13, ten of whom played their entire careers before 1900; only one of the top 21 played more than two games after 1920. None of the top 25 were active after 1930, with the top eight players active after 1926 all being members of the Baseball Hall of Fame; none of the top 49, and only eight of the top 77, were active after 1953. The top 59 single-season totals were all recorded before 1895, the top 192 were recorded before 1928, and the top 410 were recorded before 1946. To a large extent, the leaders reflect longevity rather than lower skill. Joe Morgan, whose 244 errors are the most by any second baseman since 1945, won five Gold Glove Awards for defensive excellence.\nFred Pfeffer, who retired in 1897 after having set National League (NL) records for career games, putouts and assists as a second baseman, is the all-time leader in career errors as a second baseman with 857 – nearly twice as many as any player whose career began after 1900, and over three times as many as any player who reached the major leagues after 1930; he is the only second baseman with over 800, and also holds the NL record of 781. Bid McPhee (792) and Cub Stricker (701), whose careers ended in 1899 and 1893 respectively, are the only other second basemen to commit more than 700 career errors. Robinson Canó, who had 124 errors through the 2021 season to place him tied for 144th all-time, is the leader among active players."

        "text": "The Chess World Cup 2019 was a 128-player single-elimination chess tournament that took place in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia, from 9 September to 4 October 2019. It was won by Azerbaijani grandmaster Teimour Radjabov. He and the runner-up, Ding Liren, both qualified for the Candidates Tournament for the World Chess Championship 2021. It was the 8th edition of the Chess World Cup.\nLevon Aronian, the winner of the Chess World Cup 2017, advanced to the quarterfinals before being eliminated by Maxime Vachier-Lagrave on tiebreaks. Vachier-Lagrave was eliminated by Radjabov in the semi-finals, but defeated Yu Yangyi to claim 3rd place.\nBidding process.\nThere was only one bid received for the combined FIDE World Cup and Olympiad events, which was done by the Yugra Chess Federation.\nFormat.\nThe tournament was a 7-round knockout event. The matches from round 1 to round 6 consisted of two classical games with a time control of 90 minutes per 40 moves plus 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with an increment of 30 seconds per move. The finals and the match for the third place consisted of four classical games.\nIf the score is tied after the classical games, rapid and, if necessary, blitz tiebreaks are played the next day. Two games are played with a time control of 25 minutes per game plus 10 seconds increment. In the case of a tie, they are followed by two games with a time control of 10 minutes per game plus 10 seconds increment. If the score is still tied, two blitz games follow (5 minutes plus 3 seconds increment). If the score is tied 4–4 after all these games, a single \"Armageddon\" game is played: the player who wins the drawing of lots may choose the colour; White has 5 minutes per game and Black has 4 minutes, with an increment of 2 seconds per move starting from move 61, and White needs a win to advance to the next round; Black advances if they win or the game is drawn.\nThe two top finishers qualified for the 2020 Candidates Tournament. The rules in fact specified that it would be the top two finishers other than Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana, because Carlsen as World Champion did not play in the Candidates, and Caruana had already qualified for the Candidates. The rule was introduced because the World Champion and the previous challenger unexpectedly signed up for the previous edition Chess World Cup 2017. This time, though, Carlsen and Caruana both declined their invitations to the World Cup, so the qualifiers are simply the two finalists.\nSchedule.\nEach of the first six rounds took three days: one day each for the two regular time limit games and then a third day for tiebreaks, if required. The final round has four days of regular time limit games and then a fifth day for tiebreaks, if required.\nPrize money.\nThe total prize fund was US$1,600,000, with the first prize of US$110,000.\nParticipants.\nThe participants were seeded by their FIDE rating of August 2019. All players are grandmasters unless indicated otherwise."

        "title": "2019 FIFA Women's World Cup final",
        "text": "The 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup final was an association football match which determined the winner of the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. It was the eighth final of the FIFA Women's World Cup, a quadrennial tournament contested by the women's national teams of the member associations of FIFA. The match was played on 7 July 2019 at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais in Décines-Charpieu, a suburb of Lyon, France.\nThe final was contested by the United States, the defending champion, and the Netherlands, in their first final. The United States won 2–0, earning their second consecutive and fourth overall Women's World Cup title, with second-half goals scored by co-captain Megan Rapinoe (from the penalty spot) and Rose Lavelle. With their victory, the U.S. joined Germany as the second team to win consecutive titles. The team's coach, Jill Ellis, became the first manager to win two Women's World Cup titles, and also the first in 81 years since Vittorio Pozzo achieved this result in the 1934 and 1938 FIFA World Cups with Italy men's team.\nEach finalist was the reigning champion of their own respective confederation, with the U.S. having won the 2018 CONCACAF Women's Championship and the Netherlands having won UEFA Women's Euro 2017.\nVenue.\nThe final was held at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais in Décines-Charpieu, a suburb of Lyon. During the tournament, the stadium was referred to as the Stade de Lyon by FIFA. The venue has a seating capacity of 57,900, and hosted both semi-final matches. The stadium was announced as the final venue when France was confirmed as host on 19 March 2015, with the stadium officially confirmed to host the semi-finals and final in September 2017. The stadium is home venue of Ligue 1 club Lyon, opening in January 2016 to replace their previous stadium, the Stade de Gerland. It has also hosted several UEFA Women's Champions League matches for the club's women's side, which is the most successful in European history.\nIn 2008, the project for the new stadium was agreed upon by the government and commune of Décines. Stadium construction started in mid 2013, and finished in late 2015 at a cost of €450 million. The stadium was chosen as a venue for UEFA Euro 2016, where it hosted six matches. The stadium also hosted the 2017 Coupe de la Ligue Final and 2018 UEFA Europa League Final. Outside of football, the Parc Olympique Lyonnais has hosted several musical performances, as well as ice hockey and rugby union matches, including the Rugby Champions Cup and Rugby Challenge Cup finals of 2016. The stadium is planned to host matches for the 2023 Rugby World Cup and the men and women's football tournaments at the 2024 Summer Olympics.\nBackground.\nFor the first time since 2007, and fifth time overall (along with 1991, 1995 and 2003), the final featured a European team, as the continent took seven of the eight places in the quarter-finals. The previous two finals were contested by Japan and the United States. The match was the first final since 1991 to feature a North American side against a European side. The match was also the first final of a women's or men's World Cup to feature the defending champions against the reigning European champions.\nThe match was a record-extending fifth Women's World Cup final for the United States, who were the defending champions and record winners of the competition with three titles. They won the inaugural final in 1991 against Norway, before winning their second title in 1999 as hosts via a penalty shoot-out victory against China PR. They made their next appearance in the 2011 final, losing on penalties to Japan, before securing their third title in the 2015 rematch against Japan. In the previous seven editions of the tournament, the U.S. never finished outside of the top three. The fixture was the third consecutive appearance in the final for the United States, setting a competition record.\nJill Ellis became the third manager to reach two Women's World Cup finals, after Even Pellerud for Norway (in 1991 and 1995) and Norio Sasaki for Japan (in 2011 and 2015), both with one win and one loss in the final. With her counterpart Sarina Wiegman, the match was the second final in which both teams have a female coach, after the 2003 matchup between Tina Theune of Germany and Marika Domanski-Lyfors of Sweden.\nThe match was the first Women's World Cup final for the Netherlands in their second tournament appearance. They were the fourth European country (after Germany, Norway and Sweden) and eighth overall to reach a Women's World Cup final, and the first new finalist since Japan in 2011. In the Netherlands only prior tournament appearance, in 2015, they were eliminated in the round of 16 by defending champions and eventual runners-up Japan.\nThe match was the eighth meeting between the United States and the Netherlands, and the first competitive fixture as all prior matches were friendlies. The sides first met in 1991, which the Netherlands won 4–3, but the U.S. won all six subsequent meetings, most recently a 3–1 win in September 2016.\nRoute to the final.\nUnited States.\nThe United States is the most successful team in women's football, having won three Women's World Cups in four previous final appearances and four Olympic gold medals. The team had never finished below third place in all eight editions of the World Cup. Jill Ellis was appointed as interim head coach of the team in 2014, following the firing of Tom Sermanni between major tournaments, and oversaw qualification for the 2015 World Cup using a core inherited from earlier cycles. The United States had reached their second consecutive final in 2015, playing in a rematch of the 2011 final in which they had lost to Japan. The Americans won 5–2, including a first-half hat-trick by Carli Lloyd, to secure their third Women's World Cup title—their first since 1999. Following an early quarter-final exit at the 2016 Olympics, Ellis adjusted the team's usual formation and adopted a 4–3–3 with an emphasis on faster play under the direction of new call-ups. The United States qualified for the 2019 Women's World Cup by winning the 2018 CONCACAF Women's Championship, outscoring their opponents 26–0 and defeating Canada in the final.\nThe U.S. team, entering the tournament ranked first in the FIFA World Rankings, were drawn into Group F and opened their title defence with a 13–0 victory against Thailand, setting a new tournament record for largest margin of victory and goals in a match. Alex Morgan scored five goals, equalling a one-match record set by compatriot Michelle Akers in 1991, while four of her teammates scored their first World Cup goals in their debut at the tournament. The U.S. team were later criticised for celebrating their later goals during the match, with some media commentators and former players calling it disrespectful, but the celebrations were defended by other media commentators, the team's players and members of the opposing Thai bench. Ellis then fielded a squad of reserve players in a 3–0 win over debutants Chile, which included Carli Lloyd's pair of goals and a missed penalty kick. The U.S. closed out its group by winning 2–0 against Sweden, advancing with three shutout victories and outscoring opponents 18–0, a group stage record in the Women's World Cup.\nIn the round of 16, the U.S. played Group B runners-up Spain, who conceded an early penalty in the seventh minute that was converted by captain Megan Rapinoe. Spanish forward Jennifer Hermoso found an equaliser within three minutes after capitalising on a defensive error near the top of the box, shooting from distance to beat goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher and end her shutout streak. The U.S. were awarded a second penalty kick after a foul in the box on Rose Lavelle and won the match 2–1 on another conversion by Rapinoe in the 75th minute per instruction from Ellis, after Morgan initially looked set to take the kick. The Americans were then matched against hosts France, winners of Group A and a tournament favourite, in the quarter-finals. This was the first time the U.S. had faced the tournament hosts of the Women's World Cup. Rapinoe opened the scoring in the fifth minute, with a free kick that was driven low and through several players, and added a second in the 65th minute by finishing a cut-back cross from Tobin Heath in the box. French defender Wendie Renard scored a consolation goal in the 81st minute on a headed corner kick, but the U.S. held on to win 2–1 and eliminate the hosts.\nThe U.S. played England in the semi-finals, but were without Rapinoe due to a hamstring injury that kept her out of the starting line-up. Her replacement, Christen Press, scored the opening goal in the tenth minute on a header in the box; English forward Ellen White then volleyed a shot from inside the box in the 19th minute to earn her team an equaliser. Alex Morgan restored the U.S. lead in the 31st minute, the first player in Women's World Cup history to score on her birthday, finishing a cross by Lindsey Horan with a header that she celebrated with a controversial tea-sipping gesture. White scored an apparent second equaliser in the 67th minute, but was ruled offside by a video assistant referee (VAR) decision. A VAR decision in the 82nd minute determined that White was fouled in the penalty area by defender Becky Sauerbrunn and awarded a penalty to England. The resulting penalty was struck by captain Steph Houghton and saved by Alyssa Naeher, the first penalty save by a U.S. goalkeeper in the Women's World Cup outside of a shoot-out, ensuring a 2–1 victory for the United States. The U.S. reached their third consecutive Women's World Cup final by winning all six matches without trailing. Their semi-final win set a new tournament record for longest winning streak with eleven wins since 2015, as well as a record sixteen World Cup matches undefeated. They scored 24 goals en route to the final, including one in the opening twelve minutes of each match, coming close to the single-tournament record of 25.\nNetherlands.\nThe Netherlands, nicknamed the Oranje, first qualified for a major women's tournament in 2009, reaching the semi-finals of their first UEFA European Championship, and qualified for their first FIFA Women's World Cup in 2015. The team's rapid improvement in international competition was credited to the establishment of a professional club league in 2007 with investment from the Royal Dutch Football Association; the league later merged to form a combined Belgian–Dutch competition in 2012 and split again in 2015. In the 2015 Women's World Cup, the Dutch side finished third in their group with a 1–1–1 record and advanced to the round of 16, where they lost 2–1 to eventual runners-up Japan. The Netherlands hosted and won the 2017 European Championship, earning their first major international title with a dominating style implemented by interim manager Sarina Wiegman. The Dutch earned the last remaining European berth in the 2019 Women's World Cup by finishing second to Norway in its qualification group and winning the play-offs, defeating Denmark over two legs in the semi-finals and Switzerland in the finals.\nThe Dutch, ranked eighth in the FIFA World Rankings, were drawn into Group E with two of their 2015 group stage opponents, Canada and New Zealand, alongside Cameroon. Their opening match against New Zealand was scoreless until a last-minute header by substitute Jill Roord in stoppage time won it 1–0 for the Dutch. The Netherlands secured a knockout stage berth by defeating Cameroon 3–1 on the second matchday, with two goals by Vivianne Miedema to make her the nation's all-time top goalscorer. The Dutch finished with a three-win record and topped the group after winning 2–1 against Canada. An early penalty was rescinded by the VAR and the opening goal was scored by Dutch defender Anouk Dekker in the 54th minute. Christine Sinclair scored an equaliser six minutes later, but the Netherlands restored their lead in the 75th minute through a short-range finish by substitute Lineth Beerensteyn.\nThe round of 16 fixture for the Oranje was also a rematch against Japan, which manager Wiegman expected to end with a different result. Lieke Martens scored in the 17th minute with a backheel flick off a corner kick, but Japanese midfielder Yui Hasegawa equalised before half-time. The second half saw Japan creating more chances, with Dutch goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal crucially saving a shot from Yuka Momiki in the 80th minute to keep the scores level. In second-half stoppage time, the Dutch were awarded a controversial penalty kick by the VAR for a handball in the box by captain Saki Kumagai, which was then scored by Martens to win the match 2–1. The Netherlands defeated Italy 2–0 in the quarter-finals, also qualifying for the 2020 Olympics, through second-half headers scored by Miedema in the 70th minute and Stefanie van der Gragt ten minutes later. The match was played in heat and required several cooling breaks, which slowed the tempo of play.\nThe Netherlands reached their first Women's World Cup final by winning 1–0 in extra time against Sweden in the semi-finals. The match was scoreless in regulation time, due to the performances of both defences and goalkeepers, who made saves to keep several chances from breaking the deadlock. Jackie Groenen scored the lone goal of the match in the 99th minute, striking from to beat goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl, with her first shot on target during the tournament. The Dutch were the third reigning European champions to reach the final, following Germany in 2003 and 2007, and the first to play a non-European country in the final. The Netherlands also managed to reach the final without trailing in their six victories, conceding only once in the knockout stage but not leading at half-time in any of their matches.\nThe success of the Dutch side has brought national attention to the women's football program, including thousands of fans who travelled to France to attend matches and record television ratings reaching 5 million viewers for the semi-final.\nPre-match.\nScheduling.\nThe final's scheduling on 7 July led to a degree of criticism among supporters of women's football, as two continental men's tournament finals were held on the same day—the Copa América in Rio de Janeiro and the CONCACAF Gold Cup in Chicago. The latter final also featured the men's team of the United States. However, FIFA confirmed the Women's World Cup dates in September 2017, prior to the dates announced by CONMEBOL and CONCACAF.\nWhile FIFA called the scheduling a \"rare and exciting occurrence\", U.S. co-captain Megan Rapinoe criticised it as \"ridiculous and disappointing\". CONCACAF president Victor Montagliani said that the scheduling of the Gold Cup final had been the result of a \"clerical error\" and that the conflict was not realised until it was too late.\nMatch ball.\nThe official match ball for the final was the Adidas Tricolore 19, introduced for the knockout stage as a red-coloured variant of the Conext 19. The ball featured a blue-and-red glitch graphic, and pays homage to the original Adidas Tricolore, which was introduced for the men's 1998 FIFA World Cup, in which France were victorious for the first time while on home soil.\nOfficials.\nOn 5 July 2019, FIFA named French official Stéphanie Frappart as the referee for the final. Frappart had been a FIFA referee since 2009, and previously officiated at the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, 2016 Summer Olympics and UEFA Women's Euro 2017. In April 2019, she became the first woman to referee in Ligue 1, the top men's professional league in France. The final was Frappart's fourth match as referee during the tournament, having officiated two group stage matches and a quarter-final fixture. Her compatriot Manuela Nicolosi was chosen as one of the assistant referees, along with Irish official Michelle O'Neill. Claudia Umpiérrez of Uruguay was chosen as the fourth official, with her compatriot Luciana Mascaraña serving as the reserve assistant referee. Spaniard Carlos del Cerro Grande was named the video assistant referee, presiding over the first use of the technology in the final of the Women's World Cup. His fellow countryman José María Sánchez Martínez was named as one of the assistant video assistant referees for the match, along with Mariana de Almeida of Argentina.\nTeam selection.\nAmerican co-captain Megan Rapinoe, who scored five goals and had three assists during the tournament, was left out of the semi-final line-up against England due to a pulled hamstring. However, she said that she expected to return ahead of the final. U.S. midfielder Rose Lavelle also had to be substituted out in the semi-final due to a hamstring injury, though she also said that she was fit to play in the final.\nDutch winger Lieke Martens, winner of The Best FIFA Women's Player in 2017, was also listed as questionable due to a toe injury. She started in the semi-final against Sweden, previously a doubt for the match, though she was unable to make an impact and was substituted out at half-time. The team's goalkeeper, Sari van Veenendaal, finished the semi-final with a swollen hand, but returned to the starting line-up for the final.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe United States fielded their unusual 4–3–3 that was used by Jill Ellis during the tournament, including Megan Rapinoe, the U.S. captain for the match, after her injury that kept her from starting in the semi-final. Lieke Martens returned for the Netherlands side, while Shanice van de Sanden was placed on the bench. The match kicked off at 17:00 in heat, which was lower than the earlier forecasts for the ongoing continental heat wave. The match was attended by 57,900 spectators, including a large number of American fans and a stand of Dutch fans organised behind one of the goals. French president Emmanuel Macron, Dutch monarch Willem-Alexander, and several professional male and female footballers were also among those in attendance.\nThe United States started several attacks early in the match, but failed to score within the opening twelve minutes as they had in their previous six matches. The two sides traded fouls, including one that earned Sherida Spitse a yellow card in the tenth minute, but the U.S. remained in control of possession and had several chances towards goal. Dutch goalkeeper and captain Sari van Veenendaal made several saves to keep her shutout, including two shots before half-time from Sam Mewis and Alex Morgan. A foul on Rose Lavelle at the top of the penalty area was left uncalled, allowing the Dutch to spring a counterattack that ended with a foul on forward Lineth Beerensteyn by U.S. defender Abby Dahlkemper, who earned a yellow card. In first half stoppage time, U.S. defender Kelley O'Hara and Dutch winger Lieke Martens collided heads during an aerial challenge, resulting in O'Hara being substituted at half-time for Ali Krieger.\nAnother physical challenge, resulting in a bloody facial cut for U.S. defender Becky Sauerbrunn, began the second half as the U.S. continued to have the majority of attacking chances. Dutch defender Stefanie van der Gragt kicked U.S. attacker Alex Morgan in the shoulder while attempting to control the ball in the penalty area, which was left uncalled until a VAR review by referee Stéphanie Frappart awarded a penalty to the United States. Van der Gragt earned a yellow card and the penalty was scored in the 61st minute by U.S. captain Megan Rapinoe, who left Van Veenendaal standing on her line; the penalty was Rapinoe's sixth goal of the tournament, winning her the Golden Boot and making her the oldest player to score in a Women's World Cup final. Eight minutes later, Rose Lavelle scored the second goal of the final for the U.S. on a solo run through the Dutch defence that ended with a left-footed strike from .\nDown 2–0 and still conceding attacking chances to the U.S., the Netherlands substituted defender Anouk Dekker for forward Shanice van de Sanden and forced a save out of U.S. goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher. Van Veenendaal made several saves to deny a third goal for the United States after shots on target by Morgan, Tobin Heath, and Crystal Dunn. Rapinoe was substituted by Christen Press in the 79th minute, while Carli Lloyd was brought on in the last minutes of regulation time. After the end of the match, the U.S. bench spilled onto the field to celebrate the team's fourth Women's World Cup title.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Line-ups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Line-ups /&gt;\nMatch rules\nPost-match.\nThe United States won a record-extending fourth title, and became the second team to win consecutive editions of the Women's World Cup, following Germany in 2003 and 2007. The victory was also the first World Cup title on European soil for the U.S. During the 2019 tournament, the U.S. scored 26 goals to set a new record for most goals in a single Women's World Cup, surpassing the record of 25 shared by the U.S. in 1991 and Germany in 2003. The team's goal difference of +23 also set a new tournament record. Their World Cup unbeaten streak was also extended to 17 matches, including 12 consecutive wins. Jill Ellis became the first manager to win two Women's World Cup titles, amid criticism from fans over her style of management. On 10 July, the team were honoured with a ticker tape parade down the Canyon of Heroes in New York City and received their third Outstanding Team ESPY Award in Los Angeles.\nMegan Rapinoe was named the player of the match, and was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. She also won the Golden Boot as the top scorer of the tournament with six goals and three assists, while Alex Morgan won the Silver Boot with the same tallies; Rapinoe won the award on the second tie-breaker, having played fewer minutes. At the age of 34, Rapinoe became the oldest player to win the Golden Ball and Golden Boot awards. Rose Lavelle won the Bronze Ball award, while Dutch goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal won the Golden Glove award as the best goalkeeper of the tournament; her eight saves in the final were the most during any knockout stage match in the 2019 tournament.\nRapinoe became the second player to start in three Women's World Cup finals, after Birgit Prinz of Germany (1995, 2003 and 2007). Additionally, Tobin Heath, Ali Krieger, Carli Lloyd and Alex Morgan joined them as the only players to make an appearance in three finals. Rapinoe's goal made her the first player to convert a penalty outside of a shoot-out in a Women's World Cup final, as German goalkeeper Nadine Angerer saved the only previous final penalty taken by Marta of Brazil in 2007. The goal also meant that Rapinoe became the oldest player to score in a final, surpassing teammate Carli Lloyd who scored a hat-trick in the 2015 final at the age of 32 years and 354 days.\nThe United States will receive $4 million (3.5 million euros) in prize money as the winners of the tournament, while the Netherlands will receive $2.6 million (2.3 million euros) as runners-up. The U.S. team will also play a four-match victory tour that will entitle them to a share of profits, totalling approximately $250,000 per player. The monetary prizes, along with small bonuses from the United States Soccer Federation, were criticised as being unfair and discriminatory compared to those offered to men's teams; fans in the stadium chanted \"Equal pay!\" during FIFA president Gianni Infantino's appearance at the trophy ceremony alongside French president Emmanuel Macron. Several media personalities and sportspeople from the U.S. also mentioned the issue while congratulating the team on their victory. In response, Senator Joe Manchin introduced a bill in the U.S. Senate that would make equal pay for the women's team a requirement for federal funding for the 2026 men's World Cup, which is planned to be partially hosted by the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump, who had criticised Rapinoe's anthem protest and comments about rejecting a White House visit, also congratulated the team alongside former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.\nOn 30 July 2019, the United States Soccer Federation announced that head coach Jill Ellis would step down upon completion of the team's U.S. victory tour in October 2019. Following her departure, she will continue to work as an ambassador for U.S. Soccer.\nThe U.S. team was named the Athlete of the Year by \"Time\" magazine, while Rapinoe was awarded the Ballon d'Or Féminin and named the \"Sports Illustrated\" Sportsperson of the Year.\nBroadcasting.\nThe international broadcast of the match garnered an average of 82.18 million live viewers and 260 million total viewers, setting a new tournament record. The U.S. broadcast of the match on terrestrial television station Fox drew an average of 14.3 million, outranking the 2018 men's final (which did not feature the U.S.) but falling short of the 2015 Women's World Cup broadcast that was broadcast during U.S. prime time rather than late morning. An additional 1.6 million Americans watched the match on Telemundo in Spanish, and streaming audiences for Fox averaged 289,000 viewers.\nIn the Netherlands, the final was watched by 5.5 million people, an estimated 88 percent of people with television access. The Brazilian broadcast on TV Globo and its partners was watched by 19.9 million people (a 41.7 percent share), setting a new women's football record. Large audiences were also reported in France (5.9 million), Germany (5.1 million), Sweden (1.5 million) and the United Kingdom (3.2 million)."

        "title": "Michael Dickson (American football)",
        "text": "Michael Dickson (born 4 January 1996) is an Australian-born American football punter for the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Texas Longhorns and was selected by the Seahawks in the fifth round of the 2018 NFL draft. Regarded as one of the best punters in the league, his career punt average of 47.7 yards per punt ranks as the highest in NFL history.\nEarly years.\nBorn in Sydney, Dickson first played soccer in his youth before switching to Australian rules football at the age of 9. In his first year of playing Australian rules football, he earned the Golden Boot award for having the best kicking. He excelled in Australian football while playing for the University of New South Wales- Eastern Suburbs Bulldogs in the local Sydney AFL competition and was subsequently placed in the Sydney Swans talent academy as a teenager. He continued to play for UNSW-ES and the Swans reserves in the North East Australian Football League in an attempt to be drafted to a professional AFL team but was overlooked at the 2014 AFL draft. Dickson's Australian football career highlight occurred when he was chosen to play for the Swans in the 2014 NEAFL Grand Final. The Swans were defeated by a two-point margin in the final.\nIn 2015, at the age of 19, he moved to Melbourne to trial with Prokick Australia, a coaching program designed to help aspiring kickers and punters cross the Pacific and crack American football. Through his Prokick Australia experience, he was picked up by the University of Texas as a punter by head coach Charlie Strong.\nCollege career.\nIn his first season with the Longhorns, Dickson had 77 punts for 3,179 net yards for a 41.3 average in 2015. In the 2016 season, he had 65 punts for 3,079 net yards for a 47.4 average. In 2017, Dickson won the Ray Guy Award and was a unanimous All-American. Dickson was named MVP of the 2017 Texas Bowl. In his junior season, he had 84 punts for 3,984 net yards for a 47.4 average. In late December 2017, it was announced that Dickson would forgo his senior year at Texas in favor of the 2018 NFL draft.\nProfessional career.\nDickson was selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the fifth round, 149th overall, of the 2018 NFL draft. Dickson would go on to win the punting job, after the Seahawks released longtime veteran Jon Ryan during the preseason. He made his NFL debut in the Seahawks' season opener against the Denver Broncos. In the 27–24 loss, he had six punts for 354 net yards.\nDickson was named National Football Conference (NFC) Special Teams Player of the Week for his performance in Week 8 against the Detroit Lions. With minutes remaining at fourth-and-8 from their own three-yard line, Dickson was instructed to waste time in the end zone before giving up an intentional safety. Instead, after receiving the snap, he ran it nine yards for the first down, sealing the win. The unscripted play was later dubbed \"The Aussie Sweep.\" Dickson was named the NFC Special Teams Player of the Month for November 2018.\nDickson punted the ball 78 times for 3,759 yards in the 2018 season. His average of 48.2 yards per punt ranked as the second-highest in the league. In addition to punting, Dickson occasionally used the previously obscure drop kick maneuver on kickoffs for the Seahawks, both onside kicks and standard deep kicks. For his efforts, Dickson was voted into the 2019 Pro Bowl, the first rookie punter to participate since Dale Hatcher in 1985. In addition, Dickson was named as a first-team All-Pro.\nIn the 2019 season, Dickson had 74 punts for 3,341 yards, an average of 45.2 yards per punt.\nIn Week 2 of the 2020 season, against the New England Patriots on \"Sunday Night Football\", Dickson punted four times (50-yard average) with all four of them landing inside the 20-yard line during the 35–30 win. He would be named the NFC Special Teams Player of the Week for the performance. In Week 15 against the Washington Football Team, Dickson punted four times, all landing inside the 20-yard-line, earning another NFC Special Teams Player of the Week honor. During the 2020 season, Dickson punted 61 times for 3,028 yards, with his punting average of 49.6 yards being the second-highest in the league, and the 9th highest single-season average of all time.\nDickson signed a four-year, $14.5 million contract extension with the Seahawks on 4 June 2021.\nDuring Week 5 of the 2021 season, in a game against the Los Angeles Rams, Dickson initially had a punt blocked. He then chased down the football behind the line of scrimmage, picking it up with one hand, and punting it for a second time while on the run, reminiscent of Australian rules football. The punt would go for 68 yards, his longest of the season, and be downed on the Rams' 10-yard line. The \"double punt\" received national attention due to its relative obscurity, and is considered one of the most memorable special teams plays of all time.\nDickson punted the ball a career-high 83 times for 3,895 yards during the 2021 season, an average of 46.9 yards per punt. He pinned 40 punts inside the opponents' 20-yard line, the most in the league that season, and the 10th most in a single season in NFL history.\nIn the 2022 season, Dickson punted 66 times for a 48.47 net average."

He began his career playing for his local junior side Cronulla Caringbah at the age of sixteen. He was subsequently scouted and signed as a junior to the Cronulla Sharks.\nPlaying career.\nCronulla coach Jack Gibson gave Coleman his first grade debut against the Illawarra Steelers in round 22 of the 1986 season. In 1987, Coleman finished the season as the Sharks' top try scorer with 10 tries. In the 1988 season, the Sharks won the minor premiership for the first time in the club's history, Coleman played a starring role in his sides' success, playing in all 24 games, and scoring 8 tries. The Sharks narrowly missed out on Grand Final qualification that year when they lost 9–2 in the preliminary final to the Balmain Tigers at the Sydney Football Stadium.\nIn the 1989 season, the Sharks finished fifth after surviving a playoff for fifth with the Brisbane Broncos. Coleman once again played in all 24 games, and scored 6 tries in the 1989 season. Injuries in the 1990 and 1991 seasons prevented him from making much of an impact, but Coleman returned to top form in the 1992 season when he scored 8 tries from 21 appearances. Coleman's stint with the Sharks ended at the conclusion of the 1994 season and subsequently retired from playing.\nPost playing.\nAfter the 2005 Cronulla riots, Coleman was selected along with fellow sports stars Susie Maroney, Nick Davis, Mark Ella and former Sharks teammate Andrew Ettingshausen to head the $250,000 NSW government campaign to promote Sydney's beach suburbs as safe for everyone. In 2006, Coleman narrowly missed out on selection in the Cronulla Sharks Dream Team. Mat Rogers and Ray Corcoran were instead chosen as the wingers.\nIn 2013, Coleman briefly became the chairman of the Cronulla Sharks, but resigned from the position after only two months in the job. He was subsequently replaced by former Olympic basketballer Damian Keogh. Coleman now has a successful digital printing company Coleman Group as well as being a property developer. Coleman Group has been designing, printing and installing signage for over 60 years. As a leading manufacturer and supplier to the exhibition, event, retail and sporting industries"

        "title": "Drunken boxing",
        "text": "Drunken boxing () also known as Drunken Fist, is a general name for all styles of Chinese martial arts that imitate the movements of a drunk person. It is an ancient style and its origins are mainly traced back to the Buddhist and Daoist religious communities. The Buddhist style is related to the Shaolin temple while the Daoist style is based on the Daoist tale of the drunken Eight Immortals. Zui quan has the most unusual body movements among all styles of Chinese martial arts. Hitting, grappling, locking, dodging, feinting, ground and aerial fighting and all other sophisticated methods of combat are incorporated.\nHistory.\nDue to a scarcity of historical sources, it is nearly impossible to point to the time or place of drunken boxing's origin, nor to trace a credible lineage of teachers and students between drunken boxing's earlier documentation and present day practice. Drunken boxing probably appeared and disappeared in different places and at different times, with little more than common cultural and martial arts context to relate the different cases of drunken boxing with each other.\nWritten records.\nThe earliest written reference to drunken boxing is probably in the classic novel Water Margin, in which the Song Dynasty rebel Wu Song is depicted as a master of drunken boxing.\nIn the kung fu manual \"Boxing Classic\" () from the 18th century, \"Shàolín\" monks are described as practicing the style of eight drunken immortals boxing. This style is described as a technical derivative of \"dì tàng quán\".\nUnwritten records.\nThe \"Bā yǐng\" \"quán\" (八影拳) lineage from Henan attributes its wine boxing to the Shaolin Kung Fu style.\nHung Ga lineages stemming from Wong Fei Hung attribute their drunken boxing to So Chan.\nStyles.\nDrunken boxing is not a single martial art with an established lineage and hierarchy, but rather a group of loosely related kung fu styles. In this respect, drunken boxing could also be understood as a phenomenon within kung fu. Furthermore, drunken boxing rarely appears as a complete and independent system, but rather as an advanced feature within a broader system. A martial art may include a few drunken boxing techniques, one or more drunken boxing forms, a complementary drunken boxing fighting tactic, or a more developed drunken boxing sub-system. A great variety of kung fu schools have drunken styles, but the two major schools are the Buddhist and Daoist styles:\nBuddhist style.\nCreation of the Buddhist style of zui quan is attributed to Shaolin temple. At the beginning of the Tang dynasty (618-907 AD), 13 monks from the Shaolin temple intervened in a great war to help Li Shimin against rebel forces. The role of the monks was prominent so Li Shimin, as the next emperor, appreciated the monks' help and bestowed on them officialdom, land, and wealth. In ceremony of the victory, he sent the temple a gift of meat and wine. Because of the emperor's permission, the monks could abandon the Buddhist rule of not consuming meat and wine. This happened around 621 AD and since then, some Shaolin monks have consumed wine.\nAccording to some, the drunken style was first introduced in the Song dynasty (960-1279 AD). It is said that a famous martial artist named Liu Qizan accidentally killed a person and sought refuge in Shaolin to avoid trial and to repent. Despite his monastic vows, he still continued drinking wine. This was not tolerable by the monks and they wanted to expel him from the temple. While completely drunk after consuming a huge amount of wine, he defied and beat the monks, some say more than 30 monks. The abbot, after seeing this, praised his skill. This drunken style of combat was adopted from him by the monks and refined over the generations.\nThe most important Buddhist icons in Shaolin kung fu are Arhats, known in Chinese as Luohans. The same holds for the drunken style as a part of Shaolin kung fu, in which, the main character is the drunken luohan. Drunken luohan methods in Shaolin kung fu do not appear only in zui quan, but in some other styles as well. For example, in Shaolin luohan quan a drunken luohan steps forward, in Shaolin 18 luohan quan one of the 18 characters is a drunken luohan, and in Shaolin mad-devil staff a drunken luohan sways to the sides with disorderly steps.\nAs with other Shaolin styles, Shaolin zui quan is not a complete stand-alone system itself, but consists of a few barehanded and weapon forms which together with other forms and styles comprise the whole system of Shaolin quan. Every lineage of Shaolin monks may have one or two barehanded and one or a few weapon forms of zui quan. The main weapon is the drunken staff, but other weapons such as the drunken sword are also practiced. Though the technical contents are almost the same, the drunken forms of different lineages are different and their historical sources are mostly unclear.\nDaoist style.\nThe Daoist style of zui quan imitates the characters of the \"Drunken Eight Immortals\" (), which are a group of legendary immortals in Chinese mythology. First described in the Yuan Dynasty, they were probably named after the Eight Immortal Scholars of the Han. Most of them are said to have been born in the Tang or Song dynasty. They are revered by Daoists and are also a popular element in the secular Chinese culture. In drunken kung fu, the eight immortals are used as martial archetypes, or as eight sub-styles of drunken kung fu. Each immortal has his or her own strategy and mindset. This style is a complete system itself comprising 8 forms, each representing one of the eight immortal characters:\nThese elements combine to form a complete fighting art. This style has also several weapon forms. The main weapon is the drunken sword, but other weapons such as the staff are also used.\nOther styles.\nNorthern fist.\nThere are Northern and Southern versions of drunken monkey boxing, which is related to drunken boxing.\nTechnique.\nDrunken boxing is internal in nature, and emphasizes the role of jin. Movement is initiated in the dan tian area, and moves through the body distally towards the hands and feet. The musculature is kept as soft as possible.\nMovement in drunken boxing is relatively unique among martial arts in the frequency and degree in which it deviates from vertical posture, with the torso bent and twisted in all directions. The default hand position is the \"cup holding fist\", which is a softly held semi-open fist that uses the knuckles to strike and the tips of the fingers to grab. Other hand positions are used, too, among them the phoenix eye single knuckle fist.\nCombat.\nMany aspects of drunken boxing are specialized towards deception: continuous bobbing and weaving and slipping, feigning instability and lack of focus, attacking from unusual angles and seemingly weak positions, sudden changes of momentum, compounding multiple attacks with the same limb, use of blind-spots and visual distractions, changing game plans in mid-fight and employing concealed or improvised weapons.\nLike many styles of kung fu, drunken boxing employs a wide variety of attacks, including striking, chin na and wrestling, with trapping range fighting as a default skill. Strikes and grabs are alternated with the hands striking as they extend towards the enemy and grabbing as they retract. The power for grabs is sometimes generated by dropping the body, either through slightly lifting the feet off the ground and then stomping down with the weight of the entire body or by falling to the prone.\nSome styles of drunken boxing use traditional kung fu weapons, often the jian or gun. The \"Bā yǐng quán\" wine boxing system includes many weapons, including saber, spear, guan dao, flute, fan, gourd bottle, sash, sash tied to guard and more.\nReferences.\n27,^ Drunken Kung Fu - \"White Wine Form (Baijiu Quan)\" – Cyril Nolgrove CAMC (video)."

It was the 22nd running of the Dubai World Cup and the third running of the race since the synthetic Tapeta surface was replaced by a dirt track.\nThe winner was Juddmonte Farm's Arrogate, a four-year-old grey colt trained in the United States by Bob Baffert and ridden by Mike Smith. Arrogate's victory was the third in the race for Baffert after Silver Charm in 1998 and Captain Steve in 2001 and was the first in the race for his jockey and owner.\nThe contenders.\nThe race had a strong North American challenge headed by Arrogate, who had begun his 2017 campaign by winning the Travers Stakes in record time. The other runners from the United States were Gun Runner, Keen Ice, Hoppertunity (Clark Handicap, Jockey Club Gold Cup) and Neolithic. The United Arab Emirates was represented by Mubtaahij (UAE Derby), Move Up (Bosphorus Cup), Special Fighter (Al Maktoum Challenge, Round 3, 2016), Long River (Al Maktoum Challenge, Round 3, 2017) and the Chilean-bred mare Furia Cruzada (Al Maktoum Challenge, Round 2). The other four runners were the Japanese challengers Gold Dream (February Stakes), Awardee (JBC Classic), Apollo Kentucky (Tokyo Daishoten) and Lani (3rd in the Belmont Stakes).\nBetting is illegal in Dubai, but British bookmakers made Arrogate the 1/3 favourite ahead of Gun Runner on 7/1. The only other runners given any chance according to the betting were Hoppertunity, Move Up and Mubtaahij who started at 16/1.\nThe race.\nArrogate was hampered at the start and dropped back to the rear of the field. Long River set the early pace ahead of Gun Runner and Neolithic with Mubtaahij close behind. Few of the other runners were ever in contention. With half a mile left to run Gun Runner went to the front and Long River quickly dropped away. Gun Runner turned for home with a clear advantage but Arrogate produced a sustained run on the outside, took the lead 200 metres from the finish and drew away to win \"comfortably\" by two and a quarter lengths. Neolithic was five lengths away in third ahead of Mubtaahi, Awardee, Hoppertunity and Keen Ice with the other seven finishers trailing in at long intervals.\nWinner's details.\nFurther details of the winner, Arrogate"

In the second leg, Sweden (Charlotte Kalla) caught up with OAR (Yuliya Belorukova) and they skied together, but Norway (Astrid Uhrenholdt Jacobsen) dropped half a minute behind and was overtaken by Finland (Kerttu Niskanen), ten seconds behind the leaders. Switzerland (Nadine Fähndrich) was still fifth, but almost caught up with Norway. In the third leg, Norway (Ragnhild Haga) caught up with the leaders, Sweden (Ebba Andersson) and OAR (Anastasia Sedova). Finland was already 40 seconds behind, with other teams seemingly out of medal contention. In the last leg, Anna Nechaevskaya could not match the pace of the leaders, but Krista Pärmäkoski of Finland was not fast enough to make up forty seconds deficit, and OAR became third.

        "title": "The Hundred (cricket)",
        "text": "The Hundred is a 100-ball cricket tournament involving teams in major cities across England and Wales run by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) which took place for the first time in 2021.\nThe format was invented with the expectation that each match would last around two-and-a-half hours. The BBC showed free-to-air broadcasts of the competition, while all of the women's matches and some of the men's matches were available to stream for free on Sky Sports' YouTube channel.\nAlmost all matches take place as back-to-back double-headers at the same venue on the same day. One ticket gives access to both the men's and women's games. The men's salaries are four times higher than the women's, but the tournament prize money is equal.\nHistory.\nA new city-based cricket Twenty20 competition similar to the Indian Premier League was first proposed by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in September 2016. Following early discussions between the 18 first-class counties, the Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA) and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) they voted 16–3 in favour of developing the competition. On 26 April 2017, members of the ECB voted by 38–3 to push ahead with the new competition.\nThe idea of switching the competition from the established Twenty20 format to an entirely new type of cricket was first proposed by Sanjay Patel, the ECB's chief commercial officer, in a private October 2017 meeting with senior cricket officials. He argued that the hundred ball format would be simpler to understand for new audiences that the competition wants to attract.\nFormer England player and Northern Superchargers head coach Dani Hazell stated that the tournament would help with investment into the women's regional structure and the tournament would be an important learning experience for domestic players.\nThe tournament was delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe profitability of The Hundred has been a subject of debate. In 2016, a report produced by Deloitte had predicted the tournament would make about £27m profit per year. The ECB reported in 2022 that The Hundred had made an £11.8m profit. A report produced in 2023 by Fanos Hira, a chartered accountant, and assisted by ECB chairman Richard Thompson, showed a loss of £9m in its first two years. These figures do not include the £24.7m promised to the counties and Marylebone Cricket Club. The ECB's chief executive Richard Gould said he expected the tournament was \"here to stay\" beyond the current deal with Sky Sports, which runs until 2028.\nFor the third season of The Hundred, it was announced that the 100-ball cricket competition would be collaborating with Marvel Comics. A selection of Marvel's characters, such as Hulk, Iron Man and Black Panther featured in digital content with players from across all eight teams to introduce the competition to new audiences.\nFormat.\nOne-hundred-ball cricket is a form of limited overs cricket, played by two teams each playing a single innings made up of 100 balls. Games last approximately two and a half hours.\nThe Laws of Cricket apply in The Hundred, with major exceptions:\nTournament structure.\nEight city-based teams compete during the school summer holidays. All men's and women's matches are held on the same day at the same grounds. In total there are 32 matches in the league stage of the tournament. Each team plays four matches at home and four matches away, This includes one match against every other side and then a second bonus match against their nearest regional rivals.\nThe team that finishes top of the league progresses straight into the final. The teams finishing second and third compete in the Eliminator (or semi-final), with the winner progressing into the final.\nReaction.\nThe decision to create an entirely new format of cricket, with teams based in just seven major cities, has split opinion amongst cricket fans .\nSome current England players have been positive about The Hundred. England's Test captain at the time, Joe Root, welcomed the ECB's plans, believing it would attract a completely new audience to the game. ODI and T20 captain Eoin Morgan expressed a similar opinion. Former T20 captain Stuart Broad said he was hugely optimistic about the new format. Michael Vaughan echoed Broad's comments, believing that it would be an appealing concept to broadcasters, and Michael Atherton stated while a T20 match was rarely completed in a three-hour window, this can be achieved with the Hundred.\nHowever, former MCC chief Keith Bradshaw said he hoped the 100-ball tournament would not be \"innovation for innovation's sake\", and voiced his concern that the new format would mean that the ECB could not exploit the T20 boom. The England and Wales Professional Cricketers' Association announced that, overall, players were \"open-minded\" about the tournament. Indian captain Virat Kohli cited concerns about the commercialisation of cricket and was not entirely in favour of the new version of the game.\nAfter the teams and branding was announced, anti-obesity groups criticised the sponsorship from snack food company KP Snacks.\nSocial media reaction has also been split. During the player draft on the 20 October 2019, the Twitter hashtag \"#OpposeThe100\" began trending, with a vocal section of cricket fans dismayed at the format of the competition, particularly fans of counties whose home grounds are not among the eight used by city franchises. Wisden noted that the response on Twitter and Facebook \"has usually been cutting\" but there has been less negativity on Instagram which is \"mainly used by a younger age group\".\nWomen's cricketers have been particularly enthusiastic about the new format and the decision to run both competitions in parallel, with the same prize money, allowing many to turn professional for the first time.\nAt the conclusion of the inaugural season, it was revealed that 55% of tickets were bought by people who had never bought one before, and that several records were set with regards to television viewing and match attendance figures, particularly for the women's matches. Former England women's captain Charlotte Edwards said that the tournament had \"single-handedly changed women's cricket in this country\".\nAt the conclusion of the second season it was announced that ticket sales had remained relatively stable at 500,000 but that viewing figures from broadcast had dropped by around 2 million compared to the inaugural season, from just over 16 million to 14 million.\nThe format of the tournament may be changed to T20 format as English cricket continues to debate the tournament's future following top-level discussions over the prospect of opening it up to private investment.\nTeams.\nBefore the eight teams were confirmed, it was reported that they would carry a different identity from the long-established county teams and would not be named after cities, counties or venues. In May 2019, the team names were revealed to be:\nSquads.\nEach team is made up of 15 players, a maximum of four of whom can be overseas players. Players are signed using a draft system common in other franchise leagues. At least one England international player is allocated to each franchise in both the women's and men's competitions. The salary cap for each team for the 2022 season was £1,000,000, rising from £800,000 in 2021.\nBroadcasting.\nAll games are televised by Sky Sports, with the BBC also showing 10 men's and 8 women's games free-to-air.\nIn Germany, Sky Sport streamed the initial tournament on their website. They used the signal from Sky Sports UK.\nRecords and statistics.\nTeam records.\nLowest totals.\nThese totals only include completed innings. They also exclude innings where the number of balls to be bowled is reduced, usually because of rain. Successful low scoring run-chases are also excluded."

He did likewise in 1950 and was selected for the British Lions team for their tour to New Zealand and Australia. McKay featured in all six Test matches during the tour, four against New Zealand and two against Australia. He also featured in nine other games during the tour against local opposition, scoring ten tries during the tour, the most of any forward. He again featured in all four of Ireland's matches during the 1951 Five Nations Championship, which saw Ireland win their third championship in four years. His final game for Ireland came against France in January 1952. In total, McKay won 23 caps for Ireland.\nMcKay twice played for Ulster against international opposition, against Australia in 1947 and South Africa in 1951. He also played three games for the Barbarians invitational team, against Cardiff RFC and Swansea RFC in 1948 and against East Midlands in 1951.\nFollowing completion of his studies at Queen's University, Belfast, McKay qualified as a doctor and decided to emigrate to New Zealand."

The tournament was held February 28–March 3 at Ford Center in Evansville, Indiana. Regular-season champion Belmont won the tournament and with it the OVC's automatic berth in the NCAA tournament.\nFormat.\nThe OVC women's tournament is a traditional single-elimination tournament featuring the top eight teams in the conference regular-season standings. This differs from the format used in the OVC men's tournament; while that tournament also involves only eight of the league's 12 members, it has a radically different format, consisting of two stepladder brackets that produce the tournament finalists. The women's tournament is seeded so that the #8 seed faces the #1 seed in the first round, #7 faces #2, and so on. There is no reseeding, so if the #8 team were to defeat the #1 seed it would continue in the tournament playing the team which would have faced the #1 seed in the subsequent round (winner of #4 vs. #5)."

        "text": "The 2018 FIFA Club World Cup final was the final match of the 2018 FIFA Club World Cup, an international club association football tournament hosted by the United Arab Emirates. It was the 15th final of the FIFA Club World Cup, a FIFA-organised tournament between the winners of the six continental confederations, as well as the host nation's league champions.\nThe final was contested between Spanish club and defending champions Real Madrid (who won the last two editions of the competition), representing UEFA as the reigning champions of the UEFA Champions League, and Emirati club Al-Ain, representing the host nation as the reigning champions of the UAE Pro-League. The match was played at the Zayed Sports City Stadium in Abu Dhabi on 22 December 2018.\nReal Madrid won the final 4–1 for their third consecutive and fourth overall FIFA Club World Cup title, breaking the tie with Barcelona to become the outright record winners of the competition.\nTeams.\n\"In the following table, finals until 2005 were in the FIFA Club World Championship era, since 2006 were in the FIFA Club World Cup era.\"\nVenue.\nZayed Sports City Stadium in Abu Dhabi was announced as the venue for the final in May 2018, reprising its role as the final venue in 2009, 2010, and 2017. It is the largest stadium in the United Arab Emirates and is primarily used by the Emirati national football team. Zayed Sports City Stadium hosted the 1996 Asian Cup Final and is planned to host several matches in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup. It is also featured on the 200 Dirham banknote. The 43,000-seat stadium opened in 1980 and also hosted matches in the 2003 FIFA U-20 World Cup and the 2013 FIFA U-17 World Cup.\nBackground.\nReal Madrid qualified for the Club World Cup as winners of the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League by defeating Liverpool in the final. The club won three of the four previous editions of the Club World Cup: in 2014, 2016 and 2017. This was their fifth participation and third consecutive appearance in the tournament, both a record for European teams. The match was their fourth overall final (after 2014, 2016 and 2017), tying the record with Barcelona. The match also was their third consecutive final, extending their record set in the previous edition. The match was the 14th consecutive and overall final featuring a European team (with only the first final in 2000 including no team from Europe), and the 8th overall and 5th consecutive final featuring a Spanish team, all extending the competition records. If Real Madrid were to win, they would become the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles, breaking their tie with Barcelona for the record. A win would also extended the records for most consecutive titles for a team (3), most titles for a confederation (11 for UEFA), most consecutive titles for a confederation (6 for UEFA, breaking the tie set by European teams between 2007 and 2011), most titles for a nation (7 for Spain), and most consecutive titles for a nation (5 for Spain).\nAl-Ain qualified for their first Club World Cup as winners of the 2017–18 season of the UAE Pro-League, the top-level league in the United Arab Emirates. Al-Ain was the first Emirati team to reach the Club World Cup final, as well as the second Asian team (after Kashima Antlers in 2016). The final was also the third final to feature the host representative (after Corinthians in 2000, Raja Casablanca in 2013 and Kashima Antlers in 2016). If Al-Ain were to win, they would have become the first team outside of Europe and South America to win the Club World Cup, as well as the second host representative to win the tournament (after Corinthians in 2000).\nThe final was the second between an Asian and European team, after Real Madrid won against Kashima Antlers in the 2016 final. The final was also the third final between the host representative and a European team, both won by the European team, with Bayern Munich winning against Raja Casablanca in 2013, in addition to the aforementioned 2016 final. The match was the fourth final not to feature a South American team after 2010, 2013 and 2016 (all of which the European teams won).\nRoute to the final.\nReal Madrid.\nAs European champions, Real Madrid received a bye to the semi-final round, where they faced Asian champions Kashima Antlers of Japan. Kashima, who had defeated CONCACAF champions Guadalajara, were defeated by Real Madrid in the 2016 final. Madrid defeated the Antlers 3–1 on a hat-trick scored by Gareth Bale over 11 minutes of play. Bale scored in the 44th minute and added two goals in the 53rd and 55th minutes to open the second half; Shoma Doi scored a consolation goal for Kashima in the 78th minute after it was ruled onside by the video assistant referee.\nAl-Ain.\nIn the first round on 12 December, Al-Ain defeated Team Wellington in a penalty shoot-out following a 3–3 draw at their home stadium, Hazza bin Zayed Stadium. Wellington, a semi-professional club that qualified as the OFC Champions League champion, entered halftime with a 3–1 lead that was cut back by an equalising volley from Marcus Berg. The match remained scoreless after extra time and advanced to a penalty shoot-out, which Al-Ain won 4–3 after five rounds after goalkeeper Khalid Eisa made two saves.\nAl-Ain advanced to face African champions Espérance de Tunis in the second round match, held three days later at Hazza bin Zayed Stadium. The team defeated Espérance 3–0 in an upset that began with two goals scored in the opening 16 minutes. Al-Ain produced a larger upset in the semi-finals, defeating Copa Libertadores champions River Plate in a penalty shoot-out to advance to the Club World Cup final. The match began with two early goals for River Plate scored by Rafael Santos Borré following an opening strike from Berg; after an equalising goal was disallowed by the video assistant referee, Caio Lucas Fernandes scored for Al-Ain in the 51st minute to draw the teams level at 2–2. After a scoreless extra time, aided by goalkeeper Essa's saves, Al-Ain defeated River Plate 5–4 in a penalty shoot-out, its second of the competition, with Essa making one save on River's Enzo Pérez. The semi-final upset of River was called the \"greatest achievement\" in Emirati football history by Al-Ain manager Zoran Mamić.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nReal Madrid had 70 percent of possession in the first half, taking advantage of Al-Ain's defensive lapses to produce 11 shots. After a saved chance from Al-Ain's Hussein El Shahat, Luka Modrić opened scoring for Madrid in the 14th minute with a left-footed shot. Caio attempted to equalize a minute later, but was found to be offside. The half ended with a 1–0 lead for Madrid, with several later shots saved by Al-Ain goalkeeper Khalid Eisa.\nMadrid opened the second half with another series of attacks while retaining possession of the ball, finding its second goal in the 60th minute on a long-distance strike by Marcos Llorente. The pace of the match slowed as Al-Ain looked to find a consolation goal, with Caio taking advantage of a defensive mistake by Sergio Ramos but unable to score against goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. Ramos responded by scoring in the 79th minute, a header on a corner kick taken by Modrić after a counter-attack, to give Real Madrid a three-goal lead. Six minutes later, a free kick taken by Caio found left-back Tsukasa Shiotani, who scored Al-Ain's only goal of the match. In stoppage time, an own goal was scored by Al-Ain's Yahia Nader on a cross by Madrid substitute Vinícius Júnior; it was Madrid's final goal to extend their lead to 4–1.\nDetails.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPost-match.\nWith their win, Real Madrid became the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles. They also extended the record for most consecutive titles with their third in a row. It was the only trophy won by manager Santiago Solari during his reign at Real Madrid, who was hired in October 2018 and fired in March 2019; Solari complimented Al-Ain on their run to the final, calling it a \"remarkable achievement\".\nMarcos Llorente, who scored one goal in the match, won the man of the match award for the final. Gareth Bale of Real Madrid won the Golden Ball award as the best player of the tournament, finishing as joint-top scorer with three goals (tied with Rafael Santos Borré of River Plate). Caio of Al-Ain won the Silver Ball award behind Bale. Real Madrid also won the FIFA Fair Play Award with the best disciplinary record at the tournament."

He remembers using the oven for heat, and boiling water collected from gas stations in the bath tub when either was disconnected. He has a brother who was incarcerated for drug trafficking and murder. After scoring a touchdown, Montgomery frequently holds up a \"V\"-sign in memory of a high school teammate and role model who was murdered during a home invasion.\nWhile he was with Iowa State, Montgomery was chosen as a semi-finalist for the Jason Witten Collegiate Man of the Year Award for his efforts in befriending Hunter Erb, a 6-year-old who was born with multiple congenital heart defects, and orchestrating a team visit to Marshalltown, Iowa to help clean up after a tornado.\nMontgomery and his girlfriend had their first child, a boy, delivered on January 13, 2023."

Each team was permitted a roster of 22 skaters and 3 goaltenders.\nAfter five consecutive Olympic tournaments in which the National Hockey League (the world's premier professional league) allowed its players to participate in the Olympics and adjusted its schedule to accommodate the tournament, the NHL announced in 2017 that it would prohibit any player under NHL contract, including those not actually playing for an NHL team, from participating in the Olympics. The NHL secured the cooperation of the International Ice Hockey Federation and the IOC ensuring that nations would not be allowed to ask NHL players to participate.\nUnlike the NHL, the vast majority of European leagues accommodated an Olympic break, headlined by Russia-based KHL's 33-day break, Sweden-based Swedish Hockey League's 14-day break, Switzerland-based National League's 25-day break, German-based Eishockey Liga's 26-day break, Czech Republic-based Extraliga's 18-day break, and Slovakia-based Tipsport liga's 14-day break.

It is a Grade II* listed building.\nHistory.\nThe church was built in the 14th century although there had been a church on the site from the 12th century. It was rebuilt in 1868 for Lord Bridport.\nThe parish and benefice of Cricket St Thomas is within the Diocese of Bath and Wells.\nArchitecture.\nThe flint building has hamstone dressings and slate roofs. It has a two-bay nave and single-bay chancel with a south transept all supported by buttresses.\nAbove the gable of the wall of the nave is a small tower.\nThe interior is from the 19th century. The church contains monuments to the families of Hood (Viscount Bridport) and their predecessors the Viscounts Nelson, who gained the title through Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson. These include, on the chancel south wall, a commemoration of Alexander Hood, who died in 1814, which was designed and signed by Sir John Soane, with a black marble base topped by a white marble monument on Ionic columns framing the memorial plaque. Mounted on the north nave wall is a fragment of the altar cloth used in the Coronation Service of Queen Elizabeth II.\nIn the churchyard is a white marble monument, dating from the early 20th century, showing a figure of St Michael. It commemorates Alexander Nelson Hood, 4th Duke of Bronté, 2nd First Viscount Bridport (created in 1868) who died in 1904. A note in the church states that for many years the statue was laid flat, as the white figure at night scared too many locals. There are also two 18th-century chest tombs, made from hamstone, one of which commemorates John Northcote, who died in 1738."

In a Mass start event only 30 athletes are allowed to participate and the points awarded for ranks 22 to 30 differ from the system used in other events. Equal placings (ties) give an equal number of points. An athlete's total World Cup Score is the sum of all World Cup points earned in the season, minus the points from 2 events in which the athlete got their worst scores. Ties in this score are broken by comparing the tied athletes' number of victories. If this number is the same for the athletes in question, the number of second places is compared, and so on.

        "text": "Marcus Franklee Foster (born June 3, 1995) is an American professional basketball player for Rytas Vilnius of the Lithuanian Basketball League (LKL).

On February 7, 2018, Foster scored his 2,000th career point on a game-winning shot to defeat DePaul. In his final college game, a loss to Kansas State in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, he scored just five points but embraced Bruce Weber after the game. Foster averaged 19.8 points, 3.9 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game as a senior. Foster was named to the First Team All-Big East. After the season he was invited to the 2018 Portsmouth Invitational Tournament.\nProfessional career.\n2018–19 season.\nAfter going undrafted in the 2018 NBA draft, he joined the Sacramento Kings for the 2018 NBA Summer League. \nOn August 2, 2018, Foster signed his professional contract with Wonju DB Promy of the Korean Basketball League (KBL).

        "title": "Thursday Night Baseball",
        "text": "Thursday Night Baseball is the de facto branding used for live game telecasts of Major League Baseball on Thursday nights.\nHistory.\n\"USA Network Thursday Night Baseball\" (1979–1983).\nFrom 1979 to 1983, the USA Network broadcast Major League Baseball games on Thursday nights.\nThe series began April 26, 1979 with a doubleheader: Cleveland at Kansas City (Jim Woods/Bud Harrelson) followed by Baltimore at California (Monte Moore/Maury Wills). The second game of the night was typically, based out of the West Coast. The games were usually blacked out of the competing teams' cities. Once in a while, when USA did a repeat of the telecast late at night, local cities were allowed to show the rerun.\nFrom 1980 to 1981, Woods and Nelson Briles (replacing Harrelson) did the early games (except for a game at Montreal on October 2, 1980, which reunited Woods with onetime Boston Red Sox radio partner Ned Martin), while Moore and Wes Parker (replacing Wills) called the late game.\nIn 1982, doubleheaders did not start until June 17. Prior to the doubleheaders starting, Moore and Parker did the individual game until then. When the doubleheaders finally began, Moore and Parker moved over to the late game for the rest of the year. Meanwhile, Eddie Doucette (replacing Jim Woods) and Nelson Briles were assigned to call the early game.\nUSA continued with the plan of not starting doubleheaders until June in the final year of the package in 1983. Steve Zabriskie and Al Albert filled in for Eddie Doucette in September 1982 (Steve Grad also occasionally substituted) while Albert replaced Doucette for a game or more in 1983.\n\"ABC's Thursday Night Baseball\" (1989).\nIn 1989, the ABC network aired Thursday night Major League Baseball games after having broadcast \"Monday Night Baseball\" (and occasional Sunday afternoon games) since 1976. This was ABC's final year of consecutive baseball coverage (alongside NBC, which had telecast Saturday afternoon games since 1966 and Major League Baseball in general since 1947) due to CBS signing a four-year contract (spanning from 1990 to 1993) to become the exclusive national broadcast network provider for Major League Baseball games.\nAl Michaels, Jim Palmer, and Tim McCarver formed ABC's lead broadcast team, while Gary Thorne and Joe Morgan were the second team.\nFox Sports Net and Fox Family's coverage (1997–2001).\nIn 1997, as part of the contract with Major League Baseball it had signed the year before, Fox Sports gained an additional outlet for its coverage. Its recently launched network of cable regional sports networks, Fox Sports Net, was given rights to two Thursday night games per week, one for the Eastern and Central time zones and one for the Mountain and Pacific time zones.\nIn 2000, as part of an exclusive contract Fox signed with MLB, that coverage passed to Fox Family Channel and was reduced to one game per week. After the 2000 season, Fox also gained rights to the entire postseason and moved a large portion of its Division Series coverage to Fox Family. This lasted for one season due to The Walt Disney Company acquiring Fox Family. As part of the transaction, Fox Family was renamed ABC Family and ESPN gained the rights to Fox Family and FX's MLB coverage, although the 2002 Division Series aired on ABC Family due to contractual issues, but with ESPN production, a sign of things to come at ABC Sports. Control of the overall contract remained with Fox, meaning they could renegotiate following the 2006 season and not allow ESPN to retain its postseason coverage. For the 2007 season, Fox did exactly that, and TBS became the other home of the postseason as part of its new baseball contract.\nPlay-by-play announcers for the FSN/Fox Family coverage included Kenny Albert, Thom Brennaman, Chip Caray, Josh Lewin, and Steve Physioc. Color analysts included Bob Brenly, Kevin Kennedy, Steve Lyons, and Jeff Torborg. Occasionally, FSN would simulcast a local-team feed of a game from one of its affiliated RSNs in lieu of a dedicated national production.\n\"ESPN Thursday Night Baseball\" (2003–2006).\nESPN Thursday Night Baseball aired on either ESPN or ESPN2 from 2003 to 2006 and featured one game per week, taking over the package that had been on Fox Family Channel. Castrol served as the presenting sponsor for the telecasts.\nThe play-by-play commentator was Chris Berman along with either Joe Morgan or Eric Karros as color commentator. In 2006, Duke Castiglione joined the broadcast as the field reporter.\n\"ESPN Thursday Night Baseball\" ended after the 2006 season because the broadcast rights to the package were lost to TBS. TBS began a package of Sunday afternoon games as a replacement for ESPN's Thursday night games. That package was moved to Tuesday nights in 2022. \nEven though \"Thursday Night Baseball\" as a distinct package ended after the 2006 season, ESPN has still aired select games on Thursday nights, most notably every year since 2017, when Opening Day of the MLB season was moved to Thursdays, as an evening game on Opening Day remains part of ESPN's baseball contract.\n\"Fox Sports Thursday Night Baseball\" (2014–present).\nFox (2019–present).\nFor the 2019 season, Fox Sports announced that they would air games on two Thursday nights in September. These games were branded as part of Fox's \"Baseball Night in America\" package. Four Thursday night games were aired on Fox in a regionalized form, with two each week. The primary games were called by Joe Davis, John Smoltz, and Ken Rosenthal, while the secondary games were called by Kenny Albert, A. J. Pierzynski, and Jon Morosi in 2019.\nWith the 2020 season being abbreviated to just 60 games due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Fox announced that they would broadcast at least four games on Thursday nights beginning on July 30 and continuing through the month of August. Fox aired three weeks of Thursday night games in 2020, with July 30 and August 6 being regionalized, while August 13 was broadcast to the whole country. Fox was supposed to air another week of regional games on August 27, but they were postponed in the wake of player protest after the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and instead those games got rescheduled to Saturday, where they aired as part of the \"Baseball Night in America\" package.\nFor the 2021 season, Fox only aired one Thursday night game. The \"Field of Dreams Game\" between the New York Yankees and the Chicago White Sox.\nFor the 2022 season, Fox aired three weeks of Thursday night games, The first aired was the Field of Dreams game on August 11, then it aired games in 2 weeks of September to avoid conflicts with the network's college football obligations.\nFor the 2023 season, Fox will air games on two Thursday night broadcast windows in August and two weeks of Thursday night games in September, once again to avoid college football conflict.\nFox Sports 1 (2014–present).\nWhile not weekly, Fox Sports 1 (FS1) has aired baseball on Thursday nights occasionally since 2014. One game was aired on Thursdays in 2014 and 2015, two games in 2016, one game in 2017 and two games in 2018, three games were aired in 2020, three games in 2022 and four games in 2023. FS1 usually airs baseball games on Saturday afternoons."

        "title": "Tom Reid (rugby union)",
        "text": "Tom Eymard Reid (3 March 1926 – 12 November 1996) was a rugby union player from Limerick, Ireland who played in the lock position. O'Connor played club rugby with Garryowen and London Irish, was capped thirteen times for Ireland, and was a member of the British and Irish Lions team that toured in 1955.\nPersonal life.\nTom Reid was born on 3 March 1926 in Limerick, Ireland. His father, Joe Reid had also played rugby for Garryowen and his cousin was the Irish international Paddy Reid. Reid attended the Christian Boys' College in Limerick. As well as playing rugby, Reid also rowed for Limerick Boat Club.\nRugby career.\nReid first appearance for the Garryowen club came in the 1947-48 season. With Garryowen, he won the Munster Senior Cup on three occasions, including 1954 when he was the club captain. He played for the Munster representative team in matches against international opposition; against Australia in 1947, South Africa in 1951 and New Zealand in 1954. He later played for London Irish.\nHis first appearance for Ireland was in the 1953 Five Nations Championship, against England. In January 1954 against New Zealand, he moved from his usual position at lock to play at Number 8. He returned to lock for subsequent appearances in the 1954 and 1955 Five Nations Championship matches.\nReid was included in the squad for the British Lions tour to South Africa in 1955. During the tour, Reid played in ten tour games against local opposition and two out of the four test matches against the South Africa national team; the second test where he played at Number 8 position and the third test where he reverted to his usual position at lock.\nIn December 1955, Reid played at Flanker in a combined Scotland &amp; Ireland team that played a combined England &amp; Wales team at Lansdowne Road to mark the opening of the West Upper Stand at the venue. Further appearances for Ireland followed in the 1956 Five Nations and the 1957 Five Nations, the only edition of the championship where Reid played in all four of Ireland's games. His 13th and final game for Ireland came in that championship, against Wales.\nReid also played 14 games for the Barbarians invitational team, including six games on the team's first overseas tour to Canada in 1957. Reid decided to emigrate to Canada following the tour. In 1959 Reid played for the Eastern Canada team in their match against the British Lions. As of 2017 (note as well as Ricki Flutey (NZ Maori 2005 v Lions, and played for the lions in 2009), James Hook also played for and against the Lions (Lions 2009, baabaas 2013), and Jarred Payne and Elliot Daly both played for the baabaas against the lions in 2013 and subsequently played for the lions on tour in 2017. Multiple Lions also played for the BaaBaas in 1977, and tbc whether any of the Welsh XV who played the Lions in 1955 had previously played for, or subsequently went on to play for, the Lions), he is one of only two players to have played both for and against the Lions."

The programme was created in 2017 to involve the official Formula 1 video game and its community of players, providing a new avenue for greater engagement with the sport of Formula 1. In 2018, the official Formula 1 teams joined the programme for the first time to set up their own esports teams to compete in the Formula 1 Esports Series championship.\nHistory.\nThe first Formula One Esports Series was announced on 21 August 2017, with the qualification and finals stages to be held on the official Formula 1 video game of the 2017 championship. Over 60,000 gamers participated in the inaugural series, watched by 123 countries around the world and generating over 20 million impressions on social media. Brendon Leigh of the UK was the first champion of the series.\n2018 was Formula 1's first full season in esports and was split into 2 stages. In the first stage that opened in April 2018, online racers were offered the incredible opportunity to earn a place on the official esports driver line-up for one of the official F1 teams. Mercedes AMG Petronas Motorsport, Red Bull Racing, Force India F1 Team, Williams, Renault Sport F1 Team, Haas F1 Team, McLaren, Toro Rosso and Alfa Romeo Sauber F1 Team all offered positions in their esports driver line ups as part of the series inaugural Pro Draft. Over 66,000 gamers participated to vie for a spot in the official F1 teams' esports team who competed in the F1 New Balance Esports Series and a chance to win a share of the $200,000 prize fund. The series drew a record audience of 5.5million across selected TV networks and live streams online. Mercedes took the 2018 Team Championship and Brendon Leigh became two-time Driver Champion.\nOn 8 April 2019, Formula 1 announced the third instalment of the F1 Esports Series, with an increased prize fund of $500,000. Ferrari joined the series after choosing not to take part the year prior. The series was won by David Tonizza, driving for Ferrari Driver Academy, with Red Bull Racing Esports taking the Constructors' Trophy.\nDue to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the 2020 and 2021 seasons were held remotely online rather than in a LAN setting. Both titles were won by Jarno Opmeer, in 2020 for Alfa Romeo Racing Orlen Esports and in 2021 for Mercedes-AMG Petronas Esports. Frederik Rasmussen finished as runner-up in both championships. The championship remained online for the 2022 season, when Lucas Blakeley and McLaren Shadow claimed their first titles in the series.\nFor the next season, the championship would be renamed to \"F1 Sim Racing\" and was contested across late 2023 and early 2024."

        "text": "AO Tennis is a tennis video game developed and published by Big Ant Studios. \"AO Tennis\" was released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Android and iOS on January 5, 2018. It is the first official licensed game of the Australian Open.\nIt features a career mode where the player works to become world No. #1, starting by being world No. #1500.\nGameplay.\nThe game includes licences for players including Rafael Nadal and Angelique Kerber. \"AO Tennis\" allows players to create their own athletes, sponsorship logos, clothing and stadiums to play in.\nDevelopment.\nThe game's release featured a \"day one patch\" that added many features.\nThe game's release for iOS, and Android came before the console release, which was released in time for the start for the real-world Australian Open.\nIn April 2018, Big Ant Studios announced AO International Tennis for a global release on May 8, 2018. AO International Tennis would be a significantly reworked and enhanced title, with significantly improved gameplay and \"more than twice\" the number of gameplay modes that AO Tennis had at launch. In an interview with WCCFTech, Big Ant Studios CEO, Ross Symons, said:\n\"It’s not so much “tweaks and changes” as AO International Tennis is genuinely a new game. It’s got double the gameplay modes, far greater levels of customization, and a vastly improved gameplay engine to what AO Tennis launched with. When people watch videos of AO Tennis and AO International Tennis, they’ll see two very different experiences.\"\nReception.\nWith most reviews written prior to the release of the \"day one patch\" there was a great variance in the scores given, as is shown with media aggregator website Metacritic scoring the PlayStation 4 version at 49% based on 4 reviews, while user reviews were at 88% for PlayStation 4 and 95% for Xbox. Reception for the game ranged from 3/10 to as high as 8/10 largely based on whether reviewers had downloaded the \"day one patch\" or not. Stevivor, having downloaded the appropriate \"day one patch\", was positive on the game, writing \"This is definitely a game I’d recommend to tennis fans\" in its 7/10 review. Fox Sports reviewed the game without downloading the \"day one patch\", scoring it 4/10 calling the movement \"clunky\", and commenting that the game's AI often \"decided not to swing at the ball\", \"rather than us mis-hitting it\". Kotaku were highly negative about the game's release, commenting on the lack of gameplay footage released before launch. but also admitted to not downloading the \"day one patch\", later apologising for this oversight. Kotaku called the release build of the game \"rough\", particularly commenting on the game's doubles action, where players were \"lifeless, stiff, and unresponsive to the action around them\". GameSpot scored \"AO Tennis\" 3/10, noting \"bland visuals\", \"inconsistent\" physics. GameSpot were critical of the game's graphics, referring that \"each real-life pro looks wooden.\"\nPress Start Australia, after playing AO Tennis a few weeks after launch, wrote \"After 10+ updates and the last one being quite major, it’s honestly quite insane to see just how far this game has come over the last few weeks.\"\nAO International Tennis received a far more positive response from critics. The Xbox Hub wrote that AO International Tennis is \"right up there with the very best tennis titles available today,\" and gave it 8/10. The Spanish-speaking SomosXbox wrote \"AO International Tennis is an interesting video game for tennis fans, the game has a nice gameplay,\" and scored the game 6.5/10. Forbes, in scoring the game 6.7/10, praised the customisation options, writing \"All non-license sports games should emulate AO International Tennis' approach to create-a-player and create-a-stadium suites.\"\nSequel.\n\"AO Tennis 2\" was released on January 9, 2020 in Europe and February 11, 2020 in North America for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows and Nintendo Switch. It was released in Japan on May 14, 2020."

The 2018 tournament was held at Aldersley Leisure Village. Beginning with this tournament, the winner of the title would receive \"The Eric Bristow Trophy\", named after the legendary player who died in April 2018.\nThe tournament's defending champion was Michael van Gerwen, who won the tournament in 2017 by defeating Peter Wright 16–12 in the final to win it for a third straight year, but lost in the semi-finals to Gary Anderson by the same scoreline 16–12.\nGerwyn Price won his first PDC major title by defeating Gary Anderson 16–13, in a highly controversial final. Price also became the first Welsh player to win a PDC major title.\nThe DRA launched an investigation into the behaviour from both players in the final. Price was fined £21,500 for a combination of 'Bringing the sport into disrepute and gamesmanship' in the final and for his Quarter-final clash with Simon Whitlock. Price was also given a three month ban, which was suspended for 6 months. Anderson was given a formal warning for pushing Price on the oche. Price's fine was subsequently reduced on appeal to a total of £11,500.\nDimitri Van den Bergh hit the fourth nine dart leg in Grand Slam of Darts history, in his second round match against Stephen Bunting, and for the first time in the tournament history no Englishman progressed into the quarter-final stage.\nPrize money.\nThe prize fund for the Grand Slam was the same as in 2017, with the winner getting £110,000.\nQualifying.\nPDC Qualifying Tournaments.\nAt most sixteen players could qualify through this method, where the position in the list depicts the priority of the qualification.\nAs the list of qualifiers from the main tournaments produced fewer than sixteen players, the field of sixteen players is filled from the reserve lists. The first list consists of the winners from 2018 European Tour events, in which the winners are ordered by number of event wins then in Order of Merit position order at the cut-off date.\nIf there are still less than sixteen qualified players after the winners of European Tour events are added, the winners of 2018 Players Championships events will be added, firstly by winners of multiple events followed by Order of Merit order.\nPDC Qualifying Event.\nA further eight places in the Grand Slam of Darts were filled by qualifiers from a PDC qualifier that took place in Wigan on 5 November.\nThese are the qualifiers:\nBDO Ranking qualifiers.\nThe remaining 5 BDO places were determined via the BDO Invitational Rankings at the end of September 2018.\nDraw.\nGroup stage.\n\"All group matches are best of nine legs\" \"After three games, the top two in each group qualify for the knock-out stage\"\nNB: P = Played; W = Won; L = Lost; LF = Legs for; LA = Legs against; +/− = Plus/minus record, in relation to legs; Pts = Points; Status = Qualified to knockout stage\nGroup A.\n10 November\n11 November\n13 November\nGroup B.\n10 November\n11 November\n13 November\nGroup C.\n10 November\n11 November\n13 November\nGroup D.\n10 November\n11 November\n13 November\nGroup E.\n10 November\n11 November\n12 November\nGroup F.\n10 November\n11 November\n12 November\nGroup G.\n10 November\n11 November\n12 November\nGroup H.\n10 November\n11 November\n12 November"

Van Gerwen was unbeaten for 77 live matches (including the two live World Series events) on the channel during that period.\nThe tournament was severely affected by the extreme weather conditions caused by Storm Emma which had forced the complete cancellation of round five of the 2018 Premier League Darts that had been due to be held in Exeter the evening before the tournament started. Eleven players who were due to play in the first, second and third rounds withdrew from the competition, and on 2 March, the unprecedented decision was taken by Butlin's to not allow any fans apart from the players relatives, guests and friends into the venue, resulting in the whole tournament being played behind closed doors.\nThe tournament was still televised live on ITV4, but the Butlin's Skyline Pavilion Arena was unable to be used for the allocated Main Stage TV matches due to heavy snow and ice, so these matches were reallocated to the secondary Red's Bar stage.\nFormat and qualifiers.\nUK Open qualifiers.\nThere were six qualifying events staged in February 2018 to determine the UK Open Order of Merit Table.

For the first time, the winner of the tournament, (Gary Anderson) received the Phil Taylor Trophy, which was renamed in his honour in January 2018.\nGary Anderson hit a nine dart finish in the fourth leg of his quarter-final match against Joe Cullen, which was the seventh nine-dart finish in the World Matchplay and the first since 2014. Anderson overcame Cullen 19–17, facing two match darts against him at 14–15 scoreline.\nAnderson went on to win his first World Matchplay title, defeating Mensur Suljović, 21–19 after extra time in the longest final in the tournament's history.\nThe first round match between Kim Huybrechts and John Henderson made a piece of World Matchplay history, as it was the first time that a match was won by a single leg since the 1997 3rd place play-off. Huybrechts won the match 13–12 in a sudden-death leg, the first time the rule had been needed since it was introduced in 2013. \nFor the first time in World Matchplay history, no Englishmen progressed into the semi-finals, resulting in a first Matchplay final without an English player.\nPrize money.\nThe prize fund remained at £500,000, with the winner's earnings being £115,000. Gary Anderson received £45,000 for hitting a nine-dart finish in his quarter-final against Joe Cullen.\nFormat.\nIn previous stagings of the event all games had to be won by two clear legs with no sudden-death legs. However, after consulting the host broadcaster Sky Sports in 2013, the PDC decided that games will now only proceed for a maximum of six extra legs before a tie-break leg is required. For example, in a best of 19 legs first round match, if the score reaches 12–12 then the 25th leg will be the decider.\nQualification.\nThe top 16 players on the PDC Order of Merit as of 2 July 2018 were seeded for the tournament.

        "text": "The 2019 William Hill World Darts Championship was the 26th World Championship organised by the Professional Darts Corporation since it separated from the British Darts Organisation. The event took place at Alexandra Palace in London from 13 December 2018 to 1 January 2019.\nIn the biggest overhaul since 2006, when 16 extra participants were added, the number of participants increased from 72 to 96. The top 32 from the PDC Order of Merit competed with the 32 highest ranked players on the PDC Pro Tour Order of Merit and 32 qualifiers from around the world, including two female darts players. The tournament length was consequently increased from six to seven rounds, while the preliminary round was dropped. The tournament was played in 28 afternoon and evening sessions (an increase of six sessions over 2018) over the 20-day period with four rest days included for both Christmas and also New Year's Eve, with 95 matches played.\nRob Cross was the defending champion, but lost 4–2 to Luke Humphries in the fourth round. \nMichael van Gerwen won his third world title with a 7–3 victory over Michael Smith.\nIt was the first PDC World Championship without retired Phil Taylor, and the first time Taylor had not played in either World Championship since 1989. 2004 runner-up Kevin Painter was also a notable absentee, failing to qualify for the first time since 1997, when he was a BDO player.\nPrize money.\nThe prize money for the tournament was £2,500,000 in total, £700,000 more than 2018. The winner's prize money was £500,000, adding £100,000 to the previous year's winners share.\nIt was the first ever World Darts Championship to match Snooker in prize money received for the eventual World Champion during the same calendar year. At the time of the last unified World Darts Championship in 1993 the Snooker World Champion received almost 6 times more prize money than the Darts equivalent. It would also be the first World Darts Championship to have a greater overall prize fund to that of the World Snooker Championship.

Rob Cross was second seed and reigning champion, having won the 2018 championship on his debut. As well as van Gerwen and Cross, three other previous PDC world champions qualified as seeds, two-time champions Gary Anderson and Adrian Lewis, and 2007 champion Raymond van Barneveld. Three other seeds, 18th seeded Stephen Bunting, 20th seeded Steve Beaton and 24th seeded Jelle Klaasen, were previous champions of the BDO World Darts Championship, as was van Barneveld.\nThe top seeds below van Gerwen and Cross were 2018 World Grand Prix runner-up Peter Wright, Gary Anderson, 2018 Players Championship Finals winner Daryl Gurney and 2018 Grand Slam of Darts winner Gerwyn Price.\nDanny Noppert, in his debut year with the PDC, was the highest ranked non-seed on the 2018 PDC Pro Tour Order of Merit. As well as Noppert, 5 other qualifiers through the Pro Tour made their debut; Gabriel Clemens, Ryan Joyce, Nathan Aspinall, Ryan Searle and Matthew Edgar. Edgar took the final qualification place after 2018 UK Open runner-up Corey Cadby withdrew. The list of qualifiers also included the 2018 Youth Champion Dimitri Van den Bergh and 2018 World Matchplay semi-finalist Jeffrey de Zwaan.\nAs part of the expansion of the world championship, there was an increase in the number of tournaments and ranking systems offering qualification places. Places were now offered to the winner of the Challenge Tour, the top two from the Development Tour (where previously only the winner had qualified), the top four of the new Asian Tour, and the top American and Canadian players on the North American Championship Darts Circuit. Previous qualification places to the top two players on the Nordic &amp; Baltic rankings and the winner of the Dartplayers Australia rankings also remained.\nThe international qualifiers included new Indian and African qualifiers, and the Southern Europe qualifier being split into South/West and South/East. Tahuna Irwin, who won the New Zealand qualifier, had to withdraw after being denied entry to the UK, and subsequently being banned from entry, when attempting to compete in the 2018 PDC World Youth Championship. His place was given to the New Zealand runner-up, Craig Ross.\nThe tournament also saw two tournaments to qualify female players for the tournament. This followed the wildcard invitations of Gayl King to the 2001 tournament and Anastasia Dobromyslova to the 2009 tournament, and also came in the wake of the qualification of China's Momo Zhou for the 2018 PDC World Cup of Darts. Dobromyslova, three times BDO women's world champion, returned to the PDC championship after winning the rest of the world tournament, while the UK tournament was won by four time women's world champion, and reigning 2018 champion, Lisa Ashton.\nThe final placings were determined by the PDPA qualifier held at Arena MK on 26 November, with two places as standard and an extra place as Youth Champion Van den Bergh had already qualified. Stephen Burton, Adam Hunt and Aden Kirk took the three places, all three of them making their debuts.\nIn addition to the three PDPA qualifiers, 15 more of the international qualifiers were making their PDC World Championship debuts, Lisa Ashton, James Bailey, Kevin Burness, Nitin Kumar, Darius Labanauskas, Daniel Larsson, Yuanjun Liu, Jim Long, Noel Malicdem, Yordi Meeuwisse, Geert Nentjes, Chuck Puleo, Craig Ross, Karel Sedláček and Raymond Smith. Labanauskas was the first ever Lithuanian to qualify for the PDC World Championship.\nSummary.\nThe top quarter of the draw saw number one seed Michael van Gerwen easily reach the quarter-final, knocking Alan Tabern out in the second round despite having beer thrown at him during the walk on, before consecutive 4–1 victories over Max Hopp and former world champion Adrian Lewis. Other former champion Raymond van Barneveld was eliminated in the second round following a 3–2 loss to Darius Labanauskas. James Wade controversially beat Seigo Asada in the second round, having been perceived to have shouted in his opponent's face after winning the second set, and saying after the match that he \"wanted to hurt\" Asada; Wade subsequently apologised, citing a hypomania episode. Wade was eliminated in the fourth round by debutant Ryan Joyce. In the quarter-final, van Gerwen triumphed over Joyce, 5–1, to qualify for the semi-final for the sixth time in seven championships.\nIn the second quarter, fourth seed Gary Anderson had to come through last-set deciders against Jermaine Wattimena and Chris Dobey to reach the quarter-final, while fifth-seed Daryl Gurney was eliminated in the third round by 2018 semi-finalist Jamie Lewis. Dave Chisnall came back from 0–2 down against Josh Payne to run off eleven consecutive sets over three matches, beating Payne 3–2 before 4–0 wins over Kim Huybrechts and Lewis. In the quarter-final, Anderson won 5–2 against Chisnall to set up a semi-final with van Gerwen.\nIn the third quarter, reigning champion Rob Cross defeated Jeffrey de Zwaan in the second round, before beating Cristo Reyes 4–0 in the third round. Two-time consecutive world youth champion Dimitri Van den Bergh was beaten by two-time consecutive Development Tour winner Luke Humphries in the third round. In round four, Humphries played Cross. The defending champion went 2–0 up, before Humphries fought back to win 4–2 and end Cross's reign. Seventh-seed Mensur Suljović was eliminated by Ryan Searle, and tenth-seed Michael Smith eliminated Ron Meulenkamp before beating John Henderson and Searle to reach the quarter-final. Smith secured a semi-final slot with a 5–1 win over Humphries.\nIn the fourth quarter, the four top seeds were eliminated in the second round, with third-seed Peter Wright losing to Toni Alcinas, sixth-seed Gerwyn Price being eliminated by Nathan Aspinall, eleventh-seeded Ian White losing to South African Devon Petersen and Brendan Dolan whitewashing fourteenth seed Joe Cullen. Further seeds were eliminated in the third round, with thirtieth seed Benito van de Pas being the only seed from this quarter in the fourth round, and unseeded players Aspinall, Petersen and Dolan taking the other three slots. Aspinall defeated Petersen, with Dolan getting a 4–1 win over van de Pas to reach the quarter-final. In the quarter-final, Aspinall easily beat Dolan 5–1 to reach the semi-final on his debut year.\nIn the first semi-final, Aspinall played Smith. Smith won the first two sets without dropping a leg, before Aspinall came back to make it 2–2. Each player won one of the next two sets to make it 3–3, before Smith won two consecutive sets 3–1 and the final set 3–0 to win the match and qualify for the first World Championship final of his career. Smith scored 17 180s, the most by a player in a World Championship semi-final.\nIn the second semi-final, Anderson played van Gerwen in a repeat of the 2017 final. After van Gerwen won the first set in a last-leg decider, he then won twelve of the next thirteen legs to quickly take a 5–0 lead in the first-to-six match. Anderson managed to avoid the whitewash by winning the sixth set, but van Gerwen completed the rout in the next set, qualifying for the final for the fourth time in his career.\nIn the final, held on New Year's Day 2019, van Gerwen won the first two legs before missing one set-dart in each of the next two legs for Smith to force a last-leg set decider, which van Gerwen won. Van Gerwen broke Smith's throw with a 3–1 win in the second set, and lengthened his lead by taking the third set by the same scoreline. Smith lost the fourth set after missing four darts at double 12 in the decider, but won the fifth set 3–2 to avoid the whitewash and took the sixth set 3–0. Van Gerwen restored his three-set advantage with a 3–1 win in the seventh set. Smith missed three darts for the eighth set, which van Gerwen won to go one set away from victory. The ninth set went to a deciding leg, which Smith won to prolong the match. Van Gerwen took the first two legs in the tenth set, and missed one dart for the championship in the third leg; in the next, he hit double 16 to take the set and win the World Championship for the third time.\nTop averages.\nThis table shows the highest averages achieved by players throughout the tournament.\nRepresentation.\nThis table shows the number of players by country in the 2019 PDC World Championship. A total of 28 nationalities were represented, the most ever at a darts world championship. The second round sees an increase in participation for some countries due to the first round bye for the 32 highest ranked players."

It was his fourth Wimbledon title and 13th major title overall, passing Roy Emerson to outright fourth place on the all time men's singles major wins list. The win was also Djokovic's first title in over 12 months, his previous win having been at Eastbourne on July 1, 2017, and returned him to the top 10 in the rankings. The competition was contested by all but one of the top 20 male players at the time. Incidentally, this was the first and only time that an incumbent President and Vice President of the ATP Player Council faced each other in a final.\nRoger Federer was the defending champion and top seed, but lost in the quarterfinals to Anderson despite leading by two sets and having a match point in the third set. Rafael Nadal and Federer were in contention for the world No. 1 singles ranking; Nadal retained the top ranking by reaching the fourth round.\nStan Wawrinka was attempting to complete the career grand slam, but he lost to Thomas Fabbiano in the second round.\nProgress of the competition.\nRoger Federer was the defending champion and top seed. Federer and Rafael Nadal were in contention for the ATP No. 1 ranking at the start of the tournament. Former champion and local favourite Andy Murray announced on the day before the tournament began that he was pulling out because he was not fully recovered from hip surgery. His place was taken by \"lucky loser\" Jason Jung.\n2017 finalist and no. 3 seed Marin Čilić went out in the second round of the tournament, defeated by Guido Pella of Argentina. Čilić had been two sets up when rain stopped play, but had difficulty coping with the conditions after play was resumed, and complained to the umpire about the state of the grass. The following morning, when they returned to continue the match, Pella won in five sets.\nFeliciano López made his 66th consecutive Grand Slam main draw appearance, surpassing the previous record of 65 consecutive appearances he jointly held with Federer. López was defeated in the second round by no 5 seed Juan Martín del Potro.\nNadal retained his top ranking by reaching the semifinal. Federer lost in the quarterfinals to Kevin Anderson despite leading by two sets to love and having a match point in the third set. The semifinal match between Anderson and John Isner, lasting 6 hours 36 minutes, was the second longest men's singles match at Wimbledon and the third longest men's singles match in tennis history. Isner has thus played in the two longest matches in Wimbledon history (the other one being the record-holding 2010 match against Nicolas Mahut). The 2018 semifinals were the longest two semifinals in Wimbledon history.\nAnderson became the first man representing South Africa to reach the Wimbledon men's singles final since Brian Norton in 1921 (South African-born Kevin Curren represented the United States when he was a finalist in 1985). Anderson held a total of five set points in the third set of the championship match, but was unable to force a fourth set.\nSeeds.\nAll seedings per modified ATP rankings."

        "text": "The 2018 US Open was the 138th edition of tennis' US Open and the fourth and final Grand Slam event of the year. It was held on outdoor hard courts at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York City.\nRafael Nadal and Sloane Stephens were the defending champions in the men's and women's singles events, however both failed to defend their titles. Nadal retired during his semifinal match against Juan Martín del Potro. Stephens was defeated in the quarterfinals by Anastasija Sevastova, whom Stephens had beaten at the same stage the previous year.\nNovak Djokovic won the men's singles title, defeating del Potro in the final, 6–3, 7–6(7–4), 6–3. It was his third US Open title and 14th Grand Slam, tying Pete Sampras' record to become equal third among all-time Grand Slam champions. In women's singles, Naomi Osaka defeated Serena Williams in the final, 6–2, 6–4, becoming Japan's first-ever able-bodied Grand Slam singles champion.\nTournament.\nThe 2018 US Open was the 138th edition of the tournament and took place at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park of Queens in New York City, New York, United States. The tournament was held on 17 DecoTurf hard courts.\nThe tournament was an event run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and was part of the 2018 ATP World Tour and the 2018 WTA Tour calendars under the Grand Slam category. The tournament consisted of both men's and women's singles and doubles draws as well as a mixed doubles event. There are also singles and doubles events for both boys and girls (players under 18), which are part of the Grade A category of tournaments. Additionally, there are singles and doubles wheelchair tennis events for men, women and quads.\nThe tournament was played on hard courts and takes place on a series of 17 courts with DecoTurf surface, including the three existing main showcourts – Arthur Ashe Stadium, the newly renovated Louis Armstrong Stadium, and the new Grandstand.\nBroadcast.\nIn the United States, the 2018 US Open will be the fourth year in a row under an 11-year, $825 million contract with ESPN, in which the broadcaster holds exclusive rights to the entire tournament and the US Open Series. This means that the tournament is not available on broadcast television. This also makes ESPN the exclusive U.S. broadcaster for three of the four tennis majors.\nPoint and prize money distribution.\nPoint distribution.\nBelow is a series of tables for each of the competitions showing the ranking points on offer for each event.\nPrize money.\nThe total prize-money compensation for the 2018 US Open is $53 million, a more than 5% increase on the same total last year. Of that total, a record $3.8 million goes to both the men's and women's singles champions, which is increased by 2.7% from last year. This makes the US Open the most lucrative and highest paying tennis grand slam in the world, leapfrogging the French Open in total prize money fund. Prize money for the US Open qualifying tournament is also up 10.3%, to $3.2 million. The prize money for the wheelchair draw amounts to a total of US$350,000. The singles winners of the men and women draws receive US$31,200 and the winner of the quad singles receives US$23,400.\nNotable stories.\nWomen's singles final.\nNaomi Osaka defeated Serena Williams in the final, 6–2, 6–4. During the final, Williams received three code violations, the second coming with a point penalty and the third with a game penalty. The issue started during the second set when chair umpire Carlos Ramos cited Serena for a signal that was sent from her coach. Serena said she was unaware of the signal and verbally sparred with Ramos, saying \"I don't cheat to win. I'd rather lose.\" After a mistake later in the second set, Serena smashed her racket into the court. This led to her second code violation, which Serena found out about upon attempting to serve and which increased the dispute between Serena and Ramos. At this point, referring to the first violation for coaching, Serena stated \"You owe me an apology. I have never cheated in my life.\" During the change at the 3–4 mark, a further discussion between Serena and Ramos broke down leading Serena to call Ramos both \"a liar\" and \"a thief\" for issuing the point penalty. As both players were concluding the changeover and getting set, Ramos issued Serena her third code violation, this time for verbal abuse. \nThis led to confusion from both players who did not appear to hear the announcement, which Ramos explained to both after summoning them over to his seat. At this point, US Open referee, Brian Earley, and WTA supervisor, Donna Kelso, were summoned to the court due to the dispute. A four-minute delay occurred due to a discussion between Serena, Earley, and Kelso regarding the issues. After the delay, Serena won the next game before Osaka won the set and match.\nSingles seeds.\nThe following are the seeded players and notable players who have withdrawn from the event. Seedings are based on ATP and WTA rankings as of August 20, 2018. Rank and points before are as of August 27, 2018.\nMen's singles.\n†The player did not qualify for the tournament in 2017, but is defending points from one or more 2017 ATP Challenger Tour tournaments.\nWomen's singles.\n† Serena Williams was ranked 26 on the day when seeds were announced. Nevertheless, she was deemed a special case and seeded 17th by the organizers because she missed a significant portion of the last 12-month period due to pregnancy and maternity.&lt;br&gt;\n‡ The player did not qualify for the tournament in 2017. Accordingly, points for her 16th best result are deducted instead.\nDoubles seeds.\nMen's doubles.\n1Rankings as of August 20, 2018.\nWomen's doubles.\n1Rankings as of August 20, 2018.\nMixed doubles.\n1Rankings as of August 20, 2018.\nWild card entries.\nThe following players were given wildcards to the main draw based on internal selection and recent performances.\nQualifier entries.\nThe qualifying competitions took place at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on August 21–24, 2018.\nProtected ranking.\nThe following players were accepted directly into the main draw using a protected ranking:\nWithdrawals.\nThe following players were accepted directly into the main tournament, but withdrew with injuries, suspensions or for personal reasons.\nExternal links.\n "

        "title": "Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League",
        "text": "The Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League (MPBL) is a men's professional basketball league in the Philippines consisting of 29 teams. \nFounded in 2017 by eight-division boxing world champion Manny Pacquiao, the MPBL is not intended to be a competitor to the top-flight Philippine Basketball Association, but rather to provide a gateway for local, homegrown talents to showcase their skills. The league uses a home-and-away format, similar to the defunct Metropolitan Basketball Association. The MPBL started a semi-professional league before being granted professional status in 2021 by the Games and Amusements Board. \nFurther developments include the youth-oriented Junior MPBL, which launched in July 2023, and a volleyball counterpart called the Maharlika Pilipinas Volleyball Association (MPVA), which launched in October 2023. \nThe Pampanga Giant Lanterns are the current defending champions, beating the Bacoor City Strikers in three games during the 2023 MPBL Finals.\nHistory.\nFounding.\nPacquiao formally launched the MPBL on August 29, 2017, with the intent to feature both the commercial and barangay-level side, with teams on the commercial side to have a home locality in addition to a corporate sponsor. The plan was for the league to begin with Luzon-based teams only and then expand to Visayas and Mindanao later on. The expanded league would have two divisions, North and South, where one team from both divisions face in a finals series similar to the format of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in North America. The league was planned to start as early as September 23, 2017 with at least six teams. A preseason tournament was held with the Bulacan Kuyas finishing as champions. Snow Badua was the league's inaugural commissioner, but he did not take on the role when the first season eventually began as six-time PBA champion Kenneth Duremdes succeeeded Badua as league commissioner on November 22, 2017.\nSemi-professional era.\nThe MPBL began its inaugural season on January 25, 2018 at the Smart Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City. The inaugural season featured ten teams, all based in Luzon, with the requirement of each team having three homegrown players. In the opening game, the Parañaque Patriots scored a 70–60 victory over the Caloocan Supremos. The playoffs only had eight teams due to the small size, concluding with the Batangas City Athletics winning the inaugural title in the 2018 Finals against the Muntinlupa Cagers\nIn the 2018–19 season, the league added sixteen expansion teams, bringing the total to 26 teams. Five of the sixteen expansions are based in Visayas and Mindanao, thus marking the league's national expansion. The North and South Divisions were introduced and the playoff pool doubled to sixteen teams, eight per division. The league also placed roster restrictions on teams, only allowing one Filipino-foreigner and up to five ex-professional players, the former of which caused criticism from players and fans. This season also saw the inaugural edition of the MPBL All-Star Game, which was held at the SM Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay. The San Juan Knights would win the title that season against the Davao Occidental Tigers in the 2019 National Finals, which is to date, the only series to go the full length of five games.\nThe following 2019–20 season featured 31 teams participating in the league, the most the league had in its history, adding six expansion teams but also saw its first departing team, the Mandaluyong El Tigre. Roster restrictions were also relaxed, allowing more Filipino-foreigners and ex-professional players to play in the league. In December 2019, Chooks-to-Go of Bounty Agro Ventures became the title sponsor of the league under what was initially a five-year deal.\nCOVID-19 disruption.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, the league suspended play on March 12, 2020. Nearly a year later, on March 6, 2021, the league announced the resumption of its playoffs. The remainder of the league's 2020 playoffs was held at a bubble at the Subic Bay Gymnasium. In a rematch of the 2019 National Finals series, the Davao Occidental Tigers won the 2021 National Finals against the San Juan Knights.\nBecause of the restrictions imposed by the government due to the pandemic, the league's 2020–21 season would be cancelled. The league's fourth season would be postponed multiple times before it eventually began in 2022. In October 2021, Chooks-to-Go took over the league's basketball operations.\nProfessional era.\nOn November 9, 2021, it was announced that the MPBL would turn into a professional league. A month later, on December 9, 2021, the MPBL was granted professional status by the Games and Amusements Board (GAB). This also allowed the league to feature collegiate players on team rosters, as long as the player itself is a Special Guest Licensee. The league's first professional event was the 2021 Invitational. During which, all roster restrictions were lifted.\nThe 2022 season would finally begin over a year after last season's conclusion, which featured 22 of the 31 teams from the previous season. The season marked a new sponsorship with sports betting platform OKBet, succeeding Chooks-to-Go as the title sponsor. The Nueva Ecija Rice Vanguards became the first team to achieve a regular season sweep and subsequently won the 2022 National Finals against the Zamboanga Family's Brand Sardines. The succeeding 2023 season featured 29 teams, including two expansion teams and five returning teams. The season culminated with the homegrown-laden Pampanga Giant Lanterns sweeping the Bacoor City Strikers in the 2023 National Finals.\nDuring this time, a trend began of teams participating in other leagues during the MPBL offseason. This first occurred in FilBasket during the Subic 2021 and Summer 2022 championships, which saw multiple teams participate due to the long gap between the 2019–20 and 2022 seasons. In recent years, teams that were eliminated for the season would compete in the Pilipinas Super League (PSL) during the offseason.\nThe upcoming 2024 season features29 teams, which includes the arrival of two expansion teams but also the departure of three teams. The ex-professional player limit will also be removed, allowing teams to sign any number of professional players onto their rosters.\nFurther developments.\nFollowing the success of the MPBL, Pacquiao has made further developments in grassroots-based sports. On June 15, 2023, the Junior MPBL was unveiled in a press conference. The youth-oriented league's inaugural season began on July 9, 2023 with teams competing in 14-under, 16-under, and 18-under divisions. The junior league will soon feature a 21-under division, billed as the \"Junior MPBL D-League\", which will commence in May 2024. In the same press conference announcing the junior league, Pacquiao also shared intent to create a volleyball counterpart similar to the MPBL that will cater to female players. That league would be known as the Maharlika Pilipinas Volleyball Association (MPVA) and began on October 22, 2023 with eight teams.\nOn November 7, 2023, the league launched its social arm, the \"MPBL Kalinga\", with the goal of providing medical assistance to MPBL players, former and current, as well as league officials and staff.\nTeams.\nThe MPBL began with ten Luzon-based teams in 2018, which was then increased to 26 teams following the national expansion in 2018–19. As of 2024, the league currently has 29 active member teams.\nThe league divides the teams into two divisions based on geographic location: the North Division and the South Division. Metro Manila has the most teams out of any region with nine followed by Calabarzon with five and Central Luzon with four. In terms of island groups, most of the teams are located in Luzon, which has 22 teams. Meanwhile, Mindanao has four teams while Visayas has three.\nRoster regulations.\nThere is no draft held during the off-season, instead, teams acquire their players through the signing of contracts. Teams must have a minimum of 15 players in their roster, with the maximum being 22. In each game, however, teams can only field a 15-man roster into the court. All local players are eligible, although teams can also sign up to two Filipino-foreigners. The league currently doesn't allow imports to join the league.\nBeing based in the grassroots level, each team is required to have at least three homegrown players who come from the team's home locality. Since 2022, with the transition to professional status, the league has also allowed collegiate players to join as long as the player is granted a Special Guest License from the Games and Amusement Board. (Starting June 1, 2024, the NCAA will no longer allow SGLs to play professionally.)\nPrior to 2024, the league also had an ex-professional player limit, where teams are only allowed to sign a limited number of players with prior professional experience. This was replaced with an ex-PBA player limit in 2022, and in 2024, the limit was removed entirely.\nSeason format.\nPreseason.\nBefore the regular season begins, an invitational tournament is usually held as part of the preseason. The tournament is divided into two phases: the group stage and the playoffs. In the group stage, the participating teams are divided into multiple groups, where each team will play against their group opponents once. The top two teams of each group advance to a single-elimination playoffs.\nRegular season.\nThe regular season utilizes a single round-robin tournament format, where each team plays against all of the other teams once, regardless of division alignment. Two or three games are scheduled each day to be played in a single venue, thus a majority of the league's games are considered neutral-site games. The home team typically plays in the final game, although on some occasions, it may also be a neutral-site game. The league also schedules series of out-of-town games throughout the regular season, known as Invasion series, where consecutive gamedays take place in areas that league doesn't visit often, such as Visayas and Mindanao. Invasion series also covers the league's international games.\nNear the end of the regular season, the league holds its seasonal All-Star Game. Two teams representing the North and South Divisions are composed of fifteen players from each division, all of whom are declared as the season's all-stars. Alongside the All-Star Game are the various festivities held at the same day, including the Executives' Game, Three-Point Shootout, and Slam Dunk Contest.\nThe league uses FIBA rules for all of its games. Since 2022, teams are ranked by number of wins instead of winning percentage.\nPlayoffs.\nSince the 2018–19 season, top eight teams in each division advance to the playoffs. Should there be any ties, the league uses the standard FIBA tiebreaker criteria. \nIn the First Round or the Division Quarterfinals, the first seed matches with the eighth seed, the second seed with the seventh seed, the third seed with the sixth seed, and the fourth seed with the fifth seed. The Division Semifinals will then have the winner of the 1–8 series match with the winner of the 4–5 series, and the winner of the 2–7 series with the winner of the 3–6 series. The winners of both series then meet in the Division Finals. All three divisional rounds are played in best-of-three series.\nThe champions of each division will then meet in the final round, dubbed as the MPBL Finals or the MPBL National Finals, where the two teams play in a best-of-five series to determine the series champion.\nHomecourt advantage.\nDuring the first two rounds of the playoffs, two games from within the same division are played in the same gameday at the same venue. Because of this, a different system is used to determine homecourt advantage for those two rounds, shown in the table below. The Division Finals uses a 1–1–1 format, while the National Finals uses a 2–2–1 format.\nAwards.\nThe league also gives out its end-of-season awards during the National Finals, which includes the Most Valuable Player Award, which is awarded to the best performing player of the regular season.\nRight after the National Finals, the league also gives out the Finals Most Valuable Player Award to the best performing player of the series as well as the Coach of the Year to the head coach of the winning team.\nMedia coverage.\nThe MPBL employs its own broadcast team for all games, with the broadcast feed and commentary shared across all platforms.\nCurrent.\nSince 2022, Cignal TV holds the television broadcast rights to the MPBL and all of its games. As of 2024, all games are aired live on Media Pilipinas TV (MPTV). The games are also streamed on Cignal's Pilipinas Live streaming service. The league broadcasts all of the games online via its official Facebook page and YouTube channel.\nFormer.\nPrior to Cignal's current deal, ABS-CBN held the broadcast rights of the league from 2018 until 2021. Games during that time were broadcast on ABS-CBN, A2Z, S+A, Liga, and its various regional stations in local markets, The Filipino Channel broadcast the games for international markets, and iWantTFC streamed the games worldwide. These broadcast rights came to a halt due to the network's franchise renewal controversy, which forced the league to award the broadcast rights to a new network.\nOther networks which broadcast the MPBL before Cignal's tenure include Fox Sports Asia, which held the broadcast rights for Monday games throughout the 2018–19 season. Afterwards, it was the IBC broadcasting all games during the 2021 Invitational, with TAP DMV's TAP Go service streaming the games."

        "title": "Donald Trump and golf",
        "text": " \nDonald Trump is closely associated with the sport of golf. As a real estate developer, Trump began acquiring and constructing golf courses in 1999. By the time of his election as United States President in 2016, he owned 17 golf courses worldwide through his holding company, the Trump Organization. Courses owned by Trump have been selected to host various PGA and LPGA events, including the 2022 PGA Championship (although the PGA terminated this in the aftermath of the 2021 United States Capitol attack). A spokesman for the Trump Organization said that \"This is a breach of a binding contract and they have no right to terminate the agreement\".\nFollowing his election, Trump broke precedent with recent presidents and chose not to divest from his business holdings, including his golf courses. Although not illegal, this led to criticism from ethics lawyers and journalists for potential conflicts of interest. At least three lawsuits (\"D.C. and Maryland v. Trump\", \"Blumenthal v. Trump\" and \"CREW v. Trump\") were filed claiming that foreign payments at Trump golf courses and hotels violate the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The three lawsuits were dismissed as moot, dismissed for lack of standing, and allowed, respectively.\nBackground.\nTrump, according to Jack Nicklaus, \"loves the game of golf more than he loves money\". According to \"Golf Digest\", his handicap is as low as 2.8, a figure that sportswriter Rick Reilly dismisses at length in his book \"\". Trump began playing golf during his college years at the Fordham. In the introduction to his 2005 book \"The Best Golf Advice I Ever Received\", Trump wrote, \"for me and millions of people—men, women, young and old around the world—golf is more than a game. It is a passion.\"\nIn 1999, Trump opened his first golf course: the Trump International Golf Club, West Palm Beach in Florida. Land for the US$45 million course was acquired through a lawsuit against Palm Beach County, Florida, after Trump's purchase of the Mar-a-Lago resort. By 2007, Trump owned four courses around the US. Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Trump began purchasing existing golf courses and re-designing them.\nGolf courses owned by Trump hosted the LPGA Tour finale from 2001 to 2008, as well as the 2009 US Junior Amateur and US Junior Girls Championships. In 2014, the Professional Golfers' Association of America announced a multi-year partnership with the Trump Organization. The PGA of America selected Trump golf courses to host the 2017 Senior PGA Championship and the 2022 PGA Championship.\nIn June 2015, Trump announced his candidacy in the 2016 presidential election with a controversial speech which led to companies such as Macy's and NBC cutting ties with the businessman. While speaking on illegal immigration, Trump claimed that Mexico is \"sending people that have lots of problems... they're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people,\" drawing criticism from immigration and Latino advocacy groups. The LPGA, PGA of America, PGA Tour, and United States Golf Association issued a joint statement, saying that while the organizations \"do not usually comment on presidential politics, Mr. Trump's comments are inconsistent with our strong commitment to an inclusive and welcoming environment in the game of golf.\" The PGA of America also decided to relocate the 2015 PGA Grand Slam of Golf—an exhibition match which had been scheduled to take place at Trump National Golf Club, Los Angeles. In 2018, PGA Tour Latinoamérica held its Shell Tour Championship at Trump National Doral Miami's Golden Palm course after plans were announced to demolish the Melreese Country Club in Miami, which had held the event, for a football stadium.\nGolf courses owned.\nAs of December 2016, Trump owned golf courses in the United States and abroad. Over nearly two decades (as he reported in his 2000–2018 tax filings), these golf courses had combined losses of $315.6 million.\nGolf courses managed by the Trump Organization.\nThe Trump Organization also operates golf courses not owned by them.\nPuerto Rico.\nIn 2007, the Trump Organization took over the management and licensed Trump's name to the 4-year old, 36-hole oceanfront golf course at Coco Beach, Puerto Rico. It hosted the 2008 PGA Puerto Rico Open, but the club kept losing money and in 2015 filed for bankruptcy protection.\nDubai.\nAccording to the Trump Organization, it is neither the owner nor the developer of the Trump International Golf Club. The financial disclosures Trump filed with the Federal Election Commission in 2016 show that the Trump Organization manages the two golf courses in Dubai. The second Trump-branded golf course, the Trump World Golf Club, was designed by Tiger Woods and developed and built by DAMAC Properties, a company founded by Hussain Sajwani. It was scheduled to be opened in 2017, the year in which a report revealed that migrants working on the project were not being paid on time. In February 2021, it was announced that the inauguration was delayed at least until 2022, as the work on the project was paused. Some officials working on the construction project were told that the delay was because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but developers in the Emirates were reportedly struggling to finish such developments even before the global health crisis.\nFerry Point, New York.\nFrom 2015 to 2023, the Trump Organization operated the Trump Links at Ferry Point, New York, a public golf course built and owned by New York City, under a 20-year contract awarded in 2013 by the administration of then-Mayor Bloomberg. Under the agreement, the city paid the course's utility and water bills while collecting no income for the first four years. In the first year of operation, ending in March 2016, the company had $8 million in gross receipts, and the city paid $1 million in water and sewage bills. In the second year of operation, gross receipts dropped 9.5%. For the operating year that ended March 2019, the Trump Organization reported a loss of $122,000; it now faces contractual fees of at least $300,000 per operating year from the city.\nOn January 13, 2021, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city government would be terminating all contracts with the Trump Organization effective November 14, 2021, for \"directly incit[ing] a deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\" The city of New York also stated that the Trump Organization had defaulted in its contractual obligations because it had failed to attract a major tournament. In June 2021, the Trump Organization sued the city for wrongful termination of the contract. The court allowed the Trump Organization to continue operating the golf course while the case was pending. In April 2022, the judge ruled that \"the city had not given a valid legal reason for ending the contract.\"\nIn Septembert 2023, the Trump Organization sold the operating rights to gaming and entertainment company Bally's Corporation for $60 million. The course was renamed \"Bally Links\" in January 2024.\nCoats of arms.\nTrump has used a number of logos in the style of coats of arms for his businesses.\nJoseph E. Davies, third husband of Marjorie Merriweather Post and a former U.S. ambassador of Welsh origins, was granted a coat of arms, bearing the motto \"Integritas\", by British heraldic authorities in 1939. After Donald Trump purchased Mar-a-Lago, the Florida estate built by Merriweather Post, in 1985, the Trump Organization started using Davies's coat of arms at Trump golf courses and estates across the country. It was also registered with the U.S. patent and trademark office.\nIn 2008, Trump attempted to establish the American logo at his new Trump International Golf Links in Balmedie, Scotland, but was warned by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, the highest authority for Scottish heraldry, that an act of the Scottish Parliament from 1672 disallows people using unregistered arms. In January 2012, shortly after the inauguration of the golf course, Trump unveiled the new coat of arms that had been granted to \"The Trump International Golf Course Scotland Ltd\" by the Court of the Lord Lyon, Scotland's heraldic authority, in 2011.\nFrom 2014, Trump used the same logo for the Trump International Golf Links, Ireland, the golf resort built from his acquisition of Doonbeg Golf Club.\nPresidency.\nFollowing his election in 2016, Trump announced that he would not divest his business holdings, as other recent presidents had. Instead, Trump kept his ownership stake in the Trump Organization and appointed his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump to manage the business. In an unusual rebuke from the Office of Government Ethics, director Walter Shaub called Trump's actions \"wholly inadequate\" and \"meaningless from a conflict of interest perspective.\" In an interview with \"The New York Times\", Trump explained: \"As far as the, you know, potential conflict of interests, though, I mean I know that from the standpoint, the law is totally on my side, meaning, the president can’t have a conflict of interest.\"\nJust days after his inauguration, a lawsuit was filed in federal court seeking to block the president from receiving payments from foreign government entities at his businesses. The lawsuit alleged that these payments constitute a violation of the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution. In February 2017, Trump invited Prime Minister of Japan Shinzō Abe to play at the Trump International Golf Club in Florida and stay at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Legal and ethical concerns were raised by organizations such as the Sunlight Foundation over foreign payments Trump may receive from the visit. Trump has vowed to donate any such payments to the Treasury Department, although the specifics of this arrangement remain unclear. In June 2017, the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia filed a separate lawsuit, claiming Trump was \"flagrantly violating\" the Emoluments Clause.\nA 2016 investigation by \"USA Today\" found that lobbyists and corporate executives had been purchasing memberships at Trump golf courses to gain favor or contact with the president. Membership fees at Trump courses can exceed US$100,000, leading to ethical concerns over a sitting president accepting money from people lobbying the government.\nWhile campaigning to be president, Trump declared in August 2016: \"I'm going to be working for you. I'm not going to have time to play golf\". As president, the amount of time he spent golfing generated controversy. Despite having frequently criticized his predecessor Barack Obama for having played golf too much as president, Trump golfed 11 times during his first eight weeks in office, when Obama did not golf at all in his first eight weeks. \"Golf Digest\" concluded that Obama played 306 rounds of golf over his two terms, which the magazine describes as \"...a fairly remarkable amount of golf while in office\". Trump visited a Trump Organization property on 428 (nearly one in three) of the 1,461 days of his presidency and is estimated to have played 261 rounds of golf, one every 5.6 days.\nAccording to CNN, Trump visited Trump-owned golf courses 92 times between becoming president in January 2017 and January 3, 2018, although the White House did not disclose whether he played golf during a visit to a golf course. The White House on some occasions denied that Trump played golf during his visits even after photos published on social media showed him doing so. In November 2018, \"The Washington Post\" found that the average number of days between golf rounds was around 5 days for Trump, and around 12–13 days for Obama.\nJournalists and ethics experts have alleged that these frequent visits are a means of boosting publicity at the courses to sell more memberships. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended Trump's golfing, saying that his time on the course was spent \"developing deeper and better relationships with members of Congress in which those relationships have helped push forward the president's agenda.\" CNN reported in January 2018 that Trump was known to have played golf with members of Congress only seven times.\nVice President Mike Pence stayed at the Trump International Golf Links and Hotel Ireland in 2019 while meeting with Irish officials in Dublin. Pence was originally going to end his trip in Doonbeg, where he has familial ties, but Trump suggested that he stay at the Trump property instead, which required daily flights of a more than one hour each way."

        "text": "The Korea women's national ice hockey team is a representative side which is composed of players from both South Korea and North Korea.\nThe team competed at the 2018 Winter Olympics, competing as \"Korea\" under the IOC country code \"COR\".\nHistory.\nIn 2014, it was confirmed that Korea women's national ice hockey team had qualified to participate at the 2018 Winter Olympics as part of the host country. Their participation at the 2018 Winter Olympics had been their second appearance following their debut in the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, Japan.\nSouth Korea had proposed a unified team of the two Koreas at the Games. It was proposed that the team would participate at least in the women's ice hockey event and possibly more disciplines. The proposal came after North Korea competed in the Group A tournament of IIHF Women's World Championship Division II which was hosted in South Korea in April 2017. North Korea initially refused the proposal in June 2017 on the grounds of time constraints. However, an agreement was made with four weeks left before the Games commenced.\nOn 20 January 2018, the International Olympic Committee allowed a Unified Korean team to compete in the women's ice hockey event for the 2018 Winter Olympics under the \"Olympic Korean Peninsula Declaration\", allowing the team to compete as \"Korea\", using the acronym \"COR\". On 30 January 2018, the full roster of the unified Korean team was named.\nThe language difference of Korean spoken by players from South and North Korea became a challenge for the team during training. South and North Korea use different terminology in ice hockey and head coach Sarah Murray does not speak Korean and had to rely on her assistant and manager to communicate with the team's players.\nThe unified team played their first friendly match against Sweden on 4 February 2018 at the Seonhak International Ice Rink in Incheon before an audience of 3,000 people ahead of the Winter Olympics. They lost 1–3 to their European opposition. The Koreans scored their only goal during the first period. Four of the 22 players in the roster for that game were North Koreans.\nTeam image.\nThe anthem which plays when the Korea team plays in international ice hockey is the folk song \"Arirang\" instead of the national anthems of either South Korea or North Korea. The team's uniform features the silhouette of the Korean peninsula with the text \"Korea\".\nThere was some opposition to the formation of the team. Critics of the unified team believed that the team had less chance to win a medal compared to a team solely composed of South Koreans.\nTeam.\n2018 Winter Olympics roster.\nThe squad had a total of 35 players, more than other competing national teams at the Games although the IOC has mandated that only 22 players could play in each match \"with respect to fair play\" and that the coach must select at least three North Koreans to form the squad in each game."

The touring team, with ages on 1 January 1967, was:\nBuss was not in the original team. He replaced Abberley, who suffered a broken finger from a high full toss in the second match. The manager was the former Test player Les Ames.\nThe tour.\nIt was a tightly-packed schedule. Once the team started playing their first match they had only one day free from either match-play or travel until the end of the last match.\nAmiss top-scored in each innings for MCC Under-25 with 47 and 75. Hanif Mohammad, South Zone's captain, did the same for South Zone with 73 and 35 not out. Munawwar Hussain was the outstanding bowler, with 6 for 35 and 2 for 56.\nAbberley made the top score of the match with 92 in the first innings. Pocock took 4 for 44 and 5 for 70. Saeed Ahmed, Central Zone's captain, made 26 and 61 and took 3 for 91 and 5 for 60.\n\"A pitch of funereal pace virtually guaranteed a draw from the first ball,\" said the \"Wisden\" report. Mushtaq Mohammad batted nearly six hours for 120, Majid Khan made 100 not out, and Fletcher 124.\nBrearley scored 312 not out so rapidly that he was able to declare at stumps on the first day after five and a half hours of play. He put on 208 for the first wicket with Knott (101) and 234 unbroken for the fifth wicket with Ormrod (61 not out). North Zone succumbed to the bowling of Hutton, who took a hat-trick in the first innings, and Hobbs, who took 6 for 39 and 3 for 88.\nPocock took 4 for 56 and 4 for 36. Amiss made 102.\nBrearley (223) and Amiss (131) added 356 for the second wicket; Pervez Sajjad took 7 for 135 off 57.2 overs for Pakistan Under-25. Following on 212 behind, Pakistan Under-25 were 124 for 4 before a fifth wicket partnership of 167 in 145 minutes by Majid Khan (95) and the captain, Asif Iqbal (117).\nDespite the fastest pitch of the series the play was slow, and MCC Under-25 did not attempt to reach their target of 255 in 215 minutes. Mushtaq Mohammad took 7 for 73.\nLeading players.\nIn the three-match series, Brearley was the highest scorer on either side with 364 runs at an average of 121.33; Amiss made 284 at 94.66. Pocock took most wickets for MCC Under-25, with 10 at 36.30, and Hobbs had 9 at 36.55.\nFor Pakistan Asif Iqbal made 305 runs at 50.83 and Majid Khan made 284 at 56.80. Pervez Sajjad took 11 wickets at 20.63, and Mushtaq Mohammad 10 at 17.60.\nOn the tour as a whole, Brearley made 793 runs in the first-class matches at an average of 132.16, and Amiss made 575 at 63.88. The leading wicket-taker was Pocock, who took 31 at 20.29, while Hobbs took 27 at 25.66.\nAftermath.\nOnly Brown, Amiss and Underwood had played Test cricket before the tour. All except Abberley, Bissex, Buss, Ormrod and Windows played Tests after the tour.\nOn the Pakistan side, several of the team had already played Test cricket. Of the others, Wasim Bari played his first matches for Pakistan, and immediately established himself as his country's premier wicket-keeper, and Saleem Altaf also began his international career.\nAfter the tour, Brearley predicted that Pakistan's lack of fast bowlers, their batting difficulties against pace bowling on fast pitches, and their lack of a settled pair of opening batsmen, would all present problems for them on their forthcoming tour of England a few months later. All three predictions proved accurate, and Pakistan lost the Test series 2–0."

        "title": "KA Handball",
        "text": "Knattspyrnufélag Akureyrar is the handball section of Icelandic sports club KA from Akureyri. The team currently competes in the Úrvalsdeild karla, the top tier of handball in Iceland. They play their home matches at KA-heimilið. The team enjoyed a successful period in the late 90's and early 2000s becoming league Champions three times, cup winners three times and champions of Iceland two times. \nHistory.\nThe Alfreð Gíslason era (1991-1997).\nIn 1991 former KA player Alfreð Gíslason took charge of the team, he would lead the team to its most successful period in its history. The 1994–95 Season marked a significant chapter in the history of KA handball club. KA had strong players in Valdimar Grímsson and goalkeeper Sigmar Þröstur but now they were joined by one of the nation's most promising handball players, Patrekur Jóhannesson. The highlight of the season was the intense cup final against Valur. The match went into double overtime, with KA emerging victorious with a score of 27-26, claiming their first cup title. Patrekur Jóhannesson scored 11 goals for KA in the match. Valur got their revenge by beating KA in the final to become Icelandic champions. The following season Valdimar Grímsson would depart however their were notable acquisitions in Julian Duranona and Guðmundur Arnar Jónsson. KA made its European debut, the season culminated in triumphs, including a cup victory over Víkingur and the club's first league title. However, the team lost to Valur in the final playoff game to become Icelandic champions. Individual honors went to Julian Duranona as top scorer and Patrekur Jóhannesson as best defensive player. After the season Patrekur Jóhannesson would leave to Tusem Essen in his place KA would acquire the talents of Belarusian, Sergei Ziza. \nIn the 1996-1997 season, KA performs well in European matches, winning the series against Amiticia and Herstal and then with a notable victory against Fotex Vesprém, despite losing against them in the series. The team finished 3rd in the league and reached the playoff finals this time beating Afturelding to become Icelandic champions for the first time. They reached the cup finals for the fourth consecutive year, however, they lost to Haukar. Julian Duranona and Ziza shine throughout the season. At the end of the season Alfreð Gíslason departs, which marks the end of an era, but KA looks ahead with optimism, focusing on youth development and the continued success of the club. The KA club house and home-ground (KA-heimilið) becomes an integral part of the team's success, fostering a unique atmosphere during matches.\nBecoming Icelandic champions for the 2nd time (1997-2006).\nAlfreð's successor was Atli Hilmarsson. In his first season, 1997-1998, he would lead the team clinch the league title for the second time in their history. KA's success was unexpected to many, as they had undergone significant changes since last season. A key to KA's success at this time was the arrival of Guðjón Valur Sigurðsson in 1998, who came from Grótta's academy but had yet to play in the first teams. He would prove to be very successful winning the league's award for best player in 2000 and 2001. In the 2000-01 season, KA managed to become league champions for the third time and came second in the playoffs finals. \nIn 2002, the KA team reached he final of playoffs in a match against Valur for the Icelandic handball championship. The KA team lost the first two games and was therefore in a very difficult position as Valur only needed one more win to secure the title. However, KA won the next two matches and forced a tiebreaker. The game ended with a KA victory bringing them their second Icelandic champions title, with player Halldór Jóhann Sigfússon being key to KA's success. Atli Hilmarsson had declared that this would be his last season as manager.\nFrom 2002 to 2005, Jóhannes Gunnar Bjarnason managed KA, with the team experiencing less success compared to previous years. A highlight was their victory against Fram in the Icelandic cup in 2004, securing KA's third cup win. Andrius Stelmokas was named the league's best player in 2003, while young Arnór Atlason emerged as a key player, winning both the best player and best young player awards in 2004.\nAkureyri Handball club (2006-2017).\nFrom 2006 to 2017, KA and rival team from Akureyri, Þór, fielded a joint first-team in the Úrvalsdeild karla, the team was called Akureyri Handboltafélag. The team achieved it's best result in 2011 finishing as the runner-up in the Icelandic Cup and reaching the Úrvalsdeild finals where it lost to FH. In 2017, the club was relegated from the Úrvalsdeild and shortly after, KA decided to break off from the cooperation and field their own team starting from 2017–2018.\nKA's handball section reinstated (2017-).\nIn 2017, KA resumed playing under its own emblem in men's handball after competing under the banner of Akureyri Handboltafélag since 2006. Stefán Árnason coached the men's championship team, competing in the second division. They secured second place in the league, earning a spot in the top flight.\nOver the following years, the team established itself in the top tier, albeit with mixed results. In their inaugural two seasons, they secured 9th place in 2018/19 and 10th place in 2019/2020. In the 2020/21 season Jónatan Magnússon took solely over as manager of the team. KA finished 6th in the league, marking their first playoff qualification since their reinstatement. However, they were eliminated by Valur in the first round, ending their playoff journey. Árni Bragi Eyjólfsson, a KA player, had an outstanding season, winning the league's Best Player award and finishing as the top scorer. The subsequent season saw KA secure 7th place, only to be knocked out in the first round by Haukar. This marked the second consecutive season where a KA player claimed the league's top scorer title, this time being Óðinn Þór Ríkharðsson. In the cup competition that year, KA enjoyed success, reaching the final but ultimately losing to Valur. Moving on to the 2022/23 season, KA competed in the EHF European Cup, exiting in the first round against HC Fivers. Domestically, the team battled relegation, finishing 10th in the league, ultimately parting ways with manager Jónatan Magnússon. For the third cconsecutive year in a row a KA player was the top scorer in the league as Einar Rafn Eiðsson claimed the title.\nIn 2023 Halldór Stefán Haraldsson was appointed head-coach of the team.\nWomen's team.\nKA currently has a joint women's team with Þór Akureyri. It goes by the name KA/Þór and as of 2018-2019 season plays in the first tier."

The budget release published by Blue Ribbon Software reached the top of the UK charts in May 1988. \"Steve Davis Snooker\" simulates the cue sport snooker. Released under licence from 6-time Snooker World Champion, Steve Davis.\nThe game is the first to feature a license of a professional snooker player, with later Jimmy White creating the . CDS called the game the \"ultimate successor\" to their 1983 pool simulator, titled \"Pool\". Davis would also be involved with the 1989 follow-up \"Steve Davis World Snooker,\" as well as 1996's \"Virtual Snooker.\"\nOverview.\n\"Steve Davis Snooker\" allows players to play against themselves, or against a human opponent in either Snooker, or Pool. However, there is no opponent AI. The game could be controlled by either a Joypad or a Cursor and Keyboard control scheme. The game has two different modes, with a \"short game\" (a game of Ten-Red Snooker similar to power snooker), or \"long game\", a game of traditional fifteen-red Snooker.\nThe Atari game's box art boasts that the game has a \"trick shot edit mode\", \"accurate spin\", and \"friction factor.\" \nReception.\nCritical reception for the game was generally high, with Zzap! magazine scoring the Commodore 64 game at 79% commenting \"Steve Davis Snooker is the best version of the sport I have ever seen on the 64, with its excellent approach and options helping make it so if you're a snooker fan or you want to try something different from your everyday shoot em up, then this makes a worthy and refreshing change.\" Commodore Format also mentioned the game in a review, scoring the game at 70% before stating that whilst Snooker was a \"hideously dull game\", the game was a \"nice conversion.\"\nCrash Magazine also reviewed the game for the ZX Spectrum, scoring the game at 77% saying \"A very good, user-friendly simulation, which (possibly for the first time) really calls on skill.\" Sinclair User were also positive with the game, scoring the game at 7/10, but did cite the lack of a mechanic in game as an oversight.\nCommodore User gave the game 60%, commenting that the game's developer were \"too ambitious this time\", commenting on the game's downgrade in the port from the Commodore 64 to the Commodore 16. However \"If you're a dedicated afficionado [sic] then Steve Davis will no doubt appeal to you.\"\nSequel.\nAn updated version of the game would be released in 1989 for the Amiga and Atari ST, known as \"Steve Davis World Snooker\". The game featured similar gameplay as that of the original, however, also included AI opponents, and improved graphical designs. The game also features additional modes, such as eight-ball and nine-ball pool, with billiards."

Hosted by University of Santo Tomas, the FEU Tamaraws defeated the back-to-back defending champions UE Warriors in the finals taking their ninth overall UAAP men's basketball championship.\nFinals.\nThe score was 55–69 with ten minutes remaining in the second half.\nThere was that encounter under the goal when Marte Saldana of FEU and Jaime Manansala of UE practically embraced each other trying to get ahead in reaching for the ball. Later, Ramon Cruz of UE intercepted Anthony Dasalla's pass to a teammate and he scored for two. The score was 61–76, with FEU still ahead. Then Rico Acuna unstoppable, did a running lay-up and UE scored 63. Until Valencia got a foul and made the couple of shots from the foul line.\nWith three minutes remaining in the second half, Alex Tan of UE and Marte Saldana jumped for the ball and soon, American Michael Manyak upped UE's score to 76 with FEU still ahead by 10 points. With one minute forty seconds, Saldana was fouled by a UE player. He went to the top of the keyhole, made ready to shoot. Saldana made one out of two. Again, Manyak shot and brought the score to 78 for UE. At this juncture, it was a frenetic, seemingly no-holds-barred game since clock was fast ticking and end was nearing. Full-court press were evident.\nThen Valencia of FEU, seemingly irritated by Cruz of UE, was on the verge of throwing a punch when the referee spotted him and caught him in the act. With Valencia thrown out of the game, the Tamaraws lost someone vitally needed at the game's closing. With the score 78–87, and with only a minute left and 20 seconds, the contest took on additional fury.\nIt was then the not-so-tall Danilo Manalastas was sent in by FEU and he was unstoppable. When the final score was chalked, 82–91, the sudden deafening eruption of jubilation from the crowd was a fitting climax to FEU's ending the two-year reign of the Warriors and garnering the elusive title for the third time in the last five years."

Frimpong was the first Olympian from West Africa to participate in the skeleton event as well as the first black Olympian to represent an African country in the sport.\nWhile the Ghana Olympic Committee (GOC) secured a monthly $1,500 allowance for Frimpong, Ghanaian chef de mission Ahmed looked for corporate sponsors to fund an additional $57,000 needed for Ghana's participation in the Games and reasoned that the Ghanaian government was already burdened due to time constraints. Local firm, \"Cocoa from Ghana\" donated $25,000 to the GOC.\nCompetitors.\nThe following is the list of number of competitors participating at the Games per sport/discipline.\nSkeleton.\nGhana qualified one male skeleton athlete.

The Fighting Irish, led by thirty-first year head coach Muffet McGraw, played their home games at Edmund P. Joyce Center as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference. McGraw was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame at the start of the season. The Irish finished the season 35–3, 15–1 in ACC play to earn a share of the regular season championship. They defeated Virginia and Florida State before losing to Louisville in the ACC Women's Tournament championship. They received an at-large bid as the No. 1 seed in the Spokane region. They defeated Cal State Northridge and Villanova to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. There they defeated Texas A&amp;M and Oregon to advance to the Final Four. After upsetting then-unbeaten Connecticut 91–89 in overtime in the Final Four, Notre Dame played Mississippi State in the national championship. The Irish edged the Bulldogs 61–58 by Arike Ogunbowale's three-pointer with 0.1 seconds left on the clock, capturing their second national title in 18 years. The Irish became the first team in NCAA Women's Basketball history to trail by double digits in both the semifinal and National Championship games and come back to win.\nDespite the team's record, its appearance in the championship game was seen as surprising because of its severely depleted roster. Two players missed the entire season to torn ACLs, and two others were lost to the same injury in December; this rash of injuries left the Irish with only seven scholarship players. Brianna Turner, an All-American forward in 2016–17, was injured in the 2017 NCAA tournament; senior guard Mychal Johnson was lost in a preseason practice, freshman center Mikayla Vaughn only played 6 games; and starting senior point guard Lili Thompson was lost on New Year's Eve. Before the championship game, McGraw told media, \"I didn't think we'd have more ACL tears than losses. I think it's just an amazing accomplishment for this team and the resilience they've shown all year.\"\nMedia.\nAll Notre Dame games will air on WHPZ Pulse 96.9 FM.

        "title": "Baseball in the Dominican Republic",
        "text": "Baseball is the most popular sport in the Dominican Republic. It is a major sport in the country, and was introduced in the late-19th century in the city of San Pedro de Macorís by Cuban immigrants. After the United States, the Dominican Republic has the second-highest number of baseball players in Major League Baseball (MLB). The Dominican Republic national baseball team has won the Baseball World Cup in 1948 and the World Baseball Classic in 2013.\nHistory.\nDuring the 1870s, many Cuban citizens fled Cuba because of the Ten Years' War. Many relocated to the Dominican Republic, bringing with them the sport of baseball. The nation's expert class was established in 1890. The first clubs were Ozama and Nuevo. On 7 November 1907, the Licey club was established in Santo Domingo. By the 1930s, it had developed into a major source for gifted players whose guardians frequently worked at sugar refineries. In 1937, Negro league stars from the United States including Satchel Paige came to the country. In the mid-1950s Rafael Trujillo built the main stadium. Dominican players initially began migrating to the U.S. to play for Major League Baseball, starting with utility infielder Ozzie Virgil.\nCultural impact.\nNot only did baseball help strengthen the Dominican Republic's relationship with the United States, but it also had a massive effect on the culture of the Dominican Republic as a whole. Nowadays, baseball symbolizes a dream and hope for a better future for aspiring athletes and helps unite baseball fans (old and new) across several Spanish-speaking countries. The rise of baseball in the Dominican Republic has also had a massive impact on the economy of the country as a whole, generating around $1 billion per year via training facilities and professional games.\n1951–present.\nA summer baseball league began in 1951. In the 1955–56 season, it joined the professional association. Since then, the league has attracted many top players from the major leagues. Beginning in the 1955 season, the country's international presence grew attracting global attention. As of 2015 opening day, Dominicans were 83 of Major League Baseball's 868 players. At the beginning of the 2016 season, no country other than the United States contributed as many.\nThe Dominican Republic's Professional Baseball League LIDOM by its acronym in Spanish, hosts yearly winter games across the country. It consists of 6 teams, and it is the highest level of professional baseball played in the Dominican Republic.\nChampionships.\nEvery year at the end of the summer season, the two tops teams from that season face off at La Normal Stadium. This has been a major cultural event in the Dominican Republic, drawing in thousands of eager fans. Find more information on the winners of these playoff games in the table below:\nBaseball academies.\nBaseball academies are how Major League Baseball recruiters develop the talent they find across all Latin America. In 1987, the Los Angeles Dodgers were the first MLB club to establish a baseball academy in the Dominican Republic when they opened the doors to Campo Las Palmas. Now, every single one of the teams in the MLB has a baseball academy in the Dominican Republic.\nWith four out of every ten Dominicans living in poverty, baseball has become a small beacon of hope for many Dominican families. The baseball academies in the Dominican Republic offer many young boys what may be their and their family's only chance of overcoming poverty, and as a result many boys as young as age 10 drop out of school to focus all of their attention on baseball and someday playing for an MLB team. However, it is estimated that only two percent of Dominican recruits are actually able to make a living playing in MLB, leaving many of these young recruits finding themselves aged 19–21 with no education, no work skills, and no job prospects. Joe Kehoskie, a former baseball agent, described the situation in the 2001 PBS documentary, \"\":\nBecause of this, many baseball academies in the country have made efforts to incorporate educational programs that teach English and financial skills to their recruits, to better prepare them for the future. For instance, the Arizona Diamondbacks' baseball academy, ran by former major league player Junior Noboa, is committed to helping their players complete at least their high school education, even if they are released from their team.\nNotables.\nThe list of notable names continues to grow each year and includes some major history-making players including: Juan Marichal, Felipe Alou, Bartolo Colón, Tony Fernandez and others. Some more recent and recognizable, Major League Baseball names include:\nPedro Martínez.\nPedro Martínez, from Manoguayabo, was a Major League Baseball player from 1992 to 2009. He played for five teams and was best known for his tenure with the Boston Red Sox, joining with Ortiz to help them win the World Series in 2004. From 2002 to 2006, Martínez held the league record for the highest career winning percentage by a pitcher. He won three Cy Young Awards and was the first Latin American pitcher to achieve at least 300 strikeouts in a season and 3,000 in a career. Martínez reached the 3,000 strikeout mark in fewer pitches than any pitcher other than Randy Johnson. Martínez was the only pitcher to acquire 3,000 strikeouts with fewer than 3,000 innings pitched.\nMartínez became a U.S. citizen in April 2006. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2015.\nSammy Sosa.\nSammy Sosa was born on 12 November 1968 in San Pedro de Macorís. Sosa was a slugger and had his best years while he played for the Chicago Cubs. Sosa influenced many Dominicans and is best known for his record-breaking season in which he hit 61 home runs.\nDavid Ortiz.\nDavid Ortiz arrived in MLB in 1997, experiencing injuries that slowed his progress. Ortiz signed with the Boston Red Sox in 2003 but did not play much until he became their designated hitter later that year. In 2004, Ortiz became known globally for his achievements. During the 2004 season, he hit 41 home runs and had 139 RBIs while batting .301. He joined with Martinez to lead the Boston Red Sox to their first World Series Championship in 86 years.\nRobinson Canó.\nRobinson Canó is a professional second baseman baseball player, born on 22 October 1982 in San Pedro de Macorís. At a young age, Canó knew he wanted to become a baseball player. He was first signed by the New York Yankees as a free agent in 2001, at the age of 18. Since then, Canó has played with the Seattle Mariners and on 3 December 2018, was traded to the New York Mets on a five-year contract."

        "title": "2018 Novak Djokovic tennis season",
        "text": "The 2018 Novak Djokovic tennis season started with the Tie Break Tens event in Melbourne, Australia.\nYearly summary.\nEarly Hard Court Season.\nTie Break Tens.\nDjokovic returned from his six-month injury hiatus since 2017 Wimbledon Championships at the Tie Break Tens event where he played a tune-up for the 2018 Australian Open. He was defeated by Lleyton Hewitt in his first match, 10–6.\nAustralian Open.\nDjokovic played his first official match since Wimbledon at the Australian Open. After defeating Donald Young in straight sets, he defeated Gaël Monfils in the second round after dropping the first set, with Monfils succumbing to extreme heat in the latter stages of the match. With a victory over Albert Ramos Viñolas in third round, Djokovic set up a meeting with Korean Chung Hyeon. In a match of constant breaks of serve, Djokovic eventually lost in straight sets due to relentless backcourt defense from Chung and copious unforced errors on critical points. After his loss, Djokovic decided to undergo a surgery on his right elbow, which he claimed was affecting him from previous two years.\nIndian Wells Masters.\nDjokovic surprisingly returned to tour since his surgery at the Indian Wells Masters. After receiving a first round bye, he was upset in the second round by World No. 109 Taro Daniel in three sets.\nMiami Open.\nDjokovic's next event was at the Miami Open, where his spring slump continued as he lost to Benoît Paire in straight sets.\nClay Court Season.\nMonte Carlo Masters.\nHoping to regain form at the clay court events, Djokovic played at the Monte Carlo Masters. He won his first two matches in straight sets, defeating Dušan Lajović and Borna Ćorić in first and second rounds respectively. His 6–0, 6–1 win over Lajović was particularly dominant and suggested significant improvements in form. He needed 10 match points to beat Coric in round 2. In the third round, he lost to World No. 7 and clay court specialist Dominic Thiem. After the match, Djokovic stated : \"After two years finally I can play without pain\".\nBarcelona Open.\nInspired by his improvement, Djokovic took a wildcard to play at Barcelona Open He was unable to carry on his run there, and lost to Martin Klizan in his opening round match.\nMadrid Open.\nDjokovic next competed at the Madrid Open. In his first victory over a top-20 opponent in over eight months, he defeated former World No. 5 Kei Nishikori in the first round, before falling to Briton Kyle Edmund. As a result of the loss and failing to defend his semifinals position at the event, Djokovic fell to No. 18, his lowest ranking in twelve years.\nItalian Open.\nDjokovic's next event was the Italian Open, where he has previously won four times and was the defending finalist. He progressed to his first quarterfinals appearance since 2017 Wimbledon, defeating Alexandr Dolgopolov, Nikoloz Basilashvili and Albert Ramos in straight sets. He would go on to beat Kei Nishikori, but lose to eventual champion Rafael Nadal in the semifinal. After failing to defend his finalist points from 2017, Djokovic's ranking fell to No. 22. This was his first time out of the top 20 since October 2006.\nFrench Open.\nIn Roland Garros, Djokovic beat Roberto Bautista Agut and Fernando Verdasco en route to the quarterfinals, where he suffered a shocking defeat to Marco Cecchinato in four sets.\nGrass Court Season.\nQueen's Club.\nDjokovic took a wildcard to play at Queen's Club for the first time since 2010. He beat second seed Grigor Dimitrov, Adrian Mannarino, and Jérémy Chardy to reach the final. In the final, he lost to Marin Čilić in three sets, despite holding a match point.\nWimbledon.\nShowing further improvement in form, Djokovic beat Australian Open quarter-finalist Tennys Sandgren, British number one Kyle Edmund, and Kei Nishikori to set up a semifinal against Rafael Nadal. In the second longest Wimbledon semifinal to date (second only to the first semifinal between Isner and Anderson), Djokovic beat Nadal in five sets played over two days due to Wimbledons 11pm curfew and the first semifinal delaying the start of the Djokovic Nadal semifinal to after 8PM local time.\nHe then defeated Kevin Anderson in the final in straight sets to win his fourth Wimbledon title and 13th overall Grand Slam title. This was his first title of the season, which catapulted him from 21st back into the 10th spot in the rankings. He also became the lowest ranked male player to win a Wimbledon title since Goran Ivanišević won it in 2001 as a wildcard.\nUS Open Series.\nCanadian Open.\nDjokovic started his US Open series campaign with straightforward wins against Mirza Bašić and Peter Polansky in Toronto, but fell in the third round to Stefanos Tsitsipas.\nCincinnati Masters.\nNext for Djokovic was the Cincinnati Masters, the only Masters 1000 tournament he hadn't won. After beating Steve Johnson in straight sets, Djokovic faced several difficult matches in a row. He had to come back from a one-set deficit against Adrian Mannarino and ATP number 5 Grigor Dimitrov, and needed three sets to beat Milos Raonic in the quarterfinals and Marin Čilić in the semifinals.\nDjokovic then beat top-seeded and number 2 ranked Roger Federer in straight sets in the final. It was their first match since their semifinal match at the 2016 Australian Open. With this win, Djokovic became the first singles player to complete the Career Golden Masters.\nUS Open.\nStruggling with the heat and humidity, Djokovic survived an upset scare and beat Márton Fucsovics in four sets in the first round. He would again need four sets to overcome Tennys Sandgren in the second round. With cooler conditions, the next rounds proved to be easier: Richard Gasquet in the third round, João Sousa, and John Millman in the quarterfinal were all defeated in straight sets.\nHe would then face Kei Nishikori in their first match at the US Open since Nishikori's upset over Djokovic in 2014. This time Djokovic prevailed in straight sets to set up a final against Juan Martín del Potro. In the final, Djokovic took control of the match early, winning the first set and securing a break early in the second. However, a spirited comeback from del Potro prolonged the second set, with Djokovic winning in a tiebreaker after a 95-minute set. Djokovic eventually closed out the match in straight sets.\nThe victory earned Djokovic his third US Open and 14th Grand Slam title overall, tying Pete Sampras. He also climbed back to number 3 in the ATP rankings and qualified for the ATP Finals.\nFall hard court season.\nShanghai Masters.\nSeeded second at the Shanghai Masters, he defeated Jérémy Chardy, 16th seed Marco Cecchinato, 7th seed Kevin Anderson, 4th seed Alexander Zverev, and 13th seed Borna Ćorić in a decisive run. He did not drop a set nor have his serve broken during the tournament. This was his fourth title in Shanghai and second Masters title of the year. With this win, he overtook Roger Federer and returned to the #2 ranking for the first time since the 2017 French Open.\nParis Masters.\nDjokovic defeated João Sousa, Damir Džumhur, Marin Čilić, and his rival Roger Federer en route to the final, where he lost in straight sets to Karen Khachanov.\nHowever, with Rafael Nadal's withdrawal from the tournament, Djokovic regained the No. 1 ranking after the tournament concluded. It was exactly two years ago when he lost the No. 1 ranking in Paris, following a quarterfinals exit.\nATP Finals.\nDjokovic easily qualified for the semifinals, winning all 3 of his round robin matches in straight sets and without losing serve. He defeated John Isner, Sascha Zverev and Marin Cilic. In the semifinals he defeated Wimbledon runner up Kevin Anderson in straight sets. In the final he faced Sascha Zverev, who Djokovic beat four days earlier in round robin play. This time Zverev came out on top in straight sets for his first ATP Finals title.\nAll matches.\nThis table lists all the matches of Djokovic this year, including walkovers W/O (they are marked ND for non-decision)\nYearly records.\nHead-to-head matchups.\nNovak Djokovic has a ATP match win–loss record in the 2018 season. His record against players who were part of the ATP rankings Top Ten at the time of their meetings is . Bold indicates player was ranked top 10 at the time of at least one meeting.

        "title": "History of English cricket (1919–1945)",
        "text": "English cricket was completely disrupted by World War I and there were no first-class matches after August 1914 until May 1919. A similar situation arose in World War II with a shutdown of first-class cricket from September 1939 until the summer of 1945 when eleven matches were specially arranged; cricket returned to normal in 1946 with a full domestic programme and a Test series against India.\nIn the 21 seasons between the wars, England took part in 120 Test matches as part of fifteen home and thirteen away series. Several other first-class tours were organised by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and private individuals like Sir Julien Cahn and Lionel Tennyson. Against Australia in The Ashes, England won in 1926 and successfully defended them in 1928–29 but thereafter had to face the formidable challenge of Don Bradman, whose heavy scoring was the key difference between England and Australia through the 1930s. Under the captaincy of Douglas Jardine in 1932–33, England controversially deployed so-called \"leg theory\", better known as \"bodyline\", in order to regain The Ashes but almost caused an international incident in doing so.\nDomestically, the only major tournament was the County Championship which in this period was mostly dominated by Yorkshire and Lancashire. Between them, they won seventeen of the 21 titles at stake and the \"Roses Match\" became the most significant domestic fixture of the English season. Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire won one title each and so Middlesex, with two, were the only southern champions of the inter-war period. Other domestic fixtures of note were the Champion County match (annual to 1935), Gentlemen v Players (annual), North v South (ten matches in nine seasons) and the University Match (annual).\nLeading English players of the inter-war years included Wilfred Rhodes, Jack Hobbs, Frank Woolley, Herbert Strudwick, Patsy Hendren, Tich Freeman, Maurice Tate, Herbert Sutcliffe, George Duckworth, Harold Larwood, Wally Hammond, Maurice Leyland, Les Ames, Hedley Verity, Len Hutton and Denis Compton.\nPost-war recovery (1919–1921).\nAfter the end of World War I in November 1918, the English cricket authorities were determined to arrange a full County Championship programme for the 1919 season and, despite calls for radical innovation, to change things \"as little as possible\". The only change of note that they did introduce was the two-day match, instead of three-day, and this was soon acknowledged to have been a colossal mistake. The three-day match was restored in 1920.\nThe county clubs faced many problems in dealing with post-war recovery. Their overall handling of the 1919 County Championship was not viewed in a favourable light by \"Wisden\" and many others, especially the rash decision to introduce a two-day match format. This was short-lived and three-day matches were reinstated ahead of the 1920 season.\nOne of the main concerns of the counties in 1919 was who would be able to play for their teams as the war had taken a heavy toll of first-class cricketers. Much depended on the availability of pre-war players who could resume their careers and on finding new talent.\nInternational cricket.\nMarylebone Cricket Club (MCC) remained the controlling body in English cricket throughout the inter-war period and was responsible for the selection and management of the England cricket team. Australia were England's main rivals and The Ashes were contested in ten series between 1921 and 1938, five in England and five in Australia, most famously in the \"Bodyline\" series of 1932–33. England played three home series against South Africa and four in South Africa including their last overseas tour before the Second World War. In 1919, the International Cricket Conference had only its three original full members (Australia, England and South Africa). The membership and, hence, the number of countries able to play Test cricket doubled on 31 May 1926 with the promotions of India, New Zealand and the West Indies to full member status. England played each of these teams for the first time in the next few seasons. To 1939, there were three England v India series, two in England and one in India; four England v New Zealand series, two in each country; and five England v West Indies series, three of them in England.\nEngland v Australia.\nEngland were outclassed by Australia in the first two series after the war but, by the middle of the 1920s, they had a team good enough to win and retain the Ashes. Don Bradman dominated the 1930 series and Douglas Jardine used the leg theory stratagem in 1932–33 to try to curb Bradman's massive run-scoring. It worked and England recovered the Ashes, but at enormous cost of cricketing prestige. With leg theory in disgrace, normal cricket resumed in 1934. Australia won back the Ashes and aside from a draw in 1938 kept them until 1953, though England made a real fight of it in each of the 1934, 1936–37 and 1938 series.\nEngland v South Africa.\nEngland and South Africa were quite well matched throughout this period and both teams enjoyed series wins at home and away. The last match between them before the war was the famous \"Timeless Test\" at Kingsmead in March 1939. Despite the intention to play to a finish, it was agreed after nine days on the field to call it a draw, so that the England team could catch their boat home.\nEngland v India.\nEngland played India for the first time in 1932 when a single Test was staged. England won that match and then won 2–0 in each of two three-match series (home and away) over the next four years.\nEngland v New Zealand.\nEngland's first Test series against New Zealand was in 1929–30. There were three more before the war and, though England won all four series, the majority of matches were drawn and New Zealand did not win any.\nEngland v West Indies.\nEngland's first Test against West Indies was in 1928. Five series were played before the war including the one in 1939 which had just finished when the international crisis arose. England were mostly successful against West Indies but not in 1934–35 when the home team recorded a 2–1 series victory.\nThe County Championship.\nThe inter-war period in the County Championship was dominated by the northern clubs. Yorkshire had won the two-day version in 1919 but then there was brief southern success with back-to-back victories by Middlesex in 1920 and 1921. In 1922, Yorkshire won the first of four successive titles to 1925. It was during the 1920s that the \"Roses Match\" was the most significant domestic fixture and Lancashire won four of the next five championships, their run interrupted by Nottinghamshire in 1929. Starting in 1931, Yorkshire won seven out of nine competitions to 1939, the other two titles going to Lancashire in 1934 and to the fourth northern club Derbyshire in 1936.\nThere was only one addition to the County Championship between the wars, Glamorgan becoming the 17th county in 1921. Worcestershire did not compete in 1919 but rejoined for the 1920 season.\nDerbyshire.\nIn 1919, Derbyshire welcomed back Billy Bestwick, Samuel Cadman, Arthur Morton, Joseph Bowden, Archibald Slater and James Horsley. Their best new player in 1919 was Guy Jackson. The team struggled that season and were placed tenth, winning three and losing nine of their fourteen matches.\nDerbyshire had a disastrous season in 1920, losing seventeen of their eighteen matches, and struggled for most of the 1920s with another winless season in 1924. Gradually, they assembled a strong team and, by 1927, they had a decent side which finished fifth and commanded respect. Harry Elliott, Jim Hutchinson and Harry Storer junior all made their debuts in 1920 and, over the next five years, the team welcomed Leslie Townsend, Stan Worthington and Garnet Lee. Denis Smith, who has one of the longest first-class careers on record, first appeared in 1927. Albert Alderman began in 1928 and then the team really took shape as Derbyshire discovered Tommy Mitchell, Alf Pope, Bill Copson, Charlie Elliott and George Pope. From 1928 to 1933, the team was always in mid-table.\nThe team finally realised its potential and finished third behind Lancashire in 1934 and second behind Yorkshire in 1935. The 1936 championship-winning team was captained by A. W. Richardson and its key players were the main bowlers Copson, Mitchell, Alf Pope and all-rounder Townsend. Wicket-keeper Harry Elliott, very effective in combination with Mitchell, accounted for 62 batsmen. Four batsmen scored over 1,000 championship runs: Townsend, Worthington, Smith and Alderman. Derbyshire finished third in 1937, when Dusty Rhodes made his debut, and a creditable fifth in 1938 but then dropped back to mid-table in 1939. The promising pace bowler Cliff Gladwin made his debut in 1939 and played four times that season. Gladwin went on to play for England in the 1940s and form a formidable partnership for Derbyshire with Les Jackson.\nEssex.\nEssex could win only two of their eighteen two-day matches in the 1919 championship, twelve others ending in draws. They were placed fourteenth in the final, percentage-based table. There was a much improved performance in 1920 when, with nine wins and nine defeats, the team moved into mid-table. Essex generally struggled through the 1920s and were never more than a mid-table team. They were close to the wooden spoon in 1928 when only the winless Worcestershire had a worse record. In 1930, Ken Farnes made his debut and Essex climbed to sixth place. Two losing seasons followed and then the team reached fourth in 1933 before slipping back into mid-table for the next three years. For the last three seasons before the Second World War, Essex were one of the country's better teams and finished sixth, sixth and fourth successively.\nReturning Essex players in 1919 included Percy Perrin, Johnny Douglas, Frank Gillingham, John Freeman, Jack Russell, George Louden and Joseph Dixon. Their best new player was Whiz Morris. Laurie Eastman made his debut in 1920. New players from 1921 to 1928 included Claude Ashton, Jack O'Connor, Joe Hipkin, Jim Cutmore, Stan Nichols, Arthur Daer, Leonard Crawley, Charles Bray, Dudley Pope and Denys Wilcox. In 1929, the tide began to turn as Essex became more competitive and, more importantly, were able to introduce four players with great potential in Tom Pearce, Roy Sheffield, Peter Smith and Tom Wade. In the early 1930s, new players included Reginald Taylor, Victor Evans, Hopper Read, Ray Smith, John Stephenson and Sonny Avery.\nGlamorgan.\nGlamorgan joined the County Championship in 1921 and remain the only non-English member. First-class cricket gave Glamorgan a tough baptism and they finished bottom in their first championship season, winning only two of their eighteen matches. They were in the penultimate position in both 1922 and 1923. In their first three seasons, they won five matches but doubled that total in 1924 and moved up the table to thirteenth. They were bottom again in 1925 and were usually one of the bottom three teams from then to 1939. Their best seasons were 1926 and 1937 when they were eighth and seventh respectively.\nThe 1921 team included Trevor Arnott, William Bates, Johnnie Clay, Harry Creber, Stamford Hacker, Jack Nash and Norman Riches. Among the players they introduced through these first nineteen seasons were Jack Mercer, Dai Davies, Cyril Walters, Emrys Davies, Maurice Turnbull, Arnold Dyson, George Lavis, Haydn Davies, Phil Clift, Willie Jones, Wilf Wooller and Allan Watkins.\nGloucestershire.\nGloucestershire were generally competitive through the period and there was one season in particular, 1930, when they were very close to winning the championship under the captaincy of the charismatic Bev Lyon. They won fifteen of their 28 matches, five more than champions Lancashire, but finished second because they gained first innings lead points twice against Lancashire's eight, which left them with a three-point deficit in the final table. They were runners-up again in 1931, behind Yorkshire, but this time the gap was considerable.\nGloucestershire's greatest player of the inter-war years was the England batsman Wally Hammond and they had three outstanding bowlers in Charlie Parker, Tom Goddard and Reg Sinfield. Other accomplished players were batsmen Charlie Barnett and Alf Dipper; and wicket-keeper Harry Smith.\nHampshire.\nHampshire were never in title contention between the wars. They were a perennial mid-table team through the 1920s but had a weaker side in the 1930s when they always finished in the bottom half.\nTheir outstanding player was the prolific run-scorer Phil Mead and other good batsmen were George Brown and Johnny Arnold. The best bowlers were Alec Kennedy, Jack Newman and Lofty Herman. Behind the stumps, Hampshire were well served by Walter Livsey, Neil McCorkell and, when required, by Brown too.\nKent.\nIn the decade before the First World War, Kent had one of the best teams in the country. They were narrowly beaten on percentage by Yorkshire for the 1919 Championship but, given that they played only 14 games and Yorkshire played 26, Roy Webber declared Yorkshire's title to be \"just\". That was the closest Kent got to winning an inter-war title but they were always a top half team until 1935 when they slipped to tenth. Their lowest position was twelfth in 1937 but they were back up to fifth in 1939. Kent were one of the most consistent teams of the period but never quite good enough to challenge the northern counties.\nTheir outstanding players between the wars were all-rounder Frank Woolley, wicket-keeper/batsman Les Ames and leg break bowler Tich Freeman.\nLancashire.\nLancashire enjoyed the most successful period of their history in the late 1920s. They won the championship five times in nine seasons between 1926 and 1934. They forged a famous rivalry with neighbours Yorkshire which elevated the \"Roses Match\" to the status of England's greatest domestic fixture. In the whole inter-war period, there were only two seasons (1936 and 1937) in which Lancashire finished outside the top six.\nAlthough the county had numerous quality players, the essential factors in their success were professionalism and teamwork. Among their best players were England wicket-keeper George Duckworth; batsmen Ernest Tyldesley, Charlie Hallows, Harry Makepeace and Eddie Paynter; and bowlers Ted McDonald, Cec Parkin and Dick Tyldesley.\nLeicestershire.\nLeicestershire struggled financially through the inter-war years and their team, never in contention, was invariably in the lower half of the table. They took the wooden spoon in 1933 and 1939. One consequence of their perennially straitened circumstances – both in terms of money and the ability to attract new players – was that they became in 1935 the first county club in the 20th century to appoint a professional as their captain: Ewart Astill led them to sixth place in the County Championship with 11 victories and \"Wisden\" hailed it as \"the most successful season in the history of the club\". But the team reverted to type over the following seasons under the captaincy of the New Zealand \"amateur\" Stewie Dempster who was contracted to Sir Julien Cahn.\nAmong their better players were the wicket-keepers Tom Sidwell and Percy Corrall; batsmen Norman Armstrong, Les Berry and Eddie Dawson; and bowlers Ewart Astill, George Geary and Haydon Smith.\nMiddlesex.\nAfter a disappointing 1919 campaign, Middlesex improved dramatically to win back-to-back titles in 1920 and 1921. The team had its ups and downs for the next decade or so but became a strong unit again in 1935 when they finished third. They finished the thirties with four successive runners-up seasons from 1936 to 1939.\nMiddlesex's captain in the twenties was Frank Mann who also led England on their 1922–23 tour of South Africa. The most outstanding players in the two title-winning seasons were England batsman Patsy Hendren and all-rounder J. W. Hearne. Others in that team were wicket-keeper Joe Murrell; fast bowler Jack Durston; and all-rounders Nigel Haig, Harry Lee and Greville Stevens. Walter Robins was the team captain in the thirties and both Jim Smith and Jim Sims were England bowlers at the time. In the last few seasons before the Second World War, Middlesex could call upon Denis Compton, Bill Edrich and Jack Robertson.\nNorthamptonshire.\nNot a period that Northants want to remember as they were always in the bottom six and took the wooden spoon several times. Fred Bakewell, Vallance Jupp, Benjamin Bellamy and Nobby Clark were the better players in county cricket's least successful team.\nNottinghamshire.\nNottinghamshire (Notts) had the formidable pace attack of Harold Larwood and Bill Voce for several seasons. Until they fell away somewhat in the late thirties, Notts were one of the most competitive teams and usually in contention. They won the title in 1929 and were runners-up in three other seasons. Noted batsmen were George Gunn, \"Dodge\" Whysall, Arthur Carr, Joe Hardstaff Jr, Charles Harris, Walter Keeton, Wilfred Payton and Willis Walker. Besides Larwood and Voce, Notts had good bowlers in Fred Barratt, Tom Richmond and Sam Staples. Ben Lilley succeeded Thomas Oates as wicket-keeper in 1924 and held the post until he retired in 1937 and was succeeded by Arthur Wheat.\nSomerset.\nSomerset were never competitive and were always somewhere between mid-table and bottom six. Noted batsmen were Harold Gimblett, Frank Lee and Jack MacBryan. Their best bowlers were Jack White, who played in fifteen Tests for England, Bill Andrews and Arthur Wellard. Wally Luckes was the team's wicket-keeper through most of the inter-war years.\nSurrey.\nSurrey had a strong team in the 1920s but then fell away, after Jack Hobbs retired, to be a mid-table one through most of the 1930s. Besides Hobbs (known as \"The Master\"), noted batsmen were Andy Ducat, Andy Sandham, Tom Barling, Errol Holmes, Laurie Fishlock, Bob Gregory, Tom Shepherd and Stan Squires. Surrey's best bowlers were Bill Hitch, Alf Gover and Percy Fender. They could also call upon Maurice Allom, Alan Peach, Tom Rushby and Eddie Watts. Behind the stumps, Surrey were well served by Herbert Strudwick and Ted Brooks.\nSussex.\nHaving been a mid-table team through most of the 1920s, Sussex showed a marked improvement in 1928 to finish a good sixth and then a strong fifth in 1929. They slipped a little in 1930 but then came good and were fourth, second, second and second from 1931 to 1934. They were very close to their first official title in both the latter two seasons when one more win might have swung the balance. Sussex fell away in 1935 and were in mid-table from then to 1939. Noted batsmen were Ted Bowley, Tom Cook, Duleepsinhji, and the two pairs of brothers James and John Langridge, Harry and Jim Parks Sr. Sussex had the future South African Test captain Alan Melville in their team during the mid-1930s. Sussex had one of the all-time great bowlers in Maurice Tate. Vallance Jupp played for them in the early 1920s and other good or useful bowlers were Bowley, Jim Cornford, George Cox Jr, James Langridge, Jim Parks and Albert Wensley. Sussex keeper George Street was killed in a road accident at the beginning of the 1924 season and Tich Cornford succeeded him.\nWarwickshire.\nWarwickshire were bottom of the table in 1919 and, apart from a few seasons after 1930 when they reached the top ten (including a creditable fourth in 1934), were always in the bottom half. Warwickshire's best player was the England batsman Bob Wyatt. Other noted batsmen were Leonard Bates, Tom Dollery, Norman Kilner and Jack Parsons. Harry Howell was their best bowler in the 1920s. In the 1930s, Warwickshire had Joseph Mayer, George Paine and the young Eric Hollies. The wicket-keeper in the 1920s was Tiger Smith, who had made his debut in 1904; he was followed by Jack Smart and John Buckingham.\nWorcestershire.\nWorcestershire chose not to compete in the chaotic 1919 season. Like Northants, they were perennial strugglers and picked up five wooden spoons. There was an improvement in 1939 when they won more than they lost for once and finished seventh. Their best batsmen were Harold Gibbons, Maurice Nichol and Cyril Walters. The Nawab of Pataudi was on their books in the 1930s but he only played one full season for them, 1933, when he scored 1,749 runs. Fred Root was the mainstay of the Worcestershire bowling through the 1920s when they also had the all-rounder Frederick Pearson. In the 1930s, Worcestershire's best bowlers were George Brook, Dick Howorth, Peter Jackson, Reg Perks and Sidney Martin. Syd Buller, later well known as a Test umpire, kept wicket for Worcestershire in the 1930s.\nYorkshire.\nDespite the presence in their team of some of cricket's greatest names, Yorkshire's professionalism and teamwork were the key ingredients in their remarkable run of success through the whole inter-war period. They won the title twelve times and their lowest placing was fifth. Captaincy was a factor and the issue of a professional captain arose in 1927. Before then, it was widely believed that, despite there being a nominal amateur captain, the arch-professional Wilfred Rhodes was the \"de facto\" captain aided by his lieutenant, the even archer-professional Emmott Robinson. The matter was never in doubt from 1933 when Brian Sellers was appointed; Yorkshire won six titles under his tenure and only Lord Hawke has been more successful.\nYorkshire were strong in all departments. The mainstay of the team was their world-class opening batsman Herbert Sutcliffe, whose career spanned the whole inter-war period. He had two significant opening partners in Percy Holmes and the young Len Hutton. Maurice Leyland was another regular England batsman and Yorkshire could also rely on Wilf Barber, Arthur Mitchell and Edgar Oldroyd. Opposing batsmen always knew that they would face a formidable attack, not least the two all-time greats Wilfred Rhodes through the 1920s and his successor Hedley Verity in the thirties. Yorkshire also called upon England bowlers George Macaulay, Roy Kilner, Abe Waddington, Bill Bowes and Frank Smailes. The redoubtable Emmott Robinson was a good bowler too, as was his namesake Ellis Robinson (no relation) in the late 1930s. Yorkshire's main wicket-keepers were Arthur Dolphin, who had made his debut in 1905, and Arthur Wood; they both played for England.\nIndividual achievements.\nTeams in the 1920s and 1930s played more first-class matches than in most other decades and so there was opportunity for top-class players to amass large totals of runs, wickets and dismissals. Any half-decent county player who was active throughout a season would reasonably be expected to score 1,000 runs in the season (if a recognised batsman), take 100 wickets (if a regular bowler) or dismiss 50 batsmen (if a wicket-keeper).\nScoring 3,000 runs in a season was considered a remarkable achievement and it was done fifteen times with another 42 instances of players scoring 2,500 runs. The highest season aggregate was 3,352 by Frank Woolley in 1928. Herbert Sutcliffe and Wally Hammond scored 3,000 three times; Patsy Hendren and Phil Mead twice; and it was done once each by Woolley, Les Ames, Jack Hobbs, Ernest Tyldesley and Jim Parks senior. Twenty triple-centuries were scored, the highest being 364 by Len Hutton in the final Test against Australia in 1938. The most was three by Hammond. Don Bradman, who played in three English seasons from 1930 to 1938, scored two, both in Test matches.\nIn a similar vein, taking 250 wickets in a season was also considered a remarkable achievement and this was done six times, all between 1928 and 1932 and all by the same player, Tich Freeman. His highest tally was 304 in 1928. Tom Goddard took 248 wickets in 1937 and the next highest was 228 by Maurice Tate in 1925. There were thirty instances in all of bowlers taking 200 wickets in a season. Freeman accounted for eight of these and Charlie Parker five. Goddard, Tate and Hedley Verity did it three times. The other eight instances were by Alf Gover (twice), Cec Parkin (twice), Alec Kennedy, Fred Root, Ted McDonald and George Macaulay. Ten wickets in an innings was achieved 22 times, including the world record analysis of ten for 10 by Verity in 1932. The next best returns were ten for 18 by George Geary in 1929 and ten for 36 by Verity, again, in 1931. Freeman took three tens, one in each season from 1929 to 1931. Verity was the only other bowler to do it twice. Two Australian tourists, Arthur Mailey in 1921 and Clarrie Grimmett in 1930, are among the other seventeen.\nThere were 45 instances of 75 dismissals in a season. 44 of these were by wicket-keepers, as would be expected, and one by a fielder. In 1928, Wally Hammond played in 35 matches and took 79 catches, all as a fielder. In the same season, Les Ames (122) and George Duckworth (107) both achieved the rare milestone of 100 dismissals in a season. Ames did even better in 1929, completing 128 dismissals, and in 1932 he completed 104. Ted Brooks achieved 75 dismissals six times. He was followed by Ames, Duckworth and Fred Price (five each); Harry Elliott and Arthur Wood (four each); Tich Cornford and Ben Lilley (three each); George Street (twice) and seven others at one apiece.\nImpact of the Second World War.\nThe three-Test series in 1939 between England and the West Indies was completed on Tuesday, 22 August. This was the day before the signing of the Nazi-Soviet Pact, in reaction to which Great Britain formalised the Anglo-Polish military alliance on Friday, 25 August. The West Indians were due to play Sussex at Hove, starting on Saturday, 26 August. Another five matches, including one against Kent at the St Lawrence Ground, were planned until the tour was due to end on Tuesday, 12 September. In view of the international crisis, the West Indians decided to cancel the six remaining matches and sail for home. England did not play Test cricket again until they hosted India at Lord's in June 1946.\nThe 1939 County Championship was effectively over when the Second World War began. Six matches had started on Wednesday, 30 August and were still being played on Friday, 1 September, the day that Germany attacked Poland. One of them was Sussex v Yorkshire at Hove. This finished on the Friday morning, Yorkshire winning by nine wickets. That confirmed Yorkshire as county champions for the third successive season. The last three matches in the championship programme, scheduled to commence on Saturday, 2 September, were cancelled. The County Championship resumed in May 1946 and was again won by Yorkshire who thus held the title for ten years.\nThe 1939 Scarborough Festival, featuring three matches at North Marine Road, was cancelled. Yorkshire were due to play MCC on Saturday, 2 September. MCC had selected a team under the captaincy of Bob Wyatt. Gentlemen v Players was also planned to start on Wednesday, 6 September, and H. D. G. Leveson Gower's XI against the already departed West Indians on Saturday, 9 September. That was meant to be the season finale, ending on Tuesday, 12 September however no matches took place."

        "title": "European Professional Basketball League",
        "text": "The European Professional Basketball League (EPBL) was a professional basketball league held in Europe in 1975. Despite being played in five European countries (Belgium, Israel, Spain, Switzerland and West Germany) it was for the most part owned and operated by American investors with virtually no European players taking part. Opposed by most European basketball authorities such as FIBA, it generated little popular support and ended its first and only season prematurely in April 1975.\nTeams.\nBelgium Lions.\nThe Lions, who finished second in the league, were based in Brussels (with the Salle Simonet in Anderlecht as home arena), but also played games in Antwerp and Liège. They drew 1,870 and 2,101 spectators for their first two league games but that number was closer to 400 by the end of the league.\nThe club's owner was businessman Roy Brown from Skokie, Illinois, Les Patrick served as general manager. \nFormer UCLA star John Vallely served as player-coach of a team which also had Joe Ellis, Eddie Mast, Hank Siemiontkowski and one Belgian, Willy Steveniers.\nIberia Superstars.\nThe Superstars, who finished last in the league, were based in Barcelona (using the Palau Blaugrana as their home arena) but also played games in Badalona, Mataró and L'Hospitalet.\nOriginally created as two separate teams, namely the Catalan Estels (representing Barcelona) and Madrid Superstars, the teams were merged into one in November 1974 to guarantee an even number (at the time) of teams in the league. The teams would have played separately again from the second season onwards.\nThe co-owners were Houston businessman Allen Becker, and Spanish journalist Carlos Pardo, their general manager was Chuck Rohe.\nPlaying in green and blue, their coach was Del Harris and players included Roy Ebron, Pete Cross and Jeff Halliburton\nThe team had an uneasy relationship with the Spanish Basketball Federation who heavily restricted them in the venues and dates of their games. They were effectively banned from Madrid as Raimundo Saporta, both a FIBA and Real Madrid official, didn't want them to compete with his club.\nIsrael Sabras.\nThe Sabras, named so after the nickname given to native Israelis (despite the fact that no players were Israeli or even Jewish), played in the Yad Eliyahu Arena in Tel Aviv. \nThe best supported team in the league and eventual league winners, they attracted 70,000 fans over 21 home games, including 5,000 fans for a friendly with the Israel national basketball team.\nThis was achieved thanks to constant promotional efforts (for which they were said to have spent between $45,000 and $50,000), with English adverts taken in the press to attract American immigrants, colour ads posted throughout Tel Aviv and radio spots. The team was even able to secure the sponsorship of Tempo, Israel's largest soft drink manufacturer, one month into the competition.\nThe team was owned by businessmen Robert Hecht (regional vice-president of the United States Committee Sports for Israel) and J. Livingston Kosberg, while former National Basketball Association (NBA) public relations director Haskell Cohen served as its general manager.\nIts coach Herb Brown had players such as league MVP M.L. Carr, Roger Brown, Mike Macaluso, Lon Kruger and Henry Dickerson in his team.\nMunich Eagles.\nThe Eagles, who finished fourth, were based in Munich (using the McGraw Kaserne gym as home court). They were effectively a touring team as they also played in Augsburg, Berlin, Böblingen, Essen, Leverkusen, Sankt Ilgen, Rüsselsheim and even Cuxhaven in the northern point of the country. They struggled to attract fans (with an average of only 400), with highs of 1,500 in Berlin outdone by lows of 150 in Essen.\nHoward Fine of Baltimore was team owner, former Dallas Chaparrals assistant general manager Lee Meade served as GM.\nThe Eagles were coached by Larry Jones who also played for them, they boasted league top scorer Joe Hamilton and 7-foot-4 center Bob Rosier. Kirkland Rice served as the junior team assistant.\nSwiss Alpines.\nThe Alpines, who finished third, were based in Geneva but also played games in Lausanne, Martigny and Neuchâtel.\nBanker A.J. Smith and rice farmer B.C. Kirkland from Oak Grove, Louisiana were the team owners.\nDean Kirkpatrick, formerly a director of sports development at the University of Houston was general manager while former Nicholls State coach Jack Holley coached the team.\nShaler Halimon starred for the team with 20 points a game, also in the team were George Reynolds and Dennis Van Zant.\nFormat.\nEach team would play the others ten times (five at home and five away) for a total of forty games per team.\nLeague play would have ended by 30 May and playoffs were then to be held in June though no details were given as to how teams would qualify. Teams would then have played exhibition games in July.\nRules.\nThe EPBL followed the same rules as the American Basketball Association (ABA) and effectively copied its rule book word for word, it even employed former ABA referees such as Ken Sussman.\nIt was played in four-quarters of 12 minutes each, used a 30-second shot clock and notably included the ABA's three-point field goal.\nPlayers were sent off after 6 personal fouls, however players could be allowed to stay on court if they conceded extra free throws to the opposing team for each foul from that point onwards. \nThere were also white cards given to players, who then had to leave the court for two minutes.\nOne of the main differences was practical, the key wasn't rectangular but trapezoidal as that was the standard used in every European court.\nPlayer registration.\nFIBA imposed stringent restrictions on the players EPBL clubs were able to sign, the most restrictive being the minimum age limit of 30 for European players (or alternatively players needed to have stopped playing for five years) which meant that only one of the sixty players was European, 36-year-old former Belgian international Willy Steveniers.\nIn addition any European player over the age of 30 could be retained by national federations if they planned to use him as part of their national team. EPBL clubs were also forbidden from signing any American player contracted to an amateur European side.\nAny player who participated in the league would be banned for life from participating in amateur basketball thereafter, this was the case for Steveniers right after he played his first game.\nHistory.\nFirst attempt: EBA.\nThe concept of an entirely professional basketball league based in Europe was first promoted by Guy Van Den Broeck, coach of the Belgium national basketball team in February 1974. Van Den Broeck was said to be the European representative of ABA commissioner Mike Storen, who had reportedly mandated him to study the possibility of starting a professional competition throughout Europe. He took part in a meeting on 3 February with French club officials such as Guy Papineau (president of ASPO Tours) or René Fiolet (president of Caen BC) to gauge interest in the project. The meeting was productive and a league structure was announced soon after, with a calendar ranging from the following October to April involving eight teams based in major European cities (five franchises in France, Belgium and Israel were said to be ready).\nBecause of the limited number of teams and to follow the American model, teams would play each other repeatedly to guarantee an important number of home games (and ticket sales). A relationship with the ABA would also allow games against touring ABA teams and it was even suggested the league become a division of the American league with eventual intercontinental play. Though French Basketball Federation president Robert Busnel at first declared that the league was not of their concern, the Federation warned that any player signing a pro contract would be banned for life and that it would oppose the rental of municipal arenas to the pros. Van Den Broeck replied in a confrontational tone that he was unfazed by \"professional amateurs\" who were \"afraid they're going to lose the good life when the real pros arrive\".\nShortly after, however, the Belgium coach was threatened with a lifetime ban by the Belgian Basketball Federation, following which he ceased his involvement in the project.\nThe project was immediately taken over by Marcel Leclerc, president of football club Olympique de Marseille, who had been present at the earlier meeting. A communique from the organisation was released on 8 March 1974, naming the league the European Basketball Association (EBA) and formally announcing its creation had occurred in Paris a day earlier. Though it nominated French jurist Bernard Ulrich as its manager, the other members of the EBA remained anonymous. The league was said to consist of eight teams in two groups, with four cities already confirmed (though not disclosed) and four to be announced. International Basketball Federation (FIBA) secretary general William Jones openly doubted the project (along with national federations) stating it could not work due as there were too few arenas with a capacity over 10,000 to make it profitable. Leclerc was more confident, stating it would be successful thanks to high level of American players that would compose it. He was set to meet with American officials in early May to get support for his project. However, no further announcements were made and the league never materialised.\nFIBA opposition to the IBA.\nIn late April 1974 a syndicate of American businessmen led by the France-based John Coburn announced the creation of the International Basketball Association (IBA) in Paris.\nThough the league also aimed to create a professional basketball competition in Europe, it adamantly stressed it had no relation whatsoever with the EBA.\nIt had already reportedly sold eight franchises in seven countries (France, Spain, West Germany, Holland, Belgium, Italy and Switzerland) and planned to add up to four more to form two divisions of four to six teams each. \nA draft of American players not contracted to the NBA or ABA was planned for September, with league play set for November.\nThough the IBA announced Al McGuire as manager of one of the franchises, the Marquette coach publicly stated he had no intention of coaching in Europe.\nCoburn, who had just sold his stake in the World Hockey Association's New England Whalers, later fleshed out the composition of the league which would contain teams in Barcelona, Madrid, Brussels, Geneva, The Hague, Munich, Rome and a team shared between Lyon and Grenoble.\nThe league was to have American-European ownership though in effect most of the investors (such as the Development Company of Monroe, Louisiana for the Geneva franchise) would be American.\nEach franchise cost $60,000 and Coburn warned investors they should be prepared to lose money for the first two years.\nSome observers like The New York Times' Bernard Kirsch noted the IBA's connection to the unstable WHA and World Football League through Coburn and Munich manager Lee Meade (formerly associated with the ABA, WHA and World TeamTennis), expressing pessimism over the league's stability and its ability to attract European fans. \nTeams would be composed of 10 players each, with typical salaries of between $15,000 and $20,000 per player.\nDue to these wages (said to be around $200,000 per team) and operational costs (less than in the U.S. thanks to shorter travel times) it was calculated that each team would have to make a turnover of around $500,000 to make it worthwhile. Most of this was to come from ticket sales of the 62 games planned per team, with an average of 6,000 spectators per game hoped for.\nThough the IBA had announced its league was sanctioned by international basketball authorities, FIBA publicly denied sanctioning the league in any way.\nIn fact, William Jones sent a letter in August to national federations expressing his resolute opposition to any professional league in Europe, threatening to expel any player, referee or official who helped it in any way. He also threatened to ban professional teams from any arena used by amateur teams.\nDespite this, Jones selected Raimundo Saporta and Borislav Stanković to serve as FIBA representatives in talks with the IBA to take place on 3 September in Geneva.\nThis meeting and another on 4 October in Rome proved inconclusive and relations between the two parties seemed strained beyond repair.\nHowever, the IBA owners resented Coburn's stance in these negotiations and, after he threatened to scrap the project, contacted FIBA directly to negotiate. They offered to let FIBA have complete oversight of the league and impose its conditions. Coburn was hence removed from the project and the IBA name left with him.\nLeague creation: EPBL.\nThe league was officially named the European Professional Basketball League (EPBL), with its headquarters in Munich, San Diego State coach Dick Davis had resigned to serve as its commissioner.\nThe International Federation would regulate the league conjointly with national federations, deciding how players would be able to make the irreversible transition to becoming professionals. One of the first concessions was to limit the number of games to 40 (down from 62).\nA compromise was reached on 18 November between national federations, domestic clubs and professional clubs which broadly followed the requests FIBA had made:\nEach professional team was dependent on its respective federation as to where and when it played. Overall, teams were restricted to 25 games overall in their country (5 of which had to be friendly games).\nAdditionally they were only allowed to play on Friday's and Monday's to avoid clashing with domestic matches, unless granted exemptions from their federations.\nA way to get an exemption to play on a weekend would be to partner with a local team, for example FC Barcelona for the Iberia Superstars, wherein the professionals would cede 40% of ticket sales to the amateur side.\nIt held its player draft on 19 November 1974 in the New York Biltmore Hotel as 166 players were shared between the ten teams.\nGene Moore was the first pick (by Barcelona), followed by Shaler Halimon (Switzerland). Other familiar players (mostly from their college days) were John Vallely, Joe Ellis (both Belgium), Luther Rackley, Bill Chamberlain (both Lyon-Grenoble) and Wendell Hudson (London).\nDick Davis stressed that none of the league's players would be taken directly from NBA or ABA teams to avoid a salary war with the more established leagues.\nEffectively the top EPBL players would earn at most $25,000 a year whereas U.S.-based players could earn around $90,000.\nThis meant that the players drafted were described as \"marginal pros from the two major leagues\". Halimon, the first player drafted to say he would sign a contract, had averaged 6.3 points a game throughout his five-year NBA and ABA career for example.\nSome of the players such as Eddie Mast or Bob Rosier had trialled with teams in France and Italy but had not been retained.\nIt was also clarified that all of the league's players would be American for the first season, with European players to be added in following seasons once the league established itself.\nThe franchises were announced at the same time, with the eight teams participating in the draft being the Tel Aviv Sabras, London BICs, Swiss Alpines, Belgium Lions, Madrid Superstars and unnamed teams from Barcelona, Lyon‐Grenoble and Munich.\nFive teams announced their coaches, respectively Belgium (John Vallely), Tel Aviv (Herb Brown), Munich (former 76er Larry Jones who would also play), Switzerland (Jack Holley) and Madrid (Beryl Shipley, infamous for his recruiting violations at Southwestern Louisiana).\nThe London team had to pull out of the league shortly after as construction delays meant their arena would not be ready until May 1975.\nTo bring the number of teams to an even number it was then decided that the team from Barcelona, the Catalan Estels, and the Madrid Superstars would be merged for the first season before playing separately the following season. Their respective owners - Sid Franklin and Carlos Pardo for Barcelona, Alan Becker and Enrique Godoy for Madrid - met and agreed to base the team in Barcelona but also play games in Madrid and elsewhere in Spain.\nFaced with an unwelcoming attitude by French basketball authorities (especially Pierre Mazeaud, sports state secretary) and the country's taxation system, the investors from the Lyon-Grenoble also pulled out of the league., leaving five teams in the competition which would start on 17 January, namely the Superstars, Belgium Lions, Israel Sabras, Munich Eagles and Swiss Alpines.\nLeague play (1975).\nThe opening game took place in Munich's Olympic basketball stadium on 17 January 1975, William Jones conducted the tip-off. \nThe home team defeated the Israel Sabras 96-91 before the second game of the double-header saw the Belgium Lions defeat the Swiss Alpines 111–93.\nDespite some interest from locally based US Army servicemen and the presence of an American TV crew, the turnout proved a disappointment for the organisers as only around 400 to 500 spectators were scattered round a 6,000-seat arena.\nThe Belgians played their first home game on 20 January in Brussels, beating the Sabras 118–117. The Lions were also victorious two days later in Liege, beating the Iberia Superstars 105–99 in the Spaniards' debut.\nThe Swiss played their first home game (in Neuchâtel) on 25 January, losing 105-113 to the Superstars.\nThe Superstars only played their first game in Spain on 3 February (in Mataró) after long negotiations with the Spanish federation, they lost 106-107 to the Eagles.\nThe league organised a mini-tournament during the Geneva Motor Show in March 1975. Held in the Patinoire des Vernets it pitted the four best teams in the league (the Lions, Sabras, Eagles and hosts Alpines). The Swiss beat the Eagles 110–91 in the final on 15 March, while the Lions took third place after downing the Sabras 118–97.\nThe Belgium Lions had raced into the league lead with early wins and at one point held a five win lead over other teams.\nAfter a slow start to the season in which the Sabras amassed a 2–7 record whilst playing on the road, the team won eight games in a row to climb up the league table. \nThe two teams met in Israel in late March for a three-game series that would determine the league leader. The home side won three games in a row to replace the Lions at first place. They came back from a 24-point deficit with 12 minutes to go in one of the games, before themselves squandering a 30 points lead in the final game, though they still won 118–104.\nOn 27 March 1975 it was announced that the league schedule would be cut by ten games and that playoffs would be played between the best ranked sides (namely the Sabras, Lions and Alpines) in a double knock-out format (with Israel receiving a bye) on 3 April in Tel Aviv.\nThe league ended a few days later on the 31st however as both the Belgium and the Swiss teams refused to travel to Israel for the playoffs citing security concerns amidst the ongoing Arab–Israeli conflict. Officials from the Israeli team were incensed as the two had played league games there only a few weeks earlier. Team president (also EPBL president) Bob Hecht offered financial incentives for the teams to complete the playoffs to no avail. It was assumed that the main reasons for this withdrawal were financial as those teams were taking heavy losses and wanted to avoid the costs of travelling and paying players. As the best-ranked team in the league with a 20–10 record, Israel Sabras were crowned league winners that same day.\nThe Lions finished second with a 17–10 record, the Alpines third (15-13), Eagles fourth (10-18) and Super Stars last (7-18). Joe Hamilton (Munich) was league top-scorer with 24 points per game, followed by teammate Larry Jones with 23. Roger Brown (Israel) led the rebounding charts with 14 per game ahead of Eddie Mast (Belgium) with 11. Jones and Hamilton traded places in the assists ranking as the former led with 7 per game compared to 4 for the latter. M.L. Carr (Israel) was named the league MVP.\nAftermath.\nAfter the season ended, Munich played and won a friendly against German Basketball Cup winner SSV Hagen. The income from that game was seized by the German Basketball Federation as the club reportedly hadn't paid all the fees owed for playing in the country. This was seemingly to be the last game of the poorly-supported Eagles. Meanwhile, the Belgium Lions had refused to pay any of the $1,000 per game fees to the Belgian Federation and would likely be barred from playing in the country again. Iberia Superstars officials criticised the Spanish federation and accused it of not having respected the deal agreed between them (the team had been prevented from playing in Madrid thanks to Saporta's influence). They challenged amateur clubs Real Madrid and FC Barcelona (who did not answer) and stated their intention to return the following season.\nThe Sabras played a friendly against the Israel national basketball team, winning by 21 points. Haskell, the team's manager was confident of returning the next season.\nJack Holley and Shaler Halimon of the Alpines organised summer camps for local youths in Geneva through June and July.\nAt the time of the last regular season game it was announced that the league would return for a second season on 15 November 1975, with a possible eight teams taking part.\nLeague president (and Sabras co-owner) Bob Hecht stated in March 1975 that league operatives hadn't expected to make an operating profit the first year and there had \"been no disappointments\".\nAt a meeting in Antwerp on 9 April between Hecht and Davis and FIBA representatives such as Saporta and Busnel it emerged that the EPBL had lost 2,5 million dollars during the season (though part of this sum could be deducted from American taxes). Despite this, league representatives were confident a second season would take place. FIBA stressed that the same conditions would apply and that the EPBL would be collectively responsible for any of its clubs' failure to follow these conditions (such as the Lions not paying the Belgium federation).\nJess Smith, co-owner of the Swiss Alpines, declared in June that a league meeting would be held in Houston and that the league was looking to add franchises, possibly in England, Italy, Ireland, Yugoslavia or France.\nEchoing Hecht's statement that they expected a loss for the first year, he said team owners saw a future second season as \"a break-even year\".\nDespite these statements, a second EPBL season never happened and the league silently disappeared.\nReception.\nThe level of play was said to be relatively good, with an emphasis on creativity and dynamism that clashed with the more formulaic and methodical style usually seen in Europe. Another difference was the increased physicality and frequent fouls the rules allowed, with Holley describing \"extremely rough play\".\nJean-Jacques Maleval from France's L'Équipe was impressed by the spectacular shots made despite aggressive defending, noting the rhythm would be hard to follow for European teams.\nHe also highlighted the quality of the guards' playmaking and ball-handling, conversely noting the centers were less dominant (European amateurs teams tended to exclusively recruit tall forwards as foreign players).\nOther observers noted the contrast between talented players such as Vallely or Jeff Halliburton and their more anonymous teammates.\nLeague president (and Sabras co-owner) Bob Hecht said that EPBL teams were not \"on a par with the top teams in the NBA and ABA\" but could rival \"the worst teams in those leagues\".\nObserver's such as Pierre Tessier from L'Équipe Basket Magazine pondered whether the European public would be willing to watch a limited number of teams play each other repeatedly (as in the ABA and NBA) within a short period of time.\nIsrael Sabras manager Haskell Cohen lamented that the late start of the season and the cohabitation between amateur and professional clubs meant his club had to play nine home games over ten days, something not even New York crowds could countenance.\nA similar drawback was the difficult task of creating a fan base from the ground up without any local players or American players known to the European public.\nIn effect most teams struggled to attract crowds as team owners were surprised by the lack of popular support (as averages of at least 1,500 were needed to break even). Belgium Lions trainer Tom Shackelford claimed his team started with about 1,800 spectators which \"dwindled down to 300 and 400\". The Munich Eagles were also said to draw 400, the Swiss Alpines drew slightly more with around 800 per game.\nGames were often organised as double-headers with another game played prior to the EPBL one.\nFor example, in Switzerland, the Alpines' games were preceded by encounters between domestic league teams, with the amateur teams taking a percentage of ticket sales.\nThis led Swiss Le Temps journalist Jean-Pierre Gatoni to observe that only dedicated basketball fans would be prepared to go to these games weekly and these could be hard to find in countries like Switzerland.\nThis was compounded by the American style of entertainment offered which called for many play stoppages and on-court entertainment such as cheerleaders, which meant that games could last more than two hours, something the European public was unused to.\nThe league's logistics were also slightly haphazard, according to Swiss Alpines coach Jack Holley the team had to practice by \"running 300-yard wind sprints down the halls of a hotel in Munich\" before the league opener as training facilities weren't available yet. \nHolley also stressed the amount of travel the teams had to go through. For example, over two days, the Alpines took a 9-hour train ride from Geneva to Brussels, the next morning caught a 7-hour train to Cuxhaven, Germany, on the North Sea, the next day had a 27-hour train ride to Barcelona on the Mediterranean.\nWhat all observers agreed was that the league promoters had been completely ignorant of the European context and their arrogance meant they didn't cater the project to European consumers.\nFormer Munich Eagles manager Lee Meade called the league an \"ill-fated effort by some American entrepreneurs who thought because they had money they could shove pro basketball down the throats of Europeans.\"\nThis meant EPBL owners and managers made little effort to promote their league (with few ads placed in the media) as they assumed bringing professional American-style basketball would be enough to attract fans.\nConversely, the most successful team both on and off the court were the Israel Sabras who had a clear promotional strategy and invested heavily in advertising. Despite economic downturn in the country and competition from popular \"amateur\" clubs such as Maccabi Tel Aviv the Sabras managed to gain a loyal following, attracting over 3,000 fans per game, far more than the average of 400 for Israeli league games.\nDespite this the team predicted a loss of $260,000 for the season, as ticket prices were low (with many discounts for military personnel or children) and they had to pay their national federation for each home game, a situation shared by all EPBL teams.\nThe only winners in the league's demise were FIBA and its leader William Jones who had succeeded in delaying the advent of professionalism in Europe."

Before the second men's match was played, Ireland women played against Bangladesh women on the same day at the same venue. Prior to the series, Ireland played a tri-series against Netherlands and Scotland as preparation for these matches.\nIndia last visited Ireland , playing a One Day International (ODI) match, with India winning by nine wickets. The teams have only played one T20I match previously, in the group stage of the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 tournament, with India winning the fixture by eight wickets. The first of the two matches of the series was India's 100th T20I match.\nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced India's squad for the trip to Ireland on 8 May 2018, naming Virat Kohli as the captain. However, Kohli was initially signed by the English side Surrey County Cricket Club to play in the 2018 County Championship. Surrey's website stated that he would be playing for them throughout June, including their final fixture against Yorkshire, scheduled to be played from 25 to 28 June 2018. The BCCI were in discussions with Surrey to reach an amicable solution for both sides over the fixture clash. However, during the match in the 2018 Indian Premier League on 17 May, Kohli suffered an injury and his spell with Surrey was cancelled. The BCCI went on to state that they were confident that Kohli would be fit enough to play in the tours to Ireland and England.\nIndia won the series 2–0. India scored more than 200 runs in both matches, the first time they had done so in consecutive games. Their victory in the second match was their biggest winning margin, in terms of runs, in T20Is, and the joint-second biggest winning margin in T20Is by any team. Ireland were bowled out for 70 runs in 12.3 overs, which was the third-shortest innings in T20Is.\nSquads.\nJosh Little was ruled out of Ireland's squad due to injury.

This edition of the European Rowing Championships was for women only and was held from 12 to 14 August. Twelve countries contested five boat classes (W1x, W2x, W4x+, W4+, W8+). Men would compete later that month in Italy for the 1960 Summer Olympics.\nGerman participation.\nNeither FISA, the International Rowing Federation, nor the International Olympic Committee recognised East Germany as a country and insisted on one German team per boat class. The two German rowing associations first met at the in East Berlin in January 1960 and agreed that qualification races would be held for both the European Championships and the Olympic Games, with the details to be agreed on at a further meeting in March. Further negotiations in Hanover during April were difficult, with West German representatives rejecting suggestions by East German delegates. At further negotiations in Berlin in Mai, it was agreed that qualification races for the European Championships and the Olympic Games would be dealt with separately. In the end, the West German view of having a single regatta decide the representation prevailed, and Olympic qualifications were decided on 6 August on the Wedau Regatta Course in Duisburg. The qualifications for the European Championships were held at the same weekend, but it is not clear from media reporting whether this happened at the same venue. With East German women dominant in rowing, the West Germans contested the double scull boat class only, but that race was won by East Germany. Thus, all German representatives in London were from East Germany."

Women from 13 countries were represented with 34 boats, and they competed in five boat classes (W1x, W2x, W4x+, W4+, W8+) from 20 to 22 August. The men competed in all seven Olympic boat classes (M1x, M2x, M2-, M2+, M4-, M4+, M8+) a week later, from 26 to 29 August. It would be another 22 years until women would first be allowed to compete at Olympic level in 1976.\nMedal summary – women's events.\nFor the 1954 regatta, the Bosbaan was widened from five lanes to six. All of the boat classes had single-digit entries (five crews each for the eight and quad, and nine for the singles), just four of the lanes were used in the races so that there were heats, repêchages, and a final."

However, in the final, he fell to Juan Martín del Potro in a close three set match, despite having three match points on his own serve.\nMiami Open.\nFederer entered the Miami Open as the defending champion, knowing that he needed to reach the quarterfinals in order to preserve his world No. 1 ranking. However, after receiving a first round bye, he was upset by Australian qualifier Thanasi Kokkinakis in the second round. At world No. 175, Kokkinakis was the lowest ranked player to defeat a world No. 1 since Francisco Clavet defeated Lleyton Hewitt at the same tournament in 2003. With this loss, he lost the world No. 1 ranking back to Rafael Nadal.\nFederer then announced that he would skip the entire clay court season, including the French Open, for the second consecutive year. Despite this, he spent one more week as world No. 1 – the week of 14 May 2018 – as a result of Nadal's quarterfinal loss in the Madrid Open. Nadal went on to regain the ATP rankings' top position the following week, by winning the Italian Open.\nGrass court season.\nStuttgart Open.\nFederer returned to the ATP tour to play the Stuttgart Open, which marks the beginning of the grass court season. He entered having won his last 12 matches in a row and 30 sets in a row on grass. After a bye in the first round, he proceeded to defeat Mischa Zverev in three sets to advance to the quarterfinals, ending his streak of 30 consecutive sets won on grass. In the quarterfinals, he defeated Guido Pella in straight sets. He advanced to the final with a three-set victory over Nick Kyrgios, thereby reclaiming the ATP No. 1 ranking from Rafael Nadal in the following week, and defeated Milos Raonic in straight sets to win the Stuttgart Open for the first time and the 98th title of his career. This extended his grass court winning streak to 16.\nHalle Open.\nFederer advanced to the Halle Open, bidding for a tournament-record tenth title. He defeated Aljaž Bedene in straight sets in the first round, setting up a second round match against Benoît Paire which he won in a third set tiebreak after saving two match points. He defeated Matthew Ebden in the quarterfinals and qualifier Denis Kudla in the semifinals, both in straight sets, to reach the final. He faced Borna Ćorić in the final, but lost in three sets despite having a set point in the first set. This loss also meant that he dropped to world No. 2 after one week on top of the rankings. Nevertheless, the match saw an improvement in form from Federer, after a difficult run to the final. This ended a 20 match win streak on grass courts.\nWimbledon.\nFederer moved on to play the Wimbledon Championships, looking to defend his 2017 title. He was seeded first in a Grand Slam for the first time since the 2012 US Open. During his first-round match, Federer walked onto Centre Court wearing Uniqlo sportswear, officially ending his 20-year relationship with Nike and confirming the rumoured ten-year $300 million contract with the Japanese clothing company. He went on to defeat Dušan Lajović, Lukáš Lacko, Jan-Lennard Struff and Adrian Mannarino, all in straight sets, to reach the quarterfinals. In the quarterfinals, he surprisingly lost to Kevin Anderson in a long five-setter (lasting 4 hours and 14 minutes), with a result of 11–13 in the fifth set, despite having led by two sets to love and having held a match point in the third set, ending a streak of 34 sets won in a row at Wimbledon.\nNorth American hard court season.\nCincinnati Masters.\nOn July 23, Federer announced the withdrawal from his previously scheduled Canadian Open, citing his career longevity strategy. This way, he began the North American hard court season in the Cincinnati Masters. He started his campaign by defeating Peter Gojowczyk and Leonardo Mayer in straight sets, setting up a clash with countryman Stan Wawrinka in the quarterfinals. He defeated Wawrinka in three sets, advancing to the semifinals to face David Goffin. Federer won the first set and Goffin was forced to retire in the second set with a shoulder injury. This set up a final between Federer and Novak Djokovic, which Federer lost in straight sets, adding the 46th chapter to their storied rivalry approximately two and a half years after their last meeting.\nUS Open.\nFederer moved on to play the US Open, the season's last major, as the No. 2 seed. He did not drop a set in the opening three rounds, defeating Yoshihito Nishioka, Benoît Paire and Nick Kyrgios in the first three rounds. However, Federer proceeded to lose in the fourth round against John Millman in four sets, having missed set points in the second and third sets before losing a fourth-set tiebreak. He committed 77 unforced errors, including 10 double faults, and only hit 49% of first serves in what was widely regarded as one of the worst serving performances of his career. However, Federer assured the number of points needed to qualify for the ATP Finals for the sixteenth time in his career.\nAsian swing.\nShanghai Masters.\nFederer started the Asian swing by playing the Shanghai Masters, the eighth Masters 1000 tournament of the season. Due to the absence of his rival Rafael Nadal, the No. 1 player in the ATP rankings, he was the first seed. As a top-eight seed, he earned a first round bye. In the second round, he defeated Daniil Medvedev in three sets, advancing to the third round, where he defeated Roberto Bautista Agut – also in three sets. In the quarterfinals he encountered No. 8 seed Kei Nishikori, defeating him in straight sets and advancing to a semifinal clash with the No. 13 seed, Borna Ćorić. It was their third meeting of the season, with one victory for each in the previous two. Federer ended up losing to Ćorić in straight sets and dropped to No. 3 in the ATP rankings at the following week.\nEuropean indoor hard court season.\nSwiss Indoors.\nFederer then moved on to play his home tournament, the Swiss Indoors, in Basel, as the defending champion. In an interview, Federer shared that he had sustained a hand injury in training prior to the grass court season that had caused severe pain in his forearm. He stated that this injury significantly hindered his play, particularly his forehand, from the Stuttgart Open until the US Open. In the first two rounds of the tournament, Federer defeated Filip Krajinović and Jan-Lennard Struff, in three and two sets respectively, advancing to the quarterfinals. There, he defeated Gilles Simon in a tough three-set match, reaching his 200th career semifinal. Federer then bested Daniil Medvedev and Marius Copil in straight sets in the semifinal and final respectively, claiming a record-extending ninth Basel title and the 99th title of his career.\nParis Masters.\nAt the beginning of the season, Federer had not expected to play the Paris Masters – the last Masters 1000 tournament of the year. However, he was featured in the draw as the No. 3 seed and later confirmed his presence in the tournament. After getting a bye in the first round, he was supposed to face Milos Raonic in the second round. However, Raonic was forced to withdraw from the tournament due to an elbow injury. Federer then advanced to the third round, where he defeated No. 13 seed Fabio Fognini in straight sets to set a quarterfinal clash with Kei Nishikori. In the quarterfinals he defeated Nishikori, also in straight sets, to set a semifinal match with Novak Djokovic, who was on a 21-match winning streak. In their 47th encounter, Federer lost to the red-hot Serb in three very close sets, despite having a set point in the first set.\nATP Finals.\nHaving qualified for the ATP Finals, Federer was drawn in the group Lleyton Hewitt with Kevin Anderson, Dominic Thiem and Kei Nishikori. In his first match, he lost in straight sets to Nishikori for his ninth defeat of the season. He then defeated Thiem and Anderson, both in straight sets, to ultimately win the group and secure a semifinal place in the tournament. However, in his fifteenth tournament semifinal, Federer lost in straight sets to eventual champion Alexander Zverev to finish the season.\nAll matches.\nThis table chronicles all the matches of Roger Federer in 2018, including walkovers (W/O) which the ATP does not count as wins.\nYearly records.\nHead-to-head matchups.\nATP and Grand Slam sanctioned matches.\nRoger Federer has a ATP match win–loss record in the 2018 season.

The competition for men had been held the previous month in Copenhagen. The regatta in Khimki was held from 6 to 8 September. Five boat classes were contested (W1x, W2x, W4x+, W4+, W8+). Eleven countries nominated a total of 33 boats for the regatta, which was held over 1,000 metres. Five lanes were available and this meant that in three boat classes, there was only the final: W2x, W4+, and W8+.\nGerman participation.\nFISA did not recognise East Germany as a country and insisted on one German team per boat class. The selection trials were won by West Germany in the single sculls boat class (Karen Wolf), but the other four boat classes were won by East Germany. Wolf came fifth in the final in Khimki.\nMedal summary – women's events.\nOn the day of the finals, it rained heavily and there was a strong crosswind. Those rowers in the lane closest to the shore were least affected by the wind. The singles as the smallest boats are most affected, and the British medal favourite, Penny Chuter, hit the buoys twice and came fourth, and the previous European champion, Alena Postlová, capsized.\nMedals table.\nThe Soviet Union won all five gold medals. Other countries that competed in the finals but did not win medals were Great Britain, West Germany, the Netherlands, and Poland. Valentina Tereshkova, the first women who had travelled to space in June 1963, donated a crystal cup that was won by the Soviet team for being the most successful country."

The competition for men was held later in the month in Ghent. The women competed in five boat classes (W1x, W2x, W4x+, W4+, W8+).\nGerman participation.\nThe National Olympic Committee of the GDR was granted provisional membership in 1955 and as a next step, East Germany tried to gain membership of the individual sporting organisations that participated in Olympic disciplines. In July 1955, the East German rowing association applied for a license from FISA, the International Rowing Federation, to be able to nominate their rowers at the European Championships in Bucharest (women) and Ghent (men). FISA's response was that the next congress, to be held just prior to the championships in Ghent, will decide on the matter. Therefore, East German teams could not compete in 1955. At the congress, East Germany was unanimously accepted as a new member. The only West German competitor was Ingrid Scholz, who had won silver in single sculls in 1954; she came sixth in 1955."

He was named to the all-state team and played in the Shrine Bowl of the Carolinas. Hughes was ranked the No. 3 cornerback in North Carolina and committed to the University of North Carolina to play college football.\nCollege career.\nHughes played one year at North Carolina in 2015. In October 2015, he was suspended along with M. J. Stewart, and was charged with misdemeanor assault charges from an altercation that had occurred earlier that month. He left the team after the season and transferred to Garden City Community College, where he spent a year.\nIn 2017, Hughes transferred to the University of Central Florida (UCF) and participated in UCF's undefeated 2017 season which ended in UCF being named National Champions by the Colley Matrix poll. Hughes made headlines with his game-sealing 95-yard kickoff return in the November 24, 2017, War on I–4 game against the South Florida Bulls, with \"Orlando Sentinel\" writer Shannon Green remarking that the play saved the undefeated season for the Knights.\nHughes left UCF after one season, deciding to forgo his senior year and enter the 2018 NFL Draft.\nProfessional career.\nMinnesota Vikings.\nOn April 26, 2018, the Minnesota Vikings selected Hughes in the first round, 30th overall, of the 2018 NFL Draft.

He finished the season with 45 tackles, nine passes defensed, two forced fumbles, and an interception through 14 games and three starts.\nHughes entered the 2020 season as the Vikings' top starting cornerback alongside rookie starter Cameron Dantzler.

        "title": "Neil Hallett (rugby union)",
        "text": "Neil Hallett (born 1980) is a retired English rugby union player who played at either full-back, centre or fly-half Neil is a coach at Wimbledon. An excellent kicker, Hallett is best known for his time at Esher where he scored over 1,300 points for the club in all competitions, and he is also one of the most prolific scorers in tier 3 history (2nd all-time as of 2016-17) with over 1,400 league points scored from his time spent with at four different clubs including Esher and Ealing Trailfinders. As well as playing club rugby Hallett has also captained Surrey (winning three County Championship Shield titles) and been capped by the Barbarians and England Counties XV.\nCareer.\nClub career.\nAfter starting his career at Rosslyn Park, Hallett moved to fellow National 2 side, Bracknell, mid-way through the 2002-03 season in order to gain first team rugby. It was at Bracknell that he came to prominence, enjoying an outstanding 2003-04 season which saw him come 3rd top scorer in the division with 239 points helping his side to a very respectable 7th-place finish. Despite starting the 2004-05 season with Bracknell, after just 4 games Hallett decided to join divisional rivals, Esher. It proved to be the correct decision as by the end of the season Bracknell were relegated while Esher (just) managed to stay up, with Hallett's kicking contributing greatly to his new club's survival. The period between 2005-07 was Halletts best at Esher, finishing as the divisions top scorer twice (with 302 and 398 points respectively) and culminating in the Surrey club winning the league title and promotion at the end of the 2006-07 campaign. He helped the club survive several years in tier 2 but a change to the divisional structure at the end of the 2008-09 season involving the creation of the RFU Championship meant that Esher were relegated back to tier 3 despite finishing in 12th spot.\nIn the summer of 2010, despite having a bit-part role in Esher's promotion from National League 1 to the Championship, Hallett decided to leave the club to join Ealing Trailfinders, playing two divisions below in National League 2 South. Back enjoying first team rugby, Hallett was part of an excellent Trailfinders side that stormed to the title, contributing 337 points in a side that included the prolific Phil Chesters who scored a record-breaking 70 tries that year. He spent a further season at the club as they just missed out on a successive promotion to Jersey before deciding to join London regional side Wimbledon as a player-coach for the 2012-13 season, combining playing with teaching at Wimbledon College. He would play the final years of his career at Wimbledon, helping them to the London 1 South title in 2015 before retiring at the end of the 2016-17 season, having helped his promoted side to a mid-table finish in National League 3 London &amp; SE.\nRepresentative career.\nFollowing an excellent debut season with Esher, Hallett was selected for the Surrey squad taking part in the 2005 County Plate (now Shield) competition. He took his good form into the competition that summer, helping his county to qualify from the group stage which included a man-of-the-match performance in the 38-22 win against Dorset &amp; Wilts, scoring 28 points. After winning their semi-final fixture, Surrey faced Somerset in the Twickenham final. Having already beaten the south-west side in the group stages, Surrey once again proved too strong, Hallett contributing 9 points from the boot as he helped his side to their first taste of County Championship silverware since 1971.\nHis performances at club and county drew the interest of the Barbarians who included Hallett in their 2006 tour. He made his Barbarians debut in the last game of the tour, contributing a try and conversion and being named man-of-the-match as his side won 28-19 against the Georgian national team in Tbilisi in June. Further call-ups to the Barbarians would follow the next season, with appearances against the Combined Services, East Midlands and British Army to follow, although he would fail to score any further points for the Ba-Baas. In February 2007 he also made his England Counties XV debut, scoring 10 points in a 17-20 loss against an Irish Club XV at Donnybrook. A second Counties appearance followed in March, with Hallet contributing 21 points, including 2 tries, as England Counties beat France Amateurs 41-10 at the Rectory Field.\nTowards the end of his career playing at Wimbledon, Hallett was still very much involved with the Surrey County side. He was called up to take part in his counties 2013 County Championship Shield campaign (formerly known as the plate) and was made captain. Despite being in the twilight of his career, Hallet showed that class was permanent, contributing 61 points including 3 tries as Surrey stormed their way through to the final. At Twickenham Surrey managed to overcome a resolute Cumbria 21-16, with Hallett's 11 points, including 3 penalties, proving to be vital as his county won their second Shield title. The following season, Hallett would return to county action for the last team, captaining newly promoted in the 2014 County Championship Plate competition. Once again Hallet was outstanding as Surrey went on to win the Plate competition, contributing 73 points overall. He saved his strongest performance for the final with a massive 24 points including 6 penalties helping Surrey overcome Leicestershire 39-16.\nHonours and records.\nEsher\nEaling Trailfinders\nWimbledon\nBarbarians\nSurrey"

The game was played on April 8, 2019, at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota, between the Texas Tech Red Raiders and the Virginia Cavaliers. It was the first time since 1979 that both teams in the national championship game were making their first such appearance. The Cavaliers defeated the Red Raiders, 85–77 in overtime, to win their first national title. Kyle Guy was named the NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player.\nParticipants.\nTexas Tech Red Raiders.\nTexas Tech, led by third-year head coach Chris Beard, finished the regular season with a record of 26–5. They posted a 14–4 conference record, earning them the No. 2 seed in the Big 12 tournament, where they lost to No. 10 seed West Virginia in their first game. In the NCAA Tournament, the Red Raiders received a No. 3 seed in the West Regional. They defeated No. 14 seed Northern Kentucky and No. 6 seed Buffalo to reach the Sweet Sixteen, where they upset No. 2 seed Michigan by nineteen points. Two days later, they defeated No. 1 seed Gonzaga to win the West Regional. In their first Final Four, the Red Raiders overcame a challenge from the East Regional champions, No. 2 seed Michigan State, whom they defeated 61–51 to reach their first ever NCAA title game.\nJarrett Culver, a sophomore, was named the Big 12 Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year.\nVirginia Cavaliers.\nThe Cavaliers were coming off a year they had gone from an unranked team all the way to AP No. 1, only to become the first No. 1 seed to lose in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Led by tenth-year head coach Tony Bennett, Virginia finished the regular season with a record of 28–2. They posted a 16–2 conference record, earning them the No. 1 seed in the ACC tournament, where they defeated No. 8 seed NC State, before losing to No. 4 seed Florida State. In the NCAA Tournament, the Cavaliers earned a No. 1 seed in the South Regional. The Cavaliers defeated No. 16 seed and NCAA tournament debutants Gardner–Webb in the first round, and No. 9 seed Oklahoma in the second round to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, where they ended a potential Cinderella run from No. 12 seed Oregon. In the Elite Eight, the Cavs beat No. 3 Purdue in overtime; with the win, they advanced to their first Final Four since 1984. They then defeated No. 5 seed Auburn, champions of the Midwest Regional, by a single point.\nDe'Andre Hunter, a redshirt sophomore, was named NABC Defensive Player of the Year.\nGame summary.\nTexas Tech did not score its first field goal until 7:22 into the game. The Red Raiders took the lead, 25–24, with 3:57 left in the first half. Virginia's Ty Jerome hit a three-point field goal with less than two seconds left in the first half, to give Virginia a 32–29 lead over Texas Tech at halftime. Virginia kept the lead for much of the second half, but Texas Tech stayed in the game and took the lead, until De'Andre Hunter of Virginia hit a game-tying three point shot with 12 seconds left in regulation. Texas Tech's Jarrett Culver attempted a three-point shot to win the game, but the shot was blocked by Virginia's Braxton Key, and time expired. Texas Tech outscored Virginia 39–36 in the second half, resulting in a 68–68 tie at the end of regulation.\nThe game went into a five-minute overtime. Matt Mooney of Texas Tech opened overtime with two baskets, including a three-pointer, but Virginia then went on an 11–0 scoring run. Virginia ran out the clock to secure the win with a final score of 85–77.\nAfter the game, Virginia's Kyle Guy was chosen as the NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player. Hunter finished the game with a career-high 27 points. Culver, meanwhile, struggled during the game while primarily defended by Hunter (NABC Defensive Player of the Year) and scored 15 points while shooting 5-for-22 (.227), including 0-for-6 on three point shots."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in New Zealand in 1880–81",
        "text": "The Australian cricket team toured New Zealand in January and February 1881. The Australians played ten matches against provincial teams, nine of which fielded 22 players (the other team, Canterbury, fielded 15) with the aim of providing more evenly-matched contests. Two further brief matches were played to fill the allotted time after a scheduled match finished early. As none of the matches were 11-a-side they are not considered to have been first-class.\nThe team.\nOnly Murdoch, Blackham, Boyle and Spofforth had toured New Zealand with the Australians in 1877-78.\nGeorge Bonnor was unable to tour owing to a leg injury, and Alick Bannerman forwent the tour to be with his sick mother and sister in Sydney. Moule missed the early matches owing to a hand injury he incurred in Hobart on the way over.\nTobin played only four matches. White was a young player from the East Melbourne club who went on the tour as permanent twelfth man, but owing to injuries to the other players he ended up playing in eight matches. He batted last in all of them, never reached double figures, and did not bowl.\nThe matches.\nDespite arriving in Bluff from Australia on the morning of the match, the Australians were in good form. Spofforth (10 for 19) and Palmer (9 for 21) dispatched Southland in the first innings, and Boyle (11 for 45) and Alexander (7 for 25) in the second. Murdoch was the Australians' highest scorer with 40; no Southland player exceeded 15.\nAs with the 1877–78 match, the newspapers referred to the local team as Invercargill, not Southland.\nHugh MacNeil, who had made the highest score by either side with 28 when the Australians played Otago in 1877–78, repeated the feat this time with 44 in the second innings, and added 5 for 28 with the ball in the Australians' first innings. He received a trophy valued at ten guineas. Murdoch was the Australians' top scorer with 25 in the first innings. Spofforth and Palmer bowled unchanged, Spofforth taking 8 for 47 and 8 for 37, Palmer 12 for 33 and 11 for 39. The Australians scored slowly: just under one run per four-ball over.\nThe Australians' train from Dunedin was delayed on the morning of the match, and consequently play did not begin that day until a quarter to two. Groube was the highest scorer on either side with 30. Again Spofforth and Palmer did all the Australians' bowling, Spofforth taking 13 for 13 and 7 for 39, Palmer 7 for 28 and 11 for 35. Rain interrupted play on the second day, depriving the Australians of the chance of victory.\nThe Australians arrived by train from Oamaru in the morning, and play began at one o'clock. The first day was declared a half-holiday in Timaru. Boyle top-scored for the Australians with 48. Spofforth took 11 for 11 in the first innings, including the first four wickets before South Canterbury had scored; Boyle took 11 for 37 in the second.\nCanterbury had inflicted the only defeat on the 1877–78 Australians. This time, when Canterbury were dismissed for 90 in their first innings, Murdoch wagered he would beat their total on his own; he made 111. Five other Australian batsmen made between 31 and 48. Henry Secretan was Canterbury's top-scorer with 30 not out in the first innings, batting at number six. Spofforth (12 wickets) and Palmer (14) did all the Australian bowling, sending down 141.3 four-ball overs between them. A fill-in match was played afterwards, in which the Australians made 65 for 3 and the Canterbury XV did not bat.\nAgain Spofforth and Palmer did all the bowling, this time sending down 117 overs. Slight was the match's top-scorer with 40; James Blacklock was Wellington's best, with 26 in the second innings. The scoring was slow: 321 runs off 267 four-ball overs. A fill-in match was played afterwards, in which a Wellington XII made 18 all out and the Australians replied in the time available with 8 for 0.\nGales in Cook Strait delayed the Australians' arrival in Nelson, and the match did not start until two o'clock on the first day. Samuel Fowler, the Nelson opener, made 30 in the first innings; no one else on either side exceeded 16.\nBlackham was injured, and the Australians played with only ten men; they were allowed a substitute to make up 11 in the field. The pitch was hard and bumpy, and the Wanganui selectors had made sure they selected the district's best fieldsmen. With 22 of them on the field at once, \"their numbers and agility were too much for the Australians\".

Then Norwegian snowboarder Mons Røisland, who was considered a possible medal contender, broke a chest bone and tore ligaments in a crash during practice prior to the finals, which made him unable to compete.\nEleven months after the Canadian Mark McMorris ended up in a coma, he won the Olympic bronze medal.\nIn the victory ceremony, the medals were presented by Pierre-Olivier Beckers-Vieujant, member of the International Olympic Committee accompanied by Dexter Paine, FIS vice president.\nQualification.\nThe top 40 athletes in the Olympic quota allocation list qualified (for both big air and slopestyle, the rankings were combined). This meant only a maximum of 40 could qualify across both events. A maximum of four athletes per National Olympic Committee (NOC) was allowed. All athletes qualifying must also have placed in the top 30 of a FIS World Cup event or the FIS Freestyle Ski and Snowboarding World Championships 2017 during the qualification period (July 1, 2016 to January 21, 2018) and also have a minimum of 50 FIS points to compete.

It was the 59th World Cup. The format is 72-hole stroke play; the first and third days were four-ball (best ball), and the second and fourth days were foursomes (alternate shot) play.\nThe Belgian pair of Thomas Pieters and Thomas Detry won with a score of 265, 23-under-par. Australia and Mexico tied for second place, three strokes behind. It was Belgium's first victory in the World Cup. \nQualification.\nThe 28 nations to compete were determined based on the top-ranked player from each country from the Official World Golf Ranking as of 3 September 2018.\nThese 28 seeded players selected a partner from the same country ranked in the top 500 of the OWGR. If there were less than five possible choices in the top 500, the seeded player could choose any of the next five players from that country in the rankings, even if they were ranked outside the top 500. The deadline for teams to be finalized was 20 September.\nTeams.\nThe table below lists the teams in order of qualification (i.e. ranking of seeded player on 3 September 2018) together with their World Rankings at the time of the tournament.\nThe following players were eligible to be a seeded player but did not commit. The order is based on the World Rankings on 3 September 2018. Five countries with an eligible player did not compete: Argentina, Austria, Chinese Taipei, Chile and Paraguay (withdrew as alternate). They were replaced by Zimbabwe, Malaysia, Wales and Greece.\nFinal leaderboard.\nAustralia, England and South Korea tied for the lead after the first day fourball rounds with 10-under-par rounds of 62. Conditions were difficult for the second day foursomes with rain and gusty winds. Belgium and South Korea led after day 2 on 10-under-par. Mexico had the best round of the day, 70, to lift themselves into 7th place while hosts Australia had a disappointing round of 76 and dropped into a tie for 8th place. On the third day Belgium had their second fourball round of 63 and took a 5-stroke lead, ahead of Italy, Mexico and South Korea. On the final day Australia set the clubhouse lead on 268 after a final round 65. Belgium came to the last with a two-stroke lead. Thomas Pieters put their second shot to four feet, which Thomas Detry holed to give Belgium a three-stroke victory with a final round of 68. Mexico tied with Australia for second place.\nRounds 1 and 3 were four-ball (best ball), rounds 2 and 4 were foursomes (alternate shot). Prize money is for the pair."

        "text": "John Read is an English former professional snooker player. Read competed between 1991 and 2003, with his highest ranking being 62nd. His most notable tournament run was at the 1996 Malta Masters, where he was beaten in the final by Mark Davis.\nCareer.\nRead turned professional in 1991, making an immediate impact at the 1992 Asian Open; there, in only his fifth ranking tournament, he reached the quarter-finals, defeating seven players - including Fred Davis, John Virgo and Rex Williams - to qualify for the final stages in Bangkok before also eliminating Brian Morgan and David Roe. He could not progress any further, however, as Joe Swail whitewashed him 5–0 to reach the semi-finals.\nIn the following year's edition of the Asian Open, Read reached the last 32, where he lost 3–5 to Nick Fruin; his only other performance of note during the 1992–93 season came in qualifying for the World Championship, where he reached the last 48. Requiring only one more win to reach the Crucible Theatre for the first time, he lost 9–10 to Tony Jones, finishing the season ranked 78th.\nHaving came close to reaching his second ranking event quarter-final at the 1995 Welsh Open - where he lost 4–5 to Peter Ebdon in the last 16 - Read was one of the players invited to compete in the 1996 Malta Masters in May 1996. As part of a sixteen-man field, he defeated amateur Amnuayporn Chotipong 4–0, Gary Wilkinson 4–2 and Suriya Suwannasingh 5–3 to reach the first final of his professional career. He could not capture his first title, as Mark Davis beat him 6–3.\nThe result in Malta did not inspire better performances during 1996–97, but in the following season, Read reached his second career quarter-final, in the 1997 Grand Prix. Ranked 70th for the season, he beat Dean Reynolds 5–3 before eliminating three consecutive players who themselves were ranked in the top 32 - Rod Lawler 5–3, Ronnie O'Sullivan 5–2 and Tony Drago 5–3 - to set up a meeting with John Higgins. Higgins proved too strong a challenge for Read; he scored only 48 points in a 0–5 defeat.\nThanks to his efforts in the Grand Prix, Read entered the 1998/1999 season ranked within the top 64, at 62nd, but his best showing that season came at the UK Championship, where he reached the last 32 before losing 5–9 to Lawler(However, his 1st round opponent, Ronnie O'Sullivan withdrew from the match due to exhaustion). He qualified once in his career for the final stages of the World Championship at the Crucible Theatre, in the 2000 edition of the event. However, after beating Davis, Neal Foulds and Morgan to qualify, he lost 4–10 in the first round to the eventual champion, Mark Williams.\nThe 2000 World Championship was the last time Read featured at the venue stage of a ranking tournament; with poor performances in qualifying events between 2000 and 2003, he slipped from 63rd in the rankings for the 1999–2000 season to 98th at the end of 2002–03, and at that time was relegated from the main tour."

An athlete's total World Cup Score is the sum of all World Cup points earned in the season, minus the points from 2 events in which the athlete got their worst scores.

        "text": "The Philippines participated at the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta and Palembang, Indonesia from 18 August to 2 September 2018. The country won 21 medals (4 gold, 2 silver, and 15 bronze) to finish 19th overall in the medal tally of the games; an improvement from 22nd place placement of the country in the previous 2014 edition. However this came short of the 15th place target set by officials who deemed the actual placement as acceptable. Two of the Philippines' gold medal came from golf, while the other two came from weightlifting and skateboarding.\nBackground.\nWushu Federation of the Philippines President Julian Camacho is the chef de mission for the Philippines' stint at the 2018 Asian Games. The Philippine Olympic Committee approved a proposal from Camacho that only gold and silver medalists at the 2017 Southeast Asian Games and medalist of any color from the previous edition of the continental competition would compete in the 2018 Asian Games. Camacho justifying the move stated that he wanted to make sure every athlete can contend for a medal but remained open in including bronze medalists and other athletes to the delegation who can prove their worth by \"figuring prominently in Asian-level tournaments\" until the deadline of the submission of lineups.\nThe Philippines plans to send around 200 athletes and it is expected the athletes in contact sports has the best chances of winning medals.\nCamacho, who was appointed by the past POC President Peping Cojuangco, filed his courtesy resignation as Chef de Mission in February 2018, following the election of new POC President Ricky Vargas. He was replaced by Richard Gomez, President of the Philippine Fencing Association and then City Mayor of Ormoc, Leyte.\nThe Philippine Sports Commission on their part expressed willingness to provide around up to for the Philippines' participation in the games. The government agency has also stated that it is willing to financially support \"young and potential athletes\" who will compete in the games.\nThe POC has submitted the final list of competing entries by names. A total of 272 national athletes competing in 31 sports will be fielded in for the 2018 Asian Games. 63 officials will also form part of the delegation.\nLarge part of the delegation attended the send-off ceremony hosted at the Malacañang Palace by President Rodrigo Duterte on August 13, 2018. Basketball player Jordan Clarkson will serve as the flag bearer of the Philippine delegation at the opening ceremony of the games on August 18, 2018 while skateboarder Margielyn Didal will be the flag bearer for the country at the closing ceremony.\nMedalists.\nThe following Philippine competitors won medals at the Games.\nBasketball.\nThe 2018 Philippines men's Asian Games basketball team, was a Filipino Asian Games team assembled for the basketball competition on 2018 Asian Games.\nThe basketball association of the Philippines, the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP) had to come up with an agreement with the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA), the top-tier league in the country so that the Philippines could participate in the men's basketball event of the Asian Games. The two organization had also to consider the national team's stint in the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualifiers.\nThe decided against forming a \"PBA Selection\" team since the PBA Board can't afford to suspend the league for a month and a half. They also considered sending a team of composed of Gilas Cadets or rookie national players along with Andray Blatche though they deemed such team as not competitive enough. They come to a consensus to send a national team largely composed of one PBA team; the TNT KaTropa to aid national team-related scheduling.\nThe Philippines reportedly will not field a women's team, also will not participate in 3x3, a discipline in basketball that will debut in the 2018 Games. The SBP planned to send a 3x3 team led by AJ Edu and Kobe Paras. They could not send the same squad that participated in the 2018 FIBA 3x3 World Cup since the 3x3 event is restricted to players aged 18 to 23 years old. The plan did not push through due to time constraints.\n5x5 basketball.\nThe 12-man line-up of the national men's basketball team was released on June 18, 2018. The line-up is composed by 8 players from TNT KaTropa and 4 players from the Gilas Pilipinas/Gilas Cadets program led by Andray Blatche. However, it did not push through due to suspensions given to some of its players who were involved in the Philippines–Australia basketball brawl. The PBA gave the go signal to the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters to represent the country instead of TNT KaTropa. On 5 August 2018, the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas reversed its decision to withdraw from the Asian Games, as well as announcing their 14-man pool for the continental meet.\nThe national federation attempted to secure clearance for Cleveland Cavaliers player Jordan Clarkson to play in the Asian Games from the NBA. The NBA initially did not consent and only allowed Clarkson to play for the national team in FIBA-sanctioned tournaments such as the 2010 FIBA World Championship qualifiers. Don Trollano was proposed to be Clarkson's replacement in the official lineup. The NBA later gave Clarkson consent, and issued a statement that he along with two of China's player competing in the Asian Games, Zhou Qi of the Houston Rockets and Ding Yanyuhang of the Dallas Mavericks, were given one-time exception to play in the Asian Games.\nMen's tournament.\nThe official lineup that will play at the 2018 Asian Games at Jakarta and Palembang, Indonesia.\nCanoeing.\nThe Philippine Canoe Kayak Dragonboat Federation will be sending 14 men's and 13 women's at the Games.\nTraditional boat race.\nMen\nWomen\nJudo.\nThe Philippines will participate in Judo at the Games with 5 athletes (2 men's and 3 women's):\nSoftball.\nThe Philippines women's national softball team qualified for the Asian Games by finishing second in the 2017 Asian Women's Softball Championship.\nPreliminary round.\nThe top four teams will advance to the Final round.\nVolleyball.\nThe Philippines participated in women's volleyball at the 2018 Asian Games.

This edition of the European Rowing Championships was for women only and was held from 17 to 19 August. Eleven countries contested five boat classes (W1x, W2x, W4x+, W4+, W8+). Men would three weeks later meet in Lucerne for the inaugural World Rowing Championships.\nGerman participation.\nThe rowing federations of East and West Germany met in July to discuss how their rowers should be represented. FISA did not recognise East Germany as a country and insisted on one German team per boat class. For women's rowing, the West German rowing federation did not want selection trials to be held and preferred that East German crews attend the event; this reflected the dominance of the East German women. For the men who were to compete at the inaugural World Rowing Championships in Switzerland some weeks later, selection trials were agreed on.\nMedal summary – women's events.\nA Romanian crew was entered for both the coxed four and the coxed quad sculls. They asked the British crew, who had a room in the boat house adjacent to the regatta course, whether they could use their beds between the finals races. Having won bronze in the coxed four, the Romanians were given \"Vitamin C\" injections by their doctors while using the British accommodation; or so they told their hosts. The Romanian crew went on to win gold in the coxed quad sculls."

        "text": "The 1964 European Rowing Championships were rowing championships held on the Bosbaan regatta course in the Dutch capital Amsterdam. Women competed from 31 July to 2 August. Men competed the following week from 6 to 9 August. Men competed in all seven Olympic boat classes (M1x, M2x, M2-, M2+, M4-, M4+, M8+), and women entered in five boat classes (W1x, W2x, W4x+, W4+, W8+). Many of the men competed two months later at the Olympic Games in Tokyo; women would first be allowed to compete at Olympic level in 1976.\nGerman participation.\nFISA, the International Rowing Federation, did not recognise East Germany as a country and insisted on one German team per boat class. The women, where East Germany was the dominant side, held their selection trials at the Olympic regatta course in Grünau in East Berlin on 24 and 25 July 1964. West Germany did not contest the coxed four and eight boat classes, and Karen Ulrich-Wolf won the single scull competition for the west as expected. East Germany won the competition in the remaining two boat classes – double scull and coxed quad scull.\nThe negotiations about the 1964 rowing competitions for men were even more protracted than usual as not only did a way forward for the 1964 European Rowing Championships had to be found, but rowing at the 1964 Summer Olympics two months later was also on the agenda. The negotiations were led by Willi Daume and Heinz Schöbel, presidents of the national Olympic committees of West and East Germany, respectively. In June 1964, West Germany insisted on one set of selection trials covering both the European and Olympic competitions. The tensions eased when it was agreed on 10 July that there would be separate selection trials for the two international competitions. It was agreed that some boat classes were to compete at a West German regatta course, and the remaining boat classes would meet at an East German venue. Four boats would start per race, with two for each country. The winning country would then be free to nominate rowers of their choice for that boat class, i.e. not necessarily those rowers who had won the race. Compared to the women, the situation was opposite, with West German rowers historically dominant; in 1963, they had won all boat classes.\nThe trials for coxed pairs, double sculls and coxless fours were held on 1 August at the Olympic rowing venue at Grünau in East Berlin, with East Germany winning the double scull race, and West Germany the other two classes. The following day, the remaining trials for single sculls, coxless pairs, coxed fours, and the eights were held in Duisburg. East Germany won in the single scull (Achim Hill) and the coxed pair classes; three qualifications compared to West Germany's four was the best East German result yet.\nAt a FISA meeting held in conjunction with the 1964 men's regatta, the East German rowing association asked for separate German teams to be allowed to compete in future. Like at the previous meeting in 1963, the motions was voted down.\nMedal summary – women's events.\nThe Soviet Union was, once again, the most successful nation in the women's events, with three gold medals.\nMedal summary – men's events.\nAll finals were held on Sunday, 9 August. The Soviet Union had boats in all seven classes, followed by Holland (six classes). West Germany, Denmark and Poland had four boats each in the finals. In the single scull event, the rowers that placed outside the medals were Murray Watkinson (NZL; fourth), Eugeniusz Kubiak (POL; fifth), and Gottfried Kottmann (SUI; sixth). In the coxless pair, the American brothers Joseph and Thomas Amlong came fourth, while the Soviet rowers Oleg Golovanov and Valentin Boreyko came fifth.\nMedals table.\nThe table shows the aggregate results for men and women with East and West Germany counted as separate countries. The overall winner was the Soviet Union with six gold medals, followed by East Germany and then West Germany with three and two gold medals, respectively."

East German crews did not attend the championships.\nGerman participation.\nFISA, the International Rowing Federation, did not recognise East Germany as a country and insisted on one German team per boat class. In June 1965, the East German rowing federation put an application to the world governing body to be recognised as an independent state; this was the seventh time that they had applied for independence. There was insufficient time to discuss the issue at the congress held in Duisburg just prior to the men's competition, but FISA president Thomas Keller said that an extra-ordinary congress to be held in November in Vienna would discuss the issue, and that he personally saw no problem with solving the problems.\nEast German teams did not compete at these championships. Helena Smalman-Smith, who maintains a website on English women's rowing, puts forward three theories about their absence: there was \"the possibility of defection from an event in West Germany\", \"not wanting the athletes to see how much more prosperous the western part of their country\" had become, and putting pressure on FISA to change their stance on a combined German team.\nMedal summary – women's events.\nThe finals for the women were held on 22 August.\nMedal summary – men's events.\nThe regatta for men was held from 26 to 29 August.

This edition of the European Rowing Championships was held from 1 to 3 September for women, and from 7 to 10 September for men. Women entered in five boat classes (W1x, W2x, W4x+, W4+, W8+), and 14 countries sent 40 boats. For the first time, a women's team from outside Europe attended the championships, with the USA sending two boats. Men competed in all seven Olympic boat classes (M1x, M2x, M2-, M2+, M4-, M4+, M8+), and 24 or 25 countries (sources vary) sent 113 boats. Three non-European countries sent some (male) rowers: the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.\nMedal summary – women's events.\nJust six boats were nominated for the eight event, meaning that the six teams (East Germany, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, Romania, and Czechoslovakia) proceeded straight to the final. Heats and semi-finals were held for the other four boat classes as needed. The woman competed over a 1,000 m distance at the time.\nMedal summary – men's events.\nThe regatta for men was opened in the presence of François Missoffe, the French minister for youths and sport. No country qualified all their seven boats for the finals. East Germany, West Germany, and the United States had six of their boats in the finals, and the Soviet Union had qualified five boats. East Germany was the most successful nation, with five of their six finalists winning medals, including two gold. Achim Hill, who after winning single scull gold was looking back over a long rowing career, commented that \"as an old men, I'm having a second spring\". Denmark was one of the finalists in the coxless pair but did not start as their stroke had fallen ill. During the finals, the first and the last race were photo finishes for the silver medals. In the coxed four race, East Germany narrowly beat Romania for silver, with the Soviet Union taking gold. In the men's eight, traditionally the last race, West Germany won its only gold medal. The United States was just 0.03 seconds ahead of the Soviet Union for second place.\nMedals table.\nThe table shows the aggregate results for men and women. The overall winner was East Germany with four and five gold and silver medals, respectively. The Soviet Union came a close second with the same number of gold medals, but just two silver medals, plus two bronze medals. A total of eleven countries won medals."

This edition of the European Rowing Championships was for women only and was held from 16 to 18 August. Twelve or fifteen countries (sources vary) contested five boat classes (W1x, W2x, W4x+, W4+, W8+), and 39 teams competed. Despite the European label of the event, it was open to any country and was regarded as unofficial world championships, but all contesting countries in 1968 were from Europe. The men would meet in Mexico City in mid-October at the 1968 Summer Olympics.\nBackground.\nThe International Rowing Federation (FISA) had trouble finding a willing host for the 1968 Championships. The matter had been discussed at the FISA congress held in conjunction with the 1967 European Rowing Championships in Vichy. At that same meeting, East Germany had its membership status elevated from associate to ordinary. Delighted with the new status, the president of the East German rowing association, , volunteered to check whether his country could host the championships, and the eventual answer was positive. The chosen venue was the Grünau Regatta Course, which had previously been used for the 1936 Summer Olympics, and later for the 1962 European Rowing Championships. Grünau was confirmed by FISA in early March 1968.\nIn early June, the Deutsche Post of the GDR issued three stamps depicting notable sporting events in East Germany that year. One of the designs by graphic designer shows a single sculling woman with reference to the upcoming European Championships.\nThe 15 countries reported to compete (another source mentions 12 countries only, but does not list them) were the Soviet Union, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, England, Austria, Denmark, France, West Germany, and the host country East Germany. Of those, only the Soviet Union, Romania, and East Germany had boats in all five classes.\nMedal summary – women's events.\nThe regatta started with an opening event on the evening of 15 August. The heats were rowed the next day. Any semi-finals were held on 17 August, and the finals were held on Sunday, 18 August. Gisela Jäger and Rita Schmidt surprisingly won gold in the double sculls after just four weeks of training together. The long-standing double sculling partners Monika Sommer and Ursula Pankraths were to represent East Germany, but Sommer fell ill and new sculling teams were formed, of which Jäger and Schmidt were chosen for the European Championships. In the eight event, only five boats were listed, hence the final was the first competition for these boats. East Germany surprisingly won over the favourite team from Romania. Initially, the Soviet Union was awarded second place, but was disqualified later due to having caused two false starts. Czechoslovakia came fourth."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career fielding errors as an outfielder leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, an error is an act, in the judgment of the official scorer, of a fielder misplaying a ball in a manner that allows a batter or baserunner to advance one or more bases or allows an at bat to continue after the batter should have been put out. An outfielder (OF) is a person playing in one of the three defensive positions in baseball farthest from the batter, who are identified as the left fielder (LF), the center fielder (CF), and the right fielder (RF). An outfielder's duty is to try to catch long fly balls before they hit the ground, or to quickly catch or retrieve and return to the infield any other balls entering the outfield. Outfielders normally play behind the six other members of the defense who play in or near the infield; unlike catchers and most infielders (excepting first basemen), who are virtually exclusively right-handed, outfielders can be either right- or left-handed. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the outfielders are assigned the numbers 7 (left field), 8 (center field) and 9 (right field).\nThe list of career leaders is dominated by players from the 19th century when fielding equipment was very rudimentary; baseball gloves only began to steadily gain acceptance in the 1880s, and were not uniformly worn until the mid-1890s, resulting in a much lower frequency of defensive miscues. The top 13 players in career errors began playing in the 19th century, most of them playing their entire careers before 1900; none of the 13 were active after 1905, and none of the top 29 were active after 1929. Most of the top 78 played entirely in the 19th century, with only four making their major league debut after 1920; only one was active after 1945. The top 42 single-season totals were all recorded before 1896, the top 100 were recorded before 1904, and the top 459 were recorded before 1937. To a large extent, the leaders reflect longevity rather than lower skill. Roberto Clemente, who became the first National League (NL) outfielder in over 40 years to commit 140 errors, won twelve Gold Glove Awards for defensive excellence.\nBecause game accounts and box scores often did not distinguish between the outfield positions, there has been some difficulty in determining precise defensive statistics prior to 1901; because of this, and because of the similarity in their roles, defensive statistics for the three positions are frequently combined. Tom Brown, who retired in 1898 after setting major league records for career games and assists as an outfielder, is the all-time leader in career errors committed by an outfielder with 492, more than twice as many as any outfielder who began playing after 1910; he is the only outfielder to be charged with more than 400 career errors. Dummy Hoy (394), Paul Hines (385), Jesse Burkett (383), George Gore (368), Jimmy Ryan (366), George Van Haltren (358), and Ned Hanlon (350) are the only other outfielders to commit more than 300 career errors. Justin Upton, who had 89 errors through the 2022 season to place him tied for 222nd all-time, is the leader among active players."

The defending champion Anna Veith (competing as Fenninger in 2014) was second, and Tina Weirather was third, the first Olympic medal for Liechtenstein since 1988. The results were extraordinarily dense, with 0.01 seconds separating gold and silver medals, as well as bronze medal from the fourth place (Lara Gut). Ledecká's victory was completely unexpected, as she had been much better known for her snowboarding achievements. She subsequently won the parallel giant slalom snowboarding competition at the same Olympics.\nLindsey Vonn, starting first, was leading until her time was improved by Johanna Schnarf, then Lara Gut. Weirather, skiing seventh, improved Gut's time by 0.01 seconds, pushing Vonn, 0.26 seconds behind, off the podium. Starting 15th, Veith took the lead, with the main competitors either not finishing or posting inferior times, so that she believed her first place was assured, and some agencies announced her as a champion. However, the surprising champion was Ledecká who started 26th and improved Veith's time by 0.01. Ledecká's relative lack of experience in the super-G event might have led to her victory, as she took a more aggressive line that other, more experienced skiers shied away from. After the finish, Ledecká did not believe she won and thought that somebody else's time was shown by mistake.\nThe race course was in length, with a vertical drop of from a starting elevation of above sea level. Ledecká's winning time of 81.11 seconds yielded an average speed of and an average vertical descent rate of .\nResults.\nThe race was started at 12:00 local time, (UTC+9).

It was held in Allen Park, MI on May 4-6.\nOn March 21, 2018, Fox Sports announced that it had acquired the television rights for the PBA Tour, replacing ESPN, with 26 broadcasts on Fox Sports 1 and four on Fox beginning in 2019. Fox aired an additional PBA Clash event on December 23, 2018, which served as Fox's debut bowling broadcast and as a prelude for the 2019 season. This broadcast drew a live TV audience of 1.768 million viewers, the highest audience for a bowling broadcast on any network since 2005.\nDue to the new agreement, the World Series of Bowling and PBA World Championship were postponed from the 2018 season and moved to March 2019, in order to have them be part of Fox's 2019 schedule. They were replaced on the schedule with a reinstated PBA Fall Swing, held in the Tulsa suburb of Owasso, Oklahoma. This event consisted of two standalone title events (Wolf Open and Bear Open), with these events serving as initial qualifying for the PBA Tulsa Open.\nSeason awards.\nThe PBA announced its 2018 season awards on November 20.\nTournament summary.\nMajor tournaments are in bold. Career PBA title numbers for winners are shown in parentheses (#). \nIn late 2017, the PBA released a list of 16 oil patterns that would debut with the 2017 PBA World Series of Bowling and continue into 2018. The patterns now include both a name and number, with the number representing the oil length (in feet). There are nine \"Animal\" oil patterns: Cheetah 33, Wolf 33, Viper 36, Chameleon 39, Bear 39, Scorpion 42, Shark 45, Dragon 45, and Badger 52. (The Badger 52 pattern will not be used in 2018.) There are also seven \"Legends\" patterns: Johnny Petraglia 36, Don Carter 39, Don Johnson 40, Earl Anthony 42, Mark Roth 42, Carmen Salvino 44, and Dick Weber 45. "

        "text": "The 1961 European Rowing Championships were rowing championships held on the Vltava (Moldau) in the Czechoslovakian capital Prague. The event for women was held from 18 to 20 August, and 9 countries competed with 32 boats. The event for men was held from 24 to 27 August, and 20 countries entered boats. Men competed in all seven Olympic boat classes (M1x, M2x, M2-, M2+, M4-, M4+, M8+), and just three countries entered boats in all classes: the hosts Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and a combined German team. Women entered in five boat classes (W1x, W2x, W4x+, W4+, W8+). The regatta was held in five lanes, with rowers proceeding in the direction of the river's flow.\nGerman representation.\nGermany had to enter a combined team. The women from both countries had a qualification event on the Langer See in Grünau, which had previously been used as the rowing venue for the 1936 Summer Olympics. The West Germans entered the three sculling boat classes only (W1x, W2x, W4x+), and in all events, the East Germans won the competition. East German teams for the coxed four and the eight complemented a complete team.\nEast Germany nominated its men at the end of July, and following the West German national championships, the West Germans nominated their men's team in early August. There were difficult negotiations between West and East German representatives as to the location for the German qualifications. In the end, the regatta facility on the Templiner See in Potsdam favoured by East Germany was agreed to. The German qualifications were decided on 12 August, with West Germany winning all seven races.\nMedal summary.\nMedallists at the 1961 European Rowing Championships were:\nWomen's events.\nOf the nine countries that were represented, only three were from western Europe: Great Britain (coxed four, double scull, single scull), Belgium and the Netherlands (both single scull). Of those, only Britain managed to get two of their boats into the finals; Penny Chuter came fourth in the single scull, and they came fifth in the coxed four. The most successful nation in the women's events was the Soviet Union, with four out of a possible five gold medals.\nMen's events.\nThe most successful nation was the Soviet Union, which won three gold medals.\nMedals tables.\nThe first table shows the aggregate results for men and women with Germany counted as one country. The overall winner was the Soviet Union with seven gold medals, followed by Germany and then Italy with two gold medals each, but Germany also winning three silver medals whilst Italy did not win silver.\nThe second table shows the aggregate results for men and women with East Germany and West Germany counted as separate countries; all male German winners were West Germans while all female German winners were from the east. The overall winner remains the Soviet Union with seven gold medals, followed by West Germany and then Italy with two gold medals each, but West Germany also winning one silver medal whilst Italy did not win silver. East Germany is ranked sixth with this method of counting medals."

        "text": "The 1989–90 Ball State Cardinals men's basketball team represented Ball State University as a member of the Mid-American Conference during the 1989–90 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. After the departure of head coach Rick Majerus, Ball State responded under new coach Dick Hunsaker by having the best season in the school's history. This group of Cardinals became the first team in the Mid-American Conference history to win two consecutive MAC regular season conference championships as well as back-to-back conference tournament titles. The 1990 Ball State basketball team also became the first team in the MAC to reach the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament in its current format. The Cardinals lost in the Sweet 16 to the eventual national champions UNLV Runnin' Rebels, 69–67.\nThe team was led by many transfer players and two of Coach Hunsaker’s key transfers, starting forwards Paris McCurdy and Curtis Kidd, were high school teammates. They both signed to play their college ball at the University of Arkansas-Little Rock. However, because of disciplinary reasons, the two had to find a new school. Former coach Rick Majerus gave them a second chance, and they came through. The two became the key assets to Ball States Sweet 16 run.\nThe Cardinals finished the regular season at 24-6 before heading to the NCAA tournament. The Cardinals were a 12 seed and began the tournament at the Huntsman Center in Salt Lake City. They upset the Oregon State Beavers in what was star point guard Gary Payton’s last game in college. They won the game when McCurdy made a three-point play with no time left. Ball State then had to play the Louisville Cardinals next. They ended up defeating Louisville late in the game by a final score of 62–60. Meanwhile, in Muncie, fans stormed the village (the center of Ball State's off campus social scene) after the win. Ball State advanced to face the top-seeded UNLV Runnin' Rebels. Ball State shut down one of the best offenses in college basketball history and had a chance to win it in the final seconds. Down by two, the Cards made a deep pass to tie or take the lead but it was picked off.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| MAC regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| MAC tournament\n!colspan=9 style=| NCAA tournament"

        "text": "The women's 7.5 km sprint competition of the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympics was held on 10 February 2018 at the Alpensia Biathlon Centre in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\nSummary.\nThe field included the defending champion Anastasiya Kuzmina (who also won gold in 2010), the 2014 bronze medalist Vita Semerenko, and the 2010 bronze medalist Marie Dorin Habert. None of them returned to the podium, although Dorin Habert finished in the 4th position.\nKuzmina had the best time in the first 2.5 km but missed twice in the prone shooting and was out of medal contention after that. After the shooting, Dorothea Wierer was leading, closely followed by several athletes, but she missed twice at the standing shooting and dropped out of contention as well. After the second shooting, Laura Dahlmeier was the only athlete in the leading group who had not missed any targets. She had a lead of 13 seconds over Veronika Vítková and Marte Olsbu, and more than 20 seconds over other athletes. However, Vítková and Olsbu were early starters, and Dahlmeier did not have difficulties preserving the lead and eventually finishing in first position. Olsbu, who started just before Vítková, and after the second shooting was behind her by 0.1 seconds, won over a second on the last stretch, which was sufficient for an eventual silver medal. Vítková remained in the bronze medal position. Lisa Vittozzi, Irene Cadurisch, and Paulína Fialková were all losing about 10 seconds to Vítková and Olsbu after the second shooting (and all started after them and after Dahlmeier), but ran slower than they did. Dorin Habert was losing 13 seconds to Vítková and ran faster, but came to the finish in fourth position, 8 seconds behind Olsbu.\nIn the victory ceremony, the medals were presented by Valeriy Borzov, member of the International Olympic Committee, accompanied by Anders Besseberg, president of the IBU.\nResults.\nThe race was started at 20:15."

        "text": "In baseball statistics, an error is an act, in the judgment of the official scorer, of a fielder misplaying a ball in a manner that allows a batter or baserunner to advance one or more bases or allows an at bat to continue after the batter should have been put out. Shortstop, abbreviated SS, is a baseball or softball fielding position in the infield, commonly stationed between second and third base, which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions. The position is mostly filled by defensive specialists, so shortstops are generally relatively poor batters who typically hit lower in the batting order. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the shortstop is assigned the number 6.\nThe list of career leaders is dominated by players from the 19th century when fielding equipment was very rudimentary; baseball gloves only began to steadily gain acceptance in the 1880s, and were not uniformly worn until the mid-1890s, resulting in a much lower frequency of defensive miscues. 13 of the top 18 players in career errors began playing in the 19th century, six of whom played their entire careers before 1900; only one of the top 24 made their major league debut after 1915, and none of the top 38 were active after 1950. The top 12 single-season totals were all recorded before 1894, the top 61 were recorded before 1909, and the top 187 were recorded before 1919; none of the top 500 have been recorded since 1951. To a large extent, the leaders reflect longevity rather than lower skill. Luis Aparicio, whose 366 errors are the most by any American League (AL) shortstop since 1940, won nine Gold Glove Awards for defensive excellence, and retired with the second highest fielding percentage in AL history.\nHerman Long, who retired in 1904 after setting major league records for games and putouts as a shortstop, is the all-time leader in errors committed as a shortstop with 1,070, nearly three times as many as any shortstop active since 1960, and the most by any player at a single position in major league history; he is the only shortstop to commit over 1,000 career errors. Bill Dahlen (975), Germany Smith (973), and Tommy Corcoran (961) are the only other shortstops to commit over 900 career errors. Elvis Andrus, who had 219 errors through the 2022 season to place him 120th all-time, is the leader among active players."

        "title": "Water Polo Canada",
        "text": "Water Polo Canada, officially the Canadian Water Polo Association Inc., is the governing body of the sport of water polo in Canada and is a member of the World aquatics or (FINA). Water Polo Canada controls all water polo in the country and is responsible for hosting national championships and fielding national teams. The organization has its headquarters in Ottawa while its men's national team is based in Montreal and its women's national team is based in Montreal.\nHistory.\nWater polo has been played in Canada since the early 20th century, and since 1907 Canada has held a national club championship, the Goulden Cup. Until the 1960s, however, only Eastern-Canadian teams participated in the event. In 1964 the Canadian Water Polo Association was officially founded and had as its first president Frank Medek of Montreal. That year Canada hosted its first truly national club championship, which featured teams from Vancouver, Calgary, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec. The tournament, held in Gravenhurst, was won by Toronto. The following year the national championships left the east for the first time and were held in Edmonton. From 1966 to 1976 Dr. John Richardson was president of the Association. During this era Richardson oversaw Canada's participation in 3 Olympic Games.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s water polo in Canada grew significantly and its national team programs expanded. Today, water polo is played in all ten provinces. In 2014 Water Polo Canada founded the National Championship League (NCL), a national domestic league which features 13U, 15U, 17U, 19U, and senior categories.\nWho can play water polo.\nWater polo can be enjoyed at the recreational level and at the competitive level by both male and female players.\nNCL (National Championship League).\nThe National Championship League (NCL) was created in 2014 to bring the domestic club age group programs under a country wide umbrella that promotes the development of the sport.  \nThe NCL offers four categories of play: Senior, 19U, 17U, and 15U. \nSenior.\nThe Senior category runs from December to early May and features a format of separate event weekends. The country is split into Eastern and Western conferences and the standing from each event weekend determine who qualifies for the Senior National Championships, where the Canadian champions are crowned.  \nEastern events will be divided into two tiers. The tiers will maximize the number of meaningful games that are played through the course of a season. Promotion and relegation opportunities will exist at the end of each event and a playoff into the Senior National Championship qualifier will take place. \n19U.\nThe 19U category will be a single event to act as National Club Championship. 19U teams are recommended to be joining the Senior divisions to access league play. Beyond that, Provinces and clubs provide 19U competitions of their own throughout Canada run independently of Water Polo Canada. \n17U.\nThe 17U category runs from November to May and features a format of separate event weekends. The country is split into Eastern and Western conferences and the standing from each event weekend determine the rankings going into the Conference Championship weekends. These Conference Championship weekends, one for the Eastern teams and one for the Western teams, serve as the qualification for the 17U National Finals weekend with the top four teams from each Conference qualifying hosted in May.  Eastern events will be divided into two tiers. The tiers will maximize the number of meaningful games that are played through the course of a season. Promotion and relegation opportunities will exist at the end of each event and a playoff into the 17U Eastern Finals will take place.\n15U.\nThe 15U category, consists of two Championship events, an Eastern National Championship and a Western National Championship. The top 15U teams from each province, as determined by each Provincial Sport Organization, qualify for either the Eastern or Western National Championships depending on their region. The Eastern National Championship and Western National Championship are hosted by WPC in April/May of each year and determine the top 15U team in each half of the country. \nTeams.\nThe Canadian water polo senior men's club championship, the Goulden Cup, is one of Canada's oldest amateur sporting events, having been contested since 1907. Water Polo Canada also stages national club championships for senior women (since 1977), junior men (since 1927), junior women (since 1985), 18U men (since 1985), 18U women (since 1987), 16U men (since 1995), and 16U women (since 1995).\nNational teams.\nCanada fielded its first national team in 1963. This squad, coached by Jeno Ats, participated in the 1963 Pan American Games. After Brazil dropped out, Canada was afforded a place in the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. Coached again by Ats, Canada placed 16th. As host, Canada participated in the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. Led by Dezső Lemhényi, assisted by Ivan Somlai, it placed its best-ever 9th. Due to the iron curtain boycott, Canada got a spot in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Coached by Gábor Csepregi, Canada finished 10th. In 2008, coached by Dragan Jovanović, the Canadian squad placed 11th. Canada's men's national team is based at the Olympic Pool in Montreal and is coached by Pat Oaten.\nCanada has fielded a women's national team since 1978. The women's squad participated in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, the first to hold a women's water polo competition. At this tournament Canada placed fifth.

        "title": "Nancy Wilson (basketball)",
        "text": "Nancy Wilson (born October 18, 1951) is a former professional and college basketball coach. She coached the College of Charleston women's basketball (CoC), the University of South Carolina women's basketball (SC), and the professional Seattle Reign of the American Basketball League (ABL). Wilson would establish the program records for the most wins as a head coach at both the College of Charleston and South Carolina, and still owns the career wins totals at CoC. Wilson led both programs to numerous conference championships as well as AIAW and NCAA tournament appearances. Wilson has spent 30 years as a college head coach, compiling a record of 542–365\nEarly years.\nBorn in Lake City, South Carolina, Wilson attended Lake City High School, graduating in 1969. She attended Coker College in Hartsville, SC, graduating in 1973 with a bachelor's degree in Physical Education. She was a member of the college's first intercollegiate women's basketball team, and also competed in intercollegiate field hockey. She would later obtain her master's degree in Physical Education from The Citadel in 1982.\nCollege of Charleston (first stint).\nSoon after graduating from Coker College, Wilson was hired as an assistant coach for the College of Charleston women's basketball team in 1973. The team was then in the AIAW Division II. She worked for head coach Joan Cronan, and also coached the college's volleyball team. In 1976 Wilson succeeded Cronan as the head coach of the women's basketball program as Cronan focused more on her position as the Director of Women's Athletics.\nWilson led the Cougars to quick success, leading the team to a 21–5 record her first season as head coach, and beginning with the 1979–80 season reached the AIAW Division II national championship game three years in a row. During this eight-season period at College of Charleston Wilson compiled a 193–64 record. Wilson was named the SCAIAW Coach of the Year three times, and shared National Coach of the Year honors in 1982. The success led Wilson to be offered the job to coach South Carolina in 1984.\nUniversity of South Carolina.\nWilson spent 13 years as head coach at South Carolina beginning with the 1984–85 season. During the early years of Wilson's tenure when South Carolina was a member of the Metro Conference, Wilson built the program into a dominant presence within the conference, winning five regular season titles and three conference tournament championships. Wilson led the Gamecocks to five NCAA Tournament appearances, all during their Metro Conference years, including an appearance in the Sweet Sixteen in 1989–90. Wilson was named Metro Conference Coach of the Year in 1985 and 1991.\nWhen South Carolina joined the more competitive Southeastern Conference beginning with the 1991–92 season however, the success was harder to come by. Still by her final season of 1996–97, Wilson held the program's all-time wins record with a 231–149 showing, that remained SC's record until passed by head coach Dawn Staley on December 21, 2017\nSeattle Reign.\nWilson joined the American Basketball League's Seattle Reign as the associate head coach in 1997 under Tammy Holder, Wilson's former assistant coach at SC. The Reign went 15–29 in Wilson's first season on the staff. They began to realize substantial improvements during her 2nd season, but the league was struggling to compete against the new Women's National Basketball League (WNBA), and in a surprising move declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the middle of the following season, on December 22, 1998. The Reign were 8–7 at the time.\nCollege of Charleston (second stint).\nAfter her time in the ABL, Wilson returned to South Carolina and took a job at the College of Charleston teaching physical education classes. While there she was persuaded in 2003 by a member of the administration to return as head coach of the women's basketball team, beginning with the 2003–04 season.\nSuccess did not come as immediately nor as consistently for her second tour as it did for her first, as she compiled a 118–152 over nine seasons. She did however lead the program to its best season in Division I basketball in 2008–09, when the team set program single-season records with 14 conference wins in the Southern Conference, and with 23 wins overall. Further, College of Charleston won a school-record nine consecutive games that season, and advanced to its first-ever Southern Conference Tournament championship game.\n2008–09 was also the season that Wilson became the 24th active Division I coach at the time in NCAA history to reach 500 career victories, with a 63–43 win over Georgia Southern on Feb. 16, 2009.\nWilson would lead CoC to another strong season in 2009–10 finishing 21–12 (13–7), but then the team would falter to 10–20 (7–13) and 7–23 (6–14) results in 2010–11 and 2011–12, respectively. Prior to the 2011–12 season, Wilson announced that she would be retiring from coaching at the conclusion of that season."

        "title": "Junior Basketball Association",
        "text": "The Junior Basketball Association (JBA) was an American basketball league that intended to be an alternative to the NCAA by allowing high school and junior college players to immediately play professionally. The league was first announced in December 2017 by LaVar Ball and was said to be fully funded by Ball's sports apparel company, Big Baller Brand. The JBA existed for just one season in 2018, featuring eight teams from major US cities.\nWhile the league has not formally folded, no future seasons have been announced. The JBA faced criticism from within for failing to honor its contracts and pay its players and is widely seen as having been created solely as a platform for LaVar Ball's sons, disregarding the futures and livelihoods of the sixty other players in the competition. With the discontinuation of the league, former JBA players were left without a job and their brief $3,000 per month income removed their eligibility for NCAA basketball scholarships.\nHistory.\nOn December 20, 2017, \"SLAM\" magazine had first reported on the formation of the Junior Basketball Association after being sent a statement from LaVar Ball, the chief executive officer (CEO) of Big Baller Brand and father to Chicago Bulls player Lonzo Ball and his brothers, LiAngelo and LaMelo Ball. According to Ball, his decision to launch the league was prompted by comments from Mark Emmert, president of the NCAA. Earlier in the month, Emmert had remarked on LiAngelo's departure from UCLA following a shoplifting arrest in China: \"Is this a part of someone being part of your university as a student-athlete or is it about using college athletics to prepare yourself to be a pro? If it's the latter, you shouldn't be there in the first place.\"\nThe JBA was established as an alternative route for top amateur players to play professionally without having to compete at the college level for no money. During the 2018 season, each player was promised $3,000 per month, and 60 percent of their jersey sales, in addition to other endorsement deals. The JBA was fully funded by Big Baller Brand, and players were required to wear the brand's merchandise. The league was expected to pay for travel, food, and lodging expenses, although the source of its finances was not disclosed. Its official logo features LaVar Ball's son Lonzo.\nOn February 2, 2018, it was revealed that the JBA had directly messaged about 80 blue-chip high school basketball players through Twitter about potentially joining its league, with a vast majority declining the offer and none of them ultimately accepting. The league appointed former National Basketball Association (NBA) players Ed O'Bannon and Earl Watson, along with Lonzo Ball, to its advisory board and selection committee for choosing players who will compete in the league. In its inaugural tryouts, the JBA most notably signed Greg Floyd Jr., a four-star recruit from Las Vegas, and Kezo Brown, a Chicago native and former three-star point guard for Simeon Career Academy. The founder's youngest son LaMelo, a former five-star recruit with professional experience, also joined, being labeled by the league as its \"marquee player.\"\nNear the halfway mark of the 2018 JBA season, LaMelo's older brother LiAngelo Ball joined the league after previously stating that he would not participate.\nThe league's website was inactive for some time, however, the website has since relaunched but only sells JBA merchandise. The league has not made any official announcements of future seasons or if it has folded completely.\nFormat.\nThe JBA was made up of eight teams, with up to 10 players on each roster. The league only allowed players between the ages of 16 and 21 and accepts graduating seniors or students working towards a General Educational Development (GED), with rare exceptions being included. All teams featured players primarily handpicked from tryouts held before the season. According to the league, players who fail to play professional basketball would be able to work for Big Baller Brand.\nThe 2018 JBA season included an All-Star Game, playoffs, and finals. The regular season included eight games per team, with games taking place in venues across the United States. The champions of the inaugural season, the Los Angeles Ballers, were given Cadillac ATS vehicles as a reward from the league. Following an eight-team playoffs tournament, which concluded in August, the league scheduled a 28-game international tour from September to December 2018 in which its top players would face several European and Asian professional teams.\nThrough the 2018 season, the JBA aired games through Facebook Live with Allen Bell from the \"AB the HERO\" YouTube channel and Brandon Williams from \"Fresh Sports Talk\" as the broadcasters for each game.\nReception.\nShortly after JBA was announced in December 2017, Mike Golic of ESPN was among those who expressed doubts about the league's future. The \"Niagara Gazette\" considered the league as \"ambitious, but not original.\" On the other hand, \"The Root\" considered Ball's idea \"genius,\" and \"Salon\" believed that the JBA could \"force NCAA reform.\" Lonzo Ball, son of the JBA's founder, suggested that he would have preferred the JBA over college basketball had that option been around at the time. During the 2018 JBA season, multiple NBA players commented on the league, including CJ McCollum and Metta World Peace. In addition, Trae Young of the Atlanta Hawks attended a JBA game in Las Vegas.\nJBA tickets, which cost $99 for courtside seats, $59 for center court, and $40 for above center court, were criticized as \"unreasonably expensive\" by the \"USA Today\" website For the Win. The website also labeled JBA ticket sales as \"comically abysmal,\" with over 90 percent of seats still being available less than three weeks before the season opener. The \"New York Post\" wrote, \"In what should come a surprise to no one, LaVar Ball is struggling to find an audience with his newly launched Junior Basketball Association.\"\nOn August 16, 2018, Brandon Phillips, who was cut by the Los Angeles Ballers in the middle of the season to make way for LiAngelo Ball, alleged that he was only paid one-third of his promised salary while having to pay for travel costs. He later expressed regret for giving up his college basketball eligibility for a single paycheck of $1,000.\nAlthough the players were promised the proceeds of 60% of their jersey sales, no retail versions of JBA jerseys were ever produced or put on sale to the public."

        "title": "List of baseball parks in Nashville, Tennessee",
        "text": "Nashville, Tennessee, has hosted professional baseball teams since the late 19th century at five ballparks around the city. The first was Sulphur Spring Park, later renamed Athletic Park but best known as Sulphur Dell, which was the home of the city's minor league teams from 1885 to 1963. It was located just north of the Tennessee State Capitol in downtown Nashville. The facility was demolished in 1969.\nA number of Negro league teams competed at Sulphur Dell as well as at Greenwood Park, located across from Greenwood Cemetery, and Tom Wilson Park, north of the Nashville Fairgrounds, both of which were in Nashville's black communities and have since been demolished.\nHerschel Greer Stadium was built in 1978 on the grounds of Fort Negley just south of downtown. Greer served as the home of the Nashville Sounds for 37 seasons until they left for the new First Horizon Park, then known as First Tennessee Park, located at the site of Sulphur Dell, in 2015. Greer was demolished in 2019.\nBaseball parks.\nSulphur Dell.\nSulphur Spring Park, as Sulphur Dell was first known, was located in a bottomland, or dell, which was used by early settlers for trading and watering at a natural sulphur spring. In the 1850s, a portion of the land was re-purposed for baseball. By 1870, the baseball grounds were referred to as \"Athletic Park\". In 1885, a wooden grandstand was built at the corner of modern-day Fourth Avenue North and Jackson Street to accommodate fans of the Nashville Americans, who were charter members of the original Southern League. Several other minor league teams followed the Americans, but the ballpark's longest tenant was the Southern Association's Nashville Vols, who played there from 1901 to 1963. Sportswriter Grantland Rice started referring to the ballpark as \"Sulphur Spring Dell\" in 1908, which he later shortened to \"Sulphur Dell\".\nThe original grandstand was situated with home plate facing the southwest toward the Tennessee State Capitol building. Consequently, batters would often have to compete with the afternoon sunlight shining in their eyes. After the 1926 season, the entire ballpark was demolished and rebuilt as a concrete-and-steel structure with home plate in the southwest corner facing northeast along Fourth Avenue North. Sulphur Dell's infamous outfield was born out of this realignment. The second configuration included a significant \"terrace\" or sloping outfield: a steep incline that ran along the entire outfield wall, most dramatically in right and center fields.\nIn its prime, Sulphur Dell was nestled in an area that was home to the city's garbage dump, stockyards, and various warehouses. The Vols left after the conclusion of the 1963 season. Amateur baseball teams played there in 1964, and it was converted to a speedway for three weeks in 1965. The stadium then served as a tow-in lot for Metro Nashville, before being demolished on April 16, 1969. Until 2014, it was the location of a number of parking lots used by state employees. In 2015, the city built First Tennessee Park on the site.\nGreenwood Park.\nGreenwood Park, established in 1905, was a public park for Nashville's black community. In addition to picnic space, amusement riders, and a swimming pool, the grounds were home to a baseball diamond used by the independent Nashville Standard/Elite Giants from 1920 to 1928 and other Negro league teams. The park was demolished after its 1949 closure.\nTom Wilson Park.\nTom Wilson Park was located in what was at the time Nashville's largest black community, known as Trimble Bottom, near the convergence of Second and Forth Avenues, just north of the fairgrounds. It opened in 1929 to serve as the home park for owner Thomas T. Wilson's Nashville Elite Giants, a Negro league team which competed in several circuits from 1929 to 1930 and 1932 to 1934. The ballpark also served as a spring training site for other Negro league teams. Wilson discontinued all baseball activities at the park in 1946, and it was later demolished.\nHerschel Greer Stadium.\nHerschel Greer Stadium, located on the grounds of Fort Negley, an American Civil War fortification, was opened in 1978 for the Nashville Sounds, an expansion franchise of the Double-A Southern League who moved to the Triple-A American Association in 1985 and to the Triple-A Pacific Coast League in 1998. The facility closed at the end of the 2014 baseball season, after which the Sounds left for the new First Tennessee Park. Greer remained deserted for over four years until its demolition in 2019.\nAmidst the Sounds' 37-season run, Greer simultaneously hosted two professional baseball clubs in 1993 and 1994, acting as a temporary home to a displaced Southern League franchise known during that period as the Nashville Xpress. They were named for the railroad tracks located just beyond the right-center field wall to the stadium's east-southeast. Greer was best recognized by its distinctive guitar-shaped scoreboard, which measured across, high, and deep.\nFirst Horizon Park.\nFirst Horizon Park, located downtown on the site of the former Sulphur Dell, is the second ballpark used by the Nashville Sounds, who relocated from Greer Stadium in 2015. The $91 million stadium has a fixed seating capacity of 8,500 people, but can accommodate up to 10,000 with additional grass berm seating. One of First Horizon Park's most recognizable features, like Greer Stadium before it, is a guitar-shaped scoreboard beyond the right-center field wall."

This marked the return of the territory to the Winter Olympics for the first time since 2002. It was represented by only one athlete, alpine skier Charles Flaherty.\nBackground.\nIn 2002, the bobsleigh team that was set to compete for the team was withdrawn as one athlete (Michael Gonzales) did not meet Puerto Rico Olympic Committee rules about eligibility. After this, the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee withdrew the recognition of the Winter Sports Federation for the island territory, effectively ending any hopes for athletes competing at the Winter Olympics. Alpine skier Kristina Krone qualified to represent the territory at both the 2010 and 2014 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and Sochi respectively. However, both times the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee refused to even acknowledge her qualification and the territory did not compete. In December 2017, the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee allowed a six-month temporary membership to the Winter Sports Federation, thus allowing the territory to compete at the 2018 Games. Although Charles Flaherty was born in the mainland United States, he has resided in Puerto Rico for several years, which gave him eligibility to compete for the territory. (Charles Flaherty's brother William Flaherty later represented Puerto Rico at the 2022 Winter Olympics.)\nCompetitors.\nThe following is the list of number of competitors participating in the Puerto Rican delegation per sport.\nAlpine skiing.\nPuerto Rico qualified one male athlete, Charles Flaherty."

        "text": "The Philippines competed at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, from 9 to 25 February 2018. The country was represented by two male athletes, a figure skater and an alpine skier.\nBackground.\nThe Philippines made its second consecutive participation at the Winter Olympic Games after they participated in the 2014 edition in Sochi, Russia. They had previously achieved this feat when they participated in the 1988 and 1992 editions.\nMichael Christian Martinez, the sole competitor for the Philippines in 2014, originally failed to qualify for the 2018 edition of the Games after failing to secure qualification through the 2017 CS Nebelhorn Trophy. However, after Sweden returned their quota spot in January 2018, the Philippines was assigned the quota spot, thereby allowing Michael Christian Martinez to compete in the Olympics.\nThe Philippines was also assigned a quota spot for a male athlete in alpine skiing by the International Ski Federation. Asa Miller, who was also the country's flag bearer in the opening ceremony, is set to compete for the Philippines in the sport.\nTom Carrasco, Jr., who is the \"chef de mission\" for the Philippine delegation, has said he is \"not expecting much\" from the participation and is just looking to build experience of the athletes.\nCompetitors.\nThe following is the list of number of competitors which participated in the delegation per sport.\nAlpine skiing.\nThe Philippines achieved the following quota place.\nThe country's single quota place was filled in by Asa Miller. Miller, who resides in Oregon within the United States, is allowed to compete for the Philippines due to his dual citizenship. Miller made a fundraising campaign through GoFundMe for his Olympic stint though the Philippine Olympic Committee has volunteered to finance his expenses. Miller is the first Filipino born in the 2000s to qualify for the Winter Olympics.\nIn the giant slalom event contested on February 18, Miller entered the course at 104th in both the 1st and 2nd runs. In the first run, Miller had a slight slip but was able to finish the course clocking 1:27.52 for 81st place while in the second run he recorded a time of 1:22.43 for 68th place. His total run for the giant slalom was 2:49.95 finishing 70th overall. 110 skiers participated. Among them only 85 completed the first run, and 75 finished the second and final run. Miller's total time was 31.91 seconds behind gold medalist Marcel Hirscher of Austria.\nFigure skating.\nThe Philippines achieved the following quota place.\nMichael Christian Martinez is the sole competitor for the Philippines in figure skating. He initially failed to qualify for Winter Olympics after not making a sufficient finish at the CS Nebelhorn Trophy in September 2017. On January 23, 2018, he was informed that he is eligible to participate in the Games after Sweden returned a quota place and went back to training. At that time he had already retired from figure skating to focus in body building and had to crash diet to reduce his weight from to .\nHe and his coach, Slava Zagor left for Pyeongchang from Los Angeles on February 5, 2018.\nMartinez was the sixth to skate in the short program skated to the tune of “Emerald Tiger” by Vanessa-Mae in the short program where he accumulated a total of 55.56 points (26.04 points credited to elements performed). He placed 28th among 30 competitors besting only Felipe Montoya of Spain and Yaroslav Paniot of Ukraine and failed to advance to the free skate program by placing within the bottom six in the short program. He planned skate to the songs “El Tango de Roxanne” from \"Moulin Rouge!\" and “Tango de los Exilados” in the free skate program.\nChef de mission, Tom Carrasco remarked Martinez did his best given the skater's \"condition and circumstances\". According to the official, Zagor described Martinez' short program as \"not a bad performance\"."

        "title": "Lichens and nitrogen cycling",
        "text": "Some types of lichen are able to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere. This process relies on the presence of cyanobacteria as a partner species within the lichen. The ability to fix nitrogen enables lichen to live in nutrient-poor environments. Lichen can also extract nitrogen from the rocks on which they grow.\nNitrogen fixation, and hence the abundance of lichen and their host plants, may be decreased by application of nitrogen-based agricultural fertilizer and by atmospheric pollution.\nThe nitrogen cycle.\nThe nitrogen cycle is one of the Earth's biogeochemical cycles. It involves the conversion of nitrogen into different chemical forms. The main processes of the nitrogen cycle are the fixation, ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. As one of the macronutrients, nitrogen plays an important role in plant growth. The nitrogen cycle is affected by environmental factors. For example, in the subarctic heath, increase in temperature can cause nitrogen fixation to increase or decrease based on season, while overall climate warming indirectly caused the vegetation change which in turn affected the nitrogen fixation process.\nLichens.\nLichens are symbiotic organisms that play an important role in the biogeochemical cycle on Earth. The characteristics of lichens, such as strong resistance to factors such as desiccation, ability to grow and break down rocks allow lichen to grow in different types of environment including highly nitrogen limited area such as subarctic heath. While it does not occur often, formation of akinetes (type of cell formed by cyanobacteria which are resistant to cold and desiccation) was observed in nitrogen fixing lichen. Depending on its partner, lichens derive the carbon and nitrogen from algal and cyanobacteria photobionts (which fixes nitrogen from the air). Lichen fungi can fix nitrogen during the day and night, as long the dark period is not too long.\nNitrogen-fixing and non-nitrogen-fixing lichens.\nBoth nitrogen-fixing lichens and non-nitrogen-fixing lichens take up nitrogen from the environment as a nutrient. Both type of lichens secrete many different organic compounds to absorb minerals from the substrates.\nMain difference between nitrogen fixing lichen and non-nitrogen fixing lichen is their photosynthetic partner: nitrogen fixing lichen partner with cyanobacteria which can fix nitrogen from the air, while green alga, partner of non nitrogen fixing lichen, does not perform the same process. The nitrogen fixation is energetically costly due to chemical transformation and only about 10% of lichen are partnered with cyanobacteria. In agricultural regions, non nitrogen fixing lichen reflect uptake of ammonia emission indicating that it have lower nitrogen value.\nSome lichens such as Placopsis gelada contain both nitrogen fixing phototrophs and non nitrogen-fixing phototrophs in which Nostoc (cyanobacteria, the phototrophic nitrogen fixer) was dwelling within cephalodia (small gall like structure within lichen; contains cyanobacteria symbionts). In such cases, heterocyst differentiation was greater in cephalodia when compared to having Nostoc as the primary symbionts in lichens, showing that, in the presence of non nitrogen-fixing phototroph, Nostoc specialize for nitrogen fixation.\nInteraction with lichen.\nResponse to nitrogen and phosphorus.\nA lichen's response to nutrient enrichment depends on not only on species and environmental factors but also partially on thallus concentrations of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus.\nAmmonium, nitrate and organic nitrogen can be assimilated by lichen along with phosphorus as an important stimulant for cyanolichens. The photobiont will become less dependent on fungal nutrient supply when nitrogen deposition increases as it will be able to access its own nitrogen and it will stimulate the photobiont, causing it to build up, resulting in increased photosynthesis which increases carbon input. However, for lichens that cannot increase their photobiont growth, nitrogen deposition can be damaging due to higher nitrogen concentration than their biological requirements.\nGenerally, when a lichenized algal cell is nitrogen limited, the addition of nitrogen caused the growth of algal cells. Under nitrogen limiting condition, chlorophyll concentration was positively correlated with the growth of algal cells indicating that should the concentration of chlorophyll increase, the photobiont population will also increase. As lichens absorb nitrogen through fixation, it will have a very strong negative reaction if the nitrogen availability changes, indicating its sensitivity to environmental changes. According to the experiment by Sparrius et al., when nitrogen fertilizer was added into the soil, lichen cover was reduced by ~50%, while the addition of phosphorus showed opposite result. In the region such as boreal forest, where nitrogen and phosphorus are limiting nutrients and for symbiotic interaction to occur properly, their ratio must be balanced. General pollution of climate that is indicated by the concentration of nitrogen oxides can also affect the growth of lichen. When compared to bryophyte (non-vascular land plant), which is also sensitive to nitrogen fertilizer, lichen showed a much stronger response.\nNitrogen metabolism.\nThere are many different species of lichens and each has its own way of allocating nitrogen. The non nitrogen fixing lichen invests a large amount of nitrogen into photosynthetic tissue, whereas nitrogen fixing lichen will invest into the fungal tissue. Nitrogen-fixing lichen species can only attain a certain amount of nitrogen, as the addition of ammonium decreases its rate of nitrogen-fixation, which decreases the amount of nitrogen that is exported into the adjacent hyphae. Nitrogen fixation is energy dependent and very costly for lichens. In a region where nitrogen deposition is high, lichens have a lower uptake of nitrogen in comparison to the Antarctic green algal lichen, which takes up 90% of nitrogen deposition in both nitrate and ammonium form. Some lichen species are able to refrain from assimilating excessive amount of nitrogen in order to maintain a balanced tissue concentration. Majority of lichen species absorbs more NH4+ than NO3- and the impact of temperature on the rate of fixation is \"consonant to the normal enzymatic kinetics of them\".\nEffects of nitrogen fixation.\nNitrogen fixing lichens actively fix atmospheric nitrogen using the nostoc, located in the cephalodia. Lichens are sensitive to nitrogen availability. Upon nitrogen fixation, there will be an increase of algal cell growth, chlorophyll concentration, and photobiont population. While costly, in regions where nitrogen availability is low, fixation process is the main way for the lichen to absorb nitrogen which is macronutrient (essential nutrient).\nImportance.\nEcology.\nNitrogen, as a macronutrient and a biogeochemical cycle, also affects the ecology. Through the nitrogen cycle, it breaks down into the chemical form that allows plants to absorb as nutrients. There are certain regions in the world that most plants cannot live due to harsh environments as well as lack of nutrients such as nitrogen. That means that in some regions, the biogeochemical cycle (including nitrogen cycle and carbon cycle) is unlikely to run smoothly. Lichen is able to absorb nitrogen in multiple forms from soil, rock, and air, taking a part in carbon cycle at the same time. Even though only a small fraction of lichens have the ability to fix nitrogen, it helps the lichen to spread throughout the world and survive even in the harsh environment.\nThe industrial nitrogen fertilizer greatly affected the vegetation and agriculture throughout the world, resulting significantly increased the amount of food with better quality, but it has a negative impact on ecology in the long run. Deposition of nitrogen causes soil acidification, and the nitrogen in the fertilizer are often leached through soil and water, running off the different area. Soil acidification increases toxicity of the soil which reduces plant biodiversity and based on the toxic level of soil acidification, heavy metal such as aluminum and iron can be related to soil water.\nRock and soil.\nEarth's mantle contains non-atmospheric nitrogen in the form of rocks and in the soil. Weathering of the rocks and stone are normally caused by physical, chemical and biological processes. Plants cannot absorb nitrogen from rocks, but fungi can. Fungi within lichens can extract nutrients from mineral surfaces by secreting organic acids. The organic acids (e.g. phenolic acids) are important in solubilizing nutrients from inorganic substrates. A study was conducted to test rock phosphate solubilization by lichen-forming fungi. Bacteria that were attached to biotic or abiotic surfaces stimulate exopolysaccharide synthesis. While lichens have the ability to absorb nitrogen from rock, this only accounts for a small portion of the nitrogen cycle compared to the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen as it is more easily available.\nEffects on vegetation.\nPhotobionts will become less dependent on fungal nutrient supply when nitrogen deposition increases, as it will be able to access its own nitrogen, and primary producers' nutrient limit will also be reduced.\nNitrogen is one of the more limiting nutrients and the addition of nitrogen stimulates the photobiont, building up its cell, which subsequently increases its photosynthesis and its carbon input. Multiple nitrogen compounds can be assimilated by lichens, such as NH4+, NO3− and organic nitrogen compounds. Nitrogen deposition reduces the nutrient limitation of primary production. Increase in nitrogen deposition will allow the photobiont to access its own nitrogen which makes it less fungal dependent but only up to certain point.\nDepending on the environmental nitrogen availability, the addition of nitrogen can either increase and decrease the growth of the lichen. If the lichen cannot increase its photobiont growth, high nitrogen uptake may result in a higher concentration than it physiologically requires which will negatively affect the lichen and its host plant as the other nutrients are too limiting.\nLichen's response to nutrient enrichment is both species-specific and dependent on environmental factors such as nutrient concentration, light availability and water supply.\nNitrogen stress.\nLichen is nitrogen sensitive and change in nitrogen availability can affect its health greatly.\nTwo main nitrogen stress factors for lichens are nitrogen deficiency and high nitrogen deposition. Both types of nitrogen stress result in the reduction of the rate of thallus expansion in lichen. Nitrogen stressed lichen did not show a significant change in chitin:chlorophyll ratios, but ergosterol concentration showed significant increase indicating a higher demand on the respiratory system.\nAccording to an experiment, the ammonium toxicity due to nitrogen deposition reduced the vitality of lichen greatly at different regions such as inland dunes, boreal conditions, and subarctic heaths."

        "text": "Virtual Snooker is a sports simulation video game developed by Celeris and published by Interplay Productions as an entry in the \"Virtual Pool\" franchise, the second in the series after \"Virtual Pool\" and the first spin-off from pool games, focusing on the game of snooker. The game was released on DOS in July 1996 and is the first game in the series game to contain snooker as a playable game (the next was \"Virtual Pool Hall in 1999)\".\n\"Virtual Snooker\" was released the year after the original \"Virtual Pool\", and uses the same game engine many of the same digital assets as the previous installment. However, whilst \"Virtual Pool\" featured four different types of pool to play, \"Virtual Snooker\" only presents the ability to play traditional snooker, as the name suggests. Originally released only for DOS, it was later ported to Windows 95 and Windows 98 (in a single three-platform release), distributed by SoftKey.\nGameplay.\nSimilar to other releases in the \"Virtual Pool\" series, the game is controlled by keyboard and mouse, with shots being made by mouse movement. The game features first-person 3D graphics and allows the player to stand up away from the line of the shot, and move around the table to see different angles. The game boasts a higher frame rate than that of the original \"Virtual Pool\". In each release of the game, there is the ability to play locally networked multiplayer games on an Ethernet LAN, and to do basic online multiplayer between two remote computers via analog modems.\nThe game features LAN capabilities, and the ability to connect two computers via modem for basic online multiplayer. As with other games in the series, \"Virtual Snooker\" was marketed with a guarantee that the simulator would improve the player's non-simulated game at a real table. The game's box indicates six-time World Snooker Champion Steve Davis in a starring role. The game offers 52 minutes of instructional videos with Davis, and the option to pause the video and attempt the shot being demonstrated by the game. This live-action material also includes the world's first televised maximum break in history, completed by Davis.\nRonnie O'Sullivan, another top-level professional player, acts as presenter in the game (both he and Davis feature in the cover art, superimposed on snooker balls). O'Sullivan would later work on \"World Snooker Championship 2007\" and his own game, \"Ronnie O'Sullivan's Snooker\".\nReception.\nCritical Reception for \"Virtual Pool Hall\" was moderate, with review aggregator website Game Rankings scoring the game 67%. \"Stephen Pool\" of \"GameSpot\" scored the game at 7.2/10 saying \"how much you enjoy Virtual Snooker depends mainly on how much interest you have in real snooker.\". GameSpot cited the game for following on from \"Virtual Pool\", and \"you can expect the same excellence\" in terms of gameplay. They also stated that the inclusion of Steve Davis in game was an \"excellent job\", that \"show(ed) you the ideal way to play the game.\"\nGameSpot were less impressed with the lack of depth in gameplay modes; \"where Virtual Snooker disappoints is in its lack of variety.\" Where \"Virtual Pool\" had other types of Pool to play, Virtual Snooker only had Snooker. Other paper reviews, such as Germany's PC Joker, cited the game for its playability, as well as its looks, but also found the game did not have much replayability."

        "title": "2018 Overwatch League season",
        "text": "The 2018 Overwatch League season was the inaugural season for the Overwatch League, an esports league based on the video game \"Overwatch\" which began on January 10, 2018. Regular season play continued through June 16, 2018, while post-season play ran from July 11–28, 2018. The London Spitfire won the Grand Finals over the Philadelphia Fusion to become the League champions, with the Spitfire's Park \"Profit\" Jun-young named the Finals MVP. An All-Star Weekend was held following the post-season from August 25–26, 2018.\nSchedule.\nThe season's format and schedule were announced in November 2017. The inaugural regular season ran from January 10 to June 17, 2018, broken out into four stages. Each stage lasted five weeks, with a one-week break between each stages. Each regular season week featured twelve games, three matches per day from Wednesday to Saturday, with each team having played in two games that week. During stages one and two of season one, at the end of each stage, the top three teams across both divisions, based on their standings in that stage, played a final set of matches to win a prize with the runner-up taking a prize. As of season one stage three, four teams made each stage playoff. The #1 seed chose their opponent in the first round between the remaining three qualified teams. These matches are played on the final day of the stage.\nThe season's free agency signing window opened on January 22, 2018, and closed on April 3, 2018 (the start of Stage 3). During this period, teams could sign any eligible free agent player or make trades with other teams. Any player on a new team contract before the start of Stage 2 on February 21, 2018, was eligible to play during Stage 2. Otherwise, they had to wait until the start of Stage 3. After April 3, team rosters could not be changed until after the completion of the post-season games.\nThe post-season playoffs were held over three weeks in July 2018. It was a single-elimination playoff featuring 6 teams: each division leader, and the next top four teams from both divisions, with their position seeded by their standings. The Grand Finals were held on July 26 and 27, 2018.\nAll matches in the inaugural season (except for the Grand Finals) were played at the 350-seat Blizzard Arena, located on the former soundstage for \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" in Burbank, California. Games were broadcast on the Overwatch League's website and through Major League Gaming (owned by Blizzard), and by third-party broadcaster Twitch. The Grand Finals were played at Barclays Center in New York City, where all 11,000 seats available were sold out for both days of the event.\nPre-season.\nPre-season matches were held from December 6 to 8, 2017. Pre-season matches are exhibition only, and do not count towards the regular season standings. The Philadelphia Fusion had to pull out of pre-season play just before these events, citing \"player logistics issues\".\nBroadcast and viewership.\nThe Overwatch League began the season with a two-year exclusive contract for Overwatch League broadcasting. Its debut week held an overall peak of 441,000 concurrent viewers on its three Twitch channels, with 392,000 English, 65,000 Korean, and 11,500 French viewers. Through the season, average online viewership ran between 80,000 and 170,000. At least 310,000 viewers watched the final match of the Grand Finals.\nOn the first day of the season playoffs, Disney and Blizzard announced a multi-year partnership that would bring the league and other professional \"Overwatch\" competitive events to ESPN, Disney XD, and ABC, starting with the playoffs and throughout all of the following season. Nielsen ratings for the Grand Finals include a 0.18 rating (approximately 218,000 households) for the Friday match airing on ESPN, while the recap of the series airing on ABC on the Sunday after the event had a 0.3 rating (approximately 359,000 households). Blizzard estimated that over a million people were watching the Grand Finals at any time, between broadcast and streaming formats, with a total viewership of over 10.8 million.\nRegular season.\nA team's standing is based on both their overall match win–loss record, with ties broken by their overall round record.\nAt the end of Stages 1 and 2, the top three teams overall in the current stage, regardless of division, made the stage playoffs. The first seeded team earned a bye, with the second and third seeded teams playing a best-of-5 series to advance to the stage finals. Beginning with Stage 3 of the 2018 season, Blizzard announced changes to the Stage Playoff format. Introduced was a four-team Stage playoffs going forward, so that both teams in the final match will have played the same number of games on that day. The first seed has the option of selecting their opponent for the first round and has home team advantage, with the remaining two teams assigned based on seed ranking. These stage playoffs have no effect on overall standings and are only for bonus prize money.\nTeams' overall standings were used for placement in the post-season playoffs. The top team of each division received an automatic bye, while the next top four teams, regardless of division, filled in the remaining tournament slots.\nStage 1.\nStage 1 ran from January 10, 2018, to February 10, 2018, with Stage playoffs occurring on February 10, 2018.\nPlayoffs.\nWith a league best 9–1 stage record, the New York Excelsior earned a bye directly into the stage finals. In the semifinal match, the Houston Outlaws took an early 1–0 lead over the London Spitfire, but were ultimately defeated 3–1. In the stage final, the New York Excelsior took a commanding 2–0 lead over the Spitfire, but New York could not secure their third match win. The London Spitfire completed a reverse sweep, winning the series 3–2 and their first stage title.\nStage 2.\nStage 2 ran from February 21 to March 24. Following Stage 1, Blizzard took input from players and fans and moved all future Stage playoff matches to Sunday, with Stage 2's playoffs taking place on March 25. This avoided a twelve-hour day of matches, which could see a team playing as many as three different matches in the same day. Stage two introduced the \"Overwatch\" patch that weakened Mercy's resurrection abilities, which outside of League play had caused her to be played less frequently.\nPlayoffs.\nThe New York Excelsior finished with the best stage record again, earning another bye into the stage finals. The semifinal match featured the London Spitfire, looking to repeat on their Stage 1 championship, against the Philadelphia Fusion. The Fusion won the series, 3–2.\nIn the finals, the Fusion took 2–0 lead over the Excelsior, though New York came back and completed a reverse sweep to win the series and their first stage title.\nStage 3.\nStage 3 ran from April 4 to May 5, with the stage playoffs occurring on May 6. This stage introduced a four-team stage playoffs format so both teams in the final match will have played the same number of games on that day. The first seed was given the option of selecting their opponent for the first round and received home team advantage, with the remaining two teams assigned based on seed ranking. Stage 3 introduced the Hybrid map \"Blizzard World,\" which was released in November 2017, to the map pool. Stage 3 also introduced the patch that buffed Sombra's abilities, making her a more frequent component in winning team combinations.\nPlayoffs.\nFollowing the conclusion of Stage 3, the top seeded Boston Uprising became the first team in Overwatch League history to go undefeated in a stage. As the top seed, they earned the right to choose their first round opponent for the stage playoffs. They chose the fourth seed Los Angeles Gladiators, achieving a 3–0 match win. The second seed New York Excelsior also defeated the Los Angeles Valiant with a 3–0 win. The Excelsior won the final match over the Uprising in a 3–0 victory, marking their second stage championship win.\nStage 4.\nStage 4 ran from May 16 to June 16, with the Stage playoffs occurring on June 17. Teams competed using the version of \"Overwatch\" which first introduced the support hero Brigitte, but prior to a patch that adjusted her strength and which introduced a revamped skill kit for Hanzo. The decision to play on the former patch was made due to a bug in the later patch that could not be fixed before the start of Stage 4.\nPlayoffs.\nAfter the group stage, the Los Angeles Gladiators finished atop the league via a map differential tiebreaker. They earned the right to choose their opponent for the first round of the playoffs. For the first time in this selection process, the team with the best record did not choose the lowest ranked team. They choose their crosstown rivals, the second-seeded Los Angeles Valiant. The Valiant won the series in 5 maps. In the next series, the two-time stage champion New York Excelsior defeated the Dallas Fuel, 3–2. The Excelsior were unable to win their third consecutive stage championship, losing to the Valiant, 3–1.\nPlayoffs.\nAfter the regular season, the New York Excelsior and the Los Angeles Valiant finished atop their respective divisions, earning first-round byes. The next four remaining teams, Boston Uprising, Los Angeles Gladiators, London Spitfire, and Philadelphia Fusion, were seeded according to regular season record, regardless of division. The third-seeded Uprising played the sixth-seeded Fusion, while the fourth-seeded Gladiators played the fifth-seeded Spitfire. Each series was a best of 3 matches (each match was best of 5 maps). The winners of the two semifinal matches advanced to the Grand Finals, which took place at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York from July 27–28.\nAwards.\nFrom JJonak's MVP award, Blizzard created a special cosmetic skin for Zenyatta, the character that JJonak most frequently played, which was offered to viewers and players during the 2019 season.\nAll-Star Game.\nThe 2018 Overwatch League All-Star Game was the Overwatch League's first edition of an all-star game that involved the All-Star players of the league. The game was played on August 26, 2018, and was the culmination of the league's All-Star Weekend, a two-day event that consisted of Lúcioball, Mystery Heroes, a Widowmaker 1v1 tournament, Talent Takedown, and Lockout Elimination. All of the events were played at Blizzard Arena in Burbank, California. The game was televised by Disney XD and ESPN3 and streamed live on Twitch.\nWinnings.\nTeams in the first season competed for a total prize pool of across regular season play, stage finals, and playoffs. By league rules, at least 50% of these winnings were split among the team's members, the remaining going to the team's owner."

        "text": "The 2021 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey tournament was the national championship tournament for men's college ice hockey in the United States. It took place between March 26 and April 10, 2021. The tournament involved 16 teams in single-elimination play to determine the national champion at the Division I level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the highest level of competition in college hockey. The tournament's Frozen Four – the semifinals and finals – was hosted by Robert Morris University at the PPG Paints Arena in Pittsburgh from April 8 to 10.\nThe SNHU Arena in Manchester, New Hampshire, was selected to host the Northeast Region, but pulled out on January 26, 2021, due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. The Times Union Center in Albany, New York, was selected as a replacement site.\nThis year's tournament featured, as of 2024, the longest game in NCAA Division I men's ice hockey tournament history, when the Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs defeated the North Dakota Fighting Hawks by a score of 3–2 in five overtimes, totaling 142:13 minutes of play, in the West Regional Final.\nThis tournament's Frozen Four teams were also notable for a number of reasons. First, it was just the second time in NCAA Division I men's ice hockey tournament history in which three of the final four teams came from one state. This first occurred in 1992, when the Michigan Wolverines, Michigan State Spartans, and Lake Superior State Lakers, all from Michigan, made the Frozen Four. In this year’s tournament, three teams came from Minnesota, these teams being the Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs, St. Cloud State Huskies, and Minnesota State Mavericks. Also, this year's tournament was only the third time since 1992, when Regional Tournaments were first conducted, that no teams ranked no. 1 in their respective Regional Tournament advanced to the Frozen Four. This also occurred in the 1998 and 2007 tournaments.\nTournament procedure.\nThe tournament is composed of four groups of four teams in regional brackets. The four regionals are officially named after their geographic areas.\nRegional semifinals and finals\nNational semifinals and championship (Frozen Four and championship)\nQualifying teams.\nThe at-large bids and seeding for each team in the tournament were announced on March 21, 2021.\nTypically, teams are seeded according to their PairWise rankings (PWR); however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic causing a severe lack of inter-conference games among the league, using the PWR would not be a reliable representation of overall NCAA standings. As a result, the NCAA Selection Committee awarded seeds manually based on varying factors, including perceived strength of conference and performance against the best teams in conference. Once seeds were determined, matchups were adjusted to prevent teams from the same conference meeting in the first round, as well as minimize the amount of traveling required due to the pandemic.\nThe NCHC and Big Ten each had four teams receive a berth in the tournament, Hockey East and WCHA each had three teams receive a berth, and one team from Atlantic Hockey and the ECAC each received a berth.\nECAC Tournament champions St. Lawrence earned an autobid but were forced to withdraw from the tournament as a result of a positive COVID-19 test among the team's coaching staff. Quinnipiac was selected to replace St. Lawrence as ECAC's autobid.\nOn March 25, it was announced that Notre Dame would be forced to withdraw from the tournament due to COVID protocols. As a result, their matchup with Boston College was ruled a no-contest and the Eagles automatically advanced to the Northeast Regional Final. Similarly, on March 26, the NCAA announced Michigan was forced to withdraw as well due to COVID protocols. As a result, Minnesota–Duluth automatically advanced to the Midwest Regional Final.\nTournament bracket.\n&lt;br&gt;\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nESPN had US television rights to all games during the tournament for the sixteenth consecutive year. ESPN aired every game, beginning with the regionals, on ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNews, ESPNU, and ESPN3, which were streamed online via WatchESPN.\nBroadcast assignments.\n\"Regionals\"\n\"Frozen Four\"\nRadio.\nWestwood One had exclusive radio rights to the Frozen Four and broadcast both the semifinals and the championship."

The race was won by Georges Ronsse of Belgium.\nRace report.\nThe 192 kilometer race was held on dusty, unpaved and stony roads and in scorching heat. After 45 kilometers Jules Vanhevel attacked and only Georges Ronsse joined him. The others hesitated and the two Belgians were able to gain a lead of several minutes. The Italian favorites Costante Girardengo and defending champion Alfredo Binda were great rivals and did not want to ride for each other; eventually they would both give up. Gaetano Belloni sacrificed himself, but he was set back by tire failure, just like several other participants.\nAlong the way, Vanhevel fell after colliding with an ox team and injured himself in the fall. He was able to return to Ronsse, but when he attacked on a slope 70 km from the end, Vanhevel had to pass and give up. Ronsse was able to win with a lead of almost 20 minutes over the Germans Nebe and Wolke, which is still the largest lead with which a world championship has been won."

Pellegrin went to Peyongchang with her coach Marvin Hocquax. The Chef de Mission of the delegation was Lucienne Attard. As the only athlete, Pellegrin was chosen as the flag bearer for both the parade of nations during the opening ceremony, and the closing ceremony.\nAlpine skiing.\nMalta qualified one female athlete, Élise Pellegrin, she was 26 years old at the time of the Peyongchang Games.

That afternoon, she improved her time to 58.90 seconds, good enough for 50th place overall in the competition."

        "text": "Pakistan sent a delegation to contest at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, from February 9 to 25, 2018. This was Pakistan's third appearance at a Winter Olympic Games. The Pakistani delegation consisted of two athletes: alpine skier Muhammad Karim and cross-country skier Syed Human. As of the close of these Olympics, Pakistan has yet to win a Winter Olympics medal.\nBackground.\nThe first ski resort in Pakistan was opened in 1958, in the Naltar Valley. It was originally for air force pilots to train, but later opened up to civilians. The Ski Federation of Pakistan was founded in 1990. The 2010 Olympic Games was Pakistan's debut at the Winter Olympics. They first participated at the Summer Olympics in the 1948 Games, and won their first Summer Olympics medal in 1956. Karim was chosen as the flag bearer for the parade of nations during the opening ceremony, and the closing ceremony.\nAlpine skiing.\nPakistan qualified one male athlete for alpine skiing, Muhammad Karim. This was Karim's second Winter Olympics, his first was the 2014 Olympics in Sochi. He said he was not able to train much in Pakistan due to a lack of snow. In the giant slalom, he finished the first run in 1:27.53 and the second in 1:26.51, for a total time of 2:54.04. He placed 72nd overall, out of 119 competitors (34 athletes did not finish).\nKarim also competed in the slalom event, the first Pakistani to do so at the Olympics. During the race, Karim's skis passed on the wrong side of a gate and he was disqualified from the event. After the race he said, \"It's so embarrassing for me. I'm so sad about that. Such bad luck.\"\nCross-country skiing.\nPakistan qualified one male cross-country skier, Syed Human. This marked the country's debut in the sport at the Winter Olympics. Human is Kirim's nephew. He gave him advice on training and staying calm during the international competition.\nHuman is in the Pakistani army in addition to his participation on the national skiing team. The Ski Federation of Pakistan founded a school in his village, the same place Kirim is from. He began training internationally around 2010 and 2011. For these Olympics, Human spent time training in Turkey and Finland, and also traveled to Korea prior to the event. He competed in the men's 15 km freestyle cross-country race. Human finished with a time of 45:19.1, placing 108th in the competition."

The country returned to the Winter Olympics after last competing in 2010, which also marked its debut. The Colombian team consisted of three males and one female, competing in three different sports.\nCompetitors.\nThe following is the list of number of competitors participating in the Colombian delegation per sport.\nAlpine skiing.\nColombia qualified one male athlete, Michael Poettoz. Poettoz was born in Cali and was adopted by a French family when he was aged 21 months. Poettoz grew up and learned how to ski in Les Carroz d'Araches, France. Poettoz also represented the country at the Winter Youth Olympics in 2016 in Lillehammer, Norway. Poettoz's upbringing is similar to Madagascar's Mialitiana Clerc, who also qualified to compete at the 2018 Games.\nCross-country skiing.\nColombia qualified one male athlete, Sebastián Uprimny. Uprimny was born to Colombian parents in Paris, France. Colombia made its Winter Olympics debut in the sport.\nSpeed skating.\nColombia is one of the strongest nations in inline speed skating, as it was the overall champion since 2010 at the World Roller Speed Skating Championships. However the sport is not on the Olympic program. In 2015, the Colombian Federation of Inline Skating was approved by the International Skating Union to become a member in the (ice) speed skating branch, allowing the nation the possibility to qualify for the Winter Olympics. One Colombian male skater won a provisional quota spot in the men's 500 m and 1000 m event. Causil was the first speed skater from South America to compete at the Winter Olympics, also marking Colombia's debut in the sport. Colombia was later reallocated a spot for a female speed skater in the women's mass start. This was because of the reallocation of quotas from Russian athletes."

The Andorran Federation of Ice Sports, known in Catalan as the \"Federació Andorrana d'Esports de Gel\" (FAEG), was established in 1992 and later joined the IIHF on 4 May 1995. Despite not having a national team nor entering in any IIHF tournaments, Canillo was the host city of the 1997 IIHF World Championship Group D tournament, as well as the 2024 IIHF Women's World Championship Division II A tournament.\nHowever, it was only in 2017, when an official Andorra national team was organized. The national team made its debut at the 2017 IIHF Development Cup which was hosted in Canillo. Andorra played Portugal, Ireland, and Morocco. They lost all of their matches in the tournament, including a 5–3 defeat to Portugal in the bronze medal match. Andorra's first match was on 29 September 2017 against Portugal, the match ended in a 3–2 defeat in penalty shootout.\nIn 2022, Andorra applied to participate in the IIHF World Championships, though the Andorran federation noted that the country had difficulty fulfilling IIHF criteria, which include having 60 registered players and a domestic league."

        "text": "Greg Austin (born November 19, 1984) is an American football coach and former player. He is currently the assistant offensive line coach for the Jacksonville Jaguars. He was previously the offensive line coach at FIU, the University of Nebraska–Lincoln and the University of Central Florida. He also played offensive guard for the Nebraska Cornhuskers from 2003 to 2007.\nIn August 2018, Austin was nominated as part of ESPN's '40 Under 40.'\nEarly life.\nAustin was born on November 19, 1983, in Houston, Texas, at St. Luke's Hospital to Jacqueline L. Austin and Gregory D. Austin Sr. He attended Cy-Fair High School in Cypress, Texas, where he played football and a shot putter for the track and field team was elected homecoming king. While at Cy-Fair, his nickname was \"BG,\" or \"Big Greg \" due his popularity and leadership qualities among his teammates, peers, coaches and teachers. He eventually committed to a football scholarship at the University of Nebraska upon graduating in 2003. Other prospects included North Texas, Oklahoma State, Rice, SMU and Texas Tech.\nCollege career.\nUpon visiting Nebraska's campus in November 2002 and being heavily recruited by head coach Frank Solich, Austin signed a letter of intent to play for the Huskers in spring of 2003. He earned a spot that fall as a true starter on Solich's offensive line. He was the fifth true freshman in Nebraska's history to ever do so. His offensive teammates that year included Jammal Lord and his roommate Cory Ross. Despite a knee injury that sidelined him in the late season, the Cornhuskers went on to win the Alamo Bowl his first year against Michigan State. Austin retained his starting offensive line role throughout his tenure at Nebraska as they reclaimed victory two years later at the Alamo Bowl against Michigan. This time, it was under new head coach Bill Callahan. In his final year, the Huskers, including starting running back and roommate Brandon Jackson, fell in a close game to Auburn in the 2007 Cotton Bowl Classic. He graduated in 2007 from Nebraska with a Bachelors in Business Administration. Other teammates included Titus Adams, Joe Dailey, Sam Koch, Carl Nicks, Ndamukong Suh, Barrett Ruud, Zac Taylor, and Fabian Washington.\nShortly after graduating from Nebraska, under the tutelage of Richard Lapchick and Richard DeVos, Austin enrolled at the University of Central Florida where he studied under the DeVos Sports Management Program. Austin credited Lapchick and DeVos on matriculating to UCF by saying their societal contributions, \"really drew me in, and from there, I knew it was bigger than me.\" He graduated from UCF in 2009 with dual master's degrees in business sports management.\nCoaching career.\nEarly career.\nAustin's coaching career began shortly after graduating from UCF where he also worked as an event manager for Disney's Wide World of Sports. He took an intern graduate assistant coaching position at both Mesabi Range College and later Wayne State University. At both schools, he assisted with the offensive line as an intern coach.\nOregon.\nIn mid-2010, Austin received an offer to join Chip Kelly's coaching staff as a graduate assistant intern for the University of Oregon. Known by players and coaches alike as \"Coach G\", he helped coach the offensive line under the guidance of offensive coordinator Mark Helfrich. Although he started as a coaching intern in with Oregon, Austin was later promoted to, and remained, graduate assistant offensive coach the following year. When Austin came on board, the 2010 Ducks were 12-0 (8-0 Pac-10) in regular season play and went on to win the Pac-10 Conference title, the first undefeated and untied regular season in the school's 117-year football history. They went on to play against Heisman winner Cam Newton and the Auburn Tigers for the 2011 BCS National Championship in the Fiesta Bowl, but narrowly lost by a field goal towards the end of regulation. For the next two years, Austin and the Ducks would go on to retain the conference title in 2011, win the 2012 Rose Bowl and 2013 Fiesta Bowl with 12–2 (8–1 Pac-12) and 12–1 (8–1 Pac-12) records, respectively. This accumulates a 36-4 record while Austin was with the Ducks. During an Oregon News interview, Austin said, \"winning the Rose Bowl was one of the funnest moments I ever had on the field.\"\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nAustin left Oregon with Chip Kelly after the 2012 season to join the Philadelphia Eagles.\nCentral Florida and Nebraska.\nAustin joined new head coach Scott Frost's staff at the University of Central Florida (UCF) in 2016 as offensive line coach. When Frost departed after 2017 to become head coach at Nebraska, Austin followed him and took the same role there. Austin was one of four offensive assistants dismissed on November 8, 2021, in a major reshuffle of the offensive staff.\nFIU.\nOn January 2, 2022, it was reported that Austin would be joining Mike MacIntyre's inaugural FIU staff as the run game coordinator and offensive line coach.\nJacksonville Jaguars.\nOn February 1, 2023, it was reported the Austin would be returning to the NFL as the offensive assistant coach on Doug Peterson's Jacksonville Jaguars staff.\nOn February 22, 2024, Austin was named assistant offensive line coach for the Jaguars."

        "text": "Ryan Held (born November 23, 1974) is an American football coach. He is the head football coach for the University of Nebraska at Kearney, a position he has held since 2023. He was previously the running backs coach at University of Nebraska–Lincoln and was hired in that role in December 2017, after serving in that same position at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, Florida since 2016. Prior to that, he had served as the head coach at Peru State as well as several college and teams in Kansas and Oklahoma.\nEarly life and playing career.\nHeld was a two-time national champion himself as a Husker from 1993 to 1996. Nebraska posted a 47–3 record during Held’s career with three conference titles. At Nebraska, Held was a teammate of Scott Frost during the 1995 and 1996 seasons.\nCoaching career.\nFirst stint at Nebraska.\nAs a senior at Nebraska, Held coached the Huskers as a student assistant in 1997, helping them to a 13–0 record and a national title.\nTennessee.\nAs a defensive graduate assistant at Tennessee in 1998 and 1999, he was a part the Volunteers staff that won the 1998 national championship.\nPeru State.\nIn 2001, Held became the youngest head football coach in the country (age 26), and he led the Peru State Bobcats to a 5–5 record and a second-place league finish in his only season.\nOklahoma Pandhandle.\nIn 2002, Held took over an Oklahoma Panhandle State Aggies program that had only won two games in the previous three years. He led them to back-to-back winning seasons in 2003 and 2004.\nSW Oklahoma State.\nHeld led the Southwestern Oklahoma State program for four seasons, from 2005 to 2008, guiding the team to a share of the Lone Star Conference North Division title in 2007, one year after he was named the division coach of the year.\nButler Community College.\nIn 2011, Held was the offensive coordinator at Butler Community College where he led the team to an 11–1 record and finished as the #2 ranked offense in the country.\nHighland Community College.\nIn 2012, he took over a Highland Community College (Kansas) team that hadn't had a winning season since before 2000. In 2013, Highland made it to the playoffs for the first time in the modern era.\nNortheast Oklahoma A&amp;M.\nHeld was the head coach for two seasons at Northeastern Oklahoma A&amp;M College (2014–2015), where he coached 22 all-conference selections in his final season.\nUCF.\nHeld coached the running backs at UCF under head coach Scott Frost. He was part of a staff that led the nation’s most improved team in 2016 and posted the first perfect regular season in UCF and American Athletic Conference history in 2017. With help from Held’s running backs, the Knights’ offense showed dramatic improvement, increasing their scoring production by more than 35 points per game from 2015 to 2017 and their total offense output by more than 270 yards per game.\nHeld’s running backs helped UCF rush for nearly 2,500 yards during its undefeated regular season and run to the American Athletic Conference title in 2017. Adrian Killins Jr. averaged 6.8 yards per carry en route to earning all-conference accolades as a sophomore. Killins added 10 rushing touchdowns, including a 96-yard score in the regular-season matchup with Memphis, the longest rush and longest play from scrimmage in both UCF and AAC history. As a unit, Held’s running backs combined for 24 rushing touchdowns in 2017, including scores by six different backs. As a team, UCF ranked sixth nationally with 38 rushing touchdowns.\nIn Held’s first season at UCF in 2016, the Knights rushed for nearly 2,000 yards and three running backs, including more than 800 yards from freshmen. Killins averaged 6.5 yards per carry, while senior Dontravious Wilson scored eight rushing touchdowns after scoring only three times in his first three seasons combined.\nReturn to Nebraska.\nHeld returned to his alma mater, Nebraska, in December 2017, when he was one of the first hires on Scott Frost's Husker staff. He was one of four offensive assistants dismissed on November 8, 2021, in a major reshuffle of the offensive staff.\nNorth Alabama.\nIn 2022, Held joined the staff at North Alabama as the associate head coach, offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach."

        "text": "The Afghanistan cricket team toured India in June 2018 to play a one-off Test match against the India cricket team. It was Afghanistan's first Test since they were awarded the Test status by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in June 2017. India won the match in two days by an innings and 262 runs. Afghanistan were dismissed twice in the same day, only the fourth time this has happened in Tests. For India, it was their biggest win by an innings in Tests, and they became the first Asian team to win a Test match inside two days.\nAfter the match, India's captain Ajinkya Rahane said that playing more Tests and first-class cricket would improve the Afghan side. Phil Simmons, Afghanistan's coach, said that the team were \"by no means happy' with their performance\", but believed they would get there with further hard work.\nBackground.\nIn late 2017, it was announced that Zimbabwe would be Afghanistan's first Test opponents, but the tour was confirmed as being limited overs matches only. In December 2017, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) confirmed that the match would take place in 2018, with the exact date and venue to be announced at a later date. In January 2018, both the ACB and the BCCI confirmed the Test would be played in June at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. It was the first time a Test match was played in June in India.\nSquads.\nIndia's captain Virat Kohli announced that he would miss this Test match as he elected to play for Surrey County Cricket Club. This was in preparation for India's tour to England the following month. However, a neck injury ruled him out of playing for Surrey in England. Ajinkya Rahane was named as India's captain for the Test match in Kohli's absence.\nPrior to the final squad selection, Afghanistan had a team of thirty players warming up for the match in Greater Noida. On 29 May 2018, the ACB announced a sixteen-man squad for the Test match, with Asghar Stanikzai named as the captain. Afghan bowler Rashid Khan said that \"it will be a big day for cricket in Afghanistan\" and he could not wait to become a Test cricketer. He later added that the match will be \"a test of patience\" and that he might end up taking no wickets.\nAhead of the Test, Wriddhiman Saha was ruled out of India's squad due to injury, and was replaced by Dinesh Karthik. Mohammed Shami was also ruled out of India's squad after failing a fitness test, being replaced by Navdeep Saini.\nBefore the Test, both captains commented on the significance of the fixture. Asghar Stanikzai, Afghanistan's captain, said that \"to be playing our first Test against India is a great honour and we hope to give a good account of ourselves\". India's captain, Ajinkya Rahane, said \"it's a privilege to be playing in Afghanistan's first Test match\" adding that it will be an historic moment for the Afghan team."

        "text": "The England cricket team toured Sri Lanka in October and November 2018 to play three Tests, five One Day Internationals (ODIs) and one Twenty20 International (T20I) match. The tour included England's first Test matches in Sri Lanka since 2012.\nIn September 2018, Sri Lanka Cricket named Dinesh Chandimal as the captain of the ODI team, replacing Angelo Mathews. Days later, Mathews was dropped from Sri Lanka's ODI side due to fitness concerns. However, Mathews was named in Sri Lanka's Test squad, which was named at the same time as the ODI squad.\nEngland won the ODI series 3–1, after the first match finished in a no result. Despite all five ODIs being affected by rain, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) defended the decision to play the series during Sri Lanka's monsoon season, saying that they had \"very little wriggle room\" with regards to the dates. England won the one-off T20I match by 30 runs.\nIn October 2018, Sri Lankan bowler Rangana Herath announced that he would retire from international cricket following the first Test in Galle. In the first innings of the match, he became the third bowler to take 100 Test wickets at the same venue, when he dismissed the England captain Joe Root. After the match, Herath said that it was \"the right time\" to retire, finishing his career with 433 Test wickets, the most for a left-arm spin bowler. Sri Lanka's Test captain, Dinesh Chandimal, was ruled out of the rest of the series after suffering an injury in the first Test, with Suranga Lakmal named as his replacement as captain for the remaining two Tests.\nEngland won the first two Test matches, therefore giving them an unassailable lead, and their first series win in Sri Lanka since 2001. England went on to win the third Test by 42 runs, therefore winning the series 3–0. It was the first time that England had won every Test of a three-match series in Sri Lanka. It was also England's first clean sweep in an overseas series of three or more Tests since beating New Zealand in 1963. The Test series saw 100 wickets taken by spin bowling, a record for a three-match series.\nSquads.\nLiam Plunkett was included in the England ODI squad, but missed the first three matches due to his wedding. Prior to the third ODI, Liam Dawson was ruled out of the series with a side strain, and replaced by Joe Denly. Jonny Bairstow suffered an injury in training ahead of the fourth ODI and was ruled out of the remaining limited-over matches. Chris Jordan was added to the England squad for the one-off T20I. Ben Foakes was added to England's Test squad as cover for Jonny Bairstow. Bairstow's injury also ruled him out of the first Test. Ahead of the second Test, Ollie Pope was released from England's squad, to allow him to play with the England Lions.\nKusal Mendis was added to Sri Lanka's squad, replacing Kusal Perera who suffered an injury during the second ODI match. Kusal Perera was then ruled out of the one-off T20I, with Sadeera Samarawickrama added to Sri Lanka's squad for the match. Ahead of the Test series, Lahiru Kumara was removed from Sri Lanka's squad for disciplinary reasons, and was replaced by Dushmantha Chameera. Ahead of the second Test, Charith Asalanka was added to Sri Lanka's squad. For the third Test, Nishan Peiris replaced Akila Dananjaya in Sri Lanka's squad. Dananjaya was reported for a suspect bowling action during the first Test. Danushka Gunathilaka was added to Sri Lanka's squad for the third Test, with Asalanka being released."

        "text": "The 2018–19 international cricket season was from September 2018 to April 2019. 34 Test matches, 92 One Day Internationals (ODIs) and 74 Twenty20 International (T20Is), as well as 28 Women's One Day Internationals (WODIs) and 130 Women's Twenty20 Internationals (WT20Is), were played during this period. The season started with India leading the Test cricket rankings, England leading the ODI rankings and Pakistan leading the Twenty20 rankings. In October 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) introduced separate rankings for women's ODIs and T20Is for the first time, with Australia women leading both tables.\nAll men's Twenty20 matches played between member sides after 1 January 2019 were given full international status and classified as T20Is, as per a decision made by the ICC in April 2018 (the same had applied to women's Twenty20 matches since 1 July 2018). The first men's T20Is to be classified as such under these new rules took place at the 2019 ACC Western Region T20.\nMen's international cricket started off with the 2018 Asia Cup Qualifier, which saw Hong Kong qualify for the 2018 Asia Cup. The Asia Cup started nine days later and was won by India, who beat Bangladesh in the final. Other highlights included New Zealand beating Pakistan in an away Test series for the first time in 49 years, India winning a Test series against Australia in Australia for the first time ever, and Sri Lanka becoming the first side from Asia to win a Test series against South Africa in South Africa. The last Test match of Bangladesh's tour of New Zealand was cancelled due to the Christchurch mosque shootings. In March 2019, Afghanistan won their first Test match, beating Ireland by seven wickets in their one-off Test in India.\nOn 20 October, the ICC announced a major revamp to the 2023 Cricket World Cup qualification process. Following the conclusion of the Division Three and Division Two tournaments, the World Cricket League (WCL) was scrapped and the new qualification pathway consisted of the following tournaments: CWC Super League (comprising the 12 Full Members and the Netherlands), CWC League 2 (comprising Scotland, Nepal, the United Arab Emirates, and the top four finishers the Division Two tournament), CWC Challenge League (the next best 12 nations based on final rankings in the WCL), CWC Play-Off, and the CWC Qualifier. The 2018 ICC World Cricket League Division Three tournament, which was held in Oman, saw Oman and the United States promoted to Division Two, while Singapore, Kenya, Denmark and Uganda were placed in the CWC Challenge League. The Division Two tournament, was held in Namibia in April. Oman, Namibia, the United States and Papua New Guinea all finished in the top four places, and gained ODI status in the process.\nThe qualification process for the 2020 ICC T20 World Cup started during the season. The East Asia-Pacific (EAP) Group B Subregional Qualifier, held in the Philippines, saw the Philippines qualify for the EAP Regional Qualifier. The Asia Eastern Sub Region Qualifier, held in Malaysia, saw Nepal, Singapore, and Malaysia qualify for the Asia Region Qualifier. The Africa Southern Sub Region Qualifier, held in Botswana, saw Botswana and Namibia qualify for the Africa Region Qualifier. The Americas Northern Sub Region Qualifier, held in the United States, saw Canada and the United States qualify for the America Region Qualifier. Papua New Guinea won the Regional Final of the EAP Qualifier to become the first team to qualify for the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier tournament.\nWomen's international cricket started off with India's tour of Sri Lanka. The highlight of women's cricket for the 2018–19 season was the Women's World Twenty20, which was won by Australia. The 2019 ICC Women's Qualifier Asia saw Thailand qualify for both the 2019 ICC Women's World Twenty20 Qualifier and 2020 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier.\nRankings.\nThe following were the rankings at the beginning of the season.\nFebruary.\nBangladesh in New Zealand.\nThe third and final Test match of the tour was cancelled due to the Christchurch mosque shootings.\nMarch.\nZimbabwe in India.\nZimbabwe were scheduled to tour India to play one Test and three ODI matches. However, the dates clashed with the 2019 Indian Premier League, and the series was postponed."

Initially, the Test match at the Adelaide Oval was planned to be a day/night fixture, but the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) declined the offer from Cricket Australia to play the match under lights. In April 2018, the Western Australian Cricket Association confirmed that the Perth Stadium would host its first ever Test match. During the second Test, it became the tenth venue in Australia to host a Test match.\nIndia's regular wicket-keeper for limited overs matches, MS Dhoni, was not named in the side's squad for the T20I fixtures for this series and the ones against the West Indies. Instead, India's Test wicket-keeper, Rishabh Pant, was selected in Dhoni's place. The T20I series was drawn 1–1, after the second match finished in a no result. India won the Test series 2–1, after the fourth match of the series finished as a draw. India became the first Asian team to win a Test series in Australia.\nIn the ODI series that followed, Australia won the first match by 34 runs, recording their 1,000th win in international cricket. However, India went on to win the next two games, and consequently the series 2–1; in the process recording their first bilateral ODI series victory in Australia.\nSquads.\nMitchell Starc was added to Australia's T20I squad for the third match, replacing Billy Stanlake, who was injured. Prithvi Shaw was ruled out of India's Test squad due to injury and was replaced by Mayank Agarwal. Hardik Pandya was also added to India's squad for the last two Test matches. Marnus Labuschagne was added to Australia's squad for the fourth Test. Jasprit Bumrah was rested for the ODI series and was replaced by Mohammed Siraj in India's squad. Mitchell Marsh was ruled out of Australia's squad for the first ODI due to illness and was replaced by Ashton Turner.\nOn 11 January 2019, Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul were suspended by the BCCI following controversial comments they made on the Indian talk show \"Koffee with Karan\" earlier in the month. They were ruled out of the ODI series of this tour, and all of the fixtures of India's tour to New Zealand. Vijay Shankar was added to India's ODI squad as a replacement.\nTest series.\nEntering the series, India held the Border–Gavaskar Trophy after winning the 2017 series 2–1. Australia won the previous series at home 2–0 in 2014–15.\nIn popular culture.\nAn Australian docu-series - The Test was produced, following the Australian national cricket team in the aftermath of the Australian ball tampering scandal. The third and fourth episodes of Season 1 featured Australia playing the 4 tests against India."

        "text": "The West Indies cricket team toured India from September to November 2018 to play two Tests, five One Day Internationals (ODIs) and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. Ahead of the Test series, there was a two-day practice match in Vadodara.\nJason Holder was ruled out of the first Test due to an injury, with Kraigg Brathwaite captaining the West Indies in his place. India won the match, their 100th win in Tests at home. India went on to win the second Test by 10 wickets, winning the series 2–0. It was India's tenth consecutive series win at home in Tests.\nThe second ODI was the 950th ODI to be played by India, becoming first team to achieve the milestone. During the match, India's captain Virat Kohli became the fastest batsman to score 10,000 runs in ODIs, taking 205 innings, beating the previous record of 259 innings set by Sachin Tendulkar. India went on to win the five-match ODI series 3–1, after the second ODI ended in a tie.\nIndia's regular wicket-keeper for limited overs matches, MS Dhoni, was not named in the side's squad for the T20I fixtures for this series and the ones against Australia. Instead, India's Test wicket-keeper, Rishabh Pant, was selected in Dhoni's place. Rohit Sharma was also named as India's captain for the T20I matches against the West Indies, with Virat Kohli being rested. India won the T20I series 3–0.\nBackground.\nOriginally, one of the ODI matches had been allocated to the Greenfield International Stadium in Thiruvananthapuram, per the Board of Control for Cricket in India's (BCCI) Tours and Fixtures Committee. However, when the fixtures were announced in March 2018, the match was allocated to the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Kochi instead. The Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) requested that the BCCI reviews the decision. Two days later, the BCCI announced the fixture would be played in Thiruvananthapuram.\nIn September 2018, it was confirmed that the Ekana International Cricket Stadium in Lucknow would host its first ever international match. The last time Lucknow hosted an international match was in January 1994, when India played a Test match against Sri Lanka at the K. D. Singh Babu Stadium. Later the same month, it was reported that the second ODI match may be moved from the Holkar Stadium in Indore, due to a row about complimentary-ticket allocations. On 3 October 2018, the BCCI confirmed that the second ODI would be moved to the Dr. Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA–VDCA Cricket Stadium, in Visakhapatnam. On 12 October 2018, the BCCI moved the fourth ODI from the Wankhede Stadium to Brabourne Stadium due to administrative issues. On the day before the second T20I, the Ekana Stadium was renamed in honour of Atal Bihari Vajpayee.\nSquads.\nBefore the start of the tour, Alzarri Joseph was ruled out of the West Indies' Test squad and was replaced by Shermon Lewis. Evin Lewis withdrew from the West Indies' limited-overs squads due to personal reasons. Kieran Powell and Nicholas Pooran replaced him in the ODI and T20I squads respectively. Ashley Nurse suffered an injury during the fourth ODI, and was ruled out of the next ODI match and the T20I series. Andre Russell was ruled out of the West Indies' T20I squad due to injury, and Shai Hope was added to the squad.\nShardul Thakur was ruled out of India's ODI squad and was replaced by Umesh Yadav. Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah were added to India's ODI squad for the last three matches of the series, with Mohammed Shami being dropped. Kedar Jadhav was added to India's ODI squad for the fourth and fifth ODIs. Jasprit Bumrah, Kuldeep Yadav and Umesh Yadav were rested for the third T20I and Siddarth Kaul was added India's T20I squad."

Shoaib Malik was named as the captain for the fourth and fifth ODIs and the T20I series. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) were disappointed with the ICC's decision to suspend Sarfraz, after Sarfraz apologised in person to Phehlukwayo before the start of the third ODI.

        "text": "The 2018 SummerSlam was the 31st annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw, SmackDown, and 205 Live brand divisions. The event took place on August 19, 2018, at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York for the fourth and final consecutive year.\nThirteen matches were contested at the event, including three on the Kickoff pre-show. Nine matches, including two on the Kickoff pre-show, were championship matches. In the main event, Roman Reigns defeated Brock Lesnar to win Raw's Universal Championship, ending Lesnar's 504-day reign (although WWE officially recognizes it as 503 days). In the penultimate match, Ronda Rousey defeated Alexa Bliss to win the Raw Women's Championship, becoming the first woman to win a women's championship in both the Ultimate Fighting Championship and WWE. In other prominent matches, The Miz defeated Daniel Bryan, Samoa Joe defeated SmackDown's WWE Champion AJ Styles by disqualification (thus did not win the championship), and in the opening bout, Seth Rollins defeated Dolph Ziggler to regain Raw's Intercontinental Championship. The event was also the first SummerSlam not to feature John Cena since 2003.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual professional wrestling event produced every August by WWE since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views (PPV), along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. Announced on August 14, 2017, the 2018 event was the 31st SummerSlam and was scheduled to be held on August 19, 2018, at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York for the fourth consecutive year. It featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown, and 205 Live brand divisions. The event aired on pay-per-view worldwide and was livestreamed on the WWE Network. Tickets went on sale on February 2 through Ticketmaster.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised 13 matches, including three on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw, SmackDown, and 205 Live brands, with storylines produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\", \"SmackDown Live\", and the cruiserweight-exclusive \"205 Live\".\nRaw.\nAs Universal Champion Brock Lesnar refused to defend the title at Extreme Rules, Raw General Manager Kurt Angle gave him an ultimatum: defend the title or be stripped of it. On the \"Raw\" after Extreme Rules, Lesnar's advocate Paul Heyman agreed that Lesnar would defend the title at SummerSlam. Bobby Lashley, Drew McIntyre, Seth Rollins, Elias, Finn Bálor, and Roman Reigns all wanted an opportunity. In response, Angle scheduled two triple threat matches that night, with the winners facing each other the following week to determine Lesnar's challenger. Reigns won the first triple threat match over Bálor and McIntyre, while Lashley won the second over Elias and Rollins. The following week, Reigns defeated Lashley. Lesnar and Heyman then faked a break up before ambushing Reigns on the final \"Raw\" before SummerSlam.\nAfter retaining her title against Nia Jax at Extreme Rules in an Extreme Rules match, Raw Women's Champion Alexa Bliss gloated that she had beaten every woman on the Raw roster. Ronda Rousey, whom she had cost a championship match at Money in the Bank and who had been suspended, came out from the crowd and attacked Bliss and Mickie James. Raw General Manager Kurt Angle extended Rousey's suspension for another week, and also awarded her a title match at SummerSlam, provided that she would not break her suspension again.\nAt Extreme Rules, Kevin Owens defeated Braun Strowman in a Steel Cage match after Strowman threw Owens from the top of the cage onto the broadcast table. On the July 23 episode of \"Raw\", Owens vowed to take everything away from Strowman. A rematch was scheduled for SummerSlam with a stipulation that if Owens won, even by disqualification or countout, he would win Strowman's Money in the Bank contract.\nAt Extreme Rules, Dolph Ziggler defeated Seth Rollins 5–4 in sudden death overtime of a 30-minute Iron Man match to retain the Intercontinental Championship, thanks to interference from Ziggler's tag team partner, Drew McIntyre. On the July 23 episode of \"Raw\", a rematch between Ziggler and Rollins for the title was scheduled for SummerSlam with McIntyre in Ziggler's corner. During the contract signing on the August 13 episode, Dean Ambrose returned from injury, confirming he would be in Rollins' corner.\nAt Extreme Rules, Finn Bálor defeated Baron Corbin. A few weeks later, a rematch between the two was scheduled, with Corbin defeating Bálor. The following week, another match between the two was scheduled for SummerSlam.\nOn the August 13 episode of \"Raw\", The B-Team (Bo Dallas and Curtis Axel) retained the Raw Tag Team Championship in a triple threat tag team match against Matt Hardy and Bray Wyatt and The Revival (Dash Wilder and Scott Dawson) when they pinned Wyatt. Afterwards, The B-Team was scheduled to defend the championship against The Revival on the SummerSlam Kickoff pre-show.\nSmackDown.\nOn the July 24 episode of \"SmackDown\", SmackDown General Manager Paige was about to reveal AJ Styles's opponent for the WWE Championship at SummerSlam when James Ellsworth tried to claim the contendership. Paige fired him and saw him being kicked out of the building, when Samoa Joe attacked Styles with the \"Coquina Clutch\" and then signed the contract.\nOn July 21, Paige scheduled a tag team title tournament with the winning team earning the right to challenge The Bludgeon Brothers (Harper and Rowan) for the SmackDown Tag Team Championship at SummerSlam. The tournament began on the July 24 episode of \"SmackDown\" with The New Day (represented by Big E and Xavier Woods) and Cesaro and Sheamus advancing to the finals by defeating SAnitY (Alexander Wolfe and Killian Dain) and The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), respectively. The New Day (represented by Big E and Kingston) then defeated Cesaro and Sheamus in the finals to face The Bludgeon Brothers for the titles at SummerSlam.\nOn the July 24 episode of \"SmackDown\", Becky Lynch defeated SmackDown Women's Champion Carmella in a non-title match to earn the right to challenge for the title at SummerSlam. The following week, Charlotte Flair returned and saved Lynch from an attack by Carmella. The same night, Flair defeated Carmella and was subsequently added to the title match, making it a triple threat match.\nAt Extreme Rules, Shinsuke Nakamura defeated Jeff Hardy to capture the United States Championship after a pre-match low blow. A rematch between the two for the title was scheduled for the following \"SmackDown\" which Hardy won by disqualification after he was attacked by Randy Orton. On August 3, another match between the two for the title was scheduled for SummerSlam.\nIn the first season of \"NXT\" in 2010, The Miz served as the \"WWE Pro\" of \"NXT Rookie\" Daniel Bryan. Throughout the season, Miz constantly berated Bryan, claiming he was not WWE material and expressing his displeasure at Bryan being his Rookie. The feeling was mutual as Bryan regularly alluded to the fact that he had been wrestling longer than Miz, stating that he should be the Pro and Miz should be the Rookie. On the May 11 episode of \"NXT\", Bryan was eliminated from the show. The following week after his elimination, Bryan attacked The Miz and Michael Cole on \"NXT\". The two would then feud over the United States Championship, which Bryan won from Miz at Night of Champions. Six years later, on the August 23, 2016, episode of \"Talking Smack\", Bryan (then General Manager of SmackDown) got into a verbal altercation with The Miz, which consisted of Bryan criticizing Miz's wrestling ability and \"safe style\" of wrestling. The Miz responded by going on a rant about Bryan being unable to return to in-ring competition due to the various injuries he had sustained throughout his WWE career. From this point forward, Bryan and Miz had sporadic interactions for over a year. On March 20, 2018, Bryan was medically cleared to return to in-ring competition by doctors, after which he resumed his feud with The Miz. On the July 31 episode of \"SmackDown\", Bryan challenged Miz to a match at SummerSlam. Miz initially declined the match, stating that he has always been above Bryan going back to \"NXT\" season one, and recommended that Bryan return to the independent circuit once his WWE contract expired. However, the following week, The Miz accepted Bryan's SummerSlam challenge.\nOn the July 24 episode of \"SmackDown\", Andrade \"Cien\" Almas defeated Rusev. The following week, Zelina Vega defeated Lana. A rematch between Vega and Lana was scheduled the following week, with Vega winning again. On August 11, a mixed tag team match between Rusev and Lana and Almas and Vega was scheduled for SummerSlam Kickoff pre-show.\n205 Live.\nOn the July 24 episode of \"205 Live\", Drew Gulak earned the right to challenge Cedric Alexander for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship by winning a fatal four-way match. On July 30, the match between Alexander and Gulak for the title was scheduled for SummerSlam. Brian Kendrick and Gentleman Jack Gallagher were banned from ringside for the match.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nThree matches occurred on the SummerSlam Kickoff pre-show. In the first match, Andrade \"Cien\" Almas and Zelina Vega faced Rusev and Lana. In the climax, Vega pinned Lana with a roll-up using the ring ropes as leverage to win the match. \nNext, Cedric Alexander defended the WWE Cruiserweight Championship against Drew Gulak. In the end, Alexander pinned Gulak with a roll-up to retain the title.\nAfter that, The B-Team (Bo Dallas and Curtis Axel) defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against The Revival (Scott Dawson and Dash Wilder). In the end, as Dawson attempted to pin Axel with a small package, Dallas fell onto Axel, reversing the small package and pinning Dawson to retain the titles.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with Dolph Ziggler (accompanied by Drew McIntyre) defending the Intercontinental Championship against Seth Rollins, accompanied by Dean Ambrose. McIntyre sent Ambrose into the steel steps at ringside, distracting Rollins and allowing Ziggler to perform a \"Zig Zag\" on Rollins for a nearfall. In the end, as McIntyre attempted to interfere, Ambrose performed \"Dirty Deeds\" on McIntyre. Rollins performed a superkick and \"The Stomp\" on Ziggler to regain the title for a second time.\nNext, The Bludgeon Brothers (Harper and Rowan) defended the SmackDown Tag Team Championship against The New Day's Big E and Xavier Woods, accompanied by Kofi Kingston. The match ended when Rowan struck Woods and Big E with a mallet, thus The New Day won by disqualification, however, The Bludgeon Brothers retained the titles. \nAfter that, Braun Strowman defended his Money in the Bank contract against Kevin Owens, with the stipulation that Strowman could lose the contract by any means. In the end, Strowman chokeslammed Owens onto the steel stage ramp. Strowman then rolled Owens back into the ring and performed a running powerslam on Owens to retain the contract and end the feud. \nIn the fourth match, Carmella defended the SmackDown Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair and Becky Lynch. The ending saw Lynch apply the \"Dis-Arm-Her\" on Carmella, only for Flair to sneak behind &amp; attack Lynch from behind with the \"Natural Selection\" for the pinfall to win the title to tie Trish Stratus' record, winning her seventh women's championship. After the match, Lynch attacked Flair, turning heel. \nNext, AJ Styles defended the WWE Championship against Samoa Joe. In the climax, as Joe continued to taunt Styles' wife and child, who were in attendance at ringside, an irate Styles tackled Joe through the barricade. Styles then attacked security personnel and struck Joe with a chair, causing a disqualification, thus Joe won the match, however, Styles retained the title. \nNext, Elias promised a concert. As he was about to start, the guitar broke. He then discarded the guitar pieces and then departed backstage.\nNext, Daniel Bryan faced The Miz. In the end, Miz's wife Maryse, who was seated in the front row, handed Miz a pair of brass knuckles that the referee did not see. As Bryan attempted a suicide dive, Miz struck Bryan with the object and tossed the object back to Maryse. Afterwards, Miz rolled Bryan back in the ring and pinned him to win the match. \nAfter that, \"The Demon\" Finn Bálor faced Baron Corbin. Bálor performed a clothesline on Corbin sending him over the top rope. Bálor performed a Sling Blade followed by a dropkick on Corbin. In the climax, Bálor performed a \"Coup de Grâce\" on Corbin to win the match. \nLater, Shinsuke Nakamura defended the United States Championship against Jeff Hardy. In the end, Hardy attempted a \"Swanton Bomb\" on the ring apron onto Nakamura, but Nakamura moved, causing Hardy to land on the edge of the ring canvas. Nakamura then got Hardy back in the ring and performed a \"Kinshasa\" to retain the title. After the match, Randy Orton appeared, teasing an attack on Hardy, but left immediately afterwards. \nIn the penultimate match, Alexa Bliss defended the Raw Women's Championship against \"Rowdy\" Ronda Rousey. Natalya made her entrance first to be in Rousey's corner, and she wore her father Jim Neidhart's jacket to the ring, who had died a few days prior. Rousey dominated the entire match while Bliss mounted almost no offense at all. At the start, Bliss backed into the ropes twice and the referee forced Rousey to step back to the middle of the ring. Bliss left the ring twice but avoided a countout at a 5-count both times. After returning to the ring, Bliss applied a sleeper hold, but Rousey escaped and performed Piper's Pit to Bliss. Bliss then rolled out of the ring, leaving it for a third time, until Rousey chased her back in, avoiding another countout at a 6-count. Afterwards, Rousey blocked a right hand before performing another Piper's Pit. Finally, Rousey forced Bliss to submit to an armbar to win the title, becoming the first woman to win a championship in both the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and WWE, as well as the second person overall after Brock Lesnar. After the match, Rousey celebrated with Natalya and The Bella Twins (Nikki Bella and Brie Bella) Ronda Rousey also became the first women in UFC to debut in a WWE ring.\nMain event.\nIn the main event, Brock Lesnar (with Paul Heyman) defended the WWE Universal Championship against Roman Reigns. Before the match began, Braun Strowman showed up, stating his intention to cash in his Money in the Bank contract on the winner and remaining at ringside. As soon as the match began, Reigns surprised Lesnar with three Superman Punches and three Spears. Lesnar performed a Guillotine Choke twice, but Reigns reversed it into a Spinebuster twice. Lesnar avoided a fourth Superman Punch and performed three German Suplexes on Reigns. As Lesnar attempted an F-5, Reigns reversed it into a fourth Spear attempt, but Lesnar avoided it and Reigns performed a Suicide Dive on Strowman at ringside by accident. There, Lesnar performed an F-5 on Strowman. Lesnar attacked Strowman with the Money in the Bank briefcase, throwing it to the entrance stage. In the climax, Lesnar attacked Strowman with a chair, preventing the cashing in after the match, but Reigns took advantage of the distraction and performed a fourth Spear for a pinfall (because while Lesnar returned to the ring with the chair to attack Reigns and get a DQ, Lesnar was still looking at Strowman), winning his first WWE Universal Championship and ending Lesnar's reign at 504 days.\nAftermath.\nRaw.\nOn the following episode of \"Raw\", new Universal Champion Roman Reigns made an open challenge, but announced that he specifically wanted to face Finn Bálor, as he was the inaugural champion who had to relinquish the title due to injury, but never received a rematch. Bálor accepted and Reigns retained the title. After the match, Braun Strowman attacked Reigns and attempted to cash in his Money in the Bank contract, but was intercepted by Reigns' colleagues from The Shield (Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose). The Shield performed their signature triple powerbomb on Strowman through an announce table. Also that episode, Paul Heyman confronted General Manager Kurt Angle about Brock Lesnar's contractual rematch, wanting it to occur at Hell in a Cell. Angle said that it was himself who decided about the time of the rematch and that Lesnar would not receive his rematch for a long time. According to Ambrose, the original plan was to reunite the Shield at SummerSlam, attacking Lesnar and helping Reigns to win the title, but Lesnar asked Vince McMahon to change the storyline. The following week, Strowman confronted Reigns and announced that he would be cashing-in at Hell in a Cell inside the namesake structure so that Ambrose and Rollins could not interfere. WWE Hall of Famer Mick Foley would later be named the special guest referee for the match. Also on the August 27 episode, Reigns teamed with Strowman to take on Ziggler and McIntyre. After Strowman tagged in, McIntyre and Ziggler attacked Reigns, and Strowman joined the beatdown. Rollins and Ambrose tried to help Reigns, but were overpowered, as well. This would also lead to a six-man tag team match pitting The Shield against Strowman, McIntyre, and Ziggler at Super Show-Down. At Hell in a Cell, Reigns and Strowman's match ended in a no-contest after interference from Lesnar. This would set up a triple threat match between Reigns, Lesnar, and Strowman for the Universal Championship at Crown Jewel.\nDean Ambrose with new Intercontinental Champion Seth Rollins also had a match against Dolph Ziggler. Rollins took out McIntyre, allowing Ambrose to defeat Ziggler.\nA championship celebration with all of the women of Raw and Raw Commissioner Stephanie McMahon occurred for new Raw Women's Champion Ronda Rousey. Stephanie tried to take credit for Rousey being in WWE and subsequently becoming champion, but Rousey said her win was for all women, not for herself or for Stephanie. Rousey then applied the armbar to Stephanie. The following week, Alexa Bliss invoked her championship rematch clause for Hell in a Cell.\nRaw Tag Team Champions The B-Team (Curtis Axel and Bo Dallas) took on The Revival (Scott Dawson and Dash Wilder) in back-to-back singles matches, where Dawson defeated Dallas and Wilder defeated Axel. The following week, The Revival defeated The B-Team. A title match between the two teams was scheduled for the September 3 episode, but The B-Team were attacked backstage by Dolph Ziggler and Drew McIntyre, who went on to become the new champions.\nSmackDown.\nWWE Champion AJ Styles was interviewed about his match against Samoa Joe. He explained that he did not regret what he did to Joe, but was upset that he lost the match due to his actions. He warned Joe to never talk about his family again. Joe then attacked Styles from behind. On August 24, rematch between the two was scheduled for Hell in a Cell.\nThe New Day received a SmackDown Tag Team Championship rematch against The Bludgeon Brothers in a No Disqualification match. Xavier Woods and Kofi Kingston represented The New Day and defeated The Bludgeon Brothers to become three-time SmackDown Tag Team Champions. \nThe Miz faked a retirement speech by saying that he was retired from facing Daniel Bryan ever again. Bryan came out and called Miz a coward for having to cheat to win. He then said that General Manager Paige approved a mixed tag team match pitting himself and his wife Brie Bella against The Miz and his wife Maryse at Hell in a Cell. It was also announced that The Miz and Bryan would have a rematch at Super Show-Down, with the winner earning a future WWE Championship match.\nBecky Lynch explained her reasoning for attacking new SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair after the triple threat match. She claimed that she realized Charlotte had been holding her back the whole time and was not really her friend. Charlotte came out and the two brawled. Former champion Carmella was granted her rematch for the following week, where Flair retained. After the match, Lynch attacked Flair again. On the September 4 episode, a title match between Flair and Lynch was made official for Hell in a Cell.\nBecky Lynch's heel turn at SummerSlam would change her career.

        "title": "Royal Rumble (2019)",
        "text": "The 2019 Royal Rumble was the 32nd annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw, SmackDown, and 205 Live brand divisions. The event took place on January 27, 2019, at Chase Field in Phoenix, Arizona. During the event, WWE reported there were 48,193 people in attendance.\nTraditionally, the Royal Rumble match winner receives a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 2019 event, the winners of both the men's and women's matches received a choice of which championship to challenge for at WrestleMania 35. The men could choose to challenge for either Raw's Universal Championship or SmackDown's WWE Championship, while the women had the choice between the Raw Women's Championship and the SmackDown Women's Championship.\nIn total, 10 matches were contested at the event, including three on the Kickoff pre-show. In the main event, Raw's Seth Rollins won the men's Royal Rumble match by last eliminating Braun Strowman, also from Raw, while SmackDown's Becky Lynch won the women's Royal Rumble match by lastly eliminating Charlotte Flair, also from SmackDown. In the opening bout, Lynch lost her SmackDown Women's Championship match against Asuka. Other prominent matches included Brock Lesnar retaining Raw's Universal Championship against Finn Bálor, Daniel Bryan defeating AJ Styles to retain SmackDown's WWE Championship, and Ronda Rousey defeating Sasha Banks to retain the Raw Women's Championship. The event also featured the return of Jeff Jarrett, who competed in his first WWE match since No Mercy in October 1999.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick event produced every January by WWE since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, dubbed the \"Big Four\". It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. Announced on January 24, 2018, the 2019 event was the 32nd Royal Rumble and was scheduled to be held on January 27, 2019, at Chase Field in Phoenix, Arizona. It featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown, and 205 Live brand divisions. In addition to airing on traditional PPV, the event was livestreamed on the WWE Network. Tickets went on sale on October 12.\nThe Royal Rumble match generally features 30 wrestlers and the winner traditionally earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For 2019, the men and women could choose to challenge for either brand's top championship at WrestleMania 35: the men had their choice between Raw's Universal Championship or SmackDown's WWE Championship, while the women could choose either the Raw Women's Championship or the SmackDown Women's Championship.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised ten matches, including three on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw, SmackDown, and 205 Live brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\", \"SmackDown Live\", and the cruiserweight-exclusive \"205 Live\".\nAt , Fabulous Truth (Carmella and R-Truth) defeated Mahalicia (Alicia Fox and Jinder Mahal) to win the second season of Mixed Match Challenge. Their prize for winning was each getting the #30 spot in their respective Royal Rumble matches at the pay-per-view. In the weeks following TLC, multiple wrestlers were announced for both Rumble matches.\nAt Crown Jewel, Brock Lesnar defeated Braun Strowman to regain the then-vacant Universal Championship, thanks in part to then-Acting Raw General Manager Baron Corbin. At TLC, Strowman defeated Corbin in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match, thus stripping Corbin of his authoritative power and earning a Universal Championship match against Lesnar at the Royal Rumble. On the January 14 episode of \"Raw\", Corbin confronted Strowman and insulted him, leading to a chase to the parking area where Corbin hid in a limousine. Strowman shattered the glass and broke the door off, only for WWE Chairman Vince McMahon to appear, revealing that was his limo. Mr. McMahon then fined Strowman $100,000. Strowman then argued with Mr. McMahon, who then cancelled his match with Lesnar. An angry Strowman proceeded to flip over the limo. Later that night, John Cena, Drew McIntyre, Corbin, and Finn Bálor expressed their interests in facing Lesnar at the Royal Rumble. Mr. McMahon scheduled a fatal four-way match where the winner would face Lesnar, which Bálor won after defending his spot earlier in the night against Jinder Mahal. Due to this, Bálor was subsequently removed from the Royal Rumble match.\nAt TLC, Daniel Bryan defeated AJ Styles to retain the WWE Championship. On the January 1, 2019, episode of \"SmackDown\", Styles earned another opportunity against Bryan at the Royal Rumble by winning a fatal five-way match.\nAt TLC, Asuka defeated Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair in a triple threat Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match to win the SmackDown Women's Championship. Following the event, The McMahon Family (Vince McMahon, Shane McMahon, Stephanie McMahon, and Triple H) decreed that champions would no longer have automatic rematch clauses, ruling Lynch out of a guaranteed rematch. After she, Flair, and Carmella all pleaded their cases for why they deserved a title opportunity on the January 1, 2019, episode of \"SmackDown\", WWE Chief Operating Officer Triple H scheduled a triple threat match between the three for the following week to determine Asuka's challenger at the Royal Rumble, which was won by Lynch.\nAt TLC, Ronda Rousey retained the Raw Women's Championship against Nia Jax. On the January 7, 2019, episode of \"Raw\", Rousey appeared on Alexa Bliss' interview segment, \"A Moment of Bliss\", and stated that she wanted to face Sasha Banks next, believing Banks to be a true test of her abilities. Jax interrupted, wanting a rematch against Rousey. Banks then came out and challenged Jax to a match in which the winner would face Rousey for the Raw Women's Championship at the Royal Rumble, which Banks won.\nAt Crown Jewel, Shane McMahon won the WWE World Cup, replacing The Miz in the finals, who was deemed unable to compete due to a pre-match brawl. Following this, The Miz began a pursuit to form a tag team with Shane, claiming that they could be the best tag team in the world. Shane finally agreed to the pairing, and on the January 8, 2019, episode of \"SmackDown\", Miz challenged The Bar (Cesaro and Sheamus) for the SmackDown Tag Team Championship at the Royal Rumble, and The Bar accepted.\nOn the TLC Kickoff pre-show, Buddy Murphy retained the WWE Cruiserweight Championship against Cedric Alexander. On the December 26, 2018, episode of \"205 Live\", General Manager Drake Maverick scheduled Murphy to defend the title at the Royal Rumble in a fatal four-way match with his opponents to be decided in qualifying matches. The following week, Kalisto and Akira Tozawa qualified for the match by defeating Lio Rush and Drew Gulak, respectively. Hideo Itami won the final spot by defeating Alexander. The match was scheduled for the Royal Rumble Kickoff pre-show.\nOn the December 25, 2018, episode of \"SmackDown\", Rusev defeated Shinsuke Nakamura to win the United States Championship. On the January 1, 2019, episode, while Rusev and his wife/manager Lana were celebrating the title win, Nakamura attacked Rusev with Lana also getting hurt in the scuffle. On the January 15 episode, Rusev was scheduled to defend the title against Nakamura on the Royal Rumble Kickoff pre-show.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nThree matches were contested on the Royal Rumble Kickoff pre-show. In the first match, AOP manager Drake Maverick announced a tag team match between Raw Tag Team Champions Bobby Roode and Chad Gable and the team of Scott Dawson (of The Revival) and Rezar (of AOP), with both The Revival and AOP receiving a Raw Tag Team Championship match if they won. In the end, Roode and Gable performed a moonsault/neckbreaker combo on Dawson to win the match.\nNext, Rusev defended the United States Championship against Shinsuke Nakamura. In the climax, Rusev's wife Lana stood on the ring apron to notify the referee of Nakamura removing the turnbuckle, which led to Nakamura staring her down. As Rusev attacked Nakamura, he accidentally knocked down his wife. Distracted, Nakamura took advantage and attacked Rusev with the \"Kinshasa\" to win the title for a second time.\nThe final match on the pre-show was the fatal four-way match in which Buddy Murphy defended the WWE Cruiserweight Championship against Akira Tozawa, Hideo Itami, and Kalisto. In the climax, Murphy performed \"Murphy's Law\" on Itami to retain the title.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with Asuka defending the SmackDown Women's Championship against Becky Lynch. The climax saw Asuka counter a \"Dis-Arm-Her\" from Lynch into an inverted \"Asuka Lock\", which caused Lynch to submit and allowed Asuka to retain her championship.\nIn the second match, The Bar (Cesaro and Sheamus) defended the SmackDown Tag Team Championship against The Miz and Shane McMahon. In the end, Sheamus inadvertently performed a \"Brogue Kick\" on Cesaro, before Miz performed a \"Skull-Crushing Finale\" on Sheamus. Shane then performed a shooting star press on Cesaro to win the titles.\nNext, Ronda Rousey defended the Raw Women's Championship against Sasha Banks. During the match, Rousey attempted a forearm on Banks, who moved out of the way, causing it to crash into the ring post. Banks then focused on further weakening the arm. Later, Banks performed a \"suicide dive\" on Rousey, who caught her and applied an \"armbar\" on Banks, who submitted, but since it was outside of the ring, the match continued. In the climax, Banks applied the \"Bank Statement\". Rousey tried to make it to the bottom rope, but Banks transitioned into a crucifix pin for a nearfall and applied a \"Fujiwara armbar\". Rousey escaped the submission and followed up with a gutwrench powerbomb and \"Piper's Pit\" on Banks, giving Rousey her first pinfall victory in the WWE and thus retaining the title.\nThe fourth match was the 30-woman Royal Rumble match for a women's championship match at WrestleMania 35. Lacey Evans, making her main roster debut, and Natalya began the match. Natalya applied a sharpshooter on Evans and Mandy Rose (entrant #3) at the same time before Liv Morgan entered at #4. She was quickly eliminated by Natalya in eight seconds. NXT's Xia Li, Kairi Sane, Candice LeRae, Kacy Catanzaro, Io Shirai, and NXT UK's Rhea Ripley were all surprise entrants at #11, #14, #17, #19, #23 and #24 respectively. After Naomi (entrant #16) eliminated Rose, she leapt from the ring barricade onto the steel steps, only for Rose to pull her off the apron and eliminate her. Catanzaro had another save from elimination, walking on her hands to the ring post, but was eliminated by Ripley. The match also saw an appearance by Hornswoggle, who aided in the elimination of Zelina Vega (entrant #20). Lana was scheduled to enter the match at number 28 but still suffered from her injury from the pre-show. Afterwards, Nia Jax (entrant #29) attacked Lana, rendering her unable to compete. Jax would go on to eliminate Shirai, Natalya (who lasted the longest in a women's Royal Rumble match at 56 minutes until it was surpassed by Bianca Belair in 2021), and Bayley (entrant #27). After Carmella entered at #30, Becky Lynch appeared and replaced Lana in the match. Alexa Bliss eliminated Ember Moon, who lasted 52 minutes. Afterwards, Bayley and Carmella worked together to eliminate Bliss. Flair then eliminated Carmella, bringing the final four to Lynch, Flair, Bayley, and Jax. In the climax, Flair sent Jax over the top rope, and Lynch (who was outside of the ring, though not eliminated) eliminated Jax, bringing the final two to Lynch and Flair. Jax shoved Lynch off the steel ring steps, giving her a (storyline) knee injury. After a short battle between Flair and Lynch, Flair attempted a Big Boot, but Lynch countered and sent Flair over the top rope. Lynch then performed a clothesline on Flair to win the match and earn a women's championship match at WrestleMania 35.\nAfter that, Daniel Bryan defended the WWE Championship against AJ Styles. In the climax, a returning Rowan appeared. Bryan then accidentally performed an enzuigiri on the referee. Styles performed a \"Styles Clash\" on Bryan but Rowan performed a Clawhold Slam on Styles. Bryan then pinned Styles to retain the title.\nIn the penultimate match, Brock Lesnar defended the Universal Championship against Finn Bálor. Bálor quickly took to the offense. In the climax, Bálor performed the \"Coup de Grâce\" on Lesnar, but Lesnar kicked out and immediately applied a kimura lock on Bálor, who submitted, to retain the title. After the match, Lesnar performed three German suplexes and an \"F-5\" on Bálor.\nMain event.\nThe main event was the 30-man Royal Rumble match for a world championship match at WrestleMania 35. Elias began the match at number one and was interrupted by WWE Hall of Famer Jeff Jarrett, entering the match at number 2. Elias bashed a guitar on Jarrett before eliminating him. NXT North American Champion Johnny Gargano, WWE United Kingdom Champion Pete Dunne and Aleister Black were surprise entrants at #6, #18 and #21 respectively. Curt Hawkins (entrant #9) was knocked out by Samoa Joe (entrant #8), but went underneath the ring. Titus O'Neil (entrant #11) did not trip underneath the ring, like he did at the Greatest Royal Rumble. However, O'Neil chased Hawkins underneath the ring and back inside where Hawkins eliminated O'Neil, only to be eliminated by Joe. No Way Jose was quickly eliminated by Joe in two seconds. Kofi Kingston (entrant #12) saved himself from elimination two separate times, but was eliminated alongside Xavier Woods (entrant #17) by Drew McIntyre (entrant #16). Bobby Lashley (entrant #26) was quickly eliminated by Seth Rollins (entrant #10) in eleven seconds, and performed a spinebuster on Rollins through an announce table before Braun Strowman entered at #27. As #30 entrant R-Truth made his entrance, he was attacked by Nia Jax, who took his spot and eliminated Mustafa Ali. Jax then received a superkick from Dolph Ziggler, a \"619\" from Rey Mysterio, and an \"RKO\" from Randy Orton before being eliminated by Mysterio. Jax became the fourth woman to enter a men's Royal Rumble match, the first person to compete in both the men's and women's Royal Rumble matches in the same night, and the first to score eliminations in both matches. Orton then eliminated Mysterio before being eliminated by Andrade, bringing the final four to Andrade, Ziggler, Strowman, and Rollins. Ziggler, Andrade, and Rollins tried to eliminate Strowman, only for Strowman to eliminate Andrade and Ziggler. In the end, Rollins and Strowman battled on the ring apron, which ended when Rollins performed a Stomp on Strowman, eliminating him from the match, and earning Rollins a world championship match at WrestleMania 35.\nAftermath.\nRaw.\nThe following night on \"Raw\", Raw Women's Champion Ronda Rousey issued an open challenge that was answered by Bayley. After retaining, women's Royal Rumble match winner Becky Lynch made her entrance and confronted Rousey. After recapping their rivalry that began at Survivor Series, Lynch chose to face Rousey for the Raw Women's Championship at WrestleMania 35.\nSeth Rollins celebrated his Royal Rumble match victory. Triple H then came out and congratulated him, but said that Rollins needed to choose which champion he wanted to face at WrestleMania 35 by the end of the night. Backstage, Braun Strowman, the runner up in the Royal Rumble match, confronted Rollins and told him he \"earned it\", and to \"make the right decision\". Later, Rollins confronted Brock Lesnar. After an ensuing brawl, Rollins chose to face Lesnar for the Universal Championship at WrestleMania 35.\nSmackDown.\nOn the following \"SmackDown\", Becky Lynch addressed how everything had changed for her since winning the women's Royal Rumble match. Charlotte Flair then came out and congratulated Lynch and stated that although Lynch won, she was never truly in the match in the first place, and that Lynch would not be where she was at if it were not for Flair. An ensuing brawl broke out between Flair and Lynch until referees separated them.\nAs compensation for not being able to compete in the men's Royal Rumble match, R-Truth was granted a United States Championship match against new champion Shinsuke Nakamura. Truth defeated Nakamura to win the title, which led to Rusev coming out and declaring that Truth was not worthy of the title. Rusev then challenged Truth for the title, but was also defeated. After the match, Rusev turned heel and, along with Nakamura, attacked Truth.\nDaniel Bryan, along with his new ally Rowan, revealed a new custom WWE Championship belt, made from hemp and wood. He was then interrupted by AJ Styles, which prompted Jeff Hardy, Samoa Joe, Randy Orton, and Mustafa Ali to come out and challenge Bryan for the title. After an ensuing brawl, Triple H announced that Bryan would defend the title against the five at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view inside the Elimination Chamber. Ali, however, was replaced by Kofi Kingston after suffering an injury.\nNew SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Miz and Shane McMahon celebrated their title win along with Miz's father. Later that night, The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) defeated Heavy Machinery (Otis Dozovic and Tucker Knight), Sheamus and Cesaro, and The New Day (represented by Big E and Kofi Kingston) in a fatal four-way tag team elimination match to become the number one contenders for the titles at Elimination Chamber.\n205 Live.\nOn the February 5, 2019, episode of \"205 Live\", Akira Tozawa won a fatal four-way elimination match to earn another title match against WWE Cruiserweight Champion Buddy Murphy on the Elimination Chamber Kickoff pre-show.\nThis would be the only Royal Rumble to include the 205 Live brand, as in September, 205 Live merged under NXT. Also at that time and until September 2021, NXT was elevated to WWE's third main brand, and its championships, the NXT Championship and NXT Women's Championship, became eligible choices for the Rumble winners at the next two Royal Rumble events.\nResults.\nWomen's Royal Rumble match entrances and eliminations.\n(*) - Mandy Rose was already eliminated when she eliminated Naomi.\n(**) - Lana came out as the #28 entrant, but a storyline ankle injury suffered on the pre-show kept her from competing. Becky Lynch was allowed to take her spot.\nMen's Royal Rumble match entrances and eliminations.\n(*) - The original #30 entrant was R-Truth, but he was attacked and replaced by Nia Jax before he could compete."

South Carolina won the ACC tournament championship, defeating North Carolina in the championship game 52–51. This was the last season South Carolina ever played in the ACC. The success South Carolina achieved on the court brought resentment and anger from fellow ACC schools, especially those on \"Tobacco Road,\" as the conference members of the state of North Carolina were known. The hostility of the road crowds, the unfriendly behavior of coaches and athletic directors in the conference, and the discrepancies in eligibility standards led head coach Frank McGuire to support South Carolina becoming an Independent before the 1971–72 season. Despite South Carolina leaving the ACC in 1971, (as of 2018) they still remain the only school in the state of South Carolina to win an ACC tournament championship, even though Clemson, still remains in the ACC."
