In 1961–62, he scored 21 goals as the youngest player on the AHL Buffalo Bisons, Chicago's top minor-league affiliate, and appeared in his first two NHL games. Hall also received a surprising opportunity to play in the NHL All-Star Game, which at the time was between the defending Stanley Cup champions (Chicago won in 1961), and a team of all-stars from the rest of the league. Chicago took the opportunity to give Hall and Chico Maki, two of their top prospects, some valuable experience.\nOver the next two seasons, Hall established himself as an elite minor-league scorer (playing on a line with and outscoring Phil Esposito in the EPHL in 1962–63), but struggled to take the next step to the NHL. In 1963–64, he scored just 2 points in 23 games in Chicago, and following the season was selected by the Detroit Red Wings in the intra-league draft. In Detroit, his fortunes were much the same. He easily led the Wings' AHL affiliate in scoring over the next two years, but only appeared in a few games in Detroit. In 1966–67, he finally produced in NHL action, scoring 4 goals and 7 points in a 12-game stint in Detroit.\nSelected by the Minnesota North Stars in the 1967 NHL Expansion Draft, Hall was expected to be a key part of their first-year squad, but struggled scoring just 3 points in 17 games, and his rights were dealt to the Toronto Maple Leafs. He was assigned to the Vancouver Canucks of the Western Hockey League in 1968, and spent the following two seasons there.\nIn 1970, the owners of the Canucks were granted an NHL expansion franchise of the same name, and Hall was one of several players who stayed with the organization. This time, he took advantage of his opportunity, scoring 21 goals and 38 assists for 59 points, good for 4th on the team in scoring and 2nd in assists. However, his scoring touch didn't last as he slumped to just 6 goals and 12 points in 32 games in 1971–72, and found himself back in the AHL.\nHall jumped to the upstart World Hockey Association for 1972–73, one of four Canucks (along with Ted Taylor, Poul Popiel, and John Schella) to sign with the Houston Aeros. He rediscovered his scoring touch in the WHA, scoring 70 points in his first year in Houston. With the arrival of Gordie Howe in 1973, Houston dominated the WHA over the next two seasons, and Hall was a key component of teams which won back-to-back Avco Cup championships in 1974 and 1975, scoring an impressive 16 goals in 27 playoff games over those two years. Hall spent one more season with Houston in 1975–76, and had a brief stint in the CHL before retiring in 1977.\nIn 164 NHL games, Hall recorded 35 goals and 48 assists for 83 points, along with 46 penalty minutes. In an additional 312 WHA contests, he netted 96 goals and added 125 assists for a total of 221 points, along with 155 penalty minutes."

It wasn't dirty and it wasn't meant to happen that way. Still, it's very hard because I made the play. It's always in the back of my mind.\"\nAfter Harris retired from the NHL, he began getting involved in other areas of the game, coaching the Windsor Spitfires and Spokane Flyers at the major junior level, and later working as an assistant coach for the Quebec Nordiques in the NHL."

        "text": "Donald Clinton Jackson (born September 2, 1956) is an American ice hockey coach and former professional ice hockey player who played 315 games in the National Hockey League between 1978 and 1987. Jackson began his coaching career in 1988.\nFrom May 2014 through May 2023, he served as head coach of EHC Red Bull München. During his time in Munich, he won five Deutsche Eishockey Liga titles. \nPlaying career.\nJackson grew up playing ice hockey in Bloomington, Minnesota, for John F. Kennedy High School and earned a scholarship to attend and play for the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame. Prior to graduating from the University of Notre Dame in 1978, Jackson was drafted by the Minnesota North Stars in the NHL's 1976 Amateur Draft, third round, 39th overall. He played 2 games for the North Stars late in the 1978 season after finishing his college career and spent most of the next 3 seasons playing for the North Stars minor league team, the Oklahoma City Stars. Prior to the 1981–82 NHL season, Jackson was traded to the Edmonton Oilers and played most of that season with Edmonton's minor league team, the Wichita Wind. Jackson earned his NHL break at the beginning of the 1982–83 season and played 262 games for the Oilers, earning Stanley Cup Champion rings in 1984 and 1985. After the 1985–86 season, Jackson was traded to the New York Rangers for his final NHL season before retiring.\nJackson was also a member of the United States Ice Hockey World Cup team at the 1978 and 1979 Ice Hockey World Championship tournaments.\nCoaching career.\nJackson returned to ice hockey in 1989 as the head coach for the Knoxville Cherokees of the East Coast Hockey League (ECHL). His success with the Cherokees during the 1990–91 earned him recognition as Coach of the Year. In 1991, Jackson was hired by Pierre Page as an assistant coach for the Quebec Nordiques, where he served for 3 seasons. He moved on to serve as head coach for the Cincinnati Cyclones of the IHL for the 1994–95 season, the Wichita Thunder of the Central Hockey League for the 1995–96 season and the Kansas City Blades of the IHL for the 1996–97 season. In 1997, Jackson was hired by Kevin Constantine as assistant coach for the Pittsburgh Penguins, serving 3 seasons. Jackson was employed as assistant coach by the Chicago Blackhawks for 3 months of the 2000–01 season, and was named assistant coach of the Ottawa Senators the following year. Jackson stayed with the Senators until his contract ended without being renewed in 2004.\nThe 2004–05 NHL Lockout pushed Jackson to find a coaching role in Europe. Late into the 2004–05 season of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (German Hockey League), Jackson was asked by General Manager Peter Lee and Head Coach Pierre Page to join the Eisbären Berlin coaching staff as an assistant. Berlin won their first championship that season.\nBerlin's success helped Jackson earn his first head coaching position in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL) with Lance Nethery and DEG Metro Stars of Düsseldorf, who ended the 2004–05 season in 10th place. In Jackson's first season, 2005–06, in Düsseldorf, he coached the team to a third-place regular season finish and into the playoff finals, where they lost against the Eisbären Berlin in 2006 DEL playoff finals. Jackson carried that success into a second season in Düsseldorf, finishing second in regular season play and losing in the playoff semi-finals.\nAfter the 2006–07 season Jackson moved on to fill the head coach position for the Eisbären Berlin of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga, who had finished in 9th place. Jackson repeated the success he demonstrated in Düsseldorf by coaching Eisbären Berlin to a second-place regular season finish and a playoff finals DEL championship in his first season there. For that achievement, Jackson was awarded the Order of Merit of Berlin. In his six seasons as head coach with Eisbären Berlin (2007–13), Jackson coached the team to 3 first-place regular season finishes, 5 DEL championships, and a 2010 victory for the European Trophy (currently, Champions Hockey League).\nIn 2013, Jackson joined Red Bull Hockey to coach their team EC Red Bull Salzburg in the Austrian Hockey League for the 2013–14 season, which had finished their previous season in 8th place. Jackson again repeated his success by coaching the team to a first-place regular season finish, losing a game 7 overtime in the League Playoff finals. After the season, Red Bull Hockey moved Jackson to their team, EHC Red Bull München, for the 2014–15 season where the team finished second overall but exited the playoffs early. The second-place finish earned Red Bull München a position in the 2015–16 Champions Hockey League, where they won in the group stage to advance to the playoff, then lost in the round of 32. Jackson's leadership of EHC Red Bull München for the 2015–16 season again improved on the team's success by finishing in first place in regular season play, and culminating in a 4-game sweep of the Wolfsburg Grizzlys for the 2016 DEL Playoff Championship. This is the 6th DEL Playoff Championship for Jackson in his 10 years as a head coach in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga.\nIn both the 2016–17 and 2017-18 campaigns, Jackson led Munich to a successful defense of its title, capturing his seventh and eighth German championships as a head coach."

        "text": "Michael Johnson Pyle (July 18, 1939 – July 29, 2015) was an American professional football player who was a center for nine seasons between 1961 and 1969 in the National Football League (NFL) for the Chicago Bears. In 2019 he was selected as one of the 100 greatest Bears of All-Time.\nBackground.\nPyle was born in 1939 to William Palmer Pyle, an executive with Kraft Foods, and Cathryn Johnson Pyle in Keokuk, Iowa. He has two brothers: William Palmer Pyle Jr. (who played offensive guard at Michigan State University and with the Baltimore Colts, the Minnesota Vikings and the Oakland Raiders) and Harlen Pyle. From Palmer's family, his nephew is Eric Kumerow, and his grand-nephews are Joey and Nick Bosa, as well as Jake Kumerow.\nPyle attended New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois, where he wrestled and threw the discus and shot put in addition to playing football. He was an Illinois state wrestling champion in 1957 in the heavyweight division. He also won a state championship in 1957 for his efforts with the discus and set a state record on his way to winning the shot put title, as well.\nHe graduated in 1957 from New Trier and went on to Yale University, where he was a member of Skull and Bones and Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He was an offensive lineman for the Bulldogs and captained the undefeated, co-Lambert Trophy winner 1960 team. The 1960 team was ranked 14th in the final AP college football poll and 18th in the final UPI college football poll.\nChicago Bears.\nPyle played nine seasons with the Chicago Bears from 1961 through 1969 where he played for George Halas. In 1963, he earned a Pro Bowl berth and served as the Bears offensive team captain from 1963, their championship season, through his retirement. He was named to the \"Sporting News\" First-team - All Conference and the UPI Second-team - All NFL in 1963 and to the \"New York Daily News\" All NFL team in 1965.\nBroadcast career.\nAfter his retirement in 1969, Pyle was a broadcaster for WGN radio, where he was the Bears pre and post game program host, as well as the host of a Sunday sports talk show. He later co-hosted the \"Mike Ditka Show\" when Ditka coached the Bears.\nIn 1974, he served as color commentator on the broadcasts of the WFL's Chicago Fire on WJJD.\nPost career health problems.\nSeveral years after retiring from the NFL, Pyle began to experience symptoms of dementia. His condition eventually worsened, and his family was forced to put him into a full-time assisted living facility. Pyle went to Silverado, a national chain that has an arrangement with the NFL to treat all former players with at least three years of service — and dementia — free of charge.\n‘‘We have treated about 20 NFL players — we have about a dozen right now,’’ Loren Shook, the president and CEO of Silverado Senior Living, says. ‘‘This is under the ‘88 Plan’ with the NFL.’’\nThe 88 Plan is a brain trauma program named for Hall of Fame tight end John Mackey, whose number was 88. Mackey was in a near vegetative state from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) by the time he died in 2011. Pyle died on July 29, 2015, from a brain hemorrhage. He is one of at least 345 NFL players to be diagnosed after death (CTE) with this disease, which is caused by repeated hits to the head."

        "text": "The Butler Bulldogs men's basketball team represents Butler University in Indianapolis, Indiana. The school's team currently competes in the Big East Conference. They play their home games at Hinkle Fieldhouse.\nHistory.\nButler competed as part of the Horizon League since its founding, and played basketball in other regional conferences before that, including the Missouri Valley Conference. In 2012 they left the Horizon League for the Atlantic 10 and the year after, moved to the Big East.\nDespite having played in a mid-major conference, Butler rose to national prominence in the late 1990s. They ranked in most media polls for all but a few weeks from the 2006–07 season to the 2011–12 season, and competed in the postseason every year since 1997, except for 2004, 2005, and 2014. In the 2010 NCAA tournament, Butler was the National runner-up to Duke, advancing to the National Championship Game after defeating Michigan State in the Final Four. With a total enrollment of only 4,500 students, Butler is the smallest school to play for a national championship since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985. The Bulldogs also went to the championship game in the following NCAA tournament, falling to UConn after defeating VCU in the Final Four. With the victory over VCU, Butler became the first mid-major program to reach the championship game in successive seasons since 1979, when seeding of the tournament began, and the only team from the state of Indiana to reach back-to-back championship games. The Bulldogs also won the National Championship in 1927, though it was before March Madness so it does not count for NCAA records.\nAfter spending one season in the Atlantic 10 Conference, Butler moved into the realigned basketball-only Big East Conference for the 2013–14 season. Their first season was mediocre, finishing 9th out of 10 teams with a 14–17 record, their first losing record since 2004–05. In their second season, despite being picked to finish 7th, the Bulldogs surprised many by finishing tied for second place in the conference. Butler finished the 2015–16 season in a tie for fourth place in Big East play with a record of 21–11, 10–8 in conference and receiving a bid to the NCAA tournament where they advanced to the Second Round.\nBasketball community.\nBecause of the school's history of basketball success, location in the heart of the land of \"Hoosier Hysteria\", and lack of a scholarship football program, the Butler University fan base is primarily basketball-oriented. Other athletics enjoy substantial followings of current students and alumni, but only basketball has garnered interest from a national audience.\nTwo studies estimated that television, print, and online news coverage of Butler's 2010 and 2011 appearances in the NCAA tournament championship game resulted in additional publicity for the university worth about $1.2 billion. In an example of the \"Flutie effect\", applications rose by 41% after the 2010 appearance. In June 2011, \"USA Today\" ranked Butler as one of the top five colleges making use of social media. Specific to basketball, Butler's mascot, Butler Blue, the men's basketball program, head coach Thad Matta, and other coaches have university-endorsed Twitter accounts. Also, online communities Butler Hoops and /r/ButlerUniversity exist to facilitate discussion among fans.\nIn recent years, the Butler program has also received national attention for its philosophy to the game, which it calls \"The Butler Way\". At its core, The Butler Way calls for complete commitment and exalts teamwork above self.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Bulldogs have appeared in 16 NCAA Tournaments. Their combined record is 24–16.\n \nNIT results.\nThe Bulldogs have appeared in ten National Invitation Tournaments.

He threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed .\nHe was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, the second oldest child and oldest son of nine children of Jacob Sr. and Roberta Wood. Wood grew up in an integrated neighborhood, learned to play stickball and baseball as a youth, and graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School in 1955. He earned a scholarship to Delaware State University in Dover, Delaware, and he played one season of college ball.\nWood was signed as an amateur free agent by the Tigers in early 1957. He attended Detroit's minor league camp in Lakeland, Florida, worked his way up through the Tigers' system, and batted more than .300 with five teams in the minors. Jake made his major league debut at age 23 on the Tigers' season-opener on April 11, 1961, starting at second base and batting leadoff in a 9–5 home loss to the Cleveland Indians. Facing Indians pitcher Jim Perry for the fourth time in the game during the seventh inning, the hard-hitting Wood collected his first career hit in a big way with a two-run home run that scored Bobo Osborne.\nWood was the first African-American starter developed by Detroit's organization, but when right-handed pitcher Jim Proctor debuted for Detroit on September 14, 1959, he became the first black player developed by the Tigers' system.\nQuiet, agile, and talented, Wood remained the Tigers' starting second baseman from to . He was third in the American League in stolen bases in 1961 (30), (24), and 1963 (18). During his rookie season in 1961, Wood was also among the American League leaders in runs (96), hits (171), and games (162). He led the AL in triples in 1961 with 14 and in strikeouts with 141—at the time, the record for most strikeouts in a season.\nWood injured a finger late July 1963, and he missed the rest of the season. Starting in 1964, after Detroit acquired veteran second baseman Jerry Lumpe, Wood was a utility infielder and backup second baseman. He remained a reserve for the rest of his career, for example, playing in 98 games and hitting .252 in 1966. On June 23, 1967, during his seventh season with the Tigers, his contract was purchased by the Reds, for whom he played 16 games, with his final major league career appearance coming on August 11, 1967.\nJake ended his major league career with a .250 batting average with 35 home runs, 168 runs batted in and 70 stolen bases.\nHis brother, Richard Wood, played professional football from 1975 to 1984 with the New York Jets and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nJake lives in Pensacola, Florida where, as of 2012, he continued to remain active, playing in over-70 softball leagues and tournaments as well as playing racquetball. He also mentors inmates at the Escambia County, Florida jail as part of the \"A Will and a Way\" ministry, and he participates in Tigers' reunions, autograph shows, and fantasy camps as well as Negro leagues events.\nWood is a member of the Union County, New Jersey Baseball Hall of Fame."

        "title": "1993 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament",
        "text": "The 1993 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament began on March 17 and ended on April 4. The tournament featured 48 teams. The Final Four consisted of Ohio State, Iowa, Vanderbilt, and Texas Tech, with Texas Tech defeating Ohio State 84–82 to win its first NCAA title. Texas Tech's Sheryl Swoopes was named the Most Outstanding Player of the tournament.\nTo date, this is the last time UConn has failed to advance to the Sweet Sixteen or later.\nNotable events.\nOhio State failed to earn an invitation to the NCAA tournament in the prior two years, but in 1993, they added Katie Smith, the Gatorade National player of the year, to the roster, who helped lead the team to a 24–3 regular season record and an NCAA invitation as a 1 seed. The Buckeyes won their first two games easily, but faced a challenge in the East Regional final game against Virginia. The Cavaliers had been in the three previous Final Fours, including a national runner up finish in 1991. Despite 30 points from Virginia's Heather Burge, the Ohio State team won a close match, 75–73, to move on to their first ever NCAA Final Four. With time winding down, and trailing by two points, Virginia raced down the court and Dana Evans would hit a three-point shot, but it was disallowed, because the coach had called a timeout with 0.6 seconds left in the game. The inbounds pass was never touched, and went out of bounds, turning the ball over to Ohio State. Although they only had to inbound the ball, the inbounder stepped on the line, giving the ball back to Virginia. However, the inbounds pass by the Cavaliers was blocked, and Ohio State held on to win.\nIn the Mideast Regional, the Tennessee team was the top seed. Tennessee had won the National Championship three of the prior six years an advanced to the regional final with wins of 20 points or more in their first two games. Iowa, who had shared the championship of the Big Ten with Ohio State, was the second seed in the region, and faced Tennessee in the regional Final. Iowa was coached by Hall of Fame coach C. Vivian Stringer who had lost her husband to a heart attack during the season. The Tennessee team was trying to win the 500th victory for their coach Pat Summitt. The Iowa team would prevail, sending Iowa to their first ever Final Four (although the coach had been in the first NCAA Final four as coach of Cheyney State).\nTexas Tech was the second seeded team in the West regional, where long time power Stanford was the top seed. However, Colorado upset Stanford in the regional semi-finals, while Texas Tech beat Washington, then USC to face Colorado in the regional finals. That game wasn't close, as Texas Tech, with Sheryl Swoopes, the \"Michael Jordan of women's basketball\" beat Colorado by 25 points to make it to their first ever Final Four. This set up a match up with Vanderbilt, the number one seeded winner of the Midwest Regional, who were also appearing in their first ever Final Four.\nThe Final Four included four teams who had never been in a Final Four before, the first time that had happened since the very first NCAA Final Four in 1982. In one semifinal, second seeded Texas Tech faced a number one seed in Vanderbilt, but Texas Tech would win easily, 60–46, while Vanderbilt set a tournament record for fewest points in a half, of a semi-final game, with only 20 points in the second half.\nIn the other semifinal, two Big Ten teams faced each other. Ohio State and Iowa had squared off twice in the regular season, with each winning their game at home. This time, they faced each other for the chance to play in the national championship game. At the end of regulation though, the game was tied, and they had to go to an overtime period. A timeout had been crucial in the Ohio State win over Virginia, and would become crucial in this game as well. Near the end of the game, the Iowa coach tried to signal a timeout, but the refs did not see the signal, and Iowa player Laurie Aaron tripped over a player on the floor with six seconds to go, losing the ball and turning it over. Ohio State recovered the ball and held on for a one-point victory 73–72.\nIn the championship game, Swoopes scored 23 points in the first half to help Texas Tech take a nine-point lead at half-time. The Buckeyes did not fold, and fought back to take a 55–54 lead midway through the second half. However, Swoopes continued her record-breaking night, and scored 24 points in the second half. She completed a three-point play on a layup and foul shot to give her team a seven-point lead with under a minute to go. Ohio State hit two three-pointers in the final seconds, but it wasn't enough, and the Red Raiders won their first national championship with a score of 84–82.\nQualifying teams – automatic.\nForty-eight teams were selected to participate in the 1993 NCAA Tournament. Twenty-three conferences were eligible for an automatic bid to the 1993 NCAA tournament.\nQualifying teams – at-large.\nTwenty-five additional teams were selected to complete the forty-eight invitations.\nBids by conference.\nTwenty-three conferences earned an automatic bid. In fourteen cases, the automatic bid was the only representative from the conference. Two conferences, Great Midwest and North Atlantic sent a single representative as an at-large team. Twenty-three additional at-large teams were selected from nine of the conferences.\nFirst and second rounds.\nIn 1993, the field remained at 48 teams. The teams were seeded, and assigned to four geographic regions, with seeds 1–12 in each region. In Round 1, seeds 8 and 9 faced each other for the opportunity to face the 1 seed in the second round, seeds 7 and 10 played for the opportunity to face the 2 seed, seeds 5 and 12 played for the opportunity to face the 4 seed, and seeds 6 and 11 played for the opportunity to face the 3 seed. In the first two rounds, the higher seed was given the opportunity to host the first-round game. In most cases, the higher seed accepted the opportunity. The exception:\nOld Dominion served as a host for the first round as well as the second round, so it is listed twice.\nThe following table lists the region, host school, venue and the thirty-two first and second round locations:\nRegionals and Final Four.\nThe Regionals, named for the general location, were held from March 25 to March 27 at these sites:\nEach regional winner advanced to the Final Four, held April 3 and April 4 in Atlanta, Georgia at the Omni Coliseum, (Host: Georgia Tech)\nBids by state.\nThe forty-eight teams came from twenty-seven states, plus Washington, D.C. California had the most teams with six bids. Twenty-three states did not have any teams receiving bids.\nBrackets.\nFirst and second-round games played at higher seed except where noted.\nRecord by conference.\nFifteen conferences had more than one bid, or at least one win in NCAA Tournament play:\nTen conferences went 0-1: Big Sky Conference, Great Midwest Conference, MAAC, MAC, Mid-Continent, Midwestern Collegiate, North Atlantic Conference, Ohio Valley Conference, Southern Conference, and West Coast Conference"

The GTCC has been consistently successful throughout its history, most recently winning the 2006/07 3rd Grade Priemiership, and following it up by going back to back in 2007/08.\nGeorge Town's home ground Crothers Oval is named after former games record holder and life member, Peter Crothers. The oval is the best seeing ground in the competition outside of the NTCA ground, with elevated views available from both sides of the field. Crothers Oval is also home to one of the most consistent centre wickets in the NTCA despite the club relying on volunteers to complete the pitch preparation rather than a full-time curator.\nThe last three years have been a trying time for the club, with its mostly poor performances in the higher grades owing to dwindling player numbers and a lack of sponsorship. However, recent recruiting strategies and successes and a reshuffling of personnel mean that the club will soon return to A Grade success. For the 2008/09 season, Forest Enterprises Australia has secured naming rights for the GTCC, and the teams will be known as \"FEA George Town\".\nThe 2009/10 season is shaping up as a year of rebuilding for the club, however the procurement of coach Michael Doherty's services has brought a sense of expectation and excitement to the playing group.\nGeorge Town have pulled out of the NTCA competition since the 2015 season, whilst still entering teams into the 2nd and 3rd grade competitions."

The city was divided into zones and players had to represent the club whose zone they lived in. This was an Australia-wide movement aimed at creating a more even grade cricket competition and generate suburban loyalty and rivalry. South Launceston joined North, East, West and Central Launceston in the new NTCA district competition for the 1907-08 season.\nSouth has won a total of 15 premierships. In the period between 1936 and 1941 the club won 4 NTCA premierships and 2 state premierships. The most recent A Grade premiership was in 2017-2018.\nThe club has at times suffered financial setbacks, especially around the time of World War II, and the club was threatened with expulsion form the NTCA due to non-payment of fees. It survived thanks to the committeemen of the club who gave their personal guarantees to cover any outstanding debts, and eventually the debts were cleared.\nIn more recent times, the club has experienced an era of success, with the Men's First Grade side regularly competing in finals and grand finals, and the Women's First Grade team winning their 6th consecutive premiership in 2020-21. Participation numbers are also at an all time high, with the club recently fielding 3x third grade teams in 2020-21, to accompany their first and second grade men's teams.\nNotable overseas players include Jack \"Flatjack\" Simmons (also captained Tasmania) and Andrew Hayhurst of the UK.

        "text": "Daniel Brendon Carroll DSC (17 November 1887, possibly 1892 – 5 August 1956) was an Australian national representative rugby union player. He was a dual Olympic gold medalist winning in rugby at the 1908 Summer Olympics for Australia and also winning gold for the United States at the 1920 Summer Olympics.\nAge.\nHe is erroneously referred to in some records as the youngest ever Australian representative rugby player due to a birthdate error in the Olympic records database. He served in the American Army as a lieutenant in World War I and lived out his life in the US working in the mining/petroleum industry.\nSchooling and early rugby.\nCarroll was born at Flemington, Victoria. His family relocated to Sydney during his early childhood and he was educated at St Aloysius' College (Sydney) playing rugby in the school's first XV and then at Sydney University where he studied dentistry. His club rugby was played with St George in southern Sydney. He was a winger at that time and in that position made his Australian representatives appearances. Later in his career he played at fly-half.\nAustralian rugby representative.\nHe was selected in Australia's inaugural national rugby team to tour the northern hemisphere – Dr Paddy Moran's first Wallabies for the 1908–09 Australia rugby union tour of Britain. He was the youngest member of the tour squad at 20 years. Carroll played in the first Test of the tour, the 6–9 loss to Wales at Cardiff Arms Park which was the first rugby Test played by an Australian team on British soil.\nAt the time the rugby tournament for the London Olympics game may not have appeared to be of great significance. Australia had already beaten Cornwall, the British county champions early in the tour and Scotland, Ireland and France had all turned down the Rugby Football Union's invitation to participate in the Olympic bouts. Neither the tour captain Moran, nor the vice-captain Fred Wood played, so Chris McKivat led the Wallabies to an easy 32–3 victory and to Olympic glory, with each Wallaby in that match thereafter an Olympic gold medalist. Carroll scored two tries in the match.\nAt the tour's end McKivat would lead fourteen of the Wallabies into the professional ranks with the fledgling rugby league code in Sydney, but Carroll stayed loyal to the amateur game and was rewarded in 1912 when he was again selected in the Wallabies squad for the 1912 Australia rugby union tour of Canada and the United States. The tour was a disappointment with the squad billeted out in college fraternity houses where the hospitality played havoc with team discipline and as result the team lost against two California University sides and three Canadian provincial sides. They rose to the occasion for the sole Test of the tour – the November 1912 clash against the United States at Berkeley, won 12–8. Carroll played at fly-half in that match and scored a try. Carroll thus made two Test career appearances for Australia.\nAmerican rugby and war service.\nCarroll stayed on in America after the 1912 tour. He played for All-America against the All Blacks in 1913, a Test won by NZ 51–3. He served in the American Army as a lieutenant in World War I and won a Distinguished Service Cross.\nHe completed a degree in geology at Stanford University in 1920 and was coaching rugby at the university when he was selected as the playing coach of the USA side selected for the 1920 Summer Olympics. He won a gold medal at Antwerp in that team playing at fly-half. He made three rugby union Test career appearances for the United States between 1913 and 1920.\nZavos quotes an article from a local Stanford paper of 1935 which reports that Carroll played four years of rugby at Stanford and one year of American football. He won his letter in rugby in 1913, 1914 and 1915. He played his last game of rugby in 1921 when a pick-up team visited British Columbia.\nPost playing.\nAfter Stanford, Carroll furthered his education at Oxford and the Royal School of Mines in England. In 1921 he took up an appointment with Standard Oil and remained with the company until his retirement.\nCarroll married Helen Warden from Great Falls, Montana in 1927 and had one son Daniel – who is deceased. Helen died in 1941 and Carroll died in New Orleans in 1956."

        "text": "Arthur James Wilson (29 December 1886 – 31 July 1917) was a British rugby union player who competed in the 1908 Summer Olympics and represented the England national team. He was a member of the British rugby union team, which won the silver medal.\nEarly life.\nArthur Wilson was born on 29 December 1886 in Newcastle upon Tyne, the son of Henry and Emily Wilson. He attended the Glenalmond College and then the Camborne School of Mines. \nAfter qualifying as a mining engineer at the latter, he worked as such in the Gold Coast Colony (now Ghana) and as a tea planter in India.\nRugby career.\nWilson was selected to play for Cornwall on seventeen occasions. He was part of the Cornwall team that reached the County Championship final for the first time in 1908, against Durham. The match, contested on 28 March 1908 at Redruth, Cornwall, was won by Cornwall 17–3.\nIn 1908, the Olympic Games were hosted in London, and it was decided to include rugby in the event. Although several international teams had initially entered the tournament, the Home Nations were unable to decide amongst themselves who should represent the United Kingdom, and France, the previous winners, withdrew. The Wallabies were then on a tour of the Home Nations, and were the only team left. The RFU asked Cornwall, the day after Australia had beaten them 18–5, to represent the United Kingdom and to provide some opposition to Australia, rather than allow them to win by default. The match was held on 26 October. The previous day, the Cornwall team took the train to London, stopping off at Plymouth to have lunch and consume alcohol, then continued their festivities on reaching London. On the day of the match, the Cornish team took a tour of the city in the morning, followed by lunch at the Garden Club, at the invitation of the President of the Cornish Rugby Union. The match was played at White City alongside the outdoor swimming pool. Australia won the game 32–3. \"The Times\" reported \"Cornwall completely failed to find their game, their forwards executed a few good rushes but their backs, without exception, were not only too slow but were continually failing in their fielding. One expected better football from the champion county side.\" The Australian newspaper \"The Age\" remarked: \"The Cornwall forwards were good, but their backs were outpaced and beaten by the cleverness of the Australians.\" At 21 years of age, Wilson was the youngest player on the team, but Australia's Dan Carroll was younger aged 16.\nMilitary service.\nAt the start of the First World War, Wilson enlisted in the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, and was killed when serving in the 12th battalion of the Royal Fusiliers in the Battle of Pilckem Ridge, Belgium, reportedly aged 29. He is commemorated at the Menin Gate in Ypres, Belgium."

Before 1984, the three events were held in different locations on different weekends, whereafter they were combined into a single event with one rider per class.\nThe scoring for the event works on the position system, i.e. first place is awarded one point, second place two, etc. Each class (currently MXGP, MX2 and Open) races twice, each time against one of other two classes, for a total of three races. The worst score of three races is dropped, and the lowest combined score wins.\nThe event's name has been officially anglicised (as Motocross of Nations \"MXON\") since 2004, when Youthstream was awarded promotional rights for the World Motocross Grand Prix, although the general moniker Des Nations or MXDN is still very much in use. Races are streamed live on the MXGP website.\nHistorically Great Britain dominated the early years.

The head coach for the Rams is Bradley LeCroy. Significant past events are: First place CAA finishes in 1997, 1998, &amp; 2003; 2002, 2003, 2005, 2007, &amp; 2010 CAA Tournament champions, 8 NCAA Tournament appearances since 1996; and an average of 30 or more wins (56 game schedule) in each of the past 11 seasons.\nAccomplishments.\nIn 1987, VCU went 25–22 for its first winning season in school history. The next year, the Rams made their first NCAA regional appearance.\nIn 2015, VCU's 45th year of baseball, the Rams had their banner season. Led by Shawn Stiffler in his third season as head coach, the team at one point was 26–22 going into their last two conference weekends with playoff hopes diminishing if they didn't turn things around. The team went on to win 13 straight games, including the Atlantic 10 Conference Tournament held at George Washington University that year. The final play of the tournament was a diving catch by sophomore outfielder Logan Farrar that was recognized as one of the Top 10 plays. The Rams progressed to a tough regional hosted by Dallas Baptist University in Dallas, Texas that included VCU, Texas, and Oregon State. The Rams went 3–1 in the regional tournament beating Dallas Baptist three times outscoring them 12–4 and Oregon State once with a score of 5–1.

        "text": "The Polish American Football League or shortly PLFA () was a structured system for the American football competitions in Poland founded in 2004 by the Polish federation PZFA. In 2012, the Topliga was created as a major league with a bid (invitation) rule. The remaining teams are divided into two leagues (PLFA I and PLFA II) between which there was promotion and relegation. There were two eight-man football competitions: PLFA 8 for reserve teams and smaller clubs, and PLFA J for under-17 players.\nThe top four teams from the Topliga regular season entered the playoffs and the winners met in the championship game called the SuperFinał (more commonly known as the \"Polish Bowl\"). The PLFA I championship game was called the PLFA Cup Game.\nIn the 2013 season there were 74 teams in 5 leagues. 57 teams played 11-man football (8 teams in the Topliga, 8 teams in the PLFA I and 21 teams in the PLFA II) and other 37 teams played 8-man football competitions: 20 senior teams and 17 junior teams). The TopLiga and PLFA I are divided into two divisions, PLFA II into three divisions, and PLFA 8 and PLFAJ into five divisions based on geographical reasons.\nAfter the 2017 season, there was a split in Polish American football, 20 clubs left the PLFA and founded a new league, the Liga Futbolu Amerykańskiego or shortly LFA.\nHistory.\nAmerican football is arguably the fastest growing sport in Poland, which appeared in Poland in 1999, when a pioneer initiative was established in Warsaw. The Polish American Football Association ( or \"PZFA\") was created in November 2004, initiated by the first two American football teams: Warsaw Eagles and 1. KFA Wielkopolska. Its founding was a response to the dynamic growth of the American football movement in Poland.\nThe first game between Polish teams (still without professional equipment) was played in December 2005 in Poznań. The first international game, officiated by professionals, was played in March 2006 – The Warsaw Eagles took on Czech team Pardubice Stallions in a game played in Warsaw. From that moment on, teams began to be established in different parts of the country.\nThe Polish American Football League started in October 2006 with just 4 teams. There were 9 teams competing for the second championship in 2007. In 2008, the league split into two divisions - PLFA I (8 teams) and PLFA II (9 teams). There were 22 teams competing for the 2009 season and 21 for the 2010 season. 2011- 34 teams, 2012- 42 teams, and 2013- 74 teams.\nSeason structure.\nThe regular season in the Topliga starts in March/April and ends in June/July. Each team plays nine games competing against every other team in the division (4 or 5 home games and 5 or 4 away games). A team is awarded two points for a win, one point for a tie, and zero points for a loss (a tie only occurs if the overtime can not be played). \nAfter a regular season, the top four teams qualify for the play-offs (1st place against 4th place and 2nd against 3rd) and the Semi-Final winners meet in the championship game called SuperFinal; there is no 3rd place game. \nThe 2012 Super-Final championship game drew 23,000 fans.\nGame rules.\nPlaying rules are based on those of the NCAA College football with minor modifications, e.g.:\nRules are adopted with a one-year delay. For example, 2011 NCAA game rule changes was adopted for 2012 PLFA season.\nBefore 2012, coaches, players and officials used the English-language NCAA Rulebook. In February 2012, the Rulebook was translated into Polish by the Officiating Department chairman.\nExternal links.\n "

He graduated in 1988.\nProfessional career.\nTurner had a two-season stint in the NBA, with the Sacramento Kings (1989–90 and 1994–95), with little impact – he averaged 3 points and one rebound per game, in 66 regular season games combined.\nIn Europe, Turner played mainly in Italy in the top-tier Lega Basket Serie A, representing Emmezeta Udine (Italian 2nd Division), Panna Firenze (Italian 2nd Division), Ducato Siena (Jun–Oct 1998), BingoSNAI Montecatini, Müller Verona, and Adecco Milano). He also had spells in Turkey, with the Turkish League club Fenerbahçe, and in Greece, with the Greek Basket League clubs Panionios and Maroussi.\nWhile playing in Greece for Panionios during the 1993–94 season, Turner thrilled the crowds with his performances and stunning slam dunks. Both came together in one memorable first-half performance against PAOK in the semi-final of the Korać Cup. In front of a full-house of raucous Panionios fans, Turner scored 30 points in the first-half, and capped it with a 360 degree dunk that had the supporters (and game commentator) in delirium. Unfortunately for Turner and Panionios, they faded in the second-half, and lost a 20-point lead and the game, by a score of 83-85, with Turner ending up with 37 points. Nevertheless, the first half remains etched in the memory of Panionios fans, and more generally, followers of Greek basketball from that unforgettable era.\nWhile playing with Fenerbahçe, Turner was granted Turkish citizenship, and played under the name Hakkı Uzun.\nPost-playing career.\nTurner retired from playing basketball in 2002, at age 36, and went on to work as a basketball analyst for Comcast, with co-hosts Jim Kozimor, Kayte Christensen, and Lafayette Lever, covering Sacramento Kings games."

The regular season started two weeks later on 21 September with 12 teams including new additions Birmingham Panthers, Everton Tigers and London Capital the later of whom stepped up from EBL Division 1 during the summer. After just one season in the top-flight, London United were forced to drop out due to the loss of its financial backer just weeks before the start of the season.\nGuildford's participation in the ULEB Cup saw a British team return to European competition for the first time since Brighton Bears' appearance in the same competition in the 2003–04 season. Out of their depth, the Heat finished their European adventure with a 0–10 record.\nOn the domestic scene Guildford continued their dominance, collecting the Cup Winners' Cup, BBL Trophy and the Play-off crown. Newcastle Eagles were Champions of the League's regular season campaign, whilst rookie teams Everton and London ended with respectable 7th and 9th-place finishes. The League also secured a live broadcasting contract with Setanta Sports midway through the campaign which saw one televised game a week screened on live on their network.\nCup Winners' Cup.\nThe 2007–08 season saw the inauguration of the BBL's newest competition, the Cup Winners' Cup. The pre-season event between last season's winners of the BBL Cup and BBL Trophy was staged over two legs with the winner determined by the final aggregate score.\nGuildford Heat claimed the upper-hand in the first leg away to Plymouth Raiders with an 83–77 victory, despite being ahead by 18-points, Raiders kept fighting and eventually clawed the game back before losing in the final minutes.\nThe second leg in Guildford was an equally tight affair, but Heat's strength combined with Raiders' poor free-throw shooting, gave them a 93–91 victory, tallying up to a 176–168 win on aggregate.\nBBL Cup.\nFor the 2007–08 edition of the BBL Cup, the top three ranking teams from last season's BBL Championship – Guildford Heat, Sheffield Sharks and Newcastle Eagles – plus the Milton Keynes Lions, all received a bye into the Quarter-final, leaving the remaining eight clubs to battle it out in the First Round.\nBBL Trophy.\nThis season's BBL Trophy was slightly reformatted from the previous edition of the tournament. The first round comprised three groups of three and one group of four. Gone were the lower league clubs for the English Basketball League and Scottish Basketball League, with the exception of the previous year's EBL Division 1 champions Worthing Thunder, who stepped in to fill the spot vacated by London United, who withdrew prior to the season opener.\nEach team played each other twice, once home and once away, and after each group campaign is completed, the top team from each group advanced into the semi-finals. If teams tied on points (2 for a win, 0 for a loss), head-to-head results would come into play.\nGroup stage.\nGroup 1\nGroup 2\nGroup 3\nGroup 4\nFinal.\nThe Final for this season's BBL Trophy was held on 2 March 2008, at the Pavilions in Plymouth, the first time the venue has hosted a major final. It was a 'North-South' final contested between Newcastle Eagles and Guildford Heat, and was broadcast live on television, on Setanta Sports 2, and also BBC Radio Newcastle.\nNewcastle had been leading 47–35 at the half, but a Guildford comeback led by Most Valuable Player E. J. Harrison and Daniel Gilbert, overhauled the Eagles for their first trophy of the season, after the league and cup double of last season. Harrison scored 10 of his 25 points in the closing quarter with Gilbert scoring 3 in the last minute to cement the trophy for the Heat. Lynard Stewart led all scorers in the match with 26 points, but this was not enough for Newcastle as Fabulous Flournoy's men went down in their second consecutive final after losing to Milton Keynes Lions in the BBL Cup final."

The next 2 seasons saw Millar split time between the Oilers and their minor league affiliate Hamilton Bulldogs.\nPrior to the 1999–2000 season, Millar was traded to the Nashville Predators for a 3rd round draft pick (which would turn out to be Mike Comrie). That year he enjoyed his best NHL season, appearing in 57 games and scoring 14 points. The following season Millar played part of the year in the minors and 5 games with the Predators before being released. He was picked up by the Tampa Bay Lightning and played 16 games with the team.\nFor the 2001–02 season Millar played briefly in Germany and Slovakia before retiring in 2002."

        "title": "Cricket in World War I",
        "text": "Cricket in World War I was severely curtailed in all nations where first-class cricket was then played except India. In England, South Africa and the West Indies, first-class cricket was entirely abandoned for the whole of the war, whilst in Australia and New Zealand regular competitions were played for the 1914–15 season but first-class matches were afterwards abandoned. In South Africa, first-class cricket did not recommence until a series of matches against the Australian Imperial Forces cricket team in late 1919, and provincial cricket was not played until a one-off match between Transvaal and Natal in April 1920.\nAt least 210 first-class cricketers are known to have joined the armed forces, of whom 34 were killed. The obituary sections of Wisden between 1915 and 1919 contained the names of hundreds of players and officials of all standards who died in the service of their country.\nAbandonment of first-class cricket.\nWith war looming in August, cricketers with military commitments, such as Sir Archibald White, the Yorkshire skipper, left their teams to do their duty, and Pelham Warner and Arthur Carr, who captained Middlesex and Nottinghamshire respectively, followed when war was declared. The County Championship was not immediately abandoned, the MCC issuing a statement that \"no good purpose can be saved at the moment by cancelling matches\" on 6 August, but attendances plummeted. Jack Hobbs, who had scored a career best 226 in front of over 14,000 spectators on 3 August, had to rearrange his benefit match from the Oval, after it was requisitioned by the Army, to Lord's and on 13 August the MCC announced that all matches arranged at Lord's up to September would be postponed.\nNews of casualties suffered by the British Expeditionary Force in Belgium was already turning the public mood against \"business as usual\" and on 27 August a letter written by W. G. Grace was published in \"The Sportsman\" in which he declared that \"I think the time has arrived when the county cricket season should be closed, for it is not fitting at a time like this that able-bodied men should be playing cricket by day and pleasure-seekers look on. I should like to see all first-class cricketers of suitable age set a good example and come to the help of their country without delay in its hour of need.\"\nThe remaining matches in the Championship were abandoned \"in deference to public opinion\" while the MCC closed the Scarborough Festival as \"the continuation of first-class cricket is hurtful to the feelings of a section of the public\". The last match to be completed, on 2 September, pitted Sussex against Yorkshire at Hove. \"The men's hearts were barely in the game\", the periodical \"Cricket\" reported at the time, \"and the match was given up as a draw at tea.\" The last match played, twenty five years and a day later, before the abandonment of first-class cricket due to World War II saw the same teams facing each other on the same ground.\nW. G. Grace, who had called for the early abandonment of cricket in his letter to \"The Sportsman\", was reputed to shake his fist at the Zeppelins floating over his South London home. When chided by a friend who pointed out that the fast bowling of Ernie Jones had not discomforted him half so much, Grace replied testily \"But I could SEE him!\" Grace had played his second-last match, at the age of 66, for Eltham against Grove Park on 25 July 1914, scoring an unbeaten 69 out of 155 for six declared. He died of a stroke on 23 October 1915.\nCricket continues.\nWhile first-class cricket had been cancelled in the major cricketing nations, cricket itself continued around the world. In England, the Oval and Lord's hosted a number of matches between representative services sides, Army regiments and other service units. Club cricket continued, especially in the north of England, where the Lancashire League played in each summer without a break.\nGeese were kept on the grass at Lord's while the pavilion at Old Trafford was transformed into a Red Cross hospital. In four years, 1,800 patients were treated there, with beds occupying every possible space, including corridors and stairway landings.\nAnzac soldiers played improvised games cricket under shellfire on Shell Green in Gallipoli in 1915. The Australians played a game in view of the Turks to give the impression of normality and confidence while the entire force was being secretly evacuated from the beach area.\nRobert Graves recounts a game between officers and sergeants at Vermelles in France in 1915, when a bird cage with a dead parrot inside was used as the wicket. The game was abandoned when German machine gun fire at an aeroplane caused falling bullets to land dangerously close to the pitch.\nCricket was played overseas, often in fund raising matches. A game involving an English XII against an Indian team held at the Bombay Gymkhana in December 1915 for war relief was watched by 40,000 people. J. G. Greig scored 216 and Frank Tarrant took 9 for 35.\nThe only first-class cricketer to be awarded the Victoria Cross was John Smyth, for conspicuous gallantry with the 15th Ludhiana Sikhs in India in 1915. He also received the Military Cross and was decorated by the Russians. He played his 2 matches for the Europeans at Lahore, making 3 and 19 in the first and taking a wicket while posting 51 and 27 in the second. He was invalided out the army in the Second World War and became a Conservative MP, being created a Baronet in 1955 and a Privy Counsellor in 1962.\nCricket raised funds in other ways. George Robey, the \"Prime Minister of Mirth\", auctioned cricket memorabilia, including bats used by W.G. Grace, to raise funds for St. Dunstan's Hostel for Blind Servicemen.\nSome cricket was still played in England, with the Australian Imperial Forces, featuring Charlie Macartney, playing an English Army XI at Lord's in July 1917. Lord's was also the scene for a baseball match between American and Canadian teams watched by 10,000 with the proceeds going to the Canadian Widows and Orphans Fund. Club cricket continued to the extent that it could, with large crowds attending the matches.\nLord Harris, captain of England in the first English Test natch in 1880, took part in a match at Lord's in 1918 between Plum Warner's XI and the Public Schools. His Lordship, aged 67, scored 11 before being run out.\nWith the war drawing to a close King George V watched England play the Dominions at Lord's in 1918. The Dominions opened their batting with South African Herbie Taylor and Australian Charlie Macartney.\n\"Doing their bit\".\n210 first-class cricketers enlisted in the armed services, and others undertook war related work in support of the war effort. Taking Surrey as an example, Ernie Hayes, Bill Hitch and Andy Sandham joined the Sportsman's Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers while fast bowler Neville Knox became a private in the Public Schools Battalion. Herbert Strudwick, the Surrey wicket-keeper, worked in a South London munitions plant alongside teammate Razor Smith. Other cricketers helped in the recruitment drive, with Gilbert Jessop, promoted to the rank of captain in the 14th Service Battalion, Manchester Regiment, making speeches encouraging men to join up.\nJohn Philip Wilson.\nJack Wilson played 9 matches for Yorkshire County Cricket Club, and a couple for HDG Leveson-Gower's XI in 1912 and 1913. He then turned his hand to flying, gaining his pilot's license on a Vickers biplane at Brooklands in June 1914. He was commissioned into the Royal Naval Air Service when war broke out and flew missions throughout the war. In April 1915 he and another officer 'observed two submarines lying alongside the Mole at Zeebrugge' and 'attacked them, dropping four bombs, it was believed with successful results.' On 7 June the same year the Admiralty reported that 'this morning at 2.30 am, an attack was made on the airship shed at Evere, north of Brussels, by Flight-Lieutenants J. P. Wilson RN and J. S. Mills RN. Bombs were dropped and the shed was observed to be in flames. It is not known whether a zeppelin was inside, but the flames reached a great height, coming out from both three sides of the shed. Both pilots returned safely.'\nA few days later, on 21 June, the Admiralty announced that HM King had been graciously pleased to award the Distinguished Service Cross to both Wilson and Mills 'for their services on 7 June 1915, when after a long flight in darkness over hostile territory, they threw bombs on the zeppelin shed at Evere near Brussels, and destroyed a zeppelin which was inside. The two officers were exposed to heavy anti-aircraft fire during the attack' (London Gazette 21 June 1915).\nAt the Yorkshire AGM in 1916, Lord Hawke said of Wilson, \"May he continue his splendid work, and be with us when we again resume hostilities on the cricket field:\" In the county yearbook for that year there is a photograph of him dressed in naval uniform. He was also awarded the Belgian Order of the Crown (LG 29 August 1917), and in the New Year's Honours for 1919 he was awarded the AFC, \"in recognition of distinguished service\" (LG 1 January 1919).\nIn a conflict when the average survival time for R.F.C. pilots could be counted in hours, Wilson was promoted to major, survived the war and died on 3 October 1959 in Tickton, Beverley, Yorkshire. His other claims to fame include winning the Grand National on 'Double Chance' in 1925.\nCricket in war art.\nCricket was used as a theme in cartoons highlighting the \"Hun's unsportsmanlike attitude to war\". J.H. Dowd's \"The Kaiser's Cricket\" depicted a spike-helmeted German soldier playing cricket in a most underhand way. He is shown catching a ball in the field with a net, hitting an umpire with a bat, batting with a net in front of his stumps, pushing a batsman out of his crease before stumping him and bowling a ball from the middle of the pitch.\nC. M. Padday's painting of Royal Navy sailors playing cricket on deck \"somewhere in the tropics\" shows a ball made of twine attached to wickets made of buckets for easy retrieval when it was hit over the side.\nA \"Punch\" cartoon depicted the Germans in more lighthearted manner in a cartoon which showed a German plane flying over a cricket match. The game continues, even as the plane drops its bombs, with the fielders chasing a ball to the boundary. The caption, playing on the German misunderstanding of cricket, shows the German airman's report as saying \"We dropped bombs on a British formation, causing the troops to disperse and run about in a panic stricken manner\".\nThe fear of poison gas attacks spreading to England saw the British Government warn citizens to take their gas masks everywhere in 1916, just in case. Essex cricketer and journalist Edward Sewell was photographed in full cricket gear wearing his mask.\nGrenades and bowling techniques.\nBritish and Empire soldiers were instructed to throw the Mills bomb, a hand-held fragmentation grenade using a technique similar to that of bowling a cricket ball. Training classes were given on how to best do this. A cartoon satirising this was published by Geoffrey Stobie in 1918. The image has two panes; in the left pane, a cricketer is about to deliver the ball, his left arm out in front of him and his right vertically down behind his back holding the ball. In the right pane, this position is mirrored by a soldier, but rather than a cricket ball, he is holding a grenade in his right hand.\nThe No. 15 Ball grenade was referred to as the 'cricket ball' grenade. It was ignited by striking the grenade like a match before throwing it at the enemy. It proved unreliable, as it was susceptible to the damp, and was withdrawn after the Battle of Loos.\nCasualties.\nOther cricketers were seriously wounded in the fighting, which in many cases had a serious effect on their cricketing careers.\nA changed game.\nThe County Championship resumed in England in 1919, with the counties agreeing to a brief and unsuccessful experiment with two-day county matches. It was not only the playing ranks which had been thinned by four years of slaughter. Worcestershire County Cricket Club mounted a roll of honour, in the form of a wooden plaque, in the pavilion at New Road to list and remember the 17 members of the club who died in the Great War. It is still at the club."

        "title": "Rugby union gameplay",
        "text": "Rugby union is a contact sport that consists of two teams of fifteen players. The objective is to obtain more points than the opposition through scoring \"tries\" or kicking goals over eighty minutes of playing time. The play is started with one team drop-kicking the ball from the halfway line towards the opposition. The rugby ball can be moved up the field by either carrying it or kicking it. However, when passing the ball it can only be thrown laterally or backward. The opposition can stop players moving up the field by tackling them. Only players carrying the ball can be tackled and once a tackle is completed the opposition can compete for the ball. Play continues until a try is scored, the ball crosses the side line or dead-ball line, or an infringement occurs. After a team scores points, the non-scoring team restarts the game at the halfway with a drop kick toward the opposition. The team with the most points at the end wins the game.\nTypical gameplay.\nA typical passage of rugby union takes the following form. Unlike rugby league and gridiron football, possession of the ball in rugby union is contestable at any time by both teams – there is no separate 'offense' and 'defense'. The team which has possession of the ball at any given time will normally try to keep it, while the other team will try to recapture it, or at least deny the team in possession the chance to attack and/or force it to kick the ball away or commit an error. One team will initially gain possession of the ball, either from the kick-off, a restart kick or a set piece (scrum and line-out). The need to maintain possession means the team with the ball will usually seek to progress towards the opposition by running forward while carrying the ball; although if there are few opportunities to attack they may choose to kick the ball forward, from the hand, usually giving it back to the opposition but in a position from where it will be difficult to attack. The ball may be thrown from one player to another (passing) but must not be thrown forward, that is towards the opposition dead-ball line. Any teammate ahead of the ball-carrier is offside and must not interfere with play. So American football-style blocking is forbidden, although tackling or obstructing a player who does not have the ball is against the laws anyway, whether or not the tackling player is offside. The team not in possession attempts to stop the ball-carrier by grabbing and bringing them to ground (a tackle). A tackled player, once having been brought to ground, must immediately pass or release the ball, allowing the two teams to contest possession of the loose ball; if the attacking player is tackled but the tackler releases the ball carrier the ball carrier may get up and continue the play. Play does not stop unless there is an infringement of the Laws, the ball/ball-carrier leaves the field of play, the ball becomes unplayable after a tackle, or the attacking team scores points by either touching the ball over the goal-line (a try) or drop-kicking the ball over the crossbar. If the ball or ball-carrier goes into touch (out of the field of play), the game restarts with a line-out. If the game stops due to an infringement, play restarts with either a scrum, free kick or penalty kick (depending on the nature of the infringement) to the non-infringing team.\nRunning.\nPlayers can run with the ball in any direction they want. However they cannot use a teammate to obstruct the opposition. This occurs when they run around or into one of their own players and in the process prevent a defender from tackling them. Defending teams can also run anywhere they want as long as they do not start from an offside position. Offside lines are behind the last foot at a ruck, maul or tackle or five and ten metres back from scrums and lineouts respectively. If the ball is kicked, players from the kicking team cannot run forward until they have been passed by the kicker or someone behind the kicker.\nForwards tend to run straight and hard at the opposition, while the backs run at gaps between players or use speed and guile to run around them. In modern games of rugby some backs can be as big as forwards and attempt to break through the defensive line using brute force and many forwards possess the running skills of backs. Players run straight at the opposition with the aim of either breaking the tackle or getting forward momentum from which to set up another attack. If they are close to the try line they can drive in low to aid grounding the ball. Players can also try to break through tackles by spinning after making contact or by using the hand not carrying the ball to fend (push) off the defender.\nA player could also try to get around a defender by stepping, swerving, or goose-stepping past them. To sidestep a defender, the attacking player takes a wide step in one direction while running forward and then shifts their body weight in the opposite direction. If successful the defender will be off balance, allowing the attacker to accelerate past. When swerving, an attacker runs straight at the defender, but before making contact accelerates and sways to the outside. Although similar to a side step, the swerve involves less sideways movement, but results in less loss of speed. The goose-step is a move made famous by David Campese and involves slowing down while running on the outside of the opponent, causing them to also slow, before accelerating away.\nPassing.\nThe ball can be passed laterally or backwards, but cannot be thrown forward. The opposing team is awarded a scrum if the ball is unintentionally thrown forward or if it is knocked forward from a player's hand or arm – although doing so deliberately results in a penalty. An exception is if a player knocks the ball forward in attempting to block an opponent's kick – a 'charge down'. Passing is an integral part of rugby union, as it allows the ball to be easily and quickly distributed to teammates. The backs are the major participants of passes, and they are used to put running players into space. If a team has an overlap – more players attacking than the other team has defending at a particular moment – then the tactic is to draw a defending player to the tackle and pass to the person outside him. If every player executes the 'draw and pass', given space, the outside players may have no defenders in front of them.\nAnother tactic is pretending to pass the ball, called 'dummying'. It can be used during normal backline play or as part of a set move. The aim of the dummy is to confuse the opposition and create a gap for the player carrying the ball. When used as a set move a player will run as a decoy, usually at a different angle to the rest of the players. In complicated moves there will be multiple players acting as decoys. Care must be taken to ensure the decoys do not impede the tacklers, which would result in a penalty being awarded to the defenders.\nThe standard rugby pass is the spiral pass, where the player swings the ball across his body with the tip point upwards and the ball spinning about its axis. This technique propels the ball quickly and accurately. 'Quick hands' is the rapid movement of the ball between players, and at its best involves catching and passing the ball in one motion. A 'skip-pass' is a basic move where the ball is passed past the closest player to another further away. The 'double-around' is another simple move that involves the passer quickly running around the player to whom he has just passed the ball and then receiving the ball back from him. If successful it can create an overlap. Another common passing move is the 'cut and switch', which is used to change the direction of the play. For a cut the ball carrier runs laterally across the field before passing the ball to a player running back on an angle; the switch is a simple change of direction: a player standing on one side of a scrum, ruck or maul receives the ball and then passes it to someone on the opposite side.\nThere are also some specialised passes that can be used during a rugby game. The 'dive-pass' is a pass which is sometimes used by the scrum-half if he is unable to get into the correct position for a long pass. The player dives as he releases the ball, resulting in a quick pass. A 'flick-pass' is similar to a standard pass except the ball is passed with a flick of the wrists, making it a faster pass but with less distance. The 'pop-pass' is a short pass where the ball is simply popped up in a small loop to a player. The 'gut-pass' is a pass straight into the stomach area of a player and is mostly used by the forwards when moving the ball back through a maul.\nKicking.\nThe ball can be kicked in any direction and is used as an attacking option or to gain territory. There are three types of kicks used; the punt, drop kick and place kick. To punt the ball the player must kick the ball before it touches the ground. A drop kick occurs if the ball first bounces on the ground before being kicked. With a place kick the ball must be placed on the ground (usually on a kicking tee or in sand) before being kicked. Slight variations that commonly occur are taps, when a player kicks the ball a very short distance and regathers it, and toe-throughs, when a player kicks the ball along the ground instead of diving on it or picking it up.\nPunts are the most common type of kick employed by players. They are used as clearing kicks, especially if a team is close to their own goal-line or is looking to gain territory. With these kicks the player tries to kick the ball as far as possible towards the opponents goal and they usually aim for one of the touch lines. If the ball crosses the touch line before being touched by anyone a lineout is awarded to the opposing team. If the ball is put inside the player's 22-metre line by a member of the opposition they can kick the ball out on the full and gain ground. Otherwise ground is only gained if the ball bounces in the field of play before crossing the touch line. Care has to be taken not to kick it too far, because if it travels through their opponents in-goal and becomes dead the opposition is awarded a scrum from where the kick occurred. The disadvantage of \"kicking for territory\" is that it almost always gives possession of the ball to the opposing team. If a clearing kick is caught by the opposition, then they can counter-attack by running, passing, or kicking the ball back toward the clearing team.\nAttacking kicks are also employed, usually if the opposition is out of position or running at them is proving ineffective. Common attacking kicks include the \"up and under\", box kick, \"grubber\", crossfield kick and chip kick. The up and under, also known as a \"bomb\" or \"Garryowen\", is a high punt. A well executed up and under will be high enough to give anyone chasing enough time to compete for the ball. Box kicks are similar, but are kicked by the scrum-half over their shoulder when a ruck, maul, scrum or line-out occurs near the touchline. The ball is kicked high and parallel to the touchline with the wingers chasing. If the ball is kicked along the ground it is called a grubber. It can catch the defenders unaware and because the ball is oval shaped it does not bounce consistently, making it hard for them to collect it. A cross field kick occurs when the ball is kicked from one touchline to a player waiting near the other one. Chip kicks are short kicks just behind the defensive line for attacking players to run onto. Like defensive kicks there is still a risk that the opposition will regain possession after an attacking kick.\nDrop kicks are used to start play at the beginning of each half or restart play after points have been scored or the ball is grounded in the in-goal by a defending team. The ball is either kicked long to gain as much territory as possible or short so that the chasers have a chance to regain possession. A shot at goal can also be attempted using a drop goal. This can happen anytime during general play, except after a free kick has been awarded. As a missed drop goal gives possession to the opposition they are generally only attempted in close games to either gain the lead or to push the score beyond a converted try.\nPlace kicks are only ever used for attempting shots at goal after a penalty has been awarded or when converting a try. Generally one player in the team is the designated goal kicker, although some teams use a stronger, but less accurate, kicker for long shots. In close games the difference between winning or losing can come down to the accuracy of the goal kicker, making them a vital part of any team. The difficulty of a kick at goal increases with distance and angle to the goal posts, with kicks from near the sideline especially difficult. A conversion is taken back in line from the spot where the try was scored, so if possible a scorer will aim to down the ball as close to the goal posts as possible.\nKicking the ball is generally considered the sole preserve of the backs. Exceptions include flanker John Taylor, lock John Eales and number eight Zinzan Brooke, who have all scored points from kicks.\nBreakdowns.\nThe aim of the defending side is to stop the player with the ball, either by bringing them to ground (a tackle, which is frequently followed by a ruck), or by contesting for possession with the ball-carrier on their feet (a maul). Such a circumstance is called a breakdown and each is governed by a specific law.\nTackle.\nA player may tackle an opposing player who has the ball by bringing them to ground. Once tackled, a player must immediately release the ball, either by passing to a teammate or placing it on the ground, and the tackler must release them and move away. After the ball has been released by a tackled player, players from either side may try to take possession of the ball. Tacklers cannot tackle above the sternum (the neck and head are out of bounds), and the tackler has to attempt to wrap their arms around the player being tackled to complete the tackle. It is illegal to push, shoulder-charge, or to trip a player using feet or legs, but hands may be used (this being referred to as a tap-tackle or ankle-tap). Tackles that involve lifting a player and then forcing or dropping them to the ground head first (called a tip tackle or spear tackle) have been deemed particularly dangerous. A player performing this sort of tackle would typically be sent-off.\nTackling is the only way to stop a player from running and is a major part of any team's defence. A good tackle stops the player from moving forward and prevents them from passing the ball. It can also put an opponent under pressure and force the ball loose. There are five styles of tackles commonly used by players: the side, rear, passive front, active front and smother. The aim of the active front tackle is to drive the opponent backwards, while the smother tackle prevents the opposing player passing the ball. Once the player has been brought to ground, the tackler typically tries to get to their feet quickly and compete for the ball. Other players arriving at the tackle will also compete for the ball.\nThe main objective of the player being tackled is to keep possession of the ball. They will try to keep on their feet until teammates arrive in support. If brought to ground, they can immediately pass the ball (offload) or place it on the ground in a position advantageous to their team. The supporting teammates can continue running the ball or form a ruck or maul.\nRuck.\nA ruck is formed when at least one player from each side bind onto each other with the ball on the ground between them. A ruck often ensues following a tackle. This physical contact, or binding, is generally by locking shoulders while facing each other. Additional players may join the ruck, but must do so from behind the rearmost foot of the hindmost teammate in the ruck; this is often referred to as \"coming through the gate\". If players do not go \"through the gate\", it is a penalty to the opposition (“joining from the side” or “in at the side”). Any player not taking part in the ruck and maul must retreat behind the \"offside line\", a notional line that runs parallel to the goal-lines through the rearmost foot of their hindmost teammate in the ruck or maul.\nIn a ruck, no player may use their hands to win the ball; instead each side attempts to push the other side off the ball or use their feet to hook it back towards their own side; an action known as \"rucking\".\nPlayers attempt to arrive at the ruck first, drive forward and bind onto the opposition. Once a ruck is formed the defenders cannot use their hands, making it easier for the attacking team to retain possession. The defenders try to slow the ball from coming out of the ruck, which allows their team more time to organise their defence. This may not be done by using their hands, or lying over the ball, or going to ground deliberately. Such infringements result in penalties if seen by the referee, although the number of bodies involved in the ruck can make this difficult. A legal method used to slow the ball down is counter-rucking, when the defenders drive players back over the ball. If this is done well, the defenders can gain possession of the ball. This is called a turnover.\nA drive around a ruck or a scrum is usually performed by the forwards and is intended to break the defensive line using weight and force. The ball-carrier runs directly at the opponents and will endeavour to protect the ball so as to retain possession when contact occurs. This play, often referred to as a \"pick-up-and-drive\", usually offers a slow but sure advance. Sometimes the tactical aim is to suck defenders into a ruck or maul, opening gaps in the defensive line for the backs to exploit. It is also often employed in the closing minutes of the game by the team that has the lead, because it is an effective way of retaining possession and running down the clock.\nThe ball emerges from a maul more slowly than from a ruck.\nWorld Rugby announced in 2017 that it would add a major change to the laws governing the ruck among an ongoing series of global law trials. Under this trial law amendment, a ruck is formed \"when at least one player is on their feet and over the ball which is on the ground.\" At this moment, the offside lines are set. A player on his or her feet (typically the tackler) can use hands to pick up the ball if the action is immediate, but once an opposing player arrives at the ruck, no hands can be used. Additionally, kicking the ball out of a ruck is explicitly penalised, with only hooking \"in a backwards motion\" allowed. The trial was used for several international competitions in 2017, among them the World Under 20 Championship, before taking effect in the Northern Hemisphere on 1 August 2017 and in the Southern Hemisphere from 1 January 2018. All of these amendments were approved unanimously by the World Rugby Council and added to the laws of the game in 2018. \nMaul.\nA maul occurs when a player carrying the ball is held by one or more opponents, and one or more of the ball carrier's teammates bind on the ball carrier. Once a maul has formed other players may join in but, as in a ruck, they must do so from their own side by going through the middle or through the top as long as the maul is stationary. If the maul stops moving forward, and the ball is not available to be played, then the referee awards a scrum to the side not in possession when the maul began (unless the maul was formed immediately after a player received a kick other than a kick-off). The tactic of the rolling maul occurs when mauls are set up, and the ball is passed backwards through the players' hands to one at the rear, who rolls off the side to change the direction of the drive. This tactic can be extremely effective in gaining ground and both doing it properly and preventing it takes great skill and technique. It is a tactic most commonly used when the attacking side is inside the defending side's 22 meter line.\nIt was once illegal on safety grounds to pull down a maul, causing the players to fall to the ground. With the introduction of the Experimental Law Variations it was permitted to pull down a maul if the forward momentum of the attacking side had been neutralised or reversed, subject to maintaining safety. This decision was reversed to make the pulling down of a maul illegal once more.\nOn the other hand, a maul is not properly formed if the ball carrier binds on to a teammate from the rear, and both of them then drive into one or more opponents – or if the ball-carrier breaks off from the back of the maul, which continues to drive forward. The players in front are either accidentally or deliberately offside and the referee awards either a scrum or a penalty to the opposing side, depending on whether the infringement was viewed as accidental or deliberate.\nThe tactic is sometimes referred to by players, commentators, and referees by the colloquial term \"truck and trailer\".\nRestart kicks.\n Play is started at the beginning of each half by a kick-off. One side—determined following the toss of a coin—takes a drop kick from the middle of the halfway line to start the half. The ball must travel at least 10 m into the opposition half. None of the kicking team's players are allowed in front of the player taking the kick until after that player's foot has touched the ball. The kicking side frequently kicks the ball high and for it to go just over 10 m, which is marked by a dashed line across the pitch. This tactic gives their players time to chase the lobbed ball and hope to catch it before the opposition does. Alternatively the kick may be a long kick deep into opposition territory, sacrificing the chance to regain possession for territorial gain. A restart kick that does not cross the 10 m line can either be played by the receiving team, but not by the kicking team, or a midfield scrum is awarded to the receiving team. A restart kick that crosses the side lines without being touched awards the receiving team either a midfield scrum or a line out on the halfway line, receiving team option.\nSimilarly, there is also a 22 m drop-out. This is awarded if the attacking side is responsible for sending the ball into the in-goal area, but instead of their player grounding the ball and scoring a try it is first grounded by a defender. If the ball is kicked into the in-goal area by the attackers and instead of being grounded there by either side it continues, under its own momentum, through the in-goal area and crosses the dead-ball line, then the defenders have the option of choosing either a 22 m drop out or a scrum at the place where the attackers kicked the ball. The 22 m drop out is taken at any point along (or behind) the 22 m line.\nPenalty kicks and free kicks.\nPenalty kicks are awarded for dangerous play. A penalty kick may either be used to attempt a penalty goal, kick into touch (either directly or indirectly, in both cases the kicking team throws-in the ball at the ensuing line-out) or tapped with the foot (giving the kicking player possession of the ball). In each case, the opponents must retire to a distance 10 m from the point at which the penalty is awarded.\nA free kick is awarded for technical infringements that do not warrant a penalty. A free kick differs from a penalty in that it cannot be used for an attempt at goal. If the ball goes into touch, the kicking team does not receive the throw at the ensuing lineout. When kicked directly into touch (i.e. without bouncing) there is no gain in ground from the free kick unless it was taken from behind the kicking team's 22-metre line.\nA free kick is also awarded when a player catches an opponent's kick on or behind his own 22 m line and shouts the word \"mark\".\nScrum.\nA scrum is a way of restarting the game safely and fairly after a minor infringement. It is awarded when the ball has been knocked or passed forward, when a player is accidentally offside, or when the ball is trapped in a ruck or maul with no realistic chance of being retrieved. A team may also opt for a scrum if awarded a penalty. It is also awarded to the passing or kicking team if the ball hits the referee.\nA scrum is formed by the eight forwards from each team binding together in three rows. The front row consists of the two props (loosehead and tighthead) either side of the hooker. The second row consists of two locks and the two flankers. Behind the second row is the number 8. This formation is known as the 3–4–1 formation. The two packs of forwards engage with each other so that the heads of the front-rowers are interlocked with those of their opponents. Front-rowers always aim for the gap to the left (as they see it) of their opponent. The two locks in the second row bind directly behind the front row with their heads between a prop and the hooker. The flankers bind either side of the locks, and the number 8 binds behind and between the two locks.\nOnce a scrum is formed the scrum-half from the team awarded the \"feed\" throws the ball into the gap between the two front-rows known as the \"tunnel\". The two hookers then compete for possession by hooking the ball backwards with their feet, while each pack tries to push the opposing pack backwards to help gain possession. The side that wins possession transfers the ball to the back of the scrum, where it is picked up either by the number 8 or by the scrum-half. Either the scrum half or the number 8 can then pass, run, or kick the ball and normal play then resumes. A scrum has to be awarded between the lines along the goal-lines and touch-lines. A team may also score a pushover try from a scrum; once the ball has crossed the goal-line during a scrum an attacking player may legally ground it.\nScrums are one of the most dangerous phases in rugby, since a collapse or improper engage can lead to a front row player damaging or even breaking his neck. For this reason, only trained players may play in the front row to help avoid injuries. If a team is without sufficient specialist front row players, for example because of injury or sin-binning, all scrums may be \"uncontested scrums\". In this situation, the packs engage, but do not push, and the team that still puts the ball into the scrum must win it without effort.\nLine-out.\nWhen the ball goes into touch (i.e. outside of the area of play) the referee calls a line-out at the point where the ball crossed the touchline. There are two exceptions for this rule:\nThe forwards of each team (though not necessarily all of them, their number is throwing-in team option) line up a metre apart, perpendicular to the touchline and between 5 m and 15 m from the touchline. The ball is thrown from the touchline down the centre of the lines of forwards by a player (usually the hooker) from the team that did not play the ball into touch. The exception to this is when the ball went out from a penalty, in which case the side who gained the penalty throws the ball in. There is an advantage to being the team throwing the ball as that team then knows where along the line the throw is aimed. If the ball passes over the 15 m line, it can be played by everyone and the line-out is over; if the ball is not thrown straight down the middle of the line-out, the non-infringing team may choose to have the put-in to either a new line-out or a scrum 15 m infield.\nBoth sides compete for the ball, and some players may lift their teammates. (While the laws say that jumping players may only be supported, lifting is uniformly tolerated under specified conditions). A jumping player cannot be tackled until they stand and only shoulder-to-shoulder contact is allowed; deliberate infringement of this Law is dangerous play, and results in a penalty kick, and frequently a trip to the sin bin. If a penalty kick is awarded during a line-out and the line out is not over, it is taken 15 m from the touch line."

The club was founded in 1841, making it the second-oldest cricket club in Tasmania, and the second-oldest cricket club in Australia.\nLCC beat Derwent Cricket Club by 12 runs in the first-ever \"north v south\" match in 1850, and on 11 February and 12 February 1851, they played against Melbourne Cricket Club in Launceston, in what is now recorded as the first ever first-class cricket match in Australia. By 1874 the LCC had organised the first ever \"All-England XI\" vs \"Tasmania\" game in Launceston on 24 February.\nIn 1878 LCC player, George Bailey was selected to join the Australian cricket team on their tour to England, and became the first Tasmanian to play for Australia.\nThe club took possession of the NTCA Ground, then known as the \"Launceston Cricket Ground\" in 1886 upon the formation of the NTCA. At the time, the club colours were listed as Green and Yellow. The following year LCC won the inaugural NTCA premiership.\nFrom 1907 until 1914 the club was in recess due to political bickering and reorganisation of the NTCA and northern district cricket competitions. The club was reformed in 1914 with changed colours of Oxford Blue only to have the league suspended for the outbreak of World War I. However, the club properly returned to the NTCA in 1918 by winning the premiership again.\nThe club won three premierships in a row by 1922 but again went into recess due to another period of district cricket from 1935–36 to 1940–41.\nLaunceston Cricket Club and East Launceston Cricket Club merged in 1941 before rejoining the NTCA competition. At this time, the club also adopted their current club colours of red and green.\nIn 1968 club legend Ron 'Rocky' Dean retired from Tasmanian Grade Cricket with a remarkable career haul of 901 wickets.\nIn 1975 LCC won their first Kookaburra Cup, and in 1978, LCC player, Bruce Doolan faces Tasmania's first ball in their debut Sheffield Shield match. 1979 saw the club win three Kookaburra Cups in a row.\nThe 1981–82 season saw LCC amass a then-competition record of 7/527 in the NTCA final. From the 1982–83 season until 1985–86 the club won every NTCA premiership, a remarkable 4 in a row.\nIn the 1983–84 season David Boon became the first Launceston Cricket Club player to be selected to play for Australia, and in 1991 he was honoured to unveil a plaque at the NTCA ground commemorating the club's 150th anniversary.\nFrom 1988–89 until 1993–94 LCC won an incredible 6 Consecutive NTCA Premierships, which is both an NTCA and State Record, including a record innings and 150 runs victory over rivals South Launceston Cricket Club in the 1994 final.\nThe 1998 NTCA final between LCC and Mowbray Cricket Club proved to be one of the most remarkable games of cricket in Tasmanian history. Mowbray amassed an incredible record of 7/542, in doing so breaking Launceston's record from 1982. Even more incredibly, the following week in reply LCC made 6/545 to win the game by 4 wickets and break the record again. Club legend Richard 'Joey' Bennett retired with a club record 8640 runs to his name.\nThe following Grand Final between LCC and Riverside Cricket Club proved to match the previous years when on the last day, Riverside were cruising to a comfortable victory until the last hour of the match when LCC took six wickets, including two in the second last over from 16-year-old Xavier Doherty to win the game\nIn 1999, Australian cricket legend David Boon played his last ever match for Launceston CC, and the following year 4 LCC players were named in the NTCA \"team of the century\".\nThe 2020–21 season saw the club complete a clean sweep of the men's competition, winning the First, Second and Third Grade competitions.\nHonours.\nNTCA Premierships: 1887–88, 1892–93, 1899–1900, 1901–02, 1902–03, 1917–18, 1919–20, 1920–21, 1921–22, 1925–26, 1927–28, 1928–29, 1930–31, 1933–34, 1934–35, 1941–42, 1945–46, 1946–47, 1958–59, 1959–60, 1962–63, 1963–64, 1968–69, 1970–71, 1972–73, 1978–79, 1982–83, 1983–84, 1984–85, 1985–86, 1988–89, 1989–90, 1990–91, 1991–92, 1992–93, 1993–94, 1995–96, 1996–97, 1997–98, 1999–00, 2000–01, 2001–02, 2002–03, 2004–05, 2005–06, 2010–11, 2020–21."

The facility was chosen at the International Ski Congress in Cape Town, South Africa, on 29 May 2008. Five cities submitted bids for this event. This bid questionnaire used for the upcoming Nordic skiing championships was also used for the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 2013.\nThe finalist cities' deadline for the application was 15 August 2007. From 20 August to 19 September 2007, the FIS Inspection group, led by Secretary-General Sarah Lewis, visited each candidate city for the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2013. The FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 2013 (Cortina d'Ampezzo (Italy), Schladming (Austria), St. Moritz (Switzerland), and Vail/Beaver Creek, Colorado (United States)) (The deadline for the alpine skiing championships was 31 August 2007) were visited in late 2007. This task force consisted of FIS officials and representatives of the European Broadcasting Union to review the proposed event and act as an advisory body on the feasibility of the implementation. A final report was presented to the FIS Council, FIS Technical Committee, and National Ski Associations in April 2008.\nOn 12–13 October 2007, delegates for the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships (five total), FIS Alpine World Ski Championships (four total), FIS Ski-Flying World Championships (two total), and FIS Freestyle World Championships (two total) met in Cape Town to review the rules regarding the promotional activities during the Congress.

        "title": "Texas Longhorns women's basketball",
        "text": "The Texas Longhorns women's basketball team represents the University of Texas at Austin in NCAA Division I intercollegiate women's basketball competition. The Longhorns compete in the Big 12 Conference.\nUnder head coach Jody Conradt, the second NCAA Division I basketball coach to win 900 career games (after Tennessee's Pat Summitt), the Longhorns won the 1986 national championship. Conradt retired after the 2006–07 season, and was replaced by Duke head coach Gail Goestenkors. She resigned after five seasons and was replaced by Karen Aston, whose contract was not renewed following the 2019–20 season. In April 2020, Vic Schaefer was named the program's fifth head coach.\nFrom 1977 to 2022, Texas women's basketball played its home games in the Frank Erwin Special Events Center, where the team compiled a 576–118 (.830) record. The final game played in the Erwin Center was an NCAA second-round victory over Utah, 78–56, on March 20, 2022. Since the start of the 2022–23 season, the team has played in the $388 million Moody Center.\nHistory.\nThe University of Texas held its first basketball competition in 1900, six years before Magnus Mainland started the men's team at Texas. The games in the first few years were intramural. By 1906, the school was playing other institutions, although only home games, not off-campus. Full varsity intercollegiate competition in women's basketball began in 1974. Through the 2021–22 season, the Longhorns rank sixth in total victories and eighth in all-time win percentage among all NCAA Division I women's college basketball programs, with an all-time win–loss record of 1161–424 ().\nThe Longhorns have won 22 total conference championships (12 regular-season conference titles and 10 conference tournament titles) in women's basketball and have made 33 total appearances in the NCAA tournament (49–32 overall record), reaching the NCAA Final Four three times (1986, 1987, 2003) and the NCAA regional finals (Elite Eight) 10 times. Texas won the 1986 NCAA Championship to finish the 1985–86 season with a 34–0 record. Through the 2021–22 season, Texas ranks 10th in all-time NCAA Tournament victories (48), trailing Connecticut (130), Tennessee (128), Stanford (99), Notre Dame (69), Louisiana Tech (65), Duke (61), Georgia (58), Baylor (54) and North Carolina (49).\nEarly years (1900–1966).\nThe very first women's basketball games occurred in 1892, at Smith College, under the direction of Senda Berenson Abbott. Shortly thereafter, Clara Baer brought the game to Louisiana. The details of how the game came to Texas is not known for certain, but in 1900, Eleanore Norvell organized the first basketball game at the University of Texas. Norvell was originally from Oklahoma, and came to Texas to direct the physical education department. She has been at Texas for less than a year when she introduced basketball to students at the school. The first recorded game occurred on Saturday January 13, 1900. The teams played four ten-minute quarters—the final score of that first game was 3–2.\nAlthough the men's game and women's game both had their roots in the Naismith rules, the first set of rules left a lot to be specified, and the rules for the women's game developed differently than for the men. Both Senda Berensen and Clara Baer used Naismith's rules as an inspiration, but developed their own set of rules, including marked areas on the court limiting the movement of players to their respective sections. Some of these rules were motivated by the prevailing assumptions of \"female frailty and dependence\".\nTexas would play limited intercollegiate basketball between 1903 and 1921. Eunice Aden was captain of the basketball team in 1903, took over coaching duties in 1905 and became director of physical education in 1911. Opportunities in basketball grew, but only in a limited way. Intercollegiate play existed, but the school did not allow off-campus games. When Aden retired in 1921, she was replaced by Anna Hiss, who would run the physical education department until 1957. While she was called a visionary for her role in directing physical education and intramurals, she was \"dead-set against intercollegiate athletics for women\". The limited intercollegiate play under Aden came to an end, with basketball now limited to intramurals and interclass play.\nThe ascension of Hiss to the head of the department roughly coincided with the influence of Lou Henry Hoover, First Lady of the United States. In 1923, Hoover was head of the Girl Scouts of the United States. Although Hoover was an advocate of sports, she felt that highly competitive sports were detrimental. Hoover helped to found the Women's Division of the National Amateur Athletic Foundation (WDNAAF). This foundation passed a resolution in 1925 banning extramural competition. The following year, Hiss formed an organization which voted \"condemn intercollegiate competition for women, and to endorse the intramural/interclass model\".\nHiss supported many activities, including tennis, golf, archery, swimming and interpretive dance, but was opposed to team sports. In general, \"artistry was favored over athleticism\". She led an unsuccessful protest against American woman participation in the Olympics of 1928, 1932, and 1936. She was the driving force behind the construction of a Women's Gymnasium (named in her honor after her death). While it was a substantial resource for women's athletics, it was designed to fit her beliefs—the courts were too small for a proper basketball game, and had no room for spectators and the swimming pool was deliberately shorter than Olympic length.\nWhile basketball was not officially supported as a school-sponsored sport in the 1920s and 30s, it was still played by many groups. The interclass games were de-emphasized, but fraternities and sororities played the game, as well as organizations such as the YWCA, industrial leagues and AAU teams.\nIntermediate years (1967–1974).\nAfter Hiss's departure, basketball at Texas began to grow, although it would be almost a decade until it became a full varsity sport. The University of Texas Sports Association (UTSA) a predecessor to the athletic department, organized the sports available for women. Basketball was not one of the club sports offered until a student, Mary Neikirk, organized a petition which was presented to the administration. The school agreed to add basketball as a club sport under the auspices of the UTSA.\nThe first year's budget was $100. A team was formed, and the team played under the girl's rules of the era—six players on a team, two of whom stayed at the defensive end, two of whom stayed in the offensive end and two, called \"rovers\" who could play both ends. These rules were used until 1971, at which time they switched to \"boy's rules\".\nIn 1973, the team practiced and played in the annex of Gregory Gymnasium. Rodney Page, who had some experience as a women's basketball assistant coach, was a referee at one of the games. When the current coach of the team quit, Page was hired. The Texas team, in Pages' first year, compiled a record of 7–11.\nThe 1974 season was a season of transition, with a mixture of firsts and lasts. This year's team was the first to play their games in Gregory Gymnasium itself, rather than the annex. This was the first year the team had trainers, and it was the first year that the Longhorn Band and cheerleaders performed for the team. It was their last year under the auspices of the UTSA. It was the last year before the sport attained the status of a full varsity sport.\nTitle IX was passed in 1972, with a provision prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex. At the time it was passed, it was unknown what impact it would have on sports, including whether it even applied to intercollegiate sports. Two years, later, in 1974, the issue wasn't yet settled, with the Tower Amendment specifically excluding revenue-producing sports, but shortly thereafter, the Tower Amendment was eliminated. It was becoming clear that universities would have to respond sooner or later, but Texas responded in 1974. Shortly after the conclusion of the 1974 basketball season, Stephen Spurr, the University president, announced that a women's athletic department would be started, complete with offices, staff and a budget of $50,000.\nRod Page years (1974–1976).\nSome schools waited for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare to provide specific regulations covering Title IX. These regulations would not be published until 1975. In 1974, Texas began offering varsity sports opportunities to female students in seven sports. In some ways, the University of Texas program became the envy of women at other schools, but the initial progress was relative. Two-thirds of the male athletes at Texas were on scholarship, while only one in fifteen female students were on scholarship. There were 21 male coach positions, almost all full-time, but seven women's coaches who were all part-time.\nUnder Page's leadership, the team improved upon their prior year results, with a record of 17–10. The team started out strong, winning their first five games, including an overtime win against Houston 63–62, before running into Baylor, who won easily 116–62. Some of the games were played as preliminaries to the men's games, but others were stand-alone games.\nThey would also lose their next game to Southwest Texas, on a night when fundraiser was held, with an exhibition match between UT All-Stars and the All American Red Heads Team, a barnstorming team of female basketball players. The team earned an invitation to the Texas AIAW post season tournament, as a second seed behind Southwest Texas. The tournament schedule required five games in three days. The Texas team did well, except against Southwest Texas, ending up with 17 victories against 10 losses, five of which were to Southwest Texas.\nThe following season, Texas team would achieve even more. The basketball team added Retha Swindell, a 6' 2\" rebounder with defensive skills. The school also hired Donna Lopiano, who started what would become a 17-year stint as women's athletic director. She \"vowed to have every Longhorn women's team in the top 10 and at least one national title within five years\". While the school was expressing a commitment to women's varsity sports, not everyone was supportive. The football coach, Darrell Royal, had told President Ford that \"Title IX might be the death of big-time college football.\". Despite that concern, she managed to convince him to support her during her interview.\nThe team's first game was against Southwest Texas, the team that had defeated Texas five times in the previous season. This time, Texas would prevail 57–47 in a game held at their arena. The team lost three in a row as a result of sickness and injury, then responded with a twelve-game winning streak. The team would go on to a 21–7 season record.\nUnder Rod Page, the team had improved materially, so it was a surprise that when the Longhorns completed their regular season, and prepared for the post-season tournament, athletic director Lopiano announced he would not be continuing as coach of the team. The news came as a shock to Page and the team. The reason given was that the position was a head coach of basketball and volleyball—Page did not have volleyball experience. However, Lopiano had her eye on another coach, one she felt could lead the team to become a national contender.\nJody Conradt era (1976–2007).\nLopiano's choice was Jody Conradt, who was garnering national attention as the head coach at the University of Texas at Arlington. She turned a losing program around, and the 1975–76 team would compile a 23–11 record, despite materially strengthening their schedule of opponents at the same time. Two days after announcing that Page would not be returning, Lopiano announced that Conradt would be the coach starting with the next season. Conradt wasn't surprised that the team felt loyalty to Page, but she asked them to \"have an open mind\".\nThe first season under Conradt had a schedule of 46 games. The schedule included games in the Northeast, the first out-of-state trip for the team, and the first airplane ride for many of the players. To save money, the team stayed at the home of Lopiano's parents in Stamford, Connecticut. Texas lost badly to Queens College, then ranked No. 15 in the nation, but went on to the Penn State Invitational where they beat Penn State and Southern Connecticut, at that time a national power. Mel Greenberg, the organizer of the first top 25 women's poll, was in attendance. By the time the team returned to Austin, it learned of its first national ranking at No. 14. The team would complete its first season under Conradt with a record of 36–10.\nConradt coached both basketball and volleyball, but would give up volleyball duties after two seasons. The team would go on to become a dominant women's basketball team on the 1980s, ranked in the AP Top 10 for all but one year between 1979 and 1990.\nTexas would end the 1984 and 1985 seasons with the No. 1 ranking according in the AP poll, but failed to win the national championship in either year. In 1984, they suffered injuries, in 1985, they went 28–3, but were upset in the NCAA tournament by Western Kentucky. 1986 would end differently. Again they achieved the AP No. 1 ranking, but they also went on to win every single game, achieving a record of 34–0, and posting the first undefeated season in women's basketball during the NCAA era (since 1982) and the fourth undefeated season in women's college basketball overall.\nThe 1987 season saw the previous year's NCAA Final Four MVP Clarissa Davis and 1988 Olympian Andrea Lloyd lead the team back to the Final Four, hosted in Austin, but the Lady Longhorns fell in the national semifinals 70-67 to longtime nemesis Louisiana Tech. Davis suffered a knee injury in the 1988 season, limiting her to action in just nine games, while the team rallied for another undefeated Southwest Conference championship season, SWC Tournament title, and No. 1 national seed in the NCAAs. Again, it was Louisiana Tech that ended the Longhorns' season—in Austin—with an 83-80 win in the Elite Eight.\nThree recruiting arrivals in the fall of 1988 and fall of 1989 brought hopes to see Texas build a roster that would help return to the Final Four, with Catarina pollini, a highly touted, 6-foot-5 European standout, and Vicki Hall, the Gatorade National Player of the Year, joining the program before the 1988–89 season. Pollini, a junior transfer, suffered a knee injury and missed 12 games before returning to limited action. At that time, an obscure NCAA rule revealed that if she played past her March 16 birthday that season, it would be considered an additional year of eligibility. Opting to help Davis in her senior season, the team reached the Elite Eight in the Austin Regional where it fell to Maryland 79–71. The next fall, the state of Texas' top recruit in years, Sheryl Swoopes arrived on campus, only to leave due to homesickness before classes started. Swoopes would go on to lead Texas Tech to the 1993 NCAA Championship as Final Four MVP and Naismith College Player of the Year. As for Hall, she earned SWC Freshman of the Year honors in 1989–90 and was Texas' leading scorer the next season as Texas managed a 14–2 finish in Southwest Conference play—including a road loss to Arkansas that ended a streak of 132 conference wins. The Longhorns then lost to Texas Tech in the SWC Tournament championship game and made a Round of 48 exit from the NCAA Tournament in a 77–63 home loss to Lamar. Against Missouri State in the opening game of the 1991–92 season, Hall tore her left ACL. Texas finished 11–3 in conference play (Arkansas had departed for the SEC) and again fell to Texas Tech in the SWC Tournament championship game. The Longhorns' opening game in the NCAA Tournament's round of 32 saw them fall to UCLA 72–71.\nFacilities.\nGregory Gymnasium.\nOriginally built in 1930, Gregory Gymnasium was named after its main advocate and planner, Thomas Watt Gregory. An alumnus of the University, Gregory served on the University's Board of Regents and as United States Attorney General (1914–19) before the gym was built. Gregory Gymnasium is located on the UT central campus, a short distance southeast of the UT Main Building, Tower, and Main Mall and facing west onto Speedway Avenue, the campus's central north–south street.\nThe Texas women's basketball team played home games in the Gregory Gymnasium annex in the 1972–73 season and then in the Gymnasium itself beginning with the 1973–74 season until moving into the Special Events Center (later renamed the Frank Erwin Center) for the 1977–78 season.\nFrank Erwin Center.\nThe Texas women's basketball team opened the Frank Erwin Center on November 29, 1977 with a 67–64 victory over Temple College.\nBuilt for a total cost of $34 million, the building was named for former UT alumnus and Board of Regents member Frank Erwin. Originally known as the Special Events Center, the facility was renamed in 1981 to honor Erwin, who had died that year. The Erwin Center was located at the southeastern corner of the UT central campus and was bounded on the west by Red River Street on the east by Interstate 35.\nA two-level layout (the lower arena and upper mezzanine) accommodated up to 16,540 spectators for basketball games. UT undertook extensive renovations of the facility from 2001 to 2003 at a cost of $55 million, adding, among other things, new and renovated seating, new video and sound systems, new lighting, and 28 suites. As part of the project, UT constructed the Denton A. Cooley Pavilion, a state-of-the-art practice and training facility that sits adjacent to the Erwin Center.\nThe master plan released in 2013 for the University's new Dell Medical School indicated that the Erwin Center would be demolished in a later phase of construction within 6–15 years. The final basketball season played there was 2021–22, with the Moody Center opening the following spring.\nDenton A. Cooley Pavilion.\nBuilt during the final phase of the renovation of the Erwin Center, the Denton A. Cooley Pavilion opened in the fall of 2003. The two-level, 44,000-square-foot building sits adjacent to the Erwin Center and serves as a state-of-the-art practice and training facility for the Texas men's and women's basketball teams. The Pavilion is named for Dr. Denton A. Cooley, a UT alumnus, basketball letterman (1939–41), and pioneering heart surgeon.\nThe Texas men's and women's basketball teams have separate 9,000-square-foot practice court areas, each consisting of one full-court and one half-court practice area with seven basket stations. The practice facility also includes a locker room with a players' lounge, an instructional film theater, a 4,100-square-foot strength and conditioning area, an athletic training and hydrotherapy area, an academic resource and activity center, and a coaches' lounge and locker room.\nThe Cooley Pavilion will be demolished and replaced during the same phase of construction of the Dell Medical School as the Erwin Center.\nMoody Center.\nThe $388 million Moody Center is a multi-purpose arena on the campus of the University of Texas. The replacement to the Frank Erwin Center was built on a former parking lot located immediately south of Mike A. Myers Soccer Stadium. The arena seats 10,000+ for most basketball games and can expand to 15,000+ seats for large basketball games and other events.\nChampionships.\nNational championships\nConference championships\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nTexas has appeared in the NCAA tournament on 36 occasions (tied for third-most appearances all time). The Longhorns' overall record in the tournament is 52–35.\nNCAA tournament seeding history.\nThe NCAA has seeded the Tournament since its inaugural year in 1982. Texas participated in the final AIAW women's basketball tournament in 1982 rather than the inaugural NCAA Tournament (falling in the AIAW Championship Game to Rutgers, 83–77); the Longhorns began participating in the NCAA Tournament in 1983. Texas has appeared in 36 of the 41 Tournaments held since 1983.\nAIAW Division I.\nThe Longhorns made three appearances in the AIAW National Division I basketball tournament, with a combined record of 6–3. \nAP and Coaches polls.\nTexas has been ranked in at least one of the final AP or Coaches polls in 28 seasons since their introduction prior to the 1976–77 and 1985–86 seasons, respectively.

        "text": "The 1999 State of Origin series saw the 18th year that the annual three-game series between the Queensland and New South Wales representative rugby league football teams was contested entirely under 'state of origin' selection rules. The series was drawn and the shield retained by the previous year's victors, Queensland. Each team claimed victory in a game and the deciding fixture finished at 10-all. It was the first series to end in a draw.\nGame I.\nGame I was a dour affair played in hot and steamy conditions at Suncorp Stadium with Queensland scraping in 9-8. The match was memorable for winger Mat Rogers' debut. Despite straining a ligament and being forced from the field, the gutsy flanker returned to score all of Maroons' points including a field goal (the first of his career) six minutes from game's end to win the encounter.\nGame II.\nGame II was played at the new Olympic venue, Stadium Australia, in driving rain and in front of a record crowd. Manly captain, Geoff Toovey returned to the hooking position for NSW after not being selected for Game I. The conditions implied it would be another dour battle, but it turned out otherwise. Melbourne Storm fullback Robbie Ross grabbed his own piece of Origin history by scoring the fastest try in Origin after just 42 seconds. It temporarily took the wind out of the sails of Kevin Walters' Maroons.\nAll the scoring was done in the first half with a try to Rogers and conversion which put Queensland momentarily in front before Laurie Daley, making his final Origin appearance in Sydney, tore onto an Andrew Johns pass and scored under the posts. Sideline commentator, Steve Roach, commented during the telecast that the difference between the two teams was the return of Toovey, who kept the opposing \"markers honest\" and whose delivery from hooker to his halves' partners was sublime throughout the soggy affair. After the match, and in company with other NSW retirees Paul Harragon and Andrew Ettingshausen, Daley completed a lap of honour.\nGame III.\nGame III played at Suncorp in treacherous wet conditions, featured plenty of dropped ball, but some of the skills on show made up for the errors. NSW captain, Brad Fittler was unavailable due to undergoing groin surgery earlier in the month. Laurie Daley once again demonstrated his prowess by miraculously scooping up a ball at his feet and off-loading to Terry Hill who then sent Matt Geyer over. Queensland's Paul Green somehow found his way through Ben Kennedy and Luke Ricketson to score and with Lockyer's conversion the Maroons led 6-4.\nAdrian Lam whose club doctor at the Sydney Roosters had refused to allow him to play because of a dislocated shoulder, was cleared to play for Queensland and proved his worth by squeezing out a miracle pass to put Lockyer over. Geyer then scored for the Blues after an unlikely kick through by prop Rodney Howe to level the scores. Queensland, knowing a draw would be enough to retain the shield, had no interest in a field goal and put all their energy into holding New South Wales out.\nThe Blues were almost there until an inside pass from Daley to Ross went to ground. The Blues players stood around as the Queenslanders rightly celebrated, having retained the title as per the rules of State of Origin at the time."

The three matches drew a total attendance of 187,309 and New South Wales won the series 2-1, their third consecutive series victory, and their last until 2014.\nThe Wally Lewis Medal for Player of the Series was awarded to New South Wales' fullback, Anthony Minichiello. The Ron McAuliffe Medal for Queensland player of the series was awarded to Cameron Smith. The Brad Fittler Medal for New South Wales player of the series was awarded to Matt King.\nGame I.\nThe crowd of 52,484 people at Suncorp Stadium was a record for the ground at the time. After fifty minutes, Queensland had raced away to a 19-0 lead. However New South Wales, under new coach Ricky Stuart made a strong comeback, bringing the score to 20-19 in their favour. A field goal from Johnathan Thurston, in his first match for the Maroons, saw the game go into 'golden point' extra time. Brett Kimmorley, playing halfback in place of an injured Andrew Johns, threw a pass intended for Matt King, but was instead intercepted by Matt Bowen, who snatched a 24-20 victory for the Maroons.\nGame II.\nHaving made his first NRL reappearance just ten days earlier following recovery from injury, Andrew Johns made his State of Origin comeback for Game II with a man-of-the-match performance to help level the 2005 series. This game opened with the Blues sustaining immense pressure on their own line for the opening 15 minutes of the match before breaking through for a try to Minichiello to open the scoring.\nGame III.\nAfter 25 years the 2005 decider was the 75th game between the two sides, with 36 wins for each side.\nAfter an hour New South Wales had raced away to a 32-0 lead and late tries to Queensland proved too little too late. Matt King became only the ninth player (and fourth New South Welshman) to score a hat-trick in State of Origin."

        "title": "1980 State of Origin game",
        "text": "The 1980 State of Origin game was the first game between the Queensland Maroons and the New South Wales Blues rugby league teams to be played under \"state of origin\" selection rules. It was the third match of 1980s annual interstate series between the Blues and the Maroons, and was only allowed to go ahead because the first two matches (and the title) were already won by New South Wales under established 'state of residency' rules. It was played on 8 July 1980 under the newly configured rules by which a player would represent his \"state of origin\", i.e. the state in which he was born or in which he started playing registered first grade rugby league football.\nThe first two matches had been played under the existing residential selection rules - i.e. Blues players could only be sourced from clubs south of the border and the Maroons only from north of it before the single experimental match took place. This was often a source of angst for Queensland as the old state-of-residence rules had long seen some of Queensland's top players actually representing New South Wales as players could earn better money in the Sydney premiership thanks to clubs cashed up with poker machine money. As poker machines were illegal in Queensland, most of the clubs couldn't hope to match the money on offer to their star players, with a steady stream of players leaving to play for Sydney clubs. The list of players who had headed south in the 1960s and 1970s had included Arthur Beetson, John Lang, Rod Reddy, Rod Morris, Mitch Brennan and Kerry Boustead.\nAfter a match involving intense all-in brawling, the Maroons won the first state of origin game 20–10.\nBackground.\nThe first match of the annual best-of-three interstate series was played at Lang Park in Brisbane and won by NSW 35–3. In the second game at Leichhardt Oval in Sydney (described by Qld Wally Lewis as being played on a Tuesday night in front of two men and their dog, with the dog going home at half-time. The official paid attendance was just 1,368 compared to the 25,000 crowd for Game 1 in Brisbane), the Maroons put up more of a fight against a NSW side that was missing a number of players through injury, but were defeated again, this time 17–7. The first State of Origin game very nearly didn't go ahead in 1980. The Queenslanders had put in a spirited and much improved performance in the second game at Leichhardt Oval, with officials confirming that had they actually won the game then the third game of the series would have been played under the State of Residency rules and Origin as it has become might have died then and there. Queenslanders Kerry Boustead, Rod Reddy, Rod Morris, John Lang and Graham Quinn had actually played for NSW in the first two games of the 1980 Interstate series, with all bar Quinn being selected to represent Queensland in the Origin game.\nPrior to the experimental match, the State of Origin concept was derided by the Sydney Media. \"The Daily Mirror's\" Ron Casey showed his opposition to the game, and his bias towards Sydney as a whole when he called it a 'Phoney Promotion' and wrote in his newspaper column: \"\"To the Queensland hillbillies in Premier Joh's Bananaland, the State of Origin match might be a big deal, but to those in the land of the living, here in Sydney, its just another match without much meaning\".\" One member of the Sydney media who welcomed the game was Ray \"Rabbits\" Warren, who wrote in the \"Sunday Telegraph\": \"I know a lot of people are upset at the go-ahead of the State of Origin game, but I congratulate those who pushed it through. Queensland and NSW Country areas need an injection of life and this match can do nothing but good for the game north of the border.\"\nFormer Australian test captain and at the time coach of Eastern Suburbs Bob Fulton, who would later go on to be a successful Australian coach and ironically become a long-term NSW Origin selector, was also against the concept. He wrote in \"The Daily Mirror\" that \"\"Rugby league's non-event of the century will be staged in Brisbane next month, a totally useless State of Origin clash between NSW and Queensland. Only the AU$30,000 gate could make it acceptable to administrators ... No Sydney club could possibly want the match but no doubt it will go ahead. As far as I'm concerned it's strictly a non-event and will achieve absolutely nothing\".\"\nPrior to the game getting the go ahead, the President of the NSWRL Kevin Humphreys, had called a meeting with league delegates from the 12 Sydney based clubs and allowed all to put forward their views on having the Origin style match. In the end, a vote was held with the vote 9–3 in favour of it going ahead (and proving Fulton wrong in the process). Only South Sydney, Eastern Suburbs and St. George opposed the game. Following the meeting, Humphreys rang his QRL counterpart, Senator Ron McAuliffe, with the good news.\nQueensland players such as captain-coach Arthur Beetson and Kangaroos back rower Rod Reddy were enthused to be able to represent their home state while some, such as Australian winger Kerry Boustead, believed that players should represent the state in which they lived (at the time Boustead was playing for Sydney club Eastern Suburbs). However, the test winger offered no objections to his selection for the Maroons and went on to become the first Qld player to score a try in Origin football.\nMatch summary.\nThe NSWRL demanded a neutral referee for the game. As a consequence, respected British referee Billy Thompson was flown from England to control the game. Queensland went into the game not having won a match since 1975. Before the game, QRL President McAuliffe entered the Maroons dressing room to make a personal plea to the players. He said: \"\"The future of the game is in your hands. We have taken this bold step. If we are beaten we cannot retreat to any other position. We must win\".\"\nIn front of a capacity Lang Park crowd of 33,210, which included State of Origin's instigator, Senator Ron McAulliffe, Federal Defence Minister Jim Killen, and journalist Hugh Lunn, the Maroons were led out by former Kangaroos skipper, 35-year-old Arthur Beetson who was playing for Queensland for the first time. Beetson, after starring for Redcliffe in Brisbane in 1964 and 1965, had been told by the QRL that if he stayed in Brisbane he would be in line for state selection in 1966. However, he received an offer he couldn't refuse from Sydney club Balmain and ended up playing 18 games for NSW between 1966 and 1977 under the old state of residency rule. Beetson was actually playing Reserve Grade for the Parramatta Eels in Sydney at the time that Ron McAulliffe approached him and offered him the chance to finally play for his home state.\nThe first points scored in Origin Football was a penalty goal by heavyweight Queensland Mal Meninga - the first of seven goals from seven attempts he would kick in the match (on his 20th birthday no less), while New South Wales' winger Greg Brentnall had the honour of scoring the first try in State of Origin football following good lead up work by Kangaroos pair Graham Eadie and Mick Cronin. After an all-in brawl in the first half and leading 9–5 at the break, Queensland took over the game and with Mal Meninga kicking 7/7 goals defeated NSW 20–10, the first time the Maroons had won a state game over NSW since 1975. Queensland centre Chris Close was the standout player from both sides, scoring a try in the second half and was a clear choice as Man of the Match. From a standing start, Close received the ball only 25m out from Meninga. He then simply accelerated through a big hole in the NSW defence and evaded fullback Graham Eadie to put the ball down next to the goal posts without a NSW player touching him.\nAlan Clarkson, a journalist for \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" wrote of the State of Origin experiment, \"I was strongly against such a match, but last night's gripping clash showed that such a fixture would be a welcome addition to the League program.\"\nAlthough they had already represented Queensland in under the old residency rules, the win by the Maroons brought Queensland's new generation players such as heavyweight centres Chris Close and Mal Meninga, as well as lock forward Wally Lewis into the spotlight. The trio, along with other Queensland-based players such as Colin Scott, Gene Miles, Brad Backer, Mark Murray, Bryan Niebling, Wally Fullerton-Smith and Greg Conescu would dominate Origin football over the next 4 years.\nTeams.\nOf the twenty-six players taking the field in the first State of Origin match, twenty were selected from the New South Wales Rugby Football League clubs while six were from Queensland Rugby League clubs.\nQueensland.\nWith Queenslanders playing for New South Welsh clubs now available for selection, seven of the Maroons' starting thirteen were selected from Sydney clubs."

        "title": "Longwood Cricket Club",
        "text": "Longwood Cricket Club is a tennis and former cricket club based in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, United States. It is the site of the first Davis Cup competition.\nHistory.\nA club for cricket was opened in 1877 at Longwood Estate, a place named after the house Napoleon Bonaparte stayed at while exiled to Saint Helena. Located on the outskirts of Boston on land donated by the Sears family, cricketers and baseball players put Longwood on the sports map. Specifically, Harry Wright, first player-manager of the Boston Red Stockings, played cricket for the United States, as did his brother George Wright. George Wright combined with tennis pro Charlie Chambers in league games throughout New England and played at Longwood against Lord Harris' XI in 1891. George Wright was the co-proprietor of Wright and Ditman, purveyor of fine sports goods. Wright brought the first tennis gear to Boston on his return from a baseball-cricket tour of England in 1874. Wright also taught tennis to Harvard students and toured with them in California in 1890. It was George Wright who deserves the credit for Longwood's broad-based sporting tradition, having excelled in baseball and cricket as a paid professional and at tennis as a promoter of the game. A lawn tennis court was laid in 1878, two years after the organization of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club at Lord's Cricket Ground in London. On January 5, 1888, Longwood member and US cricket team captain C.L. Bixby led the team to a win over the West Indies cricket team at the Bourda ground in Georgetown, Guyana. Richard D. Sears, who won seven United States Championships, would soon become a club member as well.\nThe club's first tennis tournament was held in 1882. The following year saw the first Longwood Bowl tournament, attracting top American players. It would continue to be held annually until 1942. The Eastern Championship for doubles tennis was held in 1890. Cricket was last played at Longwood in 1933 before a one-off game was held in October 2008 between the Faded Blues CC and St. Columba's Cricket Club from Newport, Rhode Island.\nFormer notable events.\nDavis Cup.\nIn 1900 Dwight Davis, then a fourth-year student at nearby Harvard University, arranged for a British team to visit Longwood and compete for what became the first Davis Cup, branded the International Lawn Tennis Challenge. The Davis-captained Americans won the inaugural contest 3–0.\nIn total, 15 Davis Cup ties have been settled at Longwood. The British Isles defeated the Americans 4–1 in the 1903 final. The 1908 semi-final saw the Americans reverse their fortunes and prevail by the same score. The next eight ties played at Longwood did not involve the American team. 1914 saw Australia defeat Britain 3–0 in a semi-final. 1922 through 1925 saw a tie played a year with Australasia defeating France 4–1 in a quarterfinal encounter in 1922, Australia beating France by the same score in a 1923 semi-final and in 1924, but by a 3–2 scoreline, and Australia defeating Japan 4–1 in 1925. After France swept Japan 5–0 in a 1927 semi-final, the Davis Cup would not return to Longwood for 11 years, with Australia defeating Nazi Germany 5–0 in the 1938 semi-final. A further decade would elapse before in 1948 Australia won another semi, this time over Czechoslovakia, 3–1. In 1957, the U.S. team returned to Brookline to defeat Brazil 5–0 in a 3rd round tie. Two years later saw Australia dispatch with India 4–1 in the penultimate round.\nAnother 40 years would pass before in 1999, Australia, led by Pat Rafter and Lleyton Hewitt defeated the U.S., led by Pete Sampras, 4–1 in a quarterfinal tie played on hard courts. This was the last time a top-flight professional tennis match was played at Longwood.\nU.S. Pro Tennis Championships.\nThe U.S. Pro Tennis Championships a Major (1927-67) professional tennis tournament was contested annually at Longwood from 1964 to 1999, when it was discontinued, with the exception of 1995, when the tournament was rained out and 1996, when it was not scheduled.\nLongwood Bowl.\nThe Longwood Bowl was a men's and women's tennis tournament first played at the Longwood Cricket Club courts at Brookline, Massachusetts, United States from 1882 to 1949.\nNew England Championships.\nThe New England Championships also called the New England Sectional Championships was a men's and women's open tennis tournament staged annually at various locations including Longwood CC from 1886 until 1978."

He played in 17 Tests between 1963 and 1968 as captain on 1 occasion. He is considered one of the nation's finest footballers of the 20th century.\nEarly life.\nHickey was born in Townsville, Australia. He was educated at St Edmund's College, Ipswich from 1950 to 1955.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in Townsville, Queensland Gallagher played his entire Brisbane Rugby League premiership first grade career of 11 seasons with the Brothers club. He first represented Queensland at age 25 in 1962 and then regularly over the next 5 years making 12 appearances against New South Wales as well as 5 appearances against touring international sides. Gallagher made his Test debut against New Zealand in the first Test of the 1963 series in Sydney and played in all five domestic Tests that year against New Zealand and South Africa. At the end of that year he was selected for the 1963 Kangaroo Tour of England and France.

        "text": "The 1992 PPG Indy Car World Series season was the 14th national championship season of American open wheel racing sanctioned by CART (d.b.a \"IndyCar\"). The season consisted of 16 races. Bobby Rahal was the national champion, his third and final career CART title. Stefan Johansson was named the Rookie of the Year. The 1992 Indianapolis 500 was sanctioned by USAC, but counted towards the CART points championship. Al Unser Jr. won the Indy 500 in the closest finish in the history of that event.\nStarting in 1992, and continuing through 1996, the CART organization began operating under the name IndyCar. The term IndyCar was a registered trademark of IMS, Inc., and was licensed to CART from 1992 to 1996. The use of the term \"CART\" was curtailed in the series and in the media in favor of IndyCar during this period.\nThe circuit welcomed a new venue in 1992, New Hampshire International Speedway.\nBobby Rahal, who was in his first season as an owner/driver, won four races and three poles en route to the title. Rahal's three oval wins included a dominating wire-to-wire victory at Phoenix, where he led all 200 laps. Rahal fielded the \"tried and true\" Lola/Ilmor Chevrolet \"A\" combination. It was the final championship for the Ilmor Chevy A engine. Rahal managed to outperform the newer engines that joined the series in 1992, the Ford/Cosworth XB, as well as the Ilmor Chevy \"B\" engine, which was used by the Penske team. For the third time, Michael Andretti finished runner-up to Rahal in the points. Andretti promptly left Indy car racing the following year to race in Formula One. \nA bevy of crashes, some serious, at the 1992 Indianapolis 500 injured several drivers, and shook up the driver lineup during parts of the season. Jovy Marcelo was fatally injured in a practice crash, while Nelson Piquet suffered devastating leg injures in another practice crash. Hiro Matsushita suffered a fractured leg and missed several races over the summer. Mario Andretti, Rick Mears, and Jimmy Vasser all sat out the race at Detroit while they recovered from injuries. In July, Mears dropped out of the Michigan 500 with nagging injuries, and ultimately sat out the rest of the season. Mears then unexpectedly retired from racing in December.\nDrivers and constructors.\nThe following teams and drivers competed in the 1992 Indy Car World Series season.\nSeason Summary.\nSchedule.\n Oval/Speedway&lt;br&gt;\n Road/Street course&lt;br&gt;\n Non-championship event&lt;br&gt;\nFinal driver standings.\nNote: Jovy Marcelo was killed in practice for the 1992 Indianapolis 500.

        "title": "Triple Crown (snooker)",
        "text": "The Triple Crown in professional snooker refers to winning the sport's three longest-running and most prestigious tournaments: the World Snooker Championship (first held in 1927 and staged as a knockout tournament continuously since 1969), the invitational Masters (held annually since 1975), and the UK Championship (held annually since 1977). In January 2020, the three tournaments were formally named the \"Triple Crown Series\".\nAny player who has won all three Triple Crown tournaments at least once over the course of their career is said to have won a \"career Triple Crown\", and they gain the right to wear an embroidered crown on their waistcoat to reflect the achievement. As of 2023, eleven players have won a career Triple Crown: Steve Davis, Terry Griffiths, Stephen Hendry, Alex Higgins, John Higgins, Shaun Murphy, Ronnie O'Sullivan, Neil Robertson, Mark Selby, Judd Trump, and Mark Williams. O'Sullivan has won the most Triple Crown titles, with 23; Hendry has won 18, and Davis 15.\nDavis, Hendry, and Williams are the only three players to have won all three Triple Crown events in a single season (Davis in 1987–88, Hendry in both 1989–90 and 1995–96, and Williams in 2002–03). Hendry is the only player to have accomplished this feat twice.\nHistory.\nIn 1969, the World Snooker Championship became a single elimination tournament, replacing the previous challenge format; this change marks the start of professional snooker's \"modern era\". Six years later, a non-ranking invitational event, the Masters, was introduced; there were 10 competitors in the inaugural Masters in 1975, later increasing to 16 players. When John Spencer won the 1975 Masters tournament, he became the first person to win two Triple Crown events, having won the world championships in 1969 and 1971. The following year, Ray Reardon won both the Masters and World Championship in the same season.\nIn 1977, the UK Championship was created. Originally restricted to British residents and passport holders, the tournament was opened to all professionals in 1984 and also became a ranking event. Patsy Fagan won the 1977 UK Championship, in his only Triple Crown final. In the 1980–81 season, Steve Davis won both the UK Championship and the World Championship, and was the first player to complete the career Triple Crown when he won the Masters the following season. Davis was also the first player to complete the season Triple Crown, winning all three events in the 1987–88 season.\nThe Triple Crown events are sometimes referred to as the \"big three BBC events\", due to them having been broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation since inception. They are also sometimes called \"snooker's majors\", or the \"big three\" events. However, some have questioned the status of the Triple Crown events, arguing that the World Championship is snooker's only major tournament. John Higgins has described the Tour Championship, first held in 2019, as \"far bigger than the UK [Championship]\".\nTriple Crown events are considered the most prestigious snooker titles, and have historically offered the most prize money. However, the total prize money for other events, such as the China Open, has exceeded that of the UK Championship and Masters in recent years. From the 2020 Masters onward, players who have completed the Triple Crown are eligible to have a gold crown embroidered on their playing waistcoats in recognition of the achievement.\nIn 2023, World Snooker Tour introduced a £147,000 bonus for any player making two maximum breaks during the season's Triple Crown Series. The bonus could be awarded up to three times, for a total of £441,000, if three players each made two maximums. The same player could potentially win £441,000 by making six maximums in the events.\nIn January 2024, World Snooker Tour introduced a new Triple Crown logo, as part of the new branding of the organisation.\nCareer Triple Crown winners.\nEleven players have completed a career Triple Crown: Steve Davis, Terry Griffiths, Alex Higgins, Stephen Hendry, John Higgins, Mark Williams, Ronnie O'Sullivan, Neil Robertson, Mark Selby, Shaun Murphy, and Judd Trump. Only Davis, Hendry and Williams have won all three Triple Crown events in the same season. Hendry is the only player to have achieved the feat twice, in the 1989–90 and 1995–96 seasons.\nOn winning the 1999 Masters, Higgins held all three Triple Crown titles at the same time but his victories spanned two separate seasons. O'Sullivan came close to holding all three titles at once, making the final of all three events in 2014; he won the Masters and UK titles that year but not the World title, despite being the defending champion for the second successive year. Only O'Sullivan and Hendry have managed to successfully defend all three Triple Crown events. In 2013, Robertson became the first player from outside the United Kingdom to complete the career Triple Crown.\nFollowing his win in the 2018 UK Championship, O'Sullivan surpassed Hendry's previous record of 18 Triple Crown titles, and has now won 23. Trump is the latest player to have achieved a career Triple Crown, winning both the Masters and World Championship in the 2018–19 season after having already won the UK Championship in 2011.\nSources: World Championship; UK Championship; Masters.\nOne win away from Triple Crown.\nOf those still active on the main professional tour (), five players have won two of the three Triple Crown events, leaving them one away from completing a career Triple Crown. Jimmy White, Matthew Stevens, Ding Junhui and Mark Allen have all won the Masters and UK Championship at least once, but all four players need to win the World Championship to complete their Triple Crown. Stuart Bingham has a World title and a Masters title, but is yet to win the UK Championship for his career Triple Crown.\nSeven former professional players—Peter Ebdon, John Parrott, Ray Reardon, John Spencer, Dennis Taylor, Doug Mountjoy and Cliff Thorburn—won two of the three Triple Crown events before their retirement. Ebdon and Parrott both won UK and World titles, and Parrott reached the final of the Masters on three occasions between 1989 and 1992 but never won the title. Reardon, Spencer, Taylor and Thorburn won the World Championship and Masters tournaments during their careers, but not the UK Championship. Mountjoy came close to winning the World Championship in 1981, only to lose to Steve Davis in the final.\nTournament winners.\nA list of all winners of the three Triple Crown events is shown below by season:\nSources: UK Championship; Masters; World Championship."

        "text": "The Connecticut Open is the Connecticut state open golf tournament, open to both amateur and professional golfers. It is organized by the Connecticut State Golf Association. It has been played annually since 1931 (except for war years) at a variety of courses around the state. It was considered a PGA Tour event in the 1930s.\nHistory.\nIn 1915 and 1916 there was a significant golf event entitled the Connecticut Open. The English golfer Jim Barnes won it both years. In the 1920s, there was talk of renewing the event. In 1930, an event entitled the Connecticut Open was scheduled to be hosted on September 13 and 14. The event was scheduled to be held at Shenecossett Club. However, it failed to receive \"sanction\" from the Connecticut Golf Association. The event was canceled by September 3. It was also reported during late 1930 that the Connecticut Golf Association was planning on sanctioning an official state open in the summer of 1931. \nThe first Connecticut Open sanctioned by the Connecticut Golf Association was held in 1931. Eighty players entered in the first tournament. The event was two rounds long and played over one day at Yale Golf Course. Playing against \"a light rain\" and \"a strong, chilly wind,\" as reported by \"The New York Times\", Henry Ciuci managed to score 152 to win. He defeated Jack Ryan, the assistant professional at Yale GC, by two shots. A number of players finished one shot further back to tie for third, including amateur Charles Clare. As low amateur, he earned a silver plate. Ciuci won $250 and the right to hold a Connecticut Golf Association shield for a year. For most of the early years of the Connecticut Open, however, it was the professional Johnny Golden that dominated. Golden won four consecutive tournaments from 1932 through 1935. However, in January 1936 he abruptly died of pneumonia. Later in the year, Leo Mallory, Golden's former assistant at Wee Burn, won the Connecticut Open with 283 total. It was the lowest total since the tournament switched from a two-round tournament to a four-round tournament. The following year, at Wampanoag Country Club, he won by 10 shots, another tournament record. In 1941, Jimmy Demaret, who won the Masters the previous year, won the Connecticut Open. The tournament was not held until 1946 due to World War II.\nFormer PGA Tour pro Mike Colandro won the event in 1986. Despite his win, he advocated some changes to the tournament. According to the \"Hartford Courant\", shortly after his victory \"he called for the sponsoring Connecticut State Golf Association to open the event to all state pros, get a sponsor and increase the $10,000 purse.\"\nIn 1997, PGA Tour player Ken Green played the event. Many were surprised to see a current PGA Tour player in the field. He explained, \"I don't really want to be here, but I don't have any choice. I have a negative net worth.\"\nWinners.\nSource:"

        "title": "UCI World Championships",
        "text": "The UCI World Championships are annual competitions promoted by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) to determine world champion cyclists. They are held in several different styles of racing, in a different country each year. Championship winners wear a white jersey with coloured bands around the chest for the following year. The similarity to the colours of a rainbow gives them the colloquial name of \"the rainbow jersey.\" The first three individuals or teams in each championship win gold, silver and bronze medals. Former world champions are allowed to wear a trim to their collar and sleeves in the same pattern as the rainbow jersey.\nChampionships are held for men and for women in road cycling, track cycling, cyclo-cross, mountain biking, gravel, BMX, and indoor cycling. There are also championships for disabled competitors.\nHistory.\nThe first recognised world championships were promoted by the International Cycling Association, a body formed in November 1892 by cycling bodies from Britain, Canada, France, Holland, Italy, Germany and Belgium. The ICA was formed at the initiative of the National Cyclists' Union in Britain. Until then its own championships, open to riders from any country, were considered the unofficial championships of the world. It was because the sport needed world championships independent of any national body that Henry Sturmey of the magazine \"The Cyclist\" and later founder of the Sturmey-Archer gear company proposed an International Cyclists Association in 1892.\nThe first recognised world championship was held in Chicago in 1893, with track races at one mile, 10 kilometres, and a 100 km race in which riders were paced by tandems of up to six riders. An American, Arthur Augustus Zimmerman, won the mile and 10 km races and a South African, Mentjes, won the 100 km.\nThe 1894 championship in Antwerp were, like Chicago, for amateurs. Lehr, a German, won the mile, Jaap Eden of Holland won the 10 km and Henie of Norway the 100 km.\nProfessionals raced from 1895, in Cologne, when Jimmy Michael of Britain won the 100 km.\nThe definition of amateurs and professionals was important for the International Cycling Association, to which the National Cyclists Union would allow only national bodies which shared its own strict definition of amateurism. That definition excluded the main French body, the Union Vélocipèdique Française, which had been allowed to observe the founding meeting but not to vote. French discontent at that exclusion, and that the British insisted on separate votes for England, Wales, Ireland and its colonies, led France and other countries to set up a rival body before the 1900 races. The Union Cycliste Internationale became the world governing body and the International Cycling Association vanished.\nIn 2023, the various UCI World Championships were held in the same location for the first time, with 190 world titles awarded at the 2023 UCI Cycling World Championships in Glasgow, Scotland. This will be held every 4 years in future, with the 2027 edition to be held in Haute-Savoie, France."

        "text": "The 1988 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament began on March 16 and ended on April 3. The tournament featured 40 teams. The Final Four consisted of Long Beach State, Auburn, Tennessee, and Louisiana Tech. Louisiana Tech won its second title with a 56-54 victory over Auburn. Louisiana Tech's Erica Westbrooks was named the Most Outstanding Player of the tournament.\nNotable events.\nLong Beach state reached the Final Four averaging over 100 points per game. Long Beach beat Colorado 103–64 in their opening game. Long Beach then defeated the three seed Washington 104–78 in the West Regional semifinal. That matched Long Beach up with the one seed Iowa. Long Beach didn't score 100, but came close, beating the top seed in their regional by a score of 98–78, allowing Long Beach to reach the Final Four for the second straight year. Their opponent in the semifinal was Auburn, who had reached the Sweet Sixteen in 1985 and 1986, then followed it with a trip to the Elite Eight in 1987. This year Auburn advanced to the Final Four for the first time defeating Maryland in the Mideast Regional 103–74.\nIn the semifinal game, the Long Beach 49ers team started out slowly, but their coach Joan Bonvicini wasn't worried; she was convinced they would come back. Auburn had a small lead in the second half when the 49ers scored 11 consecutive points to take a 46–42 lead. However, the Tigers tied the game at 46 apiece, then 48 then 50 apiece. Then the Tigers opened up a seven-point lead. The 49ers cut it back to five points, but too many turnovers were too much to overcome. Ruthie Bolton scored eleven points in the final six minutes for the Tigers to help seal the 68–55 victory, and the right to play for the national championship.\nThe other semifinal game matched up Tennessee and Louisiana Tech. Tennessee was the defending national champion, having won their first national championship in 1987. They won the East Regional with a win over the two seed Virginia. Their opponent, Louisiana Tech, had won the first NCAA Tournament in 1982, and had finished as runner up to Tennessee in the previous year's championship game. The two teams met in the regular season, with Tennessee winning 76–74 in an overtime game played in Knoxville. The Lady Techsters were a two seed, but upset top ranked Texas 83–80 in the Midwest Regional to make it to the semifinal game. The Lady Techsters said they had been looking forward to this game ever since their loss in the prior year and they played like it. They took the lead early in the game and never relinquished it. Louisiana Tech held Tennessee to 33% shooting in the first half, and held on to win the game 68–59, and a berth in the championship game.\nThe first half of the championship game was all Auburn. Two minutes went by before the Lady Techsters even took at shot, at which point they were down 6–0. Ruthie Bolton scored 16 points in the first half, a source of frustration for her defender Teresa Weatherspoon. Bolton's points held the Tigers head to halftime with a 31–19 lead. Weatherspoon made sure the second half was different, both offensively, with seven assists and defensively, holding Bolton to zero points and helping to force six turnovers. The Tigers still led by four points with under five minutes left, but behind Weatherspoon's defense, and Erica Westbrooks' 25 points, Louisiana Tech came back to win their second national Championship by a score of 56–54.\nRecords.\nRuthie Bolton was credited with ten steals in the National Semifinal game, the most ever recorded in a Final Four game since the statistic has been recorded (starting in 1988).\nQualifying teams – automatic.\nForty teams were selected to participate in the 1988 NCAA Tournament. Eighteen conferences were eligible for an automatic bid to the 1988 NCAA tournament.\nQualifying teams – at-large.\nTwenty-two additional teams were selected to complete the forty invitations.\nBids by conference.\nEighteen conferences earned an automatic bid. In eight cases, the automatic bid was the only representative from the conference. Two conferences, Southland and American South sent a single representative as an at-large team. Twenty additional at-large teams were selected from ten of the conferences.\nFirst and second rounds.\nIn 1988, the field remained at 40 teams. The teams were seeded, and assigned to four geographic regions, with seeds 1-10 in each region. In Round 1, seeds 8 and 9 faced each other for the opportunity to face the 1 seed in the second round, while seeds 7 and 10 faced each other for the opportunity to face the 2 seed.\nIn the first two rounds, the higher seed was given the opportunity to host the first round game. In most cases, the higher seed accepted the opportunity. The exception:\nThe following table lists the region, host school, venue and the twenty-four first and second round locations:\nRegionals and Final Four.\nThe regionals, named for the general location, were held from March 24 to March 26 at these sites:\nEach regional winner advanced to the Final Four, held April 1 and April 3 in Tacoma, Washington at the Tacoma Dome, co-hosted by Seattle University &amp; University of Washington.\nBids by state.\nThe forty teams came from twenty-five states.\nPennsylvania had the most teams with four.

        "title": "Bill Lucas (baseball)",
        "text": "William DeVaughn Lucas (January 25, 1936 – May 5, 1979) was an American professional baseball infielder who became the first African-American general manager in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Atlanta Braves from mid-September 1976 until his death in early May 1979. A member of the Braves' organization for 23 years, he was inducted into the Ivan Allen Jr. Braves Museum and Hall of Fame in 2006.\nBiography.\nLucas was born in Jacksonville, Florida. A graduate of Florida A&amp;M University, he signed as an infielder with the Milwaukee Braves in 1957 and played in the Class C California League. He then served two years as an officer in the United States Army. Lucas returned to the Braves' farm system in 1960, reached the Triple-A level with the Denver Bears of the Pacific Coast League in 1963, and finished his minor league career with the Austin Senators of the Double-A Texas League in 1964. Overall, Lucas played professionally for six seasons, batting .273 in 655 games.\nLucas joined the Braves' front office in 1965, working in sales and promotions during the team's relocation to Atlanta before he switched to the player development department in 1967. Lucas was named the director of the Braves' farm system in 1972 and promoted to GM responsibilities on September 17, 1976. At the time, the Braves were in last place in the National League West Division, games behind the division leader. Owner Ted Turner gave Lucas, whose official title was vice president of player personnel, all the duties of a general manager, while Turner kept the official title himself.\nWith players like Dale Murphy coming up through Lucas' minor league system, and the selection of Bob Horner as the top pick in the 1978 MLB draft, the Braves began assembling the team that would win the 1982 division title.\nThe job of rebuilding the Braves was compounded by Turner's tempestuous behavior. On May 11, 1977, the owner appointed himself the Braves' field manager during a losing streak. Turner's dugout reign drew national headlines but lasted only one day before the president of the National League ruled that Turner, as an owner, could not appoint himself manager. Starting in 1978, Lucas found himself caught between Turner and players like rookie Horner and veteran pitcher Phil Niekro, a future Hall of Famer, during contentious contract negotiations.\nOn the evening of May 1, 1979, with the Braves on the road facing the Pittsburgh Pirates at Three Rivers Stadium, Lucas watched on television from his Atlanta home as Niekro won his 200th major league game, 5–2. Hours after congratulating Niekro by phone, Lucas was stricken with cardiac arrest and a massive cerebral hemorrhage. He died three days later without regaining consciousness at age 43. At his passing, he was still the highest-ranking black executive in professional baseball. Said Murphy at Lucas' funeral, \"Bill's dream was for this organization to become a success. It is our sacred honor to be chosen to fulfill his dream.\"\nLucas' widow, Rubye, later served on the board of directors of the Turner Broadcasting System and as president of the William D. Lucas Fund, which helps send young baseball players to college. Lucas' sister, Barbara, was the former wife of Hall of Fame inductee Hank Aaron; the two were married from 1953 to 1971."

        "title": "History of professional baseball in Milwaukee",
        "text": "The following is a history of professional baseball in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, including its current team, the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball.\nOverview and legacy.\nPrior to the development of professional baseball, the Cream City Club of Milwaukee—commonly known as the Milwaukee Cream Citys—played in the 1860s and were quite successful. Milwaukee was an early prospect for professional baseball, with several brief experiments at the major league level but mostly in the minor leagues.\nThe nicknames of these teams were initially assigned by the media rather than the teams themselves. Some were known as the \"Creams\" or \"Cream Citys\" after the distinctive brick which gave Milwaukee its nickname, others were known as the \"Brewers\", in reference to one of the city's chief industries.\nThis list is a brief overview of the various Milwaukee professional baseball clubs:\nChronology, 1876–1944.\nThe nickname \"Brewers\" has been used by Milwaukee baseball teams since at least the 1880s, although none of those clubs ever enjoyed a measure of success or stability. That would change with Milwaukee's entry into the American Association, which would last 50 years and provide the city's springboard into the major leagues.\nMilwaukee Brewers of the American Association (1902–1952).\nThe American Association Milwaukee Brewers were founded in 1901, after the major-league Brewers of the American League moved to St. Louis and became the St. Louis Browns. The minor-league Brewers did not win their first American Association championship until 1913, then repeated the next year. Over 20 years would pass before they claimed another with a 90–64 club in 1936 as a Detroit affiliate. In 1944, the team won again, placing the team in the top 100. Three years later, the Brewers became a farm team of the Boston Braves. Although this move eventually paved the way for the team's demise, in the short run it led directly to Milwaukee's final two league championships—one in 1951 when they also won the Junior World Series, followed by an even better team the next year.\nBill Veeck and Jolly Cholly.\nIn 1941, the club was purchased by Bill Veeck (son of former Chicago Cubs president William Veeck Sr.), in a partnership with former Cubs star Charlie Grimm (nicknamed \"Jolly Cholly\"). Under Veeck's ownership, the Brewers would become one of the most colorful squads in baseball and Veeck would become one of the game's premiere showmen. Constantly creating new promotional gimmicks, Veeck gave away live animals, scheduled morning games for wartime night shift workers, staged weddings at home plate, and even sent Grimm a birthday cake containing a much-needed left-handed pitcher.\nWhen Grimm was hired as the manager of the Cubs, he recommended that Casey Stengel be hired to replace him. Veeck was opposed to the idea – Stengel had little success in his previous managerial stints with the Dodgers and Braves – but as Veeck was stationed overseas in the Marine Corps, Grimm won out. The club went on to win the 1944 American Association pennant, and Stengel's managerial career was resurrected.\nIn 1945, after winning three pennants in five years, Veeck sold his interest in the Brewers for a $275,000 profit.\nJunior World Series appearances.\nThe Junior World Series was held between the champions of the American Association and the International League.\nBallpark.\nDuring its 51-year tenure in the American Association, Milwaukee played in the same ballpark. Originally constructed in 1888, it was located in the North side of Milwaukee on a rectangular city block with the main entrance on Chambers St. between Eighth and Ninth Streets. It had abnormally short foul lines, to left and right. The fences then angled out sharply, making for deep \"power alleys\" and center field was from home plate. It was known as Athletic Park until 1928 when it was renamed Borchert Field in honor of Brewers owner Otto Borchert, who had died the previous year. The Polo Grounds had a similar configuration. 'Borchert Orchard' was also the first Milwaukee home park for the Green Bay Packers, who played the New York Giants on Oct. 1, 1933. The following year, the Packers moved their Milwaukee games to the Wisconsin State Fair Grounds. Interstate 43 now runs through where Borchert Field once stood.\nThe coming of the Braves (1953–1965).\nMilwaukee had long been coveted by major league teams looking for a new home. Bill Veeck himself tried to relocate the St. Louis Browns back to Milwaukee in the late 1940s, but his move was vetoed by the other American League owners. Eventually, they relocated to Baltimore, where they became the current edition of the Baltimore Orioles.\nThe city of Milwaukee, hoping to attract a major league club, constructed Milwaukee County Stadium for the 1953 season. The Brewers were set to move in, until Spring training of 1953, when Lou Perini moved his Boston Braves to Milwaukee. The Brewers moved to Toledo, where they became the next incarnation of the Toledo Mud Hens. The new Mud Hens continued their winning ways, claiming an American Association pennant in their first season in Ohio.\nThe return of the Brewers (1970).\nThe legacy of the American Association Milwaukee Brewers continues in the major league Milwaukee Brewers, which took its name from the 1902–1952 club.\nAfter the Braves moved to Atlanta in 1966, local automobile dealer and Braves part-owner Bud Selig created a group to lobby for a new major league club in Milwaukee. As a name for his group, he chose \"Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Club, Inc.\", after the American Association club he grew up watching. As a logo, he chose the Beer Barrel Man in navy and red – traditional Brewers colors.\nWhen Selig bought the one-year-old Seattle Pilots franchise in the spring of 1970, he moved them to Milwaukee and they officially became the \"new\" major-league Milwaukee Brewers. The club continued to use the Beer Barrel Man as the team's primary logo until 1978, although due to time constraints, the team continued to use the old Pilots' colors of blue and gold. Recently, it has seen a resurgence on throwback merchandise, and been featured on several stadium promotions.\nThe current Brewers have played in the National League since 1998, when the franchise switched over from the American League after 29 years in the \"Junior Circuit\" as both the Pilots and the Brewers.\nThe modern Brewers.\n1966–1969: \"Home of the Braves?\".\nIn an effort to prevent the relocation of the Milwaukee Braves to a larger television market, Braves minority owner Bud Selig, a Milwaukee-area car dealer, formed an organization named \"Teams Inc.\" devoted to local control of the club. He successfully prevented the majority owners of the Braves from moving the club in 1964 but was unable to do more than delay the inevitable. The Braves relocated to Atlanta after the 1965 season, and Teams Inc. turned its focus to returning Major League Baseball to Milwaukee.\nSelig doggedly pursued this goal, attending owners meetings in the hopes of securing an expansion franchise. Selig changed the name of his group to \"Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Club Inc.\". The \"Brewers\" name, honoring Milwaukee's beer-brewing tradition, also was traditional for Milwaukee baseball teams going back into the 19th century. The city had hosted a major league team by that name in 1901, which relocated at the end of that season to become the St. Louis Browns. From 1902 through 1952, a minor league Milwaukee Brewers club in the American Association had been so successful that it lured the Braves from Boston. Selig himself had grown up watching that minor league team at Borchert Field and intended his new franchise to follow in that tradition.\nTo demonstrate there still was support for big-league ball in Milwaukee, Selig's group contracted with Chicago White Sox owner Arthur Allyn Jr. to host nine White Sox home games at Milwaukee County Stadium in 1968. A 1967 exhibition game between the White Sox and Minnesota Twins had attracted more than 51,000 spectators, and Selig was convinced the strong Milwaukee fan base would demonstrate the city would provide a good home for a new club.\nThe experiment was staggeringly successful – those nine games drew 264,297 fans. In Chicago that season, the Sox drew 539,478 fans to their remaining 72 home games. In just a handful of games, the Milwaukee crowds accounted for nearly \"one-third\" of the total attendance at White Sox games. In light of this success, Selig and Allyn agreed County Stadium would host Sox home games again the next season.\nIn 1969, the Sox schedule in Milwaukee was expanded to include 11 home games (one against every other franchise in the American League at the time). Although those games were attended by slightly fewer fans (198,211 fans, for an average of 18,019) they represented a greater percentage of the total White Sox attendance than the previous year – over one-third of the fans who went to Sox home games in 1969 did so at County Stadium (in the remaining 59 home dates in Chicago, the Sox drew 391,335 for an average of 6,632 per game). Selig felt this fan support lent legitimacy to his quest for a Milwaukee franchise, and he went into the 1968 owners meetings with high hopes.\nThose hopes were dashed when National League franchises were awarded to San Diego (the Padres) and Montreal (the Expos), and American League franchises were awarded to Kansas City (the Royals) and Seattle (the Pilots). That last franchise, however, would figure very prominently in Selig's future.\nHaving failed to gain a major league franchise for Milwaukee through expansion, Selig turned his efforts to purchasing and relocating an existing club. His search began close to home, with the White Sox themselves. According to Selig, he had a handshake agreement with Allyn to purchase the Pale Hose and move them north. The American League, unwilling to surrender Chicago to the National League, vetoed the sale, and Allyn sold the franchise to his brother John.\nFrustrated in these efforts, Selig shifted his focus to another American League team, the expansion Seattle Pilots.\n1969–70: Roots in Seattle.\nSeattle initially had a lot going for it when it joined the American League in 1969. Like Milwaukee, Seattle had long been a hotbed for minor league baseball and was home to the Seattle Rainiers, one of the pillars of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). The Cleveland Indians had almost moved to Seattle in the early 1960s. Many of the same things that attracted the Indians made Seattle a plum choice for an expansion team. Seattle was the third-biggest metropolitan area on the West Coast (behind Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area). The addition of a third team on the West Coast also would balance out the addition of Kansas City. Also, there was no real competition from other pro teams. While Seattle had just landed the NBA's SuperSonics, the NBA was not in the same class as baseball was in terms of popularity at the time.\nThe front man for the franchise was Dewey Soriano, a former Rainiers pitcher and general manager and former president of the PCL. In an ominous sign of things to come, Soriano had to ask William R. Daley, who had owned the Indians at the time they flirted with Seattle, to furnish much of the expansion fee. In return, Daley bought 47 percent of the stock—the largest stake in the club. He became chairman of the board while Soriano served as president.\nHowever, a couple of factors were beyond the Pilots' control. They (alongside with the Montreal Expos, San Diego Padres and Kansas City Royals) were originally not set to start play until 1971. But the date was moved up to 1969 under pressure from Sen. Stuart Symington of Missouri. Professional baseball had been played in Kansas City for all but two years in the 20th century until the A's left for Oakland after the 1967 season, and the prospect of having Kansas City wait three years for its return was not acceptable to Symington. Also, the Pilots had to pay the PCL US$1 million (equivalent to $ million in ) to compensate for the loss of one of its most successful franchises. After King County voters approved a bond for a domed stadium (what would become the Kingdome, which opened in 1976) in 1968, the Seattle Pilots were officially born. California Angels executive Marvin Milkes was hired as general manager, and St. Louis Cardinals coach Joe Schultz became manager.\nTo the surprise of no one outside Seattle (Schultz and Milkes actually thought they could finish third in the newly formed AL West), the Pilots were terrible. They won their very first game, and then their home opener three days later, but only won five more times in the first month. Despite this, Schultz managed to keep his patchwork team competitive for much of the early part of the season; they were within striking distance of .500 for much of the spring, and were actually six games out of first as late as June 28. However, a 9–20 July ended any realistic hope of contention, and a 6–20 August crumbled them to last place for good. They finished with a record of 64–98, 33 games out of first.\nHowever, the team's poor play was the least of its troubles. The most obvious problem was Sick's Stadium. The longtime home of the Rainiers, it had been considered one of the best ballparks in minor league baseball. By the 1960s, however, it was considered far behind the times. While a condition of MLB awarding the Pilots to Seattle was that Sick's had to be expanded to 30,000 seats by the start of the 1969 season, only 17,000 seats were ready due to numerous delays. The scoreboard was not ready until the eve of opening day. While it was expanded to 25,000 by June, the added seats had obstructed views. Water pressure was almost nonexistent after the seventh inning, especially with crowds above 10,000. Attendance was so poor (678,000) that the Pilots were almost out of money by the end of the season. The team's new stadium was slated to be built at the Seattle Center, but a petition by stadium opponents ground the project to a halt. By the end of the season, it was obvious that the Pilots would not survive long enough to move to their new stadium without new ownership. It was also obvious that the move would have to happen quickly, as Sick's Stadium was completely inadequate even for temporary use.\nDuring the offseason, Soriano crossed paths with Selig. They met in secret for over a month after the end of the season, and during Game 1 of the World Series, Soriano agreed to sell the Pilots to Selig for US$10 to $13 million (equivalent to $ million in ), depending on the source.\nSelig would then move the team to Milwaukee and rename it the Brewers. However, the owners turned it down in the face of pressure from Washington's two senators, Warren Magnuson and Henry (Scoop) Jackson, as well as state attorney general Slade Gorton. MLB asked Soriano and Daley to find a local buyer. Local theater chain owner Fred Danz came forward in October 1969 with a $10 million deal (equivalent to $ million in ), but it fizzled when the Bank of California called in a $4 million loan (equivalent to $ million in ) it had made to Soriano and Daley for startup costs.\nIn January 1970, Westin Hotels owner Eddie Carlson put together a nonprofit group to buy the team. However, the owners rejected the idea almost out of hand, since it would have devalued the other clubs' worth. A more traditional deal came one vote short of approval.\nAfter a winter and spring full of court action, the Pilots reported for spring training under new manager Dave Bristol unsure of where they would play. The owners had given tentative approval to the Milwaukee group, but the state of Washington got an injunction on March 17 to stop the deal. Soriano immediately filed for bankruptcy – a move intended to forestall any post-sale legal action. At the bankruptcy hearing a week later, Milkes testified there was not enough money to pay the coaches, players and office staff. Had Milkes been more than 10 days late in paying the players, they would have all become free agents and left Seattle without a team for the 1970 season. With this in mind, Federal Bankruptcy Referee Sidney C. Volinn declared the Pilots bankrupt on March 31—seven days before Opening Day—clearing the way for them to move to Milwaukee. The team's equipment had been sitting in Provo, Utah with the drivers awaiting word on whether to drive toward Seattle or Milwaukee.\nMuch of the story of the Seattle Pilots' only year in existence is told in Jim Bouton's classic baseball book \"Ball Four\" (1970).\nAfter a lawsuit from the City of Seattle, King County, and the State of Washington was filed against the American League for breach of contract, the Pilots were eventually replaced by another expansion team, the Seattle Mariners, who began play in 1977.\n1970–1977: Early years in Milwaukee.\nWith final approval to move to Milwaukee coming less than a week before Opening Day, Selig's efforts to promote the team were significantly hamstrung. The most visible evidence was in the uniforms. Selig's original intention had been to adopt navy and red as the team colors, hearkening back to the minor league club (souvenir buttons sold at White Sox games at County Stadium featured the major league club's logo in that color combination). However, due to the late start, the club was forced to make do with the Pilots' blue and gold palette. That color combination, in various shades, is still used by the club. With no time to order new uniforms, the club had to remove the Pilots logo from team uniforms and replace them with Brewers logos. In fact, the outline of the old Pilots logo could still be seen on the Brewers' uniforms. The short notice (along with their geographical location) also forced the Brewers to assume the Pilots' old place in the AL West. While this resulted in natural rivalries with the White Sox and Twins, it also meant the Brewers faced some of the longest road trips in baseball, traveling to the Angels and Athletics for three series each per season.\nUnder the circumstances, the Brewers' 1970 season was over before it started, and they finished 65–97. They would not have a winning season until 1978.\nSelig brought back former Milwaukee Braves catcher (and fan favorite) Del Crandall in 1972 to manage the club. In 1972, the Brewers were shifted to the AL East when the second edition of the Washington Senators moved to Arlington, Texas and became the Texas Rangers.\nIt was during this period that Milwaukee County Stadium gained its reputation for fun as well as baseball. Then-team vice president Dick Hackett hired Frank Charles to play the Wurlitzer organ during the games, and Hackett introduced team mascots Bernie and Bonnie Brewer.\nOn November 2, 1974, the Brewers orchestrated a trade that brought one of the most beloved Braves back to Milwaukee, sending outfielder Dave May and a player to be named later (minor league pitcher Roger Alexander) to Atlanta for Hank Aaron. Although not the player he was in his prime, Aaron brought prestige to the young club, and the opportunity to be a designated hitter allowed Aaron to extend his playing career two more seasons.\n1978–1983: The Glory Years of Bambi's Bombers and Harvey's Wallbangers.\nFollowing the 1977 season, the Brewers made two big hires that turned the previously underachieving Brewers into perennial contenders. Harry Dalton was hired as the club's general manager and he, in turn, hired Baltimore Orioles pitching coach George Bamberger as the Brewers' third manager in their brief history. Bamberger immediately turned the Brewers into pennant contenders in 1978. The team won 93 games, an astonishing 26 game improvement from the previous season. The Brewers finished in third place in the AL East, 6.5 games behind the first place New York Yankees. Dalton built a winning club with a combination of home-grown players like Robin Yount, Paul Molitor, and Gorman Thomas, as well as getting players that were cast-offs from other teams that became major contributors like Cecil Cooper, Ben Oglivie, and Mike Caldwell.\nThe next season, Milwaukee won 95 games and finished second in the East behind the Baltimore Orioles on the strength of their home run power, led by Oglivie (who led the league in homers in 1980 along with Reggie Jackson), Cooper, and Thomas (who hit a then club-record 45 home runs in 1979, since surpassed by Prince Fielder's 50 homers in 2007). Because of the team's slugging ability and the nickname of their manager Bamberger, the Brewers were nicknamed \"Bambi's Bombers\".\nAs 1980 began, the Brewers and their fans were optimistic about becoming pennant winners, but the team scuffled during the season, partially due to Bamberger suffering a heart attack and having to be replaced by Buck Rodgers. The Brewers fell back to third place in 1980, largely due to the lack of an effective bullpen. Determined to get a proven relief pitcher, general manager Dalton made a huge offseason trade with the St. Louis Cardinals, sending outfielder Sixto Lezcano and three minor league pitchers to the Cardinals in exchange for Rollie Fingers, Pete Vuckovich, and Ted Simmons, all of whom became key parts of the Brewers future success.\nThe Brewers won the second half of the 1981 season (divided because of a players' strike) and played the Yankees in a playoff mini-series they ultimately lost. It was the first playoff appearance for the franchise. Rollie Fingers had one of the greatest seasons for a relief pitcher that season, saving 28 games in the shortened season and sporting an astonishing 1.04 ERA, earning him both the MVP and Cy Young Awards in the American League.\nIn 1982, the Brewers were considered heavy favorites to win the AL East, but by June, the team had fallen to 23–24 and signs had shown that the players were having problems playing under manager Buck Rodgers. Taking a gamble, the Brewers fired Rodgers and replaced him with hitting coach Harvey Kuenn. The team immediately excelled under Kuenn's low-key managerial style and gained a new nickname as Harvey's Wallbangers, a play on the drink Harvey Wallbanger and the team's manager's name. The Brewers went 72–43 under Kuenn for the rest of the season and went wild offensively, clubbing a then club-record 216 home runs during the season. The Brewers alone had three players finish in the top five in the league in home runs with Gorman Thomas, who led the league with 39, Ben Oglivie, who hit 34, and Cecil Cooper, who hit 32. Late in the season, to try to ensure the Brewers' pennant chase, the team made one last trade on August 30 for Don Sutton. That trade would become even more important on the final game of the regular season between the Brewers and the Baltimore Orioles, with both teams tied for first place in the AL East. Don Sutton started against Jim Palmer and the Brewers won 10–2, thanks to Robin Yount hitting two clutch home runs, clinching the AL East Division. The Brewers finished the season 95–67, the best record in baseball that year.\nThe Brewers faced the California Angels in the 1982 American League Championship Series and lost the first two games in California, but then rallied to win the next two games back in Milwaukee, setting up the pivotal Game 5, with the winner being the American League Champions. Down 3–2 in the 7th, Cecil Cooper hit a clutch 2-run single to put the Brewers on top and proved to be a game winner. The Brewers became the first team to win the American League Championship Series when down two games to none.\nThe Brewers then played the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series, which was seen as a match-up of contrasting playing styles, as the Cardinals' offensive style was speed and defense, whereas the Brewers' offense was power hitting. Affectionately called \"The Sud-Way series, wordplay for subway series and parodying the two cities as homes of major breweries (Miller Brewing Company in Milwaukee and Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis) the Brew Crew won Game One 10–0, thanks to Paul Molitor's World Series record 5 hits and a complete game shutout by Mike Caldwell. The Cardinals won the next two games and seemed to have Game 4 in complete control until the Brewers rallied for six runs in the 7th to win the game 7–5. The Brewers then won Game Five 6–4, giving them a 3–2 series lead, but the Cardinals trounced Don Sutton winning Game 6 13–1, and rallied for three runs late in Game 7 to win the Series, 4 games to 3. Many point to the lack of a bullpen for their downfall, as the Brewers had the lead in five of the seven games. Ace closer Rollie Fingers missed the playoffs due to a torn muscle in his throwing arm that not only kept him out for the entire playoffs but also would have him miss the entire 1983 season.\nThe Brewers had many individual accomplishments during their two playoff years, as both in 1981 and 1982, Brewer players won both the AL MVP and Cy Young Awards, with Rollie Fingers winning both awards in 1981, and Robin Yount winning the MVP and Pete Vuckovich winning the Cy Young in 1982.\n1984–1993: Rollercoaster, riding the highs and lows.\nFollowing their two playoff years, the club quickly retreated to the bottom of the standings, never finishing higher than fifth (out of seven) in their division from 1984 to 1986. Hope was restored in 1987 when, guided by rookie manager Tom Trebelhorn, the team began the year with a 13-game winning streak. Unfortunately, they followed that hot start with a 12-game skid in May. But \"Team Streak\" eventually posted a strong third-place finish. Highlights of the year included Paul Molitor's 39-game hitting streak and what is still the only no-hitter in team history, pitched by Juan Nieves on April 15.\nOn that day, Nieves became the first (and so far, only) Brewer and first Puerto Rican-born Major Leaguer to pitch a no-hitter, defeating the Baltimore Orioles 7–0 at Memorial Stadium. The final out came on a climactic diving catch in right-center field by Robin Yount of a line drive hit by Eddie Murray. The game also was the first time the Orioles were no-hit at Memorial Stadium. Yount later recalled at a Brewers banquet that he did not have to dive to catch the line drive hit by Murray but figured ending the game with a diving catch would be the icing on the cake for Nieves' no-hitter. Part of the Brewers' resurgence came from cultivating a new crop of young stars in their farm system, like pitchers Teddy Higuera and Dan Plesac, and position players B.J. Surhoff, Dale Sveum, and Rob Deer.\nIn 1988 the team had another strong season, finishing only two games out of first (albeit with a lesser record than the previous year) in a close playoff race with four other clubs. Following this year, the team slipped, posting mediocre records from 1989 through 1991, after which Trebelhorn was fired. In 1992, reminiscent of the resurgence which greeted Trebelhorn's arrival in 1987, the Brewers rallied behind the leadership of rookie manager Phil Garner and posted their best record since their World Series year in 1982, finishing the season 92–70 and in second place, four games behind that year's eventual World Champion Toronto Blue Jays. As a bit of a shocker for Brewers fans, who were used to the team sporting several power hitters, the Brewers in 1992 instead led the American League with 256 \"stolen bases\", while hitting only 82 home runs, with only two players (Greg Vaughn and Paul Molitor) hitting more than 12 for the year. Despite not making the playoffs, the Brewers had some other memorable moments, as Pat Listach hit .290 and stole 54 bases while winning the AL Rookie of the Year award, while Robin Yount got his 3000th career hit. 1992 proved to be the end of an era for the Brewers, as teammates Robin Yount, Paul Molitor, and Jim Gantner, who had been together since 1978, would go their separate ways, as Molitor left the Brewers for the Toronto Blue Jays, Gantner retired, and Yount would only last one more season before retiring in 1993.\nThe hope of additional pennant races was quickly dashed, as the club plummeted to the bottom of the standings in 1993, finishing an abysmal 26 games out of first. Since 1992, highlights were few and far between as the franchise failed to produce a winning season, having not fielded a competitive team because of a combination of bad management and financial constraints that limit the team relative to the resources available to other, larger-market clubs.\nAs the 1990s came to a close, the Brewers were on their way to becoming a perennial doormat. A lack of good management and an aging ballpark in old County Stadium, were both becoming stark problems for the Brewers and many fans began to wonder if the Brewers would ever become contenders again.\n1994–1998: Taking it National.\nIn 1994, Major League Baseball adopted a new, expanded playoff system. This change would necessitate a restructuring of each league from two divisions into three. The Brewers were transferred from the old AL East division to the newly created AL Central. (Due to the baseball strike, however, the new-look playoffs and World Series did not materialize that year.)\nIn March 1995, two new franchises—the Arizona Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Devil Rays—were awarded by Major League Baseball, to begin play in 1998. It was decided to add one new team to each league. At the time, however, MLB did not want to have an odd number of teams per league because they would either have to give teams many more off-days than in the past, or interleague play would have to be extended year-round, or both (14 years later however, another realignment would \"cause\" there to be an odd number of teams in each league with year-round interleague play). In order for MLB officials to continue the existing schedule, where teams play almost every day and where interleague play is limited to a few days per year, both leagues would need to carry an even number of teams. The decision was made to have one existing club switch leagues.\nThis realignment was widely considered to have great financial benefit to the club moving. However, to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, Commissioner (then club owner) Bud Selig decided another team should have the first chance to switch leagues. The Kansas City Royals of the American League's Central Division were asked first, but they decided not to move over to the National League's Central Division. The choice then fell to the Brewers, who, on November 6, 1997, elected to move to the National League's Central Division. At the same time, the Detroit Tigers agreed to move from the AL East to the AL Central (to replace Milwaukee). The Tampa Bay Devil Rays joined the AL East and the Arizona Diamondbacks joined the NL West. Had the Brewers elected not to move to the National League, the Minnesota Twins would have been offered the opportunity next.\nMilwaukee had formerly been a National League town, having been the home of the Braves for 13 seasons (1953–1965) until their relocation to Atlanta. With the Brewers having joined the National League, their pitchers would be forced to bat with the NL not adopting the designated hitter at the time of the move. The Brewers would resume playing with a DH full-time in and from onward after the NL officially adopted the rule.\nCoincidentally, the Houston Astros, who were also in the NL Central at the time of the Brewers' league switch, would join the American League in 2013. That gave the two leagues the same number of teams (15), but necessitated expanded interleague play because of the odd number of teams that were present in each league.\n1999–2003: Building Miller Park.\nAs early as 1993, Brewers owner Bud Selig had talked of a new ballpark for the Brewers to replace Milwaukee County Stadium, which had become heavily outdated and antiquated and did not have luxury suites.\nBy 1996, the club was set to build a new ballpark near the site of County Stadium, which would have a retractable roof to counter the unpredictable Wisconsin weather in the spring and autumn. It also helped to bring more fans and their families from all around Wisconsin to come to games with a practical guarantee of no rain-outs, bring in more potential revenue for the club.\nThe future American Family Field was opened as \"Miller Park\" in 2001, built to replace Milwaukee County Stadium. The stadium was built with US$310 million of public funds (equivalent to $ million in ), which drew some controversy at the time. It is the only sporting facility in the United States to have a fan-shaped retractable roof. Miller Park has a seating capacity of 41,900, along with standing room of 43,000, which is 10,000 fewer seats than County Stadium. In 2021, the stadium was renamed to \"American Family Field\".\nThe park was to have opened a year earlier, but an accident during its construction that resulted in the deaths of three workers forced a year's delay and incurred US$50 to $75 million in damage. On July 14, 1999, the three men lost their lives when the Lampson \"Big Blue\" crane, one of the largest in the world, collapsed while trying to lift a right field roof panel. A statue commemorating the men now stands between the home plate entrance to Miller Park and Helfaer Field.\nThe Brewers made renovations to Miller Park before the 2006 campaign, adding both LED scoreboards from Daktronics, a company in Brookings, South Dakota, in left field and on the second-tier of the stadium, as well as a picnic area in right field, shortening the distance of the right-field fence. The picnic area was an immediate hit and sold out for the season before the year began.\nThe ballpark has featured another fan favorite, The Racing Sausages, in a race of five costumed mascots, held before the bottom of the sixth inning.\nWhile the Brewers' new park was a hit, the club itself was not successful playing in it, as the Brewers finished the season even worse than their previous seasons, going 68–94 in their first season at Miller Park. The Brewers finished 2002 even worse, finishing with a dismal 56–106 record, 41 games out of first place, the worst record in franchise history.\nIn 2003, the Brewers hired Doug Melvin as general manager, who in turn brought in Ned Yost, coach with the Atlanta Braves and a former member of the 1982 American League Champion Brewers, as manager. Though the Brewers only went 68–94 in 2003, the Brewers did raise hopes with a winning record in August during the season.\n2004–present: Attanasio era.\n2004–2006: Building a winner.\nOn January 16, 2004, Selig announced that his ownership group was putting the team up for sale, to the great relief of many fans who were unhappy with the team's lackluster performance and poor management by his daughter, Wendy Selig-Prieb, over the previous decade. In September 2004, the Brewers announced they had reached a verbal agreement with Los Angeles investment banker Mark Attanasio to purchase the team for a reported US$223 million. The sale to Attanasio was completed on January 13, 2005, at Major League Baseball's quarterly owners meeting. Other members of Attanasio's ownership group include private equity investor John Canning Jr., David Uihlein, Harris Turer and Stephen Marcus, all of whom were involved with the previous ownership group led by Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig. Since taking over the franchise, Attanasio has worked hard to build bridges with Milwaukee baseball fans, including giving away every seat to the final home game of 2005 free of charge and bringing back the classic \"ball and glove\" logo of the club's glory days on \"Retro Friday\" home games, during which they also wear versions of the team's old pinstriped uniforms.\n2004.\nThe Brewers caused a stir in the first half of the 2004 season, when the team had a winning record in the first half of the season, even briefly being in 1st place in the NL Central. However, lack of a productive offense doomed the Brewers and the club sunk back to last place, finishing the season 67–94. The Brewers did have some bright moments during the season with pitcher Ben Sheets striking out 18 Atlanta Braves in one game and the Brewers coming back from a 9-run deficit to beat the Cincinnati Reds.\nAfter the 2004 season, with Mark Attanasio now in control of the franchise, the Brewers were finally able to spend some money on free agents. The Brewers first significant free-agent signing in many years was veteran catcher Damian Miller, a Wisconsin native, and to address a need for better run production, the Brewers traded speedy outfielder Scott Podsednik and relief pitcher Luis Vizcaíno to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for slugging outfielder Carlos Lee. The arrival of Lee gave Brewer fans even higher hopes that better seasons were on the way for the Brewers.\n2005.\nIn 2005, under Attanasio's ownership, the team finished 81–81 to secure its first non-losing record since 1992. True to form, Carlos Lee provided the Brewers with much needed run support, hitting 32 home runs and driving in 112. Starting pitcher Chris Capuano also had a stellar season, going 18–12 with a 3.99 ERA, the most wins by a Brewer pitcher since Pete Vuckovich won 18 games in 1982.\nWith a solid base of young talent assembled over the past five years, including Prince Fielder, Rickie Weeks, J. J. Hardy and Corey Hart, the Brewers showed renewed competitiveness. Further encouraging this sentiment, the Brewers had hired former stars Yount (bench coach; resigned in November 2006) and Dale Sveum (third base coach), both very popular players for the Brewers in the '80s.\n2006.\nIn 2006, the Brewers' play disappointed fans, players, and management. They began the season 5–1 and had a 14–11 record at the end of April. On Mother's Day Bill Hall hit a walk off home run with his mother in the stands, a play that was shown on ESPN throughout the summer. However, soon starters JJ Hardy, Rickie Weeks, and Corey Koskie were lost to injuries, and the Brewers were forced to trade for veteran infielders David Bell and Tony Graffanino. They also suffered setbacks when losing starting pitchers Ben Sheets and Tomo Ohka for a substantial amount of time, forcing Triple A starters Ben Hendrickson, Dana Eveland, Carlos Villanueva, and Zach Jackson into starting roles at different points in the year. Shortly before the All Star break the Brewers climbed to one game above .500, but then lost their next three to the Chicago Cubs and would never return to .500. After the All Star break closer Derrick Turnbow blew four straight save opportunities. This led to the Brewers being far enough down in the standings that management decided to trade free agent-to-be Carlos Lee to the Texas Rangers for closer Francisco Cordero, outfielder Kevin Mench, and two minor league prospects. Cordero replaced Turnbow as the Brewers closer and had immediate success, converting his first 13 save opportunities. On August 24 the Brewers completed a sweep of the Colorado Rockies to climb to less than five games out in both the NL Central Division and NL Wild Card races, but then Milwaukee went on a 10-game losing streak that ended any postseason hope. The Brewers did rebound and play well in September including a four-game sweep of San Francisco, but it was too little too late. The Brewers ended the season with a 75–87 record.\nAt the end of the season, Attanasio stated that he and General Manager Doug Melvin would have to make some decisions about returning players for the 2007 season. With young players waiting in the minor leagues, during the off-season the key additions were starting pitcher and 2006 NLCS MVP Jeff Suppan, starter Claudio Vargas, reliever Greg Aquino, catcher Johnny Estrada, and returning Brewer Craig Counsell. The Brewers parted ways with 2006 starters Doug Davis and Tomo Ohka, as well as fan favorite Jeff Cirillo, who wanted more playing time with another team.\n2007: The return to respectability.\nBefore the 2007 season, the buzz surrounding the Brewers greatly increased. They were dubbed a \"sleeper team\" and \"contenders in the NL\" by numerous sports analysts and magazines. ESPN's Peter Gammons and Dan Patrick both picked The Brewers to beat out the defending champion Cardinals and re-vamped Chicago Cubs to win the NL Central. To celebrate the successful 1982 Milwaukee Brewers team, the franchise decided to have the 2007 season be named as the \"25th Anniversary of '82\", with more fan giveaways than any other Major League Baseball team except the Pittsburgh Pirates, and more discounts and deals than any other time in Brewers' history.\nESPN.com's lead story on August 29 stated: \"... Then there are the Brewers. The strange, impossible-to-figure-out Brewers. They once had the best record in the majors, were 14 games over .500 twice, and led the division by as many as 8½ games on June 23. Since then, and there's no nice way of saying it; they've reeked.\" The Brewers cast this negativity to the side, and rebounded in September. Despite poor performances from the usually steady Chris Capuano and more nagging injuries to Ben Sheets, the Brewers found themselves in a heated pennant race with Chicago's North Siders. The team's playoff drive took a hit late in the year, however, losing three of four games in a crucial series in Atlanta, dropping the Brewers to a season-high 3.5 games out of first. The Brewers won the first two games of their final homestand of the season to pull within two games of the Cubs, but faced a near impossible task with the club's elimination number down to only three and the wild card leading Padres coming to town. The club played well, but the Cubs clinched on the final Friday of the season. On September 29 the Brewers beat Padres 4–3 in extra innings to secure a winning season. The game was tied in the ninth inning by a triple by Tony Gwynn Jr. in a highlight reel play that was repeated often during the 2007 post season. That win, and the win the next day, by the Brewers kept the Padres from advancing to the playoffs. The irony, of course, being that Gwynn's father was arguably the most popular Padre of all-time, and Tony Gwynn Jr. would later be traded to the Padres in 2009. Milwaukee finished at a respectable 83–79, only two games behind Chicago, the club's best finish since 1992.\nFirst baseman Prince Fielder made history in 2007, becoming the first Brewer and the youngest player ever to reach the 50 home run mark in a single season. For his effort, he finished third in the 2007 National League Most Valuable Player voting, garnering 284 total points including 5 first place votes. Fielder was also awarded the Hank Aaron Award for reaching the amazing single year record. Third baseman Ryan Braun was also rewarded for his historic season by being named 2007 NL Rookie of the Year.\n2008: The return to the postseason.\nThe Brewers came into 2008 with hopes of ending the team's 26-year playoff drought, adding several veterans to the team in outfielder Mike Cameron and catcher Jason Kendall, as well as relief pitchers Éric Gagné and Salomón Torres. The Brewers started April on a solid winning note, but suffered two big blows in their pitching rotation when Dave Bush was demoted to AAA Nashville, and Yovani Gallardo suffered a potential season ending knee injury. The team dropped below .500 by the middle of May, capped off by a sweep from the Boston Red Sox.\nThe Brewers rebounded in June as Salomón Torres took over as closer, becoming a big success, and soon climbed back into contention. As June came to a close, the Brewers made their biggest move for playoff contention as they traded four prospects, most notably Matt LaPorta, to the Cleveland Indians for CC Sabathia. General Manager Doug Melvin summed up the trade by saying, \"We are going for it.\" The Brewers came into the All-Star break with a 52–43 record, still third behind the Cubs and Cardinals. Ben Sheets was named starting pitcher for the National League in the All-Star game, and Ryan Braun also started at left field. Corey Hart was named to the team in the Final Vote.\nThe Brewers came out of the All-Star break with a bang as they won their first seven games back, all of them on the road, sweeping first the Giants and then the Cardinals, taking over first place in the Wild Card standings. The Brewers came into the end of July still in the hunt for the division, but the front running Cubs swept the Brewers in a four-game set at Miller Park. While the Brewers were still holding on to the Wild Card lead, the division was never seriously challenged for the remainder of the year.\nThe Brewers came off the sweep from the Cubs with an amazing August, winning 20 of 28 games in the month. Sabathia made history by becoming the first pitcher in over 90 years to win his first 9 games after being traded mid-season. With a steady five game lead for the Wild Card, the hope of a playoff spot seemed secured, but the Brewers struggled in September, first getting swept by the New York Mets, and then just over a week later, getting swept in four games by the Philadelphia Phillies, losing their lead in the Wild Card. Feeling a change was needed, the Brewers fired manager Ned Yost with just 12 games left in the season, replacing him with Brewers third base coach Dale Sveum. Sveum named Garth Iorg as his replacement as third base coach, and made Robin Yount the new bench coach, replacing Ted Simmons. With the final 6x games at home, the Brewers were still in the hunt for the Wild Card behind the New York Mets. They first swept the Pittsburgh Pirates, thanks to walk-off home runs by Prince Fielder and Ryan Braun, tying the New York Mets for the Wild Card lead with 3 games to go against the NL Central division champion Chicago Cubs.\nThe Brewers took the first game thanks to a pinch-hit home run by Rickie Weeks and stellar relief pitching by Seth McClung. The Cubs took the second game, with the Wild Card race still in a dead tie. CC Sabathia was called to pitch his third game in a week, and was stellar, pitching a complete game, while Ryan Braun hit possibly the biggest home run in club history with a 2-run shot in the 8th inning to break a 1–1 tie. The Brewers won 3–1 while the New York Mets lost to the Florida Marlins 4–2, sealing the Brewers the Wild Card spot.\n2008 NLDS.\nThe Brewers finished the 2008 season one game ahead of the New York Mets in the wild card race with a final record of 90–72, and faced the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLDS. This was the first time the Brewers reached the playoffs since 1982.\nThe Brewers played their first postseason game in 26 years on October 1. Pitcher Yovani Gallardo made his first postseason start and only his second start since coming off the disabled list in late September. The Brewers lost the first game of the NLDS 3–1 on a dominant performance by Phillies pitcher Cole Hamels. Hamels allowed only two hits and struck out nine Brewers batters in eight shutout innings. The Brewers mounted a comeback in the 9th inning as closer Brad Lidge allowed two hits, a walk, and a run to score. However, Brewers right fielder Corey Hart struck out with runners on second and third to end the game.\nThe Brewers hosted Game 3, which was the first playoff game ever hosted at Miller Park and the first in Milwaukee since Game 5 of the 1982 World Series. The Brewers won, but were eliminated in Game 4, ending the Brewers season while the Phillies went on to win the World Series.\n2009: Missing playoffs.\nDuring the off-season, the Brewers lost C.C. Sabathia when he filed for free agency and signed a lucrative deal with the New York Yankees. Despite the loss of a starting pitcher in Sabathia, the Brewers were able to sign all-time save leader Trevor Hoffman. The Brewers were not able to build on their success from the year prior falling below .500 but were witness to Prince Fielder setting the all-time franchise record for RBI.\n2010.\nThe Brewers attempted to shore up their starting pitching with the signing of free agent Doug Davis, but the Brewers still struggled. After just one month, the Brewers released Jeff Suppan, Doug Davis got injured, and Trevor Hoffman struggled to get saves. The only bright spots of the season was the Brewers' hitting. The Brewers were the only team in baseball to have three players with 100+ RBIs in Ryan Braun, Casey McGehee, and Corey Hart. The Brewers lost 9 games in a row in May and never fully recovered, finishing the season 77–85, which was good for 3rd place in the National League Central division, behind the Cincinnati Reds and the St. Louis Cardinals. The only other bright spots of the season was Trevor Hoffman getting his 600th career save and the emergence of new closer John Axford. After the season, the Brewers chose not to renew the contract of manager Ken Macha. In October, just days after the World Series, the Brewers hired Ron Roenicke, bench coach of the Los Angeles Angels, to be the Brewers' new manager.\n2011 season: NL Central champs.\nWith the trades for Shaun Marcum and Zack Greinke, the Brewers were tabbed by many experts as favorites to not only win the NL Central Division, but also contenders for the National League pennant. The Brewers did suffer some early losses in spring training, as Zack Greinke was lost to a rib injury that would keep him out for a month, and Corey Hart was out for the first half of April with a hamstring injury, which caused the Brewers to make a last-minute trade at the end of spring training for Washington Nationals outfielder Nyjer Morgan.\nThe Brewers struggled during the first month of the season, losing their first 4 games of the season and fell as far down as to 5th place in the NL Central Division, but the Brewers rebounded starting at the end of May and throughout June and early July. By the All-Star Break, the Brewers were in 2nd place in the division, behind Pittsburgh and St. Louis. To address some needed bullpen depth, the Brewers made a shocking trade just hours after the All-Star Game, trading two Class-A prospects to the New York Mets for ace reliever Francisco Rodriguez, who immediately became the Brewers set-up reliever for closer John Axford.\nThe Brewers went on a hot winning stretch through the month of August and by the beginning of September were games ahead of St. Louis for the NL Central lead. Though the Brewers scuffled some in September, the Brewers clinched the division on September 26, beating the Florida Marlins 4–1. The Brewers finished the season with a 96–66 record, the best record in franchise history.\nAlong with their team accomplishments, the Brewers had many individual achievements from their players. Ryan Braun finished the season with 33 homers and 33 steals while finishing second in the National League in batting average, hitting .332 while Prince Fielder finished second in the league in both home runs and RBIs, hitting 38 home runs while driving in 120.\nThe Brewers starting pitching was also drastically better than 2010. Each of the Brewers 5 regular starters had 10-plus wins during the regular season. Yovani Gallardo won 17 games, the most by a Brewer since 2005, Zack Greinke won 16 games despite missing one month, both Shawn Marcum and Randy Wolf won 13 games, and number five starter Chris Narveson won 11 games. It was the first time since 1982 that the Brewers had five pitchers with 10 or more wins in a season. The Brewers also used fewer starting pitchers than any team in baseball, using only six starting pitchers, with Marco Estrada filling in for 7 games when Greinke and later Narveson were out with injuries.\n2011 Postseason.\nThe Brewers faced the NL West Champion Arizona Diamondbacks in the NLDS and won the first two games at Miller Park, with Yovani Gallardo pitching 8 stellar innings in a 4–1 Game 1 win. The Diamondbacks won games 3 and 4 in Arizona, setting up a deciding Game 5 back in Miller Park. The Brewers had a 2–1 lead going into the 9th inning when closer John Axford blew his first save since April, giving up the lead. The Brewers went on to win the game and the series in the 10th inning on a base hit by Nyjer Morgan driving in Carlos Gomez for the winning run. The Brewers faced their divisional foe and the NL Wild Card winner, the St. Louis Cardinals, who had upset the favored Philadelphia Phillies in the NLDS. Many Brewer fans welcomed facing the Cardinals with the National League pennant at stake, with the Brewers and Cardinals having a growing rivalry, and also a chance for the Brewers to avenge their 1982 World Series defeat, which was at the hands of the Cardinals. The two teams split the first two games at Miller Park, then the Cardinals took two out of 3 games at Busch Stadium and won Game 6 to win the National League pennant and eventually the World Series against the Texas Rangers. Probably the biggest reason for the Brewers defeat was the downfall of their starting pitching. In their 11 postseason games, the Brewers starting pitchers only had three quality starts, with Yovani Gallardo accounting for two of them, both of which were in the NLDS. The other quality start was Randy Wolf in Game 4 of the NLCS.\n2012.\nIn the offseason, the Brewers would lose many of their spot players that had helped them during the season, such as Mark Kotsay, Jerry Hairston Jr., and Craig Counsell but their most notable loss was that of Prince Fielder, who would leave the team via free agency after having been a part of the Brewers organization for almost a decade. Fielder would end up signing with the Detroit Tigers. The Brewers would make two significant free agent signings during the off-season, signing shortstop Alex Gonzalez and third baseman Aramis Ramierez to improve the left side of the Brewers infield. The Brewers would also sign Japanese outfielder Norichika Aoki to bring some needed outfield depth.\nThe biggest news of all during the off-season, though, was the issue of the reigning NL MVP Ryan Braun apparently testing positive for PED's and facing a possible 50-game suspension. Braun would appeal the suspension and won on the basis that the test was not processed properly, making him the first player to win an appeal against a suspension regarding illegal substances.\nDespite the offseason losses and controversies, the Brewers fans still looked forward to the 2012 season with great optimism, as the Brewers, by the end of February, had sold over 1.5 million tickets, the most before the month of March. However, the Brewers started the season poorly, with a 40–45 record by the All-Star break. Poor bullpen play put the team even further out of contention by the end of July, which caused the Brewers to trade ace pitcher Zack Greinke to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in exchange for top minor league shortstop Jean Segura and two minor league relief pitchers.\nSuddenly, in mid-August, the Brewers went on a run to put themselves back in postseason contention. The bullpen started to turn itself around and the team was able to get production from several minor league call-ups, like Mike Fiers, Martin Maldonado, Jeff Bianchi, and Wily Peralta. Combined with stellar hitting of Ryan Braun, Aramis Ramírez, Corey Hart, and Jonathan Lucroy, the Brewers, from August 16 to September 23, won 26 of 35 games. However, the Brewers were eliminated from postseason contention on September 30, a 7–0 loss to the Houston Astros.\nThe Brewers still finished with a winning record in 2012, going 83–79, finishing in 3rd place in the NL Central behind Cincinnati and St. Louis.\n2013.\nThe Brewers hoped to become contenders again in 2013, and tried to shore up their starting pitching with the signing of free-agent Kyle Lohse, but the Brewers, after starting off well with a 14–11 record in April, fell flat with a 6–22 mark in May, and never regained momentum, finishing the season 74–88.\nFurther compounding the Brewers' fall during the season were nagging injuries to Aramis Ramírez, and also Ryan Braun's supposed involvement with the Biogenesis scandal, which resulted in Braun being suspended for the final 60 games of the regular season after he admitted to taking PEDs during the 2011 playoffs. Major League Baseball did not force Braun to surrender his 2011 National League MVP award.\nOn the field, the Brewers did have several individual performances that gave fans some hope for the coming seasons. Shortstop Jean Segura finished second in the National League with 44 stolen bases, and Carlos Gomez had a breakout season, batting .284 with 24 home runs, 40 stolen bases, and became the first Brewer since 1982 to win a Gold Glove award for his defensive play, and catcher Jonathan Lucroy had a stellar offensive season, hitting 18 home runs and driving in 82 RBIs.\n2014.\nFew experts considered the Brewers as contenders in the NL Central for 2014, even after the Brewers signed another free-agent starting pitcher in Matt Garza; most expected the Brewers to finish no better than 4th in the division. The team also improved their bullpen with resigning Francisco Rodriguez as closer, trading outfielder Nori Aoki to the Kansas City Royals in exchange for a young pitcher in Will Smith, and signing veteran slugging first baseman Mark Reynolds.\nThe Brewers started the season hot, going 20–7 in April, much to the surprise of many. The Brewers have showed much improved starting pitching, with a steady rotation in Yovani Gallardo, Kyle Lohse, Matt Garza, Wily Peralta, and Marco Estrada. In addition, Francisco Rodriguez regained his old form, successfully closing out his first 17 saves of the season, and Will Smith became virtually untouchable, sporting a 0.88 ERA in the first two months of the season.\nThough the Brewers showed some struggles in the months of May and July, the team continued to stay on top of the standings as one of the better teams in the National League, helped by an 18–10 record in June. By mid September, however, they had lost their division lead to the St. Louis Cardinals and were trailing behind the Pittsburgh Pirates in the National League Wild Card race.\nThe Brewers were in first place in the division from April 5 to September 1, but ultimately finished third in the division after a sub-.500 September, barely getting over .500 with an 82–80 record.\nA couple of standout performers for the Brewers came from Jonathon Lucroy, who finished with a .301 batting average and led the National League with 53 doubles and set a new Major League record for doubles by a catcher in a season with 48. Second-year pitcher Wily Peralta had a 17–11 record, while Kyle Lohse had a 13–9 record with 2 complete game shutouts.\n2015.\nThe offseason for the Brewers was relatively quiet, with only a couple of trades made where the Brewers parted with two starting pitchers. Marco Estrada was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for first baseman Adam Lind, and Yovani Gallardo, after 8 seasons with the Brewers and becoming the franchise's all-time strikeout leader, was traded to the Texas Rangers. During the offseason, Ryan Braun, who had his worst season ever during 2014 (.266 avg., 19 HR, and 81 RBI's), had surgery on his right thumb, which had bothered him all during the season and was thought to be the reason behind his dismal numbers. On the field, the Brewers' season went south almost immediately, going 5–17 in the month of April. On May 4, manager Ron Roenicke was fired and Craig Counsell was named interim manager, staying manager for the Brewers through the rest of the season, as the team finished 68–94.\n2016: Rebuilding.\nThe Brewers began a mode of rebuilding the team, with Doug Melvin stepping down as general manager and being replaced with Houston Astros assistant GM, David Stearns. Stearns kept interim manager Craig Counsell, making him the Brewers full-time manager, and traded away over half of the Brewers' 40-man roster from 2015 before the 2016 season came to a close. The Brewers finished the 2016 season with a 73–89 record, but had a 41–40 record at home, and had two players lead the National League in major offensive categories, with infielder Jonathan Villar leading the NL, and all of Major League Baseball, with 62 stolen bases, and first baseman Chris Carter tied for the NL lead in home runs, with 41. Ryan Braun also had a rebound season, with a .305 batting average, 30 home runs, 91 RBIs, and 16 stolen bases. The Brewers also traded away many franchise stars in exchange for prospects, such as Jonathan Lucroy and Carlos Gomez, and other starters, with the exception of Ryan Braun.\n2017.\nThe Brewers came into 2017 with minimal expectations other than continuing their rebuilding of the team. The team surprised many by finishing the month of April at .500, with encouraging performances from Eric Thames, Chase Anderson, Jesus Aguilar, and Travis Shaw. The Brewers continued to stay around .500 for the next two months, and took advantage of the struggles of the Cubs and Cardinals, and started July with a hot 7–2 start, putting the Brewers at 50–41 for the season, 5.5 games ahead of the Cubs in the NL Central at the All-Star break. The Brewers struggled after the All-Star break, going 3–11 for the rest of July, followed by a 6-game losing streak in the middle of August. The Brewers still stayed in the race for the Wild Card game, but fell short of the postseason and the NL Central Division, with an 86–76 record, which still was a surprise for many in the baseball community.\n2018.\nWith the opportunity to build off their surprising 2017 run, Brewers GM David Stearns worked on stocking up the Brewers roster for 2018, including signing pitchers Jhoulys Chacin and Junior Guerra, and outfielder Lorenzo Cain, who had originally started his MLB career in Milwaukee. The Brewers also traded for another outfielder, Christian Yelich, for four minor leaguers. The Brewers started 2018 well, helped by a stretch in May where they went 19–8 to put themselves on top in the NL Central division, taking advantage, once again, of early struggles for both the Cubs and Cardinals. However, the team struggled again in the middle of the season, going 40–39 through the months of June, July, and August. However, they were still in the playoff hunt, leading in the Wild Card, but were still 5 games behind the division-leading Cubs going into the final month of the season. The Brewers got hot again, going 19–7 in September, including winning 10 of their last 11 games, the last 8 in a row, to catch the Cubs. Christian Yelich led the offense, going on an offensive tear, including hitting clutch home runs in two of the final three games of the season against the Detroit Tigers. The Brewers tied the Cubs for the NL Central lead, resulting in a one-game playoff for the division title. The Brewers won 3–1, clinching their second division title of the decade, and only their 3rd in franchise history, finishing with a 96–67 record, tying the franchise record for wins in a season. The Brewers continued their hot run in the NLDS, against the Colorado Rockies, sweeping them in three games to advance to the NLCS, also achieving at least 12 wins in a row for only the second time in their history. The Brewers faced the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS, but the Brewers were unable to keep their late momentum, as the Dodgers bullpen was able to quiet the Brewers' bats, winning the National League pennant in seven games.\n2019.\nFollowing their amazing 2018 campaign, GM David Stearns worked more on adding more talent to the Brewers roster, including signing free agent catcher Yasmani Grandal and third baseman Mike Moustakas, each on one year contracts. The Brewers headed into the month of September with an overall record of 69–66, being four games behind the Cubs for the second wild card spot and trailing the Cardinals by six and a half games for the division lead. On September 25, the Brewers beat the Cincinnati Reds 9–2 to clinch a postseason spot for the sixth time in franchise history, knocking the Cubs out of playoff contention. It was also the first time the Brewers had made the postseason for a consecutive season since 1982. But in their final three regular season games, they were swept by the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field, which lead to the Brewers finishing 20–7 in September, 89–73 for the regular season, and finishing two games behind the NL Central Champion Cardinals. They ended up taking the second spot in the wild card. Therefore, the Brewers faced the eventual World Series champion Washington Nationals in the NL Wild Card Game in Washington D.C., where they lost 4–3.\n2020.\nAfter a frustrating end to the season, Brewers lost some key players in the offseason. Free agent Yasmani Grandal signed with the Chicago White Sox, Eric Thames signed with the Washington Nationals, and third baseman Mike Moustakas signed with the Cincinnati Reds. Their biggest move was extending former MVP Christian Yelich to a 9-year $215 million deal. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 season was shortened to 60 games and did not begin until late July. For the 2020 season, MLB expanded to a 16-game postseason with all teams playing in the first round. Brewers finished the season 29–31 tied with the San Francisco Giants, but the Brewers had a better record against their division opponents which made them eligible for the last spot in the playoffs. In the first round of the playoffs, the Brewers faced the Los Angeles Dodgers, who swept them in two games and went on to win the 2020 World Series.\n2021.\nWith a 4-game postseason losing streak, David Stearns helped out the infield by signing Kolten Wong and Travis Shaw. He tried signing third baseman Justin Turner but he extended with the Dodgers. During the season, Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo joined the Brewers ownership group.\nIn 2021, the Brewers earned their fourth consecutive postseason berth, winning the National League Central with a 95–67 record. Pitcher Corbin Burnes set an all-time record by starting the season with 58 strikeouts without issuing a walk. He also led the major leagues in ERA (2.43), strikeouts per nine innings (12.6), home runs per nine innings (0.4), and strikeout-to-walk ratio (6.88). For his amazing season, Burnes won the NL Cy Young Award. Josh Hader was another hardware recipient, becoming the Major League Baseball Reliever of the Year Award winner in the National League for the third time in four years. For the third straight season, the Brewers were eliminated in the postseason by the eventual World Series champions, as they lost the NLDS to the Atlanta Braves.\n2022.\nThe Brewers' winning ways continued through the first half of the 2022 season. On July 30, the team had a four-game lead in the National League Central. However, the Brewers then lost 21 of their next 35 games to fall games behind the St. Louis Cardinals. The Brewers were eliminated on October 3 and missed the postseason for the first time in five years."

        "title": "2007 International Darts League",
        "text": "The 2007 Tropicana International Darts League was the fifth and final edition of the International Darts League. It was held at the Triavium in Nijmegen, Netherlands from 4–12 May 2007. The tournament was sponsored by Tropicana — a Dutch-based soft drink manufacturer. Raymond van Barneveld entered the tournament as three-times and defending champion. As in 2006, it was a cross-code event featuring players from both the World Darts Federation and the Professional Darts Corporation.\nDarts history was made when the tournament became the first televised event to witness two nine dart finishes. On 8 May Phil Taylor hit his fourth perfect game on television against Raymond van Barneveld and the following night Tony O'Shea matched the effort against Adrian Lewis.\nDespite the presence of current BDO and PDC World Champions and four other former world champions in the field, none progressed beyond the quarter-finals. 36 year old Gary Anderson won his first major title with a 13–9 victory over fellow BDO/WDF player Mark Webster.\nPrize fund.\nThe total prize fund is €135,000 (plus €26,000 for a nine-dart finish)\n2007 controversy.\nThe staging of the 2007 IDL was filled with controversy. There were several format changes, disagreements and even court cases surrounding the event.\nIn 2006 the BDO secured an agreement for 28 of their players to participate in the event until 2010. However, as the popularity of the PDC circuit grew in the Netherlands, the organisers decided to renege on the deal and invite only 12 BDO players. The remaining 20 players would qualify from the PDC including their top 12 ranked players plus four wildcards and four from a PDC/PDPA qualifying event.\nThis led to a threat from the BDO to take court action against the organisers who wanted their agreement upholding. A compromise was reached and the organisers introduced a preliminary round. The original 16 BDO/WDF players who believed they had missed out were to be joined by a further four automatic qualifiers from the PDC Order of Merit and a further four players from an already confirmed qualifying event in April. This expanded the field from 32 to 56 players.\nHowever the sponsors of the four wildcard players (Michael van Gerwen, Mervyn King, Jelle Klaasen and Vincent van der Voort) were upset that their players had been relegated to the preliminary round when they felt they had an agreement to be automatically into the televised stages. The BDO also felt that all 28 of their players should not have to face a preliminary round. The dispute was resolved on April 25 when a Dutch court rejected the claims of the four wildcard players. Three of the players managed to qualify from the preliminary round with only van der Voort missing out.\nResults.\nPreliminary round.\nPlayed Friday 4 May 2007\nGroup One – Winner: Mervyn King\nGroup Two – Winner: Gary Robson\nGroup Three – Winner: Michael van Gerwen\nGroup Four – Winner: Ross Montgomery\nGroup Five – Winner: Barrie Bates\nGroup Six – Winner: Mark Dudbridge\nGroup Seven – Winner: Jelle Klaasen\nGroup Eight – Winner: Ronnie Baxter\nFirst round.\nPlayed Saturday 5 May to Monday 7 May\nSecond round.\nPlayed Tuesday 8 May to Thursday 10 May\n2007 format.\nThe field was scheduled to contain 56 players with 12 automatically from each organisation going into the group stages.

Malik took 12 for 84 in the match against Peshawar, while Akhtar took 12 for 117 against Combined Services.\nIn 1962-63 Rawalpindi reached the semi-finals of the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy, thanks largely to the bowling of the captain, Maqsood Ahmed, who took 34 wickets in the four matches at 9.29 (including 13 for 83 against Sargodha), and Mohammad Sabir, 28 at 11.42. Rawalpindi also reached the semi-finals in 1963–64.\nIn 1967-68 Rawalpindi reached the final of a competition for the first time, this time in the Ayub Trophy, losing by 10 wickets to Karachi Blues. Again the bowling was the team's strength. No batsman scored a century, but Javed Akhtar led the bowling with 24 wickets at 13.08 in the four matches.\n1970s and 1980s.\nThe six-team Punjab Governor's Gold Cup Tournament was held only once, in 1971–72, and Rawalpindi reached the final, losing to Punjab University. After a few years playing in other tournaments Rawalpindi returned to the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy in 1979–80, then took part in the expanded BCCP Patron's Trophy in 1983–84. They reached the semi-finals in 1983–84, when Mohammad Riaz took 13 for 59 in one of the preliminary matches against Lahore Division.\nIn 1980-81 they won the Patron's Trophy, winning all five of their group matches, receiving a walkover in their semi-final, and beating Karachi Blues in the final by eight wickets. However, the matches were later downgraded in status and are no longer considered to have been first-class.\nThe Patron's Trophy returned to first-class status in 1983–84. In 1984-85 Rawalpindi were beaten in the final by Karachi Whites. They reached the semi-finals in 1986–87. In 1988–89, after winning four of their seven matches, they played off in the final against Karachi, losing by 191 runs. Their leading player was Raja Sarfraz, who took 35 wickets at 16.45, including 12 for 120 against Multan.\n1990s and 2000s.\nRawalpindi reached the semi-finals of the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy in 1991-92 and 1993–94. In 1998-99 they drew a match against the touring Australians, Shakeel Ahmed taking 10 wickets and Naved Ashraf scoring 48 and 115 not out. They again reached the semi-finals of the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy in 2002–03, and continued thereafter to have reasonable success, without reaching the finals. In 2004-05 Bazid Khan, in one of the seven matches he played for Rawalpindi, hit Rawalpindi's highest-ever score, 300 not out, against Hyderabad. In 2009-10 Rashid Latif took 9 for 42 against Islamabad, which remained the Rawalpindi record for only two years.\n2010s.\nIn 2010-11 Rawalpindi finished third in Division One of the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy, with six wins from their 11 matches. Sadaf Hussain took 64 wickets at 16.12, including five or more wickets in an innings eight times, with match figures of 11 for 118 against Zarai Taraqiati Bank and 11 for 104 against Faisalabad. In 2011-12 they slipped to seventh, with four wins from 11 matches. Hussain was again the outstanding player, with 53 wickets at 20.37. He set two bowling records for Rawalpindi in the match against Habib Bank Limited when he took 9 for 37 in the first innings and 15 for 154 in the match. Habib Bank Limited nevertheless won by 131 runs. In 2012-13 Rawalpindi finished at the top of Group II, and were promoted into Group I for the 2013–14 season.\n2013-14.\nLed by Babar Naeem, who captained the team for several seasons, Rawalpindi began the 2013-14 Quaid-i-Azam Trophy by defeating Bahawalpur by an innings and 130 runs. They then beat Abbottabad by eight wickets, drew with Peshawar, beat Sialkot by four wickets, and drew with Lahore Ravi. In their next match they thrashed Karachi Blues by an innings and 140 runs, dismissing them for 51 in the second innings; Nasir Malik took 5 for 108 and 6 for 17.\nProgressing into Super Eight Group B, Rawalpindi drew against Lahore Shalimar, beat Sialkot again, this time by nine wickets, and drew against Multan, finishing at 345 for 9 in pursuit of 430 to win. As they were the only team in their group to win a match, they progressed to the final.\nAt the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, Islamabad won the toss and sent Rawalpindi in, dismissing them early on the second day for 211. A seventh-wicket partnership of 139 between Awais Zia and Zahid Mansoor produced the bulk of Rawalpindi's runs. Rawalpindi then dismissed Islamabad for 175 just before stumps on the second day, Nasir Malik taking four wickets. The opener Shoaib Nasir dominated the Rawalpindi second innings, scoring 177, his highest score in first-class cricket, off 296 balls. He and Babar Naeem added 159 for the fourth wicket off 39 overs. When Rawalpindi were all out for 398, Islamabad needed 435 to win in just under a day and a half, but they lost a wicket in the first over and continued to lose wickets regularly until they were all out for 206, giving Rawalpindi victory by 228 runs. Akhtar Ayub took 5 for 67, giving him eight wickets for the match. Shoaib Nasir won the player of the match award.\nRawalpindi's first-class playing record, excluding the divided teams above, was 355 matches, 126 wins, 103 losses and 126 draws. Rawalpindi's List A and Twenty20 sides were known as the Rawalpindi Rams.\nRefounding.\nIn 2023, the Rawalpindi cricket team was refounded as part of the restructuring of the Pakistani domestic system.\nPlayers with international caps are listed in bold.

Al Unser was the national champion, and the rookie of the year was Teo Fabi. The 1983 Indianapolis 500 was sanctioned by USAC, but an arrangement was made such that it counted towards the CART points championship. Tom Sneva won the Indy 500, after three previous runner-up finishes.\nAl Unser jumped out to the early points lead, with second-place finishes in the first three races of the season. Unser finished second at Indianapolis to Tom Sneva, but not without some controversy. Rookie Al Unser Jr. was accused of blocking for his father, but Sneva prevailed, making the winning pass with ten laps to go. Unser won at Cleveland, finished second at the Michigan 500, and third at Road America. After 6 of 13 races, Unser had a 35-point lead over Tom Sneva in the standings.\nRookie Teo Fabi made headlines at Indianapolis, becoming the first rookie to win the pole since 1950. His car dropped out, however, with a failed fuel o-ring. After a mixed start to the year, Fabi's season came alive in July, winning his first career race at the Pocono 500. Fabi jumped from 8th in points to as high as second following his win at Mid-Ohio. Fabi began to whittle away at Unser's point lead. Unser was running consistently, and had no finish worse than 11th.\nIn the next-to-last race of the season at Laguna Seca, Fabi dominated. He won the pole position and led 95 of 98 laps, winning his third race of the season. With only one race to go, Unser's point lead was down to 15 points. At the season finale in Phoenix, Fabi put in another dominating performance. He won the pole and led 138 of 150 laps. Fabi's championship hopes, however, fell just short as Al Unser came home 4th. Al Unser won the title by a mere 5 points over Fabi.\nOther top stories from 1983 included Newman/Haas Racing joining the series with driver Mario Andretti plus a new chassis from Lola, and the rookie debut of Al Unser Jr. Though Unser Jr. did not win any races, he had ten top-10 finishes en route to 7th in points.\nDrivers and constructors.\nThe following teams and drivers competed for the 1983 CART World Series.

        "text": "The 1985 CART PPG Indy Car World Series season was the 7th national championship season of American open wheel racing sanctioned by CART. The season consisted of 15 races. Al Unser Sr. was the national champion, and the rookie of the year was Arie Luyendyk. The 1985 Indianapolis 500 was sanctioned by USAC, but counted towards the CART points championship. Danny Sullivan won the Indy 500, in dramatic fashion, a race that became known as the \"Spin and Win.\"\nIn September 1984, Rick Mears suffered serious leg injuries in a crash at Sanair. Mears drove only a part-time schedule in 1985, racing at Indianapolis, and subsequently on ovals only. Al Unser Sr. took Mears' full-time seat at Penske Racing as a substitute for the season. Unser had one win, ten top fives, and one other top ten, en route to the championship, a battle that climaxed in dramatic fashion in the final race of the season.\nSeason summary.\nDefending series champion Mario Andretti won the season opener, finished second at the Indy 500, and won the next two races, jumping out to the early points lead. A mid-season slump, however, saw him achieve only one top five finish the remainder of the year. He then broke his collarbone in a crash at Michigan, and was forced to sit out one race. The driver of the season became Al Unser Jr., who won the next two races (Meadowlands and Cleveland), and finished the year with nine finishes in the top 4.\nAt the midpoint of the season, Mario Andretti's points lead had dwindled, while Emerson Fittipaldi, Al Unser Sr., and Al Unser Jr. were all closing in. At the Pocono 500, Rick Mears triumphantly returned to victory lane after his leg injuries. Finishing second and third were Al Jr. and Al Sr., respectively, with Al Sr. now taking the points lead. Unser Jr. ate away at the points lead over the next four races, and the Unsers were neck-and-neck approaching the season finale. Meanwhile, Bobby Rahal was making a championship run of his own, winning 3 out of 4 races, and four poles in a row during a stretch in September-October. He almost won four races in row, but was taken out while leading at Sanair with only 13 laps to go. Rahal closed to within 13 points of the championship lead.\nWith two races to go, Unser Jr. led Unser Sr. by only 3 points. Father and son finished 1st and 2nd at Phoenix, and the standings were flipped. Al Sr. led Al Jr. by 3 points going into the finale at Miami. Rahal finished a distant 6th at Phoenix, and was mathematically eliminated from the championship.\nThe season finale at Tamiami Park ended in dramatic fashion. Danny Sullivan and Bobby Rahal finished 1st and 2nd, respectively, but the attention of the day was focused on the two Unsers. Late in the race, Al Unser Jr. was running third, and Al Unser Sr. was running 5th. At the moment, Al Jr. was leading the hypothetical championship standings by 1 point.\nIn the closing laps, Al Unser Sr. chased down and passed Roberto Moreno for 4th place. He held on to finish fourth, and thus won the championship by 1 point over his son. Unser Sr. afterwards expressed some regret about snatching the championship title from his son, but felt it was his responsibility to his own team and his own sponsors to race to his ability all the way to the end. It was also in the best interests of sportsmanship to all competitors not to give favor to his son. Unser Sr. also knew his days were numbered as a competitive driver on the circuit, while he knew Unser Jr. had many years ahead to have another chance at the title (Al Unser Jr. would indeed win the championship twice - 1990 and 1994).\nThe 1985 season saw two controversies at two separate races. The Michigan 500 had to be postponed for a week due to tire issues. In September, the race at Sanair came to a bizarre conclusion when the safety car, leading the field on the final lap under caution, suddenly veered into the pits on the final turn. Leader Johnny Rutherford was not informed, and second place Pancho Carter accelerated past him and beat him to the finish line. Officials initially awarded the victory to Carter, and Rutherford protested. After review, Rutherford was eventually restored the victory. (In many motorsport codes, the safety car exits to pit lane on the final lap; in most North American codes, the safety car remains on the circuit towards the finish line.)\nDrivers and teams.\nThe following teams and drivers competed in the 1985 Indy Car World Series season. All cars used Goodyear tires.\nSeason Schedule and Results.\nSchedule.\n Oval/Speedway&lt;br&gt;\n Road/Street course&lt;br&gt;\nNC Non-championship event\nThe Dana 150 was scheduled for March 31, but postponed on March 13 due to track damage sustained over winter testing. On August 6, it was rescheduled for an October 13 date.\nThe Michigan 500 was scheduled for July 21, but postponed a week due to tire concerns. NBC did not return to televise the race.\nSanair controversy.\nIn the Sanair race (Molson Indy 300), Roberto Guerrero had a strong lead until he lost control and spun. Later in the race Jacques Villeneuve Sr. collided with leader Bobby Rahal in attempt to challenge for the lead, taking both out. The race finished under a yellow flag, but the safety car entered pit lane on the final lap, and thinking there would be a final restart, Pancho Carter passed Johnny Rutherford after the safety car entered pit lane and before the finish line. CART initially declared Carter the winner, but an appeals panel later overturned the decision and confirmed Rutherford's victory. In many codes of motorsport (typically FIA Code) the safety car enters pit lane as the field is on the final lap, and the cars cross the checkered flag together without the safety car on course. However, this practice is not accepted in North America, where the safety car leads the leaders to the finish line if the safety car situation exists."

The season consisted of 17 races, and one non-points exhibition event. Bobby Rahal was the national champion, and the rookie of the year was Chip Robinson. The 1986 Indianapolis 500 was sanctioned by USAC, but counted towards the CART points championship. Bobby Rahal won the Indy 500, and would later become the first driver since 1980 to win Indy and the CART championship in the same season.\nThe first two races of the season were won by Kevin Cogan (Phoenix) and Michael Andretti (Long Beach), respectively, the first career wins for both drivers on the CART circuit. Rain delayed the Indianapolis 500, postponing it for six days. Bobby Rahal, driving for Truesports, passed Kevin Cogan with two laps to go, and won for car owner Jim Trueman, who was stricken with cancer. Trueman died less than two weeks later.\nThe season would shape up as a two-man battle between Rahal and Michael Andretti. Andretti won at Milwaukee, which put him in the points lead for the first time. On Father's Day, Andretti was leading on the final lap at Portland. His car ran out of fuel on the final turn of the final lap, and his father Mario beat him to the finish line by 0.07 seconds. It would go down in lore as one of the most shocking finishes in Indy car history, as well as the closest finish in Indy car history on a road course (until 1997).\nRahal was back in victory lane in July, winning the inaugural Molson Indy Toronto, but Michael Andretti still held the points lead. Rahal won four out of five races during a stretch in August and September, and emerged with a 9-point lead in the standings with two races left. Michael Andretti won a key victory at the second-to-last race of the season at Phoenix, while Rahal finished 3rd.\nGoing into the season finale at Tamiami Park, Rahal held a scant 3-point lead over Andretti. Neither driver was a factor at Miami, and just past the halfway point, Andretti dropped out with a broken halfshaft. Rahal effectively clinched the championship when Andretti dropped out. Roberto Guerrero won the pole and dominated the race, leading the first 111 laps. But on the final lap, his car sputtered and he ran out of fuel.

The season consisted of 16 races, and one non-points exhibition event. Bobby Rahal was the national champion, winning his second-consecutive title. The rookie of the year was Fabrizio Barbazza. The 1987 Indianapolis 500 was sanctioned by USAC, but counted towards the CART points championship. Al Unser won the Indy 500, his record-tying fourth victory at Indy.\nDefending series champion and defending Indy 500 winner Bobby Rahal and his Truesports team made a highly publicized switch from the March chassis to the up-and-coming Lola chassis. Truesports, however, stayed with the proven Cosworth engine. For 1987, the Ilmor Chevrolet Indy V-8 expanded its participation, fielding cars with Penske Racing, Newman/Haas and Patrick. Mario Andretti scored the engine's first Indy car victory in the season opener at Long Beach. Also joining the series full-time was the Judd AV V-8 (badged initially as the Brabham-Honda), and later in the season Porsche made their Indy car debut. Penske resumed their in-house chassis program, but after dismal results with the PC-16, the cars were parked during practice at Indy in favor of the March 86C.\nRoberto Guerrero won the second race of the season (Phoenix), starting from last position on the grid due to failing post qualifying inspection. Mario Andretti dominated the Indianapolis 500, leading 171 of the first 177 laps, but dropped out with engine failure with only 23 laps to go. Guerrero took the lead, but stalled during his final pit stop. Al Unser led the final 18 laps to win, one of the biggest upsets in Indy 500 history. Though Guerrero faltered at Indy, he would be a factor through most of the season. After winning at Mid-Ohio in September he was third in points. However he was sidelined with serious head injuries due to a testing crash at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and was in a coma for seventeen days, missing the remainder of the season. \nFor the second year in a row, the championship battle came down to Bobby Rahal and Michael Andretti. Rahal took the points lead after back-to-back wins at Portland and the Meadowlands. Andretti won the Michigan 500, and drew within 9 points of Rahal. At Mid-Ohio, Rahal was dominating until he tangled with a backmarker. Andretti had a chance to make up ground in the points, but blew his engine two laps later.\nMichael Andretti rebounded, winning in dominating fashion at the inaugural race at Nazareth. But Rahal charged to finish second, and with two races left, held a 25-point lead. In the next-to-last race of the season at Laguna Seca, Andretti dropped out with alternator trouble, and Rahal mathematically clinched the championship. It was Rahal's second-consecutive CART title, and Michael Andretti finished runner-up in points for the second year in a row.\nTeams and drivers.\nThe following teams and drivers competed in the 1987 Indy Car World Series season. All cars used Goodyear tires.\n(R) – Rookie\nSeason Summary.\nSchedule.\nThere would only be one race at Phoenix International Raceway and Michigan International Speedway from this season forward. Additionally Pennsylvania International Raceway had been paved and added to the schedule as a 200 mile event for the first time.\n- Miami was supposed to run for 200 miles (322 kilometers) but was shortened due to rain.\n Oval/Speedway&lt;br&gt;\n Road/Street course&lt;br&gt;\n Non-championship event&lt;br&gt;\nRace summaries.\nLong Beach.\nMario Andretti started on the pole position and dominated the Long Beach Grand Prix, his third win in four years at the circuit. It marked the first-ever victory in Indy car competition for the Ilmor Chevrolet Indy V-8 engine. Emerson Fittipaldi was a close second until he dropped out with turbocharger failure.\nPhoenix.\nRoberto Guerrero qualified third, but failed post-qualifying inspection for being 2.5 pounds underweight. He was forced to start last on the grid. Guerrero quickly charged through the field, and was in the top five by lap 46. He dueled with Bobby Rahal for the lead on lap 62, and dominated the second half. Even a stop-and-go penalty for hitting a tire in the pits did not slow Guerrero's run.\nGuerrero won by 8 seconds over Rahal, becoming only the fourth driver in modern Indy car history to win a race from the last starting position.\nIndianapolis 500.\nMario Andretti dominated the entire month of May at Indy. He ran the fastest practice laps, won the pole position, the pit stop contest, and led 170 of the first 177 laps. With only 23 laps to go, Andretti suddenly slowed with a broken valve spring which led to fueling and engine failure. Roberto Guerrero, the winner at Phoenix, stalled in the pits while leading due to a failing clutch, and came home second while Al Unser, who had entered the month without a ride took the lead with 18 laps to go, and recorded one of the biggest upsets in Indy history.\nMilwaukee.\nWhile leading the race on lap 149, Mario Andretti broke a rear wing, sending the car hard into the outside and inside walls. He was taken to the hospital with relatively minor injuries. Mario's son Michael Andretti took the lead after the accident, locked in a duel with Roberto Guerrero.\nOn lap 177, Guerrero suddenly blew his engine, leaving Michael Andretti in the lead. A late-race caution allowed Bobby Rahal to close the gap, but Michael held on for the victory. Rahal finished second.\nPortland.\nBobby Rahal won his first race of the season, passing Michael Andretti for the lead on lap 70 of 104. Rahal built up a 22-second lead late in the race, but slowed to conserve fuel over the final 10 laps. Andretti closed to within 6 seconds, but managed only second place.\nMeadowlands.\nBobby Rahal made it back-to-back victories, winning for the second time of the season at the Meadowlands. Rahal also took over the points lead.\nCleveland.\nEmerson Fittipaldi and Bobby Rahal pitted for the final time on lap 53, both hoping to stretch their fuel to the finish. Fittipaldi pulled out to an 18-second lead, and despite the fuel light flashing over the final five laps, held on to win his first race of the season.\nRahal finished a strong second, and increased his lead in the points standings.\nToronto.\nEmerson Fittipaldi looked to win his second race in a row, but a final lap mishap almost cost him the race. With Danny Sullivan running second on the final lap, Fittipaldi led by about 4 seconds at the white flag. Down the Lake Shore Drive backstretch on the final lap, however, Fittipaldi became mired in traffic. Through the hairpin, the track was essentially blocked by three backmarkers, which allowed Sullivan to dramatically close the gap. With two turns to go, Sullivan dove below Fittipaldi for the lead, but the two cars touched wheels. Fittipaldi's car stayed straight, but Sullivan spun out.\nFittipaldi went on to win, while Sullivan limped across the finish line to hold on to second. Bobby Rahal came home third and padded his championship lead.\nMichigan 500.\nJust as at Indianapolis, Mario Andretti dominated the race. Taking the lead on lap 43, he led the next 114 laps and had a 1 lap lead on his son Michael, in second place, and a 2 lap lead on the rest of the field. But, just as at Indianapolis, his engine blew on lap 156, ending his day.\nWith 8 laps to go, Michael Andretti led Indy 500 winner Al Unser and Bobby Rahal. Andretti needed to make his final pit stop, but a faulty clutch nearly cost him dearly. Andretti's car sputtered and nearly stalled as he pulled away, and he lost several seconds.\nBack on the track, Michael maintained a 9-second lead to the finish, with Unser finishing second. Third place Rahal maintained a 9-point advantage over Michael in the points championship.\nPocono 500.\nMario Andretti started from the pole and led 22 laps, but gets too low in turn one on lap 89, and crashed hard into the outside wall. He suffers a separated shoulder, his second injury of the season. The rough apron of turn one was stained by lime, which caused Andretti's car to lose traction.\nRick Mears, who had not won a race in two years, led Geoff Brabham late in the race, but was low on fuel. Mears' car sputtered on the final lap, but he crossed the line under power to take the victory. It was the first 500-mile race victory for the Ilmor Chevy Indy V-8 engine. Brabham, meanwhile, scored a career-best second place, and the best finish yet for the new Brabham-Honda engine. Roberto Guerrero, who led with 17 laps to go, dropped to third when he was forced to pit for fuel five laps from the end.\nPoints leader Bobby Rahal came home 5th, and maintained a championship lead of 14 points over Michael Andretti.\nRoad America.\nAfter four months of disappointments and injuries, Mario Andretti finally found the winner's circle for the first time since the season opener. Despite recovering from a separated shoulder, Andretti won the pole and dominated the race wire-to-wire, leading all 50 laps. Geoff Brabham scored his second runner-up finish in a row.\nThe top two drivers in the points standings, Bobby Rahal and Michael Andretti, both finished out of the points.\nMid-Ohio.\nBobby Rahal was leading by half a lap and looking for his third consecutive victory at Mid-Ohio. With about 12 laps to go, however, Rahal tangled with the lapped car of Rick Miaskiewicz, forcing him to pit with a punctured tire.\nRoberto Guerrero blew by the limping car of Rahal to take the lead on lap 74, and Michael Andretti swept into second. Andretti had a golden opportunity to make up ground in the championship hunt, but a few laps later, blew his engine. Rahal climbed back up to second, while Guerrero won his second race of the season.\nFour days later, Guerrero would be injured during a tire test at Indianapolis. He was struck in the head by a tire, leaving him in a coma, and sidelined for the remainder of the season.\nNazareth.\nCART made its debut at the newly reconstructed Pennsylvania International Raceway in Nazareth. Hometown driver Michael Andretti led 150 laps, looking to make up as much ground as possible in the championship hunt against Bobby Rahal.\nAl Unser drove substitution for the injured Roberto Guerrero, charging to as high as second place late in the race. With seven laps to go, Unser touched wheels with Jeff MacPherson, and smacked the outside wall coming out of turn 4. Rahal, who had lost a lap after nearly stalling in the pits, moved up to second at the checkered flag. With two races remaining, Rahal held a 25-point lead.\nLaguna Seca.\nWith the championship down to two drivers, Bobby Rahal and Michael Andretti, Rahal needed to finish the final two races to hold on to his second-consecutive CART title. Rahal had won the Laguna Seca event three years in a row, going for four.\nWhen Michael Andretti dropped out on lap 36 with alternator trouble, Rahal clinched the championship title, regardless of his finish at the final race in Miami. Later in the race, Mario Andretti dropped out, enabling Rahal to take the lead and win at Laguna Seca for a record fourth year in a row. Rahal celebrated in victory lane both the race win and the CART championship title.\nAlso making news at Laguna Seca was the debut of the Porsche Indy car team led by Al Holbert. A week after substituting for Roberto Guerrero, Al Unser was back on the track in another car, this time behind the wheel of the new Porsche. The effort started out on a sour note, however. The car was slow and dropped out after only seven laps with a broken water pump. It would be Unser's lone race with the team, and the only event the chassis would race. The following year the Porsche team would switch to March chassis.\nTamiami Park.\nWith the championship title already decided, Michael Andretti dominated en route to victory, but still finished second in the points standings.\nRahal, who had won the exhibition Marlboro Challenge a day earlier, finished 7th."

        "text": "The 1988 CART PPG Indy Car World Series season was the 10th national championship season of American open wheel racing sanctioned by CART. The season consisted of 15 races, and one non-points exhibition event. Danny Sullivan was the national champion, winning for Team Penske. The rookie of the year was John Jones. The 1988 Indianapolis 500 was sanctioned by USAC, but counted towards the CART points championship. Rick Mears won the Indy 500, his third victory at Indy.\nThe 1988 season was the breakout year for the Ilmor Chevrolet Indy V-8 engine. After being introduced in 1986, and earning its first victory in 1987, the Ilmor Chevy dominated the series in 1988, and established itself as the best powerplant on the circuit. Chevy won 14 of the 15 races, and all 15 pole positions. Along the way, the Ilmor Chevy earned its first victory at Indianapolis in 1988, with Rick Mears winning from the pole.\nSeason recap.\nDanny Sullivan won four races, nine pole positions, and had 11 top five finishes en route to the championship title. Sullivan got off to a slow start, but at Indy, he and his Penske teammates (Rick Mears and Al Unser) dominated the month of May. The Penske team swept all three spots on the front row, and led 192 of the 200 laps. Sullivan himself qualified second and dominated the first half of the race. He dropped out just beyond the halfway point when a wing adjuster failed and sent his car into the wall. He rebounded over the next six races, posting two wins and no finish worse than 4th.\nSullivan's nearest competitors during the season were Al Unser Jr. and Bobby Rahal. Unser Jr. left Doug Shierson Racing after a winless 1987 campaign and returned to Galles Racing for 1988, and also got use of the coveted Chevrolet engine. Unser won at Long Beach and Toronto, then won a controversial race at the Meadowlands. Battling for the lead in the late stages of the race, he tangled with Emerson Fittipaldi, sending Fittipaldi into the tire barrier.\nBack-to-back defending CART champion, and 1986 Indy winner Bobby Rahal returned for his last season at Truesports. The team dropped the Cosworth DFX and the took up development of the Judd AV engine. The engine was known to be down on horsepower, but excelled in fuel mileage and reliability, particularly in the 500-mile races. Rahal finished 4th at Indy, second at the Michigan 500, and won the Pocono 500. His ten top five finishes kept him in contention for the title, but with only one win, he was struggling to keep pace with the Chevy-powered teams.\nAfter winning the Michigan 500, Danny Sullivan took the points lead for the first time all year. The lead was short-lived, however, as he wrecked at Pocono. Rahal and Unser Jr. finished 1-2 at Pocono, and the top three in the standings were separated by only 5 points with five races remaining.\nAt Mid-Ohio, Rahal crashed out, and his title hopes began to fade. Sullivan and Unser were separated by 1 point with four races to go. All three drivers finished strong at Road America, and the championship battle pushed on. The turning point of the season came at Nazareth. Al Unser Jr. blew his engine, Rahal was not a factor, but Sullivan dominated. Sullivan started from the pole, and led the final 74 laps to score a crucial victory. With only two races left, Sullivan had a commanding 25-point lead. At the second-to-last race of the season at Laguna Seca, Sullivan pulled out a hat trick by winning the pole, leading the most laps, and winning the race. With still one race left, Sullivan clinched the 1988 CART title, holding an insurmountable 35-point lead. It was Sullivan's first and only championship title and Penske's first since 1985.\nWith the championship decided for Sullivan, the season finale at Miami became a race to see who would finish second in points. Rahal held an 8-point lead over Al Unser Jr., with Mario Andretti and Rick Mears also lurking in 4th and 5th, respectively. Unser Jr. dominated the race, leading 82 (of 112) laps and winning for the second time at the Tamiami Park circuit. Rahal blew an engine, Mario Andretti dropped out, and Mears finished second. The results saw a shake up in the standings, with Unser Jr. finishing second in points, Rahal third, and Mears slipping ahead of Andretti by 3 points for 4th and 5th.\nOther stories from 1988 included A. J. Foyt returning to a full-time schedule (from 1980-1987, he only ran a partial schedule), and the Porsche Indy car team expanding to full-time with driver Teo Fabi. Rookie John Andretti suffered a devastating crash at the Pocono 500, but would recover before the end of the season. Jim Crawford, who suffered serious leg injuries in a crash in 1987, returned to the cockpit with a notable run at Indianapolis where he led 8 laps and finished 6th, the best result to-date for the Buick V-6 engine.\nAnother story was the continued downward spiral of March. After Portland the Patrick Racing Team changed from the latest March to a Lola fleet which consisted of the current model and a year old Lola.\nDrivers and constructors.\nThe following teams and drivers competed for the 1988 Indy Car World Series.\nSeason Summary.\nSchedule.\n Oval/Speedway&lt;br&gt;\n Road/Street course&lt;br&gt;\n Non-championship event&lt;br&gt;"

The season consisted of 15 races, and one non-points exhibition event. Emerson Fittipaldi was the national champion, and the rookie of the year was Bernard Jourdain. Fittipaldi became the second driver after Mario Andretti to win the Formula One World Championship and the CART championship.\nThe 1989 Indianapolis 500 was sanctioned by USAC, but counted towards the CART points championship. Emerson Fittipaldi won the Indy 500, and would later become the first driver since Bobby Rahal in 1986 to win Indy and the CART championship in the same season.\nEmerson Fittipaldi won a total of five races, four pole positions, and had a total of eight podium finishes en route to the championship. Rick Mears won three races, and had a total of 14 top ten finishes, more consistent than Fittipaldi. The championship battle came down to those two drivers. In the second-to-last race of the season at Nazareth, Fittipaldi and Mears finished 1st-2nd. Fittipaldi effectively clinched the championship by virtue of a now 22-point lead over Mears. If Mears were to win the season finale at Laguna Seca, win the pole, and lead the most laps, he could tie Fittipaldi in points if Fittipaldi finished 13th or worse. However, Fittipaldi held the tiebreaker with 5 wins versus Mears with 3. Mears did all three at Laguna Seca (won the pole, won the race and led the most laps), but the tiebreaker scenario was moot as Fittipaldi managed a 5th place in the race. It was Mears' first road course victory since Riverside in 1982, and the first since he suffered serious leg injuries in 1984. It was also the last road course win of his career.\nAt Mid-Ohio, Teo Fabi scored the first and only win of the Porsche Indy Car team. Fabi had eleven top tens, and finished 4th in points. Cosworth unveiled a new engine, the \"short-stroke\" DFS to some fanfare, but little success. Bobby Rahal won one race in 1989 with the Cosworth DFS in July at the Meadowlands. It would stand as the only race victory for the DFS powerplant.\nDrivers and constructors.\nThe following teams and drivers competed for the 1989 Indy Car World Series.

        "text": "Thomas Clayton (born April 26, 1984) is a former American football running back. He was selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the sixth round of the 2007 NFL Draft. He last played college football at Kansas State.\nHe has also been a member of the Cleveland Browns, New England Patriots, Seattle Seahawks and Arizona Cardinals.\nEarly years.\nClayton was born in Germany on April 26, 1984. Clayton grew up in the Washington DC metropolitan area where he attended Mount Vernon High School in Alexandria, Virginia, where he was a SuperPrep All-American running back. He was named to the USA Today All-USA team and was rated the eighth best running back nationally by Rivals.com and participated in U.S. Army All-American Bowl As a senior, he rushed for more than 2,000 yards.\nCollege career.\nClayton began his college football career at Florida State University as a true freshman in 2002, rushing for 45 yards on 13 attempts. Clayton made his final appearance as a Seminole, playing in the 2003 Sugar Bowl. Following the BCS Bowl, Clayton then transferred to Kansas State University, where he sat out the 2003 season under NCAA transfer rules. In 2004, Clayton appeared in 10 games serving as primary backup to Darren Sproles. He finishing with 14 carries for 71 yards. In 2005, with the departure of Darren Sproles to the NFL, Clayton's junior year looked to be promising. Picking up where Sproles left off, Clayton looked to be Kansas State's new bell cow, shredding opposing defenses for an average of 164.5 yards per game and 7.7 yards per rush. Leading the nation in both rushing yards per game, and yards per carry after week 3, Clayton was off to one of the best starts in school history, piling up 329 yards in the first two games. It was the most rushing yards in school history for the first two games of a season. He needed 221 yards to equal the best three-game start in school history and 70 yards for the second-best start, and against a feeble University of North Texas opponent coming week 4, Clayton would have had no problem accomplishing that had he not been suspended due to an arrest during the team's week 3 bye. \"Thomas Clayton, the nation's leading rusher, was arrested Friday and charged with aggravated battery, stemming from a Sept. 16 altercation involving a university parking services employee.\" Obviously slowed down by this arrest, Clayton found himself in the dog house after such a promising start. Working himself back into good grace with the team, Clayton was able to finish the 2005 season with two strong games against Nebraska (85 yards) and Missouri (104 yards), allowing him to finish as the team's leading rusher with 637 yards and 5 total touchdowns. In 2006, Clayton entered the season ranked amongst the nation's top 10 returning senior running backs. However, with the retirement of head coach Bill Snyder, and the hiring of Ron Prince, Clayton was not able to match his 2005 success. With obvious friction between Clayton and Prince, Clayton only started 4 games his senior year, finishing the year with 338 rushing yards and 3 touchdowns before parting ways with the team after week 6, for undisclosed reasons. Clayton's best game in 2006 came in week 3 against Kansas State's highest ranked opponent, #5 Louisville Cardinals, where he rushed for 119 yards on 15 carries, one of which went 69 yards for a touchdown. He also hauled in five passes for 34 yards.\nThough Clayton only participated in 4 games his senior season, NFL scouts felt he displayed plenty of upside in his junior season to receive a 2007 NFL Combine invitation. Clayton also participated in the 2007 Senior Bowl. Clayton was a late addition to the 2007 Senior Bowl roster, but certainly made his presence felt upon his arrival to Mobile, Alabama. Clayton took advantage of his opportunity to display his ability in Mobile, immediately catching the eye of NFL scouts with his burst and quickness throughout the week of practice.\nProfessional career.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nClayton was selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the sixth round (186th overall) of the 2007 NFL Draft. He went on to lead the NFL in rushing during the 2007 preseason. He duplicated his preseason success in 2008, where he led all rushers again. In August 2009, Clayton suffered an ACL injury, and was placed on injured reserve, where he spent the entire season.\nFirst stint with the Patriots.\nClayton signed with the New England Patriots on June 11, 2010. He was waived on August 6, 2010, but re-signed on August 11, 2010. He was waived during final cuts on September 4, 2010.\nFirst stint with the Browns.\nClayton was signed to the Cleveland Browns' practice squad on September 14, 2010.\nSecond stint with the Patriots.\nThe Patriots signed Clayton off the Browns' practice squad on September 30, 2010. He was waived on October 23, 2010.\nSecond stint with the Browns.\nClayton was claimed off waivers by the Browns on October 25, 2010. He was waived on December 1, 2010. He was active for two games, registering 0 yards on one carry in a Week 10 loss to the New York Jets.\nThird stint with the Patriots.\nThe Patriots claimed Clayton off waivers on December 2, 2010. He played in one game for the Patriots, the Week 17 season finale against the Miami Dolphins, running six times for 17 yards. He was released on August 3, 2011.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nClayton was claimed off waivers by the Seattle Seahawks on August 3 and then released prior to the start of the season.\nThird stint with the Browns.\nClayton signed with the Browns on November 1, 2011, after Montario Hardesty tore his calf muscle.\nArizona Cardinals.\nClayton signed with the Arizona Cardinals on July 31, 2012. He was waived/injured on August 24, 2012."

        "title": "History of the France national rugby union team",
        "text": "The French national rugby union team first competed at the 1900 Summer Olympics.\nEarly years.\nRugby was introduced to the Le Havre region of France by British merchants and students in the 1870s and was subsequently spread throughout the schools and colleges. The first clubs were established in the late 1870s and early 1880s, with a club championship soon formed, and games against English clubs organised. The first involvement a national rugby union side had was at the 1900 Paris Olympics, where a French team took part in the tournament and defeated Britain (represented by Mosley Wanderers RFC) 27 – 8 and Germany 27–17 to win the gold medal. However the team represent France at the 1900 games are not considered to be a Test XV.\nOn January 1, 1906 France played its first ever Test match – a 38–8 loss to Dave Gallaher's All Blacks in Paris. In \"The Complete Rugby Footballer\", Gallaher and Billy Stead wrote of French rugby; \"We are strongly of the opinion that the game will spread in their country and that in the course of time they will put a team in the field which will command the utmost respect of any other.\" France first played England in March of that year, again in France, this time losing 35–8.\nFrance played their first Test outside their nation on the January 1, 1907, losing to England 31–13 at the Athletic Ground in Richmond. Two days later they played a game against the Springboks in Parc des Princes, Paris with a side made up from the two Parisian clubs: Stade Français and Racing Club de France. Only two of the side that had faced the All Blacks played against the Springboks – three-quarter Paul Sagot and forward Georges Jérôme – and none was in the team that had played England. The Springboks scored 13 tries in winning 55–6.\nThe Five Nations and the Olympics.\nFrance played Wales for the first time on 2 March 1908, losing 36 – 14 away from home. On March 20, 1909, France played Ireland for the first time, falling 19–8.\nWhen Scotland played France in the first official international match between the two countries in 1910, the foundation was laid for a Five Nations competition. Their first win in the competition came against Scotland 16–15 in Paris in 1911. In early 1913, France was host to a touring Springboks party, France lost 5 points to 35, the match was part of an era that last from 1911 until 1920 which saw France lose 18 games in a row.\nIn 1919, the Fédération Française de Rugby was formed, 13 years after France's Test debut. At the 1920 Antwerp Olympics there was another rugby event and France was one of only two teams to enter. A straight final took place between the US and France but the US caused a shock by winning 8–0 to take the gold medal. Their first win in the five nations against Ireland was attained in 1920 in Dublin – 15–7. During their last match of the 1921 Five Nations, France showed signs of new strength beating Ireland 20 to 10. Though France did not win a game the following year, the side did draw with Scotland and England.\nFor the 1924 Olympics held in Paris rugby union was again included. France scored 13 tries to comfortably defeated Romania 59–3, with winger Adolphe Jaureguy scoring four. The final took place at Colombes Stadium in Paris on May 18, 1924 and the US took the gold with a 17–3 victory in front of 30,000 spectators. The All Blacks returned to France in 1925, the first time since their inaugural Test against them in 1906, France lost 6 to 30.\nExpelled from Five Nations.\nThe mid to late 1920s was a period of disappointment for the French, that is until they won their first games over England and Wales, in 1927 and 1928 respectively. France had mediocre results on field during the latter end of the decade and the start of the 1930s, but showed definite signs of improvements in the Five Nations. However, they were expelled from the Five Nations in 1932 following accusations of professionalism in the French league as well as on-field violence and poor organisation and were not allowed to rejoin until 1939. During this time many French players turned to rugby league, which began to build in popularity, as the latter code was excluded from the Five Nations. Despite this there were some internationals played; Germany between 1932 and 1936, Italy (1937) and Romania (1938). On 2 January 1934 FIRA was formed, an organisation to rival the International Rugby Board (IRB). Having been expelled from the Five Nations and forced to play against weaker opposition, France went on a winning spree which still stands today, winning ten games in a row during the years from 1931 to 1936. In 1939, the FFR was invited to send a team to the Five Nations Championship for the following season, but when war was declared, international rugby was suspended. While occupied by Germany during the Second World War, Vichy France banned rugby league and forced its integration into French rugby union.\nPost war.\nThe Five nations resumed after the second World War in 1947 and French rugby came of age. Lucien Mias was the innovative captain whose line-out ploys brought a new attacking dimension to forward play. France beat Wales in 1948 and England in 1951. In 1952, France played their second match against the Springboks and again lost 25–3. France claimed a share of the Five Nations title for the first time in 1954 alongside England and Wales. France also recorded their first win over New Zealand 3–0 at Stade Colombes in 1954. In 1955, France had defeated England, Ireland and Scotland, a win against Wales would give France its first ever Grand Slam. However France lost to Wales 11–16 at Stade Colombes in Paris.\nThe French became the first northern hemisphere country to tour South Africa in 1958. They upset the Springboks by winning the two-Test series. Led by Lucien Mias, in the absence of tour skipper Michel Celaya who had been injured, the underestimated French drew the first Test 3–3 at Newlands and then produced an even bigger shock by beating the Springboks 9–5 at altitude at Ellis Park. That series victory signalled that France were now a top rugby nation. Victories over Scotland and Wales at the Stade Colombes, together with a 3–3 draw with England at Twickenham earned France their first outright Five Nations title in 1959. They arrived in Dublin as champions, only to be denied a Grand Slam by a 9–5 defeat.\nThe sixties.\nLes Bleus scored four tries to one at Cardiff Arms Park and beating Ireland with a record score, 23–6. France's match against England ended in a stalemate and the two sides had to share the 1960 Five Nations trophy. Pierre Albaladejo set a record for the most drop goals, three, in the 23–6 victory over Ireland. France then embarked on a tour of Argentina. In three Tests, France scored 78 points in three victories while the Pumas scored only 12 points. In 1961, the French won the five nations championship outright. The Springboks formidable 1960/61 touring side defeated Scotland, Ireland, England and Wales but were held to a 0–0 draw at Stade Colombes. The game was almost abandoned after fighting broke out. The Tricolours became the first European national team to tour New Zealand in 1961. Les Bleus went on to lose half of the provincial games and both Tests to New Zealand 5–3 and 32–3. The French played a single Test on Australian soil and went home with a 15–8 win over the Wallabies.\nFrance won the 1962 Five Nations, but missed out on the Grand Slam again after losing to Wales for the fourth consecutive year. France lost a Test to Romania at the end of the year and in 1964 again toured South Africa. They lost only one of their six games and defeated South Africa 8–6. According to Danie Craven the Test was the worst seen in South Africa up until that time.\nFrance set a then record win over England in 1966. After back-to-back Welsh wins, the French won the 1967 Five nations title. The title came down to the last match of the championship against Ireland at Lansdowne Road which France won 11–6, only a 9–8 defeat by Scotland preventing them from winning a Grand Slam. France embarked on their first full-scale tour of South Africa. They were beaten 26–3 in Durban and 16–3 in the \"Battle of Bloemfontein\" but were able to come back and win the third 19–14 in Johannesburg and draw the last 6–6 in Cape Town.\nIn 1967, they again won the five nations championship. They returned to South Africa, but lost the Test series 2–1 with one match draw. Fifty-eight years after contesting their first Five Nations tournament, France won their first 'Grand Chelem' with a 14–9 win over Wales at the Arms Park in 1968. However, it was overshadowed by the deaths of Guy Boniface and Jean-Michael Capendeguy in road accidents. They toured New Zealand but once again failed to make an impact, losing the series 3–0. France imploded the following year, losing their first three matches to Scotland, Ireland and England but draw with Wales to deny them a Grand Slam.\nThe seventies.\nLes Bleus continued to feature as a major player in the five nations, finishing first equal in 1970, second in 1971. In 1972, in the final international played at the Yves du Manoir Stadium at Colombes, France marked the occasion by scoring six tries to one and racking up their biggest ever win against England 37–12. Jean Desclaux coached France between 1973 and 1980. The 1976 Championship went well for France, their only loss came against Wales and they beat England 30–9. 1977 saw France win their second Grand Slam with Jacques Fouroux as captain. No tries were scored against them and they fielded an unchanged team throughout the championship. In November, France beat New Zealand 18–10 in Toulouse but the All Blacks squared the series in Paris by winning 15–3. In the 1978 five nations championship, France met Wales in a Grand Slam decider at the Cardiff Arms Park, the Welsh ran out 16–9 victors. In March 1978, France finally became a full member of the International Rugby Board. France overcame a first Test defeat to beat the All Blacks in New Zealand for the first time 24–19 on Bastille day 14 July 1979 at Eden Park.\nThe eighties and early nineties.\nOn the 8th of November 1980, France play their last international against South Africa in the apartheid era. They were led by Jean-Pierre Rives and lost 15–37 to the Springboks at Newlands in what was termed the \"Summer Test\". Jacques Fouroux became the coach of France shortly before the 1981 Five Nations tournament. In the ten years that he managed the side, France won the Five Nations on six occasions and two Grand Slams (1981 and 1987). France's successes were based around their massive pack, a fact which upset a number of commentators in France who preferred a more technical approach. Famous names from this time included Philippe Sella, Daniel Dubroca and Serge Blanco.\nIn 1981 France clinched the Grand Slam at Twickenham. The 1983 championship came down to the last game played against holders Ireland at Lansdowne Road, Ireland triumphed 22–16. Scotland and France meet in a Grand Slam decider at Murrayfield, the Scots secure the Grand Slam. The 1986 Five Nations title is shared by Scotland and France after both won three games and lost one. An inexperienced team New Zealand team arrived in France in the autumn. The vast majority of New Zealand's top players had taken part in a rebel tour of South Africa in 1986 and had been banned. Despite this the 'Baby Blacks' won 19–7 in Toulouse. France won 16–3 over the All Blacks in the 'Battle of Nantes' in 1986.\nFrance entered the inaugural World Cup as one of the favourites. France beat Australia 30–24 in the semi-final, coming from behind three times to triumph. France were unable to repeat the feat in the final against favourites New Zealand losing 29–9. After an embarrassing 12–6 defeat to Romania on French soil, Fouroux was given the sack. The 1988 Five Nations is shared between France and Wales. France again win the Five Nations in 1989, but are denied the Grand Slam by England, who triumph 11–0.\nWith the ban on playing South Africa lifted, France toured South Africa. Tour captain Jean-Francois Tordo was injured playing against Western Province, and was replaced as captain by Olivier Roumat. France won the Test series following a draw and win over their hosts – the win an 18–17 victory at Ellis Park. The series win was unexpected: they had previously lost to a South Africa B side, lost to provincial side Northern Transvaal, and drawn with Free State province. France were knocked out by England in the quarter-finals in the 1991 Rugby World Cup.\nThe early 1990s had seen France in the shadow of England. Eight consecutive defeats to Will Carling's teams, starting in 1989, underlined the indiscipline of French rugby. An isolated Five Nations title came in 1993, as England slipped to defeats in Cardiff and Dublin. In 1992, Argentina stunned France 24–20 in Nantes, the Pumas' first ever win on French soil. On their 1994 tour of New Zealand, the French, under captain Philippe Saint-André, recorded a 2–0 series win over the All Blacks. The series win was sealed by the famous \"try from the end of the world\", which saw Saint-André begin a counterattack from deep in France's end in the final minutes that ended with Jean-Luc Sadourny scoring the winning try. France were desperately unlucky to lose in the semi-finals to the hosts and eventual champions South Africa in 1995. The miserable run against the English finally came to an end in the third place play-off at the 1995 World Cup.\nProfessional era.\nAs the game adjusted to the new professional era, the Championship was very much dominated by England, who coming off the 1995 win, backed up with a tournament win in 1996. During the tournament, France actually defeated England, but it was their one-point loss to Wales that prevented them from taking the title. After the Five Nations France hosted Romania, and later travelled to Argentina for a two match series; winning all fixtures. At the end of the year, they met Wales, who had beaten them in their last game of the Five Nations, though this time France won, 40 to 33, though this was followed by two losses to the Springboks at home.\nAfter narrowly missing out on the 1996 Five Nations championship, France entered the tournament with confidence, and went through the competition undefeated. After the win, France played aspiring Five Nations entrants Italy, who defeated France 40 points to 32. After defeating Romania, France continued on to Australia for a two Test series, which they lost. At the end of the year, France defeated Italy, Romania and Argentina at home, and against host South Africa for a two Test series, losing both, the second by 40 points.\nDespite performing poorly against the southern hemisphere teams of Australia and South Africa in 1997, France successfully defended their Five Nations title, and again completed a grand slam of the tournament, even defeating Wales 51 to nil. France also hosted Australia at the end of the year, though the Wallabies won, 32 to 21. Their Five Nations title defense was off to a weak start, after defeating Ireland by just one point. France went on to lose every other match and finished wooden-spoonists in the last ever Five Nations. Bernard Laporte became the first fully professional head coach at the end of 1999.\nAfter mixed results during the mid-year, France stormed through the group stages at the 1999 World Cup to finish atop of their pool. After defeating Argentina 47 to 26 in the quarter-finals, France proceeded to the semi-finals, where they met red hot favourites, the All Blacks. Trailing by 14 point at the beginning of the second half, Fabien Pelous' troops mounted an outstanding display of attacking rugby, scoring 30 consecutive points to triumph 43–31. In the final, they met Australia; fatigue took hold as they were beaten convincingly 35 to 12 at Cardiff's new Millennium Stadium.\n21st century.\nIn 2000, Italy joined the Five Nations, making the tournament the Six Nations. France did not perform to expectations in the revamped tournament, losing to both England and Ireland and finishing second behind England. After defeating Romania 67 to 20, France hosted Australia in Paris, who beat them 18 to 13 in a 1999 World Cup final re-match. This was followed by a two Test series against the All Blacks, which France lost one and won one.\nFrance again did not perform that well in the 2001 Six Nations, losing to Ireland, Wales and England; and only finishing fifth. They did however manage victories over South Africa and Australia at the end of the year, as well as an impressive 77 to 10 win over Fiji. France went undefeated in the 2002 Six Nations Championship to claim the first Six Nations grand slam. Though they later lost two games to Australia, France defeated South Africa, and drew with the All Blacks that year. France is No. 1 International ranking in 2002.\nFrance lost two matches at the 2003 Six Nations, including their opening game with England, who would go on to win a grand slam. France finished only third. After the strong showing at the World Cup, France reproduced their Six Nations success of 2002 at the 2004 Six Nations Championship. France won all five of their matches to win the tournament and complete a grandslam. France finished second, behind Wales in the 2005 Six Nations Championship, and the following year at the 2006 tournament, France won again, getting their third Six Nations trophy under Laporte.\nIn preparation for the 2003 World Cup, France played Argentina, the All Blacks and England, with mixed results. France won their opening match against Fiji at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium, which saw them continue undefeated through the rest of the pool stages. They met Ireland at Telstra Dome in Melbourne in the quarter-finals, which they won 43 points to 21. France then met England at Telstra Stadium in Sydney, and went down seven to 24. At the same venue, France contested for third place with the All Blacks, and lost, finishing fourth overall in the tournament.\nThe following year France completed a tournament grand slam of the 2004 Six Nations, including a win over World Champions England. After a short successful tour of North America, France played southern hemisphere teams, Australia, Argentina and the All Blacks; losing all three. In 2005 France completed another strong Six Nations, losing only to eventual grand slam winners Wales. France lost a two Test series to South Africa, and lost to Australia during the mid-year. At the end of the year, France continued Australia's run of losses, and completed heavy wins over Canada and Tonga, and a close victory over South Africa. France lost their opening game of the 2006 Six Nations, 16 to 20 to Scotland, but went on to defeat the other four nations to win the Six Nations.\nIn their final tournament before the 2007 World Cup, France's defence of their title proved again successful, although it came down to the final minutes of their last 6 Nations game to regain the crown. France needed to beat Scotland by more than the Irish beat Italy to ensure that they would be champions again. They were successful, winning the Championship by 4 points.\nFrance failed to retain their crown in 2008, finishing third overall. Despite beating Scotland, Italy and Ireland, France's Grand Slam dreams went up in smoke after a poor, aimless performance against England. France also failed to deny Wales the Grand Slam in the final game losing 29–12.\nFrance won the Grand Slam again in 2010 by beating England 12–10 in Paris in their final match.\nFrance's 2011 Rugby World Cup campaign was marked by turmoil within the camp. Reports before the tournament indicated as many as 25 of the 30-member squad had turned against head coach Marc Lièvremont. In pool play, France had unimpressive wins over Japan and Canada, an expected loss to New Zealand, and a shock loss to Tonga. During this stage, Lièvremont heavily criticized the team in the media, further angering many of his players. Veteran number 8 Imanol Harinordoquy responded publicly, attacking Lièvremont for taking his criticism public instead of keeping it within the team. Despite the losses, they qualified for the knockout stage. At this time, the players rebelled against Lièvremont, with Harinordoquy telling the French rugby publication \"Midi Olympique\" after the tournament, \"We had to free ourselves from his supervision.\" The team responded by defeating England 19–12 in the quarter-final and controversially beating Wales 9–8 in the semi-final after Welsh captain Sam Warburton was sent off. The French proved admirable opponents in the final, losing out to New Zealand 8–7 to finish second for the third time in a Rugby World Cup."

        "text": "Pétur Karl Guðmundsson (born 30 October 1958) is an Icelandic former professional basketball player and coach. Standing 2.18 m (7'2\"), weighing 118 kg (260 lb) and playing the center position, Pétur was the first Icelander and one of the first European players ever to play in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Often described as the greatest Icelandic basketball player of all time, he was named the Icelandic Basketball Player of the 20th century by the Icelandic Basketball Association in 2001 and in 2015, he was inducted in to the National Olympic and Sports Association of Iceland Hall of Fame. Pétur was also a member of the Icelandic national basketball team from 1978 to 1992 but missed several years due to FIBA rules banning professional players from playing for national teams.\nEarly life.\nPétur was born and raised in Reykjavík to an Icelandic father and a Faroese mother. He started practicing handball at the age of 8 with Valur's junior teams but after breaking his right arm in a horse riding accident, which affected his ability to throw the ball with power, he turned to basketball at the behest of former national team player Sigurður Helgason. At the age of 12, he was 185 cm tall. Due to his size and skills, he was selected to the Icelandic junior national teams where he was noticed by Marv Harshman, the head coach of University of Washington. Harshman arranged for Pétur to move to Seattle and join Mercer Island High School at the age of 16.\nPlaying career.\nHigh school career.\nPétur attended Mercer Island High School from 1975 to 1977. He missed several games during his first year due to anemia and pneumonia and played limited minutes in several others but managed to average around 15 points per game. During his senior year, he averaged 20 points and 15 rebounds and was an All-State selection.\nCollege career.\nPétur played college basketball at the University of Washington from 1977 to 1980. His best season came in 1978–1979, when he averaged 10.1 points and 4.8 rebounds. On 8 February 1979, he scored a college career-high 37 points in a win against California. On 22 February 1979, he led the Huskies with 17 points in an upset win against top-ranked UCLA. In 81 career games for Washington, Pétur averaged 6.7 points and 5.3 rebounds per game.\nClub career.\nLeaving college (1980–1981).\nAfter his third college season, Pétur signed with Club Atlético River Plate in Argentina during the summer of 1980. Of his stay there he said \"In Argentina we really had no coaching; the refs were terrible; crowds were small but sometimes violent. They wouldn't even start a game down there unless the military was standing by.\" After the season ended in Argentina in November, Pétur briefly joined KR and played with the team in an unofficial continental tournament in England. Despite heavy interest from KR to sign him for the rest of the Úrvalsdeild karla season, Pétur signed with Valur in end of December 1980. On 5 March 1981, he helped Valur win the Icelandic Cup after scoring a team high 20 points in a 90–84 victory against Njarðvík in the Cup finals. In 7 Úrvalsdeild games for Valur, Pétur averaged 16.7 points per game.\nDrafted to the NBA (1981–1982).\nPétur was selected in the third round of the 1981 NBA draft by the Portland Trail Blazers, for whom he played during the 1981–82 season. On 19 March 1982, he scored a season high 18 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in a victory against the Utah Jazz. In 68 games for the Trail Blazers, he averaged 3.2 points and 2.7 rebounds. He did not make the 12-man roster for the 1982–83 season.\nBack in Iceland (1982–1984).\nIn November 1982, Pétur returned to Iceland and joined Íþróttafélag Reykjavíkur. Prior to his arrival, ÍR was last in the league, having lost all 6 games. With Pétur, the team won 9 of its last 14 games, finishing third in the league, and made it to the Cup finals where it lost to Valur, 75–78. In 14 Úrvalsdeild games, Pétur averaged 28.0 points per game.\nIn August 1983 the Blazers traded his rights to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for a 1984 third-round draft pick. He was waived by the Pistons on 25 October 1983, prior to the start of the season.\nIn January 1984, Pétur returned to ÍR as a player-coach. At the time of his arrival, ÍR was dead last in the Úrvalsdeild with only two victories in its first 11 games. Behind Pétur's stellar play, where he averaged 26.6 points per game, the team won 7 of its remaining 9 games but missed the playoffs on a tie breaker.\nSeason in England (1984–1985).\nIn October 1984, Pétur signed with the Sunderland Maestros for the 1984–85 National Basketball League season.

In his first game, he posted 14 points in 20 minutes in a victory against the San Antonio Spurs. After 10 days he received another 10-day contract and then was signed for the rest of the season. In 8 regular season games, he averaged 7.3 points and 4.8 rebounds.\nIn the summer of 1986, Pétur signed a 2-year contract extension with the Lakers. During the training camp, prior to the season, he suffered a back injury that was later diagnosed as a slipped disc and eventually required surgery.\nWhile recovering, he was traded to the San Antonio Spurs along with Frank Brickowski, two draft picks and an undisclosed amount of money in exchange for Mychal Thompson on 13 February 1987. He appeared in a career high 69 games, including 9 starts, during the 1987–88 season. On 28 November 1987, Pétur scored an NBA career high 21 points against the Atlanta Hawks. After being one of eight Spurs players protected in the 1988 NBA expansion draft, Pétur started the first game of the 1988–89 season, a 122–107 victory against his former team Lakers, where he scored 7 points in 21 minutes. He was again in the starting lineup during the second game of the season but suffered a knee injury in the fourth quarter that required surgery. He returned to the court a month later, but struggled as the knee had not fully healed. The injury eventually forced him to miss the rest of the season.\nDuring the summer of 1989, Pétur joined the Lakers summer league team but suffered an achillies injury on practice before the summer league started. Later tests revealed a partial tear in the achillies tendon. In October 1989, he signed a training camp contract with the Minnesota Timberwolves. He was waived before the seasons start.\nPétur played with the Sioux Falls Skyforce from January to March 1990, where he averaged 5.8 points and 6.0 rebounds per game in 22 appearances.\nReturn to the Úrvalsdeild and last try in the USA (1990–1992).\nIn October 1990, Pétur returned to the Úrvalsdeild karla for the first time in six years and signed with Tindastóll for a reported 2.3 million ISK salary for the season. Tindastóll started the season hot, winning 12 of its first 14 games. In January, Pétur suffered an achillies sprain and missed 7 games, 6 of which ended being losses. Due to Pétur's injury, Tindastóll's play faded in the second half of the season and the team lost 9 of its last 12 games, ending with a 15–11 record and finishing fifth, two victories out of the playoffs. For the season, Pétur averaged 19.5 points and 12.7 rebounds while shooting 69.4% from the field.\nIn August 1991, Pétur signed a training camp contract with the Philadelphia 76ers. He was waived in October 1991, prior to the start of the season. The same month, he signed back with Sioux Falls Skyforce. In 4 games for the Skyforce, Pétur averaged 2.8 points and 2.2 rebounds per game.\nOn 20 November, Pétur left the Skyforce and signed back with Tindastóll. Tindastóll had started the season poorly, with 2 victories in their first 6 games. After losing 3 of their first 4 games with Pétur, the team bounced back with three wins in a row. After a loss against KR on 5 January 1992, Tindastóll went on an 11-win run before losing to Skallagrímur in the last game of the season. The loss, along with a KR win on the same day, meant that Tindastóll missed out on the playoffs again. In 20 games for Tindastóll, Pétur averaged 20.0 points and 13.7 rebounds per game.\nFinal season and retirement (1992–1993).\nAfter contemplating retirement due to a back injury, Pétur signed with freshly promoted Breiðablik in August 1992.

In January 1993, Pétur announced that he intended to join Valur for the rest of the season and end his career where it started. His transfer request was however rejected by the Icelandic Basketball Association as transfers between Icelandic teams between 16 December and 15 February were only allowed under special circumstances.\nNational team career.\nIn his youth, Pétur played 24 games for the Iceland junior national teams. Between 1978 and 1992, played 53 games for the Icelandic senior national team. Due to FIBA rules banning professional players to play for national teams, he was unable to play with the Icelandic national team for several years until the ban was lifted in 1989.\nCoaching career.\nAfter failing to receive a playing contract in the United States, Pétur signed as a player-coach for ÍR in January 1984. At the time of his arrival, ÍR was dead last in the Úrvalsdeild with only two victories in the first 11 games.

        "title": "Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball",
        "text": "The Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball team is part of the University of Iowa athletics department.\nThe Hawkeyes have played in 29 NCAA Tournaments, had eight National Invitation Tournament appearances, won eight Big Ten regular-season conference championships and won the Big Ten tournament three times. Iowa has played in the Final Four on three occasions, reaching the semifinals in 1955 and 1980 and playing in the championship game against the University of San Francisco in 1956.\nIowa basketball was widely successful in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s with a program resurgence under Lute Olson and the tenures of George Raveling and Tom Davis. Under Olson, the Hawkeyes won their last Big Ten regular season championship and went to the 1980 Final Four.\nThey currently play in 15,400-seat Carver-Hawkeye Arena, along with Iowa women's basketball, wrestling, and volleyball teams.\nPrior to playing in Carver-Hawkeye Arena, which opened in 1983, the Hawkeyes played in the Iowa Armory and the Iowa Field House, which is still used today by the school's gymnastics teams. In 2006, the Hawkeyes accumulated a school-record 21 consecutive wins at home before losing to in-state rival Northern Iowa.\nThree Iowa head coaches have been inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame as coaches: Sam Barry, Ralph Miller, and Lute Olson. A fourth Hawkeyes head coach, George Raveling, is a member in the Hall's contributor category.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1901–1922).\nThe roots of Iowa basketball lie in 1901, when Ed Rule coached the Hawkeyes to a 10–2 record in their very first season of varsity basketball. Earlier, when the sport was evolving and still in a club format, Iowa played the University of Chicago club in the first five-on-five college game on January 18, 1896. Rule coached the Hawkeyes in four non-consecutive seasons (1901–02, 03–04, 05–07), leading Iowa to a 37–15 record under his watch. Even today, Rule's winning percentage stands as the best among head coaches in Iowa basketball history.\nAside from Rule's tenure, the Hawkeyes were coached by: Fred Bailey (1902–1903), John Chalmers (1904–1905), John Griffith (1907–1910), Walter Stewart (1910–1912), Floyd Thomas (1912–1913), Maury Kent (1913–1918), Edwin Bannick (1918–1919), and James Ashmore (1919–1922). In the era of multiple sport coaches, Chalmers (24–8), Griffin (2–4), Kent (assistant) and Ashmore (assistant) also were Coaches of Iowa Hawkeyes football. Kent pitched briefly for the Brooklyn Dodgers and coached the Iowa Hawkeyes baseball team (42–26), as did Chalmers (24–6), Stewart (16–12), Ashmore (23–20) and Griffith (9–6). From 1902 to 1923, the best Iowa basketball finished in conference play was fifth on three separate occasions. Iowa began play in the Western Conference (1902–1917) which evolved and changed its name to the Big Ten Conference beginning in 1917–1918.\nSam Barry era (1922–1929).\nIn 1922, Sam Barry was hired as Iowa's 10th head coach. In Barry's first season, 1923, Iowa went 13–2 overall and won the Big Ten championship for the first time in school history. The winning did not stop there: the Hawkeyes also tied for the Big Ten championship in 1926, along with Indiana, Michigan, and Purdue. Barry also coached the Iowa Hawkeyes baseball team, going 19–15 from 1923 to 1924. Before Barry continued his Hall of Fame career at the USC in 1929, he authored a handbook on the sport, \"Basketball: Individual Play and Team Play\", featuring Iowa players and facilities. 62–54 at Iowa, Barry remained at USC until his premature death in 1950 at age 57. Barry was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 1979.\nRollie Williams era (1929–1942).\nFollowing Barry in the line of Hawkeye coaches was Rollie Williams, who would coach Iowa on two occasions, from 1929 to 1942 and in 1951. Williams' winning percentage of 51.5% (139–131), and his long tenure at Iowa allowed him to become the winningest coach in Iowa history until Lute Olson, Tom Davis and Fran McCaffery surpassed him.\nEarly during Williams' head coaching tenure, in 1929, Iowa's teams were suspended from participation in the Big Ten for violating conference rules. After a Big Ten investigation uncovered an illegal slush fund and possible recruiting violations, Iowa relented to the Big Ten's demands and was eventually reinstated into the conference on February 1, 1930. Fourteen players, including four on the basketball squad, were declared ineligible as a result of the Big Ten's findings.\nNile Kinnick, the 1939 Heisman Trophy winner for Iowa Hawkeyes football, also played basketball at Iowa. Starting for Coach Williams in 1937–38 as a sophomore, Kinnick finished 2nd on the team and 15th in Big Ten scoring with 75 total points (6.3 points per game) that season, his only hoops season.\nWilliams left the Hawkeyes in 1942 during World War II to enter military service in the Navy. He would return to Iowa after his tour of duty and coached one final season in 1950–51, after illness had forced Pop Harrison away from the sideline the previous season.\nOverall Williams had a 42-year tenure at the University of Iowa (1924 to 1966), working in various coaching capacities and moving into athletic administration at Iowa after his coaching career.\nPops Harrison era (1942–1950).\nJust as the country emerged from the depression, so did Iowa's basketball fortunes. Following a rocky 7–10 season in 1943, Pops Harrison led the Hawkeyes to their third overall Big Ten title (and first unshared title) in 1945.\nMurray Weir was the centerpiece of Pops Harrison's teams from 1944 to 1948, as Wier was a starter in all four-year season, playing under coach Harrison and developed into a prolific scorer, leading the NCAA in scoring. In 1944–45, the Hawkeyes won the Big Ten Conference season championship. The Hawkeyes finished second to the Michigan Wolverines in the Big Ten during Weir's his senior season of 1947–48.\nWier led the Hawkeyes in scoring in 1946–47 and 1947–48 with 15.1 and 21.0 points per game. Weir's 21.0 ppg led the NCAA in scoring in 1947–1948, with Wier becoming the first officially recognized Major College division scoring leader. Weir was a first team all–Big Ten selection and was selected as the Big Ten's Most Valuable Player. Weir was named a 1948 consensus first team All-American.\nIn the following decade, from 1946 to 1956, the Hawkeyes had but one non–winning season in 1948–49, Harrison's last full season as head coach. Illness forced Harrison miss a good portion of the 1949–50 season, coaching in 11 games.\nBucky O'Connor era (1949–1958).\nAfter playing and graduating from Drake University, O'Connor first came to Iowa from Boone Junior College in Boone, Iowa. He began at Iowa as the freshman basketball coach and Head Golf Coach in 1948. In 1950, O'Connor took over after the first two coaches of the 1949–50 season stepped down. He became the official coach in the 1951–52 season. Following short tenures by O'Connor in 1950 and Rollie Williams (with O'Connor assisting) for the entire 1950–51 season, in subbing for the ill Pops Harrison, O'Connor became Iowa's permanent coach in 1951. O'Connor would hold that position and achieve great success, until his death on April 22, 1958.\nChuck Darling was an early prominent player under O'Connor. Darling was a Consensus first–team All-American in (1952), along with being named 1952 First–team All-Big Ten. Darling was the 1st Round pick (#8 overall) of the Rochester Royals in the 1952 NBA draft. He played instead for the AAU Phillips 66ers in order to remain an amateur. He later played in the 1956 Olympics.\nThe Fabulous Five / back to back Final Fours.\nIn 1952–53, Iowa finished second in the Big Ten behind the efforts of a starting lineup fully composed of sophomores nicknamed the \"Fabulous Five:\"Sharm Scheuerman, Bill Seaberg, Carl Cain, Bill Schoof, and Bill Logan.\nAs juniors in 1954–55, Iowa, with the \"Fabulous Five\" won the Big Ten outright and eventually finished fourth in the nation. Iowa advanced to the Final Four of the 1955 NCAA tournament, defeating the Penn State 82–53 and Marquette 86–81 to advance.\nIn 1955–56, as seniors, Iowa again won the Big Ten outright and advanced to the Final Four of the 1956 NCAA tournament. They defeated Morehead State 97–83 and Kentucky and Coach Adolph Rupp 89–77 to advance to the Final Four. There, they defeated Temple 83–76 to advance to the NCAA Championship game. In the NCAA Final, Iowa lost to the San Francisco Dons with Bill Russell 83–71. San Francisco ended the season undefeated.\nDespite losing in the championship game, for the only time in school history, the Hawkeyes recorded consecutive Big Ten championships. Scheuerman, Seaberg, Cain, Schoof, and Logan, all members of the \"Fabulous Five\", had their jerseys retired in 1980.\n1956 USA Basketball Olympians.\nChuck Darling and Carl Cain were members of the 1956 United States men's Olympic basketball team that won the gold medal at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. Hall of famers Bill Russell and KC Jones were fellow team members. Darling averaged 9.3 points per game in the Olympics.\nO'Connor's death.\nOn April 22, 1958, at the age of 44, O'Connor died in a car accident near Waterloo, Iowa, killed in a collision with a truck on Highway 218. O'Connor, who had once coached Iowa's Golf team, was on his way to Waterloo to play golf before a speaking engagement with the Sports of Sorts Club in Waterloo.\nSharm Scheuerman era (1958–1964).\nAfter graduating from Iowa, Scheuerman had been hired as an assistant coach under Bucky O'Connor. Scheuerman was hired as head coach in 1958 after O'Connor was killed. At age 24, Scheuerman became the youngest head basketball coach in Big Ten Conference history. In six years as the Hawkeyes' head coach, Scheuerman's teams compiled a record of 72–69. Bob King was an assistant under Scheuerman from 1960 to 1962. Scheuerman resigned after the 1963–1964 season and entered private business. He later became an announcer for Iowa telecasts.\nA two-time All-American at Iowa, Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame Inductee and 5 x NBA Champion and Coach, Don Nelson, played for Iowa and Coach Scheuerman from 1959 to 1962. Nelson has the most wins as a coach in NBA history and his #19 is retired by the Boston Celtics.\nScheuerman recruited Naismith Hall of Fame player Connie Hawkins to Iowa in 1960. After enrolling at Iowa as a freshman, Hawkins was named in an investigation into gambling and point-shaving in his native New York City. Hawkins had borrowed and repaid $200 from former NBA player Jack Molinas and was questioned by the FBI without legal representation. He was banned and never played collegiately again, before embarking on a professional career. He eventually sued the NBA who had banned him, winning a $1.6 million settlement and reinstatement. Hawkins' #42 was retired by the Phoenix Suns.\nRalph Miller era (1964–1970).\nIowa enjoyed 5 years of success under Ralph Miller from 1965 to 1966 through 1969–70, winning two Big Ten conference titles during that span. Miller joined the Hawks as head coach after completing a successful stint as head coach at Wichita State.\nThe 1967–68 team tied for the Big Ten Title with Ohio State with a 10–4 conference record, and a 16–9 overall record. This team was led by Sam Williams, a high-scoring forward who led the Big Ten in scoring that year.\nThe 1969–70 team was arguably the greatest team in Iowa basketball history. Known as the \"Six-Pack\" (because only 6 players played most of the minutes), this team stormed through the Big Ten with a perfect 14–0 record, one of the few Big Ten teams ever to go undefeated in the conference. The team averaged over 100 points in conference play, highlighted by a 108–107 victory in West Lafayette over Purdue late in the season to clinch the outright title. Rick Mount of Purdue scored 61 points in that game in a losing effort.\nThe Six-Pack team was led by John Johnson and \"Downtown\" Fred Brown, who both enjoyed long and successful NBA careers after playing for the Hawkeyes, Johnson was the 1st round pick (#7) overall of the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 1970 NBA draft. Glenn \"the Stick\" Vidnovic and Chad Calabria also were Six-pack members. Iowa averaged almost 80% accuracy as a team from the free throw line for the season.\nMiller left Iowa after the 1969–70 season to accept the head coaching job at Oregon State, where he coached until 1989. Miller was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 1998.\nDick Schultz era (1970–1974).\nMiller and Scheuerman's assistant (and Iowa's baseball coach), Dick Schultz, succeeded Miller as head coach in 1970. A dual coach, Schultz had previously coached the Iowa Hawkeyes baseball team, going 129–106 from 1963 to 1970. Schultz was 41–55 overall during his four-year run as coach, with \"Downtown\" Freddie Brown and Kevin Kunnert becoming First Round NBA Draft Picks.\nBrown was the 1st round pick (#6 overall) of the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1971 NBA draft and Kunnert was the 1st round pick (#12 overall) of the Chicago Bulls in 1973 NBA draft.\nSchultz resigned in 1974, after four second-division finishes in the Big Ten and a 41–55 overall record. Schultz later became the executive director of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) from 1988 to 1993. He then became executive director of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) from 1995 to 2000.\nLute Olson era (1974–1983).\nIowa hired Long Beach State coach Lute Olson to replace Schultz in 1974. After progressive improvements from 1975 to 1977, Olson coached the Hawkeyes to five consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances from 1979 to 1983. \nThe 1978–79 squad earned a share the Big Ten Title.\n1980 Final Four.\nOlson's tenure was highlighted by an appearance in the Final Four in 1980 on a team led by Ronnie Lester, with a supporting cast of Kenny Arnold, Steve Waite, Steve Krafcisin, Vince Brookins, Kevin Boyle, Bobby Hanson, and Mark Gannon. Iowa started 7–0 on the season when Lester was injured early in the season at Dayton, not returning until the regular season finale.\nNineteen regular season wins earned Iowa a No. 5 seed in the East Regional of the NCAA Tournament (then, a 48-team field). In the four tournament wins that took Iowa to the Final Four, All-American Lester dished out 26 assists while committing only seven turnovers along with 51 points. Iowa opened by defeating Virginia Commonwealth 86–72 and No. 4 seed NC State 77–64. In a huge upset, Iowa knocked off No. 1 seed Syracuse 88–77, setting up a matchup in the Elite Eight with No. 3 Georgetown. Iowa earned an improbable Final Four trip to Indianapolis on March 16, 1980, defeating John Thompson's Georgetown squad 81–80. Iowa overcame a 10-point halftime deficit, making 17 of their final 21 shots and going 15–15 from the free-throw line. The winning basket was Steve Waite's three-point play in the closing seconds.\nIn the semi-final game against Denny Crum's Louisville team, Lester scored the first 10 points for Iowa. But after eight minutes of play he reinjured his knee and exited the game, ending his Iowa career. In Lester's absence, Louisville bested Iowa by only eight points, 80–72 and went on to win the Tournament, defeating UCLA, led by Larry Brown, in the final. Lester's value to his team was evident in the numbers. Not counting the Louisville game, they were 15–1 with Lester and 8–9 without him. Hall of Famer Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson, who played two seasons at Michigan State, once claimed Lester the toughest opponent he ever faced in the Big Ten. Lester was drafted 10th overall in the 1980 NBA draft, but the knee issues limited him in the NBA. He donated $100,000 to the University of Iowa in 2009.\nCareer at Iowa.\nAfter Olson coached the Hawkeyes to the 1980 Final Four, Iowa made the next three NCAA Tournaments. They advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in the 1983 NCAA tournament, his final season at Iowa. Then nicknamed \"The House That Lute Built\", Carver-Hawkeye Arena opened on January 5, 1983, replacing the Iowa Field House. After the 1982–1983 season, Olson left Iowa for the University of Arizona. Olson was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2002.\nGeorge Raveling era (1983–1986).\nWhen Lute Olson left for Arizona, George Raveling came to Iowa from Washington State, where he coached from 1972 to 1983. Raveling immediately recruited Michigan high school stars B. J. Armstrong, Bill Jones, and Roy Marble, Springfield, Illinois' Lanphier High School teammates Ed Horton and Kevin Gamble, as well as USC transfer Gerry Wright, and Les Jepsen, all of whom would go on to play in the NBA. During Raveling's three years with the Iowa program, the Hawkeyes made two trips to the NCAA Tournament, after his first Iowa team finished 13–15. Like Sam Barry decades before, Raveling left Iowa (after the 1985–86 season) to take the head coaching position at the University of Southern California after compiling a record of 55–38 at Iowa. Raveling was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2015.\nTom Davis era (1986–1999).\nDr. Tom Davis was hired after George Raveling departed. Davis coached the Hawkeyes for 13 seasons from 1986–87 to 1998–99. Davis had coached Lafayette (1971–1977), Boston College (1977–1982) and Stanford (1982–1986) prior to Iowa. Davis is Iowa's all time victory leader with 269 wins.\nDavis utilized a full court press defense and rapid continuous substitution. In 1986–1987, the Hawkeyes won their first 18 games and obtained the No. 1 ranking in the AP and UPI polls for the first time in school history. Iowa, with future NBA players Brad Lohaus, B. J. Armstrong, Ed Horton, Kevin Gamble, Bill Jones and Roy Marble, along with Jeff Moe won a school-record 30 games. Iowa finished 14–4 in the Big Ten and advanced to the Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament.\nIn the 1987 NCAA tournament #2 seed Iowa defeated Santa Clara 96–76, UTEP 84–82 and Oklahoma 93–91 to advance to the Elite Eight. In the Western Regional Final Iowa lost to #1 seed UNLV 84–81 after having a 16-point halftime lead. Kevin Gamble, who had hit the winning shot against the University of Oklahoma to send the Hawkeyes to the Elite Eight, shot a 3–pointer as time expired, but the shot bounced off the rim.\nRetaining B. J. Armstrong, Ed Horton, Bill Jones and Roy Marble, the Hawkeyes began the 1987–88 season ranked in the top five by most polls and publications. Iowa advanced to the Sweet Sixteen, avenging their loss to UNLV in the Second Round 106–89, before losing 99–79 to former coach Lute Olson's Arizona Wildcats.\nOn January 16, 1993, Iowa player Chris Street, a junior averaging 14.5 points and 9.5 rebounds on Iowa's 12–2 team, was killed in an accident with a snow plow in Iowa City. His # 40 was retired by Iowa.\nIn all, Davis led the Hawkeyes to nine NCAA Tournaments, winning every First Round game in the process. In his final season, Iowa advanced to the Sweet Sixteen before losing to eventual National Champion UConn. Under Davis the Hawkeyes also made two appearances in the National Invitational Tournament. He is the all–time winningest coach in Iowa history with 269 wins. He would later come out of retirement to rebuild the Drake University program before being succeeded at Drake by his son Keno Davis.\nSteve Alford era (1999–2007).\nSteve Alford, a former All-American as an Indiana Hoosier and a member of the Olympic gold-winning 1984 United States basketball team, arrived at Iowa after coaching Southwest Missouri State University to the 1999 NCAA Tournament Sweet 16. In his first game as coach of the Hawkeyes, Iowa defeated the defending national champion and No. 1-ranked Connecticut Huskies in Madison Square Garden. Iowa finished 14–16.\nDuring his second year (2000–01) the Hawkeyes' roster included Indiana transfer Luke Recker and Reggie Evans, who would lead the Big Ten Conference in rebounds and double-doubles during his two seasons with Iowa, as well as Iowa Mr. basketball 1997 Dean Oliver. However, after a knee injury sidelined Recker, the Hawkeyes dropped six of their last seven conference games, finishing 23–12 for the regular season and 7–9 in the Big Ten Conference regular season. Despite the setback, they battled back and won the Big Ten Conference tournament with four straight wins against Northwestern, Ohio State, Penn State, and Indiana. This earned them a #7 seed in the 2001 NCAA tournament, where they defeated Creighton in the first round but lost to Kentucky in the second round.\nThe Hawkeyes' conference record dropped to 5–11 during the 2001–02 season, but they defeated Purdue, Wisconsin, and Indiana in the Big Ten tournament before losing to Ohio State in the finals. The Hawkeyes played in the 2002 National Invitation Tournament, losing to LSU in the first round to finish with a 19–16 record. This was the first of three straight seasons that the Hawkeyes played in the NIT under Alford.\nIowa won the first two rounds of the 2003 tournament against Valparaiso and Iowa State before losing to Georgia Tech, finishing with a 17–14 record.

However, the Hawkeyes defeated Minnesota, Michigan State, and Ohio State to win the Big Ten tournament and finish 25–8 going into its third NCAA Tournament under Alford. They were ranked No. 11 nationally and seeded #3 in the Atlanta Regional of the 2006 NCAA tournament, but lost in a first-round upset to #14 seed Northwestern State 64–63, leaving Alford with only one NCAA Tournament win since taking over at Iowa. The game was lost on a last-second shot, and the Hawkeyes would not return to the Round of 64 in the NCAA Tournament until 2014–15.\nDuring the 2006–07 season, Alford led the Hawkeyes to an 8–6 non-conference record (which included a home loss to Drake for the first time in 40 years) and a 9–7 record in the Big Ten Conference. Iowa was not invited to the post-season, marking the first time since the 1976–77 season that a Hawkeye team with a winning record (17–14) failed to make either the NCAA Tournament or the NIT.\nAt the conclusion of the 2006–07 season, Alford resigned from the University of Iowa to accept the coaching position at the University of New Mexico.\nTodd Lickliter era (2007–2010).\nFollowing Alford's departure, Butler coach and reigning NABC Coach of the Year Todd Lickliter was hired. The graduation of Adam Haluska and the transfer of leading scorer Tyler Smith to Tennessee created a void. The 2007–2008 Hawkeyes would finish 13–19 for the season, including 6–12 in the Big Ten. The 2008–09 Hawkeyes would improve slightly to 15–17. The 2009–10 Hawkeyes dropped to 10–22.

The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) uses officially recognized All-America selectors to determine the consensus selections. Over time, the sources used to determine the consensus selections have varied. Currently, the NCAA uses four \"major\" selectors to determine consensus All-Americans: the Associated Press, The National Association of Basketball Coaches, the United States Basketball Writers Association and \"Sporting News\" magazine. Since 1984, the NCAA has applied a standardized point system to those teams designated as \"major\" All-American teams to determine consensus teams. The point system consists of three points for first team, two points for second team and one point for third team. No honorable mention or fourth team or lower are used in the computation. The top five totals plus ties are first team and the next five plus ties are second team. Many other publications and organization compile their own \"minor\" All-America teams in addition to the selectors listed here.\nThrough the 2023 season, 16 Iowa players have earned 21 All-America selections.

        "text": "The 1991 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament began on March 13 and ended on March 31. The tournament featured 48 teams. The Final Four event was hosted by the University of New Orleans, and held at the Lakefront Arena in New Orleans. The Final Four teams consisted of Tennessee, Stanford, Connecticut, and Virginia, with Tennessee defeating Virginia 70-67 (OT) to win its third NCAA title. Virginia's Dawn Staley was named the Most Outstanding Player of the tournament.\nThis tournament was the first to adopt the FIBA's 10ths-second clock during the final minute of each period, unlike whole seconds as in past seasons. One exception is Lakefront Arena, which was an AS&amp;I scoreboard and wasn't modified until summer 1991.\nNotable events.\nJames Madison earned an 8 seed and beat the 9 seed, Kentucky in a first round match-up. This set up a game between the Dukes, and the number 1 seed in the East Regional Penn State, with the game played on the Penn State home court. The game started out in favor of the home team, as they scored the first eleven points of the game, forcing JMU coach Sheila Moorman to call a timeout. The lead extended, with the Nittany Lions pulling out to a 24–9. The coach decided to stress defense and it helped, but Penn State held a 41–29 lead at halftime. The team continued to stress defense in the second half, and the Dukes held Penn State to six points in the first eight minutes of the second half. The Dukes took a lead, and were up by four points with under twelve minutes to go. Penn State cut the lead to two points, and with 19 seconds to go attempted a three-point shot for the win, but the shot was blocked, and JMU would upset the top seed. It was only the second time in the ten-year history of the NCAA tournament that a number 1 seed had failed to advance to the regional. Coincidentally, first time was in 1986 when number 1 seeded Virginia failed to reach the regional when they were defeated by James Madison.\n10th seeded Vanderbilt upset 7th seeded South Carolina, then went on to defeat the second seeded Purdue 69–63, to advance to the regional, where they would lose to Auburn. 10th seeded Lamar upset 7th seeded Texas, then went on to a 20-point victory over second seeded LSU. Oklahoma State faced Michigan State in a game that would go to three overtimes. Oklahoma State won 96–94.\nConnecticut defeated Clemson in the Regional final to earn their first trip to a Final Four. There they would take on one seeded Virginia. Connecticut's coach, Geno Auriemma started his women's basketball college coaching career as an assistant coach under Debbie Ryan at Virginia. In a game identified in 2009 as one of the top ten games in UConn history, Tonya Cardoza scored 16 points for the Cavaliers, including four three throws in the final second to help Virginia defeat Connecticut 61–55. Tonya Cardoza would go on to become an assistant coach at Connecticut for many years.\nIn the other semifinal game, Tennessee defeated Stanford 68–60 to advance to the championship game against Virginia. The Cavaliers would lead by five points with under two minutes to go, but Tennessee's Dena Head scored, was fouled, and converted the free throw to cut the margin to two points. Virginia failed to score, then fouled Head with seconds to go, who sank the free throws to send the game to overtime. Head continued to hit free throws in overtime, and the Volunteers went on to win the game and the national championship 70–67.\nQualifying teams – automatic.\nForty-eight teams were selected to participate in the 1991 NCAA Tournament. Twenty-one conferences were eligible for an automatic bid to the 1991 NCAA tournament.\nQualifying teams – at-large.\nTwenty-seven additional teams were selected to complete the forty-eight invitations.\nBids by conference.\nTwenty-one conferences earned an automatic bid. In ten cases, the automatic bid was the only representative from the conference. Two conferences, Metro Atlantic and Patriot sent a single representative as an at-large team. Twenty-five additional at-large teams were selected from ten of the conferences.\nFirst and second rounds.\nIn 1991, the field remained at 48 teams. The teams were seeded, and assigned to four geographic regions, with seeds 1-12 in each region. In Round 1, seeds 8 and 9 faced each other for the opportunity to face the 1 seed in the second round, seeds 7 and 10 played for the opportunity to face the 2 seed, seeds 5 and 12 played for the opportunity to face the 4 seed, and seeds 6 and 11 played for the opportunity to face the 3 seed. In the first two rounds, the higher seed was given the opportunity to host the first-round game. In most cases, the higher seed accepted the opportunity. The exceptions:\nThe following table lists the region, host school, venue and the thirty-two first and second round locations:\nRegionals and Final Four.\nThe Regionals, named for the general location, were held from March 22 to March 24 at these sites:\nEach regional winner advanced to the Final Four, held March 30 and March 31 in New Orleans, Louisiana at the Lakefront Arena, co-hosted by University of New Orleans &amp; Tulane University.\nBids by state.\nThe forty-eight teams came from thirty states, plus Washington, D.C.

The Final Four consisted of Connecticut, Penn St., Tennessee, and Rutgers, with Connecticut defeating Tennessee 71-52 to win its second NCAA title. Connecticut's Shea Ralph was named the Most Outstanding Player of the tournament.\nNotable events.\nTwo of the number one seeds advanced to the Final four – Tennessee and Connecticut – while two failed to advance. Penn State upset Louisiana Tech in the Midwest Regional, while Rutgers upset Georgia in the West Regional. Tennessee faced Rutgers in one of the Final Four match ups. At the end of the half, the Lady Vols held only a two-point lead 28–26. Pat Summitt challenged her players at halftime, and advised Tamika Catchings to move around more. That advice helped, as Catchings, who had only scored two points in the first half, scored eleven in the second half. Michelle Snow blocked seven shots in the game setting a Final Four record. Kara Lawson ran the offense, and scored a total of 19 points, of which 14 were scored in the second half, and ended up earning the Player of the Game award, helping her team win 64–54 and advance to the national championship.\nThe other semifinal match up was Connecticut against Penn State. The regional win by Penn State gave the team a chance to play in a Final Four in their home state. The Lady Lions were led by point guard Helen Darling, who would go on to win the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award that year. However, the defense by the Huskies held Darling scoreless on this day. UConn's point guard Sue Bird, had a better day, scoring 19 points, hitting five of her seven three point attempts. 20,060 fans were in the stands, the largest crowd ever to see a college basketball game in Pennsylvania. Connecticut had a nine-point lead at halftime, but Penn State had cut the lead to five points midway through the second half. However, the Huskies responded, and ended up winning the game by 22 points.\nThe match up in the finals between Tennessee and Connecticut was highly anticipated. The teams have met ten times prior to this meeting, with each team winning five. In eight of the ten meetings, one of the teams has had a number one ranking in the country. Much has been at stake, not just rankings, but winning streaks, national championships and pride.\nTennessee entered the final game on a 19-game winning streak; Connecticut on a 15-game winning streak, with their only loss of the season coming by a single point at the hands of Tennessee. UConn started the game with a 9–2 run. Kelly Schumacher set a record for blocks in a championship game, and had the record, with six, at halftime. She went on to record nine blocks, setting a new Final Four record, breaking the one established by Tennessee just two days before. The Huskies led 31–19 at the half, but the second half was yet to be played. Any chance of a comeback faded early, as UConn scored eight consecutive points to start the second half. Eight UConn players would get eleven or more minutes, giving Tennessee the impression that they were seeing fresh players every few minutes. Shea Ralph would score 15 points, on her way to winning the Most Outstanding Player award, and Svetlana Abrosimova scored 14. Connecticut ultimately defeated Tennessee by a score of 71–52 to win their second national championship.\nThe 2000 Final Four, played at the then-First Union Center (now Wells Fargo Center) in Philadelphia, was notable for featuring three head coaches who had ties to the Philadelphia area: Penn State coach Rene Portland grew up in the Philadelphia area, played at Immaculata College (now Immaculata University) in suburban Philadelphia, and briefly coached at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia; Rutgers coach C. Vivian Stringer coached at then-Cheyney State College (now Cheyney University) in suburban Philadelphia earlier in her career, and national championship-winning Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma spent most of his childhood living in Norristown, Pennsylvania, located approximately 20 miles from Philadelphia, and served as a high school and college assistant coach in the Philadelphia area early in his coaching career.\nQualifying teams – automatic.\nSixty-four teams were selected to participate in the 2000 NCAA Tournament.

The Final Four, held at the Savvis Center in St. Louis, Missouri, consisted of Connecticut, Notre Dame, Purdue, and Southwest Missouri State (now known as Missouri State), with Notre Dame defeating Purdue 68–66 to win its first NCAA title. Notre Dame's Ruth Riley was named the Most Outstanding Player of the tournament.\nNotable events.\nWith the Final Four held in the state of Missouri for the first time in NCAA history, 10th seeded University of Missouri rose to the occasion and upset 7th seeded Wisconsin in the first round. They then went on to play the 2nd seeded team from Georgia and won that game as well, advancing to the regional, where their bid to play in their home state ended in a loss to Louisiana Tech. Southwest Missouri State also did well. They were seeded 5th, so expected to win their first-round game, but they went on to upset 4th seed Rutgers to set up a game against the Regional's top seed, Duke. The Lady Bears then upset Duke 81–71 to head to the regional final against Washington, who had upset both Florida and Oklahoma. The upsets came to an end as Southwest Missouri State beat 6th seeded Washington 104–87 to advance to the Final Four, and a chance to play in front of home state fans.\nIn the Mideast Regional, the top four seeds all advanced to the regional semifinal, then both higher seeds were upset. 4th seed Xavier knocked off the number one seed in the regional, Tennessee, by a score of 80–65. Third seeded Purdue played second seeded Texas Tech in a game that came down to the wire. Purdue won 74–72, then went on to defeat Xavier for the spot in the Final Four against Southwest Missouri State. The upset run by Southwest Missouri State came to an end in the semifinal, as Purdue beat them 81–64. The career of Jackie Stiles, who had scored 1,064 points in 2000–01 to become the first player in NCAA Division I women's basketball history to score 1,000 points in a single season, thus came to an end.\nIn the Midwest and East regionals, both number one seeds advanced to the Final Four. Both Notre Dame and Connecticut were from the Big East and met in the other semifinal. The two teams had met twice before in the season, with Notre Dame winning at their home and UConn beating Notre Dame in the Big East Championship. Early in the game, the prior year National Champion Connecticut looked to be on their way to another championship game. The Huskies led at one point by 16 points in the first half. In the second half, Notre Dame came back, and with just over twelve minutes left, took their first lead of the game. Connecticut went into a scoring drought, going more than five minutes without a point. Notre Dame went on to win 90–75, to head to their first national championship game.\nThe championship game featured two teams from Indiana. Notre Dame began the game with a repeat of their performance against Connecticut, falling behind by double digits in the first half. The Irish were the best three-point shooting team in the country, but ended up hitting just one of ten attempts. Purdue's Katie Douglas scored 18 points for Purdue, with her final points being a three-pointer to put the Boilermakers in front 66–64 with a little over one minute left in the game. Notre Dame's Ruth Riley scored to tie the game, then rebounded a miss by Purdue. She then took a shot, missed, but was fouled with 5.8 seconds left in the game.

        "text": "The men's individual road race was an event at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. There were 154 participants from 61 nations, with 84 cyclists completing the race. The maximum number of cyclists per nation was three. The event was won by Fabio Casartelli of Italy, the nation's first victory in the men's individual road race since 1968 and fourth overall (two more than any other nation). Erik Dekker's silver was the first medal for the Netherlands in the event since 1972. Dainis Ozols gave Latvia its first medal in the event in the country's first independent appearance since 1936.\nBackground.\nThe race was the 14th event, after the interruption between 1896 and the summer of 1936. It replaced the individual time trial event that had been held from 1912 to 1932 (and which would be reintroduced alongside the road race in 1996). A young triathlete from the United States named Lance Armstrong was among the favorites, along with Erik Dekker of the Netherlands. \nAntigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Bahrain, Benin, the Central African Republic, Estonia, Guam, Lithuania, Rwanda, Slovenia, and the Virgin Islands each made their debut in the men's individual road race; some former Soviet republics competed as the Unified Team and some Yugoslav cyclists competed as Independent Olympic Participants. Great Britain made its 14th appearance in the event, the only nation to have competed in each appearance to date.\nCompetition format and course.\nThe mass-start race was on a 194.4 kilometre course over the Sant Sadurni Cycling Circuit.\nResults.\nDuring the penultimate lap, Casartelli, Dekker, and Ozols managed to break away from the lead pack; they maintained separation and finished in the medals with Casartelli winning the final sprint."

        "title": "United States men's national rugby sevens team",
        "text": "The United States national rugby sevens team competes in international rugby sevens competitions. The national sevens team is organized by USA Rugby, and the team has been led by Head Coach Mike Friday since 2014.\nThe main competition the team plays in every year is the World Rugby Sevens Series, a series of ten tournaments played around the globe from December to June that includes the USA Sevens tournament every spring. The Eagles have been a core team in the World Series and finished in the top twelve each season since 2008–09. The Eagles' best season in the Sevens Series has been a second-place finish in the 2018–19 Series. The best result in a single Sevens tournament was first place, which they have accomplished three times — winning the 2015 London Sevens and the 2018 and 2019 USA Sevens.\nThe team also participates in major tournaments every four years, such as the Summer Olympics, the Rugby World Cup Sevens, and the Pan American Games. Their best finishes in quadrennial events include finishing ninth at the 2016 Olympics, finishing sixth at the 2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens, and winning bronze medals at the 2011 and 2015 Pan American Games.\nThe United States had traditionally used the sevens team to prepare players for the XV-side. Since January 2012, due to increased attention generated by rugby's return to the Olympics in 2016, the national sevens team has turned professional, with the team extending paid full-time contracts to its players. The national sevens team has drawn a number of crossover athletes from other sports, the most prominent examples being Perry Baker (American football) and Carlin Isles (track). The U.S. also sometimes fields a developmental team, the USA Falcons, in several tournaments.\nHistory.\nThe earliest records of an American national rugby sevens team are from the 1986 and 1988 Hong Kong Sevens, where a team named the American Eagles won the Plate Final. The team competed as the United States national rugby sevens team at the inaugural 1993 Rugby World Cup Sevens. The U.S. competed in nine of the ten tournaments in the inaugural 1999–2000 World Sevens Series.\nWorld Rugby Sevens Series.\nThe World Rugby Sevens Series, which is played every year from December through June, is the primary annual competition for the U.S. national sevens team.\nEarly years (1999–2011).\nThe U.S. has competed in the World Series every year since the event's inaugural 1999–2000 season. The U.S. had some initial success during the early years of the tournament led by Jovesa Naivalu, who held the record for most tries scored until broken by Zack Test. However, the U.S. struggled in the five seasons from 2002–03 through 2006–07.\nThe 2007–08 season was a turning point for the U.S. team, qualifying for 6 of the 8 series tournaments, and defeating France and Samoa en route to placing sixth at the 2007 South Africa Sevens. The team was led by Chris Wyles who scored 26 tries on the season. The IRB rewarded the Eagles' success by promoting the U.S. to \"core\" team status for the 2008–09 season, meaning that the U.S. automatically plays in all 8 tournaments without having to go through qualifying rounds.\nThe 2008–09 season was a breakout season for the U.S., finishing 11th on the season. The high point of the team's season was the home tournament, the 2009 USA Sevens. Nese Malifa's 30 points in that tournament helped the U.S. reach the semifinals, their best result to that time on home soil.\nThe 2009–10 season saw continued improvement, with the team finishing the season in 10th place. Led by Matt Hawkins and Nese Malifa, the team finished ninth to win the Bowl in the 2010 USA Sevens. The U.S. then advanced to their first ever Cup final at the 2010 Adelaide Sevens, scoring upset wins against England, Wales and Argentina.\nDuring the 2010–11 season the team took a small step back with a 12th-place finish. A number of key players were unavailable for most or all of the season, including the previous season's leading try scorer Nick Edwards and leading point scorer Nese Malifa. Additionally, a number of competing teams had moved to professional status, leaving the mostly amateur U.S. team struggling to keep pace.\nProfessional era begins (2011–2014).\nThe 2011–12 season saw significant changes for the U.S. The team turned professional in January 2012, with contracts for up to 15 players. The change to professional status did not bring immediate improvement. Head coach Al Caravelli resigned, and Alex Magleby was selected as the new head coach. The U.S. finished the 2011–12 season in 11th, a slight improvement over the previous season, even though the team did not reach the quarterfinals of any of the 9 tournaments. Bright spots for the season included the emerging leadership of Shalom Suniula (captain), Zack Test (team leading 21 tries) and Colin Hawley.\nThe 2012–13 Series saw a slightly different format, with 15 core teams instead of 12, but with the possibility of relegation for the teams that finished in the bottom three. The U.S. got off to a slow start, ranked last among the 15 core teams after the first two legs. The U.S. saw improvement, however, reaching the quarterfinals in five of the last seven tournaments, and finishing in the top 6 during the last three tournaments. The U.S. finished fifth to win the Plate Final at the 2013 Japan Sevens, the first time the U.S. had won a plate since 2001, and followed that feat by again finishing fifth to win the Plate Final at the 2013 Scotland Sevens, with Nick Edwards the leading try-scorer in the tournament with 8 tries. The U.S. finished the season in 11th place, and had two players among the season's top try-scorers: Nick Edwards (20) and Zack Test (18). Coach Alex Magleby stepped down after the season.\nThe U.S. team fared poorly during the 2013–14 Series under new coach Matt Hawkins, finishing the season in 13th place. Once again, Zack Test led the team with 23 tries and 119 points on the season; other leading scorers included Carlin Isles with 17 tries, including six at the 2014 Wellington Sevens, and newcomer Madison Hughes with 34 goals scored. Hawkins was blamed for the exodus of several veteran players, such as Colin Hawley and Shalom Suniula, and was asked to step down at the end of the season.\nTop 6 finishes (2014–present).\nThe U.S. had its best season ever in the 2014–15 Series under head coach Mike Friday, who was hired in summer 2014. The U.S. finished sixth in the series, its best finish to date. The team capped off the season by winning the 2015 London Sevens after defeating Australia in the cup final, the first time the U.S. has won a World Series tournament. Carlin Isles set a U.S. record with 32 tries for the season and Madison Hughes set a record with 296 points.\nThe U.S. began the 2015–16 Series by \"shocking the world\" when it defeated New Zealand for the first time at 2015 Dubai Sevens. The team beat the 12-time World Series champion in pool play and again in the tournament's third-place match before a third victory in as many matches in the 2015 South Africa Sevens Plate Semifinal. The U.S. once again finished the season in sixth, tying its best ever finish. The previous season's scoring records were broken again, as Perry Baker notched 48 tries and Madison Hughes scored 331 points.\nThe U.S. began the 2016-17 World Series slowly, sitting in 11th place after the first three rounds. The U.S. was missing certain key players from the previous season. The U.S. turned things around mid-season. In the second half of the season, the team for the first time reached four consecutive semifinals: first at the USA Sevens where the U.S. finished third; then at the Canada Sevens where Perry Baker scored 9 tries including his 100th career try; followed by Hong Kong and Singapore. The U.S. finished the season in fifth place overall, a record high for the team. Perry Baker was the season's leading try scorer (57) and points scorer (285) on the Series, whereas Madison Hughes ranked third in points (279). Perry Baker and Danny Barrett were both selected to the 2016-17 Dream Team, and Baker was selected as the 2017 World Rugby Sevens Player of the Year.\nThe 2017–18 season began badly for the U.S. In the first tournament in Dubai, Baker suffered a concussion, and the rest of the team limped to a last place finish. The U.S. improved from that point on, reaching the semifinals of the Australia Sevens. The team then won the 2018 USA Sevens, the first time the U.S. won their home tournament, boosted in large part by Perry Baker, who led all scorers with 8 tries; Baker, along with forwards Ben Pinkelman and Danny Barrett all made the tournament Dream Team. Overall the team displayed inconsistent performances, reaching the Cup semifinals three times, but also failing to qualify for the cup quarterfinals three times. Despite the inconsistent play, the U.S. finished sixth overall.\nThe U.S. got off to a strong start in the 2018–19 season. The team reached the finals in Dubai, South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia, the first time the U.S. had reached four consecutive finals and was ranked joint first in the overall Series after the first four legs. In the fifth leg, the U.S. won beating Samoa 27–0. This was the U.S.’s second straight USA Sevens win, giving them sole possession of first place in the Sevens World Series. The U.S. remained in first place for several more tournaments, but consecutive semifinal losses to Fiji in the last two tournaments in London and Paris meant that Fiji won the Series with the U.S. finishing second. The U.S. overall had its best season ever — the second place finish beating their previous best of fifth. Additionally, qualifying for five consecutive tournament finals as well as reaching the semifinals in all ten tournaments were U.S. records. Carlin Isles scored 52 tries, ranked first overall among all players.\nThe U.S. started slowly in the 2019–20 season; with the team resting some players who had played at the October 2019 Rugby World Cup, the team sat in eighth place after the first two events.\nSeason by season.\n\"*At the start of the 2016–17 season, the plate and shield awards were abandoned, with the bowl replaced by the Challenge Trophy.\" &lt;br&gt;\n\"Updated as of April 8, 2024\"\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nThe following players have been selected to represent the United States during the 2023–24 SVNS tournament beginning in December 2023.\nPlayer pool.\nA pool of American full-time professional rugby players train year round at the Olympic Training Center in San Diego. The twelve players selected for tournament rosters are generally drawn from this training squad. For particularly high-profile tournaments such as the Olympics, the U.S. sometimes draws from American players who are playing rugby professionally abroad.\nUSA Rugby has since January 2012 provided full-time salaried contracts to players. Previously, players had been part-time semi-pro players paid a stipend for their participation. USA Rugby CEO Nigel Melville stated that a full-time sevens team is a crucial step as USA Rugby prepares for rugby's return to the Olympics in 2016.\nThe inclusion of rugby sevens in the Olympics had greatly expanded funding available to the sport in the U.S. The large pool of American football players who may be unable to earn professional contracts in the NFL meant there may be athletes with skills that could transfer to rugby union.\nTournament history.\nSummer Olympics.\nAlthough the fifteens version of rugby union had last appeared in the Olympics at the 1924 Games, rugby sevens made its debut at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. The U.S. qualified for the 2016 Olympics by defeating Canada 21–5 in the final of the 2015 NACRA Sevens. At the 2016 Olympics, the U.S. went 1–2 in pool play, narrowly missing the quarterfinals due to a 14–17 loss to Argentina. The U.S. finished in ninth place, with Carlin Isles scoring six tries and Danny Barrett scoring four tries. The U.S. defeated Canada 24-14 in the 2023 RAN Sevens to clinch a spot at the 2024 Olympics.\nRugby World Cup Sevens.\nThe U.S. has participated in every Rugby World Cup Sevens since the tournament's inception in 1993. The team's best performance to date has been its sixth-place finish at the 2018 tournament, which was held on home soil.\nPan American Games.\nThe U.S. has played rugby sevens at every Pan Am Games since the sport was introduced at the 2011 Games. At the 2011 Games, the U.S. lost 19–21 to Canada in the semifinals before defeating Uruguay 19–17 for the bronze. At the 2015 Games, the U.S. again lost to Canada 19–26 in the semifinals and defeated Uruguay 40–12 to capture their second consecutive bronze. At the 2019 Games, a weakened U.S. side that left its regular starters at home defeated Brazil 24–19 to take the bronze medal.\nRegional qualifier tournaments.\nThe U.S. has played in several North American regional tournaments, often as a qualifying tournament for the Rugby World Cup Sevens or another event.\nOther international competitions.\n\"*\" – Played as the USA Cougars\nPlayer records.\nThe following tables show the U.S. career leaders in major statistical categories in the World Rugby Sevens Series.

A ranking title is a tournament that counts towards the snooker world rankings. World rankings were introduced in the 1976–77 season, initially based on the results from the previous three World Championships. This meant that the 1974 World Championship retrospectively became the first ranking event, won by Ray Reardon.\nUntil 1982, the World Championship was the only ranking event. In the 1982–83 season, two more ranking events were added to the snooker calendar: the International Open and the Professional Players Tournament. In 1984, the UK Championship, initially a non-ranking tournament, became a ranking event for the first time. More ranking tournaments were established over the years. In the 2018–19 season, there were twenty events worth ranking points.\nList of winners.\nRonnie O'Sullivan holds the record for the most ranking titles, with 41.

Wins in these tournaments are referred to as \"minor-ranking titles\". There were a total of 69 minor-ranking tournaments; four in the 1992–93 season with the remainder played from 2010 to 2016 as part of the Players Tour Championship.\nMark Selby had the most wins in minor-rankings events with seven.

He played college football for the Nebraska Cornhuskers\nBiography.\nWalker became profoundly deaf from meningitis at the age of two, and was the third of only five players in the history of the National Football League to have some form of deafness. Walker followed Larry Brown, who played with the Washington Redskins from 1969 to 1976 and Bonnie Sloan, who was a member of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1973. Walker was subsequently followed by Flozell Adams, who played with the Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers from 1998 to 2010 and Derrick Coleman, a member of the Seattle Seahawks, Atlanta Falcons and Arizona Cardinals from 2012 to 2018.\nWalker starred at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. At his final home game for the Cornhuskers, the capacity crowd showed their appreciation for Walker by signing \"applause\" to him in unison. After playing in the Senior Bowl, the Broncos selected him in the eighth round (200th overall) of the 1991 NFL Draft.\nWalker emerged as a regular for the Broncos in 1991, playing in all 16 games. The following year, he started in all but one of the team's games, but his career ended after that. Following his time in the NFL, Walker played a short, three-season stint in the Canadian Football League with the Calgary Stampeders (1994-1995) and Winnipeg Blue Bombers (1995-1996), becoming the first deaf player in the history of the CFL. Additionally, Walker sued the Denver Broncos in 1995 for violating the Americans with Disabilities Act by misrepresenting his disability to other NFL teams. The outcome of the suit was not reported.\nWalker published an autobiography \"Roar of Silence: The Kenny Walker Story\" in 1998, and also has a chapter dedicated to him in the book \"Great Deaf Americans\".\nIn September 2010, Walker was hired as the defensive line coach at Gallaudet University, a federally-charted private university for the deaf that plays football in NCAA Division III. He would leave this position after only one season with the Gallaudet Bisons. Prior to this, Walker was a coach and counselor at the Iowa School for the Deaf.\nIn 2014, Walker was back in Denver, working as an assistant coach with the Highlands Ranch track team."

        "text": "A team of Amateurs under the captaincy of Arthur Priestley toured the West Indies in the 1896-97 season playing matches between January and March 1897. They played a total of sixteen matches of which nine are regarded as first-class. They did not play in British Guiana.\nThe team.\nA party of thirteen was taken:\nBush, Barratt and Priestley had been in the Slade Lucas tour to the West Indies two year previously. Priestley had played a single first-class match for the M.C.C. in 1895 but otherwise none of the 3 had played first-class cricket between the two tours. Elliott had not played first class cricket before the tour while Williams and Leigh had not played first-class cricket for almost 10 years. However the remaining 7 had played first-class cricket in 1896 and so the team was clearly stronger than Lucas's two years earlier. In 1896 Palairet, Stanley and Woods had played for Somerset, Beldam and Stoddart for Middlesex, Stone for Leicestershire and Lewis for Oxford University. Stoddart had played for England during the 1896 season while Woods had played against South Africa in 1895–96. All the 13 played at least three first-class matches on the tour. G.A. Maclean played in a minor match.\nThe tour.\nThe team left Southampton on December 30 and arrived back in England on April 14.\nMatches played were:\nFirst class matches are highlighted.\nOf the 9 first class matches, 4 were won and 5 lost. Overall 10 matches were won, 5 lost and 1 drawn. All 5 matches in Jamaica were won, Gilbert Livingston being the only effective player for Jamaica. The results achieved by the tourists were regarded as disappointing, Stoddart being the one great success.\nStoddart was the leading batsman scoring over 1000 runs in all games at an average of over 50. In first-class matches he scored 416 runs at an average of 27. He scored all 6 of the centuries scored by the tourists including 2 in first-class games. Stoddart was also the leading bowling with over 100 wickets in all matches at an average under 8 and over 50 in first-class games alone averaging under 10.\nThe most important match was that against All West Indies in Port of Spain in February. The West Indies team contained players from Trinidad, British Guiana and Barbados and was captained by Aucher Warner, the brother of Plum Warner. The tourists set their opponents 141 to win in the last innings which they achieved for the loss of 7 wickets, having been 41–6 at one stage. Richard Palairet was leading scorer in both the tourists' innings with 45 and 46. Clifford Goodman and Archie Cumberbatch took 9 wickets each for the West Indians as did Andrew Stoddart for the tourists. The leading batsmen for the West Indies were Harold Austin and Lebrun Constantine.\nAverages.\nThe following averages are in the 9 first class matches (Batting Bowling)."

They played a total of 14 matches of which 7 are regarded as first class. They did not play in Jamaica.\nBackground.\nLord Hawke had been invited to take the 1894–95 team to the West Indies but had had to withdraw, the team being captained instead by R. Slade Lucas. It was understood however that he would try to take a side out in 1896–97 and following an invitation he set about organising a tour. But his telegram accepting the invitation was never received and another group of tourists under A. A. Priestley having accepted an invitation from Jamaica were organising their own tour.\nLord Hawke met Priestley but the two could not come to a compromise and both decided to go independently. It would appear from the correspondence published that Lord Hawke treated Priestley in a rather high-handed manner.\nTour.\nA party of 12 was taken:\nBerens, Bromley-Davenport, Dawson and Wakefield had been in the Lucas tour to the West Indies two years previously. Bromley-Davenport had played regularly for Middlesex in 1896 and also against South Africa in 1895-96 but the other 3 had not played first-class cricket between the two tours. Whatman and Wickham had not played first-class cricket before the tour while Heseltine had played first-class cricket in 1895 but not in 1896. The remaining 5 had played first class cricket in 1896 and so, like Priestley's tourists, the team was somewhat stronger than Lucas's two years earlier. In 1896 Lord Hawke had played for Yorkshire, Bardswell for Oxford University and Lancashire, Leatham a single match for M.C.C., Leveson-Gower for Oxford University and a single match for Surrey and Warner for Oxford University and 4 matches for Middlesex. Lord Hawke and Heseltine had also played against South Africa in 1895-96. All the 12 played at least three first-class matches on the tour. Oscar Weber played in the last match of the tour against British Guiana. He had previously played for All West Indies against A.A. Priestley's XI. Mr. St. G.M. de Roebuck and Capt. Hon. M. Bourke played in a minor match.\nThe team left Southampton on January 13.\nMatches played were:\nFirst-class matches are highlighted.\nOf the 7 first-class matches, 3 were won, 2 lost and 2 drawn. Overall 9 matches were won, 2 lost and 3 drawn. The tourists had a break from cricket between the last matches when they sailed up the Demerara river.\nWarner was the great success amongst the batsmen scoring 984 runs including 4 centuries in all matches. Bardswell and Leveson-Gower were also successful in the first-class games.\nBromley-Davenport was the most successful bowler but missed a number of matches with a broken finger.\nAverages.\nThe following averages are in the 7 first class matches (Batting Bowling).\nBatting.\nWeber was a local who played in other first class matches during the season."

He is the former head men's basketball coach at Albany, where he served from 2002 to 2021, guiding the Great Danes to five NCAA tournament appearances.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in Miller Place, New York, Brown played collegiate basketball at Dowling College, starting for three years. He finished his career as the school's all-time leader in assists, three-point field goals and free-throw percentage, and is the only player in Dowling history to score 1,000 points and tally 500 assists.\nCoaching career.\nBrown began his coaching career at The College of Saint Rose, serving as an assistant coach for three seasons. He then became the head coach at Sullivan County Community College, compiling a record of 90–10 in three seasons. Brown joined the coaching staff at the University at Albany as an assistant coach for the 2001–02 season, and was named interim head coach on December 20, 2001 after head coach Scott Beeten was fired. On March 13, 2002, UAlbany removed the \"interim\" tag from Brown's title and officially named him as its 15th head coach.\nIn his fourth full season on the job, Brown led the Great Danes to their first-ever America East conference regular season and tournament championship, as well as its first Division I NCAA Tournament appearance. With the help of two-time America East Player of the Year Jamar Wilson, the team won the America East conference tournament title in 2007 and returned to the NCAA tournament in 2007.\nFrom the 2012–13 season to the 2014–15 season, Brown guided Albany to three straight America East titles and NCAA appearances, adding his second conference regular season title in the process. His fifth conference tournament title tied Jim Calhoun for the highest total in America East history. In 2019, Brown earned his 300th career victory as the coach of the Great Danes when the team defeated Niagara.\nOn March 1, 2021, Brown and Albany agreed to mutually part ways at the expiration of his contract. Brown's career record at the University at Albany was 315–295.\nOn October 27, 2021, the Albany Patroons of The Basketball League announced that the team had hired Brown as its head coach and general manager for the 2022 season. In his only season with the Patroons, Brown guided the team to a 29–4 record and was named the TBL National Coach of the Year. Brown led the Patroons to The Basketball League Northeast Division Championship, Easter Regional Championship and the Eastern Conference Championship before stepping down from the position on December 17, 2022. \nBrown was named the head coach of the women's basketball team at Division II Saint Rose on June 23, 2023. He took over a team that had won 11 games the year prior and guided them to a 21–7 mark and a third-place finish in the Northeast-10 Conference and guiding the team to the 2024 NCAA Division II tournament for the first time since the 2010–11 season, and in the final year of the school's existence, as it was announced Saint Rose would close at the end of the 2023–24 academic year."

        "text": "The men's individual road race at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, was held on Wednesday, 27 September 2000 (the second day of competition of the games) with a race distance of 239.4 km. The estimated global TV audience was 600 million. They were specifically held in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs. There were 154 cyclists from 41 nations competing. The maximum number of cyclists per nation had been five since professionals were allowed in 1996. The event was won by Jan Ullrich of Germany, the nation's first victory in the men's individual road race (though Olaf Ludwig of East Germany had won in 1988). His teammate Andreas Klöden's bronze made this race the first time one nation had taken two medals in the event since 1988—when West Germany had done so by taking silver and bronze (making an all-German podium then, with Ludwig's gold). Alexander Vinokourov took silver for Kazakhstan's first medal in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the 16th appearance of the event, previously held in 1896 and then at every Summer Olympics since 1936. It replaced the individual time trial event that had been held from 1912 to 1932; the time trial had been re-introduced in 1996 alongside the road race. The change to including professionals in 1996 meant that 2000 was the first Games that saw significant repeat competitors in the event (which had typically seen top cyclists turn professional after one appearance); Atlanta silver medalist Rolf Sørensen of Denmark and bronze medalist Max Sciandri of Great Britain returned. Favorites were \"difficult\" to select for the one-day race. Lance Armstrong (1999 and 2000 Tour de France winner) and Jan Ullrich (1997 Tour de France winner) were among the prominent cyclists, but the road race was a very different event from a Tour and \"neither was considered a great sprinter\".\nEgypt and Kyrgyzstan each made their debut in the men's individual road race. Great Britain made its 16th appearance in the event, the only nation to have competed in each appearance to date.\nCompetition format and course.\nThe mass-start race was on a 239.4 kilometre course over the Cycling Road Course in Sydney's Centennial Parklands. The distance had been increased from previous Olympic road races (particularly pre-1996, though the distance was nearly 20 kilometres more than 1996 as well) to be more consistent with professional races.\nResults.\nA three-cyclist breakout occurred with 25 kilometres to go: Ullrich and two of his Deutsche Telekom teammates, Vinokourov and Klöden."

Amongst the teams he played with were the Ottawa Senators and Toronto Ontarios. He won two Stanley Cups in 1909 and 1911 with Ottawa.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in Moosomin, Saskatchewan (then in the Northwest Territories), Fred Lake first played senior-level hockey for the Moosomin Hockey Club in 1900–01. In 1902, he turned professional with the Pittsburgh Keystones of the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League (WPHL). In 1903, he played for the Portage Lakes Hockey Club (of Houghton, Michigan) that claimed the \"US Professional Championship\". For 1903–04, he would sign up for the new International Professional Hockey League (IPHL) first playing for the Michigan Soo Indians in Sault Ste.

As a member of the Maple Leafs he would play in an unsuccessful Stanley Cup challenge against the Montreal Wanderers in 1908.\nFor the 1908–09 season, Lake signed with the Pittsburgh Athletic Club of the WPHL. However, after three games he was released because of his rough play. He was signed by the Ottawa Hockey Club of the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECHA) and helped Ottawa win the Stanley Cup. In the early years of his hockey career Lake had been a left winger, but with Ottawa he was converted into a defenceman. He would remain a player with Ottawa for four seasons, winning another Stanley Cup championship in 1911, before being traded to the Toronto Ontarios in 1913, where he played for one season. For his final season, he returned via a trade to Ottawa. He only played two games for the Senators that season and retired after the season.\nDeath.\nFred Lake was found dead in his car in an unoccupied shed at the rear end of a vacant house near Connaught Park Racetrack in Aylmer, Quebec near Ottawa on November 30, 1937, with the exhaust pipe of the automobile connected to the inside of the vehicle. Cause of death was deemed asphyxiation by carbon monoxide gas. He had been involved in a motor accident two years prior and had been in ill health ever since the accident. He was 54 years old."

In 2013, Johnson became the first American League (AL) pitcher ever to have recorded back-to-back seasons of 50 saves or more. Johnson and Éric Gagné are the only two MLB pitchers to accomplish this feat.\nEarly life.\nJohnson was born in Johnson City, New York. He was raised in Endicott, New York, and graduated from Union Endicott High School in 2001.\nBaseball career.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nThe Baltimore Orioles drafted Johnson in the fifth round (143rd overall) of the 2001 MLB draft. He made his major league debut on July 29, 2006 against the Chicago White Sox, allowing eight earned runs in three innings for the loss. In 2007, he again only made one Major League appearance.\nJohnson began the 2008 season in the Triple-A Norfolk Tides starting rotation, but was called up to the Orioles on April 12. Pitching middle and late relief, he ran up 18 consecutive scoreless innings before giving up a 10th inning run to Oakland on May 5. He became the interim closer when George Sherrill went on the disabled list on August 19, 2008. Johnson finished the season 2–4 with one save and a 2.23 ERA in 54 games.\nJohnson was given the closer role on July 30, 2009, when Sherrill was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers. He finished with 10 saves, but his ERA rose higher, finishing at 4.11 in 70 innings of relief. In the 2010 season, he returned to a setup role. Late in the 2011 season, Johnson won the closer role from Kevin Gregg.\nOn January 16, 2012, Johnson signed a one-year deal worth $2.625 million, avoiding arbitration. He won the Delivery Man of the Month Award for May 2012. On July 1, 2012, Johnson was one of three Orioles selected to play in the 2012 All Star Game. On September 21, 2012, Johnson set the Orioles' all-time single season save record at 46, passing Randy Myers. Johnson recorded his 50th save of the season on September 30 during a victory over the Boston Red Sox. With the win, Baltimore clinched a postseason berth, and Johnson became the 10th pitcher in MLB history to record 50 saves or more. He finished the season with 51 saves. He won the AL Rolaids Relief Man Award.\nJohnson had a mediocre postseason debut through four games in the 2012 American League Division Series against the New York Yankees. Johnson struggled in Game 1 of the series at Camden Yards, entering in the ninth inning of a 2–2 game and surrendering five runs (four earned) in only of an inning. The Yankees won, 7–2. He gained redemption in Game 2, pitching a perfect ninth inning to preserve a 3–2 advantage, striking out Alex Rodriguez on a 3–2 count to end the game. Johnson pitched again in Game 3 in the Bronx and surrendered a game-tying home run to Raúl Ibañez with one out in the ninth inning. (Ibañez would also win the game on a homer in the 12th off of Brian Matusz.) Johnson earned a successful save in game four, working a scoreless 13th inning.\nJohnson recorded his 100th career save against the New York Yankees on June 30, 2013.\nOakland Athletics.\nOn December 2, 2013, Johnson was traded to the Oakland Athletics for infielder Jemile Weeks and a player to be named later, identified as David Freitas on December 12. The deal was considered to be a salary dump by the Orioles, since Johnson was projected to make $10.8 million in baseball arbitration, according to MLB Trade Rumors. His 2014 salary wound up being $10 million. Johnson's first season with the A's began poorly, as he earned a blown save and two losses in his first two appearances with the club. After five appearances and an ERA of 18.90, Johnson was pulled from the closer role on April 11, in favor of fellow relievers such as Luke Gregerson and Sean Doolittle. Johnson was designated for assignment on July 24, and released by the club on August 1. In 38 games with Oakland, he was 4–2 with two saves and a 7.14 ERA.\nDetroit Tigers.\nOn August 5, 2014, Johnson signed a minor-league contract with the Detroit Tigers. On August 16, the Tigers called up Johnson to the main roster. To make room on the 25-man roster, the Tigers optioned Melvin Mercedes back to Triple-A Toledo, and to make room on the 40-man roster, the Tigers designated Kevin Whelan for assignment. Johnson made his debut for the Tigers on August 17 against the Seattle Mariners, coming in to pitch the sixth inning and allowing two hits, three runs, one walk, and one strikeout in innings. In 16 games with the Tigers, he was 1–0 with a 6.92 ERA.\nAtlanta Braves.\nJohnson signed a one–year contract worth $1.6 million with the Atlanta Braves on December 3, 2014. Johnson, who had been the set-up man for most of the year, was called on to be the closer after Jason Grilli was injured on July 11, two days before the All-Star break. In 49 games, he was 2–3 with nine saves and a 2.25 ERA.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nOn July 30, 2015, in a three-team trade, the Los Angeles Dodgers acquired Johnson, Mat Latos, Michael Morse, Bronson Arroyo, Alex Wood, Luis Avilán, and José Peraza, while the Miami Marlins acquired minor league pitchers Victor Araujo, Jeff Brigham, and Kevin Guzman, and the Braves received Héctor Olivera, Paco Rodriguez, minor league pitcher Zachary Bird and a competitive balance draft pick for the 2016 MLB draft. He struggled with the Dodgers, going 0–3 while allowing 22 runs in innings (10.13 ERA). He did not make the postseason roster and the Dodgers designated him for assignment on October 14, 2015.\nAtlanta Braves (second stint).\nOn November 30, 2015, Johnson signed a one-year, $2.5 million deal to return to the Braves. For the final week of July 2016, Johnson earned NL Player of the Week honors. He finished the 2016 season with a 2–6 record, 20 saves and 3.06 ERA, his lowest since 2013, in 65 games.\nJohnson then signed a two-year extension on October 2, 2016. He struggled the following season with the Braves, going 6–5 with 22 saves and a 5.56 ERA. He also recorded nine blown saves.\nLos Angeles Angels.\nOn November 30, 2017, the Braves traded Johnson and $1.21 million in international bonus signing cash to the Los Angeles Angels in return for minor league pitcher Justin Kelly. In his first season with the Angels, Johnson appeared in 62 games, going 5–3 with two saves while registering an ERA of 3.84 in innings. He elected free agency on October 29.\nPitching style.\nJohnson throws four pitches, leading with a hard sinker averaging . His main off-speed pitch to right-handed hitters is a curveball averaging about . Against lefties, Johnson adds an upper-80s changeup. Lastly, he throws an occasional four-seam fastball in the mid 90s."

        "title": "Mike Hopkins (basketball)",
        "text": "Michael Griffith Hopkins (born August 6, 1969) is an American college basketball coach who was the head coach for the Washington Huskies men's team of the Pac-12 Conference. He was a longtime assistant at Syracuse University before taking over for Washington in 2017.\nThe 6-foot-5 Hopkins, from Laguna Hills, California, was a fan favorite during his playing days at Syracuse, known for his all-out hustle and general scrappy play.\nHigh school career.\nBorn in the Northern California city of San Mateo and raised in the Southern California city of Laguna Hills, Hopkins was a member of the 1987 California state championship team at Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, California that also featured future NBA player LeRon Ellis. Having graduated from Mater Dei in 1988, Hopkins enrolled at Syracuse while Ellis went on to a two-year career at the University of Kentucky. After Kentucky was placed on probation, Hopkins would play an instrumental role in convincing his high school teammate to transfer to Syracuse.\nCollege career.\nHopkins played sparingly in his first two seasons at Syracuse before becoming the team's starting shooting guard in his junior year. That year, Hopkins hit the game-winning free throws with three seconds remaining against Connecticut to propel the Orange to the 1992 Big East Championship.\nHopkins was named captain in his senior season and posted a career high of 9.2 points and added 3.7 rebounds per game. He also had a flair for the clutch, heaving a three-quarter court pass to Conrad McRae for a buzzer-beating, game-winning shot against Villanova. In his final game in the Carrier Dome, Hopkins scored a game-high 20 points and tallied six rebounds and five assists in a 78–74 win over Pittsburgh.\nHopkins played 111 games throughout his four-year career spanning from 1989 to 1993. He finished with averages of 5.7 points and 2.8 rebounds per game.\nProfessional career.\nHopkins spent time in the Continental Basketball Association with the Minnesota-based Rochester Renegade and he also played in Europe with teams in the Netherlands and Turkey.\nCoaching career.\nHopkins returned to Syracuse in 1995 and was primarily involved with recruiting and the development of guards. Hopkins played a large role in developing future NBA player Jason Hart and SU standout Allen Griffin. He has also been credited for recruiting Gerry McNamara and Billy Edelin.\nIn May 2007, it was reported that Hopkins was picked to be Jim Boeheim's successor, even though there was no timetable for Boeheim to retire. However, in October, Athletic Director Daryl Gross refuted that story, saying that his quote was taken out of context.\nAway from Syracuse, Hopkins was the Court Coach for Team USA in 1998, 2000, 2001, 2010, and 2012.\nIn March 2010, Hopkins' name surfaced in connection with the head coaching vacancy at Charlotte. Hopkins was reported to be a finalist for the Oregon State University head coaching vacancy in May 2014.\nOn June 25, 2015, Hopkins was formally named Men's Basketball Head Coach-Designate by Syracuse University.\nHopkins served as Head Coach during Jim Boeheim's controversial nine game suspension from December 5, 2015 to January 5, 2016.\nOn March 19, 2017, it was announced that Hopkins had been hired as head basketball coach at the University of Washington for the 2017–18 season. Hopkins signed a six-year deal worth $12.3 million. He will earn $1.8 million in his first year and an additional $100,000 each subsequent year of the deal.\nCoach Hopkins earned the Pac-12's Coach of the Year award in each of his first two seasons at the University of Washington, while also leading the Huskies to a regular season conference title in the 2018–19 season.\nOn March 8, 2024, the University of Washington announced that Hopkins would not be returning for the 2024–25 season. However he would finish the season with the Huskies."

This was the final year of the qualifying tournaments (except for the \"Far East\"), so it was a simple matter of the winner being promoted. This was also the final year of the traditional eight team tournament. Beginning in 2001 Group B would be renamed 'Division I' and consist of two six team divisions.\nFinal Round 17–24 Place.\n\"Germany was promoted to the 2001 IIHF World Championship. No team was relegated.\"\nWorld Championship Group C (China PR).\nPlayed March 20–26 in Beijing. In 1999 Group C was disrupted because of political issues surrounding Kosovo. The IIHF chose to have no team relegated and have Yugoslavia retain their position, the result was a nine team tournament this year. With the forthcoming realignment, four nations had the opportunity to be promoted to Division I, the remaining five would participate in next year's Division II.\nGroup 1.\n\"Hungary was promoted to Division I\"\nGroup 2.\n\"Croatia came back from a two goal deficit to tie Romania, and thereby clinch a promotion to Division I.\"\nGroup 3.\n\"China was promoted to Division I.\"\nConsolation Round 28–30 Place.\n\"Lithuania was promoted to Division I.\"\nWorld Championship Group D (Iceland).\nPlayed April 10–16 in Reykjavík.

In 1998, the team events in both genres were introduced, but at the next edition the event was dropped and the mixed teams event returned. Later in 2002, the mixed team event returned.

        "title": "Las Vegas Wranglers (baseball)",
        "text": "The Las Vegas Wranglers were a minor league baseball team that played in various leagues in the 1940s and 1950s. They were Las Vegas's first professional team in any sport.\nThe first year.\nThe Wranglers were one of the charter franchises of the Class C Sunset League in 1947. Despite Paul Zaby's league-leading .402 batting average and a historic offensive season from Calvin Felix, the Wranglers (a Boston Braves affiliate) finished just 73-67, third place, and were beaten in the semifinals by Riverside, California. Las Vegas was managed by ex-major leaguer Newt Kimball, who also won 14 games as a pitcher for the Wranglers that year.\nThe 21-year-old Felix led the Sunset League in nearly every offensive category in 1947, including 52 home runs, the second-most ever hit in a pro league by such a young player (Tony Lazzeri, also then 21, hit 60 HR for Salt Lake City in 1925, but his team played 200 games). Felix was sold to the Class AAA Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League after the season, but never played for them; instead he wound up with the unaffiliated Denver Bears of the Western League in 1948, and with Santa Barbara (a Dodgers affiliate) in 1949. By 1953, Felix was with the AAA Montreal Royals, but was sent down to the Texas League in '54; he never played in the majors. \nActor Cameron Mitchell pitched one game for the '47 Wranglers; Las Vegas, needing all the pitching help they could get in the offense-minded Sunset League, signed Mitchell after he shut out the Los Angeles Angels (PCL) for four innings in an exhibition game. But the actor was shelled, allowing eleven runs in less than an inning to the Ontario, California Orioles. \nLater years.\nLas Vegas continued to be one of the circuit's top teams the next three years. In 1948, the Wranglers moved up to second place and made to the championship series before losing to Reno. However, the team drew only around 600 fans per game (Las Vegas' population was only around 20,000 then) and faced a $15,000 deficit at season's end, partially because they were no longer affiliated with the Braves. In 1949, however, the Wranglers blew the league away with an 88-38 record and easily claimed the pennant, with attendance climbing to over 1,000 per contest. Due to budget cuts, there were no playoffs that year, and the '49 Wranglers had claimed Las Vegas' first pro sports championship (and last one for 37 years, until the Las Vegas Stars won the PCL crown in 1986). After a third-place finish in 1950, the top teams in the Sunset League merged with the Arizona–Mexico League to form the new Southwest International League in 1951.\nDeclining attendance vexed minor-league ball throughout the country in the early 1950s, and Las Vegas was no exception: despite two more winning seasons in 1951–52, the Wranglers (along with the rest of the SWIL) died after the 1952 season.\nBaseball returned to Las Vegas in 1957, but the new team (also called the Wranglers) finished fourth in the Arizona–Mexico League, then folded. On May 26, 1958, however, the San Jose Pirates of the California League shifted operations to Las Vegas, renaming themselves (once again) the Wranglers. But the team finished a poor seventh and disbanded after the season when the Cal League contracted from eight teams to six.\nLas Vegas would not have another professional baseball team for a quarter-century, until the Las Vegas Stars joined the Pacific Coast League in 1983."

        "title": "World Series of Birding",
        "text": "The World Series of Birding is an annual birding competition organised by the New Jersey Audubon Society since 1984. Participating teams compete to identify the greatest number of bird species by sight or sound in a 24-hour period. The event is run as a way of drawing attention to birding as a sport, the migration of birds, and as a fundraiser for conservation efforts. The event is primarily run within New Jersey however some parts of the competition are run internationally over the internet. \nThere are three levels of competition, each designed to accommodate teams of differing ages and expertise. \nAwards.\nThere are a series of awards offered for the Level I and Level III challenges. They each support different achievements and ways of competing. There are no awards for the Level II challenge as this is a non-competitive challenge intended for fun and raising money for the New Jersey Audubon Society.\nThe awards for the Level I challenge are only eligible for teams with all members above 19 years of age and can be won by teams competing from any area of New Jersey. The awards are as follows:\nThe awards for the Level III challenge are given based on division, which is based on school grade. They are as follows:\nNo award offered in the World Series of Birding involves a cash prize. The competition is primarily intended as an awareness and fundraising event for bird conservation. \nHistory.\nThe idea for the World Series of Birding came from Pete Dunne, one of America's foremost authors on birding and natural history, and currently the director of the Cape May Bird Observatory. The first World Series of Birding was held on May 19, 1984, and the winning team included Dunne, David Sibley (author of the renowned The Sibley Guide to Birds), the late Pete Bacinski (former director of NJ Audubon's Owl Haven Nature Center and Sandy Hook Bird Observatory), Bill Boyle (author of \"A Guide to Bird Finding in New Jersey\"), and the legendary Roger Tory Peterson (inventor of the modern field guide) and was sponsored by Bird Watcher's Digest. Their total included 201 species, including a fork-tailed flycatcher—a tropical species rarely seen anywhere in the United States, let alone New Jersey.\nSince the first competition, the World Series has been held annually on a date between May 9 and May 19, which coincides with the height of the spring bird migration through New Jersey. Winning tallies have ranged from a low of 182 species in 1985 to a high of 231 species in 2003 for the team sponsored by Nikon Sport Optics and the Delaware Valley Ornithological Club (DVOC). The event has steadily gained in popularity over the years; in 1984, 13 teams took part, compared with over 60 in 2006. Over the years, the World Series of Birding has raised more than $9,000,000 for bird conservation.\nIn 2007, filmmaker Jason Kessler released his documentary, \"Opposable Chums: Guts &amp; Glory at The World Series of Birding,\" which covered both the history and logistics of the event.\nIn 2022, Birdability’s “Team Nuthatch” became the first ever team in World Series’ history to be composed entirely of disabled birders.\nStrategies.\nMost teams that compete throughout the entire state start at midnight in the northern part of the state. During pre-daylight hours, teams often visit sites such as the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge that are home to certain kinds of owls, rails, and bitterns that are difficult to hear or see during the day. At daybreak, many teams find themselves in the far northern reaches of New Jersey attempting to find species such as purple finch and common raven that are difficult to find farther south. Between 5–10 a.m., teams often pick up the majority of the species they will see all day. Afterwards, teams typically make their way into the central and southern parts of the state to places such as the Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge at Brigantine, Cape May, and Belleplain State Forest. After dusk, teams continue to search for the nocturnal species they may have missed at the start of the day but must be at the \"finish line\" at Cape May Point State Park by midnight, or face stiff penalties.\nCrucial to the success of any serious World Series effort is scouting for species in the days and weeks prior to the event. Most teams will have staked out desirable species (often nesting birds that can be reliably found on the day of competition) in advance to minimize the time they have to spend looking for any one species in particular. Additionally, teams should maximize the number of different habitats they visit (e.g., saltwater marshes, Canadian Zone woodlands, pine forests, beaches, etc.), as different species frequent different habitats. Finally, teams should plan their route to maximize time spent birding and minimize time spent driving.\nFor more information on route planning and strategy, see Pete Dunne's \"Blueprint for a Big Day,\" the World Series of Birding Discussion Forum, and the scouting notes of the Nikon/DVOC team that has won the World Series five out of the last eight years. All can be found under External Links.\nIdentifying bird species.\nIn order for a species to be counted as identified, the bird must be found alive, wild, and unrestrained. Wild birds that are sick, injured, or oiled may also be counted. Eggs do not count as birds. Identified species are logged using the eBird online bird database platform from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. This allows teams to record written descriptions, photographs, and audio recordings of identified species. Birds must be identified by at least two team members, and 95% of all birds recorded by a team must be identified by all members of the team. Exceptions to this 95% rule apply to team members who are legally blind (who are not counted when identifying non-vocalizing birds) and members who communicate primarily through American Sign Language (who are not counted when identifying birds that are heard only). The use of online resources and apps is restricted solely to confirming identifications made by team members, thus the skill of individual birders at identifying species is important for teams to succeed in the competition.\nNumber of species identified.\nThe total number of bird species identified by each team can vary widely due to a number of factors, such as weather and atmospheric conditions, the experience and skill of team members, and the location of birding. In the past, teams competing in New Jersey have been able to identify within the range of 48 to 229 unique species, averaging 165 species. In 2020 when the competition was opened to other states along the Atlantic Flyway, the total number of unique species identified in that year's competition was 357. Since 1984, a total of 330 unique species of bird have been identified in New Jersey through the World Series of Birding."

        "title": "1928 World Snooker Championship",
        "text": "The 1928 World Snooker Championship was a professional snooker tournament held at various venues from 28 December 1927 to 17 May 1928. It was the second staging of the World Snooker Championship. It was played on a challenge basis with the other six entrants playing off for the right to challenge defending champion Joe Davis in the final. The final was held at the Camkin's Hall in Birmingham, England, with three of the other matches contested there, and one each played in Leamington Spa and Nottingham.\nDavis won 16–13 in the final against Fred Lawrence, and retained the title. Davis had won the professional billiards championship earlier in May, and became the first person to hold the professional titles in billiards and snooker titles concurrently, and then the first person to win them both in the same season. The highest of the snooker tournament was 46, compiled by Alec Mann in the third of his first round match against Albert Cope.\nBackground.\nProfessional English billiards player and billiard hall manager Joe Davis had noticed the increasing popularity of snooker compared to billiards in the 1920s, and with Birmingham-based billiard hall manager Bill Camkin, who had also seen snooker's increasing appeal, persuaded the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC) to recognise an official professional snooker championship in the 1926–27 season. The inaugural event was won by Davis, who defeated Tom Dennis 20–11 in the final. Originally called the Professional Championship of Snooker, the annual competition was not titled the World Championship until 1935, but the 1927 tournament is now referred to as the first World Snooker Championship.\nFor the 1928 championship, a qualifying competition was held to produce a challenger to Davis, the defending champion. Most of the rules of the competition were as per the previous year, except that the preliminary rounds were to be played over 23 (rather than the 15 in 1927). Entry fees would be used to provide prize money for the finalists, with 60 per cent going to the champion. As a trophy had been purchased the previous year, there was no need to deduct money from entry fees to buy one, unlike at the first staging. The venue for the semi-finals and final was to be Camkin's Hall, Birmingham, with those matches supervised by the Midland Counties Billiard Association, and the players concerned would be left to arrange the locations for earlier rounds. The entry fee was set at five guineas per player (), with a five-guineas sidestake required. The Billiards Championship had been contested on a similar basis, with qualifying matches to produce a challenger to the champion, previously, and the system continued for that competition as well, but with an entry fee of £50 for the preliminary rounds, .\nThe closing date for entries for the snooker championship was 1 November 1927. There were seven entrants: Davis, Dennis, Tom Newman, Fred Smith, Albert Cope, Alec Mann, and Fred Lawrence.\nSummary.\nThe first match played was between Tom Newman and Fred Smith at the Albert Hall, Kenilworth Street, Leamington Spa from 28 to 30 December. Newman led 7–1 after the first day and 10–6 at the end of the second day. Newman won the first two frames on the final day to secure victory at 12–6.\nAlec Mann compiled a of 46 in the third frame against Albert Cope and made a 23 break at his following visit. During that frame he conceded points from five successive shots, and more from two later fouls, finally winning the frame by 107 points to 42. The match was 2–2 at the first interval, before Mann took three of the next four to lead 5–3 after the first day. On the second day, Mann added the first four frames, with Cope subsequently recovering from 3–9 to 6–10,\nand on the third day secured the win at 12–8. The three \"dead\" frames were played, resulting in a final score of 14–9 to Mann. Mann's break of 46 was the highest made in the 1928 tournament.\nOn 16 January, the day after he had eliminated Cope, Mann's match against Fred Lawrence commenced. Mann obtained a 3–1 lead, before the first day finished at 4–4. Lawrence took a 7–5 lead, and after the players each added a further two frames, was 9–7 ahead going into the last day. After the first on the third day, Lawrence led 11–9, but Mann won the following frame, and added the almost 50-minute long 22nd frame. In the , Lawrence led by 17 points to 4, before a 21 break from Mann. Lawrence, through play and , gained penalty points conceded by Mann and won the frame with a 20 break from the to the .\nThe match between Tom Dennis and Newman was played from 29 to 31 March at The Lounge, Shakespeare Street, Nottingham. Newman took a 5–3 lead on the first day and increased this to 11–5 after two days, just one frame from victory. Newman won the first frame on the final day to take a winning 12–5 lead. The evening session was rearranged to include a billiards match as well as a frame of snooker.\nNewman and Lawrence met in Birmingham from 7 to 9 May. Lawrence led 6–2 after the first day. From 5–9, Newman won the last two frames on the second day to reduce Lawrence's lead to 9–7 but Lawrence progressed to the final against Davis by securing the first three frames on the final day to win the match 12–7.\nOn 5 May, Davis became the professional English billiards champion for the first time, defeating Newman 16,000 – 14,874, making sixty in the last professional final to be played with ivory balls. Davis thereby became the first player to hold the professional titles in both billiards and snooker, an achievement not matched until his brother Fred Davis won the billiards championship in 1980.\nFinal.\nThe final between Davis and Lawrence was played from 14 to 17 May in Camkin's Hall in Birmingham. Lawrence and Davis shared the opening four frames in the afternoon session for 2–2, but Davis won all four frames in the evening to lead 6–2 after the first day. Lawrence won three frames on the second evening but Davis still led 9–7 after two days play. Three consecutive frame victories on the third afternoon helped Davis obtain a 14–10 after the third day, needing just two frames on the final day. Lawrence won three of the four afternoon frames on the final day to reduce Davis's lead to 15–13, well in the first two frames before what the \"Birmingham Daily Gazette\" termed a \"woefully weak shot\" when he was attempting to pot the failed. Directly after this, Davis made a break of 18. Lawrence was 26 points behind after all the had been potted, and although he potted the first five of the six , left an easy opportunity on the , with Davis potting it to take the frame. Lawrence, who made a 42 break, claimed the following frame for 13–15. Lawrence led 52–14 in the first evening frame but Davis eventually won it 64–56 to retain his title by 16 frames to 13. Davis became the first player to claim both the professional billiards and snooker titles in the same season.

        "title": "1929 World Snooker Championship",
        "text": "The 1929 World Snooker Championship, known at the time as the Professional Championship of Snooker, was a snooker tournament held between 17 December 1928 and 7 March 1929 at various venues in England, with the final taking place from 4 to 7 March 1929 at the Lounge Hall, Nottingham. Defending champion Joe Davis won the title for the third time by defeating Tom Dennis by 19 to 14 in the final, after securing a winning margin at 17–12.\nIt was the third edition of the World Snooker Championship. The first round match was held at Loughborough Town Hall, and the venue for the semi-finals was Camkin's Hall, Birmingham. The highest of the tournament was 61, a new championship record, compiled by Davis in the 23rd frame of the final.\nBackground.\nProfessional English billiards player and billiard hall manager Joe Davis had noticed the increasing popularity of snooker compared to billiards in the 1920s, and with Birmingham-based billiard hall manager Bill Camkin, who had also seen snooker's increasing appeal, persuaded the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC) to recognise an official professional snooker championship in the 1926–27 season. The inaugural event was won by Davis, who defeated Tom Dennis 20–11 in the final. Originally called the Professional Championship of Snooker, the annual competition was not titled the World Championship until 1935, but the 1927 tournament is now referred to as the first World Snooker Championship.\nFor the 1928 championship, a qualifying competition had been held to produce a challenger to Davis, the defending champion. In July 1928 the BACC decided to abandon the challenge system that had been employed for both the Billiards Championship and the Professional Snooker Championship. This meant that Davis, the champion, had to play through the 1929 tournament, which was the third staging of the championship.\nThe closing date for entries for the snooker championship was 15 October 1928. The entry fee was set at five guineas per player (), with a five-guineas sidestake required for each match. Preliminary heats and the semi-finals were to be best of 25 , played over three days, with the final contested over 33 frames across four days. When the conditions for the championship were published, Camkin's Hall in Birmingham was named as the venue for the final. For pre-final matches, the players concerned were to arrange the dates and venues.\nSummary.\nFive players entered the Championship: Joe Davis (Chesterfield), Tom Dennis (Nottingham), Fred Lawrence (Birmingham), Alec Mann (Birmingham) and Kelsall Prince (Loughborough). Lawrence and Mann had to play a first round match, with the winner to meet Davis. Dennis and Prince faced each other in the other semi-final.\nThe first match played was the semi-final between Dennis and Prince. This was scheduled from 17 to 22 December 1928 at Town Hall, Loughborough, over six evening rather than across the three sets of afternoon and evening sessions envisaged when the tournament's conditions were announced. There was just one of four frames each evening, with five planned for the final day. The match was close until halfway through the fourth session with Dennis then leading 8–6. However, Dennis then took the next five frames to win the match 13–6. He added the final frame of the evening to leave the score at 14–6 after five sessions. The match did not continue to the planned sixth session and so finished on 21 December.\nThe first round match and the other semi-final were arranged for the week of 21 to 26 January 1929 at Camkin's Hall, Birmingham. The first round match was on the first three days; the winner to play Davis on the last three days. Both matches were over 25 frames with two sessions of four frames each day. After 13 frames of their match, Lawrence led Mann 10–3 but Mann won the last three frames of the day to close the gap to 10–6. On the final day, Mann continued his run of frames, winning 9 out of 10, to take a 12–11 lead. However, Lawrence won the last two frames to take the match 13–12. A columnist in the March 1929 edition of \"The Billiard Player\" magazine praised Mann's and Lawrence's play generally, but commented that \"almost atrociously bad technique\" by Mann when attempting to pot the yellow instead of playing for a in the lost him the match. The same writer also added that \"the scarcity of the London Press reports in connexion with the Professional Snooker Games ... was freely commented upon in Birmingham.\"\nIn the Birmingham semi-final, Davis obtained a 5–3 lead on the first day, maintaining a two-frame advantage at 9–7 after two days. On the final day Davis won the first two frames but Lawrence took the next two to again close the gap. On the final evening, Davis won the first frame to lead 12–9 but lost the following frame. Davis added the third frame of the evening to secure a 13–10 victory.\nFinal.\nAt the request of Davis and Dennis, the BACC agreed to change the venue and date of the final from Camkin's Hall in late March. The 33- final was played from 4 to 7 March. Eight frames were played each day, with four frames in the afternoon and four in the evening (five on the final day). The match was held at The Lounge, Shakespeare Street, Nottingham and was refereed by W. Malkinson of Nottingham. Davis led 6–2 after the first day. On the third day, the first frame featured prolonged exchanges of safety play, before a 45 break by Davis. Dennis had an opportunity to win if he completed a , but went the and left Davis an easy pot, which he made, to win the frame. The following frame saw Davis's 31 break followed by a 36 break made by Dennis, before Dennis went in-off the . Dennis's potted blue had resulted in a stroke, the blue was , and Davis potted it from , following that by potting the pink to win the frame. Dennis won the 15th frame by six points, after clearing the last three colours. He added the 16th frame, during which he escaped from a with a shot, and potted the pink after Davis had gone in-off. With the frames from the session shared, Davis retained his four frame lead at 10–6.\nOn day three, Dennis took three of the four frames in the afternoon, but Davis won three in the evening to maintain his four frame advantage. Davis compiled a 61 break in that evening session, potting nine , six and two blues in the 23rd frame. In the fourth afternoon session, on 7 March, Davis lost the first frame by one point, 56–57, despite making a break of 45. He took the next, aided by a pot of a . With each player winning a further frame, the session finished with Davis 16–12 ahead. Davis then won the first frame in the evening, with breaks of 33, 24 and 33, to claim the championship by achieving a winning margin at 17–12. The four \"dead\" frames were played, with each player winning two. The Championship Cup was afterwards presented by Tinsley Lindley. Davis's break of 61 was a new championship record, and the only break of over 50 made during the tournament. The secretary of the BACC, A. Stanley Thorn, claimed that \"the event attracted considerable interest in Nottingham, and excellent attendances were present during the four days' play.\"\nMain draw.\nResults.\nMatch results are shown below.

        "title": "Westerley Cycling Club",
        "text": "The Westerley Cycling Club is based in Ealing, West London. It was founded in 1924, and has played a prominent role in the development of time trialling in the United Kingdom.\nHistory.\nEarly.\n'The Westerley' as it is known today was originally formed as a racing subset of the Western Section of the CTC (Cyclists' Touring Club), now the Ealing section of the West London DA. This was intended to allow members of that CTC section to form a racing club without ultimately disentangling themselves from the then hugely popular CTC.\nThe \"Western Wheelers\" was therefore formed for the use of regular riding male members of the local CTC section. Women were admitted in 1927, by which point it had emerged that there was already a club named \"Western Wheelers\", and so the name \"Western Elite\" was briefly adopted, eventually becoming the \"Westerley Road Club\". The close connections to the CTC can still be seen in the club logo, which is clearly influenced by the CTC logo comprising a bicycle wheel with concentric star of three wings. The colours - purple, white and black - are those of the founding CTC section.\n1925 was the first fully active year for the Westerley Road Club, which, led by its president Will Townsend OBE (d.2007), promoted a programme of time trials. These consisted of the standard distances; 10, 25, 50 and 100 miles, as well as a 12-hour event and a hill climb.\nThe Second World War brought several casualties for the club, although it survived and returned to its previous strength during the late 1940s and early 1950s.\nMembers of the Westerley have, during the 20th Century, enjoyed considerable success in many types of racing, in particular tricycling and RRA (Road Records Association) records.\nModern.\nIn 2003, the name \"Westerley Road Club\" was updated to the \"Westerley Cycling Club\". This change denoted a response to the dwindling profile of traditional time trialling clubs in the UK. The Westerley now promotes a set of spring criterium races at the Hillingdon Cycle Circuit in West London, in addition to a reduced time trial programme.\nThe Westerley Cycling Club is affiliated to British Cycling and Cycling Time Trials.\nWesterley also organise annual Audax events from Ruislip."

        "text": "Brian David Noble MBE (born 14 February 1961), also known by the nickname of \"Nobby\", is an English rugby league coach and former rugby league footballer. As a footballer, Noble was a Great Britain representative , but is best known for his coaching career, during which he coached the Bradford Bulls, the Wigan Warriors, the Crusaders RL and the Salford Red Devils in the Super League, and the Great Britain national team. He was the first coach to win three Super League Grand Finals, and is one of only two coaches to have achieved that feat along with Brian McDermott. He was formerly the Director of Rugby for the Toronto Wolfpack, and also works as a pundit for BBC Sport.\nBackground.\nNoble was born in Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England.\nPlaying career.\nBrian Noble's early rugby league career was as a member of the Police Boys' Clubs before he signed for Bradford Northern. His début came in the 1978–79 season and was the beginning of almost 15 years and over 400 games with the club, concluding in the centenary season of 1995-96 following a spell at Wakefield Trinity (Heritage No. 1062).\nNoble combined his professional career with his job as a policeman, and captained Great Britain on the Lions' tour of Australasia in 1984. He played in all seven tests on the tour, including the test in Papua New Guinea.\nBrian Noble played in Bradford Northern's 5–10 defeat by Castleford in the 1981 Yorkshire Cup Final during the 1981–82 season at Headingley, Leeds on Saturday 3 October 1981, played in the 7–18 defeat by Hull F.C. in the 1982 Yorkshire Cup Final during the 1981–82 season at Elland Road, Leeds on Saturday 2 October 1982, played in the 12–12 draw with Castleford in the 1987 Yorkshire Cup Final during the 1987–88 season at Headingley, Leeds on Saturday 17 October 1987, played in the 11–2 victory Castleford in the 1987 Yorkshire Cup Final replay during the 1987–88 season at Elland Road, Leeds on Saturday 31 October 1987.\nBrian Noble played in Bradford Northern's 2–12 defeat by Warrington in the 1990–91 Regal Trophy Final during the 1990–91 season at Headingley, Leeds on Saturday 12 January 1991, and played (replaced by substitute Trevor Clark) in the 15–8 defeat by Wigan in the 1992–93 Regal Trophy Final during the 1992–93 season at Elland Road, Leeds on Saturday 23 January 1993.\nCoaching career.\nBradford.\nAfter 6 years serving in the backroom staff at the club following his retirement, he was appointed Bradford head coach in November 2000. After initial confusion regarding chairman Chris Caisley's appointment - the tabloids reported that the new coach was Radio 4 comedian Ross Noble! - he was a hugely popular choice to succeed departing coach Matthew Elliott. Noble took Bradford Bulls to the 2001 Super League Grand Final in which they defeated Wigan. As Super League VI champions, Bradford played against 2001 NRL Premiers, the Newcastle Knights in the 2002 World Club Challenge. Noble oversaw Bradford's victory. In July 2002, Noble received an honorary doctorate from the University of Bradford for his achievements as a rugby league footballer, and coach. He took Bradford to the 2002 Super League Grand Final which was lost to St. Helens. He was named Super League coach of the year in 2003 and succeeded David Waite as Great Britain coach following the 2003 Ashes series. Noble took Bradford to the Grand Final again in 2004 but lost out to local rivals Leeds Rhinos 16–8 at Old Trafford. Noble led Bradford to victory in the 2005 Super League Grand Final his third Championship in five years with the club. Noble left Bradford midway through the 2006 season to join Wigan, handing control to his assistant Steve McNamara.\nWhile head coach of the Bradford Bulls, Noble guided them to two Minor Premiership titles, victory in three Grand Finals in 2001, 2003 and 2005, victory in the Challenge Cup in 2003 and to three World Club Championships in 2002, 2004 and 2006. In 2004 he received the Rugby League International Federation's coach of the year award.\nWigan.\nOn 20 April 2006 Noble took up the position of head coach at Wigan, nine days after the sacking of Ian Millward. Brian took over at the club during a relegation battle which at one point looked as though Wigan would lose, however he has been credited for keeping Wigan in Super League following a number of impressive performance. However, despite having just £60,000 available to spend under the salary cap, Noble bought Stuart Fielden and Michael Dobson from the Bradford Bulls for a world record £450,000. At the end of the season when the club's books were audited by the league's accountants, it was found there was an unauthorised overspend of £222,314, which led to allegations that the club cheated their way out of relegation by deliberately spending money they didn't have due to salary cap restrictions. However the club was eventually only found guilty of \"breaching the spirit of the cap\", by trying to restructure existing contracts.\nOn 17 January 2007 it was announced that his contract as head coach of the British national team would not be renewed.\nIn October 2009, after the defeat by St Helens in the semifinal play-off game, Noble announced he would be leaving to club.\nCrusaders RL.\nOn 14 October 2009 Noble was confirmed as the new head coach of the Welsh side Crusaders. Jon Sharp was first-team coach, and Iestyn Harris was an assistant. In the 2010 season Noble managed to gain 13 wins, which was a vast improvement on the season before, and took them into the playoffs for the first time.\nIn November 2010, Noble confirmed his departure from Crusaders Rugby League after only one season in charge. His last match as Head Coach was an 18–12 loss away to Huddersfield in an Elimination Play-off tie.\nSalford.\nOn 13 April 2013 Noble was appointed head coach of Salford on an 18-month contract, but on 4 April 2014, Marwan Koukash announced that Noble would become the director of football at Salford, while Noble's former assistant Iestyn Harris would become the new head coach. He departed the club soon after.\nOther positions.\nFollowing his departure from Salford, Noble worked in a part-time consultancy basis with London Broncos and Gloucestershire All Golds, while regularly appearing as a pundit and occasionally as a co-commentator on BBC Sport's rugby league coverage.\nHonours.\nNoble was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to rugby league and charity."

        "title": "Jonathan Kaplan (rugby union)",
        "text": "Jonathan Isaac Kaplan (born 7 November 1966 in Durban, South Africa), is a former international rugby union referee who used to hold the record for the most international matches as referee.\nHe announced his retirement on 26 October 2013 and took charge of the 2013 Currie Cup Final between and the as his final domestic league match as referee. His final test match as a referee was on 16 November 2013 when he took charge of the Namibia v Kenya match in the final fixture of the 2013 Namibian Tri-Nations in Windhoek.\nBackground.\nKaplan was born in Durban to Jewish parents, and was educated at Carmel College, Durban, and King David School, Linksfield, Johannesburg. He gained a bachelor of social sciences degree, with majors in economics and psychology, from the University of Cape Town and a postgraduate degree in marketing management from the University of South Africa.\nRefereeing career.\nKaplan began refereeing in 1984, while still a high school student. He made his first-class debut in 1991 and was appointed to South Africa's national panel of referees in 1993. On 4 May 1996 he made his international debut in a match between Namibia and Zimbabwe in Harare.\nHe was appointed as a touch judge for the 1999 Rugby World Cup, and as a referee for the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia, where he took charge of three pool games and the quarter-final between France and Ireland. He was one of the twelve referees appointed to officiate at the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France, and took charge of four pool games and the semi-final between England and France, and also at the 2011 Rugby World Cup where he refereed Tonga v Canada, Canada v Japan, England v Georgia &amp; Ireland v Italy, he was also an Assistant Referee in the Semi-final between Wales &amp; France. Jonathan become the first South African to officiate at four World Cups, and referee at three.\nSome of Kaplan's other notable games in charge include the first ever game in the Six Nations Championship, between Italy and Scotland in 2000, the second test between the British &amp; Irish Lions and Australia in 2001 and the third test between the Lions and New Zealand in 2005.\nKaplan was the referee for the 2005 Super 12 final and the 2006 Super 14 final (a game notorious for the dense fog which obscured much of the action from spectators and commentators). In December 2008 he was chosen as one of nine referees on a merit panel who, it was intended, would between them have charge of 75% of 2009 Super 14 matches irrespective of the nationality of the teams involved. In line with this policy, Kaplan was appointed to referee the 2009 Super 14 Final; in previous years he would have been debarred from officiating because of the involvement of a South African team. In late 2009, he was again named on the merit panel for the 2010 Super 14.\nIn October 2008 he took charge of the final of South Africa's premier domestic competition, the Currie Cup, for the fourth time, and was the referee again for the 2009 final.\nOn 12 February 2013, Kaplan announced his retirement from refereeing as of the end of the season.\nRecords.\nKaplan was previously the most experienced Test referee of all time: he became the first referee to reach the milestone of 50 Test matches when he refereed the Scotland-Ireland game during the 2009 Six Nations Championship, and has since increased his total to 70 Tests (as at his retirement). The record is now 100, held by Nigel Owens.\nHe also holds the record for refereeing the most Tests involving a single team: the New Zealand-Wales game in June 2010 was his 17th involving the host nation (ending up in 18), surpassing the record of 16 matches previously held jointly by Welshman Derek Bevan (also refereeing New Zealand) and New Zealander Paul Honiss (refereeing Australia).\nOther refereeing records held by Kaplan are: most Bledisloe Cup matches (8); most Tri Nations matches (8); most Six Nations matches (18); only referee to have participated in four British &amp; Irish Lions tours and to have had charge of matches in all three tour countries (Free State v B&amp;I Lions, South Africa 1997; 2nd Test, Australia 2001; 3rd Test, New Zealand 2005; Sharks v B&amp;I Lions, South Africa 2009).\nKaplan also holds South African refereeing records for most Rugby World Cup appearances (4: 1999 (as a touch judge), 2003, 2007, 2011) and most World Cup games (13 – 5 as a touch judge) most Super 14 games (107, including 3 finals and 4 semi-finals); and most Currie Cup matches (161, including 6 finals and 4 semi-finals); and is the only referee to have won the award as South African Referee of the Year for four years in succession (2003–07)and 5 overall."

        "title": "Split in darts",
        "text": "The split in darts refers to the acrimonious 1993 dispute between professional darts players and the game's governing body, the British Darts Organisation (BDO), resulting in the creation of a rival darts circuit under the banner of the World Darts Council, which eventually became the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC).\nDarts had boomed as a televised sport in Britain the 1980s, and the resulting influx of sponsorship and prize money allowed many players to turn professional. But by the end of the decade, television coverage had dropped to just one tournament. In 1993, 16 top players, disillusioned by the BDO's running of the sport and what they saw as its inability to reverse the decline in television coverage and sponsorship, left the BDO to run their own tournaments as the World Darts Council (WDC).\nThe BDO responded by imposing a worldwide ban on the rebel players and anyone who associated with them. A costly four year legal battle ensued, culminating in a compromise Tomlin Order in 1997. The BDO lifted the ban and formally recognised the WDC and the right of players to freely participate in darts competitions. In return, the WDC dropped its claim to being a world governing body and renamed itself the Professional Darts Corporation. Thereafter, each organisation had its own pool of players and tournaments, and each staged its own version of the World Professional Darts Championship.\nThe BDO folded into administration in October 2020 and the World Darts Federation took over control of BDO events, so the split in darts remains. The WDF subsequently established its own version of the World Darts Championship and the inaugural event took place in 2022.\nBackground.\nThe darts boom.\nThe British Darts Organisation (BDO) was formed in 1973 by Olly Croft. It gradually superseded the existing National Darts Association of Great Britain (NDAGB) as the governing body of darts in the UK and by the early 1980s had established a monopoly on organised darts in Britain, running super league darts, county darts and major tournaments, including the annual World Championship. The BDO became a founder member of the World Darts Federation in 1974. The BDO would preside over darts' rise from a pub game to a worldwide sport.\nDarts first appeared on British television in May 1937 when the BBC broadcast a darts and shove ha'penny competition from Alexandra Palace. In 1962, Westward Television broadcast the Westward TV Invitational to the south-west of England. In 1972, ITV started broadcasting the News of the World Championship. ITV producer Donald Baverstock stated:\n\"Twelve thousand darts fans turn up at the Ally Pally drunk as skunks. They cheer on their heroes just like a football crowd. They have banners, gonks, rattles, the lot. It will be great telly.\"\nThe following year, ITV commissioned \"The Indoor League\", a series presented by Fred Trueman and produced by Sid Waddell which showcased various indoor sports and games; one of its features was a darts tournament involving some of the world's best players. Initially only shown in the Yorkshire Television region, it was broadcast throughout Britain on the ITV network from the second series onwards. Its venue, the Leeds Irish Centre, was recognised in 2010 as \"the birthplace of TV darts\".\nTelevised darts proliferated during the 1970s and 1980s. ITV began covering the new World Masters in 1974. The BBC soon followed suit; its first event was the British Open in 1975. Then, in 1978, the BBC picked up the inaugural World Professional Darts Championship, in part because it was \"a cheap way to fill the schedules at a time of year when the rest of the sporting programme was decimated by weather.\" Other major events which emerged included the MFI World Matchplay and MFI World Pairs, the BDO Gold Cup, the British Professional Championship, the Butlins Grand Masters and the World Cup.\nBy 1983, there were 23 televised events. In that year's world final, Keith Deller, a qualifier and 66/1 tournament outsider, defeated the heavily-favoured Eric Bristow 6–5 in an epic match. Described as the sport's zenith in its first boom period, it was watched by a Saturday afternoon audience of 8.3 million, a record for a darts match. Darts was also the centrepiece of a new gameshow, \"Bullseye\", which aired from 1981 to 1995 and attracted audiences of 20 million at its peak; virtually every darts player of note would appear on the show. Players like Eric Bristow, Jocky Wilson, John Lowe and Bobby George became household names. The abundance of prize money, sponsorship and television coverage, and with it the increased demand for exhibitions, meant that many top players were able to become full-time professionals.\nDecline.\nDarts players smoked and drank alcohol on stage, a reflection of the game's origins in pubs. In 1980, this was mocked in a sketch on the satirical BBC comedy show \"Not the Nine O'Clock News\". The sketch features a match between two overweight darts players, played by Griff Rhys Jones and Mel Smith, but instead of throwing darts, they take turns drinking shots of alcohol while a Geordie commentator (voiced by Rowan Atkinson) narrates the action (\"single pint... double vodka...\") as they get progressively more drunk. The sketch is often blamed for damaging darts' public image and reducing it to a laughing stock. Eric Bristow felt it \"didn't do the sport any favours, especially with the media luvvies who ruled the BBC and the other channels.\" According to darts historian Patrick Chaplin, it \"indelibly seared the 'fat belly' image of darts players into the minds of the nation forever.\"\nIn 1984, the British Gold Cup (BBC), Butlins Grand Masters (ATV) and British Matchplay (ITV) were all dropped from television schedules. A bigger blow came in September 1985 when ITV cancelled its long-running \"World of Sport\", which had shown darts on a regular basis. However, 1988 was \"cataclysmic\" for the sport. At the start of the year there were still 14 televised events, but then the BBC decided to cut down on \"minority\" sports like darts and consequently reduced its darts coverage to just one tournament. Then, shortly afterwards, ITV cancelled all of its darts coverage, which had included the World Masters and the World Matchplay. Tournaments shown on ITV regional channels were dropped too. The only televised event that remained by 1989 was the Embassy World Championship. John Lowe called this \"the darts world’s equivalent of the Wall Street crash.\"\nSid Waddell said \"it was the yuppie era that did for us.\" He added: \"they [television executives] thought the audience was all Cs, Ds and Es, all yobs.\" Darts had not lost viewers, but Greg Dyke, ITV's director of programmes, wanted to attract younger and more affluent audiences to the channel. He associated darts with older people and lower income groups, saying: \"It's all about image. Young viewers are just not interested.\" Alan Yentob, who became controller of BBC2 in 1987, had a similar negative view of darts.\nWhile the decline of television coverage was partly due to policy changes at the BBC and ITV, the BDO were also blamed for allowing the game to stagnate and not doing enough to improve its image. Dick Allix, manager of Eric Bristow, said \"If the BDO wants to accept the accolades of success, it must accept the responsibiity of failure.\" The BDO banned smoking on stage during matches in 1988, which was followed soon afterwards by a ban on alcohol. However, it had little impact and more televised darts did not materialise. As Bobby George put it: \"It made no difference at all to the fading interest in the game... They [the BDO] thought if beer and fags were banned, everything in the garden would be rosy again, but that didn't turn out to be the case.\"\nPlayers' unrest.\nSeveral players had longstanding grievances with the BDO and its running of darts, such as why players had no say in how events were run and why players lost money when they played in international matches. Players were not allowed to wear personal sponsors when playing in competitions, but had to promote the BDO's sponsors. John Lowe noted that he was obliged to advertise Winmau, a BDO sponsor, on his shirts for free even though he was sponsored by Unicorn, a competitor of Winmau. Eric Bristow argued that the players did not receive a fair share of the money now coming into the game, and that while the BDO excelled at bringing through amateur players, it was ill-equipped to support the top-32 professionals. When told by Olly Croft that \"the BDO put you where you are today\", Lowe replied: \"Have you ever considered that I and the other professionals all helped to put the BDO where they are today?\" Meetings were held in which the players aired their concerns, but little changed.\nHowever, there was no serious player unrest until darts' popularity started to wane in the mid-1980s. As major tournaments disappeared, this meant reduced prize money, sponsorship and television exposure, which in turn led to fewer bookings for exhibition matches. Players who had become full-time professionals during the boom years were no longer able to make a living from the sport and began to voice their concerns. They felt that not enough was being done by the BDO to encourage new sponsors and increase television coverage from more than one event per year. Rod Harrington summarised the players' issue: \"The trouble with the BDO is that, after the world championships and its great prize money, there is virtually nothing. The top players simply can't earn a living on one event.\"\nCroft himself also received criticism. Some players and managers resented the level of control he and the BDO had over darts; his attitude was variously described as \"dictatorial\" or \"autocratic\". In response to player concerns, Croft said: \"It’s like your children. They say: ‘can I have an ice cream?’ and you say: ‘no’. We don’t owe anyone a living.\"\nAnother issue arose shortly after the 1992 World Championship, when the BDO and the BBC released a VHS videotape featuring extended highlights of that year's world final between Phil Taylor and Mike Gregory. It also included highlights of the 1983, 1985 and 1987 World Championship finals involving Eric Bristow, John Lowe and Keith Deller, and Paul Lim's 9-dart finish at the 1990 World Championship. Neither the players, nor their representatives, were consulted in advance or offered payment; the BDO argued that the players had signed over all their rights and so were not entitled to notice or payment.\nIn December 1986, the Professional Dart Players Association (PDPA) was formed to represent the players, but the BDO refused to recognise the body. In August 1988, a pressure group named the Darts Council was formed by a group of players and their agents. In January 1992, 16 professional players, including every previous BDO World Champion who was still active, created their own darts organisation named the World Darts Council (WDC). They wanted to appoint a public relations consultant to improve the image of the game and to get more tournaments on television. The WDC staged their first televised event in October 1992 (the \"Lada UK Masters\" on Anglia Television).\nAccording to Bristow, he approached Croft on behalf of the WDC players shortly before the 1993 Embassy World Championship to air the players' concerns.\nThe 1993 World Championship.\nThe 1993 Embassy World Championship was the last time that all the players played in one unified world darts championship. The WDC players wore their new insignia on their sleeves during the tournament, but were told to remove them by the BDO. The WDC players decided that if they were not going to be recognised by the BDO they would no longer play in the Embassy tournament. The BDO did not allow the WDC players to set up their own tournaments and the players decided to go their own way.\nOn 7 January 1993, the 16 WDC players released a statement saying that they would only participate in the 1994 Embassy World Championship if it came under the auspices of the WDC, and that they only recognised the WDC as having the authority to sanction their participation in darts tournaments worldwide. On 24 January 1993, a couple of weeks after the 1993 Embassy World Championship had ended, the BDO responded by suspending the 16 \"rebel\" players from all BDO tournaments on British soil.\nThe 16 WDC players who signed the 7 January 1993 statement were:\nThe list included every previous world darts champion, with the exception of Leighton Rees, the first world champion from 1978, who was not an active player when the split happened.\nWorldwide ban.\nBDO and WDF sanctions.\nOn 25 April 1993, at a meeting in Finchley, the BDO took the step of turning the suspension of the WDC players from playing in any BDO-run tournaments on British soil, into a full-scale ban on the WDC players from being able to play any BDO-sanctioned darts, even down to county level. The BDO also passed a motion which said that any BDO players who participated in exhibition events with WDC players, would also be banned from the BDO. The BDO passed the following motions at the 25 April 1993 Finchley meeting:\nOn 18 October 1993, at a WDF meeting in Las Vegas, the BDO sought to have their bans on the WDC players officially ratified and set in stone on a world scale in the WDF rules, and the Welsh WDF representative moved the motion that the WDC players be referred to as the \"former top players\". The motion passed by 24 votes for to 3 votes against.\nTwo countries who voted against the motion at the Las Vegas meeting, the USA and Canada, were the only two countries whose WDF affiliates refused to sanction the ban even after the vote, saying that what they were being asked to do was against their countries' constitutions, and would therefore be breaking the law. The WDC took advantage of this to invite 7 American darts players to play in the 1994 WDC World Darts Championship.\nPlayer ban.\nThe ban on the WDC players was enforced rigorously. According to Sid Waddell, \"The BDO's use of the phrase 'associating with' WDC people had become a licence for every little witch-finder in every nook and cranny of their organisation. Whatever Croft and his allies in Muswell Hill intended, between the Finchley meeting in spring 1993 and the pre-court case proceedings in 1997 some terrible things were being reported.\" Pub teams were warned they faced a ban from competitions if their pubs hosted exhibitions by the rebel players; Phil Taylor's cousin, a Staffordshire county player, was warned not to associate with him; some officials lost their jobs after taking part in WDC events. WDC players were prevented from playing county matches. One zealous BDO official tried to document members of the audience at a Rod Harrington exhibition so they could be banned.\"\nPaul Lim was banned from WDF events after joining the WDC in 1994. Kevin Burrows, a semi-professional player who qualified for the WDC's inaugural 1994 World Championship was blacklisted from all levels of BDO darts for participating in the rebel tournament. In 1997, Richie Burnett, John Part and Alan Evans all received a ban from BDO competitions for playing in a special \"Battle of the Champions\" event broadcast on Sky Sports against WDC players Phil Taylor, Dennis Priestley and Eric Bristow. Waddell himself, who was sympathetic to the WDC players and helped them set up some of their early tournaments, recalled being treated \"like a pariah\" at the 1994 BDO world championship.\nHowever, the ban was not enforced universally and was not applied at all in America and Canada, whose WDF delegates had voted against banning the WDC players. Shayne Burgess, who joined the WDC in 1994, claimed \"the Canadians didn't give a toss about the split\" and let him play in the Canadian Open. An exception was also made for the revived News of the World Championship, held from 1996–97. As the tournament was independently run with no official WDC or BDO involvement, players were advised that they could participate in the event without penalty. Ultimately, the final was contested by a WDC representative (Phil Taylor) and a BDO representative (Ian White).\nThe rebels.\nAfter the worldwide ban was imposed, the sixteen WDC players were \"cast into the darting wilderness, able to play only amongst themselves, their future uncertain.\" Banned from the Embassy World Championship, they resolved to stage their own version. Moreover, the emergence of satellite television gave them a new option: Sky Sports, who had recently purchased the broadcast rights to English football's new Premier League. In 1993, Sky and the WDC announced an exclusive deal to broadcast the WDC World Championship, to be held in December 1993 at the Circus Tavern in Purfleet, and a new World Matchplay event which would take place in 1994. Lager manufacturer Skol would sponsor both events. Other new events were also established and shown in different ITV regions: the UK Masters (Anglia Television), the UK Matchplay (Yorkshire Television) and the Samson Classic (Tyne Tees Television).\nBut there was trouble ahead for the rebels. Chris Johns decided to return to the BDO to play in a Welsh international match before the Sky deal was announced. Then, in November 1993, just weeks before the WDC world championship was due to start, Mike Gregory also had a change of heart and returned to the BDO. John Lowe felt that Gregory had succumbed to pressure from Olly Croft, who warned that he would lose his house if the WDC lost its case. Eric Bristow wrote in his autobiography: \"Mike's decision to leave hurt us badly because he was a good player and the good players really did need to show solidarity. When he defected back to the BDO we were down to fourteen and panic was setting in.\" Gregory's defection also threatened the WDC's deal with Sky Sports, as the contract stipulated that all WDC players were to participate in the World Championship. Ultimately, Sky agreed to honour the deal, on condition that no other players withdrew from the tournament.\nDespite continued pressure and rumours of further defections, the remaining 14 players held firm and the 1994 WDC World Championship went ahead. Besides the 14 rebels, it featured two more English players willing to defy the BDO sanctions, Graeme Stoddart and Kevin Burrows, Irishman Tom Kirby and seven Americans. The latter were invited after the American WDF delegates voted against the worldwide ban and refused to implement it. The 1994 BDO World Championship took place with a largely unknown field, including 17 debutants, although Bobby George produced a resurgent performance to reach the final. The BDO event kept its contract with the BBC and began to bring through a new generation of players.\nLegal action and Tomlin Order.\nAfter the worldwide ban was imposed, the WDC sued the BDO for lost earnings and restraint of trade. They argued that the BDO enjoyed an unfair monopoly on organising events, and that the BDO's actions were \"unlawful [and] imposed unfairly, in breach of the BDO's own rules\". They further argued that the ban violated European Union law. They also cited as a precedent Tony Greig and John Snow's case against the International Cricket Council over the breakaway World Series Cricket in the 1970s. The two sides would spend over £300,000 on legal fees. At one point, Dick Allix had to arrange an emergency £20,000 loan to cover legal fees. John Raby, Tommy Cox and the players themselves all contributed their own money towards the legal expenses.\nOn 30 June 1997, days before the case reached the High Court, the BDO and the WDC representatives reached a compromise in the form of a Tomlin order. \"The Guardian\" summarized: \"the BDO lost its case\". The judge agreed that the right of the WDC players to carry out of their profession as darts players had been unreasonably restricted. The BDO lifted the worldwide ban on the WDC players, recognized the WDC and its right to stage professional competitions, and agreed that all players could freely participate in tournaments and exhibitions. In return, the WDC dropped their damages claim for loss of earnings and agreed to remove the word 'world' from their name, renaming themselves the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC). The PDC recognized the WDF as the governing body for darts worldwide, and the BDO the governing body for darts in the UK.\nSpeaking afterwards, Eric Bristow called it \"a great day for the sport of darts\". He added, \"for the first time in four years I am free to play darts in competitions all over the world... this action was never about money but our freedom to play who we liked on a local or international level, and where we liked.\" Olly Croft said he was \"not disappointed\" by the result. He confirmed there would continue to be two world championships, but \"our champion will be champion of half a million players throughout the world. Theirs will be champion of 20-odd.\"\nPlayer eligibility.\nAfter the Tomlin Order, all darts players were eligible to enter any darts competition run by the PDC, the BDO or the WDF. From 1998-2001, some BDO-affiliated players competed in the PDC's World Matchplay and World Grand Prix, and some PDC players entered the BDO's World Masters. However, no player could compete in both versions of the world championship in the same season and players who reached the last-16 of the world championship could not play in the rival event the following season. Players who accumulated enough ranking points to qualify for both world championships could choose which one to play in.\nTo play in a BDO / WDF tournament, a player had to agree to comply with the rules of the 1997 Tomlin Order and remain eligible for the BDO World Masters and World Championship, which effectively meant not become a member of the PDPA. Players therefore usually had to choose whether to be affiliated to the PDC or the BDO and stay within the jurisdiction of that organisation. Players who reached the semi-finals of the BDO world championship were contractually obliged to appear at the event the following year. This condition was later violated when Raymond van Barneveld joined the PDC in 2006 shortly after appearing in the BDO world final. Mervyn King and Jelle Klaasen did the same in 2007, leading to threats of legal action by the BDO, and subsequently Ted Hankey followed suit in 2012.\nIn 2001, the PDC offered all Professional Dart Players Association (PDPA) members a one-year contract to appear in the PDC's three televised major tournaments at the time: the World Championship, the World Matchplay and the World Grand Prix. Players who rejected the contract in order to compete in a different tournament would not be eligible to play in the remaining majors that year. It effectively meant that players who wished to play in the Matchplay and the Grand Prix would also have to commit to playing in the PDC World Championship rather than the BDO version. However, any player could apply for PDPA membership, and there would be no restrictions on entering other PDC events. Entry to most PDC majors is now restricted to members of the PDPA.\nHowever, there are notable exceptions. PDPA Players Championships and Open events often allowed residents of the host country to participate regardless of being a PDPA member or not. This leads to anomalies such as Michael van Gerwen winning the PDC Open Holland in 2006 whilst being a BDO player at the time.\nAnother exception is made for major Dutch televised tournaments. They were previously staged under BDO / WDF qualification rules, but when the most famous Dutch player Raymond van Barneveld switched to the PDC, the tournament organisers insisted on inviting PDC players. An agreement was made with the BDO to allow a number of PDC wildcards for each event. Three more top Dutch players joined the PDC in January 2007 which added more confusion to player eligibility rules for these events. (see International Darts League and World Darts Trophy)\nThe Grand Slam of Darts (organised by the PDC) was the first major tournament staged in the United Kingdom to feature players from both sides of the darting divide. Inaugurated in 2007 it also featured a return to darts broadcasting for ITV and in 2008 was broadcast exclusively live on ITV4. Players who reached the latter stages of all the major PDC and BDO tournaments over a two-year period were invited, and all but one (the then BDO World Champion Martin Adams) accepted the invitation until 2015. Phil Taylor won the competition in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2011. BDO member Scott Waites won the title in 2010.\nStanding of organisations.\nEarly years.\nThe first WDC world championship in 1994 featured most of the top ranked darts players, including seven former world champions. Paul Haigh of the \"Sunday Telegraph\" wrote: \"All the current top men except [Mike] Gregory... are WDC and there's no getting away from that fact.\" \"The Independent\" agreed: \"though the [BDO] event has much the greater pool of competitors, it is the [WDC event] which involves just about every darts player you have ever heard of.\" However, some of these players, such as Jocky Wilson and Eric Bristow, were considered past their prime by the 1990s. Olly Croft insisted that most of the WDC players were \"has beens\", though in response John Lowe pointed out that he had been world champion in 1993.\nAs BDO and PDC-affiliated players only faced each other infrequently, the strength and standing of the two organisations was ambiguous. Both organisations continued to claim that their world championship was the best version. The PDC was generally felt to have the best players,\nbut prior to the end of the legal action in June 1997, few players were willing to defy BDO sanctions and play in WDC events, so they had to make up the numbers in their early tournaments with American players of varying quality and experience. The BDO boasted a much larger worldwide pool of players and also ran women's and amateur events. The BDO world championship was the older and more established event and as it was still shown on BBC, it could reach a wider audience than the Sky-televised PDC event.\nDan Waddell wrote: \"for a number of years after the split and beyond, the issue of which code was the strongest and which World Championship was best was a source of passionate debate among darts and sports fans. In those first WDC worlds, there is no doubt they had the finer, more talented top eight, most of whom would have been seeded in a unified game. But where the BDO had the edge was in depth of talent: players who had qualified for the Embassy and were excellent performers in county and international darts, who made the tournament tougher than the WDC equivalent for the higher seeds\". Ned Boulting also thought there was \"genuine parity\" between the codes for the first decade after the split, noting that while the PDC had some outstanding players, it lacked strength in numbers.\nPDC vs BDO.\nPhil Taylor was generally regarded as the best player across both organisations in the 1990s and 2000s, and by some as the greatest darts player ever. In a special \"Battle of the Champions\" event in 1997, Taylor beat Richie Burnett, the 1995 BDO champion, 4–1 in sets. The same card featured a match between the respective 1994 champions, Dennis Priestley (PDC) and John Part (BDO). Priestley won 3–0 in sets. In a 1999 face-off dubbed \"the match of the century\", Taylor defeated Raymond van Barneveld, the 1998 and 1999 BDO champion, 21–10 in legs. In 2004, Taylor defeated Andy Fordham, the reigning BDO champion, in another challenge match broadcast on Sky Sports pay-per-view.\nIn 2005, Taylor and van Barneveld, both reigning world champions, met again in the cross-code Masters of Darts semi-finals; Taylor won 5–2 in sets. In the group stages of the same event, Taylor also beat Tony David, the 2002 BDO champion, 4–0 in sets, and beat Fordham 7–1 in the final. In 2006 and 2007, PDC players were invited to the BDO/WDF-run World Darts Trophy. Taylor won the 2006 event and lost in the 2007 final to Gary Anderson. At the 2007 International Darts League, Martin Adams, the reigning BDO champion, lost 6–2 to Adrian Lewis. The event was won by Anderson, who beat two players ranked in the PDC's top 12 en route.\nThe PDC's Grand Slam of Darts, established in 2007, was the first major darts tournament held in Britain to feature players from both the PDC and BDO. In the 2008 event Mark Webster, the reigning BDO champion, defeated PDC World Champion John Part 10–2 in legs in their second round match. The BDO's Scott Waites won the 2010 event and was runner-up to Taylor in the 2009 event. Waites was the only BDO representative to reach the Grand Slam final. When Waites played in the 2016 edition as reigning BDO champion, he lost all three group matches.\nPlayers who moved from the BDO to the PDC enjoyed varied fortunes. In 2003, John Part, the 1994 BDO world champion, won the PDC world championship with a 7–6 final victory over Taylor, becoming the first player to win both versions of the world title after the split. Raymond van Barneveld became the second in 2007. Glen Durrant, three-time BDO world champion, won the Premier League in 2020. 2014 BDO world champion, Stephen Bunting, won the PDC Masters in 2024. However, other former Lakeside champions who switched codes had less success: Richie Burnett, Steve Beaton, Jelle Klaasen, Mark Webster, Christian Kist, Scott Mitchell and Ted Hankey all failed to win a major event in the PDC.\nWidening gap and defections.\nIn 2001, Barry Hearn became PDC chairman. Under Hearn's management, the PDC Pro Tour was established, and major televised tournaments such as the UK Open, the Las Vegas Desert Classic, the Grand Slam of Darts, the Masters and the Premier League were added to the circuit. Total prizemoney increased from £500,000 per year in 2001 to over £10 million per year in 2021. In 2002, the PDC world championship overtook the BDO event as the richest darts tournament in the world. By 2015, the PDC's world championship prize fund was £1.25 million, with £250,000 for the winner, compared with the BDO event's total prize fund of £339,000 with £100,000 for the winner. Hearn also introduced new eligibility rules, effectively meaning that players wishing to play in most major PDC events had to switch to the PDC.\nConsequently, a large number of the BDO's top players, including most of its former champions, \"defected\" to the PDC, sometimes in contentious circumstances. John Part joined the PDC in 1997, becoming the first world champion after the split to switch codes. In 2001, six prominent BDO players, among them 1996 champion Steve Beaton, announced they would be playing in the PDC version of the world championship that year. In 2006, in what was described as a \"massive coup\", Raymond van Barneveld moved to the PDC. Van Barneveld said he was switching for the challenge and to \"compete against the best players in the world, including the best, Phil Taylor.\" In 2007, another three top Dutch players - Jelle Klaasen, Michael van Gerwen and Vincent van der Voort - moved to the PDC. By 2015, the BDO was described as \"mostly an unwilling feeder to the PDC: most of its biggest stars... jump ship given the chance.\" In January 2019, Glen Durrant switched to the PDC, shortly after winning his third consecutive BDO World Championship.\nMeanwhile, the BDO stagnated and began to lose ground to the PDC; annual profits stood at £16,929 in 2008, compared with over £1 million for the PDC. They were the subject of a failed takeover bid by the PDC in 2009. In 2011, the BDO board were criticized by the membership in an open letter for lagging behind the PDC in terms of sponsorship, television coverage and new ideas. Its perceived lower standard of play was also the subject of derision from some quarters. In 2016, the BBC ended its coverage of the BDO World Championship, replacing it with a new PDC tournament, the Champions League of Darts.\nDan Waddell wrote in 2016:\nThe Great Darts War is now over. The PDC stands victorious. Their \"brand\" sells out arenas designed to host stadium-swallowing rock bands, they have the best players in the world under their banner and quickly attract the best newcomers from across the divide who see a chance to make money on the professional circuit. The BDO continues to do a fine job promoting amateur darts, but its professional game is lacklustre, kept afloat only by Bob Potter's largesse and some half-hearted BBC TV coverage. It's a dated, muted relic of the vibrant, raucous tournament it once was. The BDO try to offer their professionals and top-end players tournaments and opportunities to compete, but even they know the game is up and that the flow of talent to the PDC is a tide that can't be turned. \nPDC bid to take over BDO.\nOn 21 October 2009, Barry Hearn made a bid of £1 million to purchase the BDO. The offer included a further £1 million for grassroots darts. It was the first time that a formal offer had been made public to end the 17-year split between the two organisations. However, later in the day, BDO founder Olly Croft rejected the proposal. A few months after the takeover offer and in the aftermath of the two organisations' 2010 World Championships, it was revealed and understood that the county organisations had asked the BDO board to consider the offer more seriously.\nBDO lifting of PDC restrictions.\nOn 23 August 2018, under new chairman Des Jacklin, the BDO made the decision to modify their eligibility rules. All PDC tour card holders were now permitted to enter BDO events, with the rule changes coming into effect on 1 October of the same year. The decision was made to allow female players to enter the PDC Ladies play-offs (for two spots in the PDC World Championship) without the loss of status in the BDO. This rule change also allows all players that compete in the BDO to enter the PDC Q-School without penalty. The PDPA still retains all streaming/television restrictions on PDPA tour card holders in non-PDC sanctioned events."

        "text": "James Norman Riley (May 25, 1895 – May 25, 1969) was a Canadian professional ice hockey and baseball player. The only person to play in both the National Hockey League (NHL) and Major League Baseball (MLB), Riley played nine games in the NHL in 1926–27 and six games in MLB between 1921 and 1923. In hockey he also played eight seasons in the Pacific Coast Hockey Association, a rival major league of the NHL, in a career that lased from 1915 to 1929. While in the PCHA he mainly played for the Seattle Metropolitans, and won the Stanley Cup in 1917. Riley's baseball career lasted 12 seasons from 1921 to 1932, and was mainly spent in the minor leagues.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Bayfield, New Brunswick, he moved to west Calgary as a boy. After a season of amateur hockey on the Calgary Victorias he become a professional player after signing with the Victoria Aristocrats in time for the 1915-1916 season.\nCareer.\nRiley played 17 games in the National Hockey League and 90 games in the Pacific Coast Hockey Association, as a member of the Chicago Black Hawks, Detroit Cougars, and Seattle Metropolitans. He won the Stanley Cup with Seattle in 1917. In 1922–23, he was named a PCHA First Team All-Star.\nIn addition, Riley played professional baseball for 12 seasons, from 1921 to 1932, mostly in the minor leagues. After batting .303 and hitting nine home runs in 56 games for the Vancouver Beavers in 1921 he was signed by the St. Louis Browns. He started his career as a second baseman, and played in four games at that position for the 1921 St. Louis Browns of the American League, thus becoming the only athlete in sports history to play both Major League Baseball and in the National Hockey League. After that season, he switched permanently to first base, and returned to the major leagues with the 1923 Washington Senators, playing two games with them, before resuming his career in the minors. In six major league games, he was 0-for-14.\nHe was inducted into the New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame in 2000.\nPersonal life.\nHe served in England for one in the Canadian Army in 1918 and achieved the rank of sergeant. He served as part of an engineering detachment and played 3rd base on one of the military teams. Due to the Spanish Flu Outbreak causing things to slow down he never saw action and was discharged in 1919 where he returned to Seattle and played seven more seasons there. Upon his retirement from professional sports in 1932 he worked for a distillery in Dallas. He and his family moved to Seguin, TX. He enjoyed playing golf and won an amateur golf title in the 1920s in Vancouver and won the U.S. National Senior Golf Tournament in North Carolina in the 1960s. He played well into his 70s. Suffering from lung and stomach cancer, Riley died in Seguin, Texas, the day of his 74th birthday, May 25, 1969. He is buried at Guadalupe Valley Memorial Park in New Braunfels, TX. In 1973 his wife, Martha, passed away."

        "text": "Velocio–SRAM Pro Cycling, formerly known as Specialized–lululemon, was a professional cycling team based in the United States that competes in elite road bicycle racing and track cycling events. The final-season title sponsors were SRAM Corporation and Cervelo bicycles. Velocio Sports was the holding company for the team and the place-holder during a larger search for a title sponsor.\nBefore 2012, the team was owned by Bob Stapleton's High Road Sports and was known in 2011 as HTC–Highroad Women. Following HTC's withdrawal of sponsorship and the failure to find a replacement sponsor, a new company, Velocio Sports, directed by High Road's former Marketing and Communications officer Kristy Scrymgeour, was set up to own the team, but most of the riders and other staff remained the same. High Road also operated an elite men's professional team known most recently as , which disbanded.\nPrior to 2008, the team was named T-Mobile Women. Columbia Sportswear were a title sponsor from July 2008 until the end of 2010.\nIn August 2015, Scrymgeour announced that the team would be disbanded at the end of the 2015 season. Under Scrymgeour's management, and with the introduction of team time trials world championships for trade teams in 2012, the team has won every TTT world championships in the team's existence.\nHistory.\n2009.\nThe main new riders for the team were the European Time Travel Champion Ellen van Dijk and the Canadian national champion Alex Wrubleski. Alexis Rhodes and Madeleine Sandig left the team and Anke Wichmann and Oenone Wood both retired.\n2011.\nThe main new riders for the team were the Americans Amber Neben and Amanda Miller and the German time trial champion Charlotte Becker. Sadly, in January, Carla Swart died whilst training after being hit by a truck. After winning a stage, Ellen van Dijk won the Ladies Tour of Qatar which was the 400th victory for the team (men's and women's) since 2008. Ina Teutenberg won the fifth round in the Women's World Cup and the team won the seventh round, the Open de Suède Vårgårda team time trial. The team finished second overall in the World Cup. Judith Arndt finished fourth in the individual standings and Teutenberg fifth. At the end of the season Arndt took the third place in the UCI World Ranking, Teutenberg fourth and the team ended in second place in the team classification.\n2012.\nAfter the men's team HTC–Highroad stopped, Kristy Scrymgeour convinced manufacturer Specialized and sports apparel company Lululemon Athletica to perpetuate the women's team in this Olympic year. The team changed slightly: Clara Hughes and Trixi Worrack were the main new recruits, while Judith Arndt, team leader since 2006, joined GreenEdge–AIS. The team had a great year. Ina-Yoko Teutenberg won numerous sprints and finished fourth in the road race of the Olympic Games. Evelyn Stevens had an excellent season by winning at the world cup race Flèche Wallonne, she won a prestigious stage of the Giro d'Italia Femminile and finished on the podium in the end and she won the general classification of the La Route de France. At the end of the season the team was in fourth place in the UCI World Ranking. Ellen van Dijk won the general classification of the Lotto–Decca Tour, the Omloop van Borsele and several stage races. The team dominated especially in the team time trials. Ellen van Dijk together with Stevens, Hughes, Amber Neben and Trixi Worrack or Teutenberg were consistent and undefeated the whole year. At the end of the season the team won the first team time trial at the world championship which was a main goal for the team this year. The team finished second in the UCI World Ranking.\n2013.\nThree riders joined the team in 2013, American cyclists Carmen Small and Tayler Wiles, and the Canadian Gillian Carleton. Charlotte Becker, Emilia Fahlin, Chloe Hosking, Clara Hughes and Amber Neben left the team in the post-Olympic year. The year was marked with a crash of Ina-Yoko Teutenberg at the Drenste 8 in March. She was unable to ride for the remainder of the season and ended her career afterwards. Ellen van Dijk became the leader of the team and had a great season. She won the general classification of a stage race four times as well as several one-day races and finished four times on the podium in World Cup races. Above all she won the World Time Trial Championships. Van Dijk finished 3rd in the final World Cup standings and also 3rd in the UCI World Ranking. Evelyn Stevens had to miss the Tour of Flanders due to a fall.

        "title": "Oklahoma Sooners baseball",
        "text": "Oklahoma Sooners baseball is the NCAA Division I collegiate baseball team of the University of Oklahoma (OU) based in Norman, Oklahoma.\nThe Oklahoma Baseball tradition is long and storied, with two national championships in 1951 and 1994, along with numerous All-Americans. Dale Mitchell, Bobby Jack, Jackson Todd, Glen Castle, and Keith Drumright are two-time All-Americans to have played for the Sooners. Their home field is L. Dale Mitchell Baseball Park, named after the aforementioned Dale Mitchell.\nPrior to 2006, the Sooners hosted regionals at minor league parks in Oklahoma City, first All Sports Stadium and then the venue now known as Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark. Scheduling conflicts with Oklahoma City's Triple-A team, currently known as the Oklahoma City Dodgers, led OU to bid for future regionals at its on-campus stadium.\nHistory.\nThe early years.\nUnlike many programs, such as LSU and USC, Oklahoma did not lack consistency among the coaching ranks in the early to mid 1900s. Bennie Owen is credited as the first head coach of the Oklahoma Sooners baseball program. Owen's first season is listed as 1906 and his final season being 1922. Owen coached the Sooners for a total of 17 years, compiling an overall record of 142–102–4. In 1923 Bill Owen took over as head coach and remained in the position for 4 years. During his tenure the program had a .764 winning percentage with a record of 42–13. OU named Lawrence Haskell the third head coach in the programs history in 1927. He led the Sooners for 15 years, compiling an overall record of 176–74–2.\nJack Baer era (1942-1967).\nJack Baer became the fourth head coach of the Oklahoma Sooners baseball program in 1942. In his 10th year as coach, Baer led the program to new heights, claiming the 1951 national championship in baseball for the first time in school history. The Sooners nearly missed out on that title opportunity. An ESPN story published as a backdrop for the Sooners' 2022 Men's College World Series (MCWS) finals appearance noted that legendary OU football coach Bud Wilkinson, also the school's athletic director, \"didn't care much for baseball, telling the team they couldn't go to Omaha, even after qualifying.\" OU president George Lynn Cross intervened, but only provided a bus to transport the team to Omaha, providing insufficient money for hotels. The team left on the 500-mile (800 km) drive to Norman immediately after the title game, and no team members received championship rings until the 50th anniversary of the championship in 2001, by which time several members had died.\nBaer went on to coach the Sooners until 1967. During his 26-year tenure as coach, Baer amassed 281 victories, a .529 winning percentage, and still remains OU's longest tenured baseball coach.\nEnos Semore era (1968-1989).\nEnos Semore replaced Jack Baer in 1968. Semore became the 5th head coach in the program's history, and led the program through some of its most successful years. During his 22-year tenure as coach, Semore's teams averaged 38.5 victories a year, claiming 9 conference championships and 2 conference tournament titles. Under his direction, the Sooners claimed 4 straight Big Eight titles while also making 5 consecutive trips to the MCWS from 1972–1976. His 1976 squad set a school record that still stands today with 62 victories. The 851 victories he compiled while head coach of the Sooners still ranks first in the programs history. Semore compiled a record of 851–370–1 while at OU. Semore's career winning percentage of .697 ranks in the top 50 all-time in NCAA Division I history.\nLarry Cochell era (1991-2005).\nSemore resigned just days before the start of the 1990 season for medical reasons. Assistant Stan Meek was named interim coach for the 1990 season, during which the Sooners finished 31–26 overall and failed to make the NCAA Division I baseball tournament for the first time since 1983.\nTo replace Meek, the Sooners traveled out west and hired Larry Cochell away from Cal State Fullerton. Cochell replaced legendary coach Augie Garrido at Fullerton when Garrido left for Illinois. During his three seasons at Fullerton, Cochell's teams went 109–68. Although Fullerton had long been considered a baseball powerhouse, OU offered Cochell a financial package that he could not turn down, and he became the seventh head coach in school history.\nCochell wasted no time bringing the team back into the national spotlight. In his first year, Cochell led the team to an overall record of 40–23 and a second-place finish in the Big Eight. The Sooners returned to the NCAA tournament, but were quickly eliminated in regional play, losing their second game to eventual national champion LSU. The following year, the Sooners tied for the Big Eight conference championship, and once again were awarded with a spot in the postseason. The Sooners fared much better winning the NCAA Mideast Regional to earn their first trip to the MCWS since 1976. The Sooners tied for 5th in the 1992 College World Series winning 1 game and losing 2, but Cochell would use the 1992 season to catapult the Sooners to national prominence. The 1992 team finished the season 43–24 overall. After a rebuilding year in 1993, Cochell was poised to return the program to glory.\n1994 national championship.\nIn 1994, Cochell entered his fourth season at the helm of the Sooner program. The Sooners breezed through the 1994 regular season with a record of 42–17. They also posted a 21–9 mark in conference play, but that was only good enough to finish second in the conference. The Sooners were placed in the NCAA Central Regional along with Arkansas St., Stanford, and Texas. In their first game of the regional, OU defeated Arkansas St. 10–3, setting up a second round game with Stanford. Once again OU had no trouble putting runs on the board, defeating Stanford 10–4. After winning their first two games, OU was in the driver's seat for the remainder of the regional. With a berth in the regional championship on the line, the Sooners delivered; they defeated Texas 15–4. Texas avoided elimination to set up a rematch with OU in the championship, but the result turned out the same. The Sooners claimed the Central Regional championship, defeating the Longhorns 6–3. The Sooners were on their way to Omaha, earning their 8th trip to the College World Series.\nThe Sooners were the No. 4 seed in the 1994 College World Series, which set up a first-round game with the No. 5 seed Auburn Tigers. OU continued their winning ways, defeating the Tigers 5–4. The win placed the Sooners in the winner's bracket and set up a second-round game against Arizona St. Arizona St. surprised top-seeded Miami in the opening round 4–0 to advance to the winner's bracket. OU once again won by a single run, 4–3, to advance to the semi-finals. After defeating Miami for a second game and eliminating the Hurricanes, the Sun Devils were looking for revenge, but the Sooners rose to the occasion. Oklahoma eliminated Arizona St., 6–1, to advance to the championship round. The Sooners played Georgia Tech for the championship, who had also won its first three games in Omaha that year. OU's bats came alive in the championship game as OU defeated the Yellow Jackets 13–5 to claim the second national title in school history. Cochell guided the Sooners to a 50–17 overall record after winning the CWS.\nRetirement and legacy.\nOn May 1, 2005 Cochell submitted his letter of resignation to Oklahoma. Cochell resigned after making racial remarks during two separate interviews. Cochell used racially insensitive remarks to describe Joe Dunigan III who was a freshman outfielder and is an African-American. The remarks were not during taped interviews, but were brought to the attention of the university by ESPN after the fact. Cochell would later issue a public statement in which he apologized for the remarks, and the Dunnigan family would later state they forgave Cochell.\nCochell, who had coached for 39 total seasons, was the keeper of the OU baseball program for nearly 15 full seasons. He led the program through one of the most successful eras of its history, including leading them to the 1994 championship, the first in over four decades, despite the quick exit that engulfed his departure, although he was invited back to the introduction of Pete Hughes as head coach in 2013.\nSunny Golloway era (2006-2013).\nSonny Golloway was promoted from associate head coach to interim head coach on May 1, 2005 following the resignation of Larry Cochell. Golloway held the interim tag for the remainder of the 2005 season posting a 12–6 record. The Sooners earned an berth in the 2005 NCAA tournament, but were eliminated in the Oxford regional finals by Ole Miss. Following the 2005 season, the interim tag was removed from the title, and Golloway became head coach of the Oklahoma Sooners baseball program.\nPrior to becoming head coach at OU, Golloway returned to Norman for his second stint with the Sooners Program. Golloway was an assistant coach under Cochell from 1992–1995 before leaving to become the head coach at Oral Roberts. Golloway would coach a total of 8 seasons at Oral Roberts posting a 335–156 record. Following the 2003 season, Golloway left Oral Roberts to return to Norman as associate head coach.\nIn his first full season as head coach of the Sooners, Golloway led the team to a 45–22 record overall. The 2006 team finished 3rd overall in the Big 12, and earned its second straight NCAA post-season berth. In the post-season, Oklahoma was awarded a host site for the regional round of the tournament. After losing their first game to TCU, the Sooners would win 4 straight to earn their first regional title since 1995 and a berth in the super regional round for the first time. Oklahoma traveled to Houston to face the Rice Owls, with the winner earning a berth in the 2006 College World Series. Rice won the first game, but OU was able to come back with a victory in game 2 to force a rubber game. Rice, the No. 2 overall seed that year, was just too much in the pivotal third game of the super regionals, and ended OU's season.\nAfter a promising first full season as coach, expectations for Golloway were increasing. Unfortunately in 2007, the Sooners never lived up to their potential finishing the season 34–24. They failed to make the post-season, but Golloway was determined to keep the program moving in the right direction. The following year, the Sooners finished the season 36–26–1 overall, and once again earned a trip to the post-season. The Sooners would make it all the way to the Tempe regional finals, before coming up short against Arizona St. to end the 2008 season.\nIn his fourth full year as head coach at Oklahoma, Golloway was once again able to keep the program moving in the right direction. OU finished second in the Big 12 posting a 17–10 record in conference play, only a half game behind Texas for the regular season title. After earning the No. 2 seed in the 2009 Big 12 baseball tournament, the Sooners posted a disappointing 1–2 record in pool play. Following the Big 12 championship, the Sooners had a record of 41–18. Despite their poor performance in the Big 12 tournament, they were still rewarded with a host site and the No. 7 national seed in the 2009 NCAA Division I baseball tournament. After winning their first game in the Norman regional, the Sooners fell to Arkansas in the second round. The Sooners would bounce back and defeat Washington St. in an elimination, but once again lost to Arkansas. The Sooners finished the 2009 season 43–20.\nIn 2010, the Sooners finished 50–18. The team swept through their regional and won the super regional against the Virginia Cavaliers 2–1. The Super Regional was highlighted by Cody Reine who had back to back multi-homerun games in games 2 and 3. The Sooners earned their 10th appearance in the College World Series where they won their first game against the South Carolina Gamecocks 4–3. The Sooners then lost to the Clemson Tigers and then lost on a walk-off hit to the Gamecocks in a rematch.\nAfter the 2013 season, Golloway left for Auburn.\nPete Hughes era (2014-2017).\nIn 2014, Pete Hughes, who had previously served as head coach of the Virginia Tech Hokies for the previous seven seasons. In his four seasons with the Sooners, he led them to over 30 wins three times, although his team advanced past the Second Round of the Big 12 Tournament just once (2015), with only one NCAA tournament appearance in 2017, which ended with two losses in the Louisville Regional. After the 2017 season, he was fired by the program.\nSkip Johnson era (2018–present).\nOn June 19, 2017, Skip Johnson was announced as the new head coach of the Sooners. In the 2022 season, Johnson coached the Sooners to the Big 12 Tournament championship defeating Texas, and to the College World Series defeating Virginia Tech in the Blacksburg Super Regional.\nL. Dale Mitchell Baseball Park.\nL. Dale Mitchell Baseball Park is a baseball stadium in Norman, Oklahoma. It is the home field for the University of Oklahoma Sooners college baseball team. It is named after the former OU player Dale Mitchell who holds OU's career and single-season batting records. The park was originally constructed at a cost of $1.27 million and was dedicated in 1982. After two renovations, the current capacity is 2,700 people.\nPlayer awards.\nAll College World Series.\n&lt;br&gt;\nAll-Conference teams.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nConference All-Tournament teams.\n&lt;br&gt;\nExternal links.\n "

        "text": "Dave Roberts (born February 28, 1947) is an American former college football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at Western Kentucky University (1984–1988), Northeast Louisiana University (1989–1993), and Baylor University (1997–1998), compiling a career head coaching record of 67–68–3.\nCoaching career.\nNortheast Louisiana.\nRoberts was the eighth head football coach at Northeast Louisiana University—known as the University of Louisiana at Monroe—located in Monroe, Louisiana and he held that position for five seasons, from 1989 until 1993. His coaching record at Northeast Louisiana was 38–19–2, including a forfeit by Louisiana Tech in 1989.\nBaylor.\nRoberts was the head football coach at Baylor University from 1997 to 1998. He ignited controversy in 1997 when, after a loss to Texas Tech, he stated in a post-game press conference that he had told his players that \"they were about as bad a football team as there is right now in America\", drawing the ire of the Baylor faithful. Following the 1998 season, in which the Bears went 2–9 for a second consecutive season, he was fired by athletic director Tom Stanton. Roberts had previously served as the offensive coordinator under Lou Holtz at the University of Notre Dame. After being fired by Baylor he rejoined Holtz as an offensive assistant at the University of South Carolina.\nAfter 1956 and until 2010, Roberts was the only Baylor head football coach other than Grant Teaff to beat the Texas Longhorns, doing so in 1997 (Grant Teaff coached Baylor for 21 years and had many victories over the Longhorns)."

The two teams first played each other in 1974 and as of 2021 have played a total of 117 games. After the rivalry resumed in 2012, it was branded \"PSO Mayor’s Cup\" with Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO) as its corporate sponsor.\nHistory.\nTulsa University (TU) and Oral Roberts University (ORU) had their first meeting on March 4, 1974, which Tulsa won 85–84. The series has been hard fought since then, and TU holds the edge in the overall series 36–21. The rivalry has been marked by remarkable runs either way: Oral Roberts won 8 consecutive match-ups in the late 1970s; directly following that streak, TU won the next 13 in a row and 24 of 27 between December 8, 1980, and December 19, 2002. The rivalry has become more balanced this century, with TU leading a 9–8 edge over the past 17 meetings. The largest margin of victory was 45 points, by TU over ORU in 1994. Another turning point in the rivalry was TU's hiring of Bill Self away from ORU prior to the 1997–98 season.\nThe Tulsa and Oral Roberts Women's basketball teams have faced off in the series since 1976. The ORU Women's team has dominated, 30–7, including a 20-game streak from 1976 through 1999.\nThe cross-town basketball series has been called the \"PSO Mayor’s Cup\" since 2012, with Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO) serving as the title sponsor.\nThe 2014 PSO Mayor's Cup Men's game, held on November 15 at Oral Roberts' Mabee Center, was won by ORU by a score of 77–68, serving as the second straight win in the series by the Golden Eagles. The 2014 PSO Mayor's Cup Women's game, held on November 21, was also won by ORU by a score of 73–71.\nOral Roberts swept the PSO Mayor's Cup games again in 2015, this time at Tulsa's Reynolds Center, with the Golden Eagle women winning 59–53 on November 20, and the ORU men taking their third in a row in the series, 70–68 on December 5.\nThe series has seen three interruptions in its history: four seasons spanning 1987 to 1991 when Oral Roberts dropped to NAIA status; in 2010-11 when Tulsa would not agree to a date for the contracted game at ORU's Mabee Center, and 2020-21 when TU opted out of games at Arkansas and ORU due to COVID issues in the program."

        "text": "Albert \"Ricketty\" Johnston (1891–1961) was a pioneering Australian rugby league footballer who played in the 1910s and 1920s, and coached from the 1920s to the 1940s. He was a three-quarter for the Australian national team, and played in eight tests between 1919 and 1922, two as captain.\nPlaying career.\nClub career.\nHe was born and grew up in Balmain, Sydney, and started playing rugby league at a junior level when the game commenced in Australia in 1908. In 1911 he made his first grade debut with the Balmain Tigers at half-back. Following Arthur Halloway's move to the Tigers in 1915, Johnston moved to five-eighth and their strong halves partnership was one of factors enabling Balmain to three consecutive premiership titles from 1915 to 1917.\nHe joined Wests for the 1918 season, then spent two years as captain-coach at Newtown 1919–20.\nFollowing his Australian representative appearances in 1920 the admission of the St George Dragons meant that Johnston being a local resident had to play with the club, which he did for his final two club seasons of 1921 and 1922.\nRepresentative career.\nIn 1912 he was selected in a Sydney Metropolis side. In 1913 he was in a New South Wales touring squad to New Zealand as half-back but was kept out of the major matches by the form of his peer Arthur Halloway.\nHe captained New South Wales in some 1918 games and then made his Australian Test debut in 1919 on Australia's tour of New Zealand. He scored a try on debut assisting Australia to a 44–21 victory. With tour captain Halloway unfit for the 3rd Test Johnston led the side to a series victory in Auckland in the process becoming Australia's 11th Kangaroo captain.\nIn 1920 Johnston was chosen for the first Test of the domestic Ashes series. He captained the side to an 8–4 victory over England.Herb Gilbert took over as captain for the 2nd and 3rd Tests but Johnston's continued successful halves pairing with Queenslander Duncan Thompson set a platform for the talented backline featuring Harold Horder, Dick Vest and Gilbert, and Australia won the series and the Ashes for the first time on home soil.\nJohnston did not captain Australia again. He appeared for New South Wales through till 1922 and toured with the 1921-22 Kangaroos playing in the 1st Test and in 11 tour matches.\nCoaching career.\nJohnston coached Newtown in 1923, 1925 and 1926 and Wests in 1924.\nHe coached St George in 1933-35 taking the club to their first premiership final.\nAccolades.\nHe was awarded Life Membership of the New South Wales Rugby League in 1938.\nHe was a state selector from 1938 and state coach from 1939 to 1946. He was a national selector in 1946 and coach of the national side for the 1946 first post-WWII Anglo-Australian series."

        "text": "The chapters of \"The Prince of Tennis\" manga series are written and illustrated by Takeshi Konomi, and were serialized in Japan's manga magazine \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" from July 1999 to March 2008. A sequel to the series entitled \"The Prince of Tennis II\" began serialization in Japan in the monthly magazine \"Jump Square\" on March 4, 2009. The story centers around a cocky tennis prodigy named Ryoma Echizen, who, upon his father's urging, enrolls in a private middle school called Seishun Academy (\"Seigaku\" for short), which, besides being famous for its strong tennis team, is his father's alma mater. The storyline of the first manga series revolves around Seigaku striving to become the National middle school tennis champions, while the sequel takes place several months after their National victory.\nThe \"Prince of Tennis\" manga spans a total of 379 chapters (380 if chapter \"0\" is included), which have been collected into 42 \"tankōbon\" volumes. Shueisha distributed these volumes in Japan, with the first volume being released on January 7, 2000, and the last on June 4, 2008. Each of the chapters are referred to as a \"Genius\", with the exception of chapters 245 to 247 which are primarily referred to as the \"Wild\" chapters since they are told from a different character's point of view. The sequel's chapters are each referred to as a \"Golden Age\". Three official fan books were also released by Shueisha, as well as one illustration book. Kenichi Sakura created a short tribute manga entitled \"The Prince of Afterschool\", which began serialization in \"Jump Square\" in November 2008.\nThe series has been adapted into several forms of other media including a 178 episode anime series directed by Takayuki Hamana that aired from October 2001 to March 2005, and a series of subsequent OVAs released onto several DVDs. The anime, combined with the OVAs, roughly covers the storyline of the first manga series. It also spawned an ongoing series of musicals, as well as two featured films: one original animated film and the other being a live-action which loosely follows the events of the first eighteen volumes.\nViz Media licensed the series and distributes an English version of the manga in North America under the \"Shonen Jump\" imprint. The first English language volume was released on May 19, 2004, and the last one was released on July 5, 2011. The English anime adaptation debuted in North America as streaming media on Toonami Jetstream on July 14, 2006."

Henry, Jr. was born into the military life. Son of Guy Vernor Henry, he went on to graduate from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York in 1898, and distinguished his military career by earning the Silver Star in 1899 during the Spanish–American War.\nHenry went on to study at the French Cavalry School in Saumur and used the knowledge he gained there to change the treatment and training of United States Cavalry horses. This included starting horses not by \"breaking\" them using the traditional western methods, but by training them on the longe, then slowly teaching them to accept the weight of a human on their back. He also brought dressage methods from both the French and German schools, with a great deal of influence from Baucher, and as senior instructor of equitation at the Mounted Service School at Fort Riley he insisted in teaching new recruits to properly use the aids and promoted the European methods. Henry helped to institute the high level of horsemanship at Fort Riley, helping to develop farrier and veterinary programs which were to become required courses for cavalry lieutenants. He also got rid of the harsh curb bit used by the Cavalry, known as the Shoemaker bit, and replaced it with either the snaffle bit or the double bridle.\nOlympic equestrian career.\nHenry competed in all three Olympic equestrian disciplines – dressage, eventing, and show jumping – for the United States during his years in the army. His most distinguished Olympic results occurred at the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm, where he won the bronze medal in the team eventing competition, finished 11th in the individual event, 4th in the team jumping competition, and 13th in the individual dressage competition, riding Chiswell.\nHenry later served at Chef dÉquipe for the United States Teams from 1936 to 1948, was chairman on the Olympic Equestrian Committee from 1930 to 1960, and director of equestrian events at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles."

Brookdale suffered as all young clubs do through several undistinguished seasons, even changing its colors several times as not to be recognized the next season! As the years passed, the club's players and leadership developed and the club eventually found itself playing in the Metropolitan Division I in the late 1970s.\nThe early 1980s saw some strong play by the now Monmouth Rugby Football Club and with some close loses to some perennially powerful clubs. In 1984, the team moved back to Division II and experienced some more tough seasons / years. The early 1990s brought the winning tradition back to Monmouth with a Jersey Cup championship and a return to Division I rugby. After some tough injuries and a few early retirements, the club suffered a couple of rough seasons. Since 1994, the club has shown its resilience by winning three of four second side Jersey Cup championships and has appeared in the National playoff picture 5 times in the past 10 years. The club has made the quarterfinals twice within the 5 appearances, both years suffering close losses to Snake River, Idaho.\nAfter an undefeated season in 02', Monmouth was again brought up to Division I rugby in the Met Union. The club, coping with a declining membership and difficult scheduling, endured for three years on the Division I level. The prospect of the Super League and competing against a larger population base brought them back to Division II. During the 1990s Monmouth has won the Jersey Cup Tournament three times and placed second in the premier division in the Saranc Lake Tournament.\nMonmouth Rugby Club has started the 2009 fall season by winning the Jersey Shore Tournament's Premier bracket with wins over Schuylkill River, Reading and New York Rugby Club. The 2009 fall season finished with Monmouth being beaten by Middlesex, MA in the semifinal of the Northeast Championships on Randall's Island, leaving Monmouth Ranked 4th in the Northeast.\nMonmouth started the Fall 2010 season by winning their own invitational tournament, beating Princeton Athletic Club in the Final. Monmouth finished the Division 1 regular season 4 - 4. This put Monmouth in the NE crossovers against Boston Irish Wolfhounds who had just come down to D1 from SuperLeague. The step up was too much for Monmouth and they were well beaten by the Wolfhounds in Canton.\nSpring 2011 has seen Monmouth recruit well and they are looking forward to a big fall season in Division 1.\nMonmouth finished the 2011 Fall season as the #1 ranked team in MetUnion Division 1.\nNotable players.\n\"Note: caps and participation are accurate as of 23 April 2007\"\nRob Morello - best scrum half in the union, as well as 2001 Region 6 Wrestling Champion, 135 lbs."

The side has continued to appear in minor cricket and now competes in the Hawke Cup competition.\nFirst-class history.\nIn their first match at first-class level, against Wellington at the Basin Reserve in February 1884, Hawke's Bay were dismissed for just 32 in their second innings thanks to Joseph Firth's remarkable return of 8 for 13 from 13 four-ball overs. In their next match, in 1884–85, they beat Wellington at Napier Recreation Ground by eight wickets.\nThey lost their next three matches, all against Wellington, before trouncing Taranaki in two matches in 1891–92. In the first of these matches they dismissed Taranaki for 70 and 39 and the game was over in one day. In the second match Hawke's Bay made 128 then dismissed Taranaki for 35 and 29.\nHawke's Bay's matches remained low-scoring affairs. They did not reach a total of 200 until their 17th match in 1895–96, when they made 207 against Wellington in a drawn match. Their first individual century came in 1897–98, when Hugh Lusk made 119 against Canterbury. However, low scores were the norm in New Zealand at the time: in the eight first-class matches in New Zealand in the 1897–98 season, only two centuries were scored, Lusk's and one by another Hawke's Bay batsman, Jack Wolstenholme.\nHawke's Bay played 53 first-class matches, for 11 wins, 35 losses and seven draws. Twenty-four of those matches were against their neighbours, Wellington; Hawke's Bay won six of these and lost 14. They lost both their Plunket Shield matches (against Canterbury in 1914–15 and Auckland in 1920–21) by an innings.\nLeading first-class players.\nHugh Lusk made three of Hawke's Bay's five first-class centuries. He was by far Hawke's Bay's outstanding batsman: in 28 matches he scored 1395 runs at an average of 28.46, and also took 40 wickets at 22.85, as well as captaining the side in most of his matches and representing New Zealand.\nThe highest first-class score for Hawke's Bay was 134 against Wellington in 1914–15 by Jack Board, the English Test player who coached in Hawke's Bay for several seasons before World War I. The best innings bowling figures were 9 for 47 by Tom Dent against Wellington in 1900–01, and the best match figures were 13 for 33 (7 for 20 and 6 for 13) by Charles Smith in the second match against Taranaki in 1891–92.\nSince 1920–21.\nAlong with Southland, Hawke's Bay lost their first-class status after the 1920–21 season, leaving just four first-class teams in New Zealand: Auckland, Canterbury, Otago and Wellington. In reorganising domestic first-class cricket, the New Zealand Cricket Council chose only those teams that could afford to travel to take part in an annual round robin tournament for the Plunket Shield. In the 1920s Hawke's Bay played several overseas teams in non-first-class matches, including Australia, the MCC, New South Wales, Queensland and the Melbourne Cricket Club, all at Nelson Park.\nHawke's Bay began competing in the Hawke Cup in the 1922–23 season. They have won the Hawke Cup 12 times. Their first victory was in 1946–47. They have dominated the competition in recent years, holding the title from February 2020 to November 2022, and from November 2023 through to the end of the 2023–24 season undefeated.\nIn 1950–51 the Central Districts cricket team began competing at first-class level in the Plunket Shield. Tom Reaney from Hawke's Bay was in Central Districts' inaugural Plunket Shield team in December 1950. \nThe Hawke's Bay Cricket Association is one of Central Districts' eight constituent associations. The eight associations compete against each other annually for the Chapple Cup and the Mike Shrimpton Trophy.\nGrounds.\nHawke's Bay played first-class matches on the following four home grounds:\nAs well as Nelson Cricket Ground and Nelson Park, Hawke's Bay has also used the following grounds for Hawke Cup matches:\nMcLean Park has also been a regular home ground for Central Districts since 1951–52, and has been used as a Test ground since 1978–79. Nelson Park has also been used by Central Districts since 1985–86."

        "title": "Creighton Bluejays men's basketball",
        "text": "The Creighton Bluejays men's basketball team represents Creighton University of the NCAA Division I college basketball. It competes in the Big East Conference, which it joined following the Big East conference realignment in 2013. The Bluejays play their home games at CHI Health Center Omaha in Omaha, Nebraska. Creighton finished sixth nationally in home attendance, averaging 17,048 fans per home game in 2014–15.\nBefore joining the Big East, Creighton was a member of the Missouri Valley Conference from 1976 through 2013. The Jays were also members of the MVC from 1928 to 1948 and participated as an independent from 1948 to 1977 before rejoining the MVC. The Bluejays have won a record 15 MVC regular season conference titles and a record 12 MVC tournament titles.\nThe team has 23 appearances in the NCAA tournament. The Jays last played in the NCAA Tournament in 2024, and have won at least one NCAA tournament game each of the last four seasons.\nCreighton reached the second weekend of the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament for the first time in 2021, before losing to eventual runner-up Gonzaga in the Sweet Sixteen. In 2023, they reached their second Elite Eight Regional Final in program history before losing to eventual runner-up San Diego State.\nHistory.\nArthur Schabinger era (1923–1935).\nArthur Schabinger took over the program after Kearney's graduation. He guided the team into its first conference, the North Central Conference, in 1923. His teams would win 4 titles in the league. In 1928, Shabinger would again guide Creighton to another conference, the Missouri Valley Conference. Creighton's winningest men's basketball coach for 75 years, Arthur A. Schabinger helped build the Creighton basketball program. Schabinger posted a 165–66 record as coach of the Bluejays from 1922 to 1935. Eleven of his 13 teams finished first or second in the league, including eight teams that won or tied for the title.\nEddie Hickey era (1936–1947).\nEddie Hickey took over the program for the 1935–36 season. Hickey was reared in small-town Nebraska and graduated from Creighton University School of Law in 1926. Sawed-off at 5'5\", Edward 'The Little Giant' Hickey was a dynamic chunky man who had quarterbacked Creighton university football in the Roaring 20's. He was enamored more by the game he could teach if not, obviously lacking size, play well. He was the head coach of both the football and basketball teams at Creighton Prep for eight years before moving to Creighton University.\nHickey was a master of the fast break and winning. He immediately led the Bluejays to the Missouri Valley title in his first season. Their fast break – 'controlled fast break' Eddie would emphasize sarcastically – featured an explosive movement that required the ball not to hit the floor. 'The Little Giant' would take Creighton to new heights by the early 1940s, with 1943 Consensus First Team All American Ed Beisser in the middle and his high powered offense. Hickey would lead the Jays to their first NCAA tournament and two National Invitation Tournaments, including a Final Four (Third-place game winner) in 1942, (when the NIT was bigger than the NCAA tournament). With his flair for 'run-sheep-run' basketball, Hickey and his teams were a good show in the Big Apple.\nWorld War II would briefly suspend Creighton's basketball program and Hickey would return to coach for one year after the war before moving on to St. Louis. His 126–71 record and four conference titles in nine seasons at Creighton was followed by success in St. Louis and later Marquette. Edgar Hickey would go down as a hall of fame coach with a 36-year college career of 570–268.\nPost-war era (1948–1959).\nThe post-war era was full of change and mediocrity for the Jays. Future athletic director Julius 'Duce' Belford coached the Jays immediately after the war. Creighton would leave the Missouri Valley Conference and switch from Division I to Division III during this era. The Jays would not find success at this new level. Belford finished with a 56–83 record over six seasons. His successors would not fare better. Sebastian 'Subby' Salerno took the reins in 1952 and left three years later. Salerno finished with a 30–45 record. Theron Thomsen replaced Salerno and found some success. After eight losing seasons, Thomsen's 1956–57 Bluejays would post a 15–6 mark. However, the Jays would slide back toward mediocrity finishing 10–12 and 13–9 in the following two seasons. In 1959, Athletic Director Duce Belford made it a priority to bring back the once proud Creighton basketball program.\nJohn 'Red' McManus era (1960–1969).\nJohn J. 'Red' McManus came to Creighton after a successful career of eight seasons at St. Ambrose Academy and a year as head freshman and assistant varsity coach at Iowa. The 1959–60 Bluejays were a far cry from the previous year's team. Whereas the team had previously utilized a slow methodical type of basketball, McManus brought a fast break offense and a box zone defense. Utilizing sharp recruiting and tough coaching, Red quickly had the Bluejays back on the road to becoming a national power. The 1961–62 Creighton Bluejays men's basketball team finished 21–5 and reached the Sweet Sixteen of the 1962 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, going on to win the third spot in the NCAA Regional. Paul Silas was the nation's top rebounder.\nThe 1963–64 Bluejays finished with a 22–7 record, a record for most wins in a season. All-American and team captain Paul Silas rounded his collegiate basketball career by leading the team back to the Sweet Sixteen in the 1964 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. Silas, who guided the Bluejays to two NCAA tournament berths in his three-year career, led the nation in rebounding his sophomore and junior years.\nMcManus would continue to coach at Creighton until 1969. He would go down as the third-winningest coach in school history, leaving with a 138–118 mark. Red McManus was a colorful character, with a mean streak who was always a respected gentleman off the court. He rebuilt the Jays' schedules into coast-to-coast clashes with the nation's top basketball powers. His teams got NCAA post-season tourney bids in 1962 and 1964, and his players included professionals Paul Silas, Neil Johnson, Elton McGriff, Bob Portman and Wally Anderzunas. McManus resigned after building a schedule of national prominence-the job he was hired to do.\nEddie Sutton era (1970–1974).\nOne of college basketball's legendary coaches, Eddie Sutton got his first Division I head coaching job at Creighton. Sutton left College of Southern Idaho in 1969 to coach at Creighton. It was with the Bluejays that he made his first coaching appearance in the NCAA tournament in 1974. With a patient passing offense, he led the Bluejays to an 82–50 mark between 1969 and 1974.\nSutton's career coincided with the apex of the Travelin’ Jays Era. Red McManus coined the phrase \"border to border and coast to coast\" in 1959 when he began the Travelin’ Jays era, but it was under Eddie Sutton that the philosophy really bore fruit and gained the Jays national recognition. During his last three years at Creighton, the Bluejays played in 36 cities and 20 states, logged more than 65,000 miles in the air, made a South American jaunt (entertaining the Chile national team at home in exchange), and visited Hawaii. Sutton was a Tulsa native, and in 1974 a bidding war commenced between Oral Roberts, Duke, and Arkansas for Sutton's services. Arkansas won the battle, announcing Sutton as their new head coach on March 27, 1974.\nOver an illustrious 37 year coaching career, Sutton compiled an 804–328 record, putting him eighth on the all-time Division I wins list. He became the first coach to lead four schools to the NCAA Tournament, taking Creighton, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Oklahoma State.\nTom Apke era (1975–1981).\nAssistant coach Tom Apke took over for the departing Sutton. Apke planned to run the same defensive schemes Sutton had: namely, a fierce man-to-man base defense, with a 2–3 zone as a change-up. The offense was where major changes were made. Apke looked to run a fast break at every opportunity, taking advantage of every shot opportunity. The news media was pessimistic as Apke entered his first season. Prognostications grew even worse after Mike Heck, Creighton's first 7 footer and a rising star, suddenly died because of an enlarged heart after the first game of the season. The 1974–75 Creighton Bluejays rallied after Heck's death and ended up reaching the 1975 NCAA tournament finishing with a 20–7 record.\nApke led Creighton back to the Missouri Valley Conference in 1977 after 29 years of independence. He found instant success winning the 1978 conference regular and conference tournament titles and advancing to the 1978 NCAA tournament. The Bluejays would continue winning at a high level again returning to postseason play in the 1981 NCAA tournament.\nAfter the 1980–81 season, Apke accepted the head coaching position at Colorado. Apke spent 17 years in all at Creighton – four as a player, six as an assistant coach and seven as head coach. He is the only coach in school history to have led Creighton to the NCAA Tournament in his first season with the team (1974–75). A team captain on Creighton's 1964–65 team, Apke went on to coach the Jays to a 130–64 record from 1974–81. Three of his teams went to NCAA tournaments and another to the National Invitation Tournament.\nWillis Reed era (1982–1985).\nSutton and Apke's departures upset Creighton officials who yearned to make the program 'big time'. Officials hinted that the new head coach would be a 'big name' hire. Former New York Knicks great Willis Reed fit the bill. After being fired in 1978 after a season and a fraction as the Knicks' coach, Reed was determined to prove himself as a coach. Reed accepted the position at Creighton, generating controversy in the Bluejay community.\nLongtime assistant coach Tom Broshnihan, who had been around since Sutton, was seen as the rightful heir to the Creighton head coaching job. A sizable segment of the fan-base criticized Reed as lacking experience in college coaching and recruiting. High school basketball in Nebraska produced a record number of prospects prior to Willis Reed's first season. Reed was unable to sign any of the blue-chips, including Ron Kellogg and Dave Hoppen. It did not help that Reed was breaking the color barrier, becoming the first black head basketball coach at Creighton.\nComing off Tom Apke's impressive 21–9 season featuring an NCAA appearance, Reed's inaugural 7–20 mark added fuel to the fire. Reed proved himself as a recruiter that off-season. Considered by many scouts to be the top prospect in the country, Benoit Benjamin was sought by 350 colleges. Benjamin came from a single-mother home and looked for a father figure, preferably a college coach who had played center. Fortunately for Creighton, coach Willis Reed was a former seven-time NBA All-Star center with the Knicks and a member of the Hall of Fame.\nBenjamin's signing gave Reed instant credibility as a recruiter. Despite the landmark signing, the Jays would again struggle in 1982–83 finishing with an 8–19 record. Coach Reed worked with Benjamin over the off-season. Benoit came back as a sophomore in 1983–84 and dominated college basketball. The Bluejays would reach the NIT that year finishing 17–14. The 1984–85 season team would win 20 games. As a junior during the 1984–85 season, Benoit Benjamin led all of NCAA Division I in blocked shots and was the nation's second-leading rebounder. Benoit Benjamin would leave for the NBA following the season. A two-time AP All-America center for the Bluejays, Benoit Benjamin would begin a 15-year NBA career in 1985 as the third overall draft pick in the first round by the Los Angeles Clippers. He would go down as the all-time leader for blocked shots in Missouri Valley Conference history with 411 rejections. Coach Reed had proven himself as a coach, recruiting a top prospect and developing him into one of the nation's best.\nWillis Reed resigned as coach of the Creighton University basketball team after the 1984–85 season. He compiled a 52–65 record at Creighton. His 1984–85 Bluejays were 20–12 but lost their last six games. Reed felt that he would be unable to maintain a high level of success without violating NCAA rules.\nTony Barone era (1985–1991).\nInheriting Reed's team was fiery Tony Barone. His 1985–86 team posted a 12–16 record, finishing tied for fifth in the Valley. Coach Barone's second team would fare even worse finishing 9–19. During the off-season, Creighton would bring in a talented class of freshman including Bob Harstad and Chad Gallagher. The pair would go down in Creighton lore as the Dynamic Duo. The 1987–88 squad would exhibit markedly improved play, finishing 16–16 after playing a schedule featuring some of the top teams in the country.\nThe 1988–89 team would be Tony Barone's breakthrough team. Creighton surprised everyone outside Omaha and claimed its first regular season MVC championship in 11 years. The Bluejays would cap the season by winning the MVC conference tournament in epic fashion. The conference championship saw Harstad lead the Jays over Southern Illinois 79-77. The game was punctuated by a James Farr game winner with 2 seconds remaining. Creighton clinched an automatic berth to the 1989 NCAA tournament with the win.\nCreighton followed up their NCAA Tournament berth in 1988–89 by winning more games overall than the year before, going 21–12 in 1989–90. The consensus favorite to repeat as MVC champions, they got off to a good start, as they scored wins over Iowa State and Notre Dame before going on the road and taking #5 Missouri to the wire. They would finish tied for second in the conference and bow out of the conference tournament semifinals. Juniors Bob Harstad and Chad Gallagher would have break out seasons. Harstad would win the 1990 Missouri Valley Conference Player of the Year Award. Gallagher would finish as runner-up.\nExpectation were high entering the Dynamic Duo's senior season. The 1990–91 Creighton Bluejays finished as one of the school's all-time best, finishing 24–8. The Jays claimed both the regular season and conference tournament crowns before advancing to the second round of the 1991 NCAA tournament. Chad Gallagher was named the 1991 Missouri Valley Conference Player of the Year. Gallagher and Harstad both rank in the top five all-time in both scoring and rebounding for Creighton. Together they won two MVC regular season and conference tournament titles as well as two NCAA and one NIT appearances. Following the 1990–91 season, coach Tony Barone accepted the head coaching job at Texas A&amp;M.\nRick Johnson era (1991–1994).\nAssistant coach Rick Johnson was promoted to head coach following Tony Barone's departure. Johnson's tenure at Creighton was a struggle. His teams finished with progressively worse records. He left after the 1993–94 season in which the team posted a 7–22 mark. Johnson finished with a 24–59 record over three seasons at Creighton.\nDana Altman era (1995–2010).\nRodney Buford era.\nDana Altman, a Wilber, Nebraska native, left his position as head coach at Kansas State for Creighton in 1994. Altman immediately went to work rejuvenating the program. He struggled at first posting a 7–19 record in his first year. That off-season, Altman signed Rodney Buford. Altman's Jays improved to 14–15 and 15–15 the following two seasons. After the 1996–97 season, coach Altman brought in talented prospects Ryan Sears and Ben Walker. The two, along with Buford, would help rebuild Creighton into a college basketball power. The 1997–98 team finished 18–10 and reached the NIT. The 1998–99 team would finish second in the Valley and reach the 1999 NCAA tournament after claiming the MVC conference tournament title. The Jays reached the second round following a 62–58 first-round victory over Louisville. Rodney Buford would finish as the all-time leading scorer for the Jays, with 2,116 points.\nRyan Sears &amp; Ben Walker era.\nThe 1999–2000 would repeat as MVC conference tournament champions, earning a berth in the 2000 NCAA tournament. Led by Juniors Ryan Sears and Ben Walker and MVC Newcomer of the Year Kyle Korver, the Jays would finish with a 23–10 record. The 2000–01 team improved to 24–8 and won the first Missouri Valley Conference regular season title in 9 seasons. Senior guards Ryan Sears and Ben Walker finished their careers with another trip to the NCAA tournament. Creighton's field marshal, Sears started every game of his 4-year career and finished each of his four seasons with more steals than turnovers. Walker, Creighton's go-to player during late-game situations, finished with 1,238 points and 677 rebounds.\nKyle Korver era.\nThe 2001–02 team was replacing both Ben Walker and Ryan Sears and defending a regular season MVC crown, yet behind Kyle Korver's brilliance, they shared the league title and won the MVC Tournament while having a nearly identical record as the year before at 23–9. Korver's deadly 3-point shooting forced many teams to employ a box and one defense against the Creighton star. Despite the added attention, Korver scored 20 or more points 10 times. The Creighton-Southern Illinois Rivalry reached its peak during the early 2000s. Korver scored a combined 49 points in two regular season losses before leading the Jays to victory over the Salukis 84–76 in the conference championship game. Kyle Korver was named the 2002 MVC Player of the Year. In the 2002 NCAA Tournament, the Jays vanquished Florida in the first round. Korver fouled out late in the second overtime and saved the late game heroics for Terrell Taylor, who drained a buzzer-beating three-pointer.\nThe Bluejay bandwagon was growing and the Jays consistently sold out the 9,377 capacity Civic. Expectations were at a record high entering the 2002–03 season. Creighton would live up to most of them, setting a school record for wins. The team went 29–5 and was ranked in the top 25 most of the season. Kyle Korver would be chosen by ESPN's Dick Vitale as the 2002–03 Midseason National Player of the Year. Korver would set a school record with nine three-pointers against Evansville and repeat as MVC conference Player of the Year. The Jays would finish second in the Valley behind rivals Southern Illinois, but once again knock off the Salukis in the conference championship game throttling them 80–56. The Jays would finish ranked 15th following the 2003 NCAA tournament.\nTwo-time league Player of the Year Kyle Korver ranks as one of the top players in Creighton and Missouri Valley Conference history. Korver finished his career tied for sixth in NCAA history with 371 three-pointers while placing 14th in accuracy at 45.3 percent from long-range. Korver helped lead Creighton's return to the top-25 and garnered unprecedented attention for his all-around play. He had a successful NBA career and last played for the Milwaukee Bucks in September 2020. As of April 2022, he is a free agent.\nNate Funk era.\nCreighton's basketball program had grown too big for the Civic Auditorium and the Jays moved into the 17,975 seat Qwest Center, now known as CHI Health Center, prior to the 2003–04 season. The Jays would fill up the arena on a consistent basis and become one of the nation's perennial leaders in attendance.\nThe sharpshooter torch was passed from Kyle Korver to sophomore guard Nate Funk for the 2003–04 season. He responded by leading the team in both scoring and assists. The 2003–04 Jays would finish 20–9 and reach the NIT. Funk took a massive leap forward his junior year, going from the best player on his own team to arguably the best player in the league. The 2004–05 team finished 23–11 and won the MVC conference crown. Nate Funk was runner-up for the conference player of the year and the Bluejays earned a berth in the 2005 NCAA tournament.\nThe 2005–06 Creighton men's basketball team entered the season with high hopes that were cut short when star guard Nate Funk went down with injury in a game at DePaul. Funk would try to make a comeback but wasn't the player he had been. He would request and receive a medical redshirt. Without Funk, the Bluejays still managed a 20–10 record reaching the second round of the 2006 NIT.\nNate Funk returned for his fifth season and center Anthony Tolliver emerged as one of the best players in the conference. Although the team 2006–07 team struggled early, the team found its groove down the stretch as Funk scored 20 or more points in 11 games and Tolliver dominated the post. The 2006–07 team finished 22–11 and won the MVC conference tournament over rival Southern Illinois 67–61 to earn a berth in the 2007 NCAA tournament. For his career, Nate Funk had 1,754 points, which ranks sixth all-time in Creighton history.\nArkansas fiasco.\nOn April 2, 2007, Altman announced that he would become the head coach for the Arkansas Razorbacks, in a deal that was rumored to be a five year, $1.5 million per year contract. Only one day later he had a change of heart and returned to Omaha and his team at Creighton, citing family reasons. Altman never again reached the NCAA Tournament at Creighton even though his teams would continue to post 20 win seasons.\nThe 2007–08 team finished the season 22–11, but would lose in the quarterfinals of the MVC tournament. The Bluejays received an invitation to the NIT where they defeated Rhode Island before losing to Florida. The 2009 Bluejays shared the MVC regular season title and was led by Booker Woodfox. Despite the Bluejays gaudy 26–7 record, a loss to Illinois State in the semifinals of the MVC Tournament led to another trip to the NIT where they would lose in the second round to Kentucky. The 2009–10 team would be Altman's last, finishing 18–16. Dana Altman accepted the head coaching position at Oregon shortly after the season ended.\nCreighton's all-time winningest coach with 327 wins, Dana Altman was the only coach in MVC history to lead his school to seven straight years of improved records. Altman won three MVC regular-season titles, six MVC Tournament crowns, and led his troops to 13 consecutive postseason bids.\nGreg McDermott years (2010–present).\nFormer Northern Iowa coach Greg McDermott resigned from Iowa State and accepted the head coaching job at Creighton following Altman's departure. The 2010–11 Jays finished 23–16 and reached the finals of the College Basketball Invitational to face their former head coach's new team, Oregon. The Ducks would win the best-of-three series two games to one. The following year, the Jays featured senior point guard Antoine Young and Rutgers transfer Gregory Echenique in the post. Coach McDermott's son, Doug McDermott, emerged as a star player, being named a consensus first-team All-American and MVC Player of the Year in both 2012 and 2013. In 2012, Creighton finished second in the Valley during the regular season and won the MVC Conference tournament. Finishing the season 29–6, they advanced to the second round of the NCAA tournament by beating Alabama before falling to North Carolina. In 2013, Creighton won both the MVC regular-season and Tournament titles, ending the season 28–7. They defeated Cincinnati in the first round before losing to No. 2-seeded Duke in the second round.\nShortly after the end of the 2013 season, Creighton was one of three schools invited to join the Big East Conference by the \"Catholic 7\", the group of schools that split from the original Big East to form a non-football version of the league.\nIn their first season in the Big East, Creighton finished as runner-up in both the regular season (to Villanova) and Tournament (to Providence). Doug McDermott was named Big East Player of the Year, was again named a consensus first-team All-American, and was the consensus national player of the year. Also, McDermott became only the eighth player in Division I men's basketball history to score 3,000 career points, finishing fifth on the all-time scoring list. The Jays received a No. 3 seed in the NCAA tournament, their highest seeding ever. They beat Louisiana-Lafayette in the second round, but lost to No. 6-seeded Baylor in the Third Round.\nWith the departure of Doug McDermott to the NBA, the 2015 Bluejays struggled to a 14–19 record, their worst finish since 1995. In 2016, the Bluejays improved to 20–15, finishing in sixth place in the Big East and receiving an invite to the NIT. They advanced to the NIT quarterfinals before losing to BYU.\nThe 2017 Bluejays returned to a conference power, beginning the season 13–0. Led by senior point guard Maurice Watson Jr, the Bluejays moved to 18–1 (their only loss to No. 1 Villanova) before Watson tore his ACL and was lost for the remainder of the season. Shortly after he was injured, Watson was arrested for sexual assault and was suspended from the team. With the loss of Watson, the Bluejays lost seven of their remaining 12 games to finish the regular season at 23–8 and in a tie for third place in the Big East. They were able to rebound in the Big East tournament, advancing to the championship game before losing to Villanova. They received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as a No. 6 seed and lost to Rhode Island in the first round.\nIn June 2017, Coach McDermott received interest from the Ohio State University to fill its head coaching vacancy. However, he turned down the offer choosing to remain at Creighton.\nOn March 22, 2022, McDermott received a \"multi-year\" contract extension. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. The Bluejays finished the 2022–23 season with a 24–12 record. They advanced to the Elite Eight for the second time in school history, and first time since 1941.\nOn March 8, 2024, McDermott received another contract extension to keep him at Creighton through the 2027-2028 season; his previous contract was due to expire after the end of the 2025-2026 season. The new contract also makes McDermott one of the highest-paid coaches in the Big East.\nFacilities.\nVinardi Center.\nThe Bluejays went 336–92 (.785) in 42 seasons in the 3,000-seat Vinardi Center (then known as University Gym) from the time Creighton began sponsoring men's basketball in 1916 through the 1959–60 season. Creighton split its home games between University Gym and the Omaha Civic Auditorium from 1955–60 before moving into the Civic full-time for the 1960–61 year.\nOmaha Civic Auditorium.\nHome to Creighton men's basketball from 1955 to 2003, the Omaha Civic Auditorium provided a tremendous home-court advantage for the Jays. Creighton went 434–155 (.737) overall in the facility. The Civic was home to five regular-season MVC champs and eight MVC Tournament champs before the CU men closed their run at the Civic in 2003 with six straight sellouts. The Jays returned to the Civic for the first time in seven years in 2010, winning two CIT games when CenturyLink Center Omaha was booked.\nCHI Health Center Omaha.\nHome to Creighton men's basketball since 2003, CHI Health Center Omaha ranks as one of college basketball's best venues. The arena was originally known as Qwest Center Omaha, changing in 2011 to CenturyLink Center Omaha after Qwest was purchased by CenturyLink. When CenturyLink opted out of the naming rights contract after the 2017–18 season, a new deal was reached with locally based healthcare provider CHI Health, and the arena was accordingly renamed in September 2018.

He told reporter Pat Curran that it was a \"perfect goal.\" \"Bill Gadsby was yelling at me on one side and Gordie was shouting on the other and telling me to take the lead out. He knew we had a three-on-two break. When I dumped the puck over he shot past (Canadiens' goalie Charlie) Hodge on the short side.\" Montreal Canadiens' legends Jean Béliveau and Jacques Laperrière were defending on the play."

        "text": "Carlence Marquis \"Keith\" Mitchell (born July 24, 1974) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) for the New Orleans Saints, the Houston Texans and the Jacksonville Jaguars between 1997 and 2003. He played college football for the Texas A&amp;M Aggies.\nHigh school and college.\nMitchell attended Lakeview High School in Garland, Texas and went to an outstanding college career at Texas A&amp;M, where he was part of a star-studded defense known as the \"Wrecking Crew\". He was a talented pass rusher who was among the NCAA leaders in quarterback sacks during his junior and senior years. He had 34 career sacks for the Aggies and 18.5 career tackles behind the line of scrimmage. As a senior, Mitchell had 14.5 sacks and 10.5 other tackles for loss. Although constantly double-teamed, he still managed 50 solo tackles as a senior. Mitchell was the defensive MVP of the Aggies' 1995 Alamo Bowl victory over Michigan. He was named to \"The Sporting News\" college All-America second-team and to the first-team \"College Football News\" All-American team as an outside linebacker in 1996.\nNFL.\nIn spite of his collegiate success, Mitchell was not selected in the NFL draft because of concerns over his lack of bulk and ineffectiveness in coverage. He was signed by the New Orleans Saints and found immediate success with that club, appearing in 79 consecutive games during 5 seasons with the team, and making 60 starts over his final 4 seasons (in which he averaged 93 tackles and 4 sacks). His Saints career was highlighted by a 2000 season where he recorded 6.5 sacks, had 2 defensive touchdown returns, and was named to the Pro Bowl.\nHis success with the Saints was based largely on the fact that former defensive coordinator Ron Zook played to Mitchell's strengths and employed three down linemen with an outside linebacker (usually Mitchell) lining up as a defensive end. Mitchell's role had been similar as a college player, where he saw most of his success utilizing his great speed as a blitzing outside linebacker.\nIn 2001, Charlie Clemons replaced Mitchell as the Saints' rush end linebacker, producing a team-leading 13.5 sacks and an interception. Mitchell recorded only two sacks that year. Mitchell asked for his release following the 2001 season, and was signed by the Houston Texans. Mitchell started 7 consecutive games for the Texans in 2002, but his playing time was limited as a result of injuries, and he did not appear in a game after November 17 of that year. He was signed as an unrestricted free agent in March 2003 by the Jacksonville Jaguars and started for the Jags first two games of the 2003 season, his last in the NFL, but was injured and only appeared in one game for the remainder of the season."

        "text": "The 2005 UK Championship (officially the 2005 Travis Perkins UK Championship) was a professional snooker tournament and the 2005 edition of the UK Championship. It was held at the Barbican Centre in York, North Yorkshire, England from 5 to 18 December 2005. The competition was the second of six World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association ranking events in the 2005–06 snooker season, the first of the three Triple Crown events, and the tournament's 29th edition. It preceded the Malta Cup and followed the Grand Prix. It was broadcast in the United Kingdom and Europe on the BBC and Eurosport.\nThe defending champion was Stephen Maguire, who had won the previous year's event with a 10–1 win over David Gray in the final. Maguire reached the third round where he was defeated 8–9 by six-time world champion Steve Davis. Davis in turn was defeated 10–6 in the final by Ding Junhui, who won his second career ranking title. Ding was the first player from outside the British Isles to win the UK Championship, and the second youngest player to win it since Ronnie O'Sullivan triumphed in the 1993 competition. In the semi-finals Ding beat Joe Perry 9–4 and Davis defeated seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry 9–6. The tournament's highest break of 145 was shared by Davis, John Higgins and Michael Holt.\nFormat.\nThe UK Championship tournament was created and first played as the United Kingdom Professional Snooker Championship in 1977 and was open to residents in the United Kingdom and holders of British passports. Seven years later all professional players were allowed to enter and snooker's governing body, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), granted the tournament ranking status. It is considered to be snooker's second most important ranking tournament behind the World Snooker Championship and is one of three of the sport's Triple Crown events.\nThe 2005 event was held between 5 and 18 December at the Barbican Centre in York, North Yorkshire, England. It was the second of six WPBSA ranking events of the 2005–06 snooker season, following the Grand Prix and preceding the Malta Cup. Held in October, the Grand Prix was won by John Higgins who defeated his rival Ronnie O'Sullivan nine frames to two (9–2) in the final. The defending UK Champion was Stephen Maguire, who had defeated David Gray 10–1 in the previous year's final. The 2005 UK Championship was sponsored by builders' merchant and home improvement retailer Travis Perkins, and was broadcast by the BBC and Eurosport.\nThe tournament featured 48 participants with 16 seeded players, who were given a bye to the second round. The remaining 32 competitors were awarded by a three-round qualification tournament. The qualifying stage was played between players ranked 17 and those ranked lower for one of 16 places in the final stage between 31 October and 5 November at Pontin's Snooker Centre, Prestatyn, Wales. The matches were best-of-17 frames until the final. Ding Junhui, the China Open champion, beat Fergal O'Brien 9–4 in the third stage of qualifying. The other successful qualifiers included the likes of Ryan Day, Stuart Bingham and Mark Allen.\nPrize fund.\nThe tournament had a prize fund of £495,875, with £70,000 being awarded to the winner. Below is a breakdown of the prize money awarded.\nSummary.\nRound 1.\nThe 16 first-round matches were between players ranked 17–32 and those who had made it through the qualifying stage. In this round Ian McCulloch lost 9–7 to Jamie Burnett in spite of the score tied at 4–4 at the first session's conclusion and him compiling breaks of 64, 71, 118, 52, 65 and 63. World number 18 Barry Pinches lost his match against Dominic Dale with a heavy 9–3 defeat, while Ali Carter beat Jamie Cope by the same scoreline, and Marco Fu won 9–6 over Michael Judge. Gerard Greene received a walkover to the next round after his opponent the world number 22 Quinten Hann failed to appear for the match and withdrew from the tournament for undisclosed reasons. Breaks of 84, 83, 74, 62 and 61 gave Ding a 5–3 advantage over Anthony Hamilton, and he won four successive frames in the game's second session to take a 9–3 win and progress to the second round. World amateur champion Allen claimed a 9–6 victory over 2004 UK Championship runner-up David Gray and Joe Swail won seven frames in a row en route to defeating Andy Hicks 9–3.\nMichael Holt defeated Ricky Walden 9–8, a match in which Holt had a frame docked. He was warned by referee Patricia Murphy for conceding a frame too early in frame eight. Holt was further cautioned for \"ungentlemanly conduct\" when he was heard swearing seven frames later, leading Murphy to deduct a frame because he was warned twice. That put him 8–7 behind but he recovered with a 56 break in the final frame decider. After 1991 world champion John Parrott was defeated 9–5 by Mark Davis he admitted that winning another ranking event in his career was not possible. Neil Robertson achieved a break of 123 in him narrowly beating Rory McLeod 9–8, and world number 30 Barry Hawkins achieved breaks of 118 and 100 en route to a 9–5 win over Stuart Pettman. World number 37 Stuart Bingham, the winner of the Masters Qualifying Event in November, took a 9–4 victory against Robert Milkins with successive breaks of 95, 77 and 88, while Dave Harold lost 9–7 to Nigel Bond. A break of 133 helped James Wattana beat Drew Henry 9–4, and Mark King emerged a 9–4 winner over Ryan Day.\nRound 2.\nThe winners of round one went through to face members of the top 16 in the second round. In this round world number 6 Paul Hunter, suffering from neuroendocrine tumours, won the deciding frame of his near seven-hour match over Burnett 9–8 on both the pink and black balls and Hunter received a standing ovation from the crowd. Higgins was tied 2–2 with Greene but he claimed seven of the next eight frames of the match that had a break of 145 in frame ten from Higgins who won 9–3. Fu came from 8–5 down against Ken Doherty to tie the match at 8–8 and force a final frame decider that Doherty won with a score of 9–8. At one point in his match eighth seed Peter Ebdon was equal 4–4 with Dale but he claimed five successive frames for a 9–4 success. After dominating Holt 7–1 with breaks of 110, 91, 73 and 64, number 10 seed and two-time world champion Mark Williams followed up with two of the next three frames to advance into the third round 9–2, after which he spoke of his relief that the win would prevent him from losing his top 32 world ranking status.\nWorld number 4 and Pot Black and Northern Ireland Trophy champion Matthew Stevens was the second highest ranked player to lose in the round when he lost 9–3 over Bingham as the match's second session lasted more than an hour. Ninth seed and 1992 UK champion Jimmy White was beaten 9–3 by Ding who led 8–0 after the first session. White won three successive frames in the second session with a best break of 106 on the pink ball in frame ten to prevent a whitewash before Ding won the match with a 77 run. Stephen Lee lost 4–9 to Robertson. Trailing 3–2 Robertson concluded the first session 5–3 ahead. Lee won frame nine with a break of 124 and led 52–0 before Robertson cleared with 76 for 64. Robertson added the next three frames with runs of 90, 55 and 53 to win. Six-time world champion Steve Davis led Allen 8–3 but he was temporarily prevented from winning as Allen took the score to 8–7 before Davis claimed a 9–7 success. Shaun Murphy, the surprise world champion, beat Bond 9–7 despite taking painkillers before and during the match to ease pain from prior dental surgery that saw four of his teeth removed and affected his vision.\nWorld number one Ronnie O'Sullivan established a 5–3 advantage over King but he lost the first three frames of the evening session. O'Sullivan conceded the eleventh frame early, leading to a warning by referee Alan Chamberlain for transgressing tournament rules, and he later scolded O'Sullivan for draping a white towel over his face and head during a prolonged safety shot exchange in frame 15. Down 8–6 O'Sullivan made breaks 106 and 86 to force a final frame decider that King won with a run of 46. World number two and seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry overcame Wattana 9–7. Coming from 7–5 behind Hendry accumulated breaks of 100, 79, 109 and 69 with a sequence of 355 unanswered points to win 9–7. Stephen Maguire, the defending champion, took less than an hour to clinch the three match-winning frames for 9–2 victory against Swail. Of the other seeded players in round two, Graeme Dott was edged out by Mark Davis 9–8, Joe Perry overcame Hawkins 9–7 and Alan McManus lost 9–4 to Carter.\nRound 3.\nIn the third round Doherty and Higgins shared the first four frames of their match before Doherty made a 107 break and another century to move 4–2 in front. Higgins won two more frames to equal the score at 4–4. Doherty later made three century breaks of 127, 107 and 102 over Higgins to level 6–6 and runs of 64, 52 and 46 in the final three frames won him the match at 9–6, after which he remarked it was his best match since losing to Williams in the 2003 World Snooker Championship final. Bingham was the second player to progress to the quarter-finals with his 9–2 victory over his practice partner Mark Davis. In his match with Ding Hunter played with a loss of feeling in both of his hands and feet, as he went 7–1 behind and took one frame in the next session as Ding secured a 9–2 victory. Ebdon became the sixth top ten ranked player to be eliminated from the competition when he lost 9–7 to Carter. Having recovered from being 4–0 and 7–4 behind to equal the match at 7–7 Ebdon missed the final black ball shot on its spot on the table in the 15th frame and he lost the next frame on a brown ball.\nHendry established a 6–2 advantage during the first session of his match against Williams with breaks of 136, 94 and five more over 40 as Williams did not score a single point in four frames. Hendry claimed the second session's first frame before Williams took the next which the former responded to win 9–3. Davis emerged a 9–8 victor over Maguire. Going 5–3 and then 7–4 ahead Maguire appeared set for a comfortable victory but Davis came back with safety play and a total clearance of 145. In the final frame Maguire missed a straightforward red ball and Davis made a 78 run for the win as Davis outscored Maguire 296–1 in the final three frames. Robertson and Murphy tied at 4–4 until the former won two successive frames. Murphy responded with breaks of 66, 90 and 88 to move 7–6 in front before both players shared frames. Robertson clinched the final frame decider with a break of 47 to win 9–8. King held a 6–2 lead over Perry at the end of his match's first session with a season-high break of 136 but Perry won seven consecutive frames to clinch a 9–6 victory.\nQuarter–finals.\nIn the quarter-finals Hendry was the first player to progress to the semi-finals with a 9–7 victory against Carter. Holding a 5–3 advantage in an opening session that included an unsuccessful maximum break attempt from Carter as the cue ball was in the jaws of a corner pocket on the 14th black ball shot, Hendry extended his lead to 8–4 before Carter won three frames in a row with runs of 73, 57 and 61. In frame 16, and on a break of 35, Carter misjudged a safety shot to split a pack of red balls and Hendry made a break of 64 to claim victory. Davis took 53 minutes to claim frame one over Doherty and he followed with the next four with runs of 54 and 81 to hold a 5–0 advantage. During frame six, Doherty fluked a re-spotted black ball to reduce the deficit but Davis restored his lead of five frames at the first session's conclusion. Doherty came from 8–4 down to narrow the margin to 7–4 and then 8–7. But Davis prevented Doherty from taking the game to a final frame decider when he executed a double shot to pot the black ball into the middle pocket and win 9–7.\nDing continued his strong form by defeating Robertson 9–5. Breaks of 102, 77, 65 and 54 gave Ding a 5–3 lead. Upon the resumption of the match Ding increased his advantage to 8–4 before he finished the match with a break of 92 to overturn Robertson's 36-point lead in frame 14. After the match Ding spoke of his happiness over the win as it ensured he would rise into the top 40 in the provisional world snooker rankings after the tournament's while Robertson praised his opponent's white ball control. Perry edged out Bingham 9–8 to enter the UK Championship semi-finals for the second successive year and Bingham's 13-game winning streak in all competitions ended in a tightly contested match. Perry won frames one and two with breaks of 94 and 73 before Bingham's 92 and 70 breaks concluded the first session at 4–4. Bingham appeared to progress to his first career ranking tournament semi-final at 8–7 but Perry forced a final frame decider with a 100 century break. Perry won the half an hour final frame, outscoring Bingham 79–14 after potting a long-range red ball off the baulk cushion.\nSemi–finals.\nIn the semi-finals Davis reached his 100th career final, and aged 48 became the oldest finalist in a ranking tournament since Rex Williams in the 1986 Grand Prix with a 9–6 win over Hendry. Davis entered the evening session 7–1 ahead with runs of 57 and 81 but Hendry added five of the first six frames including a 130 break for a new scoreline of 8–6. Hendry was on course to win frame 16 but he missed a straightforward black off its spot while 59–0 in front and Davis responded to win the match with a 66 clearance. After the match Davis said it was \"a double bonus\" for himself because of him beating his rival Hendry and reaching his 100th career final, \"I played a really great frame to go 8–2 up and everything was going nicely, but I botched chances in the next two and then Stephen started playing better.\" In contrast, Hendry revealed he was indecisive when before he missed the black ball shot that lost him the possibility of winning the game, \"I changed my mind about what shot to play and it's a fatal mistake to make.\"\nThe other semi-final match had Ding defeat Perry 9–4 to become the first non-British or Irish player to compete in the final of the UK Championship in its 29-year history. After going through the first frame without scoring a point Ding won the second without Perry challenging him. Ding backed it up with century breaks of 129 and 100 and a half-century of 76 to lead Perry 5–3 after the first session. Ding moved clear from Perry with three successive frames and he completed the victory with a break of 131 in the 13th frame. The result ensured Ding, the tournament's youngest player, would face its oldest competitor Davis in the final. Ding said afterwards that he did not feel up to acceptable standard upon entering the competition because of his form in the qualifying rounds but spoke of his belief that he could win. Perry admitted that his opponent outperformed him during the match but reserved praise for Ding's playing style, \"I never felt like I was in the match tonight. Ding played better than me throughout. You have to rate him up there with the best now and he looks like becoming world champion in the not too distant future.\"\nFinal.\nIn the best-of-19-frame final Ding defeated Davis 10–6 to become the first non-British or Irish player to win the UK Championship. He became the second youngest player after O'Sullivan in the 1993 tournament to win the UK Championship, the second lowest ranked participant (world number 62) to claim overall victory, and the second 18-year old to win two career ranking titles. The victory earned Ding £70,000 in prize money; although he moved from 62nd to 31st in the provisional world rankings, it did not permit him to play in the Masters as Ian McCulloch was awarded a wild card and Shaun Murphy was seeded for all of the season's events. Ding was also not guaranteed automatic qualification to the World Snooker Championship. Nonetheless, Jon Wilde of the \"Evening Chronicle\" wrote that Ding had during the match \"produced some fantastic break-building and tactical awareness that was beyond his 18 years.\"\nIn the afternoon session both players shared the match's first six frames with a break of 111 from Ding in the third. In frame seven Ding retook the lead with a break of 81 and he established a two frame lead after Davis missed a straightforward red ball shot to a corner pocket to end the first session 5–3 ahead. In the evening session Davis conceded 33 points in fouls but was still in contention until he was out of position on a run of 40 and Ding took frame nine after 38 minutes. Davis received a reprieve from Ding after missing a simple pink ball shot to claim frame ten, but he missed a blue ball to the middle pocket while on a break of 39 in the eleventh because he concentrated solely on manoeuvring the cue ball. It allowed Ding to produce a 77 clearance and he followed it with 52 and 78 runs in the 12th frame to lead 8–4 at the mid-session interval. When play resumed Davis made a break of 72 to lower his deficit but Ding immediately re-established a four-frame advantage in frame 14. A break of 74 enabled Ding to lead frame 15 as Ding could not land the required snookers needed. At 9–6 Davis played a poor positional shot on the green ball and Ding cleared the table up to the pink ball to win the match and the tournament.\nAfter the match Ding spoke through an interpreter to thank the audience for their support, \"This is the second-most important ranking tournament, so it is a great pleasure to win it. York is a big step for me. I've gained loads of confidence and experience here.\" He also said that he felt additional pressure than in the China Open but spoke of his hope that more Chinese players would venture to England to play snooker. Davis praised Ding's playing style and spoke of his expectation that more Chinese players would take up snooker, \"Ding was stronger than me throughout the final and played great\". He also said that he deserved to win the final and that additional players from \"China will emerge on the back of this\".\nMain draw.\nNumbers to the left of the players' names are the tournament seedings.

He is remembered for being co-founder of the Brisbane Broncos club. The Paul Morgan Medal for the Brisbane Broncos' best and fairest player of the season is named after him. He is best remembered as improving the conditions of players of the game of rugby league in Australia and was the key architect of the Super League concept.\nFootballer.\nMorgan attended Brisbane State High School where he was a pupil of former Queensland Maroons captain, Cyril Connell, Jr. Morgan represented Queensland in rugby league in his first year out of school and went on to play for the Bulimba Cup-winning Toowoomba team of 1970 alongside Wayne Bennett. He later played in Brisbane for Redcliffe and was their goal kicker.\nAdministrator.\nIn 1986 Paul Morgan joined Barry Maranta, Gary Balkin and Steve Williams to form a Brisbane-based club for the New South Wales Rugby League premiership, Australia's top rugby league club competition at the time. All men had played for Brisbane domestic teams. Four organisations made bids for the team which would be established in 1987. Ron McAuliffe, had the support of the NSWRL over the Maranta-Morgan group, other groups included 'International Syndicate' led by John Sattler and Bob Hagan, and one by Darryl van der Velde (who would later be CEO of the South Queensland Crushers).\nThe NSWRL decided not to have a Brisbane club in 1987 but in a final bid for the 1988 season, both McAuliffe and Maranta-Morgan bid for the club. The NSWRL finally decided to have a Brisbane-based team and thus the Brisbane Broncos were born. The rights originally were going to go to the McAuliffe based group, but when it was realised they didn't have the funds to support the club, it was given to Maranta-Morgan.\nHowever the Maranta-Morgan group did not please everybody, especially Australian Rugby League chairman Ken Arthurson, who decided to add other (now defunct) Queensland-based teams, Gold Coast in 1988 and South Queensland in 1995.\nMorgan was a stockbroker by trade; he was in charge of Pacific Sports Entertainment, the company that owns the Brisbane Broncos.\nPaul Morgan died of a heart attack while playing golf in Brisbane. He was 54. He left a widow, Suellen Morgan. The day after his death the Brisbane Broncos played against St Helens R.F.C. in England for the 2001 World Club Challenge wearing black arm-bands in honour of Morgan, and the Broncos' player of the year award was named after him. Paul Morgan's son, Lachlan Morgan played for the Toowoomba Clydesdales in the 2006 Queensland Cup grand final."

        "text": "Thomas Joseph McCarthy (July 31, 1960 – April 13, 2022) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player who played nine seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played for the Minnesota North Stars and Boston Bruins from 1979 to 1988. He featured in the 1981 Stanley Cup Finals with the North Stars and the 1988 Stanley Cup Finals with the Bruins.\nAfter retiring as a player, he became a part-owner of the Espanola Express hockey team in the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League (NOJHL).\nEarly life.\nMcCarthy was born in Toronto, on July 31, 1960. He was the first overall pick in the 1977 OMJHL Midget Draft, making him one of two players drafted ahead of Wayne Gretzky. Oshawa Generals general manager Sherwood Bassin chose McCarthy over Gretzky primarily because Gretzky had made it known prior to the draft he only intended to play one season in the OHL before signing with the World Hockey Association. McCarthy scored 69 goals in 63 games played for the Oshawa Generals during the 1978–79 season. \nPrior to the NHL entry draft in 1979, McCarthy who was 19 at the time, and his agent Art Kaminsky threatened to sue the NHL over the minimum age of 20 to be eligible for the entry draft. The NHL moved the draft from June to August and lowered to minimum age for draft eligibility. McCarthy was drafted in the first round (tenth overall selection) of the 1979 NHL Entry Draft by the Minnesota North Stars.\nPlaying career.\nMcCarthy joined the North Stars after the draft at the age of 19 and made the team's opening day roster for the 1979–80 NHL season, playing in a 4—1 win over the Hartford Whalers on October 11, 1979. His first NHL point came in his third game against the Buffalo Sabres on October 14, 1979, and his first two NHL goals against the New York Rangers in a 7—2 win on October 27, 1979. McCarthy finished the regular season with 36 points, scoring 16 goals and logging 39 penalty minutes. The North Stars finished 3rd in the Adams Division with a record of 36–38–16 and qualified for the 1980 Stanley Cup playoffs. In the first round, the North Stars swept the Toronto Maple Leafs in three games with McCarthy scoring 5 points with 2 goals. In the second round, the North Stars defeated the Montreal Canadiens in 4 games to 3, and during the series, McCarthy had one goal and one assist. In the semi-finals, the North Stars were eliminated four games to one by the Philadelphia Flyers, with McCarthy scoring 4 points with 2 goals.\nHe was selected to play in the 1983 NHL All-Star Game and ended that year with 28 goals in a career-high 80 games played. During the 1983–84 season, he finished fifth in the NHL in game-winning goals (7), seventh in power play goals (16), and ninth in shooting percentage (23.6). In the summer of 1985, he checked into rehab in California for alcohol dependency. Later in the 1985–86 season, McCarthy had a number of injuries, missing the season opener with a knee injury, then later suffered injuries to his wrist, shoulder, thumb and contracted influenza.\nMcCarthy was later traded to the Boston Bruins on May 16, 1986 for second and third-round picks. The trade came after a series of injuries and McCarthy arriving late for practice on multiple occasions, McCarthy also did not agree to a contract extension with the North Stars and was set to become a free agent. McCarthy did agree to a new contract with the Bruins before the trade was completed. During his first season with the franchise, he recorded the fourth-highest shooting percentage (24.8). McCarthy retired as a player at the end of the 1987–88 season, finishing his career with 178 goals and 399 points. He had 12 goals and 38 points in the playoffs. At the start of the 1989–90 season, McCarthy tried out for the Vancouver Canucks, failing to make the roster.\nFormer North Stars general manager Lou Nanne described McCarthy as \"one of the most talented\" North Star players of all time. During his playing time he earned the nickname \"Jughead\", and often played on a line with centre Neal Broten and Hall of Fame winger Dino Ciccarelli.\nLegal issues.\nAfter McCarthy retired from the NHL, he resided in Minnesota. There, he became involved with drug dealer Carl Thompsen. His activities resulted in McCarthy receiving a prison sentence of five years and ten months for conspiracy to traffic a truck full of marijuana in 1994. As he was considered an illegal alien by U.S. authorities, he was sent to the U.S. Federal Leavenworth Penitentiary. He started a hockey program at Leavenworth, earning the respect of his fellow inmates and, eventually, a transfer to a prison in Canada to complete the final year of his full sentence. McCarthy credited the hockey program he began in prison for stirring his passion for coaching.\nCoaching career.\nAfter his release from prison, McCarthy coached junior hockey in Mississauga, Ontario, before becoming head coach of the Huntsville Otters of the OPJHL, and later the Trenton Golden Hawks of the OJHL.\nMcCarthy was named head coach of the North Bay Trappers Junior \"A\" Hockey Club of the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League (NOJHL) on June 27, 2011. He remained there for two seasons, leading the team to a NOJHL championship in 2013. Later that same year, Tim Clayden – the Trappers' owner – founded an expansion team that same year called the Espanola Rivermen and brought McCarthy on as head coach. McCarthy stayed with the Rivermen when they left the NOJHL to join Clayden's new league, the Canadian International Hockey League, which lasted just one season before folding in 2015.\nThe NOJHL announced in May 2015 the establishment of another expansion team in Espanola called the Express. McCarthy joined the team as one of the owners and its head coach. In August of the following year, McCarthy announced he was taking a head coaching position with HSC Csíkszereda in the Romanian Hockey League but would continue to remain involved with the Express as one of the owners. He later resigned as Csíkszereda‘s coach in late November 2016. He subsequently returned to Espanola as the Express' head coach for the 2017–18 season.\nPersonal life.\nAfter retiring from coaching, McCarthy resided in Chuburna, Yucatán, Mexico. He was married to Tina McCarthy at the time of his death.\nMcCarthy suffered a dissected aortic aneurysm and died in the hospital following surgery in Chuburna, Yucatán, Mexico, at the age of 61."

It is located in Mapo Village in the Shunyi District in Beijing.\nThe first competitions at the venue were held in August 2007, a year ahead of the 2008 Olympic Games for which it was built. The World Junior Rowing Championships, China Open Canoe/Kayak Slalom and China Canoe/Kayak Flatwater Open were all held in that month as part of the \"Good Luck Beijing\" series of sporting events. The 10 km marathon swimming event and the second qualifying event of the 2008 Summer Olympics were also held there.\nSlalom course.\nThe slalom course is generally considered to be difficult, even by Olympic standards. The water speed is 7.5 meters/second. With a drop of 6.3 meters (21 ft), the 300-meter course has a 2.1% slope of 20.9 m/km (110 ft/mile).\nPowered by electric pumps, the slalom course is located at the southwest corner of the long rectangular rowing pond, from which it draws its water. Its western loop is the competition course; the eastern loop, with branches, is for training and warmup. Conveyor-belt boat lifts carry paddlers to the start pool.\nThe green and red numbers on the map show the gate configuration used for the finals at the 2008 Olympics. There were six upstream gates (red numbers): two in right eddies, three in left eddies, and gate #10, the S-turn gate, in the middle of the stream below a midstream stack of plastic bollards. Paddlers entered gate #10 from the left side and exited from the right. The drop between gates #14 and #15 was called \"stir fry\".\nGates #3 and #4 were both upstream gates, side by side below the same drop. Paddlers did a figure-8 maneuver, crossing the tongue of water produced by the drop to get from #3 to #4. This difficulty was added for the finals. Earlier heats had #3 as a downstream gate above the drop, and gate #6 as an upstream gate to preserve the number of upstream gates.\nSix of the green downstream gates were wider than normal (2, 5, 8, 13, 15, &amp; 19) with each pole hanging from its own wire to allow one pole to be farther downstream than the other.\nThe last picture in the gallery below shows construction features which have recently become standard for such courses: vertical side walls (except for strategically placed slanted walls to dampen water oscillations), modular turbulence generators on the channel floor, and clusters of movable plastic bollards attached to the floor as water diverters. There are no concrete boulders in the channel.\nStreet circuit.\nTo continue with the success of the Olympic Games, Shunyi District has agreed an investment of 300 million yuan to build facilities for motor racing.\nThe track will be inaugurated by hosting the 11th round of the 2010 Superleague Formula season."

He is a former World Snooker Young Player of Distinction and practices at Potters Snooker and Pool Club in Swadlincote, Derbyshire, a club which he co-owns.\nHaving never previously been beyond the last 16 of a ranking event, Gilbert reached the final of the 2015 International Championship where he lost 5–10 to John Higgins. On 22 January 2019 he hit the milestone of the 147th maximum break in the Championship League. On 4 May 2019 he narrowly missed out on his first ever World Snooker Championship final in a final frame decider, losing out 16–17 to John Higgins. On 13 August 2021 Gilbert won his first world ranking title after 22 years of being a professional by winning the 2021 Championship League after beating Mark Allen 3–1 in the final.\nSnooker career.\nEarly career.\nGilbert began his professional career by playing UK Tour in 1999, at the time the second-level professional tour. In the 2007–08 season Gilbert reached the last 32 of three tournaments without progressing further. Most notably he qualified for the 2007 World Championship where he led Stephen Hendry 5–1, before succumbing to a 7–10 defeat. To qualify he beat Alfie Burden, Gerard Greene and Mark King.\nThe other two were the 2007 Welsh Open – where he won his two qualifying matches then beat James Wattana in the last 48 in Newport, before losing 5–0 to Steve Davis – and the 2008 Grand Prix, where he again faced Hendry and again challenged him before succumbing 5–4.\nGilbert went one better at the 2009 Welsh Open, beating Mark Williams and Joe Perry before losing to Mark Selby in the last 16.\n2011/2012 season.\nThe 2011–12 season was somewhat of a breakthrough year for Gilbert as he reached the last 16 in two ranking event tournaments for the first time. He went from qualifying round one to the venue stage of the first tournament of the year, the Australian Goldfields Open, beating Passakorn Suwannawat 5–4, Alfie Burden 5–2, Dave Harold 5–4 and Mark King 5–0 to set up a wildcard round match at the venue against James Mifsud, which was later changed to a last 32 encounter due to the withdrawal of Graeme Dott. Gilbert won 5–1 to meet Mark Williams in the last 16, and was beaten 2–5.\nGilbert struggled to replicate the form he showed in Australia until the final and biggest tournament on the snooker calendar, the World Championship. He qualified with victories over Stuart Carrington, Jimmy Robertson (with a final frame decider), Mike Dunn and Fergal O'Brien and drew 11th seed Martin Gould in the first round. There he won his first-ever match at the Crucible 10–8, although he had to withstand two comebacks after leading 6–2 and 9–5. In the second round he was defeated by 2010 World Champion, Neil Robertson 9–13. Gilbert had led 3–1 after the first four frames, but then trailed 3–5 and 6–10 after the first and second session respectively. He finished the season ranked world number 57, inside the top 64 who automatically retained their places for the 2012–13 season.\n2012/2013 season.\nFollowing on from Gilbert's successful 2011/2012 season, he struggled for form this season as he could only qualify for the World Open in Haikou, China. There, he beat Lu Ning 5–0 in the wildcard round, before losing 4–5 to Matthew Stevens in the first round. Gilbert played in eight of the ten minor-ranking Players Tour Championship events, but could only win three matches all year, to finish a lowly 86th on the Order of Merit. He couldn't repeat last season's run to The Crucible as he was defeated 6–10 by Marco Fu in the final round of World Championship Qualifying. He ended the campaign ranked world number 41.\n2013/2014 season.\nGilbert's 2013–14 season was his most consistent year to date as he qualified for all but two of the ranking events. In his opening match, he defeated Jak Jones 5–3 to qualify for the 2013 Wuxi Classic in China where he beat Andrew Pagett 5–2 in the first round. He went on to beat Alan McManus 5–2 to reach the last 16 of a ranking event for the fourth time but lost 5–2 to Joe Perry.&lt;ref name=\"2013/14\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A month later at the minor-ranking Rotterdam Open, he defeated Ryan Day 4–3 in the last 16 and Stephen Maguire 4–1 in the quarter-finals. Gilbert led Mark Selby 2–0 in his semi-final match, but was beaten 4–3. The tournament was one of the eight European Tour events on the calendar and Gilbert performed well in the others with two further last 16 runs to finish 16th on the Order of Merit and qualify for the Finals for the first time in his career. There, Gilbert gained revenge over Selby by whitewashing him 4–0, but lost 4–1 to Perry in the second round.\nGilbert played in his third World Championship this year after seeing off Jimmy Robertson in the final round of qualifying. He faced the previous year's runner-up Barry Hawkins in the first round but from 4–2 up he lost eight frames in a row to succumb to a 10–4 defeat in a performance he branded as useless.\n2014/2015 season.\nGilbert lost 5–3 to Stephen Maguire in the first round of the 2014 Wuxi Classic and then failed to qualify for the next two ranking events.&lt;ref name=\"2014/15\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the International Championship he defeated Zak Surety 6–4, before withstanding three century breaks from Marco Fu to take the match into a deciding frame which Gilbert lost. He won his first matches at the UK Championship 6–4 against Elliot Slessor and 6–2 against Mark Joyce, but lost in the third round 6–2 to David Morris. Gilbert was eliminated at the first round stage of the German Masters, Welsh Open and Indian Open. He faced the winner of the previous ranking event Joe Perry at the China Open and won the last three frames to defeat him 5–3 and then saw off Zhou Yuelong 5–2 to reach the last 16 of a ranking event for the sixth time. Gilbert's tournament ended with a 5–2 loss to reigning world champion Mark Selby. Gilbert was ranked 35th after the World Championship, the highest he had finished a season at that time.\n2015/2016 season.\nGilbert was eliminated in the qualifying rounds of the opening two ranking events of the season.&lt;ref name=\"2015/16\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the minor-ranking Ruhr Open he won four matches to play in the quarter-finals where he beat Barry Hawkins 4–2, before losing 4–3 to Tian Pengfei in the semis. Gilbert's form continued later in to the month at the International Championship as he knocked out Xiao Guodong 6–5, Oliver Lines 6–4 and Ryan Day 6–4 to play in the first ranking event quarter-final of his career. He came back from 4–2 down against Marco Fu to edge it 6–5 which included a 130 break and then saw off Thepchaiya Un-Nooh 9–5. In the final, Gilbert was level with John Higgins at 4–4, but would lose 9–5. The £65,000 runner-up's cheque is by far the biggest of his career and he moved up to 21st in the world rankings afterwards. Gilbert stated that his newfound form was down to a new cue he acquired from fellow professional Matthew Selt six weeks previously. Gilbert was knocked out in the third round of both the UK Championship and China Open 6–3 to Marco Fu and 5–3 to Higgins respectively. Gilbert won three matches to qualify for the World Championship and faced Ronnie O'Sullivan in the first round. He was defeated 10–7, but said it was the best he had ever played without winning a match. He moved up to world number 22 at the end of the season.\n2016/2017 season.\nGilbert saw off Rod Lawler 5–0, Zhou Yuelong 5–2 and Zhang Anda 5–0 to play in the quarter-finals of the World Open, where he was beaten 5–2 by Neil Robertson. He had a pair of 6–2 victories over Adam Duffy and Mark Joyce at the UK Championship and made two centuries from 3–0 down against Ali Carter to edge through 6–5. Gilbert lost 6–2 to Jamie Jones in the fourth round.

        "title": "International Luge Federation",
        "text": "The International Luge Federation (French: Fédération Internationale de Luge de Course (FIL); German: Internationaler Rennrodelverband) is the main international federation for all luge sports. Founded by 13 nations at Davos, Switzerland in 1957, it has members of 53 national luge associations and is based in Berchtesgaden, Germany. In reaction to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, in March 2022 the FIL banned all Russian athletes, coaches, and officials from its events, suspended all Russian officials appointed to its Commissions and Working Groups, and deemed Russia ineligible to host any of its events.\nHistory.\nEarly beginnings.\nThe first luge competition took place on February 12, 1883, on a four-kilometer course between Davos and Klosters, Switzerland, with the co-winners from Australia and Switzerland having a time of 9 minutes, 15 seconds. Austria, Germany, and Switzerland founded the \"Internationaler Schlittensportsverband\" (ISSV - International Sled Sport Federation ) in 1913 in Dresden, Germany. The first European Luge Championships took place in Reichenberg, Bohemia (now Liberec, Czech Republic) in 1914. World War I in Europe caused the ISSV operations to be suspended and prevented any additional competitions until 1927.\nRebirth and merging into FIBT.\nIn 1927, the ISSV was reestablished with the second European Luge Championships taking place in Schreiberhau, Germany (now Szklarska Poręba, Poland) the following year with a women's competition included. The ISSV was absorbed into the Fédération Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing (FIBT - International Bobsleigh and Tobagganing Federation ) in 1935 and was part of the \"Section de Luge\" until the early 1950s.\nIndependence from FIBT.\nAt a 1954 International Olympic Committee (IOC) meeting in Athens, Greece, it was determined that luge would replace skeleton as a Winter Olympic discipline. Skeleton, which had been a sport both at the 1928 and 1948 Winter Olympics, would not return as an Olympic sport until the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. In 1955, the first World Luge Championships were held at Holmenkollen near Oslo, Norway. The FIL was established in Switzerland in 1957 with membership granted into the IOC at their congress in Sofia, Bulgaria that same year. Bert Isatitsch of Austria was elected President of the FIL.\nFIL growth.\nAt the 1959 IOC meeting in Munich, West Germany, luge was approved for inclusion into the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck with competitions taking place in neighboring Igls. 12 nations took part in the first Winter Olympic luge competitions with timing taking place in 1/100ths of a second. Following a tie in the men's doubles competition between East Germany and Italy at the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan, the FIL began timing all of their competition in 1/1000ths of a second, a practice that continues as of 2009. The first natural track European championships took place in Kapfenberg, Austria in 1970 while the first natural track World Championships took place in Inzing, Austria in 1979. The first Junior World Championships on artificial track took place at Lake Placid, New York, United States three years later.\nFIL today.\nIsatitich died suddenly on February 8, 1994, and then Vice-President for Sport Josef Fendt took over as Acting President. Fendt would be named president at the FIL congress in Rome, Italy later that year, a position he held until 2020.\nIn reaction to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, in March 2022 the FIL banned all Russian athletes, coaches, and officials from its events, suspended all Russian officials appointed to its Commissions and Working Groups, and deemed Russia ineligible to host any of its events. Also in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian Luge Federation's Natalia Gart was expelled from the FIL Executive Board.\nFIL events.\nThe FIL governs competitions on artificial tracks and natural tracks at both the European and World Championship levels. At the Winter Olympics, only artificial track competitions are contested. The events at the European and World Championships are men's singles, men's doubles, women's singles, and a team event consisting of one run each from men's singles, men's doubles, and women's singles.\nArtificial tracks are tracks that have their curves specifically designed and banked with walled-in straightaways. Made of reinforced concrete and cooled with ammonia refrigeration, these tracks are smooth and have g-forces of up to 4g (Four times the athlete's body weight). Men's singles on most tracks have their start house close to the bobsleigh and skeleton start locations while both the men's doubles and women's singles have their start house located further down the track. As of 2009, there are sixteen bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton artificial tracks worldwide with a 17th track near Moscow that will host Junior World Cup events in November 2009. Another track in Russia near Sochi, the Sliding Center Sanki, will be in use for the 2014 Winter Olympics, had construction started in May 2009 following controversies at a previous location over track start heights and it being near World Heritage Site, including near an endangered species of brown bear.\nNatural tracks are tracks adapted from existing mountain roads and paths, including a horizontal track surface and natural track icing. Most of the over 60 tracks are located in Austria, Italy, Germany, Poland, Canada, the United States, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Croatia, Russia, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, New Zealand and Slovenia.\nFIL Hall of Fame.\nIn 2004, the FIL established a Hall of Fame for the greatest competitors in luge. As of 2008, there have been a total of six inductees.\nFIL Presidents.\nSince its founding in 1957, FIL has had three presidents, Bert Isatitsch from Austria (1957–94), Josef Fendt from Germany (1994–2020), and Einars Fogelis (2020-current) from Latvia.\nMembers.\n53 nations in June 2021:\nChampionships.\nResults:"

        "text": "James Roberson Brown (April 25, 1910 – December 29, 1977) was a Major League Baseball infielder and coach.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Jamesville, North Carolina, he played college baseball for the North Carolina State College (now North Carolina State University) Wolfpack. Brown was a switch-hitter who threw right-handed; he was listed as tall and .\nCareer.\nHe signed with the St. Louis Cardinals afterwards and made his major league debut two days before his 27th birthday. He made an immediate impact, not only scoring 9 triples his rookie year, but also leading the league in sacrifice hits with 26. His 1938 season was not as impressive, but he did manage to increase his batting average over .300. Brown had a career year in , not only leading the league in at-bats with 645, but finishing 6th in MVP voting. He began being known as a reliable leadoff hitter and as an infielder that the Cardinals could put anywhere, having played primarily as a second baseman, as a shortstop, and as a third baseman.\nAfter a decent season in 1940, he came back with another great year in 1941, tying a career high in triples with 9, earning a career high batting average with .306, and finishing 4th in MVP voting. This, however, was still not enough to earn an all-star appearance. In 1942 he managed to earn his lone all-star appearance and finish 13th in MVP voting. Despite this and leading the league in at-bats with 606, his batting average dipped to .256, a career low. Despite this, during the 1942 World Series, he led all Cardinals' hitters in batting average with .300 en route to their World Series victory.\nBrown enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces after playing 34 games during the season. When World War II ended, his contract was sold for $30,000 on January 5, 1946, to the Pittsburgh Pirates; he played the season as a utility infielder before being released by the Pirates on November 15.\nIn 890 games over eight seasons, Brown posted a .279 batting average (980-for-3512) with 465 runs, 146 doubles, 42 triples, 9 home runs, 319 RBI and 231 bases on balls. He finished his career with a .959 fielding percentage playing at second and third base and shortstop. In the 1942 World Series, he hit .300 (6-for-20) with 2 runs, 1 RBI and 3 walks.\nUpon retirement, he became a manager in the Pittsburgh farm system, with the Indianapolis Indians in 1947 and the New Orleans Pelicans in 1948. Brown then returned to the National League as a coach for the Boston Braves, working for three seasons (1949–51) under his old Cardinal skipper, Billy Southworth.\nLater life.\nAfter leaving Boston in 1952, he was a manager for minor league teams in the farm systems of the Cardinals, Braves and Cincinnati Reds. He died December 29, 1977, in Bath, North Carolina."

        "title": "Cycling at the 1952 Summer Olympics – Men's individual road race",
        "text": "The men's individual road race at the 1952 Summer Olympics was held on 2 August, the 2nd last day of the Olympics on an 11,2 km course running counter-clockwise from Käpylä through Pakila and Maunula and back to Käpylä. The course was circled seventeen times, so the total length of the competition was 190,4 km. About half of the road was hard-surfaced, the other half sand-surfaced. There were 154 entries from 31 nations and 111 participants from 30 nations. Each nation could enter up to four cyclists; nations entering at least three cyclists had the scores of their best three finishers summed for the team road race event. The individual event was won by André Noyelle of Belgium, the nation's first victory in the men's individual road race. His teammate Robert Grondelaers took silver. Edi Ziegler earned Germany's first medal in the event since 1896 with his bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the fourth appearance of the event, previously held in 1896 and then at every Summer Olympics since 1936. It replaced the individual time trial event that had been held from 1912 to 1932 (and which would be reintroduced alongside the road race in 1996). France had won the last two Olympic road races. Gianni Ghidini of Italy was the 1951 world champion.\nJapan, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Vietnam each made their debut in the men's individual road race. Great Britain made its fourth appearance in the event, the only nation to have competed in each appearance to date.\nCompetition format and course.\nThe mass-start race was on a course that covered 17 laps of an 11.2 kilometres circuit on Koskelantie Street in Käpylä, for a total of 190.4 kilometres. The course was \"not overly difficult in terms of climbs, but had few flat sections, consisting of rolling hills throughout.\" Lapped cyclists were eliminated and could not finish.\nResults.\nMårtensson made an early attack, taking a 45-second lead during lap 6, but was caught by the peloton in lap 8. By halfway, there was a clear lead group of nine cyclists. The Belgian riders Noyelle, Grondelaers, and Victor broke away during lap 11, with Ziegler and Maenan joining them. Maenan fell away from the front pack at lap 14. Noyelle made his break at the start of lap 17, taking an easy lead to win the race. Grondelaers separated from the other two remaining leaders with five kilometres to go, taking silver. The bronze came down to a sprint between Ziegler and Victor, with the German winning to prevent a Belgian medal sweep.\nBehind the lead pack, a bad crash in lap 9 resulted in about 20 cyclists falling, with many unable to continue due to damage to their bicycles. The remaining second group of 11 cyclists continued until lap 15, when Bruni separated into clear fifth place and the other 10 cyclists finished close together."

        "title": "WTBA World Tenpin Bowling Championships",
        "text": "The World Tenpin Bowling Championships is a global event that invites all countries that are members of International Bowling Federation to participate. \nEvent details and history.\nThe first World Championships was in 1954, held in Helsinki where 58 men from 7 federations took part. The next three World Championships (1955, 1958, and 1960) only had men participating. Women first participated in the 1963 World Championships in Mexico City. From 1963 to 2003, the World Championships were conducted every fourth year. \nCurrent Championships.\nAs a result of the expanding number of federations competing, it was agreed in 2001 to divide the two genders in World Championships beginning in 2005. This affected the schedules for the following two 4 years cycles as follows:\nWorld Championships for both genders were reintroduced in 2009 after a World Congress resolved to hold them every fourth year. In 2013, the inaugural edition of these so-called Combined World Championships took place. The number of teams allowed to compete in the Combined World Championships is limited to 36 teams per gender, one of which is the host federation's team, and the other 35 federations are chosen from the Zones based on the number of federations in each zone as of the qualifying date. \nThe following are the most recent four-year World Championship cycles:\nThe above-mentioned four-year cycles will be repeated for the 2022-2025 cycles, and so on.\nFormat of the games and disciplines through the years.\nfrom 1954.\nThe format for the championships has changed many times throughout its history. In the early years of the championships, men competed in four different categories: Doubles, 4-man team, 8-man team and masters. Up until 1963 women did not participate in the event. The first year that women did take part, they competed in 4 different categories, doubles, four-person team (European Style), four-person team (American Style) and masters. This is the only time the \"European Style\" has been used in the championships. In the following championships the European style four-person team was replaced with the five-person team event (American Style) and was used until 1979. \nCurrent format and disciplines.\nSingles, Doubles, Trios, Team of Five, All Events, and Masters have been the disciplines for both genders since 1979, with 6 women and 6 men on each team. The medalists for these events except the Masters from 1979 to 2007 were determined by total pinfall.\nAfter the conclusion of singles, doubles, trios, and five-person team events, the All Events medals are presented to the top three bowlers of both genders who have accumulated the most pinfall over the 24 games.\nAddition of Match-Play in the finals.\nBeginning in 2008, a medal round was introduced for singles, doubles, trios, and 5 five person team event. The Medal round consisted of the top four qualifiers playing a knockout format to determine the medalists (1 vs 4 and 2 vs 3, winners of those matches face each other in the final). \nThe masters event has only recently changed with the onset of the championships splitting into 2 different events. Up until 2005 the top 16 would bowl a 16-game Round Robin with the top 3 bowlers after the 16 games advancing through to a stepladder final. From 2005 to 2011, the masters was played using the matchplay style, best of 5 format. \nFrom 2013-2015, the top 24 men and women in All-Events advanced to the Masters event. All players will bowl six games with the All-Events total carried forward. The top 8 after 30 games advance to seven games of round robin match play, where 20 bonus points are awarded for a won match and 10 bonus points for a tied match. The top 4 advance to the semifinals, which is a one-game match, 1 vs 4 and 2 vs 3. The semifinal losers will earn a bronze medal. The semifinal winners advance to a one-game final match to determine gold and silver medals. In 2017, the masters format (still consisting of top 24 men and women) reverted to matchplay style, best of 3.\nModification in Team Event.\nBeginning in 2017, the five-person team event was modified. Qualifying was still all five players bowl ten frames each with their scores added together to determine the overall score. In the medal round, the five players bowl a best of 3 baker format, where players bowl in order one frame each (frames 1-5) and repeat the order from frames 6-10. \nDual pattern lane condition format.\nIn 2005 the World Championships adopted the \"dual pattern format\" lane conditions. The two patterns are chosen from a bank of oil patterns certified by World Bowling. These oil patterns are classified as \"short\", \"medium\", and \"long\". Each bowler at the championships will bowl an equal number of games on the two patterns. In the masters, each match is played on alternating lane patterns with the highest seed having the choice of which pattern to start on.\nThe concept of having two different lane patterns is to force the bowlers to be more versatile in the championships. The two different lane patterns force the bowlers to attack each pattern from different angles, using different styles of play, such as ball speed, hand position and ball choice. It has been argued that in previous championships around the world, using one pattern for the whole event would suit certain bowlers over others, which was deemed as being unfair. It was agreed that having two different lane conditions would be a fairer way of determining the best bowlers at the championships. Many other championships around the world have also adopted this format, such as the Men's and Women's European Championships, the Asian Games, the World Ranking Masters, The Commonwealth Championships and the Asian Championships. World Bowling announced in December 2015 only one lane pattern will be used for the entirety of future World Championships, ending the dual pattern format.\nChampionships.\nWorld Bowling Executive Board have awarded the 2021 Combined World Championships hosting rights to Kuwait. Hong Kong will host the Men's World Championships in 2018, and Las Vegas will host the Women's World Championships in 2019.\nA new event, WTBA World Singles Championships for men and women, was held for the first time in Limassol, Cyprus from September 18–26, 2012, and will be held subsequently every four years. With this new event, WTBA will stage a World Championship event every year.\nMedals history.\nMedals:\nWomen's medal table.\nAs of 2019.\nMen's medal table.\nAs of 2018.\nTotal medal table.\nAs 2019\nMedal winners.\nPlease see List of WTBA World Tenpin Bowling Championships medalists."

        "title": "The Mystery of Chess Boxing",
        "text": "The Mystery of Chess Boxing (; also known as Ninja Checkmate) is a 1979 Hong Kong kung fu film written, produced and directed by Joseph Kuo and starring Mark Long, Jack Long and Lee Yi Min.\nPlot.\nLee Yi Min stars as a young boy, Ah Pao, who wants to learn kung fu so that he can avenge his father's death at the hands of the Ghost Faced Killer. The Ghost Faced Killer meanwhile is hunting down a number of clan leaders who all conspired to have him killed. Before attacking, the killer always throws down his \"ghost face killing plate,\" a decorated metal plate with a red face. He then uses his distinctive five elements style.\nAh Pao attends a local kung fu school (The Chang Sing School), but is bullied by the seniors. However, the school's cook (Yuen Siu Tien) helps the boy and teaches him some moves after challenging Ah Pao to steal one grain of rice from the Chef's bowl. He succeeds only in cheating and waiting for the Master to finish his meal. The chef then teaches Ah Pao some kung fu but admits that he will never be good enough. He tells him, \"When the time comes to go, I'll tell you where to go all right.\" He proves to be adequate for his day-to-day living but cannot fulfill his deep desire for revenge. When Ah Pao is found in possession of the Ghost Faced Killer's symbol, he is expelled from school. While he leaves in exile, his teacher is forced to shut the school down in fear of his students being killed. After the students leave, the Teacher is killed by the Ghost Faced Killer. Still wishing to learn kung fu, he turns to an old \"xiangqi\" (also known as Chinese chess) master Chi Sue Tin, recommended by the cook, for training. The master is an old enemy of the Ghost Faced Killer who reveals his former identity: he was a former kung fu chief who held sway over the area with his fellow fighters, but he was forced to go into hiding after being badly injured in a fight and also coming under scrutiny by the Ghost Faced Killer. Chi Sue agrees to teach Lee his chess boxing kung fu.\nAh Pao finally learns the strategic link between chess and kung fu. He and Chi Sue Tin team up using double horse style, a reference to \"xiangqi\", and they defeat the Ghost Faced Killer.\nReception.\nIn the 1995 book \"The Encyclopedia of Martial Arts Movies\", authors Bill Palmer, Karen Palmer and Richard Meyers gave the film a score of three-and-a-half out of four stars. Though criticizing the distribution title \"Ninja Checkmate\" on the grounds of there not being any ninjas depicted in the film, they wrote, \"What you will see are great training scenes and forms. Though some frames have been cut to enhance the fights and some wires are used, the martial arts and choreography are fantastic.\"\nIn popular culture.\nThe Wu-Tang Clan song \"Da Mystery of Chessboxin, which appears on their 1993 album \"Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)\", derives its title from \"The Mystery of Chess Boxing\". Additionally, Wu-Tang Clan member Ghostface Killah derived his stage name from the film's villain, the Ghost-Faced Killer.\nDJ Hazard's song \"Killers Don't Die\" samples the American dubbed soundtrack from this film."

        "title": "HRT Formula 1 Team",
        "text": "HRT Formula 1 Team, formerly known as Campos Meta 1 and Hispania Racing, was a Spanish Formula One team founded by former driver Adrián Campos. It was sold to José Ramón Carabante before its debut in 2010, and then to investment group Thesan Capital in July 2011. It was the first Spanish team to race in Formula One; a previous effort known as \"Bravo F1\" failed to enter the sport in .\nIn November 2012, HRT's owners announced that they were looking to sell the team. When they were unable to find a buyer before the deadline of 30 November, the team was subsequently omitted from the entry list.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nThe team began as a collaboration between Adrián Campos of Campos Racing and Enrique Rodríguez of Meta Image, under the name of Campos Meta. Campos Racing currently runs a team in the European F3 Open Championship and used to run the GP2 Series team known as Addax Team. Campos was running the Formula One operation in conjunction with Meta Image, a Madrid-based sports agency, who managed one of Campos' F3 Open drivers at the time, Bruno Méndez. Campos and Rodríguez began looking at the possibility of creating Spain's first Formula One team in February 2009. In March, the team gained shareholders such as Spanish businessman José Ramón Carabante and basketball players Pau Gasol and Jorge Garbajosa.\nThe team's headquarters were originally located at Meta Images's offices in Madrid, housing marketing and administration, while its technical centre is located at Campos Racing's headquarters in Alzira, Valencia. In October 2009 the team completed a deal with the local government of the Region of Murcia to build new facilities for the team at the Parque Tecnológico Fuente Álamo science park. Italian constructor Dallara built the 2010 cars in Parma, which used Cosworth engines.\nOn 12 June, Campos Meta were named by the FIA as one of three new teams granted entry to the 2010 season, along with US F1 Team and Manor Grand Prix.\nOn the weekend of the 2009 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Campos confirmed that Bruno Senna, the nephew of former world champion Ayrton Senna, would be one of their racing drivers for 2010.\nFinancial struggles and rebranding.\nOn 22 December 2009, Bernie Ecclestone voiced concerns about the team's ability to be on the grid for the first race of the 2010 F1 season. In January 2010, A1 Grand Prix principal Tony Teixeira was one of several potential investors linked to the team in an effort to open up a revenue stream in the build-up to the 2010 testing season. Teixeira, who had previously been rumoured as a potential buyer of Honda at the end of has stated his intentions to make Campos the Formula One \"arm\" of the struggling A1 Grand Prix series. On 27 January, the team admitted that they may not be able to participate in the 2010 winter testing season at all and that their second driver may not be announced until the eve of their first race. Despite this admission, Teixeira claimed the team was aiming to make the second test session and believed that they would \"definitely\" make the third session at Jerez. However, it was reported in early February that Teixeira's proposed buy-out of the team was being met with resistance from the established teams.\nOn 5 February 2010, Campos boss Adrián Campos told BBC Sport that the team were struggling to find funding. It was paying the €7 million to Dallara stating that \"sometime we have the money sometime we don't\". He confirmed that the funding should be finalised and within place the following week. He also denied the fact that F1-hopefuls Stefan GP had taken the Campos' car stating that \"we've got a contract and as long as we're paying the contract is valid\". Later in February, speculation began to spread as to whether Campos would actually make the 2010 field, and the team admitted budgetary problems.\nOn 19 February, it was announced that majority shareholder José Ramón Carabante had taken over full control of the team from Adrián Campos, who was also replaced as team principal by Colin Kolles. The team was renamed to Hispania Racing F1 Team (HRT) ahead of their first race, with the name taken from Grupo Hispania, one of Carabante's companies. The team's headquarters were moved from Meta Image's offices in Madrid to Grupo Hispania's offices in Murcia. On 4 March, Karun Chandhok was confirmed as the team's second driver. The team launched their Cosworth-powered, Dallara-designed car later the same day; it was called the F110.\n2010 season.\nWith no pre-season testing, the F110 completed its first laps during the weekend of the 2010 Bahrain Grand Prix. Senna's car was completed in time for him to complete three installation laps in the first free practice session. In the second session, he completed 17 laps, setting a best time over 11 seconds off the pace, but slid off the road after completing his final lap due to one of his car's wheels coming loose. Senna described the day's work as a \"great start\", considering the team's lack of preparation. By contrast, the mechanics were unable to make the clutch and gearbox on Chandhok's car work, and he did not complete any laps on Friday. In qualifying, Senna and Chandhok set the 23rd and 24th-quickest times to share the back row of the starting grid: Chandhok was finally able to complete his car's first laps in anger and set a time 1.7 seconds slower than his team-mate, who was in turn just over eight seconds behind polesitter Sebastian Vettel. For the race, both cars started from the pit lane; Chandhok crashed out on the second lap and Senna retired on lap 18 with an overheating engine.\nAt the , the cars again occupied the back row of the grid, with Senna ahead of Chandhok. The F110s were both 6.6 seconds off the polesitter's time, but only 0.34 seconds behind the Virgin of Lucas di Grassi. Senna's car only lasted four laps of the race before retiring with a hydraulic failure, but Chandhok finished 14th and last for the car's first classified finish, albeit five laps adrift of winner Jenson Button and three laps behind Heikki Kovalainen's 13th-placed Lotus. This was partly due to a damaged floor caused by Chandhok coming off the track twice during the race.\nHispania recorded its first double finish at the with Chandhok finishing in front of Senna, albeit 3 and 4 laps down respectively. The team repeated this feat at the with Senna in 16th and Chandhok 17th, the last of the cars still running.\nThe fifth start in Spain wasn't so successful for both Hispania drivers. Senna retired in the first corner after an accident, Chandhok remained on the track for 30 laps, then retired with a broken suspension. However the team's new test driver Christian Klien drove for the team in first practice.\nHispania started well in Monaco, leapfrogging their rivals (Lotus and Virgin) at the start of the race. Senna later retired, but Chandhok was looking set to finish until he was involved in a frightening accident with Jarno Trulli who, when trying to overtake Chandhok, hit the side of the Hispania car and was sent over the top of it and into the barrier. Both drivers were unhurt. The crash almost cost Mark Webber the race win as he was following the pair closely when the accident occurred.\nIn Turkey, the team's other test driver Sakon Yamamoto completed the first practice session, setting the slowest time of the session.\nOn the eve of the at Silverstone, Hispania announced that Bruno Senna had been dropped for the race, and that test driver Sakon Yamamoto would take his place. However, it was announced that Senna would race after Silverstone, saying that they \"want to confirm that Bruno Senna has all the support of the Spanish team\" and \"that he remains one of the Hispania Racing HRT F1 team's official drivers and that he will be continuing to drive in the remaining races.\" Yamamoto replaced Chandhok for the next four races, before being replaced by Christian Klien for the due to food poisoning. Yamamoto returned for the following two races, but was again replaced by Klien for the final two races of the season.\nIn 2020, Chandhok claimed that the battle between Campos and Dallara over the chassis payment led to the teams' launch car being raced all season without any upgrades. As a result, the only alteration made to the cars all year was the movement of side-mirrors inboard ahead of a sidepod-mirror ban in China.\n2011 season.\nHispania parted company with Dallara in May 2010 after the partnership between the two companies had become tense due to the car's lack of performance. The team sought an alternative technical deal to assist in the construction of its chassis. When Hispania was still under the Campos name, team owner José Ramón Carabante said in an interview with Autosport that Campos Meta F1/HRT were eyeing a Ferrari engine supply for the season. Colin Kolles said in an interview with Diario AS in July 2010, that talks about a partnership with Toyota was an option for 2011. Kolles confirmed in October that the team had enough financing to complete its maiden Formula One campaign.\nFormer chief executive officer of Telefónica, Juan Villalonga joined the team in November 2010. His main role is to help with communications, technology and sponsorship. It was later announced that the team would give a test to GP2 champion Pastor Maldonado who later secured a drive with Williams. Fellow GP2 drivers Josef Král and Davide Valsecchi also tested for the team in Abu Dhabi. After the final race of the 2010 season, it emerged that Hispania had signed a deal in the summer of 2010 with Toyota Motorsport GmBH which would have seen it use Toyota's never-raced 2010 car, the Toyota TF110, as the basis of its 2011 challenger as well as making use of Toyota Motorsport's technical resources. In November 2010, Toyota announced that they had cancelled the agreement because HRT failed to make payments. In December 2010 there were reports that the team has been placed up for sale, but had been denied by its owners. Hispania also left the Formula One Teams Association at this point, blaming the organisation's bias against the smaller teams for its decision. The FOTA secretary-general, however, claimed that Hispania was expelled from the organisation because it did not pay its 2010 membership fee.\nOn 6 January, Narain Karthikeyan announced that he would drive for Hispania in the 2011 season. He previously drove for the Jordan team in . By February, it had emerged that the team was considering Vitantonio Liuzzi as an option for their second driver. Liuzzi confirmed that it was in consideration and took part in the third pre-season test with the team, in Barcelona. The team also tested former Formula Renault V6 Eurocup champion Giorgio Mondini at Barcelona. Liuzzi was confirmed as Hispania's second driver on 9 March 2011.\nThe team's 2011 car, the Hispania F111 made its debut during the second practice session of the , with Vitantonio Liuzzi completing an installation lap three minutes before the end of the session. The 2011 season saw the re-introduction of the 107% rule, and in qualifying, both drivers failed to score a time under the 107% of the pole. In Malaysia, the team showed improved pace, with Liuzzi only half a second from the slowest of the Virgin cars. Both cars were within 107% of the polesitter's time, and were thus able to take the start of the race. However both cars retired with technical problems. In China, Liuzzi and Karthikeyan qualified again, and completed the race as the last two classified finishers in 22nd and 23rd respectively.\nIn Turkey, Liuzzi started the race in front of both Virgins, but finished 22nd thanks to brake problems, with Karthikeyan in 21st. Spain saw both cars starting ahead of Jérôme d'Ambrosio, but meanwhile Karthikeyan finished 21st, Liuzzi retired with gearbox problems; in Monaco, both drivers crashed in practice and did not enter qualifying, but were allowed to start the race by the stewards. Liuzzi finished 16th and Karthikeyan 17th, taking advantage of multiple retirements. In Canada, the team achieved their best result with both drivers finishing in 13th and 14th positions, placing them ahead of Virgin in the Constructors' Championship. However, Karthikeyan was hit with a post race penalty for cutting a chicane during the race, which dropped him to 17th place. At Valencia, Liuzzi and Karthikeyan finished 23rd and 24th.\nOn 4 July 2011, it was announced that Thesan Capital, a Madrid-based investment company purchased a controlling stake in the team from owner Jose Ramon Carabante. Thesan Capital announced the team's operations would continue as they had before the purchase, and that they had no plans to change the team name or alter its operational structure. In a statement released to the media, Thesan Capital described their intentions as making the team \"more Spanish\" and settling the team within Spain.\nFor the , Karthikeyan was replaced by Red Bull protégé Daniel Ricciardo. He qualified 24th with Liuzzi in 23rd, and they finished 19th and 18th respectively. Ricciardo again finished 19th in Germany, while Liuzzi retired. In Hungary, Liuzzi finished 20th and Ricciardo 18th. Despite not setting a time within 107% of the best time in Q1, both cars were allowed to race in Belgium. Liuzzi finished 19th and Ricciardo retired with a vibration in his car. In Italy, Liuzzi lost control at the start after making contact with Kovalainen, slid across the grass, cut the first corner and slammed sideways in to Vitaly Petrov and Nico Rosberg, taking all three out of the race.\nOn 22 October 2011, a few days before the inaugural Indian Grand Prix, Hispania announced that Karthikeyan would drive in place of Liuzzi rather than Ricciardo. Despite picking up damage in the first lap of the race, Karthikeyan managed to beat Ricciardo by 31.8 seconds in the race to finish 17th. Liuzzi returned to replace Karthikeyan for the final two races.\nHispania finished 11th in the World Constructors' Championship, ahead of Virgin.\n2012 season.\nOn 21 November 2011, it was announced that Pedro de la Rosa had signed for the team on a two-year contract. On 14 December 2011, the team announced that team principal Colin Kolles was leaving, effective from the following day, \"due to the new direction that the team has taken and the decision of the new management to move the team headquarters to Spain\". He was replaced by Luis Pérez-Sala.\nIn February 2012 it was announced that the team would move its operations to the Caja Mágica complex in Madrid, using 11,000 square metres. The team's car, the F112, was originally scheduled to complete its first running during the second pre-season test in Barcelona in late February, but was delayed due to the car failing mandatory crash tests. At the , de la Rosa and Karthikeyan were not permitted to race, as both drivers failed to set a lap time within 107% of the fastest time in the first part of qualifying.\nOn 12 November 2012, the team's owner Thesan Capital confirmed that they were in talks with several parties in regard to the sale of the Spanish outfit.\nTeam closure.\nIn November 2012, the owners of HRT F1 announced that they were putting the team up for sale. The team needed to find a buyer by 30 November – the date by which entry fees for the 2013 were due to be paid – or else face closure and a departure from the sport. HRT failed to find a buyer in time, and the team was omitted from the 2013 entry list. They were later reported to be in liquidation. Despite bids to purchase and revive the team under a new name, their assets were ultimately sold to Teo Martín, owner of a firm specialising in recycling automotive parts. Martín intends to race the cars in the EuroBOSS Series.\nCzech driver Josef Král later stated that he had signed a contract to race for the Spanish team if it had made the grid for 2013."

He made his league debut on 26 September 1981, just weeks after his 17th birthday, against local rivals Nottingham. He enjoyed seven successful years at the All-Stars (now known as Riders) before moving south to sign for Bracknell Tigers in 1988.\nAfter nine years as a player, James was then promoted head coach of the Tigers in 1997, a position he retained until 2005 when the franchise was pulled from the league. However, he was soon offered the coaching position of Guildford Heat, a club established by fans of the former Tigers to take their place in the BBL. In just two seasons, James led the new franchise to fifth place in their rookie season and a League and Cup double in 2007, an achievement for the club, for which he was awarded BBL Coach of the Year 2007. The proceeding season saw James lead the Heat into its first European adventure, competing in the ULEB Cup, however a disappointing campaign finished 0-10 in a Group that contained the likes of DKV Joventut, Alba Berlin and BC Šiauliai.\nThe 2008-2009 season was one of financial struggle for Guildford, and as a cost-cutting measure confirmed that James's contract would not be renewed at the end of the season.

He has also held a variety of collegiate assistant coaching positions.\nEarly life.\nSeymour is a graduate of Bridgewater State University in Bridgewater, Massachusetts. He holds a bachelor of science degree in physical education from the school. Following his graduation from Bridgewater State, Seymour spent eight years teaching high school, and coached a girl's high school basketball team to two New Hampshire state titles.\nCoaching career.\nIn 1986, Seymour was hired as a part-time assistant basketball coach at Saint Anselm College in Goffstown, New Hampshire. He became a full-time assistant in 1989. In 1991, Bill Herrion left an assistant coaching position George Washington to take-over as head coach at Drexel. Herrion added Seymour to his staff upon his arrival at Drexel, as the two had gotten to know one another on the recruiting trail. During Seymour's eight-season tenure on Herrion's staff, the Dragons won 167 games, won the America East Conference regular season title four times, the America East Conference tournament three times, made three NCAA tournament appearances (including the program's first tournament win as a Division I program in 1996), and made one appearance in the NIT.\nFollowing the 1998-99 season, Herrion left Drexel to take-over as head coach at East Carolina. Seymour was immediately tapped to succeed Herrion. He was fired by the university on March 7, 2001, following the completion of his second season as head coach.

Reaction to Seymour's firing was generally negative in the Philadelphia area. He was succeeded as Drexel's head coach by Bruiser Flint, who had recently resigned as head coach at UMass. Seymour's termination coincided with Drexel's departure from the America East Conference, and joining of the Colonial Athletic Association.\nSeymour originally interviewed for a position on Jim Baron's staff at Rhode Island, before eventually being hired by Siena.

        "text": "Jimmy White's 'Whirlwind' Snooker is a video game designed and produced by Archer Maclean, released by Virgin Games in 1991 for the Amiga, Atari ST, and IBM PC compatibles (later for the Mega Drive). A port for the Atari Lynx was planned but never released. \"'Whirlwind' Snooker\" is a realistic snooker simulator.\nAlthough the game was not the first to simulate snooker (or pool) in 3D, it used the processing power and graphics capabilities of 16-bit home computers and was praised for its then ground-breaking realism and easy-to-use interface. \"ACE\" said that the game was the closest thing to being on a real snooker table which existed at the time, and it could be used by a player to refine real-life snooker skills.\nGameplay.\nDespite being an accurate and serious simulation of the sport, Maclean's irreverent sense of humour was prominent throughout. The sound effect used for a successful was a resounding \"pop\" (regardless of the speed at which the ball reached the pocket) and numerous animations provided comic relief should a player take more than a few seconds to shoot. Balls would sprout eyeballs and arms, making faces at the player or holding up signs that read \"Get on with it!\" and such.\nAlso present is an extensive trick shot editor, featuring a number of pre-set table arrangements with instructions on how they should be played. An easter egg enabled the option to watch the computer player complete a maximum break. The game's title music was similar to (and probably intended to pay homage to) that of snooker TV programme \"Pot Black\".\nThe game uses a copy protection mechanism in which the user is prompted to enter a word from the manual corresponding to a certain page, paragraph and word number. Getting this word wrong three times caused the word FAIL to appear over the screen many times (after which, in the MS-DOS version, the computer was rebooted).\nDevelopment.\nThe game took Maclean several years to complete; the billiard ball physics alone taking several months of programming. One of the reasons why the game runs as quickly as it does is the way in which each is played. The next shot is effectively pre-played while the is being – the position and movement of each ball being calculated frame-by-frame and kept in a list in memory.\nEach frame of the next shot is then displayed by rendering each ball from this list, frame-by-frame, instead of rendering it in real-time. Maclean also explained that a closed environment like a snooker table allowed certain optimizations that would not be possible in 3D games such as Elite.\nRelease.\nFollowing the game's release, Virgin launched a nationwide tournament in the UK. Regional heats were held at Virgin's stores; the eventual winner went on to challenge Maclean himself in the first series of Channel 4's \"GamesMaster\" with snooker pro Jimmy White commentating. The game itself would also appear on two further episodes of GamesMaster, with John Parrott appearing on the second series, and Jimmy White himself playing the game in Series 4.\nReception.\nReception for the game was generally positive. UK magazine \"Mean Sega Machines\" scored the game highly, with 92%, particularly enjoying the game's pick-up and play controls, and the accurate portrayal of snooker, saying \"JWWS brings simulation into the 90s, and is destined to be the benchmark other sims are measured by.\"\nIn 1994, \"PC Gamer UK\" named \"Whirlwind Snooker\" the 37th best computer game of all time. In 2017, Gamesradar ranked the game 45th on their \"Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time.\"\nLegacy.\nThe game was followed by \"Archer Maclean's Pool\" in 1992, \"\" in 1999 and \"Jimmy White's Cueball World\" in 2001."

        "title": "Shagging (baseball)",
        "text": "In baseball, shagging is the act of catching fly balls in the outfield outside the context of an actual baseball game. This is most commonly done by pitchers during batting practice before a game, where they assist their hitting teammates by catching or picking up their batted baseballs and throwing them back to the pitching area in the infield. Batboys also help shagging, and it is reportedly considered a great honor among batboys to be asked to do this. This pre-game activity is widely disliked by pitchers, who argue that it does not benefit them at all, since it drains their energy and actually increases the risk of stiffness in the lower back and leg as a result of prolonged standing. In response to these claims, several teams have exempted pitchers from having to shag. In the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) league, teams pay groups specifically assembled to shag fly balls in place of pitchers, and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim recruit local firefighters in Arizona to do the job when the team plays in the Cactus League during spring training.\nDangers.\nAlthough shagging is not considered to be dangerous, several freak injuries have occurred as a result of engaging in it. In 1943, just one season after collecting his 3,000th hit, Paul Waner accidentally gashed his foot while shagging a fly ball in a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, his former team. This was probably due to Waner being nearsighted and his refusal to wear glasses; thus, he \"played the outfield by ear.\" Nearly four decades later, Jerry Reuss was handed the honor of pitching on Opening Day in 1981, but suffered an injury to his calf while shagging for his teammates. He was replaced by unheralded rookie Fernando Valenzuela, who went on to win his next 8 consecutive decisions.\nOther players who have suffered serious injuries due to shagging include Mark Fidrych and Brendan Donnelly. Fidrych suffered a left knee injury after tearing cartilage in 1977 spring training, starting a downward spiral in his career. Donnelly ended up breaking his nose while shagging, resulting in him losing half of his blood and necessitating three operations.\nMariano Rivera, the all-time leader in saves, suffered arguably the most well-known injury from shagging on May 3, 2012. While helping out in pre-game batting practice, Rivera attempted to catch a fly ball from Jayson Nix when he twisted his knee on the warning track of Kauffman Stadium and fell to the ground. An MRI scan revealed he had torn his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and part of his meniscus. This prematurely ended his season and led to fears that this could potentially be a career-ending injury. Rivera was able to come back and pitch for the 2013 season, his final season in the major leagues before retiring.\nDespite the seriousness of Rivera's injuries, pitchers from across Major League Baseball (MLB) who engaged in shagging flies during batting practice said they would not drop the activity or modify their training routine. These included James Shields and J. J. Putz, along with 2012 Cy Young Award winners R. A. Dickey and David Price. Furthermore, several MLB managers at the time—namely Dale Sveum, Joe Maddon, Jim Leyland and Terry Collins—confirmed they would not order their pitchers to stop shagging."

He was formerly head coach at Duquesne University, Murray State University and Southeast Missouri State University.\nEarly life and education.\nEdgar graduated from Penn Hills High School in Penn Hills, Pennsylvania. At the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown, Edgar played basketball and baseball. He graduated from Pittsburgh–Johnstown in 1978 with a bachelor's degree in sociology.\nCoaching career.\nEdgar first coached at New Mexico Military Institute in 1978. Nolan Richardson hired him as one of his first assistants at the University of Tulsa in 1980, his first position in Division I. Edgar followed Richardson to Arkansas in 1985 and continued as Richardson's assistant until getting his first head coaching position at Murray State in 1991. He led the Racers to two NCAA tournament appearances in four seasons.\nIn 1995, Edgar accepted the head coaching position at Duquesne. He was unable to turn the Duquesne Dukes around, however, and was let go after three seasons. From 1999 to 2001, Edgar was director of basketball operations at TCU under Billy Tubbs. Edgar returned to coaching in 2002 at UAB under Mike Anderson, where he helped UAB qualify for the 2003 NIT quarterfinals and 2004 NCAA tournament Sweet 16. In the 2005–06 season, Edgar was on Bruce Pearl's staff on a Tennessee team that won the Southeast Conference East Division title.\nOn April 13, 2006, Edgar was named head coach at Southeast Missouri State. This position brought him back to the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC), where he started with Murray State. Edgar had success in the OVC, with a 65-27 conference record, winning three regular season championships, two tournament championships, and two coach of the year awards, all with Murray State University.\nOn October 9, 2008, Southeast Missouri State fired athletic director Don Kaverman and suspended Edgar after the NCAA notified the university of possible major violations, three months after both the men's and women's basketball programs were placed on two years' probation by the NCAA. On December 31, 2008, new athletic director John Shafer fired Edgar and bought out the final two years of Edgar's contract. The NCAA investigation concluded in August 2009 and found that impermissible tuition payments and violations of rules about summer conditioning activities and observing pickup games happened under Edgar's watch; Edgar's appeal was rejected in June 2010.\nHe was named men's basketball head coach at Eastern Oklahoma State College, a junior college, in the spring of 2010.\nHead coaching record.\nCollege.\nSources:"

The same day they looked at the property they made an offer and by late in 1987 they had an option for the property. Then in 1989 Pumpkin Ridge Partners was formed with French, Davis, and Barney Hyde. Next, in 1991 the group secured additional financing by bringing in Shigeru Ito as a 50-50 partner. The Japanese investor from Nagoya financed the $20 million golf club.\nIn August 1990, construction of the course began with American Golf Construction Company as the general contractor. The club opened on April 1, 1992, with the Ghost Creek course in operation. When Pumpkin Ridge opened, membership cost $37,500. The first hole-in-one recorded was by Bob Staab of Portland in June 1992. In September 1997 National Golf Properties purchased a 50 percent stake in the golf club and then leased the property to American Golf Corporation.\nIn 2003, the club had three of the top six best holes in the Portland area, including the best overall hole. LPGA hall of fame golfer Nancy Lopez named the 18th hole at Pumpkin Ridge in 1997's Women's U.S. Open her favorite hole in the world in 2005.

In 1996, Pumpkin Ridge hosted the men's U.S. Amateur, where 20-year-old Tiger Woods won his unprecedented third consecutive title on the Witch Hollow course and then turned professional, with Nike founder Phil Knight on hand. This event had the highest attendance in the history of the U.S. Amateur, with attendance for the week at 65,353 to watch Woods rally and win the final over Steve Scott on the 38th hole. The U.S. Women's Open was played at Witch Hollow in 1997 and 2003.\nThe U.S. Junior Amateur (boys') and Girls' Junior Championships were held at Pumpkin Ridge in 2000, contested on both courses with the finals at Ghost Creek. And in 2006, Witch Hollow hosted the U.S. Women's Amateur, where Kimberly Kim won the title as the youngest winner ever for that tournament.\nFrom 2009 to 2012, the Ghost Creek course hosted the Safeway Classic on the LPGA Tour, currently played in mid-August. In 2013, the tournament was moved back to Portland, played at Columbia Edgewater Country Club.\nBeginning in 2014, the Witch Hollow course has hosted the WinCo Foods Portland Open on the Korn Ferry Tour.\nIn 2022, Pumpkin Ridge hosted the second event of the controversial LIV Golf Invitational Series.\nGhost Creek Golf Course.\nThe Ghost Creek course was the first course to open, with play starting April 1, 1992. It was then named the best new public course in the country for the year by \"Golf Digest\". Later it was named as the fifth best public course by Golf magazine in 1996. For 2007-08 Golf Digest ranked it 68th in the country public golf courses. The par 71 Ghost Creek Course has won several other national awards. This Robert E. Cupp and John Fought designed golf course is 6,839 yards long. In Zagat's \"2006/07 Guide To America's Top Golf Courses\", the club's Ghost Creek course was named fourth most popular in the Northwest. On that same course the 14th hole was named one of the 100 toughest holes in golf in the book \"Golf's 100 Toughest Holes.\"\n&lt;br&gt;\nWitch Hollow Golf Course.\nIn 1992 when the Witch Hollow course opened, \"Golf Digest\" selected it as the second best new private course of the year.

        "text": "Steven Irwin (born 19 June 1983 in Queensland, Australia) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 2000s.\nCareer.\nWhile attending St. Lukes Anglican School, Irwin played for the Australian Schoolboys team in 2000.\nIrwin, affectionately nicknamed \"Croc\" after the late \"Crocodile Hunter\" of the same name, made a remarkable rise to first grade football in just 5 years. He spent much of his youth playing soccer before picking up Rugby League in 1997 at the age of 14.\nHe moved to the Canberra Raiders.\nIn 2010, it was revealed that Irwin was playing for Bundaberg in The Queensland competition.\nControversy.\nOn 18 May 2007, Irwin was with his teammate Todd Carney when Carney decided to drive in Irwin's ute, despite Carney having been disqualified from driving at the time. Police began to pursue the vehicle in a high-speed chase through the back streets of the Canberra suburb of Bruce. After turning into a dead-end street, Carney stopped the car and fled the scene on foot, leaving Irwin in the passenger seat. Irwin told police Carney was the driver.\nControversially, the Raiders club sacked Irwin over the incident (who was not charged with any offences), but retained Carney.\nOn 24 June 2007, Irwin lashed out at the Canberra Raiders club during a stinging interview in the \"Sunday Mail\" newspaper. He blamed the Raiders for ruining his career and his reputation."

It is organized by the Hellenic Basketball Federation (E.O.K.).\nHistory and format.\nThere were no official nation-wide Greek Cup competitions prior to the 1975–76 season. However, there was a precursor tournament to the Greek Cup, called the Attica State Cup, which was won by AEK Athens, in the 1966–67 and 1970–71 seasons. The first official Greek Cup took place during the 1975–76 season.\nFrom the 1994–95 to 2003–04 seasons, the Greek Cup tournament used a Final Four format. During that time, the Greek Cup competition format included a total of 62 teams; 14 from the top-tier level Greek Basket League, 16 from the 2nd-tier level Greek A2 Basket League, and 32 teams from the third-tier level Greek B Basket League.\nThrough the 2021–22 season, the top six placed teams from the previous season of the Greek Basket League had an automatic bye to the Greek Cup quarterfinals, while the other eight teams played in preliminary rounds for the other two quarterfinals places. The quarterfinals and onward rounds were played under a single elimination format.\nStarting with the 2022–23 Greek Cup tournament, the top seven placed teams of the top-tier level Greek Basket League's first half of the regular season, and the winners of the 2nd-tier level Greek UNICEF Cup, compete in a single elimination Final 8 format.\nTitles by city.\n6 clubs have won the Greek Basketball Cup. The 6 clubs that have won the Greek Basketball Cup all come from either the Thessaloniki or Athens urban areas, which are the two largest urban areas in the country of Greece.\nFinal Four (1994–2004 &amp; 2021–present).\nThe Final Four system was introduced in the 1994–95 season, and it was used until the 2003–04 season. It was used again in 2021–22 season, but without a 3rd place game.\nGreek Basketball Cup Finals Top Scorers and MVPs.\nSince the first Greek Cup in 1976, the Top Scorer of the Greek Cup Finals is given an award, regardless of whether he plays on the winning or losing team. Since 1995, a Finals MVP is also named at the conclusion of the Finals."

It was one of the most successful women's water polo teams in the world. It is currently organised into the Asia/Oceania regional group.\nHistory.\nThe Australia women's water polo team played their first international in 1975. Since that time they have gone from strength to strength. The team have often had to struggle with lack of funding, but despite that continued to perform credibly on the international stage.\nFollowing 6th place at the 1994 World Aquatics Championships in Rome, Italy, they won the women's Water polo World Cup at home in Sydney, Australia, in 1995. In 1996, the women won the silver medal in the Olympic Year Tournament behind the Netherlands, then finished with bronze in the following year's World Cup in Nancy, France. Australia continued their successful mid-1990s run by winning the bronze medal at the 1998 World Aquatics Championships in Perth, and remarkably over the rest of 1998 and 1999 were unbeatable, winning the four international tournaments they contested in the Netherlands, Italy, the United States and Hungary.\nAfter an incredible 14 month winning streak, they only managed the silver at the 1999 world cup in Winnipeg, Canada.\nAnother success came in 1997 when it was announced that women's Water polo would be included in the Olympic Games for the first time at their home Olympics in 2000 Summer Olympics.\nHaving had an excellent build up to the Sydney 2000, the team went into the first Olympic tournament at home. They lost one match to the powerful Dutch side in that historic campaign, on the way to winning their inaugural women's Olympic gold medal in front of an ecstatic home crowd.\nIn an incredible Olympic final, the evenly matched US and Australia sides were tied 3–3 with 1.3 seconds remaining on the clock, when Yvette Higgins blasted in a nine-metre shot from a free throw. The ball crossed the goal-line 0.2s from the final hooter to give Australia a 4–3 win, and the gold medal.\nThe Australia gold team medalists were: Naomi Castle, Jo Fox, Bridgette Gusterson (C), Simone Hankin, Kate Hooper, Yvette Higgins, Bronwyn Mayer, Gail Miller, Melissa Mills, Debbie Watson, Liz Weekes, Danielle Woodhouse, and Taryn Woods.\nThe team was brought back down to earth with an Olympic hangover in 2001, only managing 5th in the World Championships of that year. This dip in form was short lived, however, as they won the inaugural Commonwealth Water Polo Championships title in Manchester, England in 2002, beating world No 3 Canada 6–5 in the final.\nAustralia then suffered another lean patch, finishing 7th at the 2003 World Aquatics Championships in Barcelona, Spain, 4th at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, and 6th at the 2005 World Aquatics Championships in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\nThe team returned to successful ways by taking the bronze at the 2005 FINA Water Polo World League event in Kirishi, Russia, and at the 2007 Water polo world championship in Melbourne, Australia by taking the silver medal, after losing a hard fought final 5–6 to the US team.\nAt the 2008 Summer Olympics, the team took the bronze medal after beating Hungary for 3rd place in a penalty shootout.\nTeam.\nCurrent squad.\nRoster for the 2024 World Aquatics Championships.\nHead coach: Rebecca Rippon\nUnder-20 team.\nAustralia's women have won two titles at the FINA Junior Water Polo World Championships."

The maximum number of cyclists per nation was four. Fifty-eight cyclists finished the race. The event was won by Bernt Johansson of Sweden, the nation's first victory in the men's individual road race. Giuseppe Martinelli put Italy back on the podium with his silver; the nation had won gold or silver every Games from 1956 to 1968 but did not medal in 1972. Mieczysław Nowicki's bronze was Poland's first medal in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the 10th appearance of the event, previously held in 1896 and then at every Summer Olympics since 1936. It replaced the individual time trial event that had been held from 1912 to 1932 (and which would be reintroduced alongside the road race in 1996). Ryszard Szurkowski of Poland was \"probably\" the favorite; he had won the 1973 world championship and placed second in 1974. Neither the 1974 nor 1975 world champions competed in Montreal. \nBolivia and Nicaragua each made their debut in the men's individual road race. Great Britain made its 10th appearance in the event, the only nation to have competed in each appearance to date.\nCompetition format and course.\nThe mass-start race was on a 177.49 kilometre course \"over the hilly Mont-Royal Circuit\".\nResults.\nThe lead pack of 10 riders got clear during lap 6. Johansson broke away from the pack in the last lap for a clear win. In the final sprint by the remaining nine leaders, Thaler finished in front but was penalized for interfering with the other riders and demoted from second place to ninth (the back of the + 31\" group, with Alfonsel falling behind the rest into 10th place)."

It was created by the PGA Tour and showcases the World Golf Hall of Fame. In addition to the resort the World Golf Village features residential and commercial developments. There is also a census-designated place with the same name.\nDevelopment.\nThe parcel was approved in the 1990s as a \"Development of Regional Impact\" (DRI) under Section 380.06 of the Florida Statutes, and eventually have 18,000 residents. A new interchange on Interstate 95 in Florida was constructed to permit direct access to the site, which was expected to host a million visitors each year.\nKelly Lake was created at the center of the village, surrounded by a brick Walk of Champions, which features a large flagstone for each Hall of Fame member, with their name and signature etched in granite. A large building on the west side houses the hall of fame, theater, cafe and 110-foot shrine tower. The \"Shops of World Golf Village\" are situated on the north and east sides, and the Renaissance Hotel and convention center are to the south.\nWorld Golf Foundation.\nThe Ladies Professional Golf Association created a hall of fame in 1951. It was inactive until 1967, when it moved into a physical location in Augusta, Georgia and was renamed the LPGA Tour Hall of Fame. In the early 1990s, the PGA Tour was contemplating a Hall of Fame close to their north Florida headquarters. Deane Beman asked LPGA commissioner Charlie Mechem if there was interest in a joint Golf Hall of Fame. When they responded in the affirmative, the United States Golf Association was contacted, as was The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. Both agreed to collaborate, and PGA of America closed the Pinehurst World Golf Hall of Fame, while the LPGA decided to merge their HOF into the new facility.\nAn independent entity, the World Golf Foundation (WGF), was formed in 1994 to promote and honor the game and those who made significant contributions. The Board of Directors included representatives from the world's major golf organizations. The WGF owns and controls the World Golf Hall of Fame.\nHall of Fame.\nThe foremost attraction at World Golf Village is the World Golf Hall of Fame, which superseded the PGA of America facility at Pinehurst, North Carolina in May 1998. \nThe Hall of Fame has a permanent display with biographical information for every individual inducted. There are also sections devoted to the history of golf, heritage, organizations, course design, equipment, attire and trends. The Trophy Tower contains a collection of all the major tournament trophies (and many of the minor ones). Many of the displays are interactive and give the visitor a \"hands on\" experience. Featured exhibits change yearly, and a round on the 18-hole putting course is included with museum admission. Additionally, there is a Challenge Hole with an island green similar to the signature hole at TPC Sawgrass, the par 3, 17th.\nGolf.\nCourses.\nThe resort features two championship golf courses: the King &amp; Bear, designed jointly by Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus, and the Slammer &amp; Squire, a collaboration of Sam Snead and Gene Sarazen. Both courses consistently receive 4.5 stars rating (out of 5) by \"Golf Digest\". Both courses have hosted professional tournaments including the Liberty Mutual Legends of Golf, a Champions Tour event, and \"Shell's Wonderful World of Golf\", as well as other nationally televised events.\nAcademy.\nThe PGA TOUR Golf Academy opened at WGV in 2000 as a one-stop facility to help players improve all facets of their golf game. Their instructors are experienced PGA and LPGA professionals who provide clinics, schools, private lessons, development programs and camps for juniors using the latest technology.\nBased on the success of the program, branches have been established at TPC Sawgrass, TPC Scottsdale, TPC Las Vegas, TPC San Antonio and six other resort locations in the United States. The academy at World Golf Village trains and certifies all instructors at TOUR academies.\nAccommodations.\nFour hotels/motels were constructed in anticipation of tourism at the center. The largest is the Renaissance Resort at World Golf Village, followed by the Laterra Resort &amp; Spa. The Grande Villas and The Residences at World Golf Village also provide unique accommodations.\nAttractions.\nOne of the most popular attractions is the IMAX Theater, which plays the latest movies and documentaries in a 300-seat theater with an -wide by six-story-high screen.\nThe Murray Brothers Caddyshack restaurant is located along the Walk of Champions and is owned by actor Bill Murray and his five brothers. Their slogan is, \"Eat, Drink and Be Murray!\"\nVillagio Bar and Grill and a Starbucks are located within the Renaissance Resort. The Fairways Café is part of the World Golf Hall of Fame and offers casual and takeout fare.\nThe PGA Tour Stop (now closed) was situated along the Walk of Champions, and was the largest golf store in Florida.\nHistoric St. Augustine and the beaches of the Atlantic Ocean are nearby, and WGV is part of the Greater Jacksonville Metropolitan Area, with over 1 million residents.\nEducation.\nThe community is within the St. Johns County School District.\nZoned elementary schools include: Mill Creek Academy,\nPicolata Crossing, and Wards Creek.\nBoundaries of two middle schools include portions of World Golf Village: Mill Creek and Pacetti Bay:\nAll residents are zoned to Tocoi Creek High School.\nOther development.\nThe St. Johns County Convention Center was constructed within the WGV and is connected to the Renaissance Resort. \nWestminster St. Augustine, a Life Plan Community, is also located in WGV and offers Independent, Assisted, Skilled and Memory Care - all within the same gated campus. \nA \"Blue/Green\" timeshare resort with sales office is also within WGV.\nIndividual subdivisions exist within WGV which offer homes/homesites for those looking for an active Florida lifestyle within a golfing resort.

        "text": "John Dickson \"Dick\" McBride (June 14, 1847January 20, 1916) was an American Major League Baseball player from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who was the star pitcher and the player-manager for the Philadelphia Athletics of the National Association from 1871 through most of 1875 until Cap Anson took over as player-manager for the remaining eight games of the season. He had a pitching record of 149 wins and 74 losses during that period. In 1871, he went 18-5 and led Philadelphia to the NA championship. McBride finished his major league career in 1876 when he was signed by the Boston Red Stockings of the National League after the Association failed. He had a record of 0-4 before his career came to an end. McBride died in Philadelphia at the age of 70, and is interred at Lawnview Cemetery in Rockledge, Pennsylvania.\nIn 1864, while serving in the Union Army during the Civil War, he was allowed to take a 3-day furlough to participate in a series of baseball exhibitions between clubs from Brooklyn and the local Philadelphia clubs. It was during this time that the north's attention had turned to military defense, not baseball, so Brooklyn strategically scheduled these events hoping to take advantage of the situation to get some well sought after wins in \"enemy\" territory. The presence of McBride didn't do much, as all Philly teams were beaten soundly."

Owen Wister, the nephew of William, wrote what is considered the first true Western novel ever written, \"The Virginian\", the prototype for the first movie Western which came out as a silent movie in 1914 and has been filmed many times since that time.\nHistory.\nThe Newhall family joined with the Wister family founding the club in 1855 with the first games played on the Wisters' Belfield estate. The YACC team was largely responsible for keeping cricket going in Philadelphia during the Civil War. The YACC played at the Turnpike Bridge ground from 1858 to 1877 before moving to their new Stenton ground in 1879. The Germantown Cricket Club allowed YACC to share their Nicetown ground while their new ground was being prepared.\nWalter and Charles Newhall became famous YACC players. Walter Newhall scored his first century aged 12. Charles was the most successful bowler against the 1872 England team earning the respect W. G. Grace, England's greatest batsman. Before Bob Newhall captained Philadelphia's first touring team in England the YACC played the Toronto Cricket Club in Canada. Three generations (ten members) of the Newhall family played on the YACC from its founding in 1854 to its merging with the Germantown CC in 1890. The Newhalls also helped administer cricket in Philadelphia. George Newhall became editor of the \"American Cricketer\" which had a 52-year publication history from 1877 to 1929.\nYACC won the Halifax Cup in 1880, 1883 and 1885. The Halifax Cup won by a Philadelphia team in 1874 at Halifax in Nova Scotia became the social event of the year in Philadelphia from 1880 to 1926 by which time it was eclipsed by golf and tennis tournaments."

This was the 3rd West Indian tour following those of 1900 and 1906.\nThe early weather was disappointing and little useful practice was possible before the tour started. 3 of the first 5 matches were lost but the remainder of the tour was much more successful and only 4 of the remaining 23 matches were lost.\nBecause of the early poor results and the lack of representative matches public interest was rather limited.\nGeorge Challenor was by far the best batsman scoring twice as many runs as any other player at an average of over 50. He scored 6 of the 8 first class centuries scored by the team and 2 of the 3 in minor matches.\nGeorge Francis led the bowling with 82 first class wickets at an average of just over 15. George John, Cyril Browne and Victor Pascall also made useful contributions with the ball.\nThe fielding was generally regarded as of high standard with Learie Constantine's cover point fielding being particularly commented on.\nThe performances of the team were sufficiently well regarded by the experts of the time to pave the way for West Indies to be accepted into membership of the Imperial Cricket Conference and thereby attain Test Match status with effect from their next tour of England in 1928, in particular their reduction of a powerful H D G Leveson-Gore XI to 19-6 when requiring only 28 runs to win in the final match of the tour at Scarborough.\nTouring team.\nHarold Austin seems to have taken a large part in organising the tour after the 1922–23 Inter-Colonial Tournament in September 1922. He seems to have selected the Barbados, British Guiana and Trinidad tourists. Little was known of the Jamaica players and they were allocated just 3 places.\nThe 16 players that made up the team consisted of:\nDespite being 17 years since the last tour, two of the tourists, Austin and Challenor, had been part of the 1906 team. Learie Constantine was the son of Lebrun Constantine who had toured in 1900 and 1906. Victor Pascall was the uncle of Learie Constantine.\nR.H. Mallett was the manager. Austin was chosen as captain and Nunes as vice-captain.\nThe professionals Francis and John were black as were Browne, Constantine, Holt, Pascall and Small amongst the amateurs.\nPreliminaries.\nExcept for the Jamaica representatives the team sailed on the steamship \"Intaba\", which left British Guiana on 9 April and, sailing via Trinidad and Barbados, reached Southampton on 30 April. The Jamaican players had arrived two days earlier.\nThe players practised at Lord's and practice matches were arranged including a match against the Indian Gymkhana but the weather was very cold.\nMatches.\nStatus.\nOf the 28 matches 8 were not regarded as first-class. These were the matches against Durham, Northumberland, Cheshire, Wiltshire, Lord Harris's XI, Dublin University, Northern Cricket Union, and Norfolk. These are shown in \"italics\" below.\nSummary.\nOf the 20 first-class matches played, 6 matches were won, 7 were lost and 7 were drawn. In all matches 13 were won, 7 were lost and 8 were drawn.\nPost Tour.\nExcept for Jamaican players the team returned on board the steam ship \"Ingoma\" departing Southampton on 9 September and arriving in Barbados on the 21st.\nAverages.\nThe following averages are for the 20 first-class matches only.\nBatting.\nIn all 28 matches G Challenor was leading run scorer with 1967.

In 1908–09, he also served as their head coach. He sold the club to P. J. Doran in 1909. The sale eventually triggered the formation of the National Hockey Association (NHA) when Doran moved the Wanderers to the Jubilee Rink. The Rink was smaller than the Wanderers' previous rink, the Montreal Arena, and the other Eastern Canada Hockey League members formed a new ice hockey league to remove the Wanderers. The Wanderers then formed their own league (the NHA) in partnership with Ambrose O'Brien. The ECHA's new league failed and some of the teams joined the NHA.\nStrachan later served as first president of the Montreal Maroons ice hockey club. Strachan intended for the Maroons to be a revival of the Wanderers but he could not secure clear title to the name. The original Wanderers had folded in 1918 after a fire at the Montreal Arena. Lacking a name, the club was dubbed the 'Maroons' after the colour of their jerseys. In their second season the Maroons won the Stanley Cup championship in 1926. Strachan served as Maroons' president from their founding in 1924 until June 1934, when he resigned to take care of his businesses.\nJames Strachan's younger brothers Billy and Bert Strachan were both ice hockey players with the Montreal Victorias and the Montreal Wanderers.

        "text": "The West Indies cricket team toured England in 1933, playing three Test matches, losing two of them and drawing the other. In all, the side played 30 first-class matches, winning only five and losing nine.\nThe batting was led by George Headley, who scored almost twice as many runs as the next highest aggregate and averaged 66 runs per innings (the next best was 39). The bowling was spearheaded by the pace of Manny Martindale, from Barbados, who took 14 wickets in the Tests and 103 on the tour. He cut Wally Hammond's chin open at Old Trafford and, in partnership with Learie Constantine in this match, used the same bodyline tactics England had used the previous winter against Australia.\nWisden in 1934 had George Headley as its Cricketer of the Year alongside English players Cyril Walters, Fred Bakewell, Les Townsend and Morris Nichols (see Wisden in Cricinfo).\nThe touring team.\nThe team was captained by the former Cambridge University blue Jackie Grant, who had been captain on the tour of Australia in 1930–31.\nThe full team was:\nIn addition to the regular touring party, Learie Constantine, then of T&amp;T but playing Lancashire League cricket in England and not available for the full tour, played in one Test and four other first-class matches, and George Francis of Barbados, also engaged in League cricket, played in the first Test at Lord's, but was not called on for any other first-class matches. Rolph Grant of T&amp;T, brother of the captain and an undergraduate at Cambridge University, played in the match against the university and Clifford Inniss of Barbados, an undergraduate at Oxford, played in the match against Oxford University and in one other first-class match against MCC.\nConstantine, Francis, Griffith, Hoad, Martin and Roach had been members of the 1928 West Indies side which toured England and were the first to play Test cricket. All six of them played in Tests on that tour. Achong, Barrow, Da Costa and Headley had made their Test debuts in the 1929–30 season against the England team. Jackie Grant's first Test appearances were on the 1930-31 tour of Australia. Christiani, Martindale, Merry, Sealey and Wiles had not played Test cricket before this tour and all of them except Christiani played Tests in the 1933 series. Christiani made his Test debut in the 1934-35 series against England, as did Rolph Grant. The other co-opted player on this tour, Clifford Inniss, never played Test cricket.\nThe manager of the team was John Kidney, who played 11 first-class matches for Barbados between 1909 and 1932. He later managed the 1939 touring team in England.\nThe Test matches.\nThree Test matches, each of three days' duration, were played.\nFirst Test, at Lord's, 24, 26, 27 June.\nWest Indies lost six first-innings wickets for 55 before the end of the second day, and the other four in 65 minutes on the final morning. Walter Robins took six wickets for 32 runs. Following on 199 behind, West Indies did better, with Headley making 50 out of 64 and Hoad and Grant adding 52 for the fourth wicket. But George Macaulay and Hedley Verity each took four wickets and the match was won in mid-afternoon.\nSecond Test, at Manchester, 22, 24, 25 July.\nBarrow and Headley made the first centuries for West Indies in Tests in England and put on 200 for the second wicket before Barrow was out for 105. Headley went on to an unbeaten 169 but of the other batsmen only Constantine, released from his club contract for this match, made much impact, his 31 coming out of 36. Martindale and Constantine used the bodyline \"leg-theory\" style of bowling fast and short to a packed leg-side field, and England lost four wickets for 134, including Hammond, who returned to bat after having his chin split open by a short-pitched ball. Douglas Jardine led the resistance, putting on 83 with Ames and 140 with Robins. Jardine's 127 was his first Test match century. Martindale took five wickets for 73 runs. When West Indies batted a second time, England fast bowler Edward Clark also bowled leg-theory, but with little success. James Langridge, in his first Test, took seven wickets for 56, but Roach made 64 and Constantine the same number, and the match was left drawn when the West Indies second innings ended.\nThird Test, at The Oval, 12, 14, 15 August.\nAn experimental England side under the captaincy of Bob Wyatt was reliant on 107 from Fred Bakewell, made out of 194. Charlie Barnett, with 52 in his first Test, then put on 95 in 85 minutes for the eighth wicket with Stan Nichols, who made 49. When West Indies batted, only debutant Sealey, with 29, made much of the bowling of Clark, Nichols and another player new to Test cricket, Charles Marriott. Marriott followed his five for 37 with six for 59 in the second innings, giving match figures of 11 for 96. Roach made 56 and Da Costa 35, but the match was over early on the third day.\nOther first-class matches.\nWisden in 1934 says the team played in 30 first-class matches, including the three test matches against England, and of these they won five, drew 16 and lost nine. Outside the first-class fixtures they engaged in eight of lesser importance, being successful in three of these and drawing the other five.\nFor source, see Wisden 1934 in Cricinfo."

The moment was captured and a large copy of the photo is on display outside the coach's office at Belle Vue.\nIn 2007, he was named as Wakefield Trinity Wildcats's Player of the Year again. He was also named at centre in the Super League Dream Team, and was short-listed for the Man of Steel award along with Trent Barrett and James Roby.\nIn 2009, he wore the number 8 jersey for Wakefield Trinity Wildcats, in memory of his close friend Adam Watene. Demetriou is associated with the Adam Watene Fund, helping raise funds for his family in New Zealand. In 2010, he was awarded a 3-month testimonial at the Wakefield Trinity Wildcats as a reward for his hard work and dedication to English rugby league.\nInternational career.\nDemetriou played two games for at the 2000 Rugby League Emerging Nations Tournament.\nDemetriou said in 2022, \"I should have played twice for before I retired but off-season surgery stopped me. Probably the one regret I had during my career was not being able to represent Greece.\"\nCoaching career.\nDemetriou's contract with Wakefield Trinity Wildcats expired at the end of 2010, and he was told that it would not be renewed. He initially joined the York City Knights for 2011, but a subsequent offer as player-coach for Keighley Cougars arose, and was accepted. In his first season in charge, Keighley gained promotion to the Kingstone Press Championship.\nDemetriou returned to Australia in 2013, becoming the head coach for the Northern Pride in the Queensland Cup. During his two seasons at the Pride, the club won back-to-back minor premierships, the 2014 Queensland Cup Grand Final and the inaugural NRL State Championship game. In 2014, he coached the Queensland Residents side, who defeated the NSW Cup rep side 24–16.\nIn October 2014, Demetriou joined the North Queensland Cowboys as an assistant coach. On 4 October 2015, Demetriou was a member of the North Queensland coaching staff in the side's 17–16 Grand Final victory over Brisbane.\nIn January 2016, Demetriou joined the St. George Illawarra Dragons as an assistant coach and as head coach to their NSW Cup feeder team, the Illawarra Cutters. In September 2016, he was named coach of the 2016 Intrust Super Premiership NSW Team of the Year. He went on to win the grand final with the Cutters that year. \nIn 2017, Demetriou joined Brisbane under head coach Wayne Bennett. He took over as the side's attacking coach in Round 6 of the 2018 NRL season, with the side scoring the second most tries in the competition from that point forward.\nIn December 2018, he joined South Sydney as an assistant coach, following Bennett to the club. In February 2020, it was announced that Demetriou would succeed Bennett as head coach at the end of the 2021 NRL season. On 6 August 2020, it was announced Demetriou would make his coaching debut for the South Sydney Rabbitohs after head coach Wayne Bennett breached the NRL's COVID-19 protocols. His first match as coach saw the South Sydney club defeat Brisbane by 28–10 at ANZ Stadium in Sydney.\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2021 NRL season, he replaced the outgoing Bennett as the new head coach of South Sydney. In his first official game in charge, South Sydney were defeated 11-4 by Brisbane at Suncorp Stadium. In round 3 of the 2022 NRL season, he earned his first win in charge of South Sydney against arch rivals the Sydney Roosters.\nIn his first full season at South Sydney, he guided the club to their fifth straight preliminary final. Souths took an early 12-0 lead over Penrith but were eventually defeated 32-12.\nIn his second season at the club, Demetriou guided Souths to second place on the table during the midway point of the 2023 NRL season. However, the club would suffer a form slump in the second half of the year only winning four matches. South Sydney would finish 9th on the table missing the finals for the first time since 2017.\nAt the start of the 2024 NRL season under Demetriou, South Sydney lost their opening three matches of the season including a humiliating 48-6 loss against arch-rivals the Sydney Roosters. It was South Sydney's worst start to a season since 2008.\nAhead of the clubs round 6 game against Cronulla, it was reported that Demetriou would be sacked as South Sydney head coach if they failed to win the match. Despite the team losing the match 34-22, Demetriou was not terminated due to an observable improvement in the team's effort for the game. The team would ultimately suffer yet another defeat after their subsequent bye, losing to Melbourne 54-20. Although no formal announcement was made by the club about Demetriou's status immediately following the loss, it was reported that club officials would be holding an official meeting regarding his future. On 30 April 2024, the club formally terminated Demetriou as coach, appointing Ben Hornby as an interim for the remainder of the season. "

The club remained competitive for the next decade, and played a remarkable grand final tie led by captain John Coughlan against Burnie/Yeoman Cricket Club in the 1965/66 season, both sides being all out for 122. However Wynyard were awarded the title on the basis of having finished higher in the league, and so won their first NWTCA premiership.\nIn the 1974/75 season new clubrooms were constructed at the Showground with an incredible amount of voluntary work contributed, and it proved the start of another successful season, with the club wrapping up their second premiership that season under the captaincy of Maurice Hodgetts.\nThe club struggled for success in the 1980s, but managed to finally win a third title in the 1990/91 season under the guidance of Shane Walker.

        "text": "Peter Hynes (born 18 July 1982) is a retired Australian professional rugby union footballer. He played on the wing or at fullback for the Queensland Reds and Australia.\nEarly life.\nBorn and raised in Brisbane, Hynes attended Brisbane State High School, and formally St Laurence's college where he was a schoolboy 400m sprint champion and was selected to play for the Australian Schoolboys rugby team in 2000.\nHynes played for the University of Queensland Rugby Club, and was invited to join the Queensland Reds Rugby College in 2001.\nRugby career.\nHynes was chosen for the Queensland Under 19s and went on to play for Australia at the Under 19 World Cup in Chile in 2001. He was selected for the Australian Sevens team in 2002, and he played for Australia Under 21s two years in a row at the Under 21 Rugby World Championships in 2002 and 2003.\n2003–2007.\nHynes signed a contract with the Queensland Reds for the 2003 season, and made his Super 12 debut for the Reds against the Hurricanes on 4 April 2003. He was selected to tour with Australia A and played in the two matches against Japan at Osaka and Tokyo in June 2003.\nOn 8 May 2004, in a match against the Waratahs, Hynes scored the first ever Reds try at Suncorp Stadium in front of a record Australian Super 12 crowd.\nHynes earned his 20th Super Rugby cap in 2005, the last season of the Super 12 before the competition expanded to 14 teams. It was the middle of several lean years for the Queensland team and the backline players being starved of possession under a 10-man rugby gameplan was frustrating for Hynes.\nIn November 2006, Hynes played for the Australian Prime Minister's XV against Japan in Tokyo, scoring the opening try in a 61-19 thrashing of the home side.\nHynes notched up his 50th game for the Reds in 2007, a year where his versatility was put to the test, playing at wing and inside centre after some trial games at flyhalf. Later in 2007, he played six matches for the Ballymore Tornadoes in the Australian Rugby Championship.\n2008–2011.\nPhil Mooney was installed as the Reds' coach in 2008, and brought in a new gameplan that encouraged instinct and flair. Hynes had his best year for the Reds, scoring several spectacular tries in 2008, including an 80-metre solo effort against the Lions in Johannesburg. His punishing defence was also outstanding.\nHynes made his Test debut for the Wallabies as one of the two run-on wingers against Ireland in Melbourne on 14 June 2008. He had a very strong game and won the Player's Player award for the match against Ireland. Two weeks later, he went on to win the Man of the Match award in the first Test against France on 28 June 2008. In the second Test against France on 5 July 2008, Hynes scored his first try for the Wallabies in front of his home crowd at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane. After playing in all six Test matches in the 2008 Tri Nations Series, Hynes received the Wallabies Rookie of the Year award, and toured with the Wallabies on the 2008 Spring tour.\nHynes had an injury-affected campaign in 2009 and played 8 matches in the Super 14 season for the Reds. He never shook off lingering knee problems, even after a mid-season arthroscopic operation, He nevertheless returned to play for the Wallabies with a win against Italy in Melbourne on 20 July 2009. He played in the 2009 Tri Nations Series and on the 2009 Spring tour, and extended his number of Test caps to 22.\nThroughout 2010, Hynes battled a degenerative condition in his left knee, in which the cartilage was gradually being worn away. He played 12 matches in the Super 14 season for the Reds, and had another arthroscopic operation at the end of the season to clear out the debris. He played two matches for the Australian Barbarians against England in June 2010, but had lost top-end speed and did not make much impact. He did not gain reselection for the Wallabies.\nHynes entered the 2011 season with severe bone bruising in his left knee resulting from the cartilage degeneration and was forced to miss all but the opening two matches of the Reds 2011 Super Rugby title-winning season.\nRetirement and post-rugby career.\nAfter many months of treatment in 2011, Hynes decided to undergo a radical surgery to guarantee he wouldn't experience severe pain or have any limitations in his knee later in life. The innovative surgery involved a posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; a high tibia Osteotomy, whereby his leg was broken and re-aligned; and a donor meniscus transfer.\nDuring his rehabilitation, Hynes worked for the Queensland Rugby Commercial Team as a Business Development Executive. Hynes retired from rugby in 2012, and took up a business development career with Technology One, an international corporation based in Brisbane."

Ross was educated at Swansea High School, where he represented 1992 Australian Schoolboys.\nRobbie is a local Newcastle Knights junior.\nPlaying career.\nRoss forced clubmate Robbie O'Davis onto the wing during the 1995 season. Ross, who signed a Super League contract that year, joined Brisbane while News Ltd fought a battle through the courts to stage its rebel competition.\nThe potent attacking later honoured his contract with the newly formed Hunter Mariners in 1997. Ross represented New South Wales in the Super League Tri-series competition, but following the demise of the Mariners and the re-unification of the game, quickly secured a contract with the Melbourne Storm as the first player signed by the club.\nA great start to the 1999 season saw Ross chosen for the New South Wales rugby league team. In the second match of 1999 State of Origin series, Ross scored the fastest try in Origin history when Ryan Girdler sent him over in the corner from the second tackle of the match. Later that year, Ross played at fullback for Melbourne in their historic 1999 NRL Grand Final victory and was catapulted into the Australian Test team. After making his debut in the first match of the 1999 Tri-nations series, a 24–22 loss to New Zealand, he was replaced by Darren Lockyer for the remainder of the tournament.\nHaving won the 1999 Premiership, Melbourne Storm contested in the 2000 World Club Challenge against Super League Champions St Helens R.F.C., with Ross playing at and scoring two tries in the victory.

The gloves are designed to protect players' hands, wrists, and forearms from checks, or legal defensive hitting common in the sport. Gloves consist of thick padding on the back of the hand and forearm covered in leather or canvas material, and a palm area made of synthetic and mesh material. A goaltender's gloves may have extra padding for the thumb to protect against injury from shots. While NCAA collegiate rules require that men's gloves have palms covered, other leagues, including post-collegiate club lacrosse, the National Lacrosse League, Major League Lacrosse, and international play, permit players to cut out the palm area for greater grip and control of the lacrosse stick.\nWomen's lacrosse rules do not require glove use, except for goalies since hitting is not permitted, but some players use smaller gloves for increased grip and minor protection from incidental contact.\nThe size of the glove is an important factor for players to consider, also including protective functionality, and what material the gloves are made out of. Ventilation, and dexterity can also be important factors. Many modern gloves offer a wrist cuff which can be adjusted by various means to fit securely to the player's wrist and provide the player with greater control of comfort and protection."

        "text": "The 1992 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament began on March 18 and ended on April 5. The tournament featured 48 teams. The Final Four consisted of Virginia Cavaliers, Stanford Cardinal, Southwest Missouri State Lady Bears (now known as Missouri State), and Western Kentucky Lady Toppers, with Stanford defeating Western Kentucky 78–62 to win its second NCAA title. Stanford's Molly Goodenbour was named the Most Outstanding Player of the tournament.\nNotable events.\nMissouri State (then Southwest Missouri State), was not a regular participant in the Tournament. They had not earned a bid until 1991, when they won their first game and lost their second game. In 1992, they were assigned an eight seed. Their first game was against Kansas, which they won 75–59. That win matched them up against the number one seed in the Midwest region, Iowa. The Hawkeyes were 25–3, winner of the Big Ten conference in their ninth year under Hall of Fame coach C. Vivian Stringer. Despite the odds, the Southwest Missouri State team took Iowa to overtime, and won 61–60 in the overtime period. That matched up the Lady Bears against fifth-seeded UCLA, but Southwest Missouri State won easily, 83–57. Their next game was against SEC regular season champion Ole Miss, one of a small number of teams who had played in every NCAA tournament since the first one in 1982. Ole Miss was the number two seed in the region, but Southwest Missouri State again achieved an upset, winning the game 94–71. That win placed the Lady Bears in the Final Four. Prior to this win, the lowest seed to make it to the Final Four was a four seed. Only one team, Arkansas in 1998, with a nine seed, has made it to the Final four with a weaker seed.\nSouthwest Missouri State's opponent in the semi-final game was Western Kentucky, who has also achieved some upsets. After beating Alabama, the Lady Toppers faced Tennessee, the number one seed in the Mideast region, and the defending national champions. Western Kentucky won the game 75–70, and went on to beat the number 2 seed in the region, Maryland, by the identical score.\nThe other semi-final included two of the powerhouses of the sport at the time. Both Virginia and Stanford were number one seeds. Stanford had won the National championship two years before, while Virginia was competing in their third consecutive final four, and were the runner-up in the prior year's tournament.\nIn the game between Western Kentucky and Southwest Missouri State, the Lady Toppers dashed the upset hopes of the Lady Bears, and won the game 84–72. The game between Stanford and Virginia was much closer, with Virginia leading late but Stanford pulled to a small lead. Virginia's Dawn Staley scored to cut the lead to one with eleven seconds left. Stanford now controlled the ball, and in bounded it, but with time running out, the ball was loose on the floor. Staley dived after the loose ball, recovered it and flung it to teammate Melanee Wagener while Staley called for a timeout. The referee did not hear her call for the timeout, then heard the horn announcing the end of the game, so the refs and the teams headed off the court. Staley chased after Doug Cloud, the referee, insisting she had called a time out. A different referee, Bob Trammell, had heard her call for the timeout, so the teams were called back, and a fraction of a second were placed back on the clock. Virginia in bounded the ball and got it to Staley, but she was unable to get a final shot off. Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer would call it, \"the longest seven-tenths of a second in my life\". The Cardinal won a one-point game 66–65. Van Derveer would later recount the story when preparing to train the USA National team, including Staley, for the 1996 Olympics.\nAfter losing three starters from the prior year's team, including All-American Sonia Henning, some observers, including assistant coach Amy Tucker, were not expecting a stellar season. Their point guard, Molly Goodenbour, had not seen a lot of playing time in prior years playing behind Henning and Jennifer Azzi, but she would go on to hit 18 three-pointers in the tournament, at the time an NCAA record, and win the MVP award for the tournament. Teammates Rachel Hemmer and Val Whiting also earned spots on the All-Tournament team as the team won a 78–62 victory over Western Kentucky to claim their second national championship in three years.\nQualifying teams – automatic.\nForty-eight teams were selected to participate in the 1992 NCAA Tournament. Twenty-two conferences were eligible for an automatic bid to the 1992 NCAA tournament.\nQualifying teams – at-large.\nTwenty-six additional teams were selected to complete the forty-eight invitations.\nBids by conference.\nTwenty-two conferences earned an automatic bid. In eleven cases, the automatic bid was the only representative from the conference. Three conferences, the Great Midwest, the Midwestern Collegiate, and the North Atlantic conferences sent a single representative as an at-large team. One independent school was selected. Twenty-five additional at-large teams were selected from ten of the conferences.\nFirst and second rounds.\nIn 1992, the field remained at 48 teams. The teams were seeded, and assigned to four geographic regions, with seeds 1–12 in each region. In Round 1, seeds 8 and 9 faced each other for the opportunity to face the 1 seed in the second round, seeds 7 and 10 played for the opportunity to face the 2 seed, seeds 5 and 12 played for the opportunity to face the 4 seed, and seeds 6 and 11 played for the opportunity to face the 3 seed. In the first two rounds, the higher seed was given the opportunity to host the first-round game. In most cases, the higher seed accepted the opportunity. The exceptions:\nThe following table lists the region, host school, venue and the thirty-two first and second round locations:\nRegionals and Final Four.\nThe regionals, named for the general location, were held from March 26 to March 28 at these sites:\nEach regional winner advanced to the Final Four, held April 4 and April 5 in Los Angeles at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena (co-hosts: University of Southern California, University of California, Los Angeles)\nBids by state.\nThe forty-eight teams came from twenty-nine states, plus Washington, D.C. California had the most teams with seven bids, the first time in tournament history a state had more than four bids. Twenty-one states did not have any teams receiving bids.\nBrackets.\nFirst and second-round games played at higher seed except where noted.\nRecord by conference.\nFifteen conferences had more than one bid, or at least one win in NCAA Tournament play:\nSeven conferences went 0-1: Colonial, Metro, MAAC, Midwestern Collegiate, North Atlantic Conference, Ohio Valley Conference, and Southern Conference."

        "text": "The Puerto Rico Baseball Academy &amp; High School (PRBAHS) is a non-profit organization combining academics and sports programs into one curriculum. Its goal is to prepare its students for higher education, competitive college scholarship opportunities, and the Major League Baseball Draft. The PRBAHS is one of the baseball high schools in Puerto Rico or the United States with this type of learning environment.\nThe school is located 30 minutes outside of San Juan near the University of Turabo in Gurabo, Puerto Rico. It admits students ages 14–18 into 10th through 12th grade.\nHistory.\nThe school was first envisioned by former Texas Rangers pitcher Edwin Correa, who was motivated by the decline of Puerto Rican players in the major leagues. The Dominican Republic has recently had many more players signed than Puerto Rico has, in part because of differing rules. United States standards, upheld by the PRBAHS, require players to complete a high school diploma or to be at least 18 years of age, while Dominican players are able to sign with major league organizations as early as 16 years of age. For the 2003 season, there were 38 versus 79 on the Major League rosters that came from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, respectively.\nAlthough the school was founded in 2002, its inception began 1999, when founder Ed Correa coached at Las Palmas, the Los Angeles Dodgers’ complex located in the Dominican Republic. It was at Las Palmas where his vision began and he decided to use the complex as a model to draft his own prototype.\nProgram curriculum.\nThe core academic curriculum includes courses in Spanish, English, United States History, Puerto Rican History, Latin American History, Biology, Work Management, Chemistry, Physics, Geometry, Algebra, Trigonometry, and Pre-calculus. The available electives are Health, Photography, Psychology, Sports Psychology, Music, Journalism, Ethics, History of Baseball, and the Critical Analysis of Chess.\nThe baseball program emphasizes the mental, physical, and technical aspects of each position to create a complete understanding of the game. Topics covered include throwing mechanics, weight training, fielding mechanics, communication, running the bases, the mental aspect of the game, run downs, the art of pitching, the art of catching, and bunt plays.\nCommunity involvement.\nIn addition to academics and sport, the school also encourages community outreach and involvement in local activities. Students visit hospitals during the holidays, participate in interactive sporting days with disadvantaged children, and visit centers for children."

        "text": "Indios de Mayagüez is a Puerto Rico professional basketball team. The team plays in the Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN). The Indios play their home games in the Palacio de Recreación y Deportes since 1981. The franchise first entered the league in 1956, and Mayagüez has been its home city for all but five of the team's active seasons given that the franchise has gone through several hiatuses in its history. Along with the Atléticos de San Germán, the Indians have been the only BSN team permanently based in the western part of Puerto Rico, after the Tiburones de Aguadilla relocated to Santurce and became the Cangrejeros de Santurce in 1998.\nThe team has advanced to the BSN Finals only once, winning the 2012 season championship over the Capitanes de Arecibo with a record of 22–8 after having just made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history in 2009. The team has qualified for the playoffs in 3 seasons of their 59-year existence.\nHistory.\nAfter a failed first attempt during the 1956 and 1957 seasons, Mayagüez has had a BSN franchise since 1972. With hiatuses between 1958 and 1971, 1997 and finally during the 2005 and 2006 seasons.\nFirst attempt.\nThe City of Mayagüez had its first BSN franchise 1956 where José E. Arraras (who in 2000, would end up owning the team) was a player. In 1957 Eddie Lojo joined a team that also had the \"Marvelous Blondie\" (rubio maravilloso) Jaime Frontera and Pedro ‘Golo’ Laracuente, his first season in the league and the only one with Mayagüez. Rafael ‘Bolote’ Selosse was the head coach. Gabriel Castro Rivera, known for the ‘Los Indios de mi Pueblo’ program, was a co-owner along with William Navas and Mario Quintero. Between 1958 and 1971 Mayagüez entered its first hiatus as a franchise, returning to the league in 1972.\nA solid team 1972–1982.\nBy that year, the team owners were, Segismundo López and Enrique ‘Chino’ Vázquez Báez, the team played in the gymnasium/coliseum of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez (RUM) until 1980. The 1972 roster included such legendary figures as Eugenio ‘Geño’ Borrero (72-79), John Burgos, José ‘Cheo’ Mangual (72–77 and 79–83) and ponceño Tomas ‘Guabina’ Gutiérrez. In 1973 Andrés ‘Conga’ Cepeda (73–80), ‘Piro’ Cabrera and Jack Allison arrived. The 1974 roster included Víctor Secuola and Ralph Menar and in 1975 José (Joe) Pacheco, was the best scorer of the team equipo with 18PPG. Pacheco only played for Mayagüez that year (beforehand he had played for the Ponce Lions, Caguas and the Bayamón Cowboys). In 1976, Alex Vega, Cesar Fantauzzi (76–77), Elket Forbes (76,77,81) and Diego Meléndez (76, 81 y 82 with Mayagüez) arrived and took the quintet's offense along with Menar. Yamil Brunet (76–77) was there for two seasons and Alex Vega (76–82) played with Mayagüez for seven seasons.\nIn 1977, the new team stars were Nelson Richardson and Dino Robertson. Robertson (77-78) only played two seasons in the league, both for Mayagüez, and averaged 24 PPG. Richardson played in Mayagüez for 5 seasons (77-81). During the 1978 season, the roster was intact, only with Secuola's return who was with Mayagüez on three occasions (74, 78, 80). The 1979 season saw the team adding locals, José ‘Gorilon’ Alicea (79–83) and Rubén Bayron (79–81). In 1980 the approval of the entrance of players from other Latin American countries into the BSN made possible the hiring of Dominican Frank Prats, who only played for two seasons (80 and 82). The 1980s brought many legendary figures near the end of their careers to Mayagüez. Among them were the great Teófilo ‘Teo’ Cruz, who played for \"the tribe\" between 1981 and 1982, when he retired from basketball and Héctor ‘El Mago’ Blondet who wore the \"taíno\" uniform during the 1981 season. The 1981 season also had Jaime Rivera, Rolando Alvarez, Noel Martin and Pete Aguilar (81–83). This season was filled with many high expectations from the fans as the team signed various veteran starting players and moved into the Sports and Recreation Palace. After losing their first three games, the team fired their American coach and Radio reporter Johnny Flores, who worked as assistant coach took the job, achieving 6 consecutive victories and becoming a sensation, until Mayaguez confronted the league-leading Ponce Lions when a fight broke out between the teams and the referees had to suspend play and five players from \"the tribe\", ending the team's hopes for the rest of the season. In 1982 Juan ‘Conejo’ Rosas and Juan Alverio (82–86 and 90) arrived in what was Mario Henry Rodriguez's last year with the team. Rodríguez had been playing with the team for eight seasons (75–82).\nGlory Days 1983–1988.\nWith Dr. Ariel Rojas Davis, Eudaldo Báez Cruz and Dr. Iván Martínez Deliz as club owners, 1983 saw the arrival of Vicente Ithier (83-88 and 90 in Cabo Rojo), Gerry Ocasio (83–87), Bradley Pacheco (83 y 84) and Eddie Torres (1983). A year later (1984) Mexican-American Julio Gallardo (84–87 and 89 in Cabo Rojo) arrived, Germán Hernández (85 y 86) and Manny Figueroa (one season) would arrive in 1985. In 1986 Richard Soto (86–93) a humble but always effective center arrived. Mike Santos wore Mayaguez's uniform in 1986 and 87. In 1987 four new players entered the club (Pedro Albizu, Raymond de Jesús, Mitchell and Gerald Lebrón). De Jesús would stay the longest with the team, playing for six seasons (87–92). In ‘88’ Gustavo Santos and Frank Memoli (88–89) arrived.\nRelocation to Cabo Rojo.\nDisagreements in the rental fee of the Recreation Palace with the Municipal Administration of Mayaguez forced club directors to relocate the team south to the neighboring town of Cabo Rojo and the team became the Taínos de Cabo Rojo. The 1989 season starred played as Raymond De Jesús, Richard Soto, Memoli and ‘Gus’ Santos. In 1990, Ian Lockhart (90–92 and 2007) and Ramón ‘Rayo’ Rivera (90–93) arrived. In 1991 Tony Echevarría (89–93) became a stellar player as he was tall, good but undisciplined. Only for the 1992 season Reyes Ortiz joined the team. In 1993 the Bocachica brothers, Johnny ‘El Diablo’ Caraballo and Marcus Webb arrived. These coaches while the club was in Cabo Rojo were Johnny Flores, ‘Paquin’ Abreu, Rick Shore and Don Silveri.\nReturn to Mayagüez 1994–1999.\nIn the year 1994, the team moved back to Mayagüez and became the Taínos de Mayagüez. They presented a club led by Aguadillan Jorge Medrano, former Cowboy Alberto Montañéz (94 y 95), Jorge Rivera, ‘Mandy’, Cesar Bocachica and Franklin Román (94 and 98), among others. In 1995 Edwin Pellot wore the uniform of Mayagüez as also did Joel Quiñones (95, 96, 2009 and 2010). In '96' came Geno Soto (96, 2000, 01). That year the Tainos had a great reinforcement in Anthony Douglas. In 1997 the franchise took a season hiatus and returned for the 1998 season, which starred Carlos Escaleea, John Cotte and in which Matt Nover was also a productive player.\nIn 1999, with Jose E. Arraras as club owner, Fernando Ortiz and Christian Dalmau arrived (later Damon Santiago and Gerardo Zayas would arrive in a controversial trade with San Germán for Dalmau). T.L. Latson (99–2004) and Guillermo ‘Panamá’ Meyer helped the cause for many years. During that time, Alfred \"Butch\" Lee Edgardo Vechio and ‘Pito’ Vargas coached the team\n2000s.\nBy 2001, team owner Don Luis Falto began to invest large amounts of money without skimping on expenses and brought to Mayagüez the best players and leaders available (Edgardo Vechio, ‘Butch’ Lee, Flor Meléndez). This good-willed experiment didn't work as it was a very talented team but lacked discipline (Andrés Guibert, Lázaro Borrel, Orlando Vega, Tyler Brown, James Carter, Elmyr García, Freddie Martínez, Ferdinand Morales, Michelo Dávila, Josué Nieves, Leroy Jackson, Joe Murray, Gary Joe Burgos, Puruco Latimer, Lee Benson, Bimbo Carmona and Ricardo Dalmau. Most of them were veterans who had already seen the best of their careers. It's worth noting that during this time Mayagüez also signed the best prospects of the decade: José Juan Barea, Alexander Galindo, Jesus Verdejo, Felix Davila y Samuel Hernandez, who became reserve players for the team because the NCAA changed its eligibility rules with respect to Puerto Rican players who formed part of the BSN as well as the NCAA. This experiment lasted until yet another hiatus in 2005 and 2006. During the hiatus, the franchise forgot to send his roster of players to the league, losing the booking fees on all players, including the college reserves. The franchise returned to the league in 2007, near the point of dissolving. It had several problems with coaches Wigberto Quintana, Gabi Miranda, Manolo Cintron and Omar González. Keenan Jourdon (2007–10) became the team leader. That year Giovanni Jiménez (2007–present) as well as cubans Ángel Caballero y Roberto Herrera arrived and performed well. In 2008 Eddie Casiano, former Puerto Rico national team member, retires as player, succumbing to the many lesions. In 2009, their first season under owner Luis Vargas and Eddie Casiano as head coach, they reached their first semi finals in franchise history. They lost to eventual the eventual BSN champions, the Bayamón Cowboys in the semi-final series 4–2. That year, Luis Vargas won the Owner of the Year Award and Eddie Casiano won the Coach of the Year Award.\nThe road to the championship 2010–2011.\nIn 2010, Mayagüez started the season 0–10 due in part to injuries to key players, including a season-ending injury to their captain, Giovanni Jimenez. Their first win of the season came April, 3rd 2010 against fellow rivals, the San Germán Athletics in a game played at the Rebekah Colberg Coliseum in Cabo Rojo. The game ended 87–83 in a win for Mayagüez. The Indios finished the season with a 7–22 mark, one of their worst in franchise history.\nDuring the 2011 season, Mayagüez were determined to turn things around and forget their horrendous 2010 season. They signed Venezuela's national team player, Héctor \"Pepito\" Romero as their key addition. Also added were some role players such as Eric Rodríguez and Héctor Valenzuela during the off season. They selected Carlos Rivera from a special draft from Leones de Ponce and former Siena player Edwin Ubiles in the BSN's new players Draft. Their key loss was townsman Alex Galindo, to the Gallitos de Isabela.\nMayagüez started the 2011 season with two losses to the Piratas de Quebradillas and the Gallitos de Isabela. Their struggles continued, but in their third game of the season, played at the Palacio de Recreación y Deportes, they finally got their first win of the season, against power house Santurce Crabbers by a final score of 80–68 to the delight of fans in attendance. By mid season, Mayagüez would again confront problems with Héctor Romero (knee injury) and Herve Laminaza (family problems). The team then signed Dwayne Jones, Sean Williams, Lee Nailon and Brandon Robinson to substitute these players. Mayagüez would be in race for the eighth and final spot of the playoffs but the team had two games confiscated and reschedule to be replayed because of an ineligible player change for Herve Laminaza. The league ruled that the substitution of Lee Nailon for Herve Laminaza surpassed the team's maximum player change and ruled that the games played by Nailon had to be played again. This determination was devastating for the team's aspirations for the playoffs as they lost one of those two games with the Piratas de Quebradillas and the team fell short by two games to make it to the playoffs for the second time in three seasons. Mayagüez finished with a 10-20 record in 2011.\nChampions.\nDuring the 2012 season, Mayagüez would begin the season with only 9 players signed. The Puerto Rican press had put them as the worst team in the BSN League. With no major stars in the team, Eddie Casiano, who won the Mexican League Championship earlier in the year with Halcones Rojos Veracruz, would be optimistic about these team's players. Their first meeting of the season was against the defending back-to-back BSN champions, the Arecibo Captains. Everyone predicted a blowout win for Arecibo, but Mayagüez shocked the champions and ruined their opening game celebrations with an 80-70 win.\nThe Indios started the season 2-0, before falling to the Bayamón Cowboys on March, 6 (90-83). After blowing an 11-point lead going into the fourth quarter with Guaynabo on March 9, 2012 for a 95–94 loss, Mayagüez won three straight to put their record at 5–2. Another loss to Bayamón on March 17, 2012 dropped them to 5–3. The Indios then went on an 8-game winning streak, the longest for any team that season to obtained the first position on the standing with a 13–3 mark. Their rivals and fellow neighbors the San Germán Athletics beat Mayagüez on April 7, 2012 87–79 stopping the Indios' 8-game winning streak.\nAnother three-game winning streak put the Indios' record at 16-4. Another showdown against San Germán on April 16, 2012 marked the worst loss of the season for the Indios de Mayagüez, a 107-75 loss at the Palacio de Recreación y Deportes Coliseum of Mayagüez, dropping their record to 16-5. After a loss to Guayama on April 19, 2012, Mayagüez won three straight games.\nOn June 8, 2012, they defeated Arecibo 72–61 in Game 5 of the Finals to win their first BSN Championship in team history."

        "title": "We Are Climbing Jacob's Ladder",
        "text": "We Are Climbing Jacob's Ladder (also known as Jacob's Ladder) is an African American slave spiritual based in part on the Biblical story of Jacob's Ladder. It was developed some time before 1825, and became one of the first slave spirituals to be widely sung by white Christians. A number of artists have recorded notable versions of it, and it was used as one of the main themes in the critically praised documentary \"The Civil War\".\nAbout the song.\nAfrican American slaves in the United States created a vibrant culture of resistance and dissent, despite attempts by white slaveowners to indoctrinate them into passivity using a variant of Christianity. Slaves were not permitted to speak while working in the fields, but were permitted to sing and chant in order to alleviate tedium and to impose a rhythm on repetitive motions. This generated two distinctive African American slave musical forms, the spiritual (sung music usually telling a story) and the field holler (sung or chanted music usually involving repetition of the leader's line).\n\"We Are Climbing Jacob's Ladder\" is a spiritual. As a folk song originating in a repressed culture, the song's origins are lost. Some academics believe it emerged as early as 1750, and definitely no later than 1825, and was composed by American slaves taken from the area now known as Liberia. The spiritual utilizes the image of Jacob's ladder, and equates it with the body of Christ (in ways quite similar to the teachings of Catherine of Siena). The song is in the form of call and response, and although lyrics vary from place to place and over time, they generally emphasize spiritual growth, increasing one's knowledge about God, and a call to discipleship. The striving nature of this \"climb\" toward God is depicted as a series of tests, and draws heavily on the New Testament tradition of the Christian as warrior—in this case, overcoming the slave-owner. The traditional lyrics hold out hope that the slave can rise up and escape slavery, and the nature of the call-and-response asks both the singing respondents and the listener for greater sacrifice to reach the next level. The spiritual implies that God's promise to the Biblical patriarch Jacob will also lead the slave to freedom.\nThe song became one of the first African American spirituals to become popular among white Christians.\nImportant recordings.\nPaul Robeson sang and later recorded an \"a cappella\" version, and the American labor movement used the song in the 1930s (sometimes altering the lyrics to reflect the industry being organized). Noted American folk singer Pete Seeger began singing the song some time in the 1930s or 1940s, and in the mid to late 1960s added a new verse (\"We are dancing Sarah's circle\") to reflect, as he saw it, a more feminist, less hierarchical, less restrictive, and more joyful meaning. These lyrics were publicly sung at least as early as 1969. Completely revised feminist lyrics were copyrighted in 1975 by Carole Etzler. Folk singer Arlo Guthrie recorded Seeger's version in 1996, with Seeger assisting with music and vocals, for Guthrie's two-record set, \"More Together Again\". In 2006, rock musician Bruce Springsteen recorded Seeger's version of \"Jacob's Ladder\" for his album \"\".\nDr. Bernice Johnson Reagon recorded an \"a cappella\" version of the song for her 1987 album \"River of Life: Harmony One\" (Flying Fish Records). It was later included on the soundtrack of the 1990 PBS miniseries \"The Civil War\", which was directed by Ken Burns. Jimmy Wolfe, host on WGTB radio in Washington, D.C., called Reagon's recording \"a gem\".\nLyrics.\n\"We Are Climbing Jacob's Ladder\" is sung as a call-and-response. The first two lines (\"We are / climbing\") are call-and-response, while the third line (\"Jacob's ladder\") is sung together. The first three lines are repeated, followed by a new call-and-response seventh line (\"Soldier\"), and then an eighth line (\"of the cross\") sung together. As a folk song, lyrics to \"We Are Climbing Jacob's Ladder\" varied widely, but one 1907 version listed the lyrics (with response in parentheses) as:"

He played for the Giants through the 2009 season before retiring as a player, returning to the Giants for 2010 in a coaching capacity.\nKimura was born in Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan. He joined the Nippon-Ham Fighters from outside the amateur draft in 1990 after graduating from high school, and went on to become the leading utility player in Japanese baseball. His solid hitting, speed, and strong arm made him a valuable offensive and defensive player. He played games at every single position except pitcher, catching four games in the 1999 season. He played first base for one game in 1998. He was registered as an outfielder, but played more games in the infield in recent years. In 2004, he was recruited for the Athens Olympics for his skills as a utility player.\nHe had the same name as Takuya Kimura of the popular Japanese pop group, SMAP. He once made an appearance on the television show SMAP×SMAP, hosted by his namesake.\nOn April 2, 2010, at Hiroshima's Mazda Stadium preceding a game against the Hiroshima Toyo Carp, Kimura was hitting practice knocks to infielders when he suddenly collapsed and was rushed to hospital in a coma. He was diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage and died in Hiroshima, Japan, on April 7, 2010. He died at age 37."

At 3pm on Saturday 21 April 1928 the club’s patron, John Goodwin, officially opened the club and served the first ball. Initial work was done using picks, shovels, horse and dray. The original clubhouse was built in 1930 on the south side of the courts. The current clubhouse was opened in 1955. The club and facilities are located in Corroboree Park.\nAinslie Tennis Club is an incorporated organisation managed by a Committee. Maintenance of the club and Committee management is carried out by volunteer members. The club is also an affiliate of Tennis ACT, which in term is affiliated with Tennis Australia.\nThe club was awarded ACT ‘Tennis Club of the Year’ in 1996.\nIn 2000, two courts were converted to synthetic grass, and in 2002 the third court was converted to synthetic grass.\nThe club, while proud of its rich tradition, has a modern and competitive outlook.\nOn 22 August 1927 fifteen people met at the Social Services Cottage in Lister Crescent, Ainslie to discuss the formation of a local tennis and social club. The Ainslie district was growing rapidly and there developed a need for a social outlet for new residents.\nA provisional committee was appointed to draft a constitution, consult with the Federal Capital Commission on the selection of a site and organise the voluntary labour to be used in construction. Thomas Boag, the Supervisor for Roads and bridges, was placed in charge of the laying of the courts.\nThe committee agreed to devote seventeen Saturday afternoons to the formation of the club. Initial work was done using picks, shovels, horse and dray. Potential female members supplied billy tea (made in the park) for those men working on construction. Various fundraising events were held including a number of successful euchre parties.\nIn 1955 it was suggested a new clubhouse be built. Construction was performed by the Department of Works and the present clubhouse was completed in 1957."

        "text": "Adam Walsh (December 4, 1901 – January 13, 1985) was an American football player and coach. He played college football as a center at the University of Notre Dame where he was an All-American and captain of the 1924 team under Knute Rockne. Walsh then served as the head football coach at Santa Clara University from 1925 to 1928 and at Bowdoin College from 1935 to 1942 and again from 1947 to 1958, compiling a career college football record of 80–85–11. He also coached the Cleveland / Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League (NFL) in 1945 and 1946, tallying a mark of 15–5–1. Walsh was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1968.\nPlaying career.\nWalsh was an outstanding athlete at Hollywood High School in Los Angeles, and earned varsity letters in basketball, track, and football at the University of Notre Dame. Walsh was an All-American center and captain of the 1924 Notre Dame football team under head coach Knute Rockne. Walsh anchored the team's offensive line, dubbed the \"Seven Mules,\" who blocked for the famed \"Four Horsemen\" backfield. The 1924 team completed an undefeated season with a win over Stanford in the Rose Bowl.\nWalsh played every minute of the game against Army in 1924 with two broken hands, never missed a single snap of the ball, was involved in 75 percent of the tackles on defense, and intercepted a pass in the final minutes of the game to preserve a Notre Dame victory. He remains the offensive center on the All-time Notre Dame Team.\nCoaching career.\nWalsh served as head football coach and athletic director at Santa Clara University from 1925 to 1928. He then spent five seasons as the line coach at Yale University, and one season at Harvard University in the same capacity. In 1935, Walsh accepted the head coaching position at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. Though Bowdoin had been winless the prior year, Walsh began his 20-year coaching career at the college with a state championship. His teams won or tied for the Maine championship in seven of his first eight years at Bowdoin.\nBowdoin suspended their football program in 1943 with the onset of World War II. In 1944, Walsh returned to Notre Dame as a line coach for a season. In 1945, he led the Cleveland Rams to the NFL Championship and coached the team the next season after a move to Los Angeles. He returned to Bowdoin after two years with the Rams and a 15–5–1 coaching record in the NFL. Between 1947 and 1958, Walsh's Bowdoin teams won outright or shared the Maine state championship four more times.\nLater life and honors.\nAfter retiring from coaching, Walsh served two terms in the Maine House of Representatives, representing Brunswick as a Democrat and was appointed the U.S. Marshal for Maine under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson.\nWalsh was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1968, the Helms Hall of Fame, and the Maine Sports Hall of Fame in 1976. He was also named to the All-Time Southern California High School Team, the All-time Notre Dame Team, and the All-time Rose Bowl Team."

        "title": "Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball",
        "text": "The Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball team represents the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee in NCAA women's basketball competition. The team has been a contender for national titles for over forty years, having made every NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship tournament since the NCAA began sanctioning women's sports in the 1981–82 season.\nThe team is frequently referred to as the Lady Vols; the formal \"Volunteers\" nickname is regularly shortened by many fans of both men's and women's teams to \"Vols.\" The university considers either \"Lady Volunteers\" or \"Lady Vols\" acceptable.\nThe Lady Vols have won at least a share of the SEC regular season championship 17 times (with the most recent occurrence being in 2015), won 17 SEC tournament championships (with the most recent occurrence being in 2014), made 18 Final Four appearances (with the most recent occurrence being in 2008), and won 8 national championships (with the most recent being in 2008).\nOverview.\nThe Lady Vols were coached by Pat Summitt for over four decades. Under Summitt, the Lady Vols won numerous SEC titles, appeared in 18 NCAA Final Fours and 4 AIAW Final Fours, and won 8 NCAA titles including an undefeated season. Additionally, Tennessee is the only team to have appeared in all 36 NCAA Tournaments, including 34 Sweet 16s (23 of which were consecutive). Summitt's teams were known for participating in a grueling regular season schedule, often toughest in the nation, in order to prepare the team for the NCAA tournament. This tough schedule has caused Tennessee to build up rivalries with many prominent teams, including Texas, Stanford, Louisiana Tech, Old Dominion, and, most notably, Connecticut. Like other Tennessee teams, the Lady Vols compete in the SEC, which is historically a competitive conference producing several NCAA Championship teams this century.\nWithin the conference, Tennessee's main rivals are LSU, Vanderbilt, Kentucky and Georgia, with the series vs. South Carolina and Mississippi State gaining importance due to the emergence of those schools as national powers. Summitt led Tennessee to 1098 victories, with an 84.2% win rate. The numbers at home are even stronger, as Tennessee has won 91% of home games and 93.1% of in-conference home games.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nLady Vols basketball began at the beginning of the 20th century. However, most \"seasons\" consisted of three or four games. The sport was dropped in 1926 and was not picked up again until 1960. Coach Joan Cronan went 8–10 over two seasons before being replaced by Margaret Hutson, who coached for four years with a 60–18 record.\nIn 1974, Pat Head was named the new coach. Head had previously played women's basketball for the UT-Martin Pacers (now known as the Skyhawks), and had just graduated.\nLate 1970s.\nIn the 1974–1975 season, Pat Head took over a 25–2 Lady Vols team. In her opening season, the Lady Vols won the TCWSF Eastern District Championship for the third straight year. However, the team finished only 4th overall in the TCWSF (they had been 2nd the previous two years), and were not invited to the AIAW women's basketball tournament. After finishing 16–11 her second season, Head directed two 20-win teams, winning back-to-back AIAW Region-II championships. 1978 included the Lady Vols defeating 3-time AIAW champion Delta State by 20, and Tennessee's first number one ranking. 1978 saw the Lady Vols participate in their first AIAW Final Four, where they finished 3rd. Head also recorded her 100th win during this season, a 79–66 victory over NC State. Tennessee finished up the 1970s by winning the first ever SEC tournament, and returning to the Final Four, where they finished runner-up to Old Dominion, 68–53.\n1980s.\nDuring the 1980–1981 season, the Lady Vols went 25–6, and avenged their championship game loss to Old Dominion by defeating them three times. The team made it to the AIAW Final Four for the third straight year, but wound up as runner-up for the second consecutive year, losing to Louisiana Tech, 79–59. The coach was now known as Pat Summitt, having married Ross Barnes Summitt II in 1980.\nThe 1981–1982 season featured the first ever NCAA Women's basketball tournament. The Lady Vols were one of 32 teams invited and named a 2 seed in their region. In the region championship, the Lady Vols upset first seeded USC 91–90 in overtime to advance to the Final Four. They would lose their Final Four match-up with Louisiana Tech who ended up winning the tournament.\nThe next season, the Lady Vols won the regular season SEC title, but fell in the SEC tournament to Georgia. Tennessee was invited to the now-36 team NCAA tournament and was given their first ever 1 seed. Tennessee made it to the regional championship, but fell to Georgia again, 67–63. Summitt won her 200th game on December 3, a 69–56 victory over St. John's during the Coca-Cola Classic in Detroit.\nThe 1983–1984 season saw Tennessee start out poorly, 6–4. However, Summitt got her team together and finished 22–10, for her 8th straight 20-win season, a streak that is still on-going. Tennessee not only made it to the NCAA Final Four for the second time out of the three tournaments, but also made it to the title game. However, Tennessee lost by 11 to USC, who had also won the title the previous year. Pat Summitt earned Coach of the Year honors. This season was followed up by another 20-win year in which Tennessee earned both the regular season SEC title (despite only going 4–4) and the tournament title. However, the Lady Vols fell in the NCAA tournament to Mississippi during the Round of 16. The next season was a similar story—the Lady Vols had a decent regular season, played a great tournament (reaching the Final Four for the second time in three years), but fell before winning the title.\nIn 1986–1987, after years of trying, the Lady Vols finally broke through and defeated perennial power Louisiana Tech for their first title, 67–44. The Lady Techsters had defeated the Lady Vols by 12 earlier in the season. Tennessee's Tonya Edwards earned the honor of Most Outstanding Player in the Final Four. During this season, Summitt also earned her 300th win, an 87–66 victory over North Carolina. The next year, the Lady Vols were poised to repeat, as the third-ranked and top seeded Tennessee made it to the Final Four yet again. However, Louisiana Tech avenged their championship loss with a nine-point win, and went on to win the title.\nIn 1988–1989, the Lady Vols made it to the Final Four for the fourth straight year, and as a one-seed for the second straight year. After dispatching Maryland by 12, Tennessee faced SEC rival Auburn for the title. Auburn had lost by two to Louisiana Tech in the title game the previous year, and had been given its only loss in the SEC Championship. However, that loss was to Tennessee, who managed a 15-point victory over the Tigers. The championship game was similar, and Tennessee took home its second title in three years with a 76–60 victory. Record-wise, this was Tennessee's best season yet, as they won 35 games while dropping only 2, one to Auburn in the regular season and the other a two-point loss to Texas. Additionally, the Lady Vols won every NCAA tournament game by at least twelve points.\nIn the final season of the decade, the Lady Vols started off the season well, winning the SEC title. However, the team fell by one to Auburn in the SEC Championship, and then lost in overtime to Virginia in the regional finals, one game shy of making a trip to the Final Four, which was being held in Knoxville. Summitt did accomplish another milestone during this season, however—her 400th win, a 70–69 victory over South Carolina on January 25.\n1990s.\nDespite winning neither the SEC regular season championship nor the tournament championship, Tennessee was given a 1 seed in the 1991 NCAA tournament. After a close win in the regional semifinals against Western Kentucky, Tennessee dispatched Auburn for the second time in three years. In the national semifinals, the Lady Vols beat Stanford, 68–60, to earn the opportunity to avenge the previous year's tournament loss against Virginia. Just as the prior year's game had gone into overtime, so did this one. Down one at the half, the Lady Vols managed to tie the game at 60 by the end of regulation. Tennessee escaped in overtime with a 70–67 win, and their third national title in five years. However, the next year the Lady Vols did not even make it to the regional championship, falling to the same Western Kentucky team they had beaten in the same round the previous tournament, 75–70. The 1992–93 season was better, as Tennessee defeated the defending champions Stanford twice, and swept the SEC season for the first time ever. However, the Lady Vols were unable to win the tournament title, and also fell in the NCAA tournament to Iowa, a 72–56 loss in the regional finals.\nEarly in the 1993–1994 season, Summitt grabbed her 500th win, an 80–45 beating of Ohio State on November 21. Tennessee also won both the regular season and tournament conference titles. However, the streak of years without a Final Four appearance extended to three with a 71–68 loss in the regional semifinals to Louisiana Tech. The next season would be Tennessee's return to the Final Four. Tennessee ran the table in the SEC regular season for the third straight year, but also failed to win the tournament title for the third straight year. The top-seed Lady Vols breezed their way to their fifth national championship game, with no game being closer than 21. However, in the National Championship, the Lady Vols fell to the undefeated UConn Huskies, 70–64. During the off-season, Pat Summitt signed high school standout Chamique Holdsclaw.\nIn 1995–1996, with freshman Holdsclaw and senior Michelle M. Marciniak, the Lady Vols won the SEC tournament and made a second straight Final Four. The other three teams: UConn, Stanford, and Georgia, had all defeated the Lady Vols in the regular season. In the semi-finals, facing the UConn Huskies who had knocked them off for the title the previous year, the Lady Vols shot out to an 11-point lead. However, UConn cut it to 4 by the half, and tied later on. With 12 seconds to go, Tennessee led by three, but the Huskies hit a three to send the game into overtime. This was not enough though, as UT prevailed by 5 in overtime. The championship game was not that close as Tennessee won their fourth title easily, an 83–65 win over Georgia.\nThe 1996–1997 season was one of Summitt's worst seasons ever. In addition to losses to powerhouses such as Louisiana Tech (twice), Stanford, Old Dominion, and Connecticut, Tennessee also lost to teams such as Florida, against whom they had been previously undefeated. After their tenth loss of the season, in the SEC semi-finals to Auburn, the team pulled together in time for the NCAA tournament. Avenging their loss to undefeated Connecticut, Tennessee continued on their way to the championship game, where they redressed another loss, defeating Old Dominion by 9 for their second straight national title. Summitt also earned her 600th win during the season, a 15-point victory over Marquette on November 23, 1996.\nIn many aspects, the 1997–1998 team was Summitt's best. With the top-ranked recruiting class as well as Holdsclaw, the Lady Vols ran the table to a 39–0 season while playing one of the top-ranked schedules in the country. Only three teams came within 10 points of beating them, and the Lady Vols won a 93–75 victory over Louisiana Tech for their third straight national championship.\nChamique Holdsclaw had declared that the 1998–99 team would be the greatest ever. However, this proved not to be the case. Injuries to several players decimated the team, and the Lady Vols ultimately fell to Duke in the regional finals. With this, the Chamique Holdsclaw era ended. A landmark was set during this season however, as \"The Meeks\"—Holdsclaw, Tamika Catchings, and Semeka Randall—became the first trio from one team to be named Kodak All-Americans.\nThe Lady Vols ended the decade with their third straight 30-win season, third straight SEC title, and third straight SEC Tournament title. Additionally, the Lady Vols defeated UConn in the regular season, 72–71, in what would ultimately be the Huskies' only loss of the year. In the NCAA tournament, Tennessee breezed its way to the title game, winning all 5 games by at least ten points. However, in the championship the Lady Vols fell to the Huskies, by a 71–52 score. During the season, Summitt earned her 700th win, 85–62 at Wisconsin.\nAt the 2000 ESPY Awards, the Lady Vols basketball team was named co-team of the decade, along with the Florida State Seminoles football team. Additionally, Pat Summitt was named the Naismith Coach of the Century, and Chamique Holdsclaw earned recognition as player of the century.\n2000s.\nIn the 2000–2001 season, the Lady Vols claimed another SEC title, winning all 14 SEC games. Additionally, they split the season series with the UConn Huskies and headed into the SEC tournament with a 28–1 record. However, the Lady Vols were upset by Vanderbilt in the semifinals, and then lost in the Sweet Sixteen to Xavier, their worst finish since 1993–1994. Despite this, Pat Summitt earned her 750th win, in the second game against UConn, a 92–88 victory. Additionally, the team finished with their fourth straight 30-win season.\nThe 2001–2002 season marked the first time since the beginning of the rivalry that Tennessee and Connecticut played each other only once in the regular season. UConn won this match-up by 14. However they would see each other later in the tournament. Tennessee suffered other losses during the season, losing to Texas by a point and getting badly beaten by the Duke Blue Devils. Additionally, despite winning their fifth straight SEC championship, the Lady Vols fell once again in the tournament, this time to LSU. In the NCAA tournament, Tennessee was able to reach the Final Four yet again, with a 5-point win over Vanderbilt. This trip to the Final Four marked Summitt's 13th appearance, which broke Coach John Wooden's record of 12, as well as her 788th win, which tied her with Jody Conradt for winningest coach in women's basketball history. However, the Lady Vols fell in the national semifinals to Connecticut. This loss ended the season at 29–5, one win shy of extending Summitt's streak of 30-win seasons. Summitt did achieve more milestones during this season. A 106–66 win over USC marked her 200th win at home, a victory against Louisiana Tech was her 300th win against a ranked opponent and her 93–65 win over Arkansas was her 1,000th game as a coach, including international contests.\nDuring the 2002–2003 season, the Lady Vols compiled their 6th perfect SEC season, and additionally beat powerhouses Duke and Louisiana Tech among others. However, the Lady Vols dropped their second straight to Texas and lost yet another game in the series against UConn. This streak would continue as the Lady Vols made it to the title game only to lose to the Huskies again, 73–68. During the season, Summitt earned her 800th win, 76–57 over DePaul, and was the fastest coach to reach this milestone.\nThe 2003–2004 season was quite similar to the previous year. The Lady Vols defeated most of their opponents, including Duke and Louisiana Tech, but dropped games to UConn and Texas. The Lady Vols again went 14–0 in the regular season against SEC competition and again fell in the tournament. And once again, the Lady Vols won five games in the NCAA tournament only to lose in the championship game to Connecticut.\nBy 2004–2005, Connecticut's Diana Taurasi had finally graduated and Tennessee was able to break their losing streak against Connecticut with a 68–67 victory. As Taurasi left, Tennessee received Candace Parker, a highly regarded and nationally known player. However, due to injuries, she was redshirted and did not play that year. Tennessee suffered losses during the season to Duke, Rutgers, and LSU, while beating teams which included Stanford and Louisiana Tech. LSU's win over Tennessee gave the Tigers the SEC title, breaking Tennessee's streak of 7 straight. However Tennessee was able to break their streak of four years without a tournament title, by avenging their loss with a 67–65 victory over LSU in the SEC Championship. In the NCAA tournament, Tennessee defeated the Rutgers team which had beaten them earlier in the year to advance to their fourth Final Four in a row. In the Final Four, the Lady Vols fell to Michigan State by a mark of 68–64. Tennessee had led by 16 at one point, but the Spartans made a record-tying come back to advance to the title game. In the second round of the NCAA tournament, the Lady Vols defeated Purdue. This victory gave Pat Summitt her 880th win, breaking North Carolina coach Dean Smith's record of 879 wins, making her the all-time winningest coach in NCAA history.\n2005–2006 was Candace Parker's first year as a college athlete. After being redshirted the previous year she was recovered from her injuries and became a starter. During the season, the Lady Vols dropped three games to SEC foes LSU, Florida, and Kentucky, their worst SEC season since the 1996–1997 season. The Lady Vols also suffered a bad loss to Duke. However they won their second straight game against Connecticut and rebounded from the poor SEC season to win the tournament for the second year in a row. In the tournament, Tennessee controversially received a two seed instead of the one seed Summitt believed her team deserved, and in the regional finals played North Carolina. Parker tied Ivory Latta for leading scorer with 20 points, but it was not enough. Tennessee trailed from the beginning, falling behind by as many as 16. Late in the second half, the Lady Vols were able to cut the lead down to five, but ultimately fell, 75–63. This loss meant that for the first time in five years Summitt would not be appearing in the Final Four.\nEarly in the 2006–2007 season, Tennessee defeated three ranked teams in a row, Stanford, Arizona State, and Middle Tennessee. After Tennessee lost to the North Carolina Tar Heels again, by 13, the Lady Vols defeated a strong Notre Dame team and defeated UConn for the third time in a row. In Knoxville, Summitt's team fell to top-ranked Duke, 74–70, in a game which Duke scored the first 19 points, with Tennessee not scoring for nearly the first six minutes. Later, in Baton Rouge, the Lady Vols clinched the SEC title against LSU in a game where Candace Parker scored 27. However, in the tournament semifinals, Tennessee fell to the Tigers. In that second game, Parker only scored 4 points. In the NCAA tournament, Summitt's team easily made it to the Final Four, dispatching teams that included SEC foe Mississippi and 13-seeded Cinderella, Marist, winning each game by at least 14. In the Final Four, Tennessee again faced North Carolina. Despite shooting just 27%, the team came back from a 12-point deficit with 8:18 remaining to win, 56–50. In the championship game against Rutgers, Tennessee finally won its seventh title. Down by 11 at the half, Rutgers mounted a small comeback, taking the lead down to 7 with 13:33, only to have Shannon Bobbitt hit three three-pointers. Rutgers responded with a 7–0 run, cutting the lead down to 8, but Parker hit 6 free throws to ice the win for Tennessee.\nThe 2007–08 season started off with the top-ranked Lady Vols going 3–0, including wins over 9th-ranked Oklahoma and 22nd-ranked Texas. The win over Texas was Summitt's 950th. After two more wins, #1 Tennessee knocked off fourth-ranked North Carolina, 83–79, in a rematch of a Final Four match-up last year, to advance to 6–0 on the season.\nTennessee won their next four games, then headed out to California for a match-up with 5th-ranked Stanford. Down 4 with less than 30 seconds remaining, the Lady Vols managed to tie the game up and send it to overtime, but still lost, 73–69.\nThe Lady Vols responded by winning their next seven games, giving them a 17–1 record going into a match-up with Duke. Candace Parker's 17 points and 12 rebounds, including a bucket with 22 seconds remaining, helped the Lady Vols defeat the Blue Devils for the first time in four years, 67–64. After winning their next three games, all against SEC opponents, the Lady Vols met with a top-5 Rutgers squad who had just defeated top-ranked UConn. Down 5 with under 90 seconds remaining, the Lady Vols hit back-to-back threes pointers to regain the lead, but Rutgers' Carson responded with a jumper to give Rutgers a one-point lead. On the other end, Candace Parker missed a shot with time winding down. Tennessee's Nicky Anosike got the rebound and was fouled, sending her to the free throw line where she made both free throws to give Tennessee a one-point victory. However, the finish proved to be controversial, as replays revealed that the game clock had paused with 0.2 seconds remaining, giving Anosike enough time to be fouled. In the following game, against LSU, Tennessee soared out to a 21–2 lead, but led only 33–30 at halftime. In the second half, the Lady Tigers took a quick lead, and never looked back, winning 78–62. Tennessee won the remainder of its regular season games and finished second in the SEC, giving them a first-round bye in the conference tournament. The Lady Vols went on to win the SEC tournament, defeating LSU.(61–55)\nTennessee advanced to their 18th Final Four, defeating LSU by only one point to advance to a second consecutive NCAA tournament championship Game. The Lady Vols defeated the 2-seeded Stanford Cardinal 64–48 to take home their 8th National Championship.\nIn 2009 the team had a rebuilding season, due to the departure of the first pick in the 2008 WNBA Draft Candace Parker. They finished the season at 22–11 and entered the NCAA tournament with the lowest seeding in the program's history at #5. In the opening round of the tournament they played a 26–8 Ball State Cardinals team that was making their NCAA tourney debut. Ball State would go on to win the game 71–55 making history. The Lady Volunteers had never lost in the first two rounds of the tournament, going 42–0 through the years. Tennessee also became the first defending champ to lose its opening game in the women's tourney.\n2010s.\nOn April 18, 2012, Head Coach Pat Summitt (née Head, she had married Ross Barnes Summitt II in 1980) announced that she would be stepping down as coach but remain with the team as a head coach emeritus following her 38 years with the team and recent diagnosis of dementia. Assistant Coach Holly Warlick was announced to be moving up to fill the head coaching position for the Lady Vols Basketball team. The Lady Vols earned their 17th SEC tournament championship as they defeated Kentucky 71–70 on March 9, 2014.\nOn March 27, 2019, Warlick was fired.

Then the two of them played for an age-11 tournament team that went to Tokyo, Japan to play in an international tournament. David was named the outstanding pitcher in that tournament.\nEarly career.\nMarshall was selected by the Chicago White Sox in the 25th round (750th overall) in the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft. However, he did not sign with the White Sox until next year on May 25, 2003. He played for the White Sox Rookie League team for 3 years from 2003 to 2005 before finally playing in Single-A for the Winston-Salem Warthogs in 2006.\nHe went 5–1 with 1.02 ERA in 2006 for the Warthogs.\nProfessional career.\nOakland Athletics.\nOn December 7, 2006, Marshall was selected by the Oakland Athletics in the Rule 5 draft.

        "title": "Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club",
        "text": "Tamil Union Cricket &amp; Athletic Club is a first-class cricket team based in Colombo, Sri Lanka. They play their home games at P. Saravanamuttu Stadium.\nHistory.\nThe club can trace its roots back to the final years of the 19th century in which two pre-existing rival clubs amalgamated to form the Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club. The club's embryonic years benefited from its stewardship by some of the country's most eminent Tamil Lawyers, Politicians and Civil Servants (see below). The first of these clubs was known as the Lanka Sports Club, which was established in 1895 had its base in Price Park. In 1898, the first available mention of office bearers lists D. Muthuswamy (president), G. N. C. Ponnambalam (secretary), future Speaker of the Parliament of Sri Lanka Sir Waithilingam Duraiswamy (club Captain) as the club committee. Duraiswamy would later hold the position of President (1937–48) while G.N.C Ponnambalam that of Captain (1905) in the amalgamated Tamil Union and Athletic Club. A second Tamil sports club was established in March 1899, in a meeting that was called with the objective of organising a second Tamil Sports Club in Colombo. This meeting was duly held at the City College Hall and presided over by the Hon. P. Coomaraswamy, former Member of the Legislative Council of Ceylon (forerunner of the Parliament of Sri Lanka). During the meeting the club elected its governing committee, which included Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam member of the Legislative Council of Ceylon, Mr T Muttu Coomaraswamy, Mr A. E. Strong and Mr E. Sellayah. Sir Ponnambalam's elder brother Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan, former Solicitor General of Sri Lanka later became President of the amalgamated Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club and was followed by Dr. E. V. Ratnam 1931–1937 while Mr E. Sellayah's eldest son (W.M.) Sri Lanka's first full-time Registrar of Companies, later became Honorary General Secretary, while another son (L.W.) went on to captain the Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club and All-Ceylon teams in hockey and later served as a national administrator.\nBy the end of 1899, the two rival Tamil clubs were persuaded to join forces, which resulted in the creation of the Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club, with T. Thirunavakarasu and Dr John Rockwood, the son of the eminent surgeon and member of the Legislative Council of Ceylon, Dr W. G. Rockwood serving as the first President and Honorary General Secretary, respectively. The sports grounds were based at Campbell Park in Borella wherein many sports were played including hockey, cricket, and athletics. In fact, for several decades between the 1930s and 1960s the Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club were one of the premier hockey clubs in the country and won many National tournaments including the Andriesz Shield and Pioneer Cup. This coincided with a time in which Sri Lankan hockey could compete ably with the best teams in the world. Since then, however, the hockey fortunes of both the club and National team have declined considerably, possibly due to the increasing popularity and financial resources aimed at the country's cricketing success.\nIn 1935, the club celebrated its 35th anniversary in grand style with a carnival and sports meet that culminated in a garden party at Campbell Park. This was one of the last major events held by the Club on these grounds before relocation. The occasion was a great success and well attended by patrons, politicians, sportsmen and businessmen. In 1937, the club acquired its new grounds and pavilion named the Colombo Oval, later renamed the Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium in honour of its Club stalwart for his tireless efforts in convince the Government to donate the grounds to the club. His Excellency Sir Reginald Edward Stubbs, the Governor of Ceylon officially opened the Colombo Oval on 27 January 1940. In the intervening years, Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu was instrumental in preparing the grounds to the standard of first class cricket, cultivating a superb playing area out of land that resembled a marshy swamp, with the kind assistance of the Minister of Agriculture and Lands, Mr D.S. Senanayake (later the first Prime Minister of Sri Lanka). For his efforts, Mr Senanayake was named an honorary member of the Tamil Union.\nBeginning in the 1960s, under the leadership of Somasunderam Skandakumar and Selva Perumal the club began to expand its base of cricketing talent by looking further afield than Colombo. This strategy paid dividends as the club soon began to nurture several young talents (many from extremely humble backgrounds) into international cricketers, including Upul Chandana. Perhaps the most illustrious international cricketer the club has produced is the leading wicket taker in international cricket history, Muttiah Muralitharan who amassed 800 Test wickets in 133 matches for Sri Lanka. Other notable players include former Sri Lankan Captain Tillakaratne Dilshan one of the all-time greats of Sri Lankan cricket, Mahadevan Sathasivam who captained the Tamil Union when it was first granted First-class cricket status and lead All-Ceylon in the 1940s before emigrating to Singapore to Captain its National Cricket Team, and Rangana Herath a world-class Spin bowler. Current Club captain is Chanaka Welegedara who has played 21 Test matches for Sri Lanka.\nIn 1981, Sri Lanka gained full member status of the International Cricket Council (ICC) and shortly thereafter played its first Test match at the headquarters of the Tamil Union, by this time renamed Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium. Mr T. Murugaser and Mr C. T. A. Schaffter were highly praised for their efforts in ensuring the occasion was a resounding success. Tragedy was to strike barely two years later, however, when the Oval was burned down during the 1983 riots during Black July. In spite of this the club was still able to host regular international cricket, including Sri Lanka's first ever Test match triumph over India in 1985.\nFrom the mid-1990s the P. Saravanamuttu Oval saw a hiatus of International cricket due to expansive renovations and improvements in facilities at the ground. The new developments include a state of the art media centre, gym, pool, players dressing area, bar and lounge as well as new two- tiered stands named for prominent members of the club, Dr Ranjan Chanmugam, M.Sathasivam and Sathi Coomaraswamy, an All-Ceylon cricketer and son of C. Coomaraswamy, Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India. These facilities and the club's history, together with the successes of its cricket team (regularly winning BCCSL national tournaments) in recent years maintain the club's status as one of the foremost sports clubs in the country.\nSince its inception, the Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic club would go on to have strong ties with the various governing bodies of national sport. For instance, Dr John Rockwood, the first honorary general secretary of the club also became the first president of the Ceylon Cricket Association. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, club president (1948–51) whose family were instrumental to the club's successes for several decades, was president of both the Ceylon Cricket Association and its successor the Board of Control for Cricket (1948–1950). W.M. Sellayah, honorary general secretary of the club (1932–36) also held the same position with the Ceylon Hockey Association and Ceylon Cricket Association. CTA Schafter a club captain and double international (played hockey and cricket) went on to be manager of the Sri Lankan Cricket team in the new millennium. In the 1980s, T. Murugaser, club president (1980–81) also held the vice presidency of the Board of Control for Cricket. Thus, the club has contributed a great deal to the administration of sport in Sri Lanka over the years.\nHonours.\n1945–46, 1950–51, 2015–16\n1999–00\nCurrent squad.\nThese players featured in matches for Tamil Union C &amp; AC in 2019/20\nPlayers with international caps are listed in bold"

        "text": "Jim Montgomery (born June 30, 1969) is a Canadian professional ice hockey coach and former player who is the head coach of the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL). Originally undrafted by teams in the NHL, he played a total of six seasons for the St. Louis Blues, Montreal Canadiens, Philadelphia Flyers, San Jose Sharks, and Dallas Stars.\nPlaying career.\nMontgomery played for the Cégep de Saint-Laurent Patriotes in Montreal in 1987–1988, before joining the Pembroke Lumber Kings, junior A hockey team in the Central Canada Hockey League in 1988–1989. The following season he joined the University of Maine and played 4 years with the team, winning numerous awards and establishing himself as one of the best prospects in hockey. Most notably he was named an All-Star 3 years (1991, 1992, 1993) and was named NCAA tournament championship MVP when he captained Maine to a record of 42–1–2 and the 1993 National Championship. His three third-period goals lifted the Black Bears to a 5–4 comeback win over Lake Superior State in the title game. Montgomery finished his career at Maine as the school's all-time leading scorer with 301 points on 103 goals and 198 assists. His number 19 was retired by Maine, one of three players who have that honour, the others being Hobey Baker Award winners Scott Pellerin (#8) and Paul Kariya (#9).\nFollowing college, Montgomery was signed by the St. Louis Blues. For the 1993–94 season he skated in 67 contests and scored 20 points, both NHL career highs. Following the season the highly touted Montgomery was traded to the Montreal Canadiens for Guy Carbonneau. For the 1994–95 season however things did not work out and after just 5 games Montgomery was released by the Canadiens. Later in the year he was signed by the Philadelphia Flyers and skated in 8 regular season contests and 7 playoff contests with the Flyers. Montgomery is credited with nicknaming the dominant line of John LeClair, Eric Lindros, and Mikael Renberg the \"Legion of Doom\". The 1995–96 season saw Montgomery play only 5 games with the Flyers but he had a career year with the Flyers minor league affiliate Hershey Bears of the AHL. He scored 105 points in 78 games and was named to the AHL Second All-Star Team.\nIt would be another 4 years before Montgomery would return to the NHL. He played in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL) in Germany for the 1996–97 season, followed by two full years with the Philadelphia Phantoms. For The 1999–2000 season Montgomery played part of the year with the Phantoms and spent the majority of the year with the Manitoba Moose.\nIn 2000, Montgomery was signed by the San Jose Sharks. He played the majority of the 2000–01 season with the Kentucky Thoroughblades but also skated in 28 games with the Sharks. The following year he was signed by the Dallas Stars and played 9 games with the team over two years, spending most of his time with the Utah Grizzlies. Montgomery then played one year in Russia and one year with the Missouri River Otters before retiring in 2005.\nCoaching career.\nMontgomery was an assistant coach for Notre Dame for the 2005–06 season. In 2006, Montgomery began a four-year stint as assistant coach at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. On April 12, 2010, he was named head coach of the United States Hockey League (USHL) expansion franchise Dubuque Fighting Saints. In the team's first year, Montgomery guided the Fighting Saints to a 37–14–9 record and the 2010–11 USHL championship with a three games to one victory over the Green Bay Gamblers. He went on to win the Clark Cup again during the 2012–13 season. In 2013, Montgomery was signed by University of Denver as head coach of their Pioneers men's ice hockey team and led them to a berth in the NCAA tournament. He led the Pioneers to the 2016 Frozen Four. In 2017, his fourth year as the head coach of the Pioneers, he led them to the National Championship game after establishing them as the first-seeded team in the country for the majority of the season. In 2016–17 season he was named the Spencer Penrose national coach of the year.\nDallas Stars (2018–2019).\nOn May 4, 2018, Montgomery was named as the head coach of the Dallas Stars of the National Hockey League (NHL). He led the Stars to their first playoff appearance in three years.\nOn December 10, 2019, the Stars fired Montgomery for \"unprofessional conduct inconsistent with the core values and beliefs of the Dallas Stars and the National Hockey League.\" At a press conference, general manager Jim Nill said the situation had come to light the previous weekend, and involved \"a material act of unprofessionalism\" egregious enough to demand Montgomery's immediate firing. He did not offer specifics \"out of respect for everyone involved,\" only saying that it did not involve abuse of players or criminal conduct. Rick Bowness, who joined the team a month after Montgomery's hiring in May 2018, was named interim coach, while Derek Laxdal (who was the head coach of the Texas Stars at the time) would be promoted to the assistant coaching position that was vacated by Bowness.\nAccording to Sportsnet's Elliotte Friedman, Montgomery was fired for \"a personal behaviour issue,\" and the Stars were not divulging details to protect the privacy of both the whistleblower and Montgomery's family. Montgomery told WFAA in Dallas that \"there will be a time\" when he speaks about the circumstances that led to his firing.\nOn January 3, 2020, Montgomery announced that he had checked himself into rehab to deal with alcohol abuse. He said that the Stars had made \"an appropriate call\" in firing him, and that his dismissal made him realize he was living a \"damaging lifestyle.\" On January 7, the \"Fort Worth Star-Telegram\" reported that Montgomery was fired in part due to concerns about his drinking. Nill had reportedly confronted Montgomery on numerous occasions about drinking in public. The Stars had been aware of Montgomery's history with alcohol; he had been arrested for DUI in 2008 during his time at RPI.\nSt. Louis Blues (2020–2022).\nOn September 16, 2020, the St. Louis Blues signed Montgomery to a two-year contract, serving as assistant coach under Craig Berube.\nBoston Bruins (2022–present).\nOn June 30, 2022, the Boston Bruins named Montgomery head coach, replacing Bruce Cassidy. Montgomery's \"positive coaching\" was widely assessed as a significant shift from his predecessor's approach, and lead to major improvements in the team for the 2022–23 season. The Bruins finished with a 65–12–5 record and 135 points, breaking both the previous record for wins (62), jointly held by the 2018–19 Tampa Bay Lightning and the 1995–96 Detroit Red Wings, and for points (132), previously set by the 1976–77 Montreal Canadiens. The team received the Presidents' Trophy, while Montgomery won the Jack Adams Award as NHL coach of the year.\nThe Bruins entered the 2023 Stanley Cup playoffs as the favourites for the championship. However, they were ousted in the first round by the Florida Panthers, squandering a 3–1 series lead in the process. The series was dubbed \"one of the worst choke jobs in Boston sports history.\" Much recrimination ensued about Montgomery's coaching decisions, in particular the choice to depart from the team's regular season goalie rotation between Linus Ullmark and Jeremy Swayman to playing Ullmark exclusively despite him dealing with an injury. Ullmark defended Montgomery, saying \"something that everybody does when things aren't going the way they want to is they're trying to find a scapegoat.\""

        "title": "List of Olympic Games host cities",
        "text": "This is a list of host cities of the Olympic Games, both summer and winter, since the modern Olympics began in 1896. Since then, summer and winter games have usually celebrated a four-year period known as an Olympiad; summer and winter games normally held in staggered even years. There have been 29 Summer Olympic Games held in 21 cities, and 24 Winter Olympic Games held in 21 cities. In addition, three summer and two winter editions of the games were scheduled to take place but later cancelled due to war: Berlin (summer) in 1916; Sapporo–Garmisch-Partenkirchen (winter) and Tokyo–Helsinki (summer) in 1940; and Cortina d'Ampezzo (winter) and London (summer) in 1944. The 1906 Intercalated Olympics were officially sanctioned and held in Athens. However, in 1949, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided to unrecognize the 1906 Games. The 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo were postponed for the first time in the Olympics history to summer 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic with the 2022 Winter Olympics being held roughly six months later in Beijing.\nFour cities have been chosen by the IOC to host upcoming Olympic Games: Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics, Milan–Cortina d'Ampezzo for the 2026 Winter Olympics, Los Angeles for the 2028 Summer Olympics, and Brisbane for the 2032 Summer Olympics.\nIn 2022, Beijing became the first city that has held both the summer and the winter Olympic Games. Ten cities will have hosted the Olympic Games more than once: Athens (1896 and 2004 Summer Olympics), Paris (1900, 1924 and 2024 Summer Olympics), London (1908, 1948 and 2012 Summer Olympics), St. Moritz (1928 and 1948 Winter Olympics), Lake Placid (1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics), Los Angeles (1932, 1984 and 2028 Summer Olympics), Cortina d'Ampezzo (1956 and 2026 Winter Olympics), Innsbruck (1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics), Tokyo (1964 and 2020 Summer Olympics) and Beijing (2008 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics). Stockholm hosted the 1912 Summer Olympics and the equestrian portion of the 1956 Summer Olympics. London became the first city to have hosted three Games with the 2012 Summer Olympics. Paris will become the second city to do this with the 2024 Summer Olympics, followed by Los Angeles as the third in 2028.\nThe Games have primarily been hosted in the regions of Europe (30 editions) and the Americas (13 editions); eight Games have been hosted in Asia and two have been hosted in Oceania. Rio de Janeiro became South America's first Olympic host city with the 2016 Summer Olympics. Africa has yet to host an Olympic Games. Other major geographic regions which have never hosted the Olympics include the Middle East, Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, the South Pacific, Central America and the Caribbean. Between the first Winter Olympics in 1924 and the last ones to be held in the same year as the Summer Olympics in 1992, the Summer and Winter games took place in the same country three times.\nHost cities are selected by the IOC membership, usually seven years in advance. The selection process lasts approximately two years. In the first stage, any city in the world may submit an application to become a host city. After 10 months, the Executive Board of the IOC decides which applicant cities will become official candidates as based on the recommendation of a working group that reviews the applications. In a second stage, the candidate cities are investigated thoroughly by an Evaluation Commission, which then submits a final short list of cities to be considered for selection. The host city is then chosen by vote of the IOC session, a general meeting of IOC members.\nOlympic Games host cities.\nHost cities for Summer and Winter Olympic Games.\n Cancelled\n Postponed"

        "text": "Paul Dunn (born 7 August 1963) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1980s and 1990s. A New South Wales State of Origin and Australian international representative forward, he played club football in Sydney for Eastern Suburbs, Canterbury-Bankstown, Parramatta and Penrith.\nBackground.\nDunn was born in the small town of Molong in central-west New South Wales. He later grew up in both Orange and Bathurst. Dunn moved to Sydney at the age of 19, where he played one season with Bondi United.\nProfessional playing career.\nIn 1983, Dunn began his first-grade career in the NSWRL premiership with Sydney's Eastern Suburbs club, where he played for two years before moving to the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, playing 100 games for the club over five seasons. At the end of the 1986 NSWRL season, he was selected to represent his country on the Kangaroo tour. A major player and staff change at Canterbury prompted a move to the Penrith Panthers in 1991, where Dunn spent two years before moving to the Parramatta Eels. He retired at the end of 1995 before returning for one year to his first club, the newly re-branded Sydney City Roosters.\nIn 1988, Dunn was the recipient of the Clive Churchill Medal for his man-of-the-match performance at in the Grand Final-winning Canterbury team. Dunn also won another premiership with Penrith in 1991. Following this grand final victory, he travelled with the Panthers to England for the 1991 World Club Challenge which was lost to Wigan.\nDunn also played in the City Firsts side in 1985 and 1986, and the City Origin side in 1987 and 1990, due to having played his last year of junior football for Bondi United, a Sydney-based club. He also played in the Country Origin sides of 1988, 1989 and 1991 because of his country roots. Dunn played one State of Origin game for New South Wales in 1988, and two games in 1989, along with seven Tests and five World Cup matches for Australia between 1986 and 1988, but found it hard to press for further representative honours in an era dominated by powerful forwards including Steve Roach, David Gillespie, Paul Harragon, Paul Sironen and John Cartwright.\nPost-playing career.\nIn 2000, Dunn was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league. Appointed the chief executive of the newly re-instituted South Sydney Rabbitohs, Dunn departed the club after its disappointing return season of 2002 due to unrest within the organisation. In 2008, Dunn was appointed to the club board of Canterbury-Bankstown. The following year, the Bulldogs reached the preliminary final after narrowly missing the minor premiership. In 2010, he was made deputy chairman of the club."

        "text": "The 1990 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament began on March 11 and ended on April 1. The tournament featured 48 teams. The Final Four consisted of Virginia, Stanford, Auburn, and Louisiana Tech, with Stanford defeating Auburn 88-81 to win its first NCAA title. Stanford's Jennifer Azzi was named the Most Outstanding Player of the tournament.\nNotable events.\nForty-eight teams started the tournament on the eleventh of March. Thirteen days later, there were four team left, Virginia, Auburn, Louisiana Tech and Stanford, headed to Knoxville, Tennessee for the Final Four.\nStanford, after playing in the initial 1982 tournament, did not qualify between 1983 and 1987, but had reached the Sweet Sixteen in 1988, and the Elite Eight in 1989. Virginia was competing in their seventh consecutive NCAA tournament, finishing as high as the Elite Eight in 1988. However, they had been knocked out of the tournament by Tennessee in each of the last three tournaments.\nAuburn, coached by Joe Ciampi, had been to all but one of the NCAA tournaments, and reached the last two Final Fours, but finished in the Runner-up position in each year. Louisiana Tech had not just played in every NCAA tournament, but had reached at least the Elite Eight every year, and had two national championships.\nFor the fourth consecutive year, Virginia faced Tennessee in the tournament. The previous three match ups were all won by Tennessee, including an 80–37 win in the 1989 tournament. This time, led by Dawn Staley who would win the MVP for her performance in the East Regional, the Cavaliers took the Volunteers to overtime, and won 79–75. Virginia next faced Stanford, who had only lost one game all season, and reached the final four by beating Arkansas 114–87 in the West Regional. Stanford wouldn't lose this game, and prevailed over Virginia 75–66.\nIn the other semi-final game, Auburn faced Louisiana Tech. Auburn came into the tournament as the prior year's runner-up, but was a two seed in the bracket with Washington, the only team to beat Stanford during the regular season. Auburn won easily, beating the Huskies 76–50. The Tech team, only two years removed from their last national championship, were a 1 seed and beat Texas to advance to the Final Four. Auburn was too strong for the Lady Techsters, and advanced to the championship game with an 81–69 victory.\nOver twenty thousand people bought tickets for the championship game in Knoxville, the largest crowd ever (at the time) to watch a women's basketball game. In 1985, Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer had traveled to Knoxville to meet with the family of Jennifer Azzi, to try to persuade Azzi to come to Stanford. Despite finishing 9–19 the year before, VanDerveer talked about competing for a national championship, Azzi came to Stanford, and four years later, was twenty miles from her Oak Ridge hometown, playing for the national championship. Auburn, led by Caroline Jones, pulled out to a nine-point lead in the first half. Then Azzi, who had not been able to even take a shot in the first eleven minutes, took over. She brought the team to a tie at halftime, and helped lead a 9–2 run early in the second half to take over the game. Azzi would win the tournament award for the most outstanding player, and her teammate Katy Steding set three point shooting records to help Stanford win their first national championship 88–81, while Auburn would finish as runner-up for the third consecutive year.\nRecords.\nKaty Steding set the Final Four record for both three points field goal attempts (15) and three point field goals made (6), in the championship game against Auburn.\nStanford set the NCAA Women's Tournament record for assist in a single games, with 37 assists in their regional final game against Arkansas.\nQualifying teams – automatic.\nForty-eight teams were selected to participate in the 1990 NCAA Tournament. Twenty-one conferences were eligible for an automatic bid to the 1990 NCAA tournament.\nQualifying teams – at-large.\nTwenty-seven additional teams were selected to complete the forty-eight invitations.\nBids by conference.\nTwenty-one conferences earned an automatic bid. In eleven cases, the automatic bid was the only representative from the conference. Two conferences (North Star, Big West) sent two representatives as an at-large team. Twenty-four additional at-large teams were selected from ten of the conferences.\nFirst and second rounds.\nIn 1990, the field remained at 48 teams. The teams were seeded, and assigned to four geographic regions, with seeds 1-12 in each region. In Round 1, seeds 8 and 9 faced each other for the opportunity to face the 1 seed in the second round, seeds 7 and 10 played for the opportunity to face the 2 seed, seeds 5 and 12 played for the opportunity to face the 4 seed, and seeds 6 and 11 played for the opportunity to face the 3 seed. In the first two rounds, the higher seed was given the opportunity to host the first-round game. In most cases, the higher seed accepted the opportunity. The exception:\nThe following table lists the region, host school, venue and the thirty-two first and second round locations:\nRegionals and Final Four.\nThe regionals, named for the general location, were held from March 22 to March 24 at these sites:\nEach regional winner advanced to the Final Four, held March 30 and April 1 in Knoxville, Tennessee at the Thompson-Boling Arena (Host: University of Tennessee)\nBids by state.\nThe forty-eight teams came from thirty states.\nCalifornia and Illinois had the most teams with four each. Twenty states did not have any teams receiving bids.\nBrackets.\nFirst- and second-round games played at higher seed except where noted.\nRecord by conference.\nFifteen conferences had more than one bid, or at least one win in NCAA Tournament play:\nEight conferences went 0-1: Big Eight, Big Sky Conference, Colonial, Gateway, MAAC, MAC, Southern Conference, and WAC"

There is one playoff rounds, and the winner of the finals round becomes the champion of the Kosovo Basketball Superleague. This is similar to the most basketball leagues in Europe.\nEach season, the last qualified team of the regular season relegates to Kosovo Basketball First League and replaced by champion of the First League whilst second from last of Superleague meats the runner up of the First League in e Relegation Playoff.\nForeigners.\nEach team can play 3 foreign players in every match that is organized by BFK.\nYoungsters.\nEvery team must play two U20 players in every game for at least 20 min otherwise the teams are fined 500 €.\nArena standards.\nSince the establishment of the league, the indoor courts in Kosovo have seen continuous improvements in capacity and facilities, with some municipalities have built and newly built stadiums for basketball clubs in their areas as well as other sports. Today, the facilities of the clubs participating in Kosovo Basketball Superleague and hosting the home matches, must have a minimum capacity of 1,000 people.\nHistory.\nDespite the political status of Kosovo, basketball competitions have been legally organized since 1999 under the Basketball Federation of Kosovo licensed by the United Nations Mission in Kosovo and the Government of Kosovo. However, the KBF has functioned since 1991 and organized amateur basketball leagues.\nToday, basketball in Kosovo shares the same popularity with football.\nWinner by season.\nHere is the list of the champions of Kosovo year by year \nSponsorships and broadcasting rights.\nOfficial sponsors\nOfficial broadcasters"

During the 1910–11 and 1912–13 seasons Scott played for his home town club Moncton Victorias.\nScott later played with two National Hockey Association teams, the Toronto Ontarios in 1913–1914, and the Montreal Canadiens in 1913–1914 and 1914–1915.

        "text": "Henry James Smith (December 29, 1883 – May 6, 1953) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player who played 98 games in various professional and amateur leagues, including the National Hockey Association and Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association. Among the teams he played with were the Cobalt Silver Kings, Toronto Tecumsehs, Ottawa Senators, and Montreal Wanderers. He was a member of the famous \"Ottawa Silver Seven\" from 1905 to 1907. His brothers Alf and Tommy also played ice hockey.\nPlaying career.\nHarry Smith first played senior-level hockey with the Ottawa Aberdeens of the CAHL-Intermediate league in 1901. He played for Arnprior of the Upper Ottawa Valley Hockey League before joining Smiths Falls of the Southern Ontario Hockey Association. He played two seasons with Smiths Falls before returning home to play in Ottawa with the Ottawa Senators, already the Stanley Cup champion. He played two seasons with the \"Silver Seven\" with his brother Alf who was playing-coach. In the 1905–06 season, Alf, Harry and brother Tommy all played for the Silver Seven, occasionally playing together on one line.\nSmith was known as a rough player. In 1907 Smith and teammates Alf Smith and Charles Spittal were charged with assault after beating Montreal Wanderers players Hod Stuart, Ernie \"Moose\" Johnson and Cecil Blachford with their sticks. Harry Smith was acquitted while Spittal and Alf Smith were each fined $20. When Smith played in an exhibition game with the Winnipeg Maple Leafs against the Winnipeg Hockey Club on December 19, 1907, the Winnipeg Hockey Club players refused to carry on the contest after it had degenerated into a number of violent displays, the last of which involved blows between Harry Smith and Winnipeg Hockey Club defenseman Percy Browne. He was subsequently expelled from the MHA along with Maple Leafs teammate Joe Hall.\nSmith was also known to have one of the better shots in the game during his era, which helped him score many goals.\nHe became a professional player in 1907–08 with the Pittsburgh Bankers of the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League (WPHL). On February 15, 1908, he was involved in a riot with spectators in a game against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club at the Duquesne Gardens where he went into the stands swinging his stick after he had been hit on the ice by a chair thrown by a spectator. In 1908–09 he was a 'for hire' player playing for the Bankers, Toronto Pros (OPHL), Haileybury Comets (TPHL) and Montreal Wanderers (ECHA), where he was member of the Wanderers 1909 Stanley Cup challenge championship squad, although the team did not hold the Cup at the end of the season.\nIn December 1909, prior to the 1909–10 season, Smith was badly scalded on one if his legs by the bursting of a valve in a steam engine while working for his father Henry in Fort William. He was laid up in hospital for several days, and it was first thought that he would not be able to play any hockey during the season, but he did play later on for both the Cobalt Silver Kings and the Haileybury Comets in the National Hockey Association.\nHe moved on to the Waterloo Colts of the OPHL in 1911, the Schreiber Colts in 1912, before returning to the NHA with the Toronto Tecumsehs. He returned to Ottawa in 1913–14, playing two games with the Ottawa Hockey Club (now known as the \"Senators\") before ending his career with the Halifax Crescents of the Maritime Professional Hockey League (MPHL).\nHe died at Ottawa in 1953.\nStatistics.\n\"Statistics per Society for International Hockey Research at sihrhockey.org\""

He had previously served as the head men's basketball coach at Rutgers University. His father is Rutgers baseball coach Fred Hill Sr. and his uncle, Brian Hill is a former NBA coach.\nRaised in Verona, New Jersey, Hill graduated from Verona High School in 1977.\nHill had a 47–77 record in four years at Rutgers. He recruited and lost 12 players including Mike Rosario, the first McDonald's All American in Rutgers history.\nDespite a losing record, Hill had been told after the 2009–10 season that he would return for a fifth season. However, on April 1, Hill got into a shouting match with Pittsburgh baseball coaches after a game between the Panthers and Scarlet Knights. When athletic director Tim Pernetti learned about it, he ordered Hill to stay away from the remaining games of the Panthers-Scarlet Knights series. Hill showed up for the next day's game, prompting an investigation by Pernetti. After the investigation, Pernetti told Hill he would not be allowed to return. After protracted negotiations, Hill was allowed to resign in return for an $850,000 settlement."

He is sometimes referred to as the Dean of the Big West Conference's basketball coaches. He was previously the head coach at the UC Davis, winning the NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Championship in 1998. Williams is the all-time winningest coach at UC Santa Barbara with a 19-year record of 313–260.\nCoaching career.\nPrior to his arrival at UCSB, Williams spent eight years at UC Davis. His UC Davis teams recorded 20 or more wins five times and had an eight-year record of 158–76 record. In Williams’ final season at UC Davis, the Aggies went 31–2, won the NCAA Division II National Championship. Williams was named NABC Division II Coach of the Year.\nWilliams took over a UCSB program that had not recorded a winning season in five years. In 1998–99, the Gauchos won 15 games and won the West division of the Big West. The 2002 Gauchos won the school’s first Big West tournament title, advancing to the NCAA tournament. In 2003, they won the league’s regular season title and played in the NIT. In 2007–08, UCSB set the all time school record for most wins in a season with 23. They won the Big West regular season title for a second time and received a bid to the 2008 NIT.\nThe 2009–10 season marked the fourth Big West Regular Season title captured during Williams' tenure at UCSB. It also was the first time in the basketball program's history that the Gauchos won both the Big West Regular Season and Big West tournament championships in the same year. Williams was also awarded the 2010 Big West Coach of the Year Award, his third. It marked the school's second trip to the NCAA tournament under Williams.\nOn Feb. 5, 2011, he recorded his 400th career win when his team defeated UC Davis. The 2011 team also garnered their second consecutive NCAA tournament bid. Williams became UCSB’s all-time leader in coaching victories when, on January 2, 2012, his team defeated Cal Poly. The 2015–16 Gauchos were invited to play at the inaugural Vegas 16 at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. The postseason bid was the eighth for the program under Williams and a victory over Northern Illinois in the first round was its first postseason win since 1990.\nFollowing a disappointing 2016–17 season, Williams was informed that he would not return as head coach after 19 years with the school."

Already in 1911 an effort was made by a group of tennis players, headed by Karl H. Behr from New York, to relocate the tournament to New York but by a vote of 95 to 60 it was decided to remain in Newport. In early 1915 the issue resurfaced when a group of about 100 tennis players signed a petition in favor of the move, arguing that most tennis clubs, players and fans were located in the New York area and that it would therefore be beneficial for the development of the sport to host the national championship there. This view was opposed by another group of players which included eight former national singles champions. The contentious issue was brought to a vote at the annual United States National Lawn Tennis Association (USNLTA) meeting on February 5, 1915 and with 128 votes in favor and 119 against it was decided to relocate to Forest Hills.\nFinals.\nMen's singles.\n William Johnston defeated Maurice McLoughlin 1–6, 6–0, 7–5, 10–8\nWomen's singles.\n Molla Bjurstedt defeated Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman 4–6, 6–2, 6–0\nMen's doubles.\n William Johnston / Clarence Griffin defeated Maurice McLoughlin / Tom Bundy 2–6, 6–3, 6–4, 3–6, 6–3\nWomen's doubles.\n Hazel Wightman / Eleonora Sears defeated Helen Homans McLean / G.

It was the 37th staging of the U.S. National Championships and due to World War I the only Grand Slam tennis event of the year.\nNational Patriotic Tournament.\nThe tournament was renamed National Patriotic Tournament in support of the war effort. No trophies were handed out to the winners and the entrance fees were dedicated to the American Red Cross. Robert Lindley Murray defeated Bostonian Nathaniel W. Niles in four sets in the men's final.\nIn the commemorative book 'Fifty Years of Lawn Tennis in the United States', published by the USLTA in 1931, Lindley Murray commented on the final: \"I succeeded in beating Nat Niles 5–7, 8–6, 6–3, 6–3, plenty of indication that the match was close and hard fought. I remember well that, try as I would, I could not get into the full swing of my game those first two sets. This was because my opponent was driving beautifully, particularly low, fast ones to my backhand. In addition he was lobbing so accurately and deeply that, try as I would, I could not bring off my kills. Nat led me one set to love and 6–5 in the second set. which was mighty close to being two sets down. But about that time my game began to get going. Up until that time I had just been missing and while desperately dashing all over the court my shots would end in just hitting the net or just going out. From the twelfth game of the second set, on for the rest of the match, things began to go right, and at the end I felt as if I was playing as well as I know how.\"\nFinals.\nMen's singles.\n Robert Lindley Murray defeated Nathaniel W.

The tournament ran from September 2 until September 9, 1940. It was the 60th staging of the U.S. National Championships and the second Grand Slam tennis event of the year because of the cancellation of Wimbledon and the French Championships due to World War II. Don McNeill capped an outstanding season with his win over Bobby Riggs in the finals of the men's singles. Earlier in the year McNeill won the U.S. Men's Intercollegiate Singles Championships for Kenyon College, defeating Joe Hunt of Navy. A dramatic moment occurred in this 1940 National Championships during the men's singles quarter-final match between 1943 national champion, Joe Hunt and third seeded Frank Kovacs. Kovacs had the reputation as a court clown, and early in the third set, Kovacs' antics with the gallery compelled Hunt to sit down on the baseline and refuse to play until the umpire stopped the disturbance. Hunt ignored several of Kovacs' serves, allowing them to harmlessly fly by. In short order, Kovacs also sat on his baseline and Forest Hills experienced what was called \"tennis' first sit-down strike.\" About five minutes went by with the crowd alternately cheering and jeering. When order was restored, Hunt went on to win the match in straight sets. \nFinals.\nMen's singles.\n Donald McNeill defeated Bobby Riggs 4–6, 6–8, 6–3, 6–3, 7–5\nWomen's singles.\n Alice Marble defeated Helen Jacobs 6–2, 6–3\nMen's doubles.\n Jack Kramer / Ted Schroeder defeated Gardnar Mulloy / Henry Prusoff 6–4, 8–6, 9–7 \nWomen's doubles.\n Sarah Palfrey Cooke / Alice Marble defeated Dorothy Bundy / Marjorie Gladman Van Ryn 6–4, 6–4 \nMixed doubles.\n Alice Marble / Bobby Riggs defeated Dorothy Bundy / Jack Kramer 9–7, 6–1 "

Floyd appeared at both safety spots (both free safety and strong safety). Bill Verigan of the New York \"Daily News\" projected \"only a very few, perhaps three or four\" of the Jets' new players to make the team. Floyd made the team after final cuts. \nDuring the 1982 NFL strike, Floyd worked out at EKU; when he returned to New York, he worked in construction, installing windows in skyscrapers.

During the preseason, Floyd moved from safety to cornerback, and averaged 15.2 yards per return as a punt returner and 30.2 yards per return as a kickoff returner, with one interception. In a preseason game against the New Orleans Saints, Floyd suffered a sprained knee on a kickoff return he fumbled. The Jets placed Floyd on their injured reserve list (IRL), and Floyd missed the entire 1983 season.\nFloyd was placed on the IRL again before the 1984 season with a hyperextended knee that bothered him intermittently throughout the preseason. He was activated from the IRL in late October, and became a starter in early November for injured right cornerback Russell Carter. Paul Needell of the New York \"Daily News\" described Floyd as the fifth-best corner on the Jets by the time he was a starter, and Rowe described Floyd and Mullen as the Achilles' heel of the Jets defense on November 19. Over the course of the 1984 season, Floyd started two games for the Jets and appeared in eight as the team finished with a 7–9 record and missed the playoffs. In the 1985 preseason, Floyd re-injured his knee and was placed on the IRL.

        "text": "The combativity award is a prize given in the Tour de France for the most combative rider overall during the race. Historically, it favored constant attackers as it was based on the distance spent in a breakaway, included winning checkpoints and outright stage wins. Today, the winner is chosen by a jury. Besides the overall winner, the jury also awards a combativity award to the most aggressive rider at the end of each stage, with this rider allowed to wear a golden number the following race day.\nThe 1981 Tour de France marked the last time the winner of the general classification also won the combativity award.\nHistory.\nSince 1952, after every stage the most combative cyclist was given an award, and an overall competition was recorded. At the end of the 1956 Tour de France, André Darrigade was named the most attacking cyclist. At this point, the award was given the same importance as the award for the cyclist with the most bad luck, Picot in 1956.\nIn 1961, the award was not given to an individual cyclist, but to an entire team, the regional team West-South-West.\nThe system of the award has changed over the years. Historically, riders accumulated points, and the cyclist with the most points at the end of the Tour was declared the winner. The cyclist did not have to finish the race, for example in 1971 Luis Ocaña crashed out while wearing the yellow jersey on the Col de Menté in stage 14 and in 1972 Cyrille Guimard was wearing the green jersey and in 2nd place overall when he withdrew, but both were still given the combativity award.\nIn 1979, the combativity award was initially given to Joop Zoetemelk; however Hennie Kuiper received the final award.\nIn a system that was implemented in 2003, a jury of eight specialists in cycling selected the most combative cyclist of each stage (excluding time trials), with the classification for most distance in breakaway groups only part of the decision.\nThere is no jersey for the most combative rider of the previous stage, but he can be recognized by the race number worn on his back: it consists of a black number on a golden background instead of the usual black on white. From 1998 until 2022, it consisted of a white number on a red background.\nAt the end of the Tour de France, a \"super-combativity award\" is given to the most combative cyclist of the race. , the total prize money for the super-combativity award winner is €20,000.\nFrom 2023, the number will be golden, following sponsorship by real estate company Century 21.\nWinners.\nOverall super-combativity award winners since 1953."

        "text": "The Skyrunner World Series is an annual international championship of skyrunning (high altitude endurance races) and the official International Skyrunning Federation (ISF) race circuit for mountain running. Each year the Skyrunner World Series presents a global Sky Racing calendar, attracting mountain running athletes from almost every country.\nHistory.\nSkyrunning was founded in 1992 by Italian Marino Giacometti, President of the International Skyrunning Federation which sanctions the discipline worldwide. The SWS was launched in 2004 and has grown to represent the peak of outdoor running defined by altitude and technicality. In 2017, Migu Run, an advanced online and offline exercise and health management platform founded in China, became title sponsor of the Migu Run Skyrunner World Series.\nDefinition of a Skyrunner World Series Sky Race.\nSkyrunning stands apart from other mountain running activities. The criteria of a SWS Sky Race are:\nAltitude (average and maximum reached), peak reach, running on snow/glacier, grade II climbing difficulty and increased elevation percentage are other factors also taken into account when defining a Sky Race.\n2019 rules and rankings.\nThe 2019 Skyrunner World Series proposes two ranking systems. The single season ranking, introduced in 2019 and limited to the Skyrunner World Series, and the 52-week ranking which encompasses all races, including the Skyrunner National Series races.\nThe single season ranking.\nIn 2019, the Skyrunner World Series introduced the first single ranking system. The objective of the general ranking is to unify the circuits and key races to make the series even more competitive and define who is the best Skyrunner in the World; a Skyrunner being someone able to face any type of mountain with technicality, speed and intensity, and serves as a base to distribute the end of season bonus pool.\nThe 2019 Skyrunner World Series season runs from April to October. It consists of 15 races in 11 countries and concludes with the \"SkyMasters\", the end of season race open only to qualified athletes.\nAthletes are ranked on their top 4 points results of the season, of which no more than 2 can be \"SuperSky Races\" - races rewarding twice as many points as a Sky Race, plus the SkyMasters points.\nAt each race, points will be attributed to the top twenty finishers in a symmetric manner for men and women according to the following grid:\nThe 52-week ranking.\nThe 52-week rolling ranking is a ranking based on results over the last 52 weeks. It includes the points earned in MRSWS and Skyrunner National Series and is updated every week. After 52 weeks, any result completely disappears.\nEnd of season bonus pool.\nThe end of season bonus pool increased from €66,000 in 2018 to €75,000 in 2019, split equally between the top 10 ranked male and female athletes of the season. To be eligible for the end of season bonus pool, athletes must participate in a minimum of four races, at least two must be Sky Races and start at the SkyMasters race.\n2018 Ranking system.\nFor the 2018 season, three rankings were published: Sky Classic, Sky Extra and Overall.\nSky Classic races were 22 km to 50 km long with 7.5% average elevation and a 1,000m difference of min/max. altitude. The Sky Classic ranking took into account the best five results of the season. The Sky Classic category champions were Pascal Egli from Switzerland and GBs Holly Page.\nSky Extra mixed races that were formerly known as Sky Ultra and Sky Extreme. These races were over 50 km long with 6.5% average elevation and 1,000m difference of min/max. altitude. The Sky Extra took into account the best four results of the season and was won by Pere Aurell of Spain and America's Hillary Gerardi.\nOverall - all athletes scoring points in any race entered the overall ranking. Their best two results in each category counted for the final ranking.\nPrevious overall champions.\nThat is the results of the singles races of the various years."

        "text": "Michael Kent Young (born May 1, 1963) is an American college basketball coach and currently the head men's basketball coach at Virginia Tech. He was hired on April 7, 2019, after a 17-year stint where he went 299–244 () as the head coach at Wofford College.\nCareer.\nBorn in Radford, Virginia, Young played collegiately at Emory &amp; Henry College. After completing his career, which included serving as team captain during his junior and senior seasons, Young began his coaching career as an assistant coach at his alma mater. In 1988, he left Emory &amp; Henry to serve one year as an assistant to Oliver Purnell at Radford University.\nIn 1989, Young began his tenure as an assistant coach at Wofford. He would go on to spend the next 30 years at the school, helping to guide the Terriers in their transition from Division II to Division I independent status, and finally to a spot in the Southern Conference, where the Terriers compete today.\nIn December 2001, Wofford announced that then-head coach Richard Johnson would be promoted to athletic director, leaving Young to take control of the team starting for the 2002–03 season. His first six years were fairly uneventful, with high points of a .500 conference record in his first season, and overall records of .500 during the 2004–05 and 2007–08 seasons.\nHowever, 2008–09 saw new school records in the Division I era, marking the Terriers' first winning season as a Division I school and the first winning SoCon record in school history. In 2009–10, Young continued to build on this success, leading the Terriers to the Southern Conference regular season and tournament championships, which earned Wofford its first bid to the NCAA tournament. In recognition of his achievements, Young was named the 2010 Southern Conference Coach of the Year , as well as the Hugh Durham National Coach of the Year .\nOn December 21, 2017, Young led Wofford to a stunning 79-75 win over #5 North Carolina, giving the program its first ever win over a top 25 team. The next season, it defeated Seton Hall 84-68 in the 2019 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament for the first NCAA Tournament win of Young's career. On November 5, 2019, Young recorded his 300th win, and first win as Virginia Tech's men's basketball coach, by defeating Clemson 67-60.\nOn November 20, 2019, Young led Virginia Tech to a 100-64 win over Delaware State, giving the program a new school record and also set an ACC record with its 21 3-pointers made. On November 25, 2019, Young led Virginia Tech to a 71-66 victory over No. 3 Michigan State in the Maui Invitational, Young's first victory over a ranked team as head coach of the Hokies. At the close of the 2020–21 regular season, Young was named the ACC Coach of the Year.\nOn March 12, 2022, Young led the Hokies to the ACC Tournament title for the first time in school history. The tournament final was played against Mike Krzyzewski's Duke Blue Devils in Coach K's final ACC tournament game. Tech, the seven seed, won 82-67 and only reached the final after beating Clemson, Notre Dame, and North Carolina in consecutive nights. The Hokies were the first seven seed to win the tournament in its long history.\nHead coaching record.\n "

        "title": "Craig Robinson (basketball)",
        "text": "Craig Malcolm Robinson (born April 21, 1962) is an American college basketball coach, basketball executive, and broadcaster. He is a former head men's basketball coach at Oregon State University and Brown University. He was a star forward as a player at Princeton University in the early 1980s and a bond trader during the 1990s. He currently is the Executive Director of the National Association of Basketball Coaches. He is former First Lady Michelle Obama's brother.\nEarly years.\nCraig Malcolm Robinson was born on April 21, 1962, in Calumet Park, Illinois, to Fraser Robinson, a city water plant employee and Democratic precinct captain, and Marian Robinson (\"née\" Shields), a secretary at Spiegel's catalog store. Robinson grew up in Chicago's South Shore with his younger sister, Former First Lady, Michelle Obama. He learned to read by the age of four at home and skipped the second grade in school. He attended the parochial Mount Carmel High School, graduating in 1979 as class valedictorian.\nWhen Robinson was considering what college to go to, his father insisted that he attend Princeton University for its Ivy League academics, rather than either the University of Washington or Purdue University, which offered scholarships and major basketball conference play.\nPlaying career.\nRobinson, who stands and played forward, was a two-time Ivy League Player of the Year at Princeton University, in 1981–1982 and 1982–1983, leading the league in field goal percentage both years. He is the fourth highest scorer in school history. He graduated in 1983 with a B.A. in Sociology. His senior thesis was on social stratification in prisons. Robinson and former teammate John W. Rogers, Jr. were among those invited to practice with Michael Jordan as he prepared for his comeback.\nRobinson was drafted in the fourth round of the 1983 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers, but never played in the league. He played professionally for the Manchester Giants in the British Basketball League for two seasons and returned to the U.S. in 1988 to become an assistant coach at the Illinois Institute of Technology, a position he held until 1990.\nBusiness career, marriages, and family.\nRobinson left basketball partly on the advice of his Princeton coach Pete Carril and pursued a business degree, earning an M.B.A. in Finance from the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business in 1992. Robinson worked in the 1990s as a bond trader. He became a vice president at Continental Illinois Bank and worked there from 1990 to 1992. He was then a vice president, from 1992 to 1999, at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Later, he was a managing director and partner at Loop Capital Markets, a minority-owned boutique investment banking firm.\nWhen Robinson's sister, Michelle, began dating her law firm colleague, Barack Obama, who played basketball recreationally, she asked her brother to play with Obama and give her a character assessment so that she would know whether she could become serious with him. He gave an encouraging report to her. As he later related, \"When I played basketball with Barack, he was quietly confident, which means he had good self-esteem without being cocky. He was certainly a team player – he wasn't a pig, he passed when he was supposed to pass, and he cut when he was supposed to cut. To me, that speaks to a lack of selfishness. He had natural leadership ability because he didn't just pass me the ball because he was dating my sister. Whenever a player gets tired, he reverts to the player he truly is. That's how you tell. And we played for hours. That's how I could tell.\" The story of this pick-up game and of a \"test\" being passed became a key part of the Obama narrative.\nWhile working in the business world, Robinson kept a hand in basketball by doing area scouting for Princeton and coaching one year at University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. He earned a high six-figure income in his business career, but he eventually decided the financial world had lost its appeal and found his luxury lifestyle was not enough to save his marriage to Janis Robinson. By 2000, Robinson was going through a divorce. Robinson has two children from his first marriage, a son Avery (born 1992) and a daughter Leslie (born 1996). Robinson remarried in June 2006 to his current wife Kelly. They became parents of sons Austin in 2010 and Aaron in 2012. His daughter Leslie played for the Princeton Tigers women's basketball team as a forward.\nBasketball career.\nRobinson returned to coaching in 1999, making one-tenth his former salary. He was an assistant for six years to Bill Carmody at Northwestern University, where he was an effective recruiter. He then became a head coach at Brown University in 2006, where he ran a variation of the Princeton offense which he learned from Pete Carril during his years at Princeton. In improving a mid-level basketball program, he stressed work ethic, used tough love, and tried to improve the players' vocabulary. Having placed fifth with a strong finish to the season garnered Robinson the Ivy League men's basketball Coach of the Year for the 2006–2007 season by Basketball-U.com. The following year, the Brown Bears finished second in the league, and their 19 wins for the season was a team record.\nRobinson assisted his brother-in-law throughout the latter's 2008 presidential campaign, including campaigning for him during the Iowa caucuses and campaigning and giving speeches for him in a number of other states, sometimes combining campaigning with recruiting visits. He introduced his sister Michelle before her speech on August 25, 2008, the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, which gave him his largest national exposure. He was also on stage following Obama's victory speech in Grant Park after his election as president on November 4, 2008.\nOn April 7, 2008, Robinson was hired as the Oregon State Beavers' head basketball coach following the team's winless Pacific-10 Conference record and overall 6–25 mark the year before. (Jesse Agel, Robinson's assistant of two years, took over Robinson's former position at Brown.)\nOregon State got off to a fairly good start in Robinson's first year, starting with a 6–6 record; a January 2009 conference win over USC broke a nearly two-year Pac-10 losing streak and earned Robinson a congratulatory call from his brother-in-law, then-President-elect Obama. Robinson continued his tough-love approach, tailored to strengthening each player's weaknesses. After that first win, Robinson's team won another six Pac-10 games, exceeding expectations for his first year on the job, given that his personnel were essentially unchanged from the team's prior year. One key was that the offensive system he installed raised the team's collective field goal percentage almost 10 points. Some commentators felt he was deserving of consideration for the Pac-10 Coach of the Year award, and by late February, Robinson had hopes of the team getting a bid from one of the postseason tournaments. The team was indeed accepted into the 2009 College Basketball Invitational, where it went on to post a 5–1 record and captured its first post-season tournament championship ever with a final series victory over the UTEP Miners. Of the win, Robinson said, \"I can't tell you how proud I am of these guys. ... This is a great story for anybody.\" The Beavers finished with an 18–18 record for the season and had what Rivals.com deemed a top-25 recruiting class as well.\nIn July 2009, President Obama alluded to the possibility of Robinson coaching elsewhere by saying: \"Craig Robinson is an outstanding coach. ... Anybody in Oregon and anybody who knows sports knows he turned it around. He loves Corvallis, and I'm sure that as a young, successful coach, he's going to start getting offers.\" Oregon State's 2009–10 season featured an inconsistent level of play in a conference dominated by parity, leading to an 8–10 regular-season conference record for a tie for fifth place. They then lost in the first round of the Pac-10 tournament. Despite the losing record, the team was invited to defend their championship at the 2010 College Basketball Invitational, but lacked focus and energy and were beaten easily in the first round, leaving them with an overall season record of 14–18.\nIn March 2010, shortly before the end of the season, the university and Robinson agreed on a two-year contract extension that would keep him in place through the 2015–16 season. In April 2010, Robinson published his memoir, \"A Game of Character: A Family Journey from Chicago's Southside to the Ivy League and Beyond\".\nThe 2010–2011 season was one of regression for Oregon State, with the team falling to a 5–13, ninth-place finish in the conference, and a sharply losing record overall. However, Robinson professed to not being overly worried or disappointed, saying he was encouraged by the development of some of the underclassmen. The Obamas showed their support for Robinson by attending an Oregon State game against Towson in November 2011. The 2011–2012 season saw a Robinson-era best for overall wins, 21, including a pair in the 2012 College Basketball Invitational, but a fourth consecutive losing record within the conference. It was the highest win total for the team since 1990, and the completion of it saw star guard Jared Cunningham leaving after his junior season and being selected in the NBA draft, the first Beaver to be drafted in over a decade. In June 2012, construction began on a $15 million basketball practice facility that Robinson and previous coaches had long been campaigning for.\nPrior to the 2012–2013 season, Robinson characterized his squad as \"probably the best team I've had.\" But the Beavers went in the opposite direction by suffering one of their worst seasons ever, with a penchant for second-half collapses and end-of-game failures. Attendance at Gill Coliseum fell to half capacity, and the student section lost enthusiasm. The team finished with a dead-last 4–14 record in the conference and a 14–18 mark overall. Fans began calling for a change in coaches, but the university athletic director said, \"Coach Robinson is our coach, and this administration is in full support of him.\" Following the season, Robinson appeared on the CBS Sports Network as a studio analyst during the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship tournament.\nThe 2013–2014 season saw the team improve to a 16–16 mark overall but have its sixth consecutive losing season in the conference. The team faced the loss of all five of its starters and its five top scorers following the season, due to graduation, transfers, and the like. In March 2014, the Pac-12 announced that Robinson would coach an all-star basketball team that would tour China in August. On May 5, 2014, Robinson was fired from his position as the Oregon State men's head basketball coach. He was given a $4 million buyout of the three remaining years on his contract. The team had failed to make the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship or the National Invitation Tournament during Robinson's tenure. His overall 93–104 record did make him the fourth-winningest coach in team history.\nThe Milwaukee Bucks hired Robinson as vice president of player and organizational development on August 15, 2016. After one season, he left the Bucks to join the New York Knicks in a similar position.\nBroadcasting career.\nOn October 7, 2014, ESPN announced the hiring of Robinson as a college basketball analyst. There, he began to work broadcasting games and doing studio work on ESPNU.\nAfter coaching.\nOn July 13, 2020, Robinson was named the Executive Director of the National Association of Basketball Coaches. \nPersonal life.\nRobinson is the older brother of former U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama and the brother-in-law of former U.S. President Barack Obama. Robinson has been married twice and has four children."

Rose retired from coaching BYU's men's basketball team on March 26, 2019.\nShortly before the start of what would be Rose's last season, the Cougars were stripped of all 47 wins over the 2015-16 and 2016-17 seasons after guard Nick Emery was retroactively declared ineligible for receiving impermissible benefits from boosters. Even with the vacated games, Rose is still the second-winningest coach in school history, behind only Stan Watts.\nPersonal life.\nRose and his wife, Cheryl, are the parents of three children. Rose served a full-time mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Manchester, England from 1977-79.

Previously, Kennedy was the head coach of the Texas A&amp;M University men's basketball team. He took over the position vacated by Mark Turgeon in May 2011. Prior to this, he held the same position at Murray State University for five seasons. Kennedy previously held the same position at Centenary and Southeastern Louisiana.

He played basketball and attended Holy Cross High School in New Orleans.\nCoaching career.\nCentenary.\nAfter serving 12 years as an assistant coach, including the previous four at California, Kennedy's first collegiate head coaching job came at Centenary. There, he took over a program that had won only 30 games in the previous three seasons. His first team won 10 games but his second improved to a 14-14 overall record and a 9-7 Trans America Athletic Conference mark, its best finish in five years.\nSoutheastern Louisiana.\nSoutheastern Louisiana hired Kennedy in 1999 and he steadily improved his alma mater, winning 10 games in his first season and doubling that total four seasons later, winning the Southland Conference regular-season championship. His sixth team went 24-9, the most wins in school history, and won both the conference regular-season and tournament titles. The Lions advanced to the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history, where it lost to Oklahoma State 63-50.\nThe Louisiana Sports Writers Association, the Louisiana Association of Basketball Coaches, and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (District 8) selected Kennedy coach of the year in 2004 end 2005.\nKennedy resigned from his position at Southeastern Louisiana to become the associate head coach at Miami.\nMurray State.\nAfter serving one season as an assistant at Miami, Kennedy was named Murray State's 14th men's basketball coach in 2006, taking over after Mick Cronin departed for Cincinnati. \nTaking over a team with only one returning starter, he led the Racers to a 16-14 season and second-place finish in the Ohio Valley Conference. His next two squads won 18 and 19 games, again placing second in the conference regular-season standings, and advanced as far as the OVC tournament semifinals.\nHis fourth team at Murray State won more games than any in school history, reaching the second round of the NCAA tournament.

The Aggies also made the SEC tournament final before losing to Kentucky in overtime. For his efforts, Kennedy was given a new 5-year contract. Coach Kennedy's squad that year also orchestrated the largest final-minute come-from-behind victory in college basketball history by overcoming a 12 point deficit in the final 34 seconds of the Second Round of the 2016 NCAA tournament. A&amp;M would tie up the game before finally defeating Northern Iowa in double overtime in order to advance to the Sweet 16 against the University of Oklahoma.\nKennedy led A&amp;M to a number five ranking early in the 2017-2018 season and the team finished with 20 regular season wins. The team advanced to the second round of the NCAA tournament to play defending National champion North Carolina, ultimately beating North Carolina by 21 points to advance to the Sweet 16 and a game against Michigan.\nAfter a disappointing 2018-19 season, losing four of five starters from the previous season also riddled with injuries and only seven scholarship players, he was fired at the conclusion of the season with two years remaining on his contract.\nWichita State.\nAfter Gregg Marshall's resignation from Wichita State, Kennedy was hired as an assistant for the 2020-21 season by the interim head coach Isaac Brown. While at Wichita State, Kennedy and his wife were recipients of the Coach Wooden \"Keys to Life\" Award in 2021."

        "text": "The 2007 IIHF World Championship rosters consisted of 393 players on 16 national ice hockey teams. Run by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), the Ice Hockey World Championships is the sport's highest-profile annual international tournament. The 2007 IIHF World Championship was the 71st edition of the tournament and was held in Moscow and Mytischi, Russia. Canada won the Championship, the 24th time they had done so.\nBefore the start of the World Championship, each participating nation had to submit a list of players for its roster. A minimum of fifteen skaters and two goaltenders, and a maximum of twenty skaters and three goaltenders had to be selected. If a country selects fewer than the maximum allowed, they must choose the remaining players prior to the start of the tournament. After the start of the tournament, each team was allowed to select an additional two players, either skaters or goaltenders, to their roster, for a maximum roster of 25 players. Once players were registered to the team, they could not be removed from the roster.\nTo qualify for a national team under IIHF rules, a player must follow several criteria. He must be a citizen of the nation, and be under the jurisdiction of that national association. Players are allowed to switch which national team they play for, providing they fulfill the IIHF criteria. If participating for the first time in an IIHF event, the player would have had to play two consecutive years in the national competition of the new country without playing in another country. If the player has already played for a national team before, he may switch countries if he is a citizen of the new country, and has played for four consecutive years in the national competition of the new country. This switch may only happen once in the player's life.\nRick Nash of Canada was named the tournament's most valuable player by the IIHF directorate. Aleksey Morozov of Russia led the tournament in goal scoring, and was named the top forward. Russian Andrei Markov was named top defenceman and Kari Lehtonen of Finland was selected as top goaltender. Sweden's Johan Davidsson was the tournament's leading scorer and Alexander Eremenko of Russia led goaltenders in save percentage, with 0.957."

        "text": "The combination jersey (also known as the multi-coloured jersey or technicolour jersey) was the jersey in the Tour de France worn by the leader of the combination classification.\nHistory.\nIn 1968 the combination classification was introduced in the Tour de France. From 1969 on, the leader was recognized by a white jersey. The jersey was awarded to the cyclists that did best in all other classifications: General, Points and Mountains. It was seen as the classification for the all-round cyclist.\nOnly cyclists ranking in each of the three other classifications were ranked in the Combination classification. Ranking was established by adding the cyclists' ranks in the three other classifications: 1 point for rank 1, 2 points for rank 2 and so on. Cyclists being at level on ranks for one of the other classifications were added the average of the corresponding points (e.g. 2 cyclists being level at rank 3 where counting (3+4)/2 = 3.5 points). Finally, the lower the sum the better the combination classification ranking.\nFrom 1975 on, the combination classification temporarily disappeared, and the white jersey was given to the leader of the young rider classification.\nIn 1980, the combination classification was reintroduced, sponsored by French television station TF1, therefore officially named \"Grand Prix TF1\". This lasted until 1984, when the combination classification disappeared again. In 1985, the combination classification was again reintroduced, and this time the multicoloured jersey was used. After the 1989 Tour, the combination classification was discontinued, as the new director Jean-Marie Leblanc wanted to modernise the Tour. Since then, the Tour has awarded only the yellow, white, green and polka dot jerseys."

        "title": "Tulsa Golden Hurricane men's basketball",
        "text": "The Tulsa Golden Hurricane men's basketball team represents the University of Tulsa in Tulsa, in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The team participates in the American Athletic Conference. The Golden Hurricane are led by head coach Eric Konkol, hired from Louisiana Tech on March 21, 2022, to replace Frank Haith who had resigned.\nThe team has long been successful, especially since the hiring of Nolan Richardson in 1980. Many big-name coaches previously worked at Tulsa, like University of Kansas coach Bill Self and Minnesota coach Tubby Smith. The Hurricane have been to the NCAA tournament 14 times in their history. In addition, they have won two National Invitation Tournaments, in 1981 and 2001, and one CBI tournament. In 2005, \"Street &amp; Smith's\" named the University of Tulsa as the 59th best college basketball program of all time.\nHistory.\nClarence Iba, brother of Henry Iba, helped to springboard Tulsa to success when named the head coach in 1949. He coached at the school for 11 years, the longest tenure of any Tulsa coach, and is the second all-time winningest coach at the school with 137 wins in his 11 seasons.\nNolan Richardson is credited with bringing the Tulsa program to national prominence when hired in 1980, and he led the school to the 1981 NIT Championship and had a .763 winning percentage at the school. He became the first coach in NCAA history to win 50 games in his first two seasons.\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, a succession of Tulsa coaches went on to big-name programs across the country, including Tubby Smith, Buzz Peterson, and Bill Self. The team remained successful throughout the string of coaches.\nDoug Wojcik, coach from 2005 to 2012, is the all-time winningest coach at the school with 140 wins.\nNotable assistants in the program's history have included Billy Gillispie, Flip Saunders, Kevin O’Neill, Mike Anderson, Ron Jirsa and Jerry Wainwright.\nNotable Players.\nTulsa has had a series of great players at the program, many of whom have gone on to play in the NBA. Successful players to never make it to the NBA include Gary Collier, the 1994 MVC player of the year, Michael Scott, the 1989 and 1991 MVC defensive player of the year, and Willie Biles who led the MVC in scoring in both the 1972–73 and 1973–1974 seasons.\nAmong those who did make it to the NBA, James King, who came back to coach the program after his NBA career, and Bingo Smith had the greatest success. King was selected to the 1968 NBA All-Star Game, and Smith scored more than 10,000 points in his career, having his number retired by the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nSteve Bracey (1970–72) was a member of the 1974–75 Golden State Warriors NBA Championship team.\nHistory.\nTulsa's basketball program was founded by W.R. Bergen in 1907, when the school still went by the name Kendall College. It went 1–1 in its first season. Following the 1908–09 season, the team went on hiatus for several years before restarting for the 1913–14 season under Harvey Allen. In 1917, the school played its first games outside the state of Oklahoma, but did not see great success until Francis Schmidt became head coach in 1918; Schmidt led the school to 16 consecutive victories in the 1919–20 season, the school record. The team hit hard times and achieved occasional modest success until the arrival of Clarence Iba in 1949. Of special note is the 1942–1943 winless squad under Mike Milligan, whose team went 0–10.\nUnder Iba, Tulsa reached the post-season for the first time in the 1953 NIT. (In March 1921, Tulsa had been invited to the National A.A.U. tournament after an 18–1 season which widely regarded them as Oklahoma champions). In 1955, Iba led the Golden Hurricane to their first Missouri Valley Conference title and NCAA tournament appearance. Joe Swank succeeded Iba in 1960. It was under Swank that the color barrier was broken in the Tulsa basketball program. Swank had some winning seasons, but the program would be without real success until the arrival of Nolan Richardson.\nNolan Richardson's hiring helped to usher in a new era of success at Tulsa that has remained fairly consistent since then. He led the team the NIT Championship in the 1980–1981 season, his first at the school. Richardson also won two MVC regular season and two MVC tournament championships in his five-season tenure. His flamboyant personality made him extremely popular; his teams adopted McFadden &amp; Whitehead's \"Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now\" as their theme song during the Richardson years. Richardson was succeeded by J. D. Barnett, who continued the team's success, winning one tournament and one regular season championship and finishing lower than third in the conference only once. Barnett was fired, however, due to the significant increase in expectations at Tulsa following Richardson's success.\nBarnett was succeeded by Tubby Smith, who went on to coach at Kentucky, Georgia and Minnesota. Smith spent four seasons at Tulsa, winning two MVC championships and leading them past the first round of the NCAA tournament for the first time, to the Sweet Sixteen in both the 1993–1994 and 1994–1995 seasons. A succession of high-profile coaches came through following Smith's departure for Georgia. Steve Robinson led the team to consecutive NCAA appearances before departing for Florida State. Bill Self succeeded Robinson for three seasons, winning two WAC titles in the 1998–99 and 1999–00 seasons and leading Tulsa to its best record ever, a 32–5 record in the 1999–00 season. Tulsa advanced to the Elite Eight in the 2000 NCAA tournament as a #7 seed. Self departed for Illinois and was succeeded by Buzz Peterson. Peterson led the team to the 2001 NIT Championship and promptly took the head coaching position at the University of Tennessee.\nFollowing Peterson's departure, John Phillips led the team to NCAA tournaments in his first two seasons and won a WAC title. However, he passed on local high school star Caleb Green, a decision that came back to haunt him when Green signed with ORU. Phillips resigned on Christmas Day, 2004. The team finished that season 9th in the WAC, TU's worst ever conference finish. Doug Wojcik was hired before the 2005–06 season to revive the program. He led the team to 20 wins in both his second, third, and fourth seasons and the 2008 College Basketball Invitational championship, led by tournament MVP Jerome Jordan. Wojcik's hiring also coincided with Tulsa's decision to join Conference USA.\nMuch has been made of Tulsa's ability to hire good coaching candidates but their inability to retain them like Gonzaga has been able to. Since Barnett's firing after the 1990–1991 season, only one coach has stayed at the program more than four seasons and all but one have departed for larger programs. Barnett has speculated that finances may be a reason when larger programs come calling, but he also \"[does]n't know what the real philosophical reasons are.\"\nAwards.\nCoach of the Year\nPlayer of the Year\nDefensive Player of the Year\nFreshman of the Year\nRetired numbers.\nSeven numbers have been retired by the University of Tulsa basketball program. The most recent was that of Bingo Smith on February 22, 2020.\nPost-season.\nThe Golden Hurricane have made 16 NCAA tournament appearances (12–16 combined record), 10 NIT appearances (12–8 combined record), and two CBI appearances (5–2 combined record). They are twice NIT champions, in 1981 and 2001, and were champions of the CBI in 2008.\nNCAA tournament seeding history.\nThe NCAA began seeding the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament with the 1979 edition. The 64-team field started in 1985, which guaranteed that a championship team had to win six games.\nNIT Results.\nThe Golden Hurricane have two NIT championships, in 1981 and 2001.\nCBI results.\nThe Golden Hurricane were champions of the 2008 College Basketball Invitational, which was the inaugural tournament.\nConferences.\nTulsa has been a member of a variety of conferences over its history. With Oklahoma and Oklahoma State, the Oklahoma Collegiate Conference was formed for the 1914–1915 season. Tulsa would participate in this conference for fifteen years, with occasional breaks. In 1929, the program co-founded the Big Four Conference, which lasted five seasons.\nThe University of Tulsa joined the Missouri Valley Conference in 1934. Tulsa remained a member of the MVC until 1996, when it joined the Western Athletic Conference for the 1996–1997 season. While a member of the WAC, it was at various times in both the Mountain and Pacific Division. Tulsa joined Conference USA with the 2005–2006 season. For the 2014–2015 season, the Golden Hurricane joined the American Athletic Conference.\nArenas.\nTulsa currently plays in the Reynolds Center, an 8,355-capacity on-campus arena adjacent to Skelly Field at H. A. Chapman Stadium. The Reynolds Center was completed in 1998. The student section is known as the Storm Front, and is known in the current year for members of the TU Chapter of Beta Upsilon Chi, who carry shields and wear various animal masks during opponent free throws. Efforts are made by the coaching staff through frequent e-mails to encourage attendance and creativity from the student body. Previously, the Golden Hurricane had played off-campus, using the Tulsa Convention Center from the mid 1976–77 season on. Before the Convention Center, the team played at the Expo Square Pavilion from the 1947–48 season. In the early years of the program, the team played at various area high schools and in smaller on-campus gymnasiums.\nRivals.\nTulsa's primary basketball rival is Wichita State University, but that rivalry had faded somewhat between the time Tulsa left the Missouri Valley Conference after the 1995 season and both teams having joined the American Athletic Conference by 2017, when it was renewed indefinitely by both schools. Tulsa also has a mild rivalry with Oral Roberts University, which is located in southern Tulsa. The teams began play in 1974 and has largely been one sided, however Oral Roberts has tightened the gap quite a bit in recent years, the two teams currently play annually. A traveling trophy, the Mayor's Cup, is exchanged between the winner of the game. Tulsa hired Bill Self away from Oral Roberts in 1997.\nWhile in the Missouri Valley Conference, the Golden Hurricane had an extensive rivalry with Wichita State Creighton, Southern Illinois and Bradley. The team has also had longstanding competitions against Oklahoma, Oklahoma State and Arkansas. The rivalry with Arkansas was enhanced with their hiring of Nolan Richardson away from Tulsa in 1985. Tulsa had an intense rivalry with Fresno State and Hawaii while a member of the Western Athletic Conference. Southern Methodist remains a fairly interesting rivalry, given that the two schools sometimes recruit similar players and that former Southern Methodist coach Matt Doherty was considered a front-runner for the Tulsa job prior to Doug Wojcik taking the helm; likewise, Doug Wojcik once interviewed for the Southern Methodist job. The current SMU coach, Larry Brown, was the college coach of former Tulsa coach Danny Manning who left to become the head coach at Wake Forest in 2014.\nTulsa moved into the American Athletic Conference in July 2014, restoring natural rivalries with AAC members Memphis, Cincinnati, SMU and Houston."

        "text": "Michael Robertson (born 14 April 1983) is a former Scotland international rugby league footballer. His usual position was on the but he could also play as a with equal ability. He played for the London Broncos in the Super League, and the Canberra Raiders and Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in the NRL. He was considered a player with natural pace and try scoring ability.\nBackground.\nRobertson was born in Wellington, New South Wales, Australia.\nPlaying career.\nRobertson played junior football with Valley Dragons in the ACT, and was graded to the Canberra Raiders, making his first-grade début in 2001 against the North Queensland Cowboys.\nAfter signing to play for the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles from the start of the 2006 NRL season, Robertson cemented his spot on the left win for Manly and played in the 2007 NRL grand final defeat by the Melbourne Storm.\nHe scored three tries in the Manly club's record breaking 40-0 2008 NRL Grand Final victory over Melbourne, becoming the first player to score three tries in an Australian Grand Final since Steve Renouf did so for the Brisbane Broncos in the 1997 Super League Grand Final. He would then go on to play in Manly's 28–20 win over English Super League champions the Leeds Rhinos in the 2009 World Club Challenge played at Elland Road in Leeds.\nNormally a left side winger, suspension and injuries to Brett Stewart saw Robertson play most of the 2009 NRL season at fullback for the Sea Eagles. When Stewart suffered a season ending knee injury in Round 1 of the 2010 season against the Wests Tigers, it was expected that coach Des Hasler would move Robertson to fullback for the season. However, the pre-season signing of former North Queensland Cowboys utility back Ben Farrar allowed Hasler to keep Robbo in his referred wing position and play Farrar at fullback.\nAfter débuting for the Manly club in round 2, 2006 Robertson played in 139 consecutive club games until suffering a knee injury in a two try performance against the Gold Coast Titans in round 10 of the 2011 season. The injury was expected to keep Robertson out only for a single game, but he ended up missing three games. He returned to the club in Manly's 22–18 win over Parramatta at Brookvale Oval\nTowards the end of the 2011 NRL home and away season, Robertson announced that he would be leaving Manly after six years with the club. Robertson would fulfill a long-held ambition to play in England when he would join the Super League club the London Broncos in 2012. Until then Robertson had vowed he would take his place on the wing with Manly in a bid to win his second NRL premiership with Manly-Warringah, which they achieved by taking out the 2011 NRL Grand Final over the New Zealand Warriors 24–10.\nRobertson's last play for Manly-Warringah was a goal kick after the final siren of the 2011 Grand Final converting captain Jamie Lyon's try giving the departing winger a perfect 2/2 goal kicking record in the NRL (having also kicked a goal in Manly's 42–8 win over North Queensland 3 weeks earlier in the Qualifying Final) to go along with his 83 tries from 209 first grade appearances for Canberra and Manly.\nSuper League.\nRobertson made his first appearance on the wing for the London Broncos on 14 February 2012. He scored a try on début in a 24–34 loss to St. Helens at the Stoop Stadium in London. Robertson signed a 2-year deal midway through the 2012 season. In total, Robertson made 41 appearances for London scoring 18 tries.\nRepresentative career.\nDue to his Scottish heritage, Robertson made himself available for Scotland's 2008 Rugby League World Cup campaign. Robertson was named in the Scotland squad for the World Cup and played all three of their games at , scoring a try in the team's 18–16 win over Fiji at Bluetongue Stadium in Gosford.\nRobertson's good form to start the 2010 NRL season scoring 7 tries in 8 games in his preferred position of wing was rewarded with selection for Country Origin in the annual City vs Country Origin match in Port Macquarie. Robertson, who is normally a left winger for the Sea Eagles, played on the right wing and scored a try in Country's 36–18 win over City."

He played college basketball for Syracuse before playing professionally in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, South America, New Zealand, and the NBA Development League.\nHigh school career.\nRoberts attended St. Anthony High School in Jersey City, New Jersey, where he was coached by the legendary Bob Hurley. As a freshman in 1999–2000, the Friars went 19–7 on the season. During his sophomore campaign, the team went 27–3 but Roberts missed the season with a leg injury.\nAs a junior in 2001–02, Roberts averaged 10.1 points and 8.0 rebounds for a Friars team that posted a 29–1 mark and finished ranked second in the nation.

Between December 9 and December 12, Roberts spent three days with the Oklahoma City Thunder during training camp in the lead up to the 2011–12 NBA season. He returned to the D-Fenders following this stint, but was later waived by the team on December 28 due to an injury. In 11 games for the D-Fenders, he averaged 6.9 points and 3.9 rebounds per game.\nIn December 2012, Roberts signed with Busan KT Sonicboom of the Korean Basketball League.

He played for the Chicago Black Hawks and Minnesota North Stars over an 11-year career.\nReid was born in Fort Erie, Ontario.\nPlaying career.\nNot known as a goal scorer, perhaps Reid's best known accomplishment as a player was scoring a rare penalty shot goal on October 14, 1971 against Ken Dryden of the Montreal Canadiens. It was the only penalty shot ever scored against Dryden and one of only 17 goals that Reid scored in his career. \nReid was forced to retire as an active player after the 1977–78 season due to a rash known amongst his colleagues as \"the gunk\" which covered 70 percent of his body. The rash at its worst secretes a yellowish liquid that sticks to a uniform or protective equipment worn by a player. Reid didn’t start experiencing it until his eighth season in the league and was advised by his doctors to end his career because the steroid and cortisone shots he had been taking would lead to fatal consequences. A similar skin disorder would also abbreviate the career of Marián Hossa four decades later.\nBroadcasting.\nAfter retiring as a player, Reid spent 12 years as color analyst for the North Stars. After the team's move to Dallas, Reid continued as an analyst for NCAA hockey. He and Bob Kurtz have been part of the radio broadcast team for the Minnesota Wild since the team's inaugural season in 2000."

        "text": "John Gregory (November 22, 1938 – December 12, 2022) was an American football head coach. He coached college football and at the professional level in the Canadian Football League (CFL), Arena Football League (AFL), and Indoor Football League (IFL).\nCoaching career.\nEarly years.\nGregory's first coaching job was at Iowa Central Community College, where he was assistant head coach and athletic director of the new football program. In Gregory's three years there, the program had a 24–3–1 record and won the Wool Bowl in 1969. John Matuszak, who was recruited by Gregory, went on to become the number one pick in the 1973 NFL Draft.\nHis first college head coaching job was at South Dakota State, where he had 55–50–3 record from 1972 to 1981. Gregory is third in school history in coaching victories and his 1979 team had a single season best record of 9–2. SDSU didn't have a winning record the previous 11 seasons before Gregory's arrival.\nAfter serving as Northern Iowa offensive coordinator in 1982, Gregory was the offensive line coach of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers for the six seasons. In 1984 Winnipeg won the Grey Cup in part due to Gregory's offensive line that helped set a CFL single season rushing record.\nSaskatchewan Roughriders.\nAfter the 1986 season he was hired to coach Saskatchewan Roughriders, a team that had no playoff appearances in the past 10 years. While the Saskatchewan Roughriders finished in 4th (and last) place in the CFL West Division with a 5-12-1 record in his first season at the helm of the Western Riders in 1987, the following year, he led the Riders to an 11–7 record and a playoff berth. He won the Annis Stukus Trophy as the league's coach of the year. In 1989, the Roughriders finished 9–9 and won the 77th Grey Cup, their first since 1966. After a 1–6 start in 1991, he was fired and replaced by Don Matthews. He had a 35–43–1 overall record in Saskatchewan.\nHamilton Tiger-Cats.\nThat same season, he was hired to replace David Beckman as head coach of the 0–8 Hamilton Tiger-Cats. He made the postseason two of the four years he was with the team and finished with a 24–40 record.\nArena Football.\nIn 1995, Jim Foster hired Gregory to build an Arena Football League expansion team in Des Moines, Iowa. Gregory coached the Iowa Barnstormers to five division titles in six seasons and led the team to two ArenaBowls. Quarterbacks Kurt Warner and Aaron Garcia are considered two of the greatest AFL players ever. Gregory was named AFL Coach of the Year in 1995 and 1996. The Barnstormers relocated to New York in 2001, becoming the New York Dragons; and Gregory left the team in 2003. Gregory later joined the Carolina Cobras as offensive coordinator under Ed Khayat; after a 2–4 start to the 2004 season, Khayat was fired and Gregory took over. In his first game as Carolina's interim head coach, playing the defending ArenaBowl champion Tampa Bay Storm, the Cobras scored 24 unanswered points in the third quarter to win 54–43; it was the team's first home win since 2002. However, the Cobras suffered a losing streak that dropped them to 3–7, leading to Gregory's dismissal with six games left in the season.\nIn 2005, Gregory came out of retirement to coach the Arkansas Twisters. He went 5–7 in his first season and 10–6 in the 2006 season, losing the National Conference Championship to the Spokane Shock. In 2007, the Twisters improved to a 12–4 record, a franchise best, but lost to the Bossier–Shreveport Battle Wings in the first round of the playoffs.\nIn 2007, it was announced that Gregory would return to Iowa to coach the new expansion Iowa Barnstormers.\nOn May 17, 2011, Gregory resigned from his position with the Barnstormers.\nIn 2012, Gregory was the offensive coordinator for the Tampa Bay Storm. It is his first position where he has not been a team head coach for more than two decades.\nGregory was the commissioner of the National Arena League during its first season in 2017.\nPersonal life and death.\nGregory died on December 12, 2022, at the age of 84."

        "text": "The Cal State Northridge Matadors men's basketball team is the men's college basketball program representing California State University, Northridge. The team currently competes in the Big West Conference of the NCAA's Division I. The Matadors' current head coach is Andy Newman.\nHistory.\nUntil 1972, the school and its teams were known as San Fernando Valley State College. The Matadors played their home games at local high schools until Matador Gymnasium was completed, before the start of the 1962–63 season.\nEarly years.\nSan Fernando Valley State College opened in 1958, and fielded a basketball program for the 1958–59 season. The program's first head coach was Paul Thomas.\nThe first game in SFVSC's history was a 110–45 loss to Chapman College on December 1, 1958. The fledgling team would lose again to Westmont eight days later. They broke through for the first win of the program's history on December 13, a 73–64 triumph over La Verne. They would go on to finish their inaugural season with a record of 3–13.\nThe Matadors showed some improvement over the next two seasons, and joined the CCAA in 1961. Matador Gymnasium opened on November 30, 1962, with a 69–59 defeat to Pepperdine. Two consecutive last-place finishes in the CCAA resulted in Thomas's dismissal at the end of the 1962–63 season.\nFrom 1959–62, Jim Malkin scored 1301 points for the SFVSC. He would remain the school's all-time leading scorer until 1994.\n1960–1971: The Jerry Ball era.\nThomas's replacement as head coach was Jerry Ball, who had been an assistant under Thomas. Ball showed immediate progress, taking the team to a 9–17 record in 1963–64, a six-game improvement over Thomas's final season. He would guide the Matadors to their first-ever winning season, finishing 18–8 in 1964–65. SFVSU would win their first conference championship under Ball, finishing 7–1 in the CCAA in 1970–71. Ball left the school after this season.\nBall's top player was Jerry Joseph, who played for the Matadors from 1967 to 1970. Joseph ended his collegiate career with 1204 points and 807 rebounds. He is still the all-time leading rebounder in school history.\n1971: Success under Cassidy.\nBall was replaced by Pete Cassidy, an SFVSC assistant coach who was a player during the program's first two seasons. Cassidy would pick up where Ball left off, finishing 16–9 and tied for first in the CCAA. For the next five seasons, Northridge would be mired in mediocrity. However, player Paul McCracken, a high-flying ace later played in the NBA.\nIn the 1977–78 season, things took off for the Matadors. Led by Division II All-Americans Terry Miller and Larry Singleton, and Chuck Evans the team would finish 22–7 and win the CCAA title. CSUN would make their first postseason appearance, hosting the Division II Western Regional, but losing to San Diego 70–67 in the regional final. This game set the Matadome attendance record of 3,100 fans, which has not been broken and will likely never be broken, as the gym now holds just 1,600 people. During this season, the Matadors also achieved their first national ranking, ending the regular season ranked 7th in the Division II poll.\nThe following season, Cassidy's squad notched another 20-win season and another CCAA title led by All-American Chuck Evans. Once again, they were eliminated from the NCAA Western Regional by San Diego. Over the next five years, CSUN would have four winning seasons, but not reach the postseason.\nThat changed in 1984–85, when the Matadors finished 20–10, winning the CCAA and reaching the NCAA West Regional, where they were eliminated by Cal State Hayward.\n1990: The move to Division I.\nCal State Northridge moved its athletics program, including basketball, to Division I starting with the 1990–91 season. The first season ended with a forgettable 8–20 record. In 1994, Andre Chevalier broke Malkin's 32-year-old scoring record, but it was of little help. CSUN originally independent, without a conference, before joining the fledgling American West Conference. The Matadors never won more than 11 games in any of their first six seasons in Division I.\n1996–2013: The Braswell era.\nNorthridge finally found a solid conference affiliation in 1996, joining the Big Sky Conference. Cassidy was replaced by Bobby Braswell, a Northridge alum who was previously an assistant coach at Oregon. Braswell brought with him an up-tempo, high-pressure style of play that kept the Matadors among the national leaders in steals and turnovers forced during his tenure. The turnaround was immediate, as CSUN went 14–15 and reached the Big Sky tournament championship game, falling just short of an NCAA berth in an 82–79 loss to Montana.\nBraswell took the program to even further heights, going 20–10 in the 1999–2000 season, and finally breaking through with a 22–10 season that saw the Matadors win the Big Sky regular season and tournament championships and make their first appearance in the NCAA Division I tournament. This team was led by Honorable Mention All-American Brian Heinle, who is the school's all-time scoring leader with 1641 points, and Markus Carr, who led the nation in assists that year and holds the school record with 767 for his career.\nNorthridge left the Big Sky to join the Big West Conference in 2001. CSUN reached the Big West Conference men's basketball tournament finals in 2003–04 after shocking 23rd-ranked Utah State in the semifinals. Led by Ian Boylan, who holds CSUN records for three-pointers and steals, they finished 18–13 in 2004–05. In 2008, they tied for first place in the Big West Conference. In 2009, the Matadors were selected as the pre-season favorite to win the Big West. On March 14, 2009 the Matadors beat University of Pacific in the Big West tournament championship game at the Anaheim Convention Center to make it to the 2009 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament for the second time in the school's history.\nAs Cal State Northridge celebrated its 50th anniversary, the Matador men's basketball team played well. In one of the most dramatic, high-energized games in school history, Cal State Northridge recorded a 71–66 overtime victory over Pacific in the title game of the Big West Conference tournament. Following the game, several hundred Matador fans stormed the court to congratulate the team. Rodrique Mels, who scored 23 points in the championship game against Pacific, was named tournament MVP. Mels also scored a career-high 28 points the previous night in the semifinals against UC Santa Barbara. Tremaine Townsend, who grabbed a game-high 12 rebounds against the Tigers, was also named to the all-tournament team. Coach Braswell's overall record at CSUN was 205–180, as he was relieved of his duties after the 2012-2013 season and replaced by former UNLV and NBA player, New Mexico, D-Fenders and Sacramento Kings Head Coach, Reggie Theus.\nBobby Braswell was fired as head coach on March 19, 2013. Reggie Theus was hired as head coach on April 1, 2013.\n2009 NCAA tournament.\nIn the NCAA first round game, the 15th-seeded Matadors were heavy underdogs against No. 2-seeded Memphis. As the Matadors entered the arena from the locker room, (being officially welcomed by the announcer) they were greeted with only a few cheers from their small fanbase. The Memphis Tigers came out early and took over the Matadors entrance. As the game got underway, the Matadors, playing in Kansas City, Missouri at the Sprint Center, hit a three-pointer to start the scoring. The Matadors trailed by only two points at the half. Continuing to surprise, CSUN stuck with Memphis throughout the second half as well. With approximately ten minutes left in the game, the Matadors hit a three pointer that brought the capacity crowd to its feet and gave them a five-point lead. With about three minutes left, the Tigers hit a three pointer that put them up five. As Northridge brought the ball up, the Tigers stole it and made another shot. The Matadors lost by eleven points (81–70).\n2013–2018: The Theus era.\nIn five seasons as head coach of the Matadors, Reggie Theus posted an overall record of 53–105, finishing under .500 every season at the helm. With a record of 26–54, Theus and Northridge never finished better than fifth overall in Big West Conference play during his tenure. On March 7, 2018, Theus was relieved as head coach alongside CSUN Director of Athletics Brandon Martin. During this era, the Matadors were upset by non-NAIA/NCAA program, Bethesda University to the tune of 100 - 95 under the leadership of Filipino head coach Leo Balayon\n2018–2021: Gottfried era.\nOn March 13, 2018, Former Alabama and NC State head coach Mark Gottfried was named the 6th head coach in Cal State Northridge Matadors men's basketball history.\nIn April 2021, Gottfried was placed on administrative leave due to an internal investigation into NCAA rules violations. He never returned; he and CSU Northridge mutually agreed to part ways in December 2021.\n2021-2023: Johnson era.\nTrent Johnson, former head coach at Nevada, Stanford, LSU and TCU, was named interim coach for the 2021-22 season shortly after Gottfried was placed on leave. Following the season, Johnson was formally named the seventh head coach in school history. During this era, the Matadors were once again upset by non-NAIA/NCAA program, Bethesda University, 82-80 still under the leadership of coach, Leo Balayon.\n2023-present: Newman era.\nOn April 15, 2023, former Cal State San Bernardino coach Andy Newman was named head coach for the 2023-24 season.\nOn December 19, the Matadors upset UCLA 76-72, breaking a losing streak against the Bruins that extended to 2000.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Matadors have appeared in the NCAA tournament twice, with a combined record of 0–2.\nCollege Basketball Invitational (CBI) results.\nThe Matadors have appeared in the Division I College Basketball Invitational (CBI) once. Their record is 0–1.\nNCAA Division II tournament results.\nThe Matadors have appeared in the NCAA Division II tournament three times. Their combined record is 2–4."

        "title": "Rugby league sevens",
        "text": "Rugby league sevens (or simply sevens) is a seven-a-side derivative of rugby league football, which is usually a thirteen-a-side sport. The game is substantially the same as full rugby league, with some rule changes and shorter games. Sevens is usually played in festivals, as its shorter game play allows for a tournament to be completed in a day or over a single weekend.\nAs well as being played by club sides, rugby league sevens is particularly popular with social teams, formed in the workplace or from the patrons of a public house for example, as it is often difficult in these places to form a full squad of 13 players and four substitutes of regular players. Some tournaments prefer to play rugby league nines (rugby league with nine players on each side) to distinguish it from rugby union sevens.\nHistory.\nThe game of rugby sevens dates back to its invention by Ned Haig in Melrose in the Scottish Borders in 1883, just over a decade before the schism in rugby football in 1895, which led to the creation of rugby league and rugby union. However, rugby sevens did not spread outside Scotland before the 1920s. That said, the larger part of Scotland's rugby league players have come from Borders backgrounds.\nThe record rugby league sevens attendance remains the 80,000 that attended a 1933 match between Australia and England at Roundhay Park in Leeds. This match was also attended by English royalty.\nThe first rugby \"league\" sevens tournament was played in Australia in 1961.\nThe major tournament was the World Sevens played prior to the beginning of the National Rugby League season in Sydney, Australia. That tournament has been suspended but sevens is played around the world at different levels from junior teams to international ones. Sevens is considered to be a good tool to increase the skills of players and to help emerging rugby league nations.\nPlaying area.\nSevens is played on a standard rugby league playing field as defined in Section 1 of the \"International Laws of the Game\".\nTeams.\nTeams are composed of three forwards, one half and three backs.\nRules.\nSevens follows the rules of 13-a-side rugby league with exceptions. Each rugby league nation is at liberty to adopt a modified version of international rugby league rules for their own domestic competitions; as a result the rules of rugby league sevens can vary too, even before changes implemented by competition organisers.\nMatches have two halves of seven minutes. Unlimited substitutions are allowed from a squad totalling 12 players. In sevens, smaller scrums, formed from the three forwards on each team, are formed. All kicks for goal should be drop kicks in sevens. After points have been scored a tap kick restart is taken by the non-scoring side.\nThe World Sevens, the world's premier sevens event while it operated, had two 7 minute halves up to and including the semi-finals with extra time played in the event of tie at the end normal time. The final was longer with two 10-minute halves. In 2004, the World Sevens tackle limit was reduced from 6 to 4."

Leading by 0.15 seconds at the final relay exchange, Ian Thorpe was passed by U.S. swimmer Gary Hall, Jr. at the 350 metres mark, but eventually recovered and touched the wall first with an anchor of 48.30 to deliver the Aussie foursome of Michael Klim (48.18), Chris Fydler (48.48), and Ashley Callus (48.74) a gold-medal time in 3:13.67. Leading off the race, Klim also established a global standard to shave 0.03 seconds off the record set by his Russian training partner Alexander Popov in 1994.\nPrior to the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay, Hall posted on his blog: \"My biased opinion says that we will smash them (Australia's 4x100m team) like guitars. Historically the U.S. has always risen to the occasion. But the logic in that remote area of my brain says it won't be so easy for the United States to dominate the waters this time.\" The Australian team responded to Hall's remarks after the race by playing air guitar on the pool deck. Hall recalled the race, saying, \"I don't even know how to play the guitar...I consider it the best relay race I've ever been part of. I doff my cap to the great Ian Thorpe. He had a better finish than I had.\" Another member of Australia's victorious 4x100 team, Michael Klim, recalled that \"Hall was the first swimmer to come over and congratulate us. Even though he dished it out, he was a true sportsman\".\nTeam USA's Hall (48.24), Anthony Ervin (48.89), Neil Walker (48.31), and Jason Lezak (48.42) lost a powerful challenge to the Aussies only for the silver in a new American record of 3:13.86, the second-fastest time in history, finishing 1.25 seconds under their five-year-old world record. Meanwhile, Brazil's team of Fernando Scherer (49.79), Gustavo Borges (48.61), Carlos Jayme (49.88), Edvaldo Silva Filho (49.12) earned their first ever relay medal in 20 years, as they took home the bronze with a time of 3:17.40.\nGermany (3;17.77), Italy (3:17.85), Sweden (3:19.60), and France (3:21.00) rounded out the championship field, while the Russians, led by Popov, were disqualified due to an early relay launch from Andrey Kapralov on the lead-off leg.\nIn the absence of Pieter van den Hoogenband on the morning prelims, the Dutch team posted an excellent time of 3:18.32 to lead the first heat, but was cast out of the final race for an early jumping attempt from Dennis Rijnbeek during the second exchange.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nThe following new world and Olympic records were set during this competition."

        "text": "The International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) is the international sports federation for the sliding sports of Bobsleigh and Skeleton. It was founded on 23 November 1923 by the delegates of Great Britain, France, Switzerland, Canada, and the United States at the meeting of their first International Congress in Paris, France. In June 2015, it announced a name change from FIBT to IBSF. The federation's headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland.\nThe IBSF works closely with the IOC to conduct Winter Olympics every four years. Along with the Winter Olympics, the IBSF hosts World Championships the other three years. The races are hosted on tracks in North America, Europe, and Asia. The tracks are shared with the sport of Luge, although that is managed under a different governing body, the International Luge Federation. \nHistory of Bobsleigh.\nThe world's first bobsleigh club was founded in St. Moritz, Switzerland in 1897. By 1904, competitions were taking place on natural ice courses (Olympia Bobrun St. Moritz-Celerina). This growth led to the creation of the FIBT in 1923 with inclusion into the International Olympic Committee (IOC) the following year. Before the IBSF, the organization was originally known by the French name (FIBT). At the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix, the four-man event took place. In 1930, the first FIBT World Championships took place with the four-man event in Caux-sur-Montreux, Switzerland with the first two-man event taking place in Oberhof, Germany the following year. At the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, the two-man competition debuted. In 1935, a forerunner to the International Luge Federation, was absorbed into the FIBT and a \"Section de Luge\" was created. The luge section would be abolished when the FIL was split off in 1957.\nBecause of the growing weight issue at the 1952 Winter Olympics, the first changes occurred when weight limits were introduced. Since then, configurations to the tracks and the bobsleigh itself would be regulated for both competition and safety reasons. Also, bobsleigh was not included in the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, California for cost reasons in track construction. The development of artificially refrigerated tracks in the late 1960s and early 1970s would greatly enhance speeds. World Cup competitions were first developed in the 1980s while women's competitions took place in the early 1990s. The 2-woman bobsleigh event had their first World Championships in Winterberg, Germany, in 2000 and debuted at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. In 2016 the IBSF introduced mono-bob as another discipline for youth competitions and as a women's event at the adult level.\nHistory of Skeleton.\nSkeleton was also founded in Switzerland in 1884 as part of the Cresta Run. It remained a Swiss competition until 1906 when the first competitions outside Switzerland took place in Austria. At the 1926 FIBT World Congress in Paris, it was approved that skeleton was an official Winter Olympic sport with competition taking place at the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz. 13 competitors from five nations took part. Twenty years later, skeleton reappeared on the Olympic program when the 1948 Winter Olympics returned to St. Moritz.\nAt the 1954 IOC meeting in Athens, Greece, skeleton was replaced by luge on the official Olympic program. This caused skeleton to fall into obscurity until the development of a \"bobsleigh skeleton\" which could be used on any bobsleigh track in 1970. The development of artificial tracks would also help the rebirth of skeleton as a sport.\nThe first European Championship was held in 1982 at Königsee, Germany, and the first World Championships were also staged in 1982 at St. Moritz. By 1986, the FIBT started funding skeleton and introduced training schools worldwide to grow the sport. The following year, skeleton European Championships were introduced annually. In 1989, skeleton World Championships were introduced, although the women's championships were not formed until 2000 at Igls, Austria. Skeleton was reintroduced in the Winter Olympic program when the IOC allowed competition for the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City, US.\nIBSF Competitions and Disciplines.\nThe IBSF governs competitions on all bobsleigh and skeleton events at the European Cup, North American Cup, World Cup, and Winter Olympic levels.\nMen compete in 2-man and 4-man bobsled, while women compete in 2-man and mono-bob. In each discipline there is an athlete that sits up front and controls the bobsled using the rings and ropes the steer the runners. This athlete is referred to as the Pilot or Driver. In 2-man and 4-man, any athlete other than the driver assists in the acceleration of the bobsled at the start and then does not contribute to the steering once they hop in. The rear-most athlete is referred to as the Brakeman and pulls the brakes in the bobsled once the run is complete and the sled has crossed the finish line. In mono-bob, the Driver and the Brakeman are the same person.\nIn skeleton there is just one athlete that pushes the sled before riding the sled face down through the same track as bobsleds. Similar to bobsled, there are weight minimums and also weight maximums placed on athletes. This weight is the sum of the athlete and their sled.\nIBSF Tracks.\nTracks are located in three continents; Europe, North America, and Asia. Annually, there are three different racing circuits athletes can compete on, with two of them (The North American Cup and the European Cup) being development level, while the World Cup is the top level of competition. Below is a current list of IBSF Tracks: \nPresidents.\nThe following persons have served as president of IBSF:"

        "text": "1940s.\nIn 1944, an England XI played one-day matches at Lord's against \"West Indies\" and \"Australia\", England winning both. (These were not limited overs matches.) The following year, with the Second World War having finished in the European theatre in early May, five so-called \"Victory Tests\" were arranged, against an Australian Services XI which included Keith Miller and Lindsay Hassett. England also played a Dominions team at Lord's.\nTest cricket resumed in England after the Second World War with the visit of India in 1946. England won the series 1–0 with a 10-wicket victory in the first Test at Lords in which Hardstaff scored 205* and Alec Bedser took 11 wickets on debut. Bedser took another 11 in the next test at Old Trafford. This proved to be a false dawn as England, under the aging Wally Hammond, were roundly beaten 3–0 on the 1946–1947 Ashes tour as Lindwall and Miller came to the fore. A deluge left England beaten on an unplayable Gabba pitch after Australia had scored 645. England claimed that Bradman had been caught by Ikin off Voce for 28 but the umpire did not agree and 'The Don' made 187. Hammond batted masterfully for his 32 but Miller took 7 for 60 and then Toshack 6 for 82. Australia won by an innings at Sydney with Bradman and Barnes both scoring 234. England drew at Melbourne, having been set 551 to win and again at Adelaide with Compton scoring a century in each innings, as did Morris for Australia. Australia took the final test at Sydney despite Hutton's 122 and Doug Wright's 7 for 105.\nEngland's fortunes recovered with the visit of the South Africans in 1947, a 3–0 series win restoring spirits in a high scoring rubber. Ken Cranston took four wickets in an over to complete England's victory at Headingley but the series was dominated by the batting of Denis Compton and Bill Edrich who put on 370 together at the Oval and 228 at Old Trafford. Compton scored an incredible 1,187 runs in the five tests and Edrich 869. Alan Melville scored 3 tons for South Africa and Bruce Mitchell two in the Oval test. Set 451 to win by Norman Yarley, the visitors secured the draw, and almost won, with a valiant 423 for 7.\nThe 1947–1948 tour of the West Indies was a humiliation however with an injury plagued England team beaten 2–0. Ken Cranston captained England, in the absence of the injured Gubby Allen and George Headley became the first black man to captain the West Indies. England had left Compton, Edrich, Bedser, Wright, Yardley at home and Hutton only joined them in time for the 7th match of the tour. Andy Ganteaume scored 117 in his only test innings at Port of Spain.\nWorse was to come as Bradman's 'Invincibles' swept all before them in 1948, dismissing England 4–0 and winning 25, and losing none, of their 34 tour games. England did not help themselves by dropping Len Hutton for the 3rd test. Denis Compton made a stirring 184 at Trent Bridge, withstanding the high pace of Lindwall and Miller in dreadful light. He also scored a brave 145* at Old Trafford having been hit on the forehead by a bouncer and forced to retire hurt. Sid Barnes was also hurt at short leg and taken to hospital. England were bowled out for 52 at the Oval, with the restored Hutton making 32, before Hollies famously bowled Bradman second ball in his final test innings.\nGeorge Mann captained England in his first series, just as his father had done, when England beat South Africa 2–0 in 1948–1949. England won an exciting opening contest at Durban by two wickets, thanks to Cliff Gladwin's famous scurried leg bye. Denis Compton took his only five wicket haul in tests at Cape Town while Hutton and Washbrook posted a record opening stand of 359 at Johannesburg. The consistent Jack Crapp hit 49 to win the last test just before the scheduled close.\nNew Zealand forced a draw in every test of the 1949 series in England with Martin Donnelly, who also played rugby for England, scoring 206 in the Lords Test and Bert Sutcliffe posting a ton at the Oval.\n1950s.\nThe West Indian tourists of 1950 shocked England with a 3–1 series victory. The powerful side, built around the batting of the 3 W's, who scored 20 centuries and 6,000 runs between them on tour, and spin twins Sonny Ramadhin and Alf Valentine, showed the old order of Australian and English dominance was over. Frank Worrell scored 261 at Trent Bridge and 138 at the Oval, Walcott hit 168* at Lords and Everton Weekes made a ton at Trent Bridge. 'Ram' took 26 wickets in the tests, and 135 on tour, with his right-arm mystery bowling and 11 in the historic win at Lords while Valentine's slow left arm accounted for 33 in the tests, and 123 on tour, including 8 for 104 on debut at Old Trafford.\nEngland received another thrashing at the hands of Australia on the 1950/51 tour. Hutton scored a masterful 62* in vain on a Brisbane 'sticky' – England declared at 67 – 7 and reduced Australia to 32 – 7 at one point in return – while Denis Compton had a dreadful time, averaging 7.57 in four matches. Australia won by just 28 runs at Melbourne and mystery spinner Jack Iverson took 6 for 27 at Sydney where Australia won by an innings. Len Hutton carried his bat for 156 in a losing cause in Adelaide and England's consolation victory came at Melbourne thanks to Reg Simpson's 156*. Bedser took 30 wickets and Hutton averaged 88.83 but Australia retained the Ashes 4–1. England beat New Zealand 1–0 in the two test series played on the way home. In a charming display of sportsmanship, Walter Hadlee recalled Cyril Washbrook after he was given out LBW as he had hit the ball.\nEngland beat the 1951 South Africans 3–1 in a series notable for Len Hutton's dismissal 'obstructing the field' in his 100th test innings at the Oval. Eric Rowan scored 236, at the age of 42, for South Africa at Headingley.\nEngland were beaten by India for the first time in a test match at Madras on the 1951/52 tour where Roy and Umrigar scored hundreds and Vinoo Mankad took 12 for 108. England drew the five test series 1–1.\nAfter David Sheppard captained the first two tests in his absence through injury, Len Hutton became the first professional captain of England in 1952, leading his team to a 3–0 thrashing of India, whose batsman were decidedly less confident against the pace of the debutant Fred Trueman than they had been at home. Trueman took 7 wickets at Headingley, reducing India to 0–4 at the start of their second innings and followed it up with 8 for 31 at Old Trafford. Hutton scored 150 at Lords where Godfrey Evans hit 98 before lunch.\nEngland won back the Ashes 1–0 in 1953, amid scenes of great jubilation at the Oval, where Fred Trueman played his only match in the series. Willie Watson had blocked out Australia at Lords, and Trevor Bailey everywhere else, and the pair came together in one of the great rearguard actions in England cricket scoring 109 and 71 respectively. Denis Compton's pull saw England home after Laker (4–75) and Lock (5–45) had bowled Australia out for 162 in their second innings. The side which England fielded in that match – Bailey, May, Graveney, Laker, Lock, Trueman, Edrich, Bedser, Hutton, Compton and Evans with Wardle as 12th man ranks with any England have ever put on the field of play.\nTony Lock was called for throwing, not without reason, against Barbados on England's 1953/54 tour, which ended honours even at 2 all. The 17-year-old Garry Sobers was facing at the time. More trouble followed as England lost the first two tests and there was more controversy at Georgetown when the crowd rioted after England took a wicket. Hutton, who scored 169 in the game, refused to take his team off the field and England went on to win by 9 wickets. West Indies amassed 681 at Port of Spain, with the three Ws rampant, but England secured a draw and won at Kingston thanks to Hutton's epic 205 and Bailey's 7 for 34.\nDenis Compton went on the rampage against Pakistan at Trent Bridge in 1954, making 278 before falling to 16-year-old Khalid Hasan. Nineteen-year-old, 5 foot 3 and a half inch, Hanif Mohammed, scored 1600 runs on the tour. Fazal Mahmood bowled Pakistan to a stunning 24 win at the Oval, with 6 wickets in each innings. Bedser and Bailey had been unwisely rested by England and the series was drawn 1–1.\nThe Ashes tour of 1954–1955 remains one of the most famous. Things looked bleak when Australia piled up 601 – 8 at Sydney and won by an innings with Frank Tyson taking 1 for 160 (and Fred Trueman left at home). England won a narrow victory in the second test at Sydney with Johnny Wardle swishing a vital 35 to top score in England's first innings. May and Cowdrey added 116 in the second dig to set Australia 223 and Tyson (6 for 85) and Brian Statham (3 for 45 into the breeze) bowled them out for 184. Hutton's faith in fast bowling was repaid as England went on to win the series 3–1.\nEngland bowled New Zealand out for just 26 at Auckland in March 1955 and won by an innings. Tyson took 2 for 10, Statham 3 for 9, Bob Appleyard 4 for 7 and Wardle 1 for 0. Len Hutton scored 53 at number 5 in what turned out to be his last test.\nThe score stood at 2 all in the 1955 series against South Africa before England won the fifth test by 92 runs, thanks to Peter May's 85* and Laker and Lock taking 15 wickets between them. Heine took 21 wickets in 4 tests for the tourists.\nEngland defeated Australia 2–1 under new captain Peter May in 1956. The series is forever remembered for Laker's 9 for 37 and 10 for 53 at Old Trafford, where the innings victory secured the series for his team. He took 46 wickets in the series at just 9.61.\nA tight 2 all series followed on the 1956/57 tour of South Africa. Johnny Wardle, bowling wrist spin as well as orthodox slow left arm, took 12 for 89 to win the Cape Town game where South Africa were dismissed for 72. Russell Endean became the first batsman out 'handled the ball' in Test cricket when he pushed a Jim Laker delivery away from his stumps after padding it away. Captain Peter May scored 1270 runs on the tour – and just 152 in the tests in which Hugh Tayfield took 37 wickets. Peter Richardson scored the slowest test century in 488 minutes in the first match at Johannesburg.\nEngland continued their excellent run with a crushing 3–0 win over the 1957 West Indies, each victory coming in three days. May (285*) and Cowdrey (154) put on a famous 411 at Edgbaston after Ramadhin had taken 7 for 49 in England's first innings. Peter Loader took England's first home hat trick since 1899 at Headingley. Tom Graveney scored 164 at Trent Bridge after being recalled. Tony Lock took 11 for 48 at the Oval where West Indies were spun out for 89 and 86 on an 'underprepared' pitch.\nThe 1958 New Zealanders were dispatched 4–0 but Australia finally regained the Ashes with a crushing 4–0 victory on England's ill starred 1958–1959 Ashes tour. The team had been hailed as the strongest ever to leave on an Ashes tour but Richie Benaud's revitalised Australians were too strong. Laker took 15 wickets at 21.2 but Trueman managed 9 in his three appearances and Tony Lock a mere 5 at 75 while the Australians 'bowlers' Meckiff, Rorke, Slater and Burke escaped penalty, if not scrutiny, for their questionable actions. Lindwall, 'last of the straight arm bowlers' passed Grimmet's 216 wickets in his 57th test. A 1–0 in New Zealand was scant consolation.\nEngland thrashed India once again at home in 1959, winning all five tests but were tested against the talented West Indies on the 1959–1960 tour. Sobers made 226 and Frank Worrell 197* at Bridgetown in the first test, the pair batting together for nine and a half hours in all. The second test, at Trinidad, was won by England after rioting in the wake of Charran Singh's run out. Cowdrey made 114 and 97 in Jamaica but the fast bowling of Wes Hall was fearsome in its intensity. Cowdrey took over the captaincy for the last two tests with May forced home with an abscess.\n1960s.\nThis decade was a difficult one for English cricket. The distinction between amateurs and gentlemen was abandoned in 1963 when the introduction of one day cricket in the County Game helped boost first class cricket but in the Test arena, despite England's strength on paper, Australia held the Ashes for the entire decade.\nThe controversy over throwing, which had simmered on the Ashes tour, boiled over on South Africa's tour of England in 1960, which also saw small anti apartheid demonstrations. Griffen took South Africa's first test hat trick at Lord's but was later called for throwing by umpire Frank Lee. He was called again in an exhibition match which followed the early finish of the test, and then again for not informing the umpire when he changed to bowling underarm. It was the end of his test career and he didn't play again on the tour. England won the series 3–0 and stretched their undefeated run to 16 games at the Oval when Cowdrey and Pullar put on 290 for the first wicket in the second innings to secure the draw.\nTed Dexter (180) and Raman Subba Row (112 on debut) saved England at Edgbaston against the 1961 Australians while Garth McKenzie made his test debut at Lord's and took 5 for 37 in the second innings. The emergence of the Lord's 'ridge' meant that Australia struggled against the pace of Fred Trueman to make the 69 they needed to win after Bill Lawry's first innings century had given them the advantage. Fred Trueman took 11 wickets at Headingley, including a spell of 5 for 0 bowling cutters, squaring the series for England, but Bill Lawry, who scored over 2,000 runs on his first tour of England, ground out another ton at Old Trafford and Benaud's 6 for 70 took the series 2–1. Benaud famously bowled Peter May around his legs for a duck.\nEngland lost 2–0 against India on the 1961/62 tour of the sub continent but beat Pakistan 1–0, with the newly pugnacious Bob Barber (86) and Geoff Pullar (165) posting 198 for the first wicket at Dacca. Peter Parfitt scored 3 hundreds in four tests against the Pakistan tourists in 1962 as England thrashed the tourists in each test with Cowdrey, Dexter and Graveney all scoring heavily and the fast bowlers in command.\nThe 1962–1963 Ashes tour was something of a disappointment both in terms of entertainment and result, although Colin Cowdrey passed Frank Woolley's 305* in scoring 307 against South Australia at Adelaide. Captain Ted Dexter's 99 helped England secure a draw in the first Test at Adelaide where Brian Statham overhauled Alec Bedser's test wicket taking record of 236. England won the second at Melbourne with David Shepherd scoring 113. John Murray, nursing a shoulder injury batted 100 minutes for 3 not out and Fred Titmus took 7 for 79 in the Sydney match but Australia won by 8 wickets. Don Bradman came out of retirement, at the age of 54, for the Prime Minister's XI against M.C.C. at Canberra but was bowled by Statham for just 4. Australia drew the last test at Sydney, despite Ken Barrington's 101 and 94, and retained the Ashes 1–1. England dismissed New Zealand 3–0 on the second leg of the tour, with Alan Smith and Colin Cowdrey putting on a world record stand for the 9th wicket in Wellington.\nFrank Worrell's West Indies hammered England 3–1 in 1963. An innings defeat at Old Trafford was followed by the dramatic match at Lord's when Colin Cowdrey, his arm broken by Wes Hall, returned to the non strikers end as David Allen faced the last two balls of the game with 6 needed to win. Brian Close, with a charging 70 had taken England to the brink of victory after Dexter's dashing 70 in the first innings against the fearsome pace of Hall and Charlie Griffith with Fred Trueman taking 11 for 152. Trueman took 12 for 119 at Edgbaston to give England their only win of the series but Sober's 102 at Headingley and the bowling of Gibbs and Griffith was too much for England, who also failed to defend 253 at the Oval.\nEngland's tour of India in 1963–1964 saw 5 high-scoring draws. R.G. Nadkarni bowled 131 balls without conceding a run in the Test at Madras, and headed the batting averages with 98. India scored 7 centuries to England's 4 but Fred Titmus took 27 wickets.\nThe 1964 Australians retained the Ashes once again with a 1–0 win. Wally Grout sportingly refused to run out Fred Titmus after he was accidentally knocked over by bowler Neil Hawke and left stranded at Trent Bridge, where Geoff Boycott made his debut. Rain spoiled the game, as it did at Lord's where John Edrich scored 120 in his first Ashes innings. Australia took the test, and the series, at Headingley where Burge belted 160 and Fred Titmus took 6 for 94 off 77 overs. Dexter took him off with Australian 187 for 7 and the Australians doubled their score against the new ball, going on to win by 7 wickets. Bob Simpson and Bill Lawry put on 201 for the first wicket and Simpson went on to post 311. Simpson escaped a 'close' run out decision early on. England saved the game with 256 from Ken Barrington, his 10th test century but his first at home. Most famously Fred Trueman took his 300th wicket in his 65th test, Hawke was the first to congratulate him after being caught by Colin Cowdrey.\nEngland played well in their next two series, defeating South Africa 1–0 on the 1964–1965 tour, the last they made before South Africa's isolation. England won at Durban, thanks to centuries from Barrington and Parks, and drew the other four. John Edrich scored 310* at Headingley against New Zealand in 1965, hitting a record 57 boundaries. Edrich put on 369 with Ken Barrington (163) who had been dropped after the Edgbaston test for taking 437 minutes to score 137. He failed to score in twenty overs at one point. John Snow made his debut for England who won the series 3–0. It was the first summer of 'twin tours' and South Africa proved sterner opposition, winning at Trent Bridge by 94 runs. The superb Graeme Pollock scored 125 off 145 balls and brother Peter Pollock took 10 for 87. England were frustrated by the weather at the Oval, where they made a desperate attempt to square the series. Colin Bland, a fine batsman as well as brilliant fielder, made a century and England finished on 308 for 4. It was only the second series win for South Africa in what was the last Test played between the two countries until the end of apartheid.\nThere were 7 totals over 400 in the 1965/66 Ashes, four by Australia for whom Bill Lawry was a fixture. Bob Barber made a brilliant 185 at Sydney, putting on 234 with Geoff Boycott. John Edrich scored 2 hundreds for England in the series while Bob Cowper scored 307* in 727 minutes for Australia in the final test at Melbourne. Doug Walters scored 155 and 115 in his first two matches. The 1–1 Ashes draw was followed by 3 more drawn tests in New Zealand.\nThe genius of Garry Sobers was in full bloom on the West Indies 1966 tour of England. He scored 161, 163*, 94 and 174 to set up 3 test wins and save the Lord's test against all the odds when he put on 274 with cousin David Holford after the West Indies had been reduced to 90–5. Colin Milburn scored a thrilling 94 on debut then 126 at Lords but his career was tragically curtailed by a car accident in which he lost an eye. Ken Barrington was given a thorough working over by Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith and was left out after two matches when the strain got too much. Derek Underwood was hit in the teeth by Charlie Griffith when the West Indies needed just one wicket to win. Basil Butcher scored 209 at Trent Bridge. Cowdrey was replaced by the battling Brian Close as captain at the Oval and the indefatigable Yorkshireman led his team from the front to an innings victory. Graveney (165), Ken Higgs (63) and John Snow (59*) put on 361 for England's last three wickets in their first innings.\nIndia lost all three tests in the first half of 1967 when Geoff Boycott was famously dropped for scoring too slowly in his 246* at Headingley. Pakistan were beaten 2–0, with Ken Barrington scoring a hundred in each of the three tests. Although England won the match, Pakistan played brilliantly at the Oval where Asif Iqbal made a dazzling 146.\nEngland eked out a rare series victory against the West Indies on the 1967–1968 tour, thanks to Garry Sobers' inviting declaration. Ken Barrington made 143 in the opening test at Port of Spain, his fourth in four tests, as did John Edrich, while rioting disrupted the Sabina Park match after Basil Butcher was given run out. Cowdrey was back as England captain after Brian Close had characteristically refused to apologise after a time wasting incident in a county match at Edgbaston. Fred Titmus lost 4 toes in a boating accident before the 3rd test.\nThe 1968 Ashes series was once again a 1–1 draw, with much attention paid to Australian mystery spinner Johnny Gleeson. Lawry's Australians won the first test at Old Trafford but were rolled for 78 at Lord's where Milburn scored a rollicking 83. Wintry conditions – the ground was white with hail on the first day – allowed the Australians to escape. Cowdrey scored a hundred when he became the first test player to play 100 matches. England won the Oval test after volunteers from the crowd helped clear the puddles after a storm, and Australia, 85 for 5 when the rain came at lunch, were bowled out by Derek Underwood who took 7 for 50.\nHaving scored 158 in the Oval Test, Basil D'Oliveira was controversially left out of the tour party to South Africa. Tom Cartwright withdrew with injury and South African Prime Minister John Vorster objected to D'Oliveira replacing him. M.C.C. cancelled the tour and journeyed instead to Pakistan, where trouble was never far away. Draws at Lahore and Dacca were followed by riots in Karachi where Milburn, Graveney and Knott all scored centuries. The test, and the tour, were abandoned.\nEngland ended the decade on a high, defeating both the fading West Indies and New Zealand 2–0 at home in 1969. John Hampshire scored a debut century at Lords against the West Indies but it proved a false dawn in his test career. Ray Illingworth became a surprise, but wise, choice as England captain after Colin Cowdrey suffered an achilles injury. Glenn Turner, in his original incarnation as a blocker, carried his bat for 43 in New Zealand's 131 at Lord's.\n1970s.\nThe cancellation of the proposed South Africa tour in 1970 led to the arrangement of a 5 test series against a powerful 'The Rest of the World' team. The matches were awarded Test status at the time but this was controversially revoked.\nSpearheaded by fast bowler John Snow, England regained the Ashes with two victories in Sydney under the canny captaincy of Ray Illingworth in a seven test series. A 1–0 series victory at home against Pakistan was followed by a surprise defeat against India but, after a rare winter off, the Ashes were again retained at home 2–2 in 1972. England toured India under Tony Lewis in 1972–73 and lost the series 2–1, with the Indian spin bowlers at their peak, before grinding out 3 draws in Pakistan.\nAfter defeating New Zealand 2–0 in the first test series of the summer a powerful West Indies side, featuring Garry Sobers on his last tour, defeated England 2–0. England claimed an honourable 1–1 draw in the tour of the West Indies which followed in 1973–74 and beat India in all three tests at home in 1974 before drawing three tests against a flamboyant Pakistan team in the latter half of the summer.\nThe Ashes were lost in a calamitous tour in 1974–75 under Mike Denness as England, without the self exiled Geoff Boycott, were destroyed 4–1 by the pace of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson. England reached the semi-final of the first World Cup in 1975 before losing to Australia and lost the following four test Ashes series 1–0. Another winter without a tour was followed by a heavy defeat under Tony Greig against a rampant West Indies. Clive Lloyd's men began their 15-year dominance of world cricket thanks to a battering pace attack led by Andy Roberts, Michael Holding and Wayne Daniel and the magnificent batting of Viv Richards stirred by Greig's unfortunate 'grovel' gaffe.\nEngland recovered to post a famous 3–1 win over India, thanks to their own fast bowlers, in 1976–77 and fought bravely in the Centenary Test of 1977, thanks to Derek Randall's superb 174, before losing by 45 runs, the same result as the first Test played one hundred years before. The breaking news of the Packer schism of World Series Cricket led to Grieg's removal as captain and the appointment of Mike Brearley as captain for the 1977 Ashes. A divided Australian team were defeated 3–1 in a series famous for Geoff Boycott's return and 100th century at Headingley and Ian Botham's debut.\nDraws against New Zealand and Pakistan on tour in 1977–78 were followed by the destruction of New Zealand and a Pakistan team shorn of its Packer stars in 1978. With David Gower making his debut, Ian Botham and Bob Willis at their peak with the ball and Geoff Boycott and Graham Gooch opening the batting England were a formidable outfit. A 5–1 victory against a weak Australian team in 1978–79, thanks to the determined batting of Derek Randall and a strong bowling side, was followed by a 1–0 victory at home over India and a World Cup final appearance against the West Indies. Viv Richards and Collis King thumped the English attack around Lord's before Joel Garner blew the England middle order away. With the Packer rift healed England agreed to a three test series in Australia, which they lost, but retained the Ashes as they had only agreed to the tour if they were not for stake.\n1980s.\nIan Botham took over the captaincy but was unfortunate to face the mighty West Indies side of the time in his first ten matches in charge. A fighting performance at home in 1980, in which they managed to draw 4 of the 5 tests and almost won at Trent Bridge, was followed by a crushing 'blackwash' in the West Indies in 1980/81 and, after a pair at Lord's in the first Test against Australia, in 1981, Botham lost the captaincy. Mike Brearley took over once again and a revitalised Botham tore through the Australians with bat and ball to bring exciting victories at Headingley, Edgbaston and Old Trafford. At Headingley, England won by 18 runs after following-on, only the second time in the history of England v Australia Tests that this has been achieved.\nKeith Fletcher took over and lost a desperately dull series in India 1–0 in 1981/82, thanks to turgid pitches and dreadful over rates from both teams, but thanks largely to Ian Botham won a one-off test in Sri Lanka on the way home. Bob Willis was appointed captain for the 1–0 victory over India and the 2–1 win over Pakistan in 1982 but the Ashes were lost 2–1 on the 1982/3 tour, despite a thrilling 3 run win in Melbourne.\nThe 1983 World Cup was held in England, for the third time. They lost in the semi-finals to India, who then won the final. England defeated New Zealand 3–1 in the tests which followed but struggled on the 1983/4 tour to New Zealand and Pakistan, losing both rubbers 1–0. The West Indies, at its absolute peak, destroyed England 5–0 in 1984, to no-one's great surprise, and Sri Lanka drew their lone test at the end of the summer.\nDavid Gower led England to an excellent 2–1 victory in India on the 1984/5 tour and the Australians were crushed by a powerful England batting display at home in England in 1985 with Gower, Tim Robinson and Richard Ellison among the stars. Hopes that this improvement could see a challenge mounted on the 1985/6 tour of the West Indies were dashed as England were pummelled to defeat by fearsome fast bowling. A shellshocked England went down to India 2–0 at home before beating New Zealand 1–0 but there were few hopes that the Ashes could be retained on the 1986–87 tour. Famously described by the journalist Martin Johnson as the team that 'can't bat, can't bowl and can't field' Mike Gatting's men regrouped and swept all before them and dominated the series, winning 2–1.\nA strong Pakistan team, boasting the talents of Javed Miandad, Abdul Qadir and Imran Khan beat England 1–0 home and away in 1987 and 1987/88 and a draw in the 'return' Centenary Test in Australia was followed by a 0–0 draw in three tests against a New Zealand side spearheaded by Martin Crowe and Richard Hadlee. The first World Cup to be held abroad (and also the first to be contested with 50 over games, not 60) in 1987 saw England lose to Australia by 7 runs, in a hugely exciting final.\nEngland were battered by the West Indies once again at home in 1988, although the blackwash was averted in a 4–0 defeat. A succession of England batsman were injured at the crease and a victory against Sri Lanka at the end of the summer did little to heal the bruising England had received. Unusually there was no tour that winter, with political troubles raising their ugly head and the proposed Indian trip being cancelled, but England's respite was short lived as Allan Border's Australians heralded the dawn of a new age of antipodean dominance as they trounced England 4–0 in 1989. The Ashes were not to be regained for another long 16 years. A South African rebel tour was announced even before the series ended with Graham Gooch and others being banned for their part for three years. A new look team of 'young lions' fared better than in previous tours in a 2–1 defeat in the West Indies in 1989/90.\n1990s.\nEnglish cricket went on a slide during the 1990s. This was not helped by squabbles between key players and the chairman of selectors, Raymond Illingworth. They were more often than not beaten badly during the Ashes series, as they were spellbound by Shane Warne and later Glenn McGrath. They were declared the unofficial worst side in the world after the 1999 home series loss to New Zealand.\nUnder their new captain Graham Gooch at the beginning of the decade, England missed out on a historic victory against the all-conquering West Indies cricket team, by losing their final two test matches having gone into them with a 1–0 lead. The elevation to the position of captain for Gooch led to him reaching new heights as a batsman during the summer of 1990. The new captain broke the record for most runs in a match against India at Lord's with scores of 333 and 123. New team members such as Michael Atherton, Alec Stewart and Angus Fraser aided the new captain to victories against India and New Zealand yet the team were unable to regain the Ashes during the following winter, losing 3–0.\nThe team returned during 1991 to more successful ways, by defeating Sri Lanka and New Zealand and holding the West Indies to a drawn series. Another excellent innings from Gooch against the likes of Malcolm Marshall, Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh at Headingley helped the side to their first victory against the team in England for over two decades. Although England were not the best Test match side in the world, they could lay claim to holding that position in the one-day game. The 1992 Cricket World Cup saw England performing better than everyone else, with victories over Australia, the West Indies and South Africa led them to the final against Pakistan, where a side led and inspired by Imran Khan defeated Gooch's side.\nAround this time, players such as Ian Botham, Allan Lamb and David Gower all came to the end of their international careers and specifically in the case of Botham, England had trouble replacing these players. Batsmen like Graeme Hick, Mark Ramprakash, Chris Lewis and Phil Tufnell all promised and sometimes delivered a great deal, yet the side often performed badly and disappointed its fans. Following their victory in New Zealand before the Cricket World Cup, they did not win again for another two and a half years, when the side again defeated the same opponents. During this period defeats by Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and Australia culminated in Gooch stepping down in the summer of 1993 as captain, to be replaced by his partner at the top of the order, Michael Atherton.\nThe period of captaincy under Atherton was seen as one of disaster followed by more and more disappointment for England's fans. Selectoral differences between Atherton and Raymond Illingworth often meant that players such as Angus Fraser and Devon Malcolm would not get picked, against the captain's wishes. Teams would sometimes have too many batsmen, no spin bowler and the plethora of players who would come into the side and then quickly disappear, was symptomatic of a troubled side. The demands of county cricket often meant that injuries would deny Atherton key players and when compared with Australian cricket, it was seen as antiquated by many. Performances of great excellence would often crop up, amid the rubbish. These included two centuries in a test match at Port of Spain by Alec Stewart, nine wickets in an innings from Devon Malcolm against South Africa, seven wickets on debut by Dominic Cork against the West Indies and Michael Atherton and Jack Russell batting for ten hours to salvage a draw in Johannesburg. By 1997, calls for Atherton to step down were only put off by an exciting victory at The Oval against Australia, despite losing the series 3–2. On the following tour to the West Indies, a 3–1 defeat forced the beleaguered captain to step down, to be replaced by wicketkeeper-batsman Alec Stewart.\nStewart's first test series against South Africa in the summer of 1998 resulted in the side's first success in a five match test series since their last victory against Australia in 1986/1987. Bowlers such as Dominic Cork, Angus Fraser and Darren Gough now led the bowling attack with Nasser Hussain, Graham Thorpe and Mark Ramprakash supporting Stewart and Atherton in the batting. Yet the deficiencies in the system remained and a 3–1 defeat on their next Ashes tour and a humiliating exit in the first round of the 1999 Cricket World Cup which was hosted by England led to the exit of Stewart.\nHis replacement as captain, Essex batsman Nasser Hussain, was the unfortunate holder of the captaincy during the 1999 Test series against New Zealand when a 2–1 defeat resulted in the country which gave birth to the game, being officially ranked as the worst Test-playing nation in the world.\n2000s.\nHussain's side was unable to avoid defeat in South Africa, yet his first series victory, against Zimbabwe the following summer, saw the side winning their next three test series. This included the side's first victory against the West Indies in 32 years, impressive wins in Pakistan, where Thorpe and Hussain helped see the side to victory in the dark in Karachi and a 2–1 defeat of Sri Lanka, where England displayed a new-found confidence of playing against spin bowling, a move instigated by their new coach Duncan Fletcher. However, the ultimate test for the side against Australia showed that England were still found wanting against the very best, losing 4–1.\nInjuries and retirements from the side over the next year allowed new players to come into the side. Out went Atherton, Hick, Ramprakash, Gough, Cork, Tufnell and Andrew Caddick and in came Marcus Trescothick, Michael Vaughan, Andrew Flintoff, Matthew Hoggard, Simon Jones, Stephen Harmison and Ashley Giles. Hussain looked to create a side which was harder to beat and would often rule with an uncompromising attitude. Changes which the game had long needed were made, with central contracts limiting how much county cricket the players could play and the establishment of an academy. Encouraging performances by players like Vaughan, Trescothick and Hoggard against India and Sri Lanka did give England some positive sentiments towards their chances against Australia, yet a 4–1 defeat against possibly the greatest team ever showed that they were still falling short. This and England's withdrawal from a 2003 Cricket World Cup match in Zimbabwe led to Hussain becoming disillusioned with the job.\nAfter the first Test of the 5 Test series against South Africa was drawn, Nasser Hussain resigned the Test captaincy, with Michael Vaughan being appointed in his stead. Vaughan went on to draw the series 2–2, after an Oval Test match rated by most commentators as the greatest in England since the 1981 Headingley Test. By the time of the tour in early 2004 to the West Indies, Vaughan had settled into his position as captain and was seen as an inspirational leader, who was respected by his players. This newly found confidence in the team led the side to a 3–0 victory in the Caribbean, followed by whitewashes over New Zealand and the West Indies at home, with players such as Harmison and Flintoff becoming amongst the very best in the world.\nOn 21 December 2004 England completed their eighth successive Test victory with a win in the opening Test against South Africa at Port Elizabeth, the best sequence of Test match wins by England and the team were able to complete their first away victory over their opponents since they were re-admitted to the game in 1991.\nComing into the 2005 Ashes series, England had moved up to second, having won 14 and drawn 3 of their 18 previous Test matches since March 2004, raising hopes that the series would be closely fought. The Ashes series had a long build up, with England and Australia playing a triangular ODI series with Bangladesh, with the final England-Australia match ending in a tie (not a draw), prior to a second one-day series between England and Australia won 2–1 by Australia.\nAustralia won the first Test at Lord's comfortably, but England came back to win the second Test at Edgbaston with a two-run victory, the narrowest win by runs in Ashes history. The third Test ended in a draw, with one day having been lost to rain and England one wicket away from victory. England then narrowly won the fourth Test in Nottingham by three wickets after forcing the Australians to follow on. In the fifth and final Test at the Oval in London England came into the final day needing to avoid a defeat with a lead of 40 runs and one wicket down, and batted until well after the tea interval to ensure the game would end a draw and England would regain the Ashes 2–1.\nIn the first Test series (versus Pakistan) after The Ashes triumph (in November/December 2005) England came down to earth with a bump. In the first Test match in Multan England squandered a strong position (first innings lead of 144) to eventually lose the match by 22 runs. The second Test at Faisalabad was drawn with Pakistan pressing hard for victory. In the final Test at Lahore England collapsed again to lose by an innings and 100 runs (their first innings defeat for two years).\nA test series against India followed in March 2006 with Andrew Flintoff as captain. After the first Test match was drawn due to bad light on the final day, India came back strongly to win the 2nd test but England showed true character to come back and win the third (their first Test Match win in India for 21 years) without five key players, including skipper Michael Vaughan and vice-captain Marcus Trescothick to level the three-game series. Although Trescothick returned for the three Test series against Sri Lanka in England, Flintoff retained the captaincy in the absence of Vaughan. England went on to draw the first test match despite taking a commanding lead after the first innings, England won the second test match but lost the third to tie the series 1–1.\nWith Flintoff now also absent through injury, England had yet another new captain in Andrew Strauss for the subsequent one-day series with Sri Lanka. After narrowly losing the one-off Twenty20 international, England then lost all five of the One-day Internationals, not helped by wayward bowling and further injuries. Strauss remained captain for the start of the Test series with Pakistan which followed. After the first match was drawn, Strauss was given the captaincy for the rest of the series when Flintoff was ruled out for the rest of the season, and under Strauss the side went on to win back-to-back tests at Old Trafford and Headingley and take an unassailable lead in the four-match series. The final test at The Oval ended in farce when umpires Darrell Hair and Billy Doctrove awarded five runs to England after ruling that Pakistan had tampered with the ball. Pakistan refused to leave the pavilion after tea and the umpires removed the bails, signifying that Pakistan had forfeited the match. Pakistan later took to the field, only for the umpires to stay in the pavilion. After a night of heated discussions, it was eventually agreed that the test had been correctly awarded to England, handing them a 3–0 series win.\nFlintoff was awarded the captaincy for the 2006–07 Ashes tour but shambolic England performances saw the team collapse to a 5–0 whitewash, with a late fightback to ultimately win the following Commonwealth Bank one-day series proving scant consolation. Michael Vaughan returned from injury to lead a sorry World Cup campaign with England losing to New Zealand, Sri Lanka and South Africa and crashing out in the Super 8s, despite a thrilling victory over the West Indies, thanks to Kevin Pietersen's century, in Brian Lara's last international appearance."

        "title": "Joe Delaney (snooker player)",
        "text": "Joe Delaney (born 4 August 1972 in Dublin, Ireland) is an Irish former professional snooker player.\nCareer.\nBorn in 1972, Delaney turned professional in 1991. He endured several barren seasons on the tour before losing his place in 1997, but re-qualified during the 1997/1998 season, notably reaching the last 48 stage of the 1998 World Championship. There, he beat seven opponents, including Michael Holt, Munraj Pal, Jamie Burnett and Gary Ponting, before losing 7–10 to Dave Harold.\nIn his first season back on the tour, Delaney won the majority of his matches, but progressed only to the last 96 at a ranking event – the 1998 Grand Prix, where the declining Steve James beat him 5–2.\nHaving competed for another several seasons as an amateur, Delaney reached the final of a Challenge Tour event in 2003, defeating Paul McPhillips and Joe Jogia alongside five others, before losing 3–6 to Lee Spick. This performance was not enough for him to re-qualify, but the following season heralded runs to the last 16 at another Challenge Tour event – losing 1–5 to Cypriot Mehmet Husnu – and the fifth qualifying round at the 2003 World Championship, where Gary Hardiman beat him 5–3. These results did earn Delaney a place on the main tour for the 2003/2004 season.\nThe following three seasons were without any significant progress, but Delaney enjoyed better form in 2006/2007. He reached the last 48 at the 2006 UK Championship, defeating Andrew Higginson 9–5 and fellow Irishman Fergal O'Brien 9–7 before losing to Northern Ireland's Joe Swail, also 9–7. The 2007 Welsh Open, in which Higginson would reach the final as an amateur, heralded a 5–3 victory over Spick and a 5–4 defeat of Marcus Campbell, but Delaney lost in the last 48, 0–5 to Stuart Bingham.\nEarlier in the season, he had played in the 2006 Irish Professional Championship, beating fifty-seven-year-old Alex Higgins 5–2 before losing in the quarter-finals to a resurgent Ken Doherty; the former would be Higgins's penultimate competitive match.\nAt the 2007 World Championship, Delaney defeated Ian Preece 10–7, having trailed 1–5, Barry Pinches 10–9 from 6–9 behind, and Alan McManus by the same scoreline to reach the main stages at the Crucible Theatre for the first time in his career. In his last-32 match against Matthew Stevens, Delaney came to trail 0–5, and eventually lost 2–10.\nAt the 2007 Grand Prix, Delaney progressed from his qualifying group – recording victories over Issara Kachaiwong, David Gilbert, David Gray, 4–0 over Pinches and a 4–3 defeat of Spick – but lost all five of his group matches.\nThe 2008/2009 season saw Delaney reach the last 64 in four tournaments – beating Spick 5–0 in the Northern Ireland Trophy after Spick had conceded having fallen ill, and again in the Welsh Open, 5–3, before a 1–5 defeat to Gerard Greene in the latter. At that season's World Championship, he lost 1–10 to Judd Trump.\nBy the end of the 2009/2010 season, Delaney's form had slipped, although he recorded a 10–0 whitewash over Sam Baird in qualifying for the 2010 World Championship; in his next match, he recovered from 0–8 down against Adrian Gunnell to trail only 7–9, leading the seventeenth frame by fifty-six points before Gunnell made a break of 64 to prevail 10–7.\nWith the introduction of Players Tour Championship events in 2010, Delaney played in fourteen tournaments that season, notably beating Patrick Einsle, Rory McLeod, Greene and Li Yan before exiting at the last-32 stage at the 2010 Shanghai Masters, 3–5 to Mark King.\n2010/2011 brought no more success, however, and Delaney finished his season with a 4–10 World Championship qualifying defeat to Jogia. Ranked 81st at its conclusion, he dropped off the tour once more, aged 38.\nAs an amateur, he came within one win of returning to the tour in 2012 in one of the Q-School events, but lost his quarter-final match 0–4 to Rod Lawler.\nPersonal life.\nAlongside his father and brother, Delaney runs a furniture business which makes seating for restaurants, nightclubs and cinemas."

        "title": "Swimming pool sanitation",
        "text": "Swimming pool sanitation is the process of ensuring healthy conditions in swimming pools. Proper sanitation is needed to maintain the visual clarity of water and to prevent the transmission of infectious waterborne diseases.\nMethods.\nTwo distinct and separate methods are employed in the sanitation of a swimming pool. The filtration system removes organic waste on a daily basis by using the sieve baskets inside the skimmer and circulation pump and the sand unit with a backwash facility for easy removal of organic waste from the water circulation. Disinfection - normally in the form of hypochlorous acid (HClO) - kills infectious microorganisms. Alongside these two distinct measures within the pool owner's jurisdiction, swimmer hygiene and cleanliness helps reduce organic waste build-up.\nGuidelines.\nThe World Health Organization has published international guidelines for the safety of swimming pools and similar recreational-water environments, including standards for minimizing microbial and chemical hazards. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also provides information on pool sanitation and water related illnesses for health professionals and the public. The main organizations providing certifications for pool and spa operators and technicians are the National Swimming Pool Foundation and Association of Pool &amp; Spa Professionals. The certifications are accepted by many state and local health departments.\nContaminants and disease.\nSwimming pool contaminants are introduced from environmental sources and swimmers. Affecting primarily outdoor swimming pools, environmental contaminants include windblown dirt and debris, incoming water from unsanitary sources, rain containing microscopic algae spores and droppings from birds possibly harboring disease-causing pathogens. Indoor pools are less susceptible to environmental contaminants.\nContaminants introduced by swimmers can dramatically influence the operation of indoor and outdoor swimming pools. Contaminants include micro-organisms from infected swimmers and body oils including sweat, cosmetics, suntan lotion, urine, saliva and fecal matter; for example, it was estimated by researchers that swimming pools contain, on average, 30 to 80 mL of urine for each person that uses the pool. In addition, the interaction between disinfectants and pool water contaminants can produce a mixture of chloramines and other disinfection by-products. The journal \"Environmental Science &amp; Technology\" reported that sweat and urine react with chlorine and produce trichloramine and cyanogen chloride, two chemicals dangerous to human health. Nitrosamines are another type of the disinfection by-products that are of concern as a potential health hazard.\nAcesulfame potassium is widely used in the human diet and excreted by the kidneys. It has been used by researchers as a marker to estimate the degree to which swimming pools are contaminated by urine. It was estimated that a commercial-size swimming pool of 220,000 gallons would contain about 20 gallons of urine, equivalent to about 2 gallons of urine in a typical residential pool.\nPathogenic contaminants are of greatest concern in swimming pools as they have been associated with numerous recreational water illnesses (RWIs). Public health pathogens can be present in swimming pools as viruses, bacteria, protozoa and fungi. Diarrhea is the most commonly reported illness associated with pathogenic contaminants, while other diseases associated with untreated pools are Cryptosporidiosis and Giardiasis. Other illnesses commonly occurring in poorly maintained swimming pools include otitis externa, commonly called swimmers ear, skin rashes and respiratory infections.\nMaintenance and hygiene.\nContamination can be minimized by good swimmer hygiene practices such as showering before and after swimming, and not letting children with intestinal disorders swim. Effective treatments are needed to address contaminants in pool water because preventing the introduction of pool contaminants, pathogenic and non-pathogenic, into swimming pools is, in practice, impossible.\nA well-maintained, properly operating pool filtration and re-circulation system is the first barrier, combating the contaminants large enough to be filtered. Rapid removal of these filterable contaminants reduces the impact on the disinfection system thereby limiting the formation of chloramines, restricting the formation of disinfection by-products and optimizing sanitation effectiveness. To kill pathogens and help prevent recreational water illnesses, pool operators must maintain proper levels of chlorine or another sanitizer.\nOver time, calcium from municipal water tends to accumulate, developing salt deposits in the swimming pool walls and equipment (filters, pumps), reducing their effectiveness. Therefore, it is advised to either completely drain the pool, and refill it with fresh water, or recycle the existing pool water, using reverse osmosis. The advantage of the latter method is that 90% of the water can be reused.\nPool operators must also store and handle cleaning and sanitation chemicals safely.\nPrevention of diseases in swimming pools and spas.\nDisease prevention should be the top priority for every water quality management program for pool and spa operators. Disinfection is critical to protect against pathogens, and is best managed through routine monitoring and maintenance of chemical feed equipment to ensure optimum chemical levels in accordance with state and local regulations.\nChemical parameters include disinfectant levels according to regulated pesticide label directions. pH should be kept between 7.2 and 7.8. Human tears have a pH of 7.4, making this an ideal point to set a pool. More often than not, it is improper pH and not the sanitiser that is responsible for irritating swimmers' skin and eyes.\nTotal alkalinity should be 80–120 ppm and calcium hardness between 200 and 400 ppm. \nGood hygienic behavior at swimming pools is also important for reducing health risk factors at swimming pools and spas. Showering before swimming can reduce introduction of contaminants to the pool, and showering again after swimming will help to remove any that may have been picked up by the swimmer.\nThose with diarrhea or other gastroenteritis illnesses should not swim within 2 weeks of an outbreak, especially children. Cryptosporidium is chlorine resistant.\nIn order to minimize exposure to pathogens, swimmers should avoid getting water into their mouths, and should never swallow pool or spa water.\nStandards.\nMaintaining an effective concentration of disinfectant is critically important in assuring the safety and health of swimming pool and spa users. When any of these pool chemicals are used, it is very important to keep the pH of the pool in the range 7.2 to 7.8 – according to the Langelier Saturation Index, or 7.8 to 8.2 – according to the Hamilton Index; higher pH drastically reduces the sanitizing power of the chlorine due to reduced oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), while lower pH causes bather discomfort, especially to the eyes. However, according to the Hamilton Index, a higher pH can reduce unnecessary chlorine consumption while still remaining effective at preventing algae and bacteria growth.\nTo help ensure the health of bathers and protect pool equipment, it is essential to perform routine monitoring of water quality factors (or \"parameters\") on a regular basis. This process becomes the essence of an optimum water quality management program.\nSystems and disinfection methods.\nChlorine and bromine methods.\nConventional halogen-based oxidizers such as chlorine and bromine are convenient and economical primary sanitizers for swimming pools and provide a residual level of sanitizer that remains in the water. Chlorine-releasing compounds are the most popular and frequently used in swimming pools whereas bromine-releasing compounds have found heightened popularity in spas and hot tubs. Both are members of the halogen group with demonstrated ability to destroy and deactivate a wide range of potentially dangerous bacteria and viruses in swimming pools and spas. Both exhibit three essential elements as ideal first-line-of-defense sanitizers for swimming pools and spas: they are fast-acting and enduring, they are effective algaecides, and they oxidize undesired contaminants.\nSwimming pools can be disinfected with a variety of chlorine-releasing compounds. The most basic of these compounds is molecular chlorine (Cl2); however, its application is primarily in large commercial public swimming pools. Inorganic forms of chlorine-releasing compounds frequently used in residential and public swimming pools include sodium hypochlorite commonly known as liquid bleach or simply bleach, calcium hypochlorite and lithium hypochlorite. Chlorine residuals from Cl2 and inorganic chlorine-releasing compounds break down rapidly in sunlight. To extend their disinfectant usefulness and persistence in outdoor settings, swimming pools treated with one or more of the inorganic forms of chlorine-releasing compounds can be supplemented with cyanuric acid – a granular stabilizing agent capable of extending the active chlorine residual half-life (t½) by four to sixfold.\nChlorinated isocyanurates, a family of organic chlorine-releasing compounds, are stabilized to prevent UV degradation due to the presence of cyanurate as part of their chemical backbone. These are commonly sold for general use in small summer pools, where the water is expected to be used for only a few months and is expected to be regularly topped up with fresh, due to evaporation and splash loss. It is important to change the water frequently, otherwise, levels of cyanuric acid will build up to beyond the point at which the mechanism functions. Excess cyanurates will actually work in reverse and will inhibit the chlorine. A steadily lowering pH value of the water may at first be noticed. Algal growth may become visible, even though chlorine tests show sufficient levels.\nChlorine reacting with urea in urine and other nitrogen-containing wastes from bathers can produce chloramines. Chloramines typically occur when an insufficient amount of chlorine is used to disinfect a contaminated pool. Chloramines are generally responsible for the noxious, irritating smell prominently occurring in indoor pool settings. A common way to remove chloramines is to \"superchlorinate\" (commonly called \"shocking\") the pool with a high dose of inorganic chlorine sufficient to deliver 10 ppm chlorine. Regular superchlorination (every two weeks in summer) helps to eliminate these unpleasant odors in the pool. Levels of chloramines and other volatile compounds in water can be minimized by reducing contaminants that lead to their formation (e.g., urea, creatinine, amino acids and personal care products) as well as by use of non-chlorine \"shock oxidizers\" such as potassium peroxymonosulfate.\nMedium pressure UV technology is used to control the level of chloramines in indoor pools. It is also used as a secondary form of disinfection to address chlorine-tolerant pathogens. A properly sized and maintained UV system should remove the need to shock for chloramines, although shocking would still be used to address a fecal accident in the pool. UV will not replace chlorine but is used to control the level of chloramines, which are responsible for the odor, irritation, and enhanced corrosion at an indoor pool.\nCopper ion system.\nCopper ion systems use an electric current across .500 gm bars (solid copper, or a mixture of copper and .100 gm or silver) to free copper ions into the flow of pool water to kill organisms such as algae in the water and provide a \"residual\" in the water. Alternative systems also use titanium plates to produce oxygen in the water to help degrade organic compounds.\nPrivate pool filtration.\nWater pumps.\nAn electrically operated water pump is the prime motivator in recirculating the water from the pool. Water is forced through a filter and then returned to the pool. Using a water pump by itself is often not sufficient to completely sanitize a pool. Commercial and public pool pumps usually run 24 hours a day for the entire operating season of the pool. Residential pool pumps are typically run for 4 hours per day in winter (when the pool is not in use) and up to 24 hours in summer. To save electricity costs, most pools run water pumps for between 6 hours and 12 hours in summer with the pump being controlled by an electronic timer.\nMost pool pumps available today incorporate a small filter basket as the last effort to avoid leaf or hair contamination reaching the close-tolerance impeller section of the pump.\nFiltration units.\nSand.\nA pressure-fed sand filter is typically placed in line immediately after the water pump. The filter typically contains a medium such as graded sand (called '14/24 Filter Media' in the UK system of grading the size of sand by sifting through a fine brass-wire mesh of 14 to the inch (5.5 per centimeter) to 24 to the inch (9.5 per cm)). A pressure fed sand filter is termed a 'High Rate' sand filter, and will generally filter turbid water of particulates no less than 10 micrometers in size. The rapid sand filter type are periodically 'back washed' as contaminants reduce water flow and increase back pressure. Indicated by a pressure gauge on the pressure side of the filter reaching into the 'red line' area, the pool owner is alerted to the need to 'backwash' the unit. The sand in the filter will typically last five to seven years before all the \"rough edges\" are worn off, and the more tightly packed sand no longer works as intended . Recommended filtration for public/commercial pools is 1 ton sand per 100,000 liters water (10 ounces avdp. per cubic foot of water) [7.48 US or 6.23 UK gallons].\nIntroduced in the early 1900s was another type of sand filter – the 'Rapid Sand' filter, whereby water was pumped into the top of a large volume tank (3' 0\" or more cube) (1 cubic yard/200US gal/170UK gal/770 liters) containing filter grade sand and returning to the pool through a pipe at the bottom of the tank. As there is no pressure inside this tank, they were also known as \"gravity filters\". These types of filters are not greatly effective, and are no longer common in home swimming pools, being replaced by the pressure-fed type filter.\nDiatomaceous earth.\nSome filters use diatomaceous earth to help filter out contaminants. Commonly referred to as 'D.E.' filters, they exhibit superior filtration capabilities. Often a D.E. filter will trap waterborne contaminants as small as 1 micrometer in size. D.E. filters are banned in some states, as they must be emptied out periodically and the contaminated media flushed down the sewer, causing a problem in some districts' sewage systems.\nAs of 2020, several companies now produce regenerative media filters, sometimes called precoat media filters, which use perlite as the filtration media rather than diatomaceous earth. As of 2021, perlite can safely be flushed down the sewer and is approved and NSF listed for use in the United States.\nCartridge filters.\nOther filter media that have been introduced to the residential swimming pool market since 1970 include sand particles and paper type cartridge filters of filter area arranged in a tightly packed 12\" diameter x 24\" long (300 mm x 600 mm) accordion-like circular cartridge. These units can be 'daisy-chained' together to collectively filter almost any size home pool. The cartridges are typically cleaned by removal from the filter body and hosing-off down a sewer connection. They are popular where backwashed water from a sand filter is not allowed to be discharged or go into the aquifer.\nFabric Filters\nTraditional pool filters vary in the micron particle sizes that they can capture. Fabric filters can capture particles smaller than that of standard swimming pool filtration systems. This type of filter connects where the water return to the pool after passing through a standard filter. They are usually in the form of a bag. With filtration levels as small as 1 micrometer, users can attain much cleaner water, when using a sand of cartridge filter. These levels are equal or better than that of a diatomaceous earth filter.\nAutomated pool cleaners.\nAutomated pool cleaners more commonly known as \"Automatic pool cleaners\" and in particular electric, robotic pool cleaners provide an extra measure of filtration, and in fact like the handheld vacuums can microfilter a pool, which a sand filter without flocculation or coagulants is unable to accomplish.\nThese cleaners are independent from the pool's main filter and pump system and are powered by a separate electricity source, usually in the form of a set-down transformer that is kept at least from the water in the pool, often on the pool deck. They have two internal motors: one to suck in water through a self-contained filter bag and then return the filtered water at a high speed back into the pool water, and one that is a drive motor connected to tractor-like rubber or synthetic tracks and \"brushes\" connected by rubber or plastic bands via a metal shaft. The brushes, resembling paint rollers, are located on the front and back of the machine, and help to remove contaminating particles from the pool's floor, walls, and, in some designs, even the pool steps (depending on size and configuration). They also direct the particles into the internal filter bag.\nOther systems.\nSaline chlorination units, electronic oxidation systems, ionization systems, microbe disinfection with ultra-violet lamp systems, and \"Tri-Chlor Feeders\" are other independent or auxiliary systems for swimming pool sanitation.\nConsecutive dilution.\nA consecutive dilution system is arranged to remove organic waste in stages after it passes through the skimmer. Waste matter is trapped inside one or more sequential skimmer basket sieves, each having a finer mesh to further dilute contaminant size. Dilution here is defined as the action of making something weaker in force, content, or value.\nThe first basket is placed closely after the skimmer mouth. The second is attached to the circulation pump. Here the 25% of water drawn from the main drain at the bottom of the swimming pool meets the 75% drawn from the surface. The circulation pump sieve basket is easily accessible for service and is to be emptied daily. The third sieve is the sand unit. Here smaller organic waste that has slipped through the previous sieves is trapped by sand.\nIf not removed regularly, organic waste will continue to rot down and affect water quality. The dilution process allows organic waste to be easily removed. Ultimately the sand sieve can be backwashed to remove smaller trapped organic waste which otherwise leaches ammonia and other compounds into the recirculated water. These additional solutes eventually lead to the formation of disinfection by-products (DBP's). The sieve baskets are easily removed daily for cleaning as is the sand unit, which should be back-washed at least once a week. A perfectly maintained consecutive dilution system drastically reduces the build-up of chloramines and other DBP's. The water returned to the pool should have been cleared of all organic waste above 10 microns in size.\nMineral sanitizers.\nMineral sanitizers for the swimming pool and spa use minerals, metals, or elements derived from the natural environment to produce water quality benefits that would otherwise be produced by harsh or synthetic chemicals.\nCompanies are not allowed to sell a mineral sanitizer in the United States unless it has been registered with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Currently, two mineral sanitizers are registered with the EPA: one is a silver salt with a controlled release mechanism which is applied to calcium carbonate granules that help neutralize pH; the other uses a colloidal form of silver released into water from ceramic beads.\nMineral technology takes advantage of the cleansing and filtering qualities of commonly occurring substances. Silver and copper are well-known oligodynamic substances that are effective in destroying pathogens. Silver has been shown to be effective against harmful bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi. Copper is widely used as an algicide. Alumina, derived from aluminates, filters detrimental materials at the molecular level and can be used to control the delivery rate of desirable metals such as copper. Working through the pool or spa filtration system, mineral sanitizers use combinations of these minerals to inhibit algae growth and eliminate contaminants.\nUnlike chlorine or bromine, metals and minerals do not evaporate and do not degrade. Minerals can make the water noticeably softer, and by replacing harsh chemicals in the water they lower the potential for red-eye, dry skin and foul odors.\nSkimmers.\nCoping apertures.\nWater is typically drawn from the pool via a rectangular aperture in the wall, connected through to a device fitted into one (or more) wall/s of the pool. The internals of the skimmer are accessed from the pool deck through a circular or rectangle lid, about one foot in diameter. If the pool's water pump is operational water is drawn from the pool over a floating hinged weir (operating from a vertical position to a 90-degree angle away from the pool, in order to stop leaves and debris being back-flooded into the pool by wave action), and down into a removable \"skimmer basket\", the purpose of which is to entrap leaves, dead insects and other larger floating debris.\nThe aperture visible from the pool side is typically 1' 0\" (300 mm) wide by 6\" (150 mm) high, which intersects the water midway through the center of the aperture. Skimmers with apertures wider than this are termed \"wide angle\" skimmers and may be as much as 2' 0\" wide (600 mm). Floating skimmers have the advantage of not being affected by the level of the water as these are adjusted to work with the rate of pump suction and will retain optimum skimming regardless of water level leading to a markedly reduced amount of bio-material in the water. Skimmers should always have a leaf basket or filter between it and the pump to avoid blockages in the pipes leading to the pump and filter. \nPrior to the mid 1970s most skimmers were either made of metal like copper or stainless steel either a large round or square shape. Built in concrete pour skimmers were also common on concrete pools before the introduction of PVC Skimmers in the late 1960s \nPool re-circulation.\nWater returning from the consecutive dilution system is passed through return jets below the surface. These are designed to impact a turbulent flow as the water enters the pool. This flow as a force is far less than the mass of water in the pool and takes the least pressure route upward where eventually surface tension reforms it into a laminar flow on the surface.\nAs the returned water disturbs the surface, it creates a capillary wave. If the return jets are positioned correctly, this wave creates a circular motion within the surface tension of the water, allowing that on the surface to slowly circulate around the pool walls. Organic waste floating on the surface through this circulation from the capillary wave is slowly drawn past the mouth of the skimmer where it is pulled in due to the laminar flow and surface tension over the skimmer weir. In a well-designed pool, circulation caused by the disturbed returned water aids in removing organic waste from the pool surface, directing it to be trapped inside the consecutive dilution system for easy disposal.\nMany return jets are equipped with a swivel nozzle. Used correctly, it induces deeper circulation, further cleaning the water. Turning the jet nozzles at an angle imparts rotation within the entire depth of pool water. Orientation to the left or right would generate clockwise or anti-clockwise rotation respectively. This has the benefit of cleaning the bottom of the pool and slowly moving sunken inorganic debris to the main drain where it is removed by the circulation pump basket sieve.\nIn a correctly constructed pool, rotation of the water caused by the manner it is returned from the consecutive dilution system will reduce or even waive the need to vacuum the bottom. To gain the maximum rotation force on the main body of water, the consecutive dilution system needs to be as clean and unblocked as possible to allow maximum flow pressure from the pump. As the water rotates, it also disturbs organic waste at lower water layers, forcing it to the top. Rotational force the pool return jets create is the most important part of cleaning the pool water and pushing organic waste across the mouth of the skimmer.\nWith a correctly designed and operated swimming pool, this circulation is visible and after a period of time, reaches even the deep end, inducing a low-velocity vortex above the main drain due to suction. Correct use of the return jets is the most effective way of removing disinfection by-products caused by deeper decomposing organic waste and drawing it into the consecutive dilution system for immediate disposal.\nHeaters.\nAnother piece of equipment that may be optioned in the recirculation system is a pool water heater. They can be heat pumps, natural gas or propane gas heaters, electric heaters, wood-burning heaters, or Solar hot water panel heaters – increasingly used in the sustainable design of pools.\nOther equipment.\nDiversions to electronic oxidation systems, ionization systems, microbe disinfection with ultra-violet lamp systems, and \"Tri-Chlor Feeders\" are other auxiliary systems for swimming pool sanitation - as well as solar panels - and are in most cases required to be placed after the filtration equipment, often the last items being placed before the water is returned to the pool.\nOther features.\nRecreation amenities.\nFeatures that are part of the water circulation system can extend treatment capacity needs for sizing calculations and can include: artificial streams and waterfalls, in-pool fountains, integrated hot tubs and spas, water slides and sluices, artificial \"pebble beaches\", submerged seating as bench-ledges or as \"stools\" at in-pool bars, plunge pools, and shallow children's wading pools."

He began his career with the Moose Jaw Canucks of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League, and then played with the Central Hockey League's Dallas Black Hawks. \nCareer.\nCoveted as a third line defensive forward, Long signed with the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League in 1972. Seeking a more offensive role, after two years with the team, he signed with the Edmonton Oilers of the World Hockey Association. He scored 20 goals in 1974–75 and was a second team all-star for the league. After one more solid season with Edmonton, he was traded to the Winnipeg Jets. Long was again a second team all-star in the WHA's last year before its merger with the NHL.\nIn the draft that followed the merger, Long was claimed by the Detroit Red Wings. After one year with this club, he returned to the Jets, playing one full season before suffering a career ending injury five games into the 1981–82 campaign. Upon retirement, he became a Winnipeg assistant, and during the 1983–84 season, he became head coach. In 1984–85, Long's club finished with 96 points and won a first-round playoff series, but a poor start during the next campaign led to his firing after 66 games."

He also accomplished 101 games played for Taranaki.\nCoaching career.\nEight years after his playing career ended with retirement at Taranaki, Cooper was back with Taranaki, working as an assistant coach from 1995. He went on to fulfil the same role for Taranaki in the 1997 and 1998 seasons, and was then appointed Taranaki head coach in 1999 after Jed Rowlands was appointed to succeed Graham Henry at the Auckland Blues. Cooper remained as head coach from 1999 to 2002. In 2001 he guided the New Zealand Colts side for a season and in 2002 was the assistant coach at the Crusaders. Following the dismissal of Graham Mourie as Hurricanes coach Cooper was appointed to take over the franchise and came to prominence by guiding them to the semi-finals in two of his three seasons in charge. His greatest achievement to date has been taking the side to the 2006 Final, where they were defeated by 19–12. He signed an extension to his contract in 2007, which took him through until 2009. He later stepped down as Hurricanes coach following the 2010 Super 14 season. In 2005 he was appointed to coach one of the All Blacks trial teams and the Junior All Blacks alongside Jamie Joseph.

West Indies played five Tests and won the series against England by three matches to one, with one game drawn.\nAs a result of this success, England's future home Test programme was revised so that West Indies could return in 1966, much earlier than originally planned. This was done by introducing \"twin tours\", in which two countries would each play three Tests against England in the course of a season.\nTest series.\nSecond Test.\nWhen time ran out, England were six runs short of the 234 that they needed to win. The ninth wicket fell when Derek Shackleton was run out from the fourth ball of the final over. Colin Cowdrey, who had had his left arm broken earlier in the innings and had retired hurt, reappeared with his arm in plaster; he was not required to face a ball, David Allen playing out the remaining two deliveries."

His father, Jerry Wilson, played three games in the NHL for the Montreal Canadiens in the 1950s, and later was the team doctor for the Winnipeg Jets.\nPlaying career.\nWilson is a rarity in that he played in the Canadian Hockey League, NCAA, Division I hockey in Europe, and the Canadian National Team all before playing his first game in the NHL. He started his career by playing five games for the Calgary Wranglers of the Western Hockey League in 1978–79, then moved on to play for Dartmouth College for two seasons. He was drafted 67th overall by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 1980 NHL Entry Draft. In 1982 he was a member of the first Canadian World Junior Hockey team to win a gold medal. After playing college hockey, he played two more seasons for HIFK in Finland's SM-liiga and then finally played the 1983–84 season for the Canadian National Hockey team which resulted in him playing in the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia. He scored a hat trick in a 4–2 victory of the United States in the opening game. After the Olympics he joined the Calgary Flames, having been traded in 1982 by the Blackhawks for Denis Cyr.\nWilson made an impact right away, scoring in only his second NHL shift on his first shot in his first game, against Bob Froese of the Philadelphia Flyers. He finished the season with the Flames, and the next season scored 72 points, and won the Rookie of the Month award for October 1984. Wilson was a solid contributor for the Flames until he was traded to the Hartford Whalers in the middle of the 1987–88 season. A little less than a year later, he was traded again, this time to the New York Rangers. He finished the season on a tear, scoring 55 points in the 41 games he played in 1988–89 for the Rangers. Wilson played one more season with them, before being traded back to the Whalers. He only played 45 games with the Whalers in 1990–91 before being traded back to the Flames, where he played a few more seasons before retiring in 1992–93 because of a knee injury. Wilson came out of retirement in 1996–97 to play seven games for the Manitoba Moose of the IHL, the only time he ever played in the minor leagues.\nWilson is the son of NHL player Jerry Wilson. His twin brother Geoff Wilson was also a hockey player and played for HIFK in Finland's SM-liiga (1982–83) with him.\nPersonal life.\nIn the early 1970s Wilson spent time in Sweden, where his father was a medical researcher. Wilson attended school in Sweden and played on local hockey teams with his brothers.\nWilson was a pre-med student at Dartmouth, and finished his degree in the off-seasons of his playing career. After his retirement, he founded the Carey Wilson Development Program and has his own hockey school in Winnipeg.\nHis son Colin is a former professional hockey player who played 11 seasons in the NHL with the Colorado Avalanche and the Nashville Predators. The Predators selected Colin with the seventh overall pick in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft. The BU Terriers won the national championship during Colin's sophomore season in 2009."

        "text": "The Texas Longhorns baseball team represents The University of Texas at Austin in NCAA Division I intercollegiate men's baseball competition. The Longhorns currently compete in the Big 12 Conference.\nThe University of Texas began varsity intercollegiate competition in baseball in 1894. Texas is the winningest NCAA Division I college baseball program of all time in terms of win percentage, with an all-time win–loss record of 3696–1396–32 () as of the end of the 2022 season, including a 3526–1248–28 () versus collegiate opponents. The Longhorns rank second in all-time wins, behind the Fordham Rams. Texas has won 80 regular-season conference championships and 16 conference tournament championships in baseball.\nThe Longhorns have won six NCAA baseball national championships (1949, 1950, 1975, 1983, 2002, 2005)—the third most behind LSU's total of 7 and Southern California's total of 12—and have been the runner-up in the College World Series (CWS) Championship Game or Championship Series on six other occasions (1953, 1984, 1985, 1989, 2004, 2009). Texas holds the records for most appearances in the College World Series (38), most individual CWS games won (88), most overall NCAA tournament games won (253), and most NCAA tournament appearances (62); the second-place programs in these categories have 25 CWS appearances (Miami), 74 CWS game wins (Southern California), 199 overall NCAA tournament wins (Florida State), and 58 NCAA tournament appearances (Florida State), as of the end of the 2021 season. As such, Texas is often considered to be one of the greatest programs in college baseball history. \nFormer Longhorns who have gone on to success in Major League Baseball include Roger Clemens, Calvin Schiraldi, Burt Hooton, Keith Moreland, Spike Owen, Mark Petkovsek, Greg Swindell, Brandon Belt, and Huston Street.\nFrom 1997 to 2016, the Longhorns were led by head coach Augie Garrido, who holds the record for most wins in NCAA baseball history. The team is currently led by fifth-year head coach David Pierce. Texas plays its home games at UFCU-Disch-Falk Field.\nHistory.\nThe Longhorn baseball program has been remarkably stable over the last century. Over a 105-year period (1911–2016), it had only four full-time coaches—Billy Disch (1911–1939), Bibb Falk (1940–1967), Cliff Gustafson (1968–1996), and Augie Garrido (1997–2016). David Pierce, previously head coach at Tulane University, was hired as Texas' fifth head coach on June 29, 2016.\nThe Longhorns have won national titles in 1949, 1950, 1975, 1983, 2002, and 2005.\nThe early years (1894–1910).\nThe Texas Longhorns baseball team started in 1894, with the first game in 1895. Records from the first two years are incomplete. The first collegiate victory was over Add-Ran College, what is today Texas Christian University, on April 21, 1897. Seven different managers, including some that were also the school's football coach, led the team. Four times, the team won a conference title, including one in the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association and three in the Southwestern Intercollegiate Athletic Association. The team played its home games in the first Clark Field during this time.\nWilliam J. \"Billy\" Disch era (1911–1939).\nIn 1911, Billy Disch took over the reins of the program. Disch retired following the 1939 season. During this time, he led the Longhorns to 22 conference titles, with two in the Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association and 20 in the Southwest Conference. This included a run of 10 consecutive conference titles from 1913 to 1922. Disch won 465 collegiate games during his tenure with the Longhorns. In 1928, the team moved to the second Clark Field, which was famous for its limestone cliff and goat path in left-center field.\nBibb Falk era (1940–1967).\nIn 1940, former Longhorn baseball and major league outfielder Bibb Falk became the head coach. Except for a three-year period from 1943 to 1945, during which the team was led by assistant football coach Blair Cherry, Falk coached the team until 1967. Under Falk's guidance, the Longhorns won 20 Southwest Conference titles; the Longhorns won two conference titles under Cherry. Under Falk, Texas won its first two College World Series championships (in 1949 and 1950). The Longhorns won 434 collegiate games during his tenure.\nCliff Gustafson era (1968–1996).\nFalk retired after the 1967 season and was succeeded by one of his former players, Cliff Gustafson. During his time in Austin, Gustafson led the Longhorns to 22 conference titles, 11 conference tournament championships, and College World Series championships in 1975 and 1983. Texas won 1,427 collegiate games during his tenure. In 1975, the school moved from the second Clark Field into the new Disch-Falk Field, which was named for Billy Disch and Bibb Falk.\nAugie Garrido era (1997–2016).\nAfter Cliff Gustafson retired in 1996, Augie Garrido took over the helm at Texas. During his tenure, the school won seven Big 12 Conference titles, four conference tournament championships, and two national championships, in 2002 and 2005. Augie died March 15, 2018.\nDavid Pierce era (2016–present).\nOn June 29, 2016, it was announced that David Pierce (previously head coach at Tulane and Sam Houston State) would take over being head coach at the Longhorns after the announcement of Augie Garrido's resignation.\nThrough 2018 Coach Pierce's teams have appeared in the NCAA baseball tournament in all seven years he has been a head coach (2012–2018), including 2017–2018 with the Longhorns.\nIn 2018, the Texas Longhorns won the Big 12 Championship for the first time since 2011.

        "title": "Cricket in World War II",
        "text": "Cricket in World War II was severely disrupted in most of the countries where first-class cricket is played. Only in India was a normal schedule of matches maintained throughout. In Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa and West Indies the normal first-class competitions were suspended for some or all of the war and a small number of \"ad hoc\" first-class matches were organised when possible.\nAustralia.\nAlthough Australia declared war on Germany immediately after the British declaration on 3 September 1939, there was a view prevalent in the country that favoured “business as usual” and the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) was urged by the Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, to comply with this and stage the 1939–40 Sheffield Shield competition \"for the morale of the people\". In 1940–41, however, the Sheffield Shield was not contested but ten first-class “friendly” matches were played between the States for patriotic funds; however financially these were unsuccessful.\nDuring the 1941 off-season as the war position worsened there were already proposals by the New South Wales Cricket Association to end inter-state cricket whilst the war was in progress; however at the beginning of the 1941–42 season Queensland beat New South Wales by nineteen runs in the first of seven scheduled three-day interstate matches.\nAbandonment of first-class cricket in Australia.\nThe march of the Imperial Japanese Navy and Air Force into New Guinea and the northern Australian coastline during the summer of 1941–42, however, meant that an intensification of Australia's war effort was urgently needed and first-class cricket – where matches required four or more days to complete – was incompatible with requirements to mobilise all available labour for the military. Between 9 and 11 December 1941 the state cricket associations of South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales decided at meetings with new Prime Minister John Curtin to abandon all interstate matches for the duration of the war.\nTwo weeks later, the Curtin government, along with various State governments, passed laws that entirely banned sport on weekdays, which naturally put three- or four-day cricket completely out of the question. Consequently, no first-class cricket was played in Australia in 1942–43, 1943–44 or 1944–45. The MCG was also commandeered by the services until the 1946–47 season, so that senior games in Victoria (and several first-class games in 1945–46) were held at Princes Park, Carlton. With the lifting of weekday sport bans after the Pacific War ended in 1945, first-class cricket in Australia resumed on 23 November at the Gabba between Queensland and New South Wales, though the Sheffield Shield was not awarded until 1946–47.\nWartime cricket in Australia.\nProhibitions on weekday sport did not encompass cricket on Christmas Day and New Year's Day, and consequently during the three seasons devoid of first-class cricket in Australia the main events became two-day matches on these public holidays and the nearest Saturday. These began on a limited scale in 1942–43, but were established between Services and state elevens in 1943–44. Numerous famous first-class players took part in these matches, including veteran bowling champion Grimmett and future batting star Neil Harvey. In 1944–45, after the suggestion of two-day interstate cricket at Christmas was rejected during November, these games were played again over the Christmas and New Year period with some future stars including Ray Lindwall and Colin McCool.\nEngland.\nEnd of the 1939 season.\nThe initial impact of the Second World War on English cricket was the premature conclusion of the West Indian tour in the immediate aftermath of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact which was signed on Wednesday, 23 August. England and West Indies had just concluded a three-match Test series and West Indies were next due to play Sussex at the County Cricket Ground, Hove, a three-day match starting on Saturday, 26 August. In view of the international crisis, this match and four remaining ones were cancelled and the West Indies team immediately returned home.\nThe season was almost over when war was declared on Sunday, 3 September and only ten first-class matches were cancelled. Four were due to begin on Saturday, 2 September but all were delayed due to the emergency and then cancelled after the declaration of war. Four remaining games, including Gentlemen v Players, were due to begin on different days during the following week and all were cancelled. The final matches played before the war were six County Championship games that began on Wednesday, 30 August and were completed on or before Friday, 1 September, the day the Wehrmacht invaded Poland. Three of these games were completed with a result on the second day. Two more were ended as draws by agreement on the Friday morning after news of the invasion was reported. The last match to be completed was Sussex v Yorkshire at Hove. From an overnight position of 330/3 in the first innings, chasing a Sussex score of 387, Yorkshire continued on the Friday morning and totalled 392 all out. Sussex collapsed in their second innings and were all out for only 33, whereupon Yorkshire made 30–1 to win by nine wickets. That ended the 1939 season and also marked the end of first-class cricket in England until the first of the Victory Tests began on 19 May 1945.\nThe few remaining county matches were cancelled immediately and Derek Birley commented that there was \"none of the unfortunate disposition to linger over it as in 1914\". Cricket in 1939 accepted the inevitable, summarised in the September 1939 issue of \"The Cricketer\" by Sir Home Gordon who found a suitable metaphor: \"England has now begun the grim Test match against Germany\".\nThe Third Test against West Indies was the last match played at The Oval in 1939. Soon after war was declared, the ground was requisitioned and modified for use as a prisoner-of-war camp, but no prisoners were ever held there. Lord's Cricket Ground was prepared for a similar fate but the authorities decided against it and Lord's was able to stage many games throughout the war to raise money for charity. H. S. Altham wrote in 1940 about a visit to Lord's in December 1939 as \"a sobering experience; there were sandbags everywhere and the Long Room was stripped bare with its treasures safely stored below ground\". Having painted a bleak picture thus far, Altham ended on a note of defiance: \"but the turf was a wondrous green, Old Father Time on the Grand Stand roof was gazing serenely at the nearest (barrage) balloon and one felt that somehow it would take more than totalitarian war to put an end to cricket\".\nIn the 1940 edition of \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", author R. C. Robertson-Glasgow reviewed the 1939 season and remarked that it was \"like peeping through the wrong end of a telescope at a very small but happy world\".\nCancellation of the 1939–40 England tour of India.\nAlthough German intentions were clear throughout the summer of 1939, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) selectors went ahead with choosing a team of available players for the scheduled tour of India in the autumn and winter of 1939–40. The tour was cancelled as soon as war broke out and many of the chosen players lost their only chance of representing England in Test cricket. The team would have been managed by Claude Rubie and captained by Jack Holmes of Sussex.\nClaude Rubie was an Indian Army major who had seen long service in India and had played for the Europeans in the Bombay Quadrangular between 1919 and 1926. He had then taken part in the MCC tour of India in 1926–27 before returning to England and representing Sussex in four matches in 1930. Caple gave the view that Rubie had a \"vast and profound knowledge of Indian cricket\". However, Rubie died on 3 November 1939.\nJack Holmes played for Sussex from 1922 to 1939, assuming the captaincy in 1936. He was nominally still club captain when the war ended in 1945, although he had decided to retire by then. He was a flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force (RAF) and had played in first-class matches for the Royal Air Force cricket team between 1930 and 1932. Caple commented on his nickname \"Sherlock\" and his major contribution to Sussex during his captaincy.\nSquad details below state the player's age on 1 September 1939, his batting hand, his type of bowling, and his County Championship club at the time:\nWartime charity and inter-services cricket.\nWith The Oval and many other venues unusable during the war, Lord's Cricket Ground acquired a special status and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) took on great responsibility to set up a meaningful programme of matches each season and so, as Pelham Warner put it, \"(enable) cricket to provide a healthy and restful antidote to war strain\". Warner played a major role in organising cricket during the war as, with other MCC staff joining the services, he took on the Secretary's duties under the title of \"Deputy Assistant Secretary\". His first priority was to work with the Royal Air Force (RAF) who occupied most of the Lord's estate including the practice ground and all buildings. The playing area was unaffected and the pavilion and the stands were always available for cricket; Warner paid tribute to the RAF authorities for their considerable help in enabling him to organise matches. Numerous \"ad hoc\" clubs and teams were formed, mostly based on the services. Until 1945, the majority of matches were one-day only, owing to time constraints imposed by the needs of the services, with a single innings each, but they were not limited overs and so the result could be a draw.\nThe two best-known wartime teams were the British Empire XI, Warner's own concept; and the London Counties XI which was founded by the politician Desmond Donnelly, then in the RAF. Despite its name, the British Empire XI featured mainly English county players, although West Indian Test player Bertie Clarke was its mainstay. These teams were first established in 1940 and played one-day charity matches, mostly in the south-east and often at Lord's. Although the teams were successful in raising money for charity, their main purpose was to help sustain morale.\nThere never was any real hope of staging a County Championship, even on a limited basis, although Lancashire did propose a regionalised competition to include the minor counties. The idea was that home-based servicemen and those in reserved occupations would play when time allowed, but it was not realistic and MCC declined to take it forward. This was in early 1940, during the so-called \"Phoney War\" but Lancashire's Old Trafford was subsequently bombed and the club effectively closed for the duration, directing all members' subscriptions into a war relief fund. Other county clubs closed at the outset and appealed to the members to keep paying their subscriptions as a future investment. This policy had varying success with Yorkshire declaring an increased surplus and Worcestershire, for example, only a slight improvement while Leicestershire needed funds granted by Sir Julien Cahn to keep going.\nOne of the main risks in staging matches was bombing and Lord's was hit by bombs in 1941, as reported in the 1942 \"Wisden\", but fortunately without casualties and the damage was not serious. The best known instance of bombing at Lord's occurred during a July 1944 match between the Army and the RAF, which was temporarily interrupted when a V-1 flying bomb landed nearby. The players threw themselves to the ground and then carried on playing after the explosion. On resumption, Jack Robertson defiantly hit the next delivery for six. \"Wisden\" in 1945 had two photographs of the incident under the caption \"Flying bomb stops play\".\nVictory Tests.\nThe Australian and New Zealand Services teams played in England in 1945, including a series of \"Victory Tests\" between England and Australia.\nIndia.\nAlone among the Test cricket nations, India managed to stage an almost normal schedule of first-class matches. The Ranji Trophy was contested in every season through the war and the Bombay Pentangular in all except the 1942–43 season.\nThe scheduled 1939–40 tour of India by England was cancelled but many British servicemen were stationed in India during the war and took part at times in Indian domestic cricket, including the likes of Denis Compton, Joe Hardstaff junior and Reg Simpson.\nNew Zealand.\nNew Zealand declared war on Germany in the aftermath of the British declaration and, as in Australia, initially decided on a policy of \"business as usual\" to uphold public morale. This included continuation of the Plunket Shield in the 1939–40 season but it was cancelled for the duration before the 1940–41 season. Inter-service matches were staged during the war when possible and some of these had first-class status. Towards the end of the war, an increasing number of inter-provincial matches were held ahead of the Plunket Shield being restored in 1945–46.\nSouth Africa.\nThe Currie Cup was cancelled for the duration of the war and only a limited number of first-class matches were organised.\nWest Indies.\nThe West Indian team that toured England in 1939 left the country in late August when it became clear that the outbreak of war was imminent. On Tuesday, 22 August, they had just drawn against England at The Oval to complete the third of a three-match Test series. Their next scheduled match, against Sussex at Hove was due to commence on Saturday, 26 August, but was cancelled along with four remaining matches due to be played up to Tuesday, 12 September.\nThe domestic Inter-Colonial Tournament was cancelled before the 1939–40 season and was in fact never revived after the war, although the first-class teams continued to play each other when possible. It was not until the launch of the Shell Shield in 1965–66 that a formal domestic competition was again held in the West Indies. During World War II, a small number of first-class matches were organised each season on an \"ad hoc\" basis.\nRest of the World.\nA limited amount of cricket was played in other countries. For example, a match in Canada between teams representing Montreal and Ottawa was held in September 1943.\nCricketers on active service.\nHedley Verity, Ken Farnes and others were killed during the war.\nDenis Compton, Joe Hardstaff junior and Reg Simpson were stationed in India during the war and took part in domestic cricket there. Keith Miller and Bill Edrich were pilots based in England. Bill Bowes was a prisoner-of-war from 1942 to 1945."

        "text": "Water Polo Australia (WPA) is the national governing body for Water Polo in Australia, headquartered in Sydney. WPA in its current form was formed in 1982, when it broke away from the Amateur Swimming Union of Australia (now Swimming Australia) to become the Australian Amateur Water Polo Association (AAWPA). Prior to that time, water polo was administered by a sub-committee of the ASUA. In January 1990 the AAWPA changed its name to 'Water Polo Australia Incorporated'. \nWater Polo Australia oversees the men's, women's, and youth national teams in Australia, the national coaching programs, and the seven state governing bodies of the sport. It also conducts the Australian Water Polo League, the country's premier national Water Polo competition, and holds annual national junior club and interstate representative championships.\nWPA is governed by a national conference of representatives from all states and territories, which elect six Directors to the WPA Board. Water polo is one of a small number of truly national sports in Australia, with the game being played by both men and women across every state.\nHistory.\nBehind Great Britain, Australia was the second nation in the world to play the game of water polo. The first known Australian match occurred at St. Kilda Baths, Melbourne on 3 March 1879 and was demonstrated by Professor Fred Cavill, who had only just emigrated from England. Australian men's teams have competed at every Olympic Games Water Polo Tournament since 1948, excepting 1968 (controversially not nominated by the AOC) and 1996 (did not qualify). Australia's women's team, the Aussie Stingers, were the inaugural Olympic gold medallists at the first Women's Olympic Games Water Polo Tournament in Sydney (2000), and have since won two Olympic bronze medals at Beijing (2008) and London (2012).\nThe first history of the sport in Australia was launched in February 2009, under the title 'Water Warriors: Chronicle of Australian Water Polo', by Dr. Tracy Rockwell. The 592-page publication features over 1,300 images and is an in-depth reference on water polo in Australia from its first match in 1879 to the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. An updated edition is being planned.\nAdministration.\nWater Polo in Australia uses a federated model of national, states and territory governing bodies. A number of local associations and regional zones exist within the states and territories to support the sport's growth and development throughout Australia. Alongside WPA, seven state and territory bodies oversee the conduct of their relevant local and state level competition. They are:\nCompetitions.\nWater Polo Australia organises and oversees a number of competitions, with state-based competitions organised by the respective state governing authorities."

        "text": "Extreme Baseball, also known as Double Diamond Baseball, is a sport based on traditional baseball. The main difference is that both teams are on the field at the same time. Pitchers from each team take turns pitching to batters at two adjacent home plates. One team runs around the bases in the normal counterclockwise direction, while the other team runs around bases in a clockwise direction. The world premier game took place on May 5, 2007 at Historic Sanford Memorial Stadium in Sanford, Florida.\nExtreme Baseball was conceived and developed by Phillip Weidner. In 2006, Weidner applied for a United States patent on the extreme baseball concept and the patent was approved in February, 2010.\nExtreme Baseball teams from Saint Petersburg, Florida, Orlando, Florida, and Miami, Florida were competing as of 2007 in the National Xtreme Baseball League. The league ceased operations sometime during or after 2011; the league's website includes schedules up to 2011, but as of 2021 the website's front page features the statement, \"The league is currently for sale and has ceased operations until a new owner is obtained.\""

        "text": "The 1933 Ice Hockey World Championships were held between February 18 and February 26, 1933, in Prague, Czechoslovakia.\nBy winning its first-ever world championship, the United States deprived Canada of the world title for the first time in tournament history. The American team, the Massachusetts Rangers, was mostly made up of university students and led by standout performances of Gerry Cosby in goal and team captain Ben Langmaid on defence. Canada was represented by the Toronto National Sea Fleas, winners of the 1932 Allan Cup, and coached by the controversial hockey personality Harold Ballard. The teams met on February 26 at Zimní stadión on Štvanice island. Tied 1-1 after 45 minutes of regulation time on goals by Sherman Forbes for the United States and an equalizer by Canadian Tim Kerr, defenceman John Garrison beat Canadian goalie Ron Geddes at the 6-minute mark of a dramatic \"non-sudden death\" overtime period.\nTen nations played in three groups, with the top two in each group advancing to the second round to join Canada and the United States, who both were automatically qualified through to the next round. In the second round, eight teams played in two groups; the top two teams from each group advancing to the semifinals, where the top qualifier in each group were seeded against the second qualifier in the opposing group. The winners of the semifinal matches played in the gold medal game, while the losers played for third place.\nFifth and sixth places were decided by a match between the third-place finishers in the two second ground groups; similarly seventh and eighth places were decided between the two last-place finishers in the second round groups. For the final four places, two classification matches were played between the bottom four finishers in the first round, which provided the seedings for the ninth and eleventh-place matches.\nLegacy.\nThe United States' oldest active college hockey award, the Walter Brown Award, was created in 1953 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of this championship team and its coach, the eponymous Walter A. Brown.&lt;br&gt;\nA team photograph, and a gold medal on loan from the family of Sherman Forbes, are currently on display at The Sports Museum in Boston, Massachusetts."

In December 1982, the Minnesota Twins took Gibson in the Rule 5 draft, but granted him free agency in 1984, whereupon the Tigers reacquired him.\nGibson made his major league debut on April 8, 1988, in a game against the Kansas City Royals. After the season he was honored as Tigers Rookie of the Year. In January 1992, the Tigers traded Gibson and minor leaguer Randy Marshall to the New York Mets for Mark Carreon and Tony Castillo. The Mets released Gibson in mid-1993, and he was signed by the New York Yankees. In 1994, the Yankees sent Gibson to the Milwaukee Brewers, who granted him free agency at the end of the season. The Toronto Blue Jays signed Gibson in April 1995, but released him in June. In July, the Pittsburgh Pirates signed Gibson but granted him free agency in October.

He was inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame on Long Island in the Baseball Category with the Class of 1994.\nScouting career.\nGibson is regarded as a projector scout, which envisions what a player will be able to do in a two- or three-year term. Despite the fact that Gibson had a successful pitching career, he has been able to analyze players' ability regardless their position. Gibson's style of scouting also looks for particular traits in a player's personality and character to ensure that they can handle pressure and be team leaders.\nBeginning in 2006, Gibson served as an area scout supervisor for the Atlanta Braves. During his tenure with the Braves, he was in charge of all scouting aspects of amateur players in the Northeast.\nIn 2008, the Seattle Mariners' Director of Amateur Scouting, Tom McNamara, named Gibson as the Eastern Cross-Checker Scout for the organization. Gibson was part of a bigger plan in which he was expected to work closely with the Mariners baseball operations department and scouting staff in evaluating talent for the amateur draft.\nIn 2010, Gibson joined the Kansas City Royals scouting office as the National Scouting Supervisor.\nUnder Gibson’s supervision, the Royals signed Bubba Starling, Kyle Zimmer, Cameron Gallagher, and Alfredo Escalera–Maldonado, at 17, the youngest player ever drafted by any MLB organization since the insertion of the First-Year Player Draft.\nBaseball instructor career.\nIn 1995, Gibson opened a baseball training facility in Bellport, New York, with the intention to provide proper baseball instruction to young kids in the community in which he grew up. A year later, Gibson inaugurated a 10,000 square foot indoor facility that housed batting cages and small lesson areas for local instructors during the winter.\nInfamous error card.\nGibson's 1989 Score baseball card initially featured an \"error\" and was reprinted in a \"corrected\" form. On the card, Gibson is showing preparing to deliver the pitch as an infielder stands by second base. The first version shows the infielder grabbing his crotch. After the oddity was noticed by collectors, the card became briefly popular, especially after Score reissued the card with the infielder's arm airbrushed out.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"
