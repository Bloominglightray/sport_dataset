        "title": "Volleyball variations",
        "text": "Several sports related to volleyball have become popular. Indoor volleyball and beach volleyball are both events at the Olympics, and sitting volleyball is an event at the Paralympics. Other varieties are localized, or are played at an amateur or informal level.\nAquatic volleyball.\nBiribol was the first aquatic variant of volleyball. It was invented in the '60s in Birigui, Brazil, and has moderate popularity in the country.\nAquatic volleyball is a team sport similar to volleyball but adapted for competition in a deep swimming pool. It is also referred to as \"pool volleyball\", and sometimes as \"aqua polo\", not to be confused with water polo. Players must change sides after each round for it to be fair. Each round is up to 15 points, however, you need to win by two points. If the ball hits the edge of the pool but bounces back in, that is fair. If the ball hits the edge of the pool and bounces out, that is not fair.\nBeach aquatic volleyball.\nBeach aquatic volleyball is an individual or team sport similar to aquatic volleyball adapted for play in the shallow water of a beach.\nBeach volleyball.\nA variation of the game rivaling the original sport of volleyball in popularity, beach volleyball evolved from the recreational games of volleyball played on many beaches around the world. It became an official Olympic sport in 1996. This version, rather than being played on indoor hard courts, is played on sand courts which may either be formed naturally or built specifically for the purpose. Instead of a team of six, each team consists of only two players. There are some instances where more than 2 can play together. The rules are almost identical with some exceptions including:\nFootvolley.\nFootvolley combines beach volleyball and soccer skills. The difference is that the players may not contact the ball with their hands or arms; instead they can use all other body parts including their feet, head and chest, etc. The sport originated in Brazil, but is quickly becoming popular in the US, Europe, and Asia.\nIndoor sand volleyball.\nThis is a newer variation of beach volleyball. As beach volleyball took volleyball outdoors, indoor sand volleyball takes beach volleyball indoors. In the United States, a growing number of colleges are now considering switching from hard court indoor volleyball to sand court indoor volleyball. The biggest reason for the possible change is the reduced rate of injury of players. Secondary reasons are: 1) bad weather doesn't cancel play, something that commonly happens with beach volleyball; 2) it is thought to make the game more appealing to spectators since sand courts do not require players to wear knee pads or shoes.\nIndoor sand volleyball teams vary from two to six members, college teams having six. Normally, rather than using a purpose-built hall, an indoor basketball court is converted. A protective tarpaulin covers the floor of the basketball court and \"soft\" sand is laid a foot deep over it. The boundaries are commonly marked off with lines in the sand. However, a recent innovation uses colored lasers that illuminate the lines in the sand.\nIn some venues, there exist sand courts that are used as usual during the spring, summer, and fall months, but during the winter months, a large tent (usually dome-shaped) is erected over the courts.\nSnow volleyball.\nSnow volleyball is a variant of beach volleyball that is played on snow. The rules are similar to the beach game, with the main differences being the scoring system (best of 3 sets played to 15 points) and the number of players (three starters and one substitute).\nBossaball.\nBossaball is a mix of volleyball, football (soccer), gymnastics and capoeira. The court is a combination of inflatables and trampolines, divided by a net. The headquarters of the sport is in Spain.\nCrossnet.\nHybrid sport of volleyball and four square. Can be played with 4 players or 8 players (2v2v2v2). \nEcua-volley.\nEcua-volley is a variant of volleyball invented and played in Ecuador. Differences include a higher net (2.8 meters tall) and the use of a soccer ball. It is very popular among people that live in the USA. Each court side measures 9x9 meters. There are 3 players on each side known as the spiker, the setter, and the flyer (libero). Since the ball is heavier than an American volleyball, players are allowed to slightly grab the ball however, the grab must be quick (less than 1 second). Matches are typically played up to 15, 12, or 10 points depending on what is agreed upon. No player is allowed to touch the net, the poles or pass the dividing line separating the two opposite court sides. Upon doing so is considered a point or change serve for the opposing team. Points are made on a serve only manner (meaning only the side that serves the ball can make a point, otherwise it is a change serve for the opposing team). Other rules apply as well but the rest of the game is played as your typical American volleyball.\nFistball.\nFistball (written in German as \"Faustball\") has many similarities with volleyball and was known in Central Europe at least from the 16th century, thus of different origin. The game came to the United States in 1911 with Christopher Carlton. It is often played in five player teams, outdoor on a grass field . One bounce is allowed between each hit.\nFootbag net.\nFootbag net is similar to Sepak Takraw and footvolley. It is played with feet instead of hands. Footbag net combines elements of tennis, badminton, and volleyball. Specifically, the court dimensions and layout are similar to those of badminton; the scoring is similar to the old scoring system in volleyball (you must be serving to score); and serves must be diagonal, as in tennis. It is played one on one or in teams of two. Footbag net games can be played to eleven or fifteen points, although the winners must win by at least two points.\nHooverball.\nPopularized by President Herbert Hoover, Hooverball is played with a volleyball net and a medicine ball; it is scored like tennis, but the ball is caught and then thrown back. The weight of the medicine ball can make the sport to be quite physically demanding; annual championship tournaments are held annually in West Branch, Iowa.\nInformal variations.\nThere are a number of volleyball variations that do not have a standardized set of rules. Mud volleyball, played in mud pits, is one. Mud volleyball tournaments are often organized as fundraisers.\nJollyball.\nJollyball is a cross between juggling and volleyball. A juggling ball is passed between players who must catch it by using the ball, plus the two that they are holding, to perform a juggling pattern.\nMixed teams.\nMost competitive volleyball is played with same-sex teams (exclusively so at the elite levels, although the International Volleyball Association ran a professional co-ed league in the 1970s). Different sets of rules have been drafted to allow for mixed teams, often known as \"coed\" teams in the United States. The net is at men's height for \"regular coed\" and women's height for \"reverse coed\". Several adaptations are common, some of them to compensate for the men's greater reach and strength. The FIVB rules used internationally do not support mixed play, but USA Volleyball, the national governing body for the United States, has specific rules, the main points of which are:\nNative Ball/Nadan Panthu Kali.\nOriginated and popular in Kerala, India.\nNewcomb ball.\nA simplified form used to teach the fundamentals of volleyball, Newcomb (occasionally referred to as \"Nuke 'em\") is generally taught to school-aged children but is also popular among adults of limited athletic ability. Its main differences from regular volleyball are that the ball can be caught before passing on to a team-mate or over the net, and each pass or serve is a throw rather than a hit. While most other volleyball rules apply, variations on the numbers of players per team and the numbers of 'catches' per side are common, and players holding the ball are sometimes allowed a limited number of steps.\nNewcomb (or Newcomb Ball) was invented in 1895 by Clara Gregory Baer, a physical education instructor at Newcomb College in Louisiana.\nVolleyball was independently invented in the same year. Newcomb was a popular competitive sport in the early 1900s, but it is now seen as a variation of volleyball and is played mostly by school children.\nNewcomb can be also played in a way similar to dodgeball. The main and only difference in the less played version is that instead of scoring points, a teammate is eliminated if he or she makes a mistake. The game continues until all of the players on one team are eliminated.\nNine-man volleyball.\nNine-man volleyball is a variation of volleyball utilizing nine players and a slightly larger court () originated in Asia in the 1920s when American missionaries introduced the game in China. The birthplace of 9man can be speculated to be the city of Tai-Shan, China where 9man tournaments are played regularly, sometimes even for prize money. 9man is also played for recreation in South Korea.\nThe variant became popular within the Chinese-American communities community in New York City and spread to Chinatowns other large US and Canadian cities. The North American version of 9man volleyball continues to grow with a rotating popular tournament called the North American Chinese Invitational Volleyball Tournament. It was played in the Asian Games in 1958 and in 1962.\nAside from the larger court and additional players, rule differences for 9man volleyball in Asia and of those used in the NACIVT differ.\nThe major rule differences from indoor volleyball and NACIVT 9man rules include (Those rules in italics only apply within NACIVT rules):\n9man rules used in Asia are slightly different:\nIn South Korea, nine-man volleyball is popular as a recreation. But those who plays it are not used to the detailed rule of the game because they generally watch only 6-man volleyball (standard volleyball) on TV or somewhere. So the rule generally played tends to be the mixture of the original 9-man volleyball and standard volleyball.\nPioneerball.\nPioneerball - a game with a ball, similar in its rules to volleyball. Originated in the USSR in the 1930s. The name of the game comes from the fact that it's a game with a ball and was played by pioneers.\nThe game is played with a volleyball on the volleyball court. Each team has from 3 to 8 players. The court is conventionally divided by the number of players into 6 - 7 zones. The first player throws the ball from the far edge of his half of the court over the net to the half of the court of the opposing team. One of the players who catch the ball can make no more than three steps on their half of the court, throw it back over the net to the half of the court of the first team. One of the first team's players also has to catch the ball and make no more than three steps, throw it to the half of the court of the opposing team. And so on until the ball hits the ground, then the team which threw the ball last scores one point. In this game, like in volleyball, players move around the court to the next area in a clockwise direction after winning the ball service. After 15 points, the teams change sides of the field, and play the second set. If the result of the two sets is 1-1, the third set is assigned. And also if the ball hits the net, the score is not counted.\nThe rules of this game are neither officially approved nor recorded, so they may differ slightly from the place to place.\nPioneerball with two balls.\nIt is played by two teams of six to eight players in each squad. The total number of players is 12-16 players. The player of the first team gets one ball, and the player of the second team gets the second ball. They are located at the corners - each on his half of the court, and prepare for the ball service (throwing the ball to the opponent's half of the court) at the referee's whistle. After the whistle the task of each team is to avoid both two balls to be simultaneously situated on their side of the court, if both balls simultaneously touch the hands of the players or land on their side of the court, the opposing team scores a point. The rest of the rules are similar to the basic version of pioneerball.\nThere is also a variation of pioneerball for blind children.\nSepak Takraw.\nSepak Takraw is a variant of volleyball popular in Asia, similar to footvolley. The rules are very similar to those in volleyball, with the following four important exceptions: The use of hands is not permitted, each player may only touch the ball once before it is kicked back over the net, there is no rotation in the defence position and players use their feet to get the ball over the net. The game is played on a badminton doubles court. Another similar game played with the feet and originating in Thailand is Buka ball.\nShooting volleyball.\nIn shooting volleyball the team consists of normally seven players. Three players play at the back side, three players play center of the court, and one player stands in front of the net. Any ball that goes to into the net is to be out by the player who is standing in front of it, also known as\nthe net man.\nSome players also smash the ball with high vertical leaps like Olympic volleyball but there is no setter in team. In this game, the players hit the ball with both hands by punching it with both hands. They try to hit as fast as they can in order to force a mistake from opponent players and try to get rebound as a set ball for any player to smash it with jump, using one hand and if the player standing under the net misses the ball than defender tries to take the ball using the under hand and give maximum height to it.\nWhen one player smashes the ball with great skill the spectators give prize money to that player and the game has to stop at that time.\nShooting volleyball court is and in length. Net height was before some years but nowadays the net height is . The ball size is same to handball. Shooting volleyball is popular in Pakistan (Punjab) (Sindh) (Bloachistan) (KPK), USA and India, especially North Indian States. Most of the above-mentioned rules are not valid at present in shooting volleyball (Pakistan). For example: The height of net has reduced to . Nowadays eight players can play in a team four players play at back side and four at the center of court and one player stands in front of net. If any ball goes into net (called as third ball or 'common ball'), the net man pushes it back to his team and the 'Defencer' (man which is standing in the right center) pushes it towards the back side players (3rd players) of the opponent team. And the players of third hit it forcefully.\nShort court.\nShort court is a fun little volleyball game that can be played with 2 to 8 people. It is normally a game that is played from 10 foot to 10 foot on both sides and the normal side lines. Normally you can have three contacts; but you could make rules up as you go. Sometimes the court down in half if there are only 2 players on each side. All normal volleyball contacts are legal in this game. Jumping to tip and block is also legal as well. There is no official scoring number in this game. It is just a small fun game to play with friends and teammates.\nSitting volleyball.\nSitting volleyball for locomotor-disabled individuals was first introduced in 1956 by the Dutch Sports Committee. International competition began in 1967, but it would be 1978 before the International Sports Organisation for the Disabled (ISOD) sanctioned the sport and sponsored an official international tournament in 1979 at Haarlem, Netherlands.\nThe game is played on a smaller court and with a wide net set to a height of for men and for women. When hitting or attacking the ball, the player must have one \"buttock\" or an extension of the torso still in contact with the floor. Traditionally the sport has been played not only by amputees and people with polio, but people who have orthopedic problems in their knees or ankles. Often players with no sitting volleyball classification are on the club teams. Because of the game's quick pace, the use of your hands to move and play the ball, good balance and a sturdy bottom are a necessity. Consequently, it is not the ideal sport for most paraplegics.\nMen's sitting volleyball was introduced to the Paralympic Games in 1980 and has grown to be one of the more popular Paralympic sports due to the fast and exciting action. Women's sitting volleyball was added to the program for the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens, Greece. The international governing body for the sport is The World Organisation Volleyball for Disabled (WOVD). The WOVD was founded in 1980 in the Netherlands, by the Dutchman Pieter Joon.\nSoft volleyball.\nSoft volleyball is played using a larger rubber volleyball, which is designed to absorb initial impact on the arms. Ideally this type of volleyball is used to introduce the game to first time players and adolescents, with a focus on control, fundamentals of the game and just having fun. The Soft Volleyball is commonly used in Japanese Elementary and Junior Highschools for the very purpose mentioned above. A usual game of Soft Volleyball has four people per side rather than six.\nTraditional volleyball.\nTraditional volleyball has its roots in East Africa, India, and Pakistan. The game is usually played within the Ithna Ashari, Ismaili, Bohra, Kokni, Punjabi, Rajput Dhobi, Lohana, Waniya, Kutchi, Memon and other Asian communities worldwide. Traditional volleyball varies from indoor gymnasium play, outdoor play on sand, grass, or clay - as well as street volleyball for recreation.\nThere is a three-touch system like International volleyball, however, traditional volleyball does not require the bump-set-spike scenario. Instead, traditional volleyball is based on a consistent volley of the ball -only the serving side can score- and players play a style which is considered \"closed hand/fist\" play. The game can be played with up to nine participants per side (similar to Asian nine-man volleyball, but with variations to the game), or as little as five. There is no rotation in traditional volleyball, however, in certain East Indian and Southeast Asian communities, they do allow rotating as the rules tend to vary from team to team. The court can vary from 30' to 30' to as large as '35 by '35.\nThere are several traditional volleyball teams are centered in Eastern Canada. This includes Toronto North, Toronto Jaffery's, RK's Golden Eagles, Toronto Elite, 786'ers, United Stars, Ottawa and many more. Western Canada is also home to several teams, including Vancouver Cosmos, Edmonton, and Calgary. The U.S. boasts a number of teams that practice on a weekly basis, including Houston Heat, Houston Haidari, Sugar Land Strikers, Dallas, New York Union, Allentown Challengers, Allentown Union, Orlando Union, Albuquerque, and other cities. There is a large number of teams in the UK as well with several tournaments each year. UK teams include Stanmore Jaffery's, Birmingham Stars, Preston Simba, Leicester, London, SRDS, and dozens more. The current champions of East Africa are Vyamshala Volleyball Team from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.\nThe weight of the ball varies as well - in North America, they play with a lighter ball, around . of pressure. However, in East Africa, India, and Pakistan, the game is played with a heavier ball, anywhere from of pressure.\nSome of the key positions on the team are Net Center (or nettie). He is responsible for lifting and/or digging the ball out of the net on a second touch. In the old days, the nettie was encouraged to lift the ball up and over the net to the opposing team. As the years went by and the variant styles of the game were changing, the nettie was encouraged to lift the ball back to his team so that they could strike the ball (third touch) to the opposing side and keep the volley going. There was usually one nettie per team back in the old days. Today, teams are allowed to play with up to two netties simultaneously, or even a third nettie on the far right or left corners of the net-thus preventing an advantage of the opposing team to drop or 'dink' the ball.\nThe short center spot is a position that was previously called the 'sweeper'. This position was put into fruition in Canada some years ago, and the object of the short center is to strike the ball into the net as much as he can so that the nettie can give a nice, high, clean lift to his team to strike back to the opposing side.\nThe third and probably most important position is the Long Center (formerly third line). He controls the pace, tempo, and speed of the game - and is instrumental in taking points by a method called flights, floating or shooting. Everyone else on the team, from the front line wings to the backline wings, as well as the serviceman also play crucial roles on the team. The serviceman is not allowed to serve overhand though, and spiking is not allowed on a third touch.\nTraditional Volleyball teams play in local, state, provincial, regional, national, and even international tournaments every year. From Dar es Salaam and Nairobi to Karachi and especially the U.K., the game is growing at rapid rates. In fact, more youth are now playing traditional volleyball than ever before. The hope is that someday this version of volleyball can be played at the Asian Games or even the Olympics.\nUnlike the FIVB, there is no governing body for traditional volleyball. There was an attempt in the mid to late 1990s to form a North American league called TVANA - Traditional Volleyball Association of North America. This league was formed by Ashad Satchu and Nishadali Jiwa and had three successful tournaments in Houston before folding. However, the league was instrumental in uniting U.S. and Canadian teams for the first time in years. The tournaments were also highly energetic and helped usher lasting bonds of friendship, sportsmanship, and competitive play.\nVariations for youth.\nVolley 2000, invented in Sweden in the 1980s, is adapted for young players and other beginners. It is played with the same rules as standard volleyball with some exceptions: net height is 2,00 m, 4 (min. 3) players in the court, one bounce allowed, underhand serve allowed at the 3 m line, no libero. Normally played best in 3 sets, and peers serve as referees in tournaments. National and international tournaments with hundreds of teams are held for players 10–14 years in Northern Europe.\nKidsvolley was invented in Denmark in 2001 and is adapted for 6-9-years-old kids, as a soft introduction to volleyball, in a very entertaining way, divided into level 0 to 2, according to skill level. The ball is caught with the hands, and if it thrown out, in the net or dropped to the floor, the failing player must leave the court. Depending on the level one player can enter again when a ball is received properly, but whenever all 4 team members are \"out\" the other team scores points. In Northern Europe Kidsvolley is used in schools and in volleyball clubs, and local tournaments are arranged by the district volleyball associations.\nIn Germany and Austria, volleyball for youth is played with basically standard rules but smaller courts, lower nets and less players 2,3 or 4), to allow each player have more ball contact and keeping the ball in play for a longer time, thus maintaining a higher level of interest.\nVolleystars is a version of the game used for primary school students. Underarm serves are used instead of overarm, and players are allowed to hold the ball. This is called a 'carry'. There are 9 players in each team, and rotation is in an inverted 'S' shape. It is often played in Interschool Sport matches. \nWallyball.\nWallyball is played in a racquetball court, which is divided into two halves by a net. The game is played like volleyball, with the added complexity that players may carom the ball off a side wall when playing it into the opponents' court. If a ball played over the net contacts the ceiling, the opponent's back wall, or both side walls without being touched by an opponent, the ball is ruled out of bounds. The pace of the game is generally fast, as the confined quarters encourage quick action and the walls often keep the ball conveniently in play."

        "text": "Thomas Jefferson Dowd (April 20, 1869 – July 2, 1933), nicknamed \"Buttermilk Tommy\", was an American Major League Baseball outfielder and second baseman from Holyoke, Massachusetts, who played for six teams during his ten-season career.\nCollege.\nDowd played college baseball at Brown University, and according to an article in the \"Brown Alumni Magazine\":\nNineteenth-century baseball authority Tim Murnane of the \"Boston Globe\" proclaimed Dowd the best center fielder he'd ever seen, especially for his skill at sprinting back on a ball over his head and then turning left or right for the catch. For years Dowd held the unofficial record time for circling the bases.\nMajor Leagues.\nDowd made his major-league debut on April 8, 1891 for the Boston Reds of the American Association. He later played with the Washington Senators, St. Louis Browns, Philadelphia Phillies and Cleveland Spiders in the National League and the Boston Americans in the American League. He was a right-handed batter with a career batting average of .271, and stole 366 bases in his major league career. His final game was September 28, 1901. Dowd has the distinction of being the first Massachusetts native to play for the Americans, as well as the first official player, as he was the leadoff hitter in their first game, a road game in Baltimore.\nDuring the 1891 and 1892 off-seasons, Dowd was the head football coach at Georgetown University.\nCoaching career.\nAfter his career, he coached at Amherst College and Williams College, and managed in several minor and independent leagues. In 1908 he was managing at Hartford, and signed Chick Evans to a contract. Dowd also studied law at Georgetown University. He was given credit for discovering Rabbit Maranville.\nIn 1905, Dowd coached the football team at St. Louis University, leading the Blue and White to a 7–2 record.\nDowd died at the age of 64 in his hometown of Holyoke of accidental drowning. His body was found in the Connecticut River. He is interred at the Calvary Cemetery.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"

        "title": "British ice hockey league champions",
        "text": "The British ice hockey league champions are the winners of the regular season of the highest ice hockey league in the United Kingdom, currently the Elite Ice Hockey League. Previously, the highest league has been the British National League (1954–60), the Premier Division (1983–96) and the Ice Hockey Superleague (1996–2003). \nWhile the regular season winners are recognised as the British League champions, the British champions are regarded as the winners of the end-of-season playoffs, for which the league provides qualification and seeding.\nHistory.\nPrior to the formation of the British National League, England and Scotland each had their own competitions. The English League was founded in 1931 with the Scottish National League being formed a year later. The majority of English League clubs left to form the English National League in 1935, leading the disbandment of the English League at the end of the 1935–36 season. The Scottish National League and English National League both continued until 1954. In that year the decision was taken to amalgamate the two leagues into one. The new competition initially fielded 12 sides in its inaugural season, four from England and eight from Scotland. The Dunfermline Vikings withdrew from the league in early 1955 and at the end of the season six of the seven remaining Scottish sides withdrew, leaving the league with five members. This fell to four following the closure of Harringay Arena in 1958 but increased again to five in 1959 following the admission of Streatham. The league was disbanded following the 1959–60 season.\nFollowing the closure of the British National League, no league competition took place in the United Kingdom for the next six years. Instead clubs, some of which did not have a home rink, participated in rink tournaments. In 1966 the Northern League was formed. This league was made up of teams from Scotland and North East England and was the country's only league for four years. The Southern League was established in 1970 and was divided into the English League North and Inter-City League in 1978. The British Hockey League was formed in 1982 with the Premier Division being launched a season later. There has been a British league continuously since then, although there have been three different organisations and the number of teams taking part has varied from twelve in 1993–94, 1994–95 and 2017–18 to five in 2002–03. The current Elite Ice Hockey League was established in 2003.\nThere has been a British league competition for 47 seasons and 16 teams have won the league championship. The most successful club is the Sheffield Steelers, who have won the championship on ten occasions, followed by the Belfast Giants (7), the Cardiff Devils (6), the now-defunct Durham Wasps (5) and the Coventry Blaze (4). The Nottingham Panthers, the only club to have played in all 47 seasons, have won the title twice (additionally Nottingham were English champions twice before the British National League was formed). The Durham Wasps, Murrayfield Racers, Cardiff Devils, Sheffield Steelers and Coventry Blaze are the only sides to have successfully defended a title.\nTotal titles won.\nTeams in bold are current Elite Ice Hockey League members. Teams in \"italics\" are teams which play outside of the Elite Ice Hockey League. The remaining teams are defunct, although Dundee, Edinburgh (home of the Murrayfield Racers) and Manchester still have their own ice hockey teams.\nTotal titles won by Home Nation.\nEach of the four constituent nations of the United Kingdom have had at least one team who have been British champions. Teams from England have been league champions on 24 occasions, Scottish sides five times, while Welsh side Cardiff Devils and the Northern Ireland based Belfast Giants are the only sides from their parts of the United Kingdom to win the league."

Baxter had led at various points throughout the match and missed crucial darts at doubles in the final set. Barneveld became the first player to retain the Embassy World Championship since Eric Bristow won it in three consecutive years in 1984, 1985 and 1986.\nThe standout match of this championship, however, was the quarter-final between Chris Mason and Martin Adams. Adams looked set for victory when he led 4–1 in sets, but he missed nine darts for the match, and this opened the door for Mason to stage a huge comeback, forcing a final-set tiebreak. Finally, Adams missed a double one which would have forced a sudden-death leg, and Mason hit it to secure a remarkable win. This match also saw no fewer than 29 180s - 16 for Adams and 13 for Mason.\nPrize money.\nThe prize money was £167,200.\nThere was also a 9 Dart Checkout prize of £52,000, along with a High Checkout prize of £2,000."

        "title": "1978 BDO World Darts Championship",
        "text": "The 1978 Embassy World Darts Championship was the first BDO World Darts Championship. The tournament was organised by the British Darts Organisation who had already set up the WDF World Cup and Winmau World Masters in its five years since formation. This was the only year that the tournament was played in a matchplay format of legs, rather than sets which came into operation from 1979 onwards. BBC Television covered the event and began a long broadcasting partnership with the BDO. Sid Waddell was the lead commentator on the tournament which he would cover for the BBC until 1994.\nThe championships became possible when Mike Watterson, a snooker promoter, came up with the idea whilst sat in a barber's chair in 1977. Imperial Tobacco, who already sponsored the World Snooker Championship with their Embassy brand, were also interested and with Watterson promoting the event Imperial also signed up to the darts version, which they were to sponsor for 25 years. The relationship only ended when the UK government decided to end tobacco companies right to sponsor sporting events.\nThe tournament was held between 6 and 10 February. The tournament was held, for the only time, at the Heart of the Midlands Club in Nottingham. The BDO decided to move the event to Jollees Cabaret Club in Stoke-on-Trent for the following year.\nThe third night of the tournament was when tournament began to be lit up when Leighton Rees checked out in ten darts in front of the TV cameras. Eric Bristow was the number one seed for the championship, but suffered a surprise second round defeat to Conrad Daniels of the United States.\nThe number three seed, Leighton Rees of Wales beat number two seed, England's John Lowe 11–7 in the final. He began to pull ahead when a 180 and a 13-dart leg extended his lead from 8–7 to 9–7 and then he took the next two as well for the £3,000 top prize and the title as first ever World Darts Champion\nPrize money.\nTotal Prize fund was £10,500\nTournament review.\n\"Day One – Monday 6 February\"\nThe first days play at the inaugural Embassy World Darts Championships saw 4 first round matches, played over the best of 11 legs. In the opening match, number 1 seed Eric Bristow, a man who would later go on to dominate this event by reaching 10 finals over the 1980s and early 1990s bowed out 6–3 to American Conrad Daniels. Then in an all North American battle, Nicky Virachkul knocked out Hillyard Rossiter 6–0, the first ever World Championship whitewash.\nThe third game saw number 5 seed Alan Evans come through a tricky match against England's Alan Glazier by 6 legs to 4. There would be a Welsh semi-finalist guaranteed after 3rd seed and fellow Welshman Leighton Rees set up a quarter-final on Wednesday after beating Australian Barry Atkinson 6–0.\n\"Day Two – Tuesday 7 February\"\nThe first round would be completed today, in the opening match, 4th seeded Scot Rab Smith would smoothly book a second round spot with a 6–0 win over Irishman Patrick Clifford. He would be up against a Swede before the match would be finished. Stefan Lord, seeded 6 won 6–3 against Kenth Ohlsson. Then the second surprise of the tournament came in defeat for 8th seed Tony Brown of England, 6–3 to Australian namesake Tim Brown. The final match would see John Lowe, the highest seed remaining in the Embassy draw begin with a 6–1 win over Bobby Semple of Scotland.\n\"Day Three – Wednesday 8 February\"\nAll 4 Quarter-Finals were played today, the matches still over the best of 11 legs.\nA change in the broadcasting style – and this change was here to stay. After many complaints the BBC decided to split the screen enabling viewer to see the player's reactions and styles of throw. The first quarter-final saw Conrad Daniels leave the tournament after a great first round win over Eric Bristow, Nick Virachkul going into the semi-finals a 6–4 win.\nThen came arguably one of the best games of the tournament, Evans vs. Rees. Evans took the first two legs in 13 darts, scoring two 180's in the first leg and a 177 in the second leg. Then with Rees 3–2, he took the 6th leg with scores of 137, 180, 180 &amp; double 2 first dart, the first 10 darter on national television. Rees would go on to take the match with a 161 checkout for a 12 darter leg and a place against Virachkul by 6 legs to 3. Both players averaged over 90 during this match, which was unique for this tournament amongst the recorded averages. \nThe bottom half of the draw saw Stefan Lord knock out Rab Smith in a surprising 6–3 win, whilst John Lowe continued his progress in the tournament, a 6–1 win over Tim Brown, a second 6–1 win for Lowe in the tournament so far.\n\"Day Four – Thursday 9 February\"\nThe Semi-Finals and the third place play-off would be held today. Matches in the Semi-Finals being extended to the best of 15 legs, whilst the play-off would be the best of nine legs. Wales would have a finalist in the first ever World Championships, after Rees snuck home in the only match to go all the way, Rees winning 8–7 to end American hopes.\nIn the Second semi-final, John Lowe put out Stefan Lord 8–4 in a comfortable victory, consolation for Virachkul came in victory in the play-off, the American taking home £1000 for his week with Lord taking £800 after the play-off, which Virachkul won 5–4.\nTHE FINAL – Day Five – Friday 10 February\nRees vs. Lowe in a match for £3,000, the loser would take £1,700. Rees would become champion, winning the final by 11 legs to seven."

Listed at and , Chase batted and threw left-handed. He was born in Oneonta, New York.\nA hard-throwing pitcher, Chase entered the majors in 1936 with the Washington Senators, playing six years for them before joining the Boston Red Sox (1942–43) and New York Giants (1943). While in Washington, he was part of a rotation that included Dutch Leonard, Wes Ferrell and Sid Hudson. On April 29, 1939, Ken Chase gave up hit number 2,721 of Lou Gehrig's career. Lou Gehrig never recorded another hit as he willingly pulled himself out of the lineup the next day. He never played another game.\nChase's most productive season came in 1940 with the Senators, when he set career-numbers with 15 wins, a 3.23 ERA, and 129 strikeouts. He struggled with poor control during the season, allowing 143 walks and 12 wild pitches to lead the American League.\nIn an eight-season career, Chase posted a 53–84 record with 582 strikeouts and a 4.27 ERA in 188 games pitched, including 160 starts 62 complete games, four shutouts, and 1165 innings.\nFollowing his playing retirement, Chase ran a dairy business.

        "text": "The 1991 Embassy World Darts Championship was held at the Lakeside Country Club in Frimley Green, Surrey from 4–12 January 1991. Phil Taylor was the reigning World Champion and started off well in the early rounds, before losing in the quarter-finals to Dennis Priestley who took the title. Priestley defeated Eric Bristow by a scoreline of 6-0 in the final. It was the tenth and last of Bristow's world final appearances and the only one in which he failed to win a single set. \nPrize money.\nThe prize fund was £108,200.\nThere was also a 9 Dart Checkout prize of £52,000, along with a High Checkout prize of £1,500.\nSynopsis.\nThe Tournament\n\"Friday 4 January - evening\"\nThere were three first round matches held on the first day of competition at the Lakeside. The opening match of the competition saw Tony Payne of the USA break his Lakeside duck by defeating Chris Johns of Wales 3-1 to advance to the second round. Payne had lost five consecutive years in the First Round. Then Phil Taylor, the number 1 seed began his defence of the World title with a 3-1 win over Martin Phillips of Wales. The reigning champion had a 95.97 average in advancing to a second round match against Tony Payne. In the final match of the day, Bob Sinnaeve defeated Eric Burden in a very tight game, by 3 sets to 2. There was just 1.2 points between the pair of them.\n\"Saturday 5 January - afternoon\"\nIn the first match of day two of the competition saw a big shock with the defeat of Magnus Caris the number 8 seed, knocked out 3-0 by Englishman Dennis Priestley, Dennis recording a 93.30 average in advancing to a match against Bob Sinnaeve. The second match saw Russell Stewart, Phil Taylor's first victim a year ago advance to the last 16 for the fourth time, the first time since 1989. Russ knocked out Knud Nilsen from Norway by 3-0 with 84.87 average. The final game of the afternoon saw very nearly the elimination of the number 5 seed, Bob Anderson for the second year running. He edged Sean Palfrey of Wales by 3 sets to 2 to go through to the second round.\n\"Saturday 5 January - evening\"\n3 more games on Saturday night. In the first, future champion Raymond van Barneveld from the Netherlands made his Lakeside debut, however 11 legs later it was all over. Keith Sullivan dropping just two legs in the battle of the debutants. The second match was a let down for Paul Lim; He had hit a nine dart finish in the 1990 championship and advanced to the quarter-finals before losing 4-0 to Cliff Lazarenko, however this year, faced with a tough first round match against Alan Warriner lost 3-0 and bowed out in the first round. The final game saw Kevin Kenny defeat Albert Anstey 3-2 with an 88.65 average. It was to be the start of a very memorable week for the 29-year-old unseeded Englishman making his second appearance at the Lakeside.\n\"Sunday 6 January - afternoon\"\nThree games on the afternoon of the busiest day of the championship (7 matches in total). The first saw the most eagerly anticipated clash of the first round, Peter Evison (seeded 2) against twice champion John Lowe. The Game, a very tight affair, saw Evison edge through 3-2 with a 91.02 average. The first time, Lowe had been eliminated in the first round at the World Championships. The second game saw the champion from 2 years ago and ever popular Scot Jocky Wilson begin his campaign with a tense 3-2 win over Richie Gardner. Wilson who edged three matches in 1989 in the deciding set brought memories of his last 16 triumph over Alan Warriner.\n\"Sunday 6 January - evening\"\nFour matches tonight, all of them being played in the bottom quarter of the draw. First match on was Ronnie Sharp against Cliff Lazarenko, who had both reached the quarter-finals in 1990 - Sharp taking sets off Taylor. This time, it wasn't a close contest, with Lazarenko entering Round 2 with an easy 3-0 whitewash. Dave Whitcombe, seeded 6 and a seed for the first time since 1989, defeated Per Skau of Denmark with a 3-1 win, as well as an 84.6 average. Skau would enjoy later success at the Lakeside. Mike Gregory, who had lost his seeding (no.4) which he held last year, but to reach the semis again he would need to defeat the man who knocked him out in the last 4 5-2, Eric Bristow. The 3rd Seed defeated Kexi Heinaharju 3-0 to book a slot in the Second Round."

        "title": "Sailing Ship Columbia",
        "text": "The Sailing Ship \"Columbia\", located at the Disneyland park in Anaheim, California, is a full-scale replica of \"Columbia Rediviva\", the first American ship to circumnavigate the globe. The \"Columbia\" has operated in the park for more than fifty years. Passengers of the ship take a 12-minute trip around the Rivers of America. At night, the \"Columbia\" plays the role of a pirate ship in riverfront performances of the park's nighttime show, \"Fantasmic!\"\nHistory.\nWhen Walt Disney decided that the Rivers of America needed more river traffic and wanted another large ship to join the \"Mark Twain\", he asked Joe Fowler, who was Disneyland's construction supervisor and a former naval admiral, to suggest a historic sailing ship for inspiration. After examining every maritime museum in the country, Fowler recommended the first American sailing ship to go around the world: the \"Columbia Rediviva\". However, there is only one known picture in existence of the original vessel. WED researchers used it, along with research materials from the Library of Congress, to design the \"Columbia\".\nArchitect, artist, and marine expert Ray Wallace was commissioned in 1957 to work with Fowler in creating the construction plans, the original designs were sketched out on a napkin by Ray Wallace at a meeting to discuss the final design of the ship. Wallace would later be known for designing the Lady Washington, a replica of the original \"Columbia's\" tender ship, and prop ship for HMS Interceptor in and as Captain Hook's ship in Once Upon a Time. The \"Columbia's\" masts, rigging, spars, and sails were constructed at Todd Shipyards, Los Angeles Division, San Pedro, California, where the \"Mark Twain\"s hull had been built a few years earlier. After Fowler told Disney that it was customary to put a silver dollar under each mast before it was set, Disney personally put one under each of the \"Columbia\"s three masts.\nFor the ship's christening on June 4, 1958, Fowler was dressed as a sailing captain of the 18th century, while the Mouseketeers appeared as his crew. Since then, the sailing ship \"Columbia\" has had many extensive refurbishments, but the only major change has been the addition of the crew quarters exhibit in 1964.\nThe \"Columbia\" was christened by Gretchen Campbell Richmond, wife of Alfred C. Richmond, Commandant of the United States Coast Guard (1954–1962).\nA copy of the \"Columbia\" was planned for Disney World, but it was canceled and replaced with plans to build a second steamboat.\nOn January 11, 2016, the Sailing Ship \"Columbia\", along with the other attractions and shows along the Rivers of America, closed temporarily for the construction of . The ship reopened on July 29, 2017.\nAttraction description.\nPassengers wait for the ship, which departs every 25 minutes, inside a sheltered area called Frontier Landing, located in Frontierland. The waiting area for the \"Columbia\" is shared with the \"Mark Twain\" Riverboat. Historic United States flags are displayed at the attraction's entrance.\nPassengers board the full-scale replica of the original sailing ship \"Columbia\" by climbing steps, also known as the \"brow\", up onto the main deck. Once on board, they can visit a nautical museum below deck, which shows what life was like for the 1787 crew. In addition to the galley, pantry, dry stores, and sick bay, there are quarters for the crew, bosun and bosun's mate, first mate, captain, and surgeon.\nOnce the ship casts off, it begins its voyage around the Rivers of America. The ship, which has three masts and rigging but rarely unfurls its sails, is powered by a compressed natural gas engine (formerly a Marine Detroit Diesel 2-stroke). It runs along the same track as the \"Mark Twain\", hidden by green dye in the water.\nThe captain provides a tongue-in-cheek running commentary as he calls orders to his crew, while recorded background music plays a selection of nautical songs, such as \"Blow the Man Down\". As the ship passes Fort Wilderness on Tom Sawyer Island, a \"Columbia\" cast member fires a 12-gauge blank from one of the ship's ten cannons. The Fort also had a cannon that used to fire back.\nThe Sailing Ship \"Columbia\" operates only on the park's busiest days, or when the \"Mark Twain\" is not operating. The attraction usually opens at 11am and closes at dusk. On evenings when \"Fantasmic!\" is being performed, the ship, which plays the role of the \"Black Pearl\" in the show, will also close at dusk. In previous incarnations of \"Fantasmic!\", the ship served as Captain Hook's pirate ship. When the ship is not operating, it is docked at Fowler's Harbor, near the Haunted Mansion attraction.\nAccidents.\nOn December 24, 1998, a cleat used to secure the ship to the dock tore loose, striking park visitors Luan Phi Dawson, 33, of Duvall, Washington, and his 43-year-old wife Lieu Thuy Vuong in the head, as their son and grandchild and other park visitors looked on. 30-year-old park employee Christine Carpenter of Anaheim, California was also injured. Dawson was declared brain-dead two days later at UCI Medical Center in Orange, California, when his life support system was disconnected.\nSoundtrack.\nCurrent songs (all vocals): \"Blow the Man Down\", \"Clear the Track (Let the Bulgine Run)\", \"One More Day\", \"Rolling Home\" and \"Song of the Fishes\"."

        "text": "The Saint Louis Billikens men's basketball team is the intercollegiate men's basketball program representing Saint Louis University. They compete in the Atlantic 10 Conference. The head coaching position is currently filled by Josh Schertz. Chaifetz Arena is home to the Billikens. The Billikens have reached the championship game of the NIT tournament four times and have won it once (1948). They have appeared in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament ten times, most recently in 2019.\nHistory.\nRick Majerus era.\nOn April 27, 2007, Rick Majerus accepted the head coaching position. His tenure at SLU got off to a rocky start; in their first conference game, the Billikens set an NCAA Division I record for fewest points scored in a game in the modern era of college basketball, losing 49–20 to George Washington. However, as he had done previously at other programs, Majerus eventually made SLU a winning program. In 2012, he led the Billikens to their first NCAA Tournament in 12 years, and their first appearance in a major poll in 17 years.\nOn August 24, 2012, Majerus announced he would not coach the 2012–13 season due to serious heart problems. Jim Crews, one of his assistants, took over for him on a temporary basis for that season. On November 16, it was announced that Majerus was retiring when it was apparent that his heart condition would not improve enough to allow him to return.\nMajerus compiled a 95–69 (.579) record at St. Louis University and retired with an overall NCAA record of 517–215 (.706).\nJim Crews era.\nJim Crews was promoted to head coach after serving on an interim basis following the health concerns and eventual death of Majerus. He was on Majerus' staff since 2011. After leading the Billikens to a school-record 28 wins, Crews was formally named SLU's 25th head coach on April 12, 2013. He was fired after the 2016 Atlantic 10 tournament resulted in the elimination of the Billikens and marked the end of two 11–21 Billikens seasons. Crews was paid a $1.86 million buyout in 2016-17, according to tax forms.\nTravis Ford era.\nOn March 30, 2016, Saint Louis University announced that Travis Ford has been hired as the head basketball coach. He inherited a Billikens team that had gone a disappointing 11–21 each of the previous two seasons under Jim Crews. Due to a lack of talent from the previous regime, SLU was predicted to finish dead last of the Atlantic 10 conference during the 2016–17 season. Basketball statistician Ken Pomeroy predicted the Billikens as the team most likely to go winless throughout its conference schedule. Ford led the Billikens to six Atlantic 10 conference wins and a 12–21 overall record. The Billikens and Travis Ford gained the attention of national news in January 2024 after it was discovered Travis Ford's son created a burner Twitter account to defend his dad as fans and people online were calling for him to be fired.\nTravis Ford and SLU parted ways concluding the 2023-24 season. \nPostseason appearances.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Billikens have appeared in ten NCAA Tournaments. Their combined record is 6–11.\nNIT results.\nThe Billikens have appeared in 20 National Invitation Tournaments (NIT). Their combined record is 18–19. They were NIT champions in 1948 and runner-up in 1961, 1989, and 1990.\nCBI results.\nThe Billikens have appeared in one College Basketball Invitational (CBI). Their record is 3–2 and they were the CBI runnerup in their only appearance.\nIndividual honors.\nHonored jerseys.\nJerseys were honored/retired, but numbers remained active and can be chosen by future players"

        "text": "Loafing, floating, or cherry picking in ice hockey is a manoeuver in which a player, the floater (usually a forward, but occasionally a defenceman who used to play the forward position, but can no longer skate the complete length of the ice at pace), literally loafs — spends time in idleness — or casually skates behind the opposing team's unsuspecting defencemen while they are in their attacking zone. It is very similar to the cherry picking tactic sometimes used in basketball. Its controversy is also very similar to that of cherry picking in basketball.\nHistory.\nThe tactic is used sparingly as although it sometimes creates a breakaway opportunity for the defending team should they manage to take control of the puck and pass it to the floater, it also creates a five-on-four situation (during even strength play) for the attacking team. Also, a good defenceman usually keeps an eye open for the development of these potential situations where he would immediately backcheck once a floater is spotted.\nExample of loafing players.\nAlex Gaudreault"

He won a bronze medal in the men's 5,000 metres race. With that bronze medal, Belgium finished in joint 22nd place on the medal table.\nBackground.\nBelgium has been participating in the Olympic movement almost since the beginning, with their first appearance coming at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris. They have competed in every Winter Olympic Games except for the 1960 and 1968 editions. Coming into Nagano, they had won four medals in Winter Olympic competition, but none since the 1948 Winter Olympics. The only Belgian representative to qualify for Nagano was speed skater Bart Veldkamp, who had previously won medals in the 10,000 metres race in both Albertville and Lillehammer. Conrad Alleblas, Veldkamp's manager, was chosen as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony.\nMedalists.\nWith one bronze medal, Belgium ranked a joint 22nd in the medal table.\nSpeed skating.\nBard Veldkamp was 30 years old at the time of the Nagano Olympics. Although Veldkamp was born in the Netherlands, he chose to take Belgian nationality in 1996 to make it easier to qualify for major competitions. Veldkamp had won gold for the Netherlands at the 1992 Winter Olympics and bronze for the Netherlands at the 1994 Winter Olympics, and would go on to represent Belgium at the 2002 Winter Olympics and the 2006 Winter Olympics. On 8 February, he took part in the 5,000 metres race. He went out early and set a new world record, only for two more world records to be set that day, leaving him in third place and the winner of the bronze medal. On 12 February, despite being a distance specialist, he participated in the 1,500 metres, and finished 17th with a time of 1 minute and 51.73 seconds. In the 10,000 metres, on 17 February, he skated in the final pairing, and finished fourth with a time of 13 minutes and 29 seconds, which was less than a second and a half behind the bronze medal time."

        "text": "Ryan Joseph Sweeney (born February 20, 1985) is an American former Major League Baseball outfielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago White Sox, Oakland Athletics, Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs.\nEarly life.\nSweeney was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and originally attended Jefferson High School, but conflict between winter showcase games and regular high school basketball schedule obligations led him to transfer to and graduate from cross-town Xavier High School in Cedar Rapids in 2003.\nBaseball career.\nMinor leagues.\nHe had originally planned to play for Tony Gwynn at San Diego State University, but signed with the Chicago White Sox after they chose him in the 2nd round of the 2003 MLB draft.\nSweeney played in the White Sox minor league organization from 2003 to 2006, including: Bristol (Appalachian League) and Great Falls (Pioneer League) in 2003; Winston-Salem (Carolina League) in 2004; Birmingham (Southern League) in 2005; and Charlotte (International League) in 2006.\nChicago White Sox.\nIn 2006, he was called up to the White Sox, and played in 21 games for the major league team. At the beginning of the 2007 season, Ryan was ranked by Baseball America as prospect No. 1 in the White Sox organization. That year he played in 15 games for the White Sox and 105 for the Charlotte Knights.\nOakland Athletics.\nOn January 3, , the White Sox traded him, along with fellow prospects pitchers Fautino de los Santos and Gio González, to Oakland for outfielder Nick Swisher. He played in 8 games for the AAA Pacific Coast League Sacramento River Cats before being called up to the major league team, where he played in 116 games. Sweeney remained with the A's through 2011.\nBoston Red Sox.\nOn December 28, 2011, Sweeney and Andrew Bailey were traded to the Boston Red Sox for Josh Reddick, Miles Head and Raúl Alcántara.\nSweeney played in 63 games for the Red Sox during the 2012 season. On November 30, 2012 he was among those not offered a contract for 2013 by the Red Sox, and became a free agent.\nOn January 26, 2013 the Red Sox signed Sweeney to a minor league contract which would pay him $1.25 million plus incentives if he made the major league team. Sweeney was signed to provide additional outfield depth when the team learned that Ryan Kalish required surgery and would miss at least part of the 2013 season.\nAt the end of spring training in March, 2013, Sweeney was not added to Boston's major league roster. Rather than accept assignment to the minor leagues, he opted out of his contract and became a free agent.\nChicago Cubs.\nSweeney signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs on April 2, 2013.\nOn May 6, 2013 the Cubs announced that Sweeney would be joining the major league team, with Dave Sappelt moving to the Cubs' Triple-A affiliate to make room on the Cubs roster for Sweeney. On May 8, 2013, Sweeney recorded his first hit as a Chicago Cub. Sweeney's first home run as a Cub came on May 19, 2013 at Wrigley Field. On June 15, Sweeney took over as the starting center fielder when David DeJesus sprained his shoulder running into a wall. On June 29, Sweeney fractured his rib while running into a wall making a catch against the Mariners. Brian Bogusevic then became the starting center fielder. On September 1, he returned to the Cubs, receiving the bulk of the starts in center field to end the year.\nIn 2013, Sweeney played 70 games with the Cubs and hit .266/.324/.448 with 6 HR and 19 RBI. On October 8, Sweeney signed a two-year, $3.5 million deal with a $2.5 million option for 2016. He would earn $1.5 million annually, and the option had a $500,000 buyout. In 77 games in 2014, Sweeney hit .251 with 3 home runs and 20 RBI's. He went on the disabled list on August 27 with a left hamstring strain.\nSweeney was designated for assignment by the Cubs on April 5, 2015, and released on April 7.\nMinnesota Twins.\nOn December 17, 2015 the Minnesota Twins announced that Sweeney was one of several players who received a minor league contract and an offer to attend the Twins' spring training. He was released on March 25, 2016."

The unofficial concept of a \"champion county\" took a new turn when periodicals began publishing tables of inter-county results, although there was still no formal or agreed method of deciding positions in the table.

        "text": "James Joseph Sweeney (September 1, 1929 – February 8, 2013) was an American college football coach who was the head coach at Montana State University (1963–1967), Washington State University (1968–1975), and California State University, Fresno (1976–1977, 1980–1996), compiling a career college football record of Sweeney's 144 wins at Fresno State are the most in the program's history. He was also an assistant coach in the National Football League (NFL). He played in college as an end for the Portland Pilots.\nEarly years.\nBorn in Butte, Montana, Sweeney was the youngest of seven children of Will and Kate Sweeney; his father was a hard-rock miner who emigrated from Ireland. As a youth in Butte, he was a top pitcher and outfielder in baseball, and graduated from Butte Central Catholic High School in 1947.\nSweeney played college football as an end at the University of Portland in Oregon, and graduated in 1951. After his junior year, the school dropped football as an intercollegiate sport, and Sweeney spent his senior season of 1950 as a high school coach at Columbia High School in Portland.\nCoaching career.\nFollowing graduation, Sweeney returned to Montana and was a high school assistant at his alma mater, Butte Central, for a season. He was its head coach from 1952 to 1955, then at Flathead High School in Kalispell from 1956 to 1959. Sweeney moved up to the college ranks in 1960 as an assistant coach at Montana State in Bozeman under Herb Agocs, and was promoted to head coach in 1963. He compiled a record and three Big Sky Conference championships in his five seasons with the Bobcats, where one of his starting quarterbacks was Dennis Erickson. Sweeney's salary at MSU in 1967 was $15,000.\nAt Montana State, Sweeney is credited with convincing Jan Stenerud, a Norwegian on a ski jumping scholarship (three-time Big Sky champion), to go out for the football team as a kicker. Stenerud went on to become the only \"pure\" kicker inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nAfter his success in Bozeman, Sweeney moved up to the Pac-8 Conference at Washington State in Pullman, where he started with a one-year contract at $20,000 in 1968. He had only one winning season (1972) and compiled a record in eight seasons. His team's most noteworthy accomplishment was the defeat of Rose Bowl-bound Stanford in 1971 to garner him NCAA District 8 Coach of the Year honors. One of his notable hires in Pullman was WSU alumnus Jack Elway, father of future hall of fame quarterback John Elway. After a disappointing conclusion to the 1975 season (winless in conference), Sweeney resigned at WSU a week after the season ended.\nPromptly hired at Fresno State, Sweeney led the Bulldogs for two seasons before becoming a National Football League (NFL) assistant for two years. He spent the season with the Oakland Raiders in John Madden's final and the season with the St. Louis Cardinals under Bud Wilkinson, who was fired before the season's end. Sweeney returned to Fresno State as head coach in December 1979 for 17 more seasons; he compiled a record and eight conference championships (PCAA/Big West and WAC) in 19 seasons. Sweeney retired from coaching following the 1996 season with 201 wins in 32 seasons. He was most proud of the 1977 team (9–2), and credited them as the \"stadium builders\", because their success got the local community motivated to fund and construct Bulldog Stadium, which opened in 1980.\nPersonal life.\nSweeney was the father of nine children: Jim, Peggy, Sheila, Carol, Mary Lou (Dion), Daniel, Colline, Patty (Negrete), and Kevin Sweeney, whom he coached at Fresno State. His wife and mother of all his children, Lucille (Cile) Carollo Sweeney, was his high school sweetheart from Butte; she died at age 57 in 1988 from an intracranial hemorrhage. He later married June Sweeney and they resided in Fresno. Two of his grandsons played Pac-10 football: Nate Fellner at Washington and Kyle Negrete at USC. Sweeney's grandson, Beau, played at California before transferring in 2011.\nSweeney died in Fresno in 2013 at age 83. He and his wife had recently moved to a senior living home due to his failing health, which included a stay at St. Agnes Medical Center."

Prior to turning professional Wright spent four years at the University of Toronto, and also briefly played in the minor American Hockey League before retiring in 1975.\nAmateur career.\nBorn in Toronto, Ontario, Wright was selected 4th overall in the 1966 NHL Amateur Draft by his hometown Toronto Maple Leafs after dominating local Junior B ranks. The following season, he joined the Toronto Marlboros of the Ontario Hockey Association, where he would play with a host of future NHL stars, including Brad Park, Brian Glennie and Gerry Meehan. In his rookie season, Wright helped lead the Marlboros to the Memorial Cup as Canada's top junior team, scoring 5 points in 9 games in the final tournament. The following season, he emerged as one of the team's top players, registering 64 points in 54 games.\nHowever, rather than turn professional at the conclusion of his junior career, Wright chose instead to attend the University of Toronto, where he would pursue a degree in Health and Physical Education. During his time with the Varsity Blues men's ice hockey team, he would establish himself as one of the top players in CIAU history. The team would win 4 consecutive CIAU University Cup championships during his time there, with Wright becoming the only (as of 2021) player to be a two-time winner of the national tournament's Most Valuable Player award (1969, 1972). He was honoured as a CIAU All-Canadian in 1969 and 1972, and captained the Blues during his final two seasons.\nWright was also a member of the university's golf team, and in 1994 was elected to the University of Toronto Hall of Fame for his athletic achievements during his time there.\nProfessional career.\nWright had been drafted away from the Maple Leafs by the Vancouver Canucks in 1970, and joined the team in 1972 at the conclusion of his university career. Wright made the team as a rookie, and put together a fine 1972–73 season, finishing with 10 goals and 37 points in 71 games. This placed him 5th on the team in assists and 8th in scoring, and his 27 assists were at the time the most ever by a rookie Canuck forward.\nHowever, Wright would get off to a sluggish start in 1973–74 with just 6 points in his first 20 games, and was dealt to the St. Louis Blues for Mike Lampman. His offensive struggles would continue in St. Louis, and he finished the season with 6 goals and 15 points in 52 games between Vancouver and St. Louis.\nThe following summer, Wright was selected by the Kansas City Scouts in the 1974 NHL Expansion Draft. However, he would play only 4 games for the Scouts, instead spending almost the entire season with their farm squad in the AHL. Following the season, he chose to retire from professional hockey.\nWright finished his career with 16 goals and 52 points, along with 67 PIM, in 127 NHL games."

The Marathon begins near the Melrose Plantation and ends at Front Street in Natchitoches. The regatta is open to all sculling and sweep-oar rowing boats. On the day of the Marathon, the Cane River is open only to competitors.\nThe regatta is much longer than most head races, but shorter than the Boston Rowing Marathon. Normally, the races with the longest distance that competitive crews enter are called head races (for example the Head of the Charles) and are usually around long. The majority of crews do not even practice on bodies of water that allow them to row without stopping and turning around (usually due to lake size or the presence of a river dam or lock).\nThe Marathon Rowing Championship did not take place in 2010 or 2011 due to low water during an extreme regional drought.\nThe record time for this event is 2 hours, 31 minutes, 20 seconds set in 2008. A more typical time it takes to complete the course is 3 to 4 hours."

Ladbrokes, who sponsored the event initially for one year in 2003, decided to extend their deal and the prize fund was increased to £256,000.

        "text": "The 2002 PDC World Darts Championship was a professional darts tournament held from 28 December 2001 to 5 January 2002 at the Circus Tavern in Purfleet, Essex. It was the ninth staging of the competition beginning with the 1994 edition and the ninth time it was held at the Circus Tavern. The competition was the first of 30 Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) tournaments in the 2002 season.\nNine-time world champion Phil Taylor whitewashed second-time finalist Peter Manley 7–0 in the final. It was a rematch of the final of the 1999 PDC World Championship, which Taylor also won. Taylor won his eighth consecutive world championship and tenth overall. He defeated Paul Williams, Shayne Burgess, the 2001 tournament runner-up John Part, and Dave Askew on his way to the final. Taylor also achieved a 167 checkout, the highest of the competition, in his second round match against Burgess.\nTournament summary.\nBackground.\nThe Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) was established under the World Darts Council name by the managers John Markovic, Tommy Cox and Dick Allix and the world's top 16 players in January 1992 as a separate body from the British Darts Organisation (BDO). The PDC World Darts Championship was first held in 1994 and is one of two world championships in the game of darts: the other being the BDO World Darts Championship. The 2002 tournament was held between 28 December 2001 and 5 January 2002 in Purfleet, Essex, and was the first of 30 PDC-sanctioned events in the 2002 season. It was the ninth edition of the tournament and featured a 32-player main draw that was played at the Circus Tavern.\nA total of 31 players automatically qualified for the main draw with 16 of them seeded. Alan Warriner was seeded first and Phil Taylor was the second seed. The remaining place was decided by a play-off round contested by members of the Professional Dart Players Association at the Beaufort Arms, Birmingham on 8 December 2001. Matt Chapman was the player who advanced from qualifying to the main draw, making his debut and only appearance at the tournament. Six more players debuted in the competition: Ronnie Baxter, Steve Beaton, Andy Jenkins, Chris Mason, Kevin Painter and Paul Williams after they moved to the PDC from the BDO. The maximum number of sets contested in a match increased from seven in the first round to eleven from the second round to the semi-finals, leading up to the final which was played as best-of-thirteen sets. Sponsored by the lager company Skol, the tournament had a total prize fund of £205,000, and the host broadcaster was Sky Sports.\nBookmakers and pundits considered Taylor the favourite to claim his eighth world championship in a row and tenth overall. Taylor said he had practised heavily to prepare for the tournament after he lost to Painter in the first round of the World Grand Prix: \"I'm hungrier than I've ever been, so all those players who feel I can be beaten are going to be shown I am out to win and no one will be in my way. I have been doing loads of practice, three or four hours a day. I'm feeling good.\"\nRound 1.\nThe draw for the first round of the championship was televised live on Sky Sports News and conducted by the broadcaster Sid Waddell, the director of the world championship Tommy Cox, and Painter in the late afternoon on 10 December 2001. The first round of the competition, in which all 32 players participated, took place from 28 and 30 December 2001. In this round the 2001 World Grand Prix champion Warriner defeated Reg Harding 4–2. Warriner won the first two sets before Harding took sets three and five for a 3–2 scoreline. He beat Harding 3–2 in the sixth set to win the match. Warriner said afterwards that his performance was inadequate. Colin Lloyd won 4–2 over Alex Roy after he came from 2–0 behind in the first and completing the fourth set with a 100 checkout. World number five and World Grand Prix semi-finalist Dennis Smith achieved the tournament's first whitewash when he defeated Paul Lim 4–0; Lim won only three legs during the match. \nFormer world champion and eighth ranked Richie Burnett compiled checkouts of 142 and 124 points to defeat Peter Evison 4–1, a game which saw Evison fail to complete a nine-dart finish in the first leg of the third set after one of his darts landed less than away from the double 18 outer ring. Baxter achieved a three-dart average of 103 to defeat Painter 4–2. He led 3–1 before Painter won set five; Baxter won with a finish on the double 16 inner ring. The Irish Masters champion Denis Ovens converted a two-set deficit to Jenkins to force a final set decider which he won to claim a 4–3 victory. World number four Peter Manley achieved set victories of 3–1 and 3–0 to lead Steve Brown 2–0. Brown made a 115 checkout to win the third set before Manley took sets four and five to win 4–1 and progress to the second round of a PDC tournament for the first time since October 2000. In his 25th world championship appearance, John Lowe came from one set against Les Fitton to win four sets in a row. Lowe finished on the double nine outer ring to win 4–1. \nShayne Burgess defeated Jamie Harvey 4–3; trailing 2–1 Burgess took the first two legs of set four and another three to equal the scoreline. He then took the next set before Harvey forced a final set decider. Checkouts of 111 and 85 put Burgess ahead until Harvey reduced his advantage. Harvey then missed five dart throws to land in an outer double ring and Burgess won the match. Another 4–3 victory occurred when Steve Beaton defeated Bob Anderson after leading 3–1 and Anderson won two sets in a row. After winning the sixth set, Beaton forced a final set decider, which he won 5–3. Taylor achieved a three-dart average of 98.2 points in defeating Paul Williams 4–1. Dave Askew defeated the English Open champion Mason 4–3 in a seven-set match. The World Grand Prix runner-up Roland Scholten won 4–1 over Cliff Lazarenko. Scholten took the opening set before Lazarenko made a 82 checkout to win the second. Scholten won three consecutive sets to enter the second round.\nJohn Part, the runner-up of the 2001 edition, won 4–2 against Mick Manning. Part took the first two sets and Manning the third. Manning compiled a 110 checkout and had a finish on the double ten outer ring to win set four after Part missed five chances to hit an outer double ring. Part then won six legs in a row to win the match. World number three Rod Harrington beat Keith Deller, the 1983 world champion, 4–3. Tied 2–2, Harrington argued with Deller about a perceived positioning of Deller's left leg in retrieving his darts from the board and the time it took to do so. That caused Harrington to clip Deller's heel while he was throwing, which he did not admit to doing until 2016. Deller won the fifth set with a finish on the outer double 16 ring. Harrington took the sixth set to force a final set decider, which he won on a 58 checkout. Harrington kicking Deller was the catalyst for the creation of the exclusion zone, an area that players are not allowed to enter when their opponent is in action. In the first round's final match the two-time world champion Dennis Priestley lost a solitary set in a 4–1 win over Chapman.\nRound 2.\nThe second round was played to the best-of-11 sets from 30 December 2000 and 2 January 2001. Lloyd became the first player through to the quarter-finals with a 6–4 victory over Warriner, who was the first player ranked in the top ten to lose in the tournament. Lloyd took the first three sets before Warriner took a 4–3 lead. He then recovered to win the match, calling it \"one of the best performances of my career.\" Burnett took more than two hours to defeat Ovens 6–4 after neither player led by more than a set until the end of the match. Baxter took a little more than one hour to beat Smith 6–1. He claimed the first set and Smith the second. Baxter's higher finishing average won him six consecutive legs in the middle of the game en route to victory. Manley defeated Lowe 6–5. He took the lead in set one before Lowe claimed the second with a 121 checkout. Lowe won sets three and four to take the lead until Manley nullified this to tie the match. The game went to a final set decider which Manley won 3–0. After the match, Manley said he had not expected a strong performance from Lowe.\nTaylor had a three-dart average of 111.21 points, completed respective checkouts of 140 and 167 points and two finishes of ten dart throws to defeat Burgess 6–1; Burgess won four legs during the game's concluding two sets. Askew overcame a challenge from Scholten to win 6–3. Both players equalled each other's form before Askew moved ahead with victories in the fifth and sixth sets. Scholten subsequently made a 13-dart finish to claim set seven before Askew replied to win the next two sets and the match. Part compiled ten maximum scores (180), checkouts of 116 and 117 and achieved a three-dart average of 98.68 points to complete a 6–0 whitewash of Beaton. The final second round match saw Priestley play the two time World Matchplay champion Harrington. After both players began at a slow pace with Harrington compiling high scores and missing checkouts and Priestley making checkouts without high scores, the latter took the lead in the match and a 6–3 victory after Harrington failed to complete a 169 checkout.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe four quarter-finals were played as best-of-11 sets on 3 January 2002. The first quarter-final match was played between Lloyd and Burnett. Although Burnett was heavily favoured to win, Lloyd took a 5–0 lead and appeared set to complete a 6–0 whitewash until Burnett won four consecutive sets to go 5–4 behind. Lloyd took three successive legs to win the match 6–4 and was the first player to earn a semi-final berth. Lloyd said post-match that he was surprised over his early lead: \"I've played good darts in the last three games but I've let them come back at me. But the main thing about my play this year is that I haven't let my head drop. They have come back at me but I've said 'keep fighting Lloydy' and you're going to get there. That's what's made the difference. I'm not going to give up.\" The second game had Askew take an early lead over Priestley until the latter won two sets in a row to lead 2–1. Askew then tied the match at 2–2 and took four more sets and made a 100 checkout to win 6–2.\nIn the next quarter-final, pre-match favourite Baxter played Manley. Both players shared the first four sets before Manley achieved a 123 checkout in the fifth set to move into a clear lead. Manley claimed three more sets for a 6–2 victory. The final match of the quarter-finals saw Taylor play Part in a rematch of the 2001 world championship final. Taylor took the first three sets before he achieved seven maximums and failed to complete a nine-dart finish in the fourth set when his eighth dart throw landed inside the single seven ring. He then completed a 6–0 whitewash of Part after he won two more sets and had achieved a three-dart average of 100.23 points; Part forced a final leg decider in the fifth and sixth sets before Taylor defeated him. Taylor admitted he had not expected to whitewash Part: \"I thought I would be beat him but not so easily. I think John is a better player than that. The way he played against Steve Beaton was brilliant and no one beats Steve 6–0 easily.\"\nSemi-finals.\nBoth of the semi-finals were best-of-11 sets on 4 January 2002. The first semi-final pitted Manley against Lloyd. Manley won the first set and Lloyd the second from checkouts of 105, 137 and 46. Lloyd took the third set after Manley produced a 111 checkout from eleven darts thrown. Both players shared the following two sets; Manley took the fourth on the outer double ten ring and Lloyd the fifth from checkouts of 134 and 91. Manley won sets six and seven and Lloyd the eighth. Manley retook the lead after the ninth set and claimed a 6–4 victory after the final set went to a fifth leg which he won on the outer double eight ring. Lloyd made ten maximums to Manley's eight. Manley said he was annoyed with the easy removal of flights on Lloyd's darts and felt the latter slowed the match. Lloyd stated a warm arena reduced his hand grip and denied employing gamesmanship to slow Manley.\nTaylor faced Askew in the other semi-final. Askew took the first two legs of the first set. Taylor came from behind to claim the set after Askew missed four opportunities to hit a double in its third leg. Taylor subsequently won the next six legs to lead 3–0. Askew ended the streak by winning one leg in the fourth set as Taylor secured the set. Taylor then took sets five and six for a 6–1 win, only losing one leg in each of the final two sets. Post-match Taylor said Askew had put him under pressure: \"I could feel Dave was under pressure from the start and I knew that if he hit 140, then I had to follow him. I just kept on top of him\", and commented on Manley's challenge to him, \"It's either going to be a walkover or a cracker, and I think it will be a good match. Peter will push me, but If I push him back he'll go.\"\nFinal.\nThe final between Manley and Taylor on 5 January 2002 was contested as the best-of-13 sets. To reach the 2002 final, Taylor had defeated Paul Williams, Shayne Burgess, John Part and Dave Askew, while Manley had beaten Steve Brown, John Lowe, Ronnie Baxter and Colin Lloyd. This was Taylor's eleventh world championship final and his ninth in a row in the PDC. He had previously won the world championship nine times in 1990, 1992, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001. Manley appeared in his second world championship final, having finished runner-up to Taylor in the 1999 tournament.\nTaylor won the first set 3–0. Manley was unable to land a dart in the outer double 20 ring in the second set before he completed a checkout on the outer double ten ring to win his first leg of the match. He then was unable to convert eight more opportunities and Taylor's finishing allowed him to clinch set two 3–1. In the third set Taylor produced a 104 checkout and a 13-dart finish to win it 3–0. Taylor led the fourth set 2–0 when he failed to convert a 100 checkout and Manley won the third leg. He then responded to compile a 11-dart finish and take the set. The fifth set saw Manley win his first leg after he missed the outer double eight ring on his first try. Taylor took four legs in a row to win the fifth set 3–1 and the sixth 3–0. In the first leg of the final set, Manley was unable to land a dart in the outer double ten ring and Taylor whitewashed him 7–0 to win the world championship. It was Taylor's tenth world championship win and eighth in a row; he won £50,000 for winning the tournament and a further £1,000 for compiling its highest checkout, a 167.\nAfter the match, Manley did not shake Taylor's hand and walked off the stage to use the urinal facilities. He later shook Taylor's hand but not before the crowd booed him. Taylor said he was delighted to win the championship and represented Manley leaving the stage as less important than it was: \"What you must remember is all the professionals are winners and Peter deserved to be up here in the final. He was gutted but he came back and shook my hand and that is the end of it. It is extra special because it is £50,000 and I do feel sorry for people who had a bet on a nine-darter because with me and Pete I thought it might come.\" Taylor said he wanted to win 13 world championships because it is his lucky number. Manley said he enjoyed playing in the final and complimented Taylor's ability: \"I had some hard games to come through and I beat my mate Ronnie Baxter and he would probably have been a better player to beat Phil tonight. But Phil is the greatest player ever to walk the earth.\"\nWriting for \"The Daily Telegraph\" journalist Simon Hughes felt Taylor's tenth world championship had exceeded the achievements of the snooker players Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry and the rower Steve Redgrave. Mel Webb of \"The Times\" felt Taylor's number of world championships was unlikely to be eclipsed by other players bar Taylor himself: \"Nobody, not even Tiger Woods or Don Bradman, has dominated his sport as overwhelmingly as Taylor does his.\"\nPrize fund.\nThe breakdown of prize money for 2002 is shown below.\nDraw.\nNumbers given to the left of players' names show the seedings for the top 16 in the tournament.

Ryder is well known within the rugby sevens community, as he has produced some of the best performances for the Fiji national sevens side. He is well known for his try scoring capability and goosestepping defenders. He was also one of the top try scorers of the World Sevens Series which has been overtaken recently. He has scored over 752 points to-date of which he has scored 105 tries. He was a part of the team that won the sevens world cup in 2005 and also won a bronze medal at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Australia for the rugby sevens event.\nRyder played club rugby in Japan with Toyota Verblitz but he left and joined the Fiji sevens team for the 2009–10 IRB Sevens World Series. On 17 May 2011 it was announced that he had signed for Stade Montois. He wanted to join the Fiji team in 2013 under the guidance of Ben Ryan for the first time in 3 years but was left from the final squad as Ryan stated he is not as fit as he was three years ago.

        "text": "The Mindanao Visayas Basketball Association (MVBA) was a community-based amateur commercial basketball league in Southern Philippines sanctioned by the country's National Sports Association for basketball, the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP). The league is made up of teams from the Visayas and Mindanao. Formal operations began on February 25, 2006 with the opening of the ML Kwarta Padala First Conference at the MSU-IIT Gym in Iligan City, Lanao del Norte. Forward Mark Bonifacio of Montana Pawnshop-Davao made the first basket in league history during the opening game versus PacMan-GenSan.\nThe league is a brainchild of multi-titled coach and Cebu City Councilor Raul \"Yayoy\" D. Alcoseba, who wanted to have a Vis-Min league managed by Vis-Min people and based in the area. With the financial backing of sports patron Michel J. Lhuillier, the dream became a reality in late 2005 as Alcoseba and his staff began the groundwork by talking to potential team owners and sponsors.\nFormer FIBA referee Jose \"Boy\" Murillo and PBA legend Wilfredo \"Willy\" Generalao were named as the MVBA's two co-equal commissioners, with Murillo in charge of the Visayas games and Generalao in Mindanao. Gov. Oscar S. Moreno, team owner of Misamis Oriental, was unanimously elected as the MVBA's Chairman.\nIn 2008, it merged with the National Basketball Conference (NBC), and Third Force Inc. (TFI) to form the new Liga Pilipinas.\nMVBA Champions.\nThe league holds two long tournaments or conferences every season. In between, a sprinkling of brief tournaments are held either as a warm-up for the coming conference or in honor of a special occasion.\nPBA Call-Ups.\nThe MVBA is proud that several of its alumni have made it to the professional Philippine Basketball Association (PBA). Aside from rookies, several free agents have received their second chance at pro stardom after credible performances in the MVBA. This listing is limited to those players who saw action in the regular conferences.\nMVBA Venues.\nIn only two years, the MVBA has been literally around, playing official games in almost every major city or urban area in the Visayas and Mindanao.\nMedia coverage.\nThe MVBA games are broadcast via UHF station Cebu Catholic Television Network (CCTN-47) daily at 3:30PM, Philippine Standard Time. The station's signal covers most of the Visayas and parts of Northern Mindanao. The MVBA broadcast panel is a combination of veteran and up and coming commentators led by Sandi Geronimo-Grumo, Randy Sacdalan, Anthony Servinio, John Montalvan and Brian Madronero.\nAside from television, the MVBA enjoys good print coverage from both local and national newspapers, tabloids and magazines. An official league website is in the works for 2008. For the moment, the MVBA has maintained a deal with Gameface.Ph as its official Internet media partner since 2006."

It also made Gregory the first player to miss darts at double to win a world championship and eventually lose; none would match this until Mark McGeeney in 2018.\nTaylor took full advantage and sent the match to a sudden-death leg, which he won to take his second World title. Taylor's match-winning average of 97.58 remained a record for a BDO world championship final until the tournament's demise in 2020.\nPrize money.\nThe prize fund was £116,400.\nThere was also a 9 Dart Checkout prize of £52,000, along with a High Checkout prize of £1,500."

In particular, the first hole is often rated as one of the best opening holes in the world. Jack Nicklaus has cited the 1st at Machrihanish as the top opening hole in the world.\nThe golf club was founded in 1876 as the Kintyre Golf Club. The course had ten holes before the club officially existed, and was quickly expanded to 12. In 1879, Old Tom Morris was brought in to redesign and expand the course to the full 18 holes, including today's first hole. J.H. Taylor made some modifications in 1914, and in the 1940s Sir Guy Campbell brought the course to its current configuration.\nThe club is ranked #57 in Golf Digest's World's 100 Greatest Golf Courses 2015 list.\nThe club also has a shorter 9-hole golf course, and separate men's and women's clubhouses. It has hosted the Scottish Ladies Championship on several occasions. The clubhouse, which provided a bar and restaurant, both of which were open to the public, was completely destroyed in a fire in December 2018."

Bristow did so.\nBristow later said: \"This was the final that changed the game of darts forever.

All clubs were invited to participate, about 100 of them took part, with the first division teams joining in during the last rounds.\nThe 1951 final was so violent that the Rugby Football Union asked for it to be discontinued, otherwise France could have been expelled from the Five Nations Tournament which they had just rejoined in 1939. And this was exactly what the chairman of the French Federation did. It was replaced the next year by the Challenge Yves du Manoir which had been ended by the war.\nThe competition was reborn in the mid-1980s under the impulse of the then president of the French Federation, Albert Ferrasse, in parallel with both the championship and the Challenge Yves du Manoir. But low gates, an already crammed schedule doomed it after three seasons.\nA final effort to resurrect it was made in 1996, when it was merged with the Challenge Yves du Manoir, which was called \"Trophée Du-Manoir Coupe de France\". It lasted until 2003 under three different names. As a result, the final seven competitions are counted both in the Coupe de France and Challenge Du Manoir records."

The team also won a U.17 national championship in 2006–2007 in an intense final played against Petrarca Padova. In 2011 the Club won the fourth national championship, this time in the U.16 category, beating Rugby Rovigo.\n1998 is the year in which the Club moves to its own establishment in Via Flaminia and inaugurates the seniores team, mainly composed of friends and newcomers. Capitolina, captained by Stefano Montalto and coached by Luca Santaroni, starts from the serie C2 and manages to immediately obtain the promotion to serie C1, beating all the teams in their league.\nThe year after another coach joins Santaroni: Marco Iscaro, and together the two coaches manage to bring the team to the serie B, after solely two years from the team's existence.\nIn the 2005/6 season Capitolina was promoted to Italy's highest rugby league, the Super 10, with a perfect winning record of 22 wins and a total of 110 points. They won the playoffs against city rivals Rugby Roma with a 20–9 victory to reach the top Italian rugby league after only ten years of existence.\nCapitolina had been striving to deliver better results both in the national league and in the various European trophies that were available. Although with limited success, key investments in infrastructure and players started to have an impact.\nAt the end of the 2008/2009 season the Board decided not to proceed with the existing formula of \"professional\" rugby and withdrew the First XV from the top Italian Championship, thus granting a place in the Super 10 to L'Aquila Rugby.\nThe First XV activities were brought forward by a 4th division team composed only of Members of the club, the former \"ControProgetto\".\nHonours.\nChampions: 2006, 2013\nRunner Up: 2004\nChampions: 2007\nChampions: 2003, 2008\nChampions: 2011"

It ran from 6–14 January 2007.\nAhead of the tournament, the BDO announced a new stage set and player walk-on area. The markers – the two officials who manually calculated player scores – were replaced by on-stage plasma television screens. Thus, the only official on stage was the referee/caller.\nThe defending champion, Jelle Klaasen, who was unseeded after a poor season, lost in straight sets in the first round to fellow Dutchman Co Stompé. This was the first Lakeside tournament since 1994 without four-time winner Raymond van Barneveld, who had switched to the rival Professional Darts Corporation soon after losing to Klaasen in the previous year's BDO final, the first time that a finalist from one World Championship had played in the other World Championship the following year, in direct contravention of the 1997 Tomlin Order. The day after the final, Klaasen himself also defected to the PDC, along with two other Dutch players, Michael van Gerwen and Vincent van der Voort (both of whom had also lost in the first round). \nMartin Adams, the number 1 seed and long known as the nearly man at the Lakeside, as the 2005 losing finalist and a three-time beaten semi-finalist, won the title. Phill Nixon, an unfancied qualifier and 150–1 outsider, also progressed to the final. Adams led 6–0 in the best-of-13-sets final, only for Nixon to mount a comeback and level the match at 6–6, before Adams finally won the deciding set.\nIn the women's tournament, Trina Gulliver maintained her unbeaten record as she won her seventh successive final. However, she needed a sudden-death leg to defeat Francis Hoenselaar. This was the fourth time in succession, and fifth overall, that Hoenselaar had lost in the final.\nPre-Tournament Odds.\nThe odds before the tournament began (supplied by official on-site bookmakers, Coral) \nSeeds.\nMen\nWomen\nPrize money.\nThe prize money was £224,000 for the men's event and £11,000 for the women's event.\nThere was also a shared 9 Dart Checkout prize of £52,000, along with a High Checkout prize of £2,000 per event.\nTelevision coverage.\nThe tournament was covered by the BBC in the UK and SBS 6 in the Netherlands. Eurosport also broadcast the event on a pan-European basis, but the contract excluded them from showing the tournament to UK viewers.\nThe viewing figures for the final in the UK were 3.3 million (0.32 million down on 2006). The Dutch audience for the final was 1,201,000.\nTournament Review.\nDay One \"Saturday 6 January\"&lt;br&gt;\nJelle Klaasen's defence of his world championship ended in the first round with a defeat by fellow Dutchman, Co Stompé. Klaasen, who had a difficult year since his victory over Raymond van Barneveld in last year's final was ranked lower than his opponent and lost in straight sets. It was the sixth time that a champion failed to win his opening match on the defence of the title. Stompé's victory was his first at Lakeside since 2002 – having lost in the first round at the last five attempts.\nDavy Richardson finally managed to win a match at Lakeside, some fourteen years after his first attempt. He had lost in the first round in 1993 (to Steve Beaton), 1999 (to Co Stompé), 2001 (to Jez Porter), 2002 (to Wayne Mardle) and 2005 (to Martin Adams) but his bad run ended with a victory over number nine seed Vincent van der Voort.\nNo problems for top seed Martin Adams and other seeded players Mervyn King, Ted Hankey and Mike Veitch who all earned places in the second round with straight sets victories.\nDay Two \"Sunday 7 January\"&lt;br&gt;\nThe second day produced a series of shocks as the bookmaker's pre-tournament favourite for the title, Michael van Gerwen lost to Gary Robson. The 17-year-old World Masters champion was 9/4 favourite for the title, but found himself trailing through most of the match. Gerwen shown some signs of the form that took him number three in the world, but his night could be summed up by his start to match. He took the first leg against the darts, then hit three single ones to start the next leg. The inconsistently plagued him throughout the match as did his sponsors logo on his shirt which he had to keep pushing back into place. Robson, winner of the 2005 World Darts Trophy missed darts in the final set to clinch the match but finally hit a double four in the eighth leg to seal the win.\nEarlier in the day the shocks started with Gary Anderson and Darryl Fitton making early exits. Albertino Essers, a Dutchman who had suffered from dartitis in recent years, ended second seed Anderson's hopes with a 3–2 win.\nFitton, who made his trademark entrance dancing to Madness hit One Step Beyond..., took the first set against qualifier Phill Nixon but then lost nine consecutive legs to go down 3–1. Nixon, making his debut in the tournament at the age of 50, hit checkouts of 121 and 110 as he refused to allow the seventh seed any way back into the match.\nTony Eccles, seeded four but a 50/1 outsider for the title beat promising Welshman Mark Webster in straight sets. Webster failed to show the form that took him to a Europe Cup singles title and like van Gerwen earlier in the evening, his Lakeside debut ended in defeat.\nDay Three \"Monday 8 January\"&lt;br&gt;\nDay three's play was overshadowed by the withdrawal from the tournament by 2004 champion Andy Fordham. Fordham, who had had health problems for some time, suffered breathing difficulties as a result of a chest infection and was taken to hospital from the venue. His scheduled opponent, Australia's Simon Whitlock, thus received a walkover into the second round. It was the first time a player had withdrawn from a match since the 1979 World Championship, when Alan Evans pulled out of the third-place play-off, also due to ill health.\nWhen play started, the three seeded players in action all progressed to the last 16, but John Walton and Paul Hanvidge had struggles on their hands, both going through 3–2. Walton, the 2001 champion, was taken to a tie-break in the final set by Brian Sørensen, before finally winning 5 legs to 3. Meanwhile, an emotional Hanvidge defeated his good friend, Martin Phillips, and then dedicated the victory to his mother, who had died on Christmas Day.\nDay Four \"Tuesday 9 January\"&lt;br&gt;\nThe second round of the tournament got underway with the first four matches from the top half of the draw. This half had seen few shocks in terms of the seedings, with only the number 9 seed, Vincent van der Voort, losing in the first round. The trend continued in the second round as Martin Adams (seeded 1), Tony Eccles (4), Mervyn King (5) and Ted Hankey (8) all made it to the quarter-finals. Out of the four, Hankey had the most difficulty in progressing: he was 2–0 and 3–2 down against Davy Richardson, before a maximum 170 checkout at the start of the final set finally swung the match in his favour. Richardson had been battling the pain of broken ribs in the tournament.\nKing's opponent, Mike Veitch, complained that he had been put off by King shouting whilst he retrieved his darts from the board. Nonetheless, King secured a quarter-final meeting with Eccles, while Hankey set up a clash with Adams.\nDay Five \"Wednesday 10 January\"&lt;br&gt;\nUnseeded Gary Robson came from 3–1 behind to defeat 2001 champion John Walton and reach the quarter-finals. This guaranteed a first-time finalist from the bottom half of the draw. His opponent would be Dutchman Niels de Ruiter, who also needed a deciding set to beat number 6 seed Simon Whitlock.\nPhill Nixon, a first-time qualifier at the age of 50, followed up his victory over number 7 seed Darryl Fitton with a 4–1 win against number 10 seed Martin Atkins. This set up a quarter-final with number 15 seed Paul Hanvidge, who beat Albertino Essers 4–1.\nDay Six \"Thursday 11 January\"&lt;br&gt;\nDay six saw the first two quarter-finals settled, as top seed Martin Adams saw off 2000 champion Ted Hankey 5–3 while Mervyn King beat Tony Eccles 5–4. King hit ten 180s in his match while coming from 3–0 behind, before revealing in his post-match interview that he had nearly walked out of the tournament in response to speculation about a possible switch to the PDC. He said, \"I nearly packed my darts away and went home. You nearly didn't have a quarter-final. It was that close.\"\nMeanwhile, Adams took the first two sets, before Hankey levelled at 2–2 and 3–3. \"The Count\" then narrowly missed a 138 checkout which would have given him the seventh set, and Adams responded by taking that set and breaking the throw in the eighth. He then missed seven darts for victory, before finally sealing it with a double five. By coincidence, Adams had beaten Hankey by the same scoreline at the same stage two years previously.\nDay Seven \"Friday 12 January\"&lt;br&gt;\nThe semi-final line-up was completed with the conclusion of the quarter-finals. Both games went to the final set with Niels de Ruiter maintaining the Dutch interest in the event, defeating Gary Robson. Robson took the first two sets, then de Ruiter hit two 13, one 14 and one 15 dart leg in his comeback to level.\nThe deciding leg of the fifth set was amongst the highest standard leg in the history of the Lakeside event. Robson opened with 140, then de Ruiter hit his 5th 180 of the match. Robson's 140 was followed with another 180 leaving a nine-dart opportunity. Robson's ton left 121 and when de Ruiter missed the nine-darter and left himself on 36 for a ten-dart finish, Robson checked out the 121 to go 3–2 up in sets. He took the next set as well but de Ruiter battled back again to level. Robson hit a bullseye and a double 16 to save the match twice in the final set but de Ruiter's sixth dart for the match (at double 18) secured the win.\nPhill Nixon, the 150–1 outsider at the start of the tournament, progressed to the semi-final with a narrow 5–4 win over Scotland's Paul Hanvidge. Nixon looked to be coasting to the last four when he led 4–1 but then missed six darts for the match and allowed Hanvidge the chance to get back into it. Nixon hit a 105 finish in the fourth leg of the final set to finally close out the match.\nThe Women's final followed and despite dropping her first set at Lakeside since the quarter-finals in 2003, Trina Gulliver went on to clinch her seventh successive title and maintain her unbeaten run in the event. Francis Hoenselaar pushed her all the way, and the match went to a sudden-death fifth leg in the final set. Gulliver won the throw for the bull to start the final leg and a 100, 140, 140 start left her in a commanding position to seal the match. She clinched the title with a double 18, her fourth dart for the match.\nDay Eight \"Saturday 13 January\"&lt;br&gt;\nBoth semi-finals were played in their traditional Saturday afternoon timeslot and the first match was between number one seed Martin Adams and number five seed Mervyn King. Adams looked to be coasting towards the final when he took a 5–2 set lead, but then King began to fightback with one 12-darter and three 13-darters. When King took six consecutive legs to level the match it looked like Adams had blown his chance to reach the final, just as he'd blown a lead in the final of the World Masters in October. This time he held his nerve by taking all three legs in the deciding set to reach his second world final.\nThe second semi-final saw Dutchman Niels de Ruiter against the surprise package of the tournament Phill Nixon. Nixon won the first three sets before de Ruiter took the fourth. But Nixon continued his great run and went 5–1 up. De Ruiter then produced a fightback to take the 7th, 8th and 9th sets to trail 4–5. Nixon regained his composure in the 10th set and hit his 14th and 15th 180s during the set to close out the match and reach the final.\nDay Nine \"Sunday 14 January\"&lt;br&gt;\nIt was a memorable final with two 50-year-old players battling it out for their first world title. Adams was the strong favourite, having been the number one seed. Nixon was the 150–1 outsider at the start of the event but had beaten a seeded player in each round on the way to the final.\nAdams looked like he was going to walk away with an easy victory when he went into the break having taken the first six sets and needing just one to win. Adams then threw for the match at 2–1 in the seventh set. Nixon had other ideas and started to claw his way back into it. Adams missed four darts that could have won him the match and started to look more worried until eventually Nixon drew level.\nNixon threw first in the deciding set and began with a 180, but Adams took the leg out in 12 darts after Nixon narrowly missed a 122 checkout. Adams then held his own throw to once again go within a leg of the title. Nixon once again narrowly missed a chance to hold his throw, this time with double-18 for a 110 checkout, and Adams finished 54 on double 20 to win his first World Championship at the fourteenth time of asking.\nQualifiers.\nOn 2 October, the BDO announced that the 2007 Championships would contain 16 seeded players for the first time since 1981. Two days later they announced that the top 26 players from the Invitational table would also qualify automatically. Defending champion Jelle Klaasen had slipped to 19 in the rankings at the time the seedings were announced, and has therefore missed out on being seeded. He was drawn against Co Stompé in the first round.\nThe qualifying event was held at Bridlington on Thursday 12 October, the day before the Winmau World Masters event. From a field of 239 players playing the best of 3 sets, four players emerged as qualifiers for the 2007 World Finals.\nFormer champion, Tony David was defeated by Kierion Carter of Wales in the first qualifying round. Despite a run of four victories Bobby George (WDF Ranking 165) fell two rounds short of qualification for the finals.\nThe eventual qualifiers from the event were:\nThe final place at Lakeside was reserved for the winner of the World Masters – but as Michael van Gerwen had already booked a place it was taken by Gary Fenn, who had won a stand-by play-off a few days earlier. Ironically, if Fenn was to progress to the second round he could come up against Phill Nixon – the man who had already \"knocked him out\" of the qualifying event for the World Championship on 12 October.\nThe draw for the event was made at Leisure World, Bridlington on 13 October 2006 at 10am by the owners of the Lakeside – Bob Potter and Barbara Leitch."

        "text": "The 2007 Ladbrokes.com World Darts Championship was the 14th World Championship organised by the Professional Darts Corporation since it separated from the British Darts Organisation. The tournament took place between 18 December 2006 – 1 January 2007. The championship was once again held at the Circus Tavern in Purfleet, Essex, where it had been staged since the first PDC World Championship in 1994. However, it would turn out to be the last time the tournament would be held at the Tavern: in April 2007, the PDC announced that the event would be moving to Alexandra Palace from 2008.\nThis was the fifth year of Ladbrokes' sponsorship deal, with the tournament prize fund now at a record £500,000. The PDC had introduced a bonus for a nine-dart finish at the 2006 World Matchplay, which started at £5,000 and rolled over to the next Premier tour event if not won; for this tournament, the bonus stood at £15,000, as a nine-darter had not been achieved at the Matchplay or the World Grand Prix. The bonus was not won, so it rolled over again, to the 2007 UK Open.\nRaymond van Barneveld became the first player in the history of the sport to play in the BDO World Championship final and the PDC World Championship final in consecutive years, having decided to switch organisations on 15 February 2006. Barneveld was close to defeat against top seed Colin Lloyd in the second round, but then never dropped another set on his way to the final, which was much anticipated between the best players of the current era. Barneveld and Phil Taylor had 17 World Championships between them and in one of the greatest matches in darts history, Barneveld came back from 3–0 down in sets to win 7–6 after a sudden-death leg. It was Barneveld's fifth world title overall.\nTaylor maintained his record of reaching every single PDC World Championship final to date, but the defeat ended a 21-match unbeaten run at the Tavern, as well as his three-year reign as World Champion.\nQualifiers.\nIn addition to the top 32 ranked PDC players, 32 places were awarded to qualifiers. 16 players progressed from a Professional Dart Players Association (PDPA) qualifying event and 16 qualifiers were determined by the PDC in consultation with the PDPA. This involved various qualifying tournaments across the world in territories where television coverage of the PDC is broadcast, plus some wildcards awarded by international broadcasters and the PDC.\nThe full list of the 16 players who made it to the Circus Tavern as an International Qualifier are:\nMitchell Clegg, from New South Wales, Australia was the youngest ever qualifier for a World Darts Championship (BDO or PDC). In October 2006, he won the Oceanic Masters at the age of 15 to earn a place at the Circus Tavern in January. He celebrated his 16th birthday in November 2006. He lost to eventual champion Raymond van Barneveld in the 1st round – ironically both players were making their Circus Tavern debuts despite their vastly different levels of experience.\nIt is the only World Darts Championship to date (PDC, BDO or WDF) to not have a qualifier from Scotland.\nPDPA Qualifying tournament.\n172 players lined up at the Holte Suite, Villa Park, Birmingham for the qualifiers for the World Championship on 2 December 2006. They included four former World Champions, Eric Bristow, John Lowe, Richie Burnett and Keith Deller. Former World Matchplay winners Peter Evison and Rod Harrington also attempted to qualify alongside two-time World Grand Prix finalist Shayne Burgess and former World finalist, Dave Whitcombe\nThey were all faced with a minimum of three matches (4 for Evison and Burnett) to qualify. Harrington and Evison both went at the first hurdle. Bristow, Lowe and Deller all managed to win their first matches, but then all fell in their second games (Lowe 4–5 to Ian Branks, Bristow 0–5 to Dennis Smith and Deller 4–5 to Dave Ladley). Burgess and Whitcombe also fell two matches short of qualification.\nRichie Burnett managed to win four qualifying rounds to qualify for the first round proper at the Circus Tavern. He was joined by Alan Green, Alan Tabern, Steve Smith, Wayne Atwood, Ian Branks, Adrian Gray, Martin Burchell, Colin Osborne, Darren Webster, Alan Caves, Dave Ladley, Gary Welding, Dave Jowett, Mick McGowan and Mark Lawrence.\nThe draw for the Ladbrokes World Championship was made after the qualifiers were completed.\nPrize money.\nThe total prize fund for the 2007 World Championship was £500,000.\nRepresentation from different countries.\nThis table shows the number of players by country in the World Championship.\nTelevision coverage.\nThe following television stations broadcast the 2007 PDC World Championships.\nThe UK television ratings for the World Championship included the following highlights\nThe viewing figures for the final were 1,028,000. The Newcastle United v Manchester United game which immediately preceded the darts on Sky Sports 1 achieved viewing figures of 1,761,000 – (also known as the \"lead-in\" audience for the darts).\nDutch television audience\nTournament review.\nPhil Taylor opened the defence of his title with a comfortable 3–0 victory over Austrian qualifier Anton Pein, without dropping a single leg during the match and only allowing Pein three darts on a double in the final leg of the final set. Number seven seed Peter Manley also had little trouble in despatching Dave Jowett with the loss of only one leg.\nThe big upset came when Ronnie Baxter, twice a finalist in the BDO World Championship went out in the first round for the second year running. He lost 2–3 to 25-year-old Sussex player, Adrian Gray who was never behind in the entire match.\nFormer World Champion John Part struggled through to the second round against Merseyside debutant Alan Green 3–2, when the final set went right down to the wire. The Canadian only just avoided going down to a tie-break leg clinching the final set 6 legs to 4. Wynand Havenga, the first ever South African at the PDC World Darts Championship reached the second round by eliminating 26th seed Steve Maish.\nElsewhere, 6th seed Terry Jenkins dispatched Mark Lawrence 3–1, Mick McGowan defeated 31st seed Matt Clark who produced the highest checkout of the tournament thus far with a 161 finish, and Chris Mason cruised through against Wayne Atwood 3–0.\nThe afternoon session provided a series of shocks as three of the four seeded players in action were toppled. Bob Anderson lost to 38-year-old Darren Webster, from Norfolk 1–3. Anderson was always in trouble, having dropped the first five legs of the match. The Limestone Cowboy had been struggling with a trapped nerve in his neck, but battled back to win the third set, but Webster closed out the match with two 14-dart legs.\nCanadian debutant, Bryan Cyr put out Barrie Bates, who had been an in-form player in 2006. Cyr took the first two sets before Bates fought back to level, but Cyr was strongest on the doubles to clinch the final set. Dutch teenager, Rico Vonck had earlier defeated world number 16 Mark Walsh, who it seemed may be struggling with dartitis.\nThe evening session went more in favour of the seeds as world number 1, Colin Lloyd defeated Tomas Seyler, who missed ten darts to win the first set. Lloyd then went on to win the match comfortably. Raymond van Barneveld's debut match at the PDC World Championship was a successful one, beating 16-year-old Australian qualifier Mitchell Clegg 3–0. The 5th seed Adrian Lewis whitewashed the other Australian qualifier Anthony Fleet, who failed to win a single leg, and 9th seed Denis Ovens dropped only two legs in a 3–0 defeat of Steve Smith. Alan Warriner-Little was another seeded casualty, however, managing to win only one leg in his defeat by Alan Tabern.\nWayne Mardle became the highest seeded player to be toppled so far in the first round when he was knocked out by Alan Caves. Caves stormed into a two-set lead before Mardle started to show any signs of the form that took him to number eight in the world. Mardle pulled back to level the match and even missed two darts at his favourite double 18, and a further three at double 20 to win the match. Caves, who had never won a match on television held his nerve in the final set to win it 5 legs to 3.\nEarlier in the afternoon session, the seeds continued to tumble as both Colin Monk and Lionel Sams suffered first round exits at the hands of Denmark's Per Laursen and Scunthorpe's Dave Ladley respectively. Last year's semi-finalist Wayne Jones defeated Ian Branks 3–0, and Andy Hamilton beat off Gary Welding, the man who knocked out world number 1 Colin Lloyd in the first round last year.\nIn the evening session, 1996 BDO World Champion Steve Beaton was untroubled as he beat Canadian Gerry Convery without dropping a single leg. In-form third seed Dennis Priestley beat Josephus Schenk in straight sets, and rising star James Wade defeated his opponent Warren French 3–1.\nThe first round came to an end with seven out of the eight seeded players in action progressing through to the last 32. The only seed to miss out was 2004 finalist, Kevin Painter who was beaten by Colin Osborne despite an average of 89.96. Osborne notched the tournament's first ten-dart finish and hit seven 180s during the win.\nDuring the afternoon session, ill 25th seed Dave Askew beat off Martin Burchell 3–2, and 'The Pieman' and 21st seed Andy Smith cruised through in straight sets against China's Shi Yongsheng. 20th seed Wes Newton booked a second round clash with Colin Osborne with a convincing whitewash victory against Japan's Tetsuya Wada, and 12th seed Andy Jenkins won 3–1 against American Bill Davis, dedicating his victory to his late father Chris.\nThe opening match of the evening session saw 14th seed Mark Dudbridge take out top-rated American John Kuczynski 3–1, and 4th seed 'Tripod' Roland Scholten dropped only one leg in his defeat of Ron Miller. In the last match of the night and the first round, former BDO World Champion Richie Burnett, who had to qualify this year, managed to win only one leg against Alex Roy.\nWhen the draw was made there was much anticipation for a possible clash between world number one, Colin Lloyd and four-time BDO World Champion, Raymond van Barneveld. They produced a dramatic match which went right down to a tie-break leg in the final set. Lloyd had opened a 3–0 set lead and looked to be on the way to victory, but missed the bullseye which would have given him a 4–1 victory. Lloyd missed another bullseye in the sixth set for the match and Barneveld took it the final set. Even in the deciding set Lloyd missed more chances to go through missing double top in eighth and tenth legs. The match went to a sudden-death 11th leg after they couldn't be separated at 5 legs all. Barneveld took advantage of throwing first to win the leg in 15 darts. After the match in an exclusive interview, Barneveld revealed that the recollection of an inspiring meeting with an exceptional fan by the name of Alex Schoelcher back in the Netherlands at the cinema, was what kept him going despite being 3–0 down. He said the striking words said to him by this particular fan fuelled his drive to win. What was said exactly remains unknown, one of the great mysteries in the darts world today.\nThe hype surrounding the Lloyd-Barneveld match perhaps overshadowed some other great matches on the final day before the tournament's break for Christmas. Peter Manley, a three-time Purfleet finalist came back from 0–3 to level his match but then lost the final set in a major upset against South African qualifier, Wynand Havenga. Terry Jenkins and Adrian Lewis had narrow 4–3 victories over former world champion Steve Beaton and last year's semi-finalist Wayne Jones respectively, while Chris Mason avenged his defeat from last year by John Part, beating the two-time World Champion 4–2.\nOther matches included Dutch youngster Rico Vonck beating Canadian Brian Cyr 4–2 to set up a third round match with fellow countryman Barneveld, and the final match of the evening that went on until over midnight resulted in Darren Webster beating Adrian Gray 4–1 in a fairly lackluster match.\nPlay resumed after the Christmas break on Boxing Day evening with four second-round matches. Phil Taylor was forced to produce some of his best darts to beat Mick Mcgowan. In a high standard match, both players averaged over 100 – which was the first time its happened at this year's championship. McGowan won the first set and hit ten 180s in the match, including two legs where he opened with back-to-back maxima. Taylor produced a sensational average of 109 to win 4–1, which possibly didn't reflect the closeness of the match. Based on his average, McGowan would have beaten most if not all other players if he had faced them, but was unlucky to come up against Taylor.\nEarlier in the evening, 9th seed Denis Ovens missed a dart at double twelve as Purfleet's first-ever nine-dart finish remained elusive. His match against Alan Tabern went down to a sudden death 11th leg in the final set, which Tabern won. There were 24 maximum 180s in the match between Andy Hamilton and Mark Dudbridge, the 2005 finalist. Dudbridge came back from 1–3 to pull level, but Hamilton produced 11 and 13 dart legs in the final set to win the match 4–3. In the final match of the night, Dave Askew shot to a 3–0 lead over Alan Caves, who had beaten Wayne Mardle in the first round. Caves pulled the score back to 3–2 but Askew edged him out in the next set to secure a 4–2 win.\nThe last day of the second round opened with 11th seed James Wade beating 159th-ranked qualifier Dave Ladley. Wade led early on 2–1 and looked quite comfortable until Ladley took the lead by winning the next two sets (the last leg of which was won with a 156 finish). However Wade managed to dig deep and took the next set before winning by two clear legs 4–2 in the decider to go through 4–3. Another shock almost took place as third seed Dennis Priestley fell behind 0–2 to Dane, Per Laursen – who was also 3–1 up before Priestley produced an inspired comeback (despite Laursen having eight darts to win the match in the sixth set) to win 4–3. In the final match of the afternoon rising star Colin Osborne, who had beaten Kevin Painter in the first round, defeated 20th seed Wes Newton 4–2. Andy Jenkins opened the evening session by reaching the last 16 for the first time beating Andy Smith 4–2. The final second round game became the third match of the tournament to go down to a sudden-death 11th leg in the final set as Roland Scholten beat Alex Roy, despite trailing 2–3 in sets at one stage.\nThe third round got underway and Raymond van Barneveld had no trouble in dispatching fellow countryman, Rico Vonck. In complete contrast to his classic with Colin Lloyd, van Barneveld won all 12 legs for a whitewash 4–0 win. Barneveld averaged 102.48, which was his second highest average in a world championship match. His opponent in the quarter-finals will be unseeded Alan Tabern who beat Dave Askew 4–3 in the final match of the night.\nSouth African Wynand Havenga's Purfleet adventure was brought to an end by 38-year-old Norwich qualifier, Darren Webster by 4 sets to 2. Havenga had knocked out Peter Manley in the second round, but found himself two sets behind before fighting back to level. Webster took three legs in a row to take the fifth set and dropped only one leg in the sixth set for the win.\nNumber four seed, Roland Scholten was toppled by another qualifier Colin Osborne. Osborne became the third player who made it through from the PDPA qualifying to reach the last eight and Scholten's surprise defeat left Raymond van Barneveld as the only non-English player left in the championship. The fifth seed Adrian Lewis was also defeated 4–3 by twelfth seed Andy Jenkins in a high-standard match, where at one point Jenkins had a 67% success rate in hitting checkout doubles.\nIn the evening, number six seed Terry Jenkins joined his namesake Andy in the quarter-finals by coming from 3–1 down to win 4–3 over eleventh seed James Wade, and the last match of the third round saw number three seed Dennis Priestley go down to nineteenth seed Andy Hamilton 4–1.\nHowever, the main controversy of the night came as Phil Taylor faced Chris Mason. Before the match, the tabloids had hyped comments made by Mason about Taylor's supposed boasting and arrogance. As the match began the two barely made eye contact, Taylor seeming unperturbed as he came to a 4–0 win over Mason. At the end of the match Mason exchanged words with Taylor, who claimed Mason swore at him and he threatened to not continue playing if he kept on getting comments of that sort (Taylor is often a victim of criticism by many players). Despite this he played against Darren Webster in the quarter-finals and most, if not all of the hype surrounding the incident has now calmed down.\nThe tournament reached the quarter-final stage and the closest of the matches came in the afternoon session. Both games went to a deciding ninth set, first Andy Jenkins came from 1–3 and 3–4 behind to beat impressive qualifier Colin Osborne. Andy Hamilton went through to the semi-final hitting sixteen 180s against Terry Jenkins, who hit ten himself. Jenkins had fought back from 0–3 behind, but his comeback was in vain as Hamilton edged another thrilling match.\nThe prospect of a Taylor v Barneveld final came ever closer as both players won their evening quarter-finals comfortably. Barneveld beat Alan Tabern 5–0, dropping only four legs in the match. Taylor also lost only four legs, but Darren Webster strung together three successive legs to clinch a consolation fifth set. Webster also hit the highest checkout of the tournament so far of 164, but despite an average of 95, the Norwich player lost 1–5 to the defending champion.\nBoth semi-finals ended with whitewashes as Raymond van Barneveld and Phil Taylor progressed to the final. Barneveld's semi-final against Andy Jenkins was the first match of the evening, and the Dutchman lost only four legs during the match. Jenkins only resilience came in the third set when he had two darts at double top to narrow the gap to 1–2, but he missed and Barneveld stepped in and then also took the next six legs to go 5–0 up. Jenkins said after the match, \"After what I've been through in the last month, with my dad dying, I'm very happy to have reached the semi-finals.\"\nPhil Taylor raced to a two-set lead against Andy Hamilton, winning the first six legs of the match. The third and fourth sets were much closer, both going to the deciding leg – but Taylor was the stronger in both with an 11-dart leg to win the third and added two more 11-darters in the fifth set. The defending champion lost only six legs in the match to set up a much anticipated final against Barneveld.\nThe final that had been much anticipated brought 13-time and defending champion, Phil Taylor against 4-time BDO World Champion, Raymond van Barneveld. The match more than lived up to the hype, as Taylor won the first eight legs of the match to lead 2–0 in sets and legs. Barneveld only had one dart at a double in that time, a missed bullseye for a 167 finish.\nBarneveld hit a 14-dart finish to win the ninth leg of the match his first, but Taylor closed out the set to lead 3–0. Barneveld then started to turn the match around by winning all three legs in the fourth set, closing it out with the tournament's highest three-dart checkout, the maximum 170. He came from 2–1 down to win the fifth set in a decider and was now only one set behind.\nTaylor took the sixth set, then Barneveld took the seventh to stay just one behind at 3–4. Taylor edged the next to lead 5–3, but the game then started to turn in Barneveld's favour as he won six out of the next seven legs to draw level for the first time since the start of the match, then won the 11th set from 2–0 down in legs to lead the match for the first time. The 12th set also went to a deciding leg, this time with Taylor winning comprehensibly to set up a deciding set in the final of the PDC World Championship for the third time in five years.\nBarneveld 100, Taylor 180; B 180, T 40; B 105, T 133; B 76, T 58. Barneveld, now requiring double top with Taylor back on 90, hit the match winning dart with his first dart to take the leg and the title."

The tournament was organised by the British Darts Organisation (BDO).\nFollowing the 1988 Winmau World Masters ITV pulled all their coverage of darts and the BBC decided to withdraw their coverage of the 1988 British Professional Championship, meaning that this World Championship was the only televised darts tournament in 1989. The World Championship would remain the only annual televised event for the next four years.\nIn an attempt to improve the image of the game (which contributed to the loss of television coverage and sponsors), the BDO decided that players would no longer be allowed to drink alcohol during matches - allowing just water on the stage.\nThe tournament itself saw old rivals Jocky Wilson and Eric Bristow meet in the final after Wilson had beaten defending champion Bob Anderson and Bristow had seen off John Lowe in the semi-finals. Wilson raced into a five sets to nil lead, but Bristow took the next four sets to set up a tense finish - until, after missing several double attempts, Wilson finally took the title 6–4.\nPrize money.\nThe prize fund was £84,800.\nThere was also a 9 Dart Checkout prize of £52,000, along with a High Checkout prize of £1,000."

In 1994 following a breakaway the PDC staged its own World Championship for the first time.\nIn 1989, the Embassy World Championship was the only darts tournament which had received television coverage, and a group of 16 players (including all but one of the previous World Champions) wanted to appoint a PR consultant to improve the image of the game. They created the World Darts Council (WDC), later the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) in late January 1992, soon after a controversial VHS release of the 1992 Embassy World Final between Phil Taylor and Mike Gregory.\nBy the time of the 1993 Embassy World Championship, the WDC had already held their own tournament, the 1992 Lada UK Masters (won by Mike Gregory) in October 1992. The tournament had been broadcast on Anglia Television, and the WDC players wanted to see their exposure to television coverage increase.\nDuring the 1993 Embassy World Championship, the WDC players wore their new insignia on their sleeves. They were soon told to remove them by the tournament organisers, the BDO. The WDC players decided that if they were not going to be recognised by the BDO they would no longer play in the Embassy Championships.\nDuring the tournament, the 16 WDC players released a statement saying that they would only play in the 1994 Embassy World Championship if it came under the auspices of the WDC, and that they only recognised the WDC as having the authority to sanction their participation in darts tournaments worldwide. Despite this statement, the BDO held firm and the WDC players instead held their own 1994 World Championship, now known as the Split in darts.\nThe second round saw several upset results including defeats of three former World Champions. Eric Bristow lost to Bob Anderson, while defending champion Phil Taylor lost to Kevin Spiolek. Dennis Priestley, the number one seed and tournament favourite, lost to Steve Beaton, despite Priestley having thrown a record average of 102.63 against Jocky Wilson in the first round. Other notable upsets during the tournament were Kevin Spiolek beating Kevin Kenny in the first round, Wayne Weening beating Rod Harrington in the first round, and Bobby George beating Mike Gregory in the quarter-finals.\nJohn Lowe went on to beat Alan Warriner in a low-quality final and claim this last unified world title in the sports of darts - the third world title of Lowe's career. With his previous victories in 1979 and 1987, he became the first player to win the World title in three different decades.\nThis was Raymond van Barneveld's second world championship appearance (debut 1991), and he landed the highest checkout of the tournament, 170.\nPrize money.\nTotal Prize fund was £128,500 (plus a £51,000 bonus for a nine-dart finish - not won)"

        "text": "Harlow Rugby Club is a rugby union club based in Harlow, Essex, England.\nHarlow Rugby Club currently fields a senior team, plus a fairly vibrant ladies team. The first XV currently compete in London 3 Essex - a league at tier 8 of the English rugby union system - following their relegation from London 2 North East at the end of the 2018–19 season, whilst the Rams (2nd XV) and Saints (3rd XV) compete in the Essex Shepherds Neame Clubs Leagues.\nClub history.\nThe club came into existence on December 8, 1955 at a meeting in the Essex Skipper pub in Harlow. Founder members included; Alexander J McCowan, Dr John Huntley, Ron Bracewell, Ron Strudwick, Ron Parkin, Derek Jennings and Eric Jones.\nHarlow initially played in a white and green striped strip. The New Town Development Corporation provided grounds for the club at a token rent of £15 per annum. This ground wasn't usable to begin with so the club played rugby on a local farmer's field for the interim.\nThe Ram Gorse Club House was opened by Sir Richard Costain in 1959. Over the years, membership grew as Harlow attracted members from all over the UK, and especially from Wales. Harlow fielded more and more teams on match days. During the 1980/81 season Harlow were able to field seven different teams on a Saturday. During these years one of Harlow's cornerstone teams was the Saints. The Saints have had two unbeaten seasons during their time, 1975/76 and 1982/83.\nHarlow's strength in depth continued over several decades after Gwynne Harris, the PE Advisor for West Essex Education Authority, for a number of years encouraged many high quality P.E. teachers from the Cardiff and other Welsh colleges to transfer their rugby skills and enhance their educational careers in the town and from this environment promising students were encouraged to join the club; the club built one of the highest quality junior rugby set-ups in the UK.\nWhen leagues were formed in 1987/88, Harlow were placed in the Eastern Counties Division One. Thereafter, they were promoted every two years until finally reaching the London Division One in 1993. Harlow have never won the Essex Cup, however, Harlow has won the Eastern Counties Cup twice; first, in 1995 and second, in 1997; in 1999 a Harlow Sevens squad reached the Middlesex 7s finals and played on the hallowed turf at Twickenham Stadium beating Richmond in their last tournament as a professional club.\nIn July 2017 the club completed a move to a facility in the centre of Harlow named Latton Park.\nColts rugby.\nHarlow Colts won 100 matches in a row from 1979 to 1981. Wasps, Saracens, Leicester, and Bristol were first-class teams Harlow Colts played. During this period, a number of Harlow players - Dave Hurley, Jonathan Locke and Wayne Kearns, were selected to play first-class rugby for Saracens and London Irish. Jonathan Locke and Wayne Kearns achieved junior international honours for England and Ireland U21s respectively. More recently, Harlow junior, Steven Pope, has represented London Wasps, Blackheath R.C., London Welsh and Swansea RFC rugby clubs and he has also represented England Divisions against South Africa."

        "text": "In volleyball, pepper, usually used as a verb, is a very popular warm-up drill, generally involving two players. This drill is used to practice and perfect ball control. It originated from a drill traditionally used in baseball. This drill involved catching and throwing back and forth quickly, similarly to the quick movements of pepper. Variations with more players exist. (Similar to the Law of Hyena)\nTo pepper, two players face each other separated by a distance of 5–20 feet (2–6 meters). Distances vary based upon the players' preference. Player 2 starts by hitting or tossing a volleyball to player 1. Player 1 then passes the ball back to player 2 starting the drill. Player 2 sets the ball back to player 1. Player 1 spikes the ball back, forcing player 2 to dig the ball where player 1 can set it, allowing player 2 to spike it. Player 1 passes the spiked ball, and the cycle starts over again.\nOne full cycle of the drill is laid out in the following table."

Lebanon was represented in these Olympics by a single alpine skier, Ibrahim Geagea. He competed in three events, and his best finish was 57th in the men's downhill competition.\nBackground.\nThe Lebanese Olympic Committee was recognised by the International Olympic Committee on 31 December 1947. They joined Olympic competition less than a month later, participating in the 1948 Winter Olympics. The 1952 Winter Olympics were held in Oslo, Norway from 14 to 25 February 1952; a total of 694 athletes representing 30 National Olympic Committees took part. These Oslo Olympics were therefore Lebanon's second appearance at a Winter Olympic Games. Lebanon sent a single competitor to Oslo, Ibrahim Geagea, who competed in three events in alpine skiing.\nAlpine skiing.\nIbrahim Geagea was 27 years old at the time of the Oslo Olympics, and was making the second of his four consecutive Olympic appearances. On 15 February, he took part in the single-run men's giant slalom race, and finished the course in a time of 3 minutes and 52.8 seconds, which put him in 82nd and last place among those athletes that completed the event. The gold medal was won in 2 minutes and 25 seconds by Stein Eriksen of Norway; the silver and bronze medals were both won by Austrians, Christian Pravda and Toni Spiss respectively.\nThe next day, Geagea participated in another single-run race, the men's downhill. He finished the competition in a time of 3 minutes and 20.2 seconds, which ranked him 57th out of 72 finishing competitors. The gold medal was won in 2 minutes and 30.8 seconds by Zeno Colò of Italy; Austrians again took both the silver and bronze medals, with Othmar Schneider winning the silver and Pravda the bronze. The third and final alpine skiing event for men in Oslo was the slalom, held on 19 February over two legs. Geagea's Olympics were over when he failed to finish the first run. Schneider eventually won the gold medal, with Norwegians Eriksen and Guttorm Berge taking the silver and bronze medals."

        "text": "The University and College Rugby League (UCRL), formerly known as \"the Student Rugby League\", is the organisation which administrates university and college rugby league football in the United Kingdom, on behalf of the Rugby Football League and British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS).\nRugby league in universities has been an important vehicle for expansion of the game as players from outside the heartlands often first began to play at university level. Many continue to play after leaving university and this has led to the creation of teams in non-traditional areas such as London Skolars and the University of Gloucestershire All Golds.\nYorkshire Universities and Colleges played against Lancashire at Halifax's then ground The Shay, Halifax in 1976. The Yorkshire side was selected by Fred Lindop, coach and professional referee and included a number of players from Airedale &amp; Wharfedale College. 22 - 0 down at half time the Yorkshire side fought back to tie the match at 22 - 22.\nHistory.\nFounded in 1967 when a team was created at Leeds University by Andrew Cudbertson, Jack Abernathy and Cec Thompson, other teams soon joined in areas of the United Kingdom which lay outside of the games traditional heartlands. The first university game was between Leeds and Liverpool in 1968. A year later the Universities and Colleges Rugby League was formed after student pioneers fought hard to get the sport recognised in higher education. Portsmouth and Swansea were early non-traditional areas to accept the game.\nRugby League reached Oxford University in 1976 and the first Varsity fixture against Cambridge University took place in 1981. The varsity match has 'discretionary full blue' status.\nStudent Rugby League reached Scotland in 1989 when a group of students at Aberdeen University established a team and formed the first Scotland Students squad\nThe Pioneers were formed in 2005 and made their inaugural tour that year to Estonia. In the following years, development tours visited the Czech Republic, Latvia, Ukraine, Norway, Kazakhstan, Greece, Poland, Morocco and in 2014, to Ghana.\nBy 2006, the Student Rugby League had over 70 member clubs playing in 9 leagues, club locations ranging from Napier in Scotland to Exeter in the South West of England.\nThe elite Premier North &amp; South competition was formed as the Super 6 in 2008.\nIn 2014, the Student Rugby League was renamed the university and College Rugby League (UCRL).\nStudent Rugby League Pyramid.\nThe Premier North &amp; South competition is the elite student league. \nFive matches from the 2011 Super 8 including the inaugural Grand Final were televised live and free-to-view on Premier Sports.

The fixtures run from October until March leading up to the Championship play-off series.\nThe U19's College Competition is split into three leagues, the North West, Yorkshire and the Premier Division. The college leagues play from September until March culminating in a top four play-off series. The Carnegie Champion Colleges is the knock-out competition for the Further Education sector.\nAlongside SRL competitions, the top university sides can qualify for the Challenge Cup.\nPast winners.\n= Northern 2A =\n2023-24 Season*.\nTries: Charlie Rudman (Lancaster University) / Nathan Bannerman (Lancaster University) 7\nConversions: Gabriel Black (Lancaster University) 26\nRepresentative teams.\nIn England, a series of regional games take place which lead to a North and South team being selected to play the University Rugby League Origin Game, from which the England team is selected.\nWales, Scotland and Ireland run national teams.\nAll four teams take part in the 4 Nations Championships that take place annually and the Tertiary Student Rugby League World Cup every four years.

        "title": "2007 State of Origin series",
        "text": "The 2007 State of Origin series was the 26th year that the annual best-of-three series of interstate rugby league football matches between the Queensland and New South Wales representative teams was contested entirely under 'state of origin' selection rules. Queensland won the series by winning the first two games. New South Wales avoided the whitewash by winning the third match held at Suncorp Stadium. The Wally Lewis Medal for player of the series was awarded to Queensland's hooker, Cameron Smith.\nGame I.\nTen thousand tickets to Game I at Suncorp Stadium were sold in seven minutes when they went on sale in March 2007 and all were sold within four hours. Queensland was the bookies' favourites on match day, despite the loss of Carl Webb to a hamstring injury.\nQueensland trailed 6-18 at half-time after a spectacular kick-and-chase solo effort by Jarryd Hayne resulted in a try right on halftime. Queensland recovered after the break with three converted tries including one which followed Darren Lockyer's interception of a wild pass made by Hayne near the New South Wales goal line. Johnathan Thurston later kicked a field goal to put the final score at 25-18. This win saw Queensland claim three consecutive match victories for the first time since 1995's shock whitewash. Thurston was named man-of-the-match. The Blues' Danny Buderus and Kurt Gidley were injured in the match, while Maroons' substitute Antonio Kaufusi suffered a season-ending knee injury in his Origin debut.\nGame II.\nBrett Stewart was called in to make his Origin debut only 24 hours prior to the match as a replacement for the injured Anthony Minichiello. The Maroons went into this match having never won an Origin match at Telstra Stadium in 11 outings. It was also referee Shane Hayne's first State of Origin match.\nThe opening minutes were almost all played in Queensland's half of the field, with the Maroons defending successfully until just before the eight-minute mark when Blues debutant fullback Brett Stewart scored the first points of the match with a close-range try from dummy half. Jamie Lyon's conversion brought the score to 6 - 0 in favour of New South Wales. Queensland then evened up the battle for field position, the game being played almost entirely in the Blues' half from then until the twenty-first minute when the Maroons scored. Their hooker Cameron Smith ran from dummy half on the fifth and last, down the short side and through his tacklers shot a remarkable pass out to the feet of Greg Inglis. Inglis then picked up the ball and crossed out wide (for the fifth time in only three Origin matches) to touch down after improving the field position for his kicker. Johnathan Thurston's conversion was successful so the score was 6 all with three quarters of the match remaining. Queensland dominated field position and crossed the Blues' try line three more times in the remainder of the first half but couldn't score, leaving the sides level at a single converted try each for the break.\nThe first penalty of the match was given after ten minutes of the second half, followed by the second eight minutes after that, providing the Blues with some attacking opportunities which they failed to convert to points. Following the third penalty of the match, which went Queensland's way, they were attacking the New South Wales line and got their second try on the sixty-three-minute mark. A pass (that appeared to be forward but was allowed by the referee) went to Thurston who, keeping the ball alive, chipped a grubbing kick through the line of defence for centre Steven Bell to pick up and dive over the try-line in the corner. The ensuing sideline conversion was missed by Thurston, leaving the score at 10 - 6 in favour of the Maroons. The following ten minutes were a fairly even arm wrestle played mostly in the middle of the field. With under three minutes remaining Brent Kite lost the ball in a tackle and Shaun Berrigan picked it up and ran 45 metres to put it down. However the try was disallowed by the video referee, ruling that Berrigan had also knocked the ball on when he picked it up. The Queenslanders managed to hold out New South Wales' desperate attack to leave the game at 10-6.\nOf the match, Queensland captain Lockyer had this to say: \"In games I've been involved with, that's the gutsiest I've been in.\" It was the first win for Queensland at Telstra Stadium following an 11-game losing streak at the venue, and the first time the Maroons had won four consecutive Origin matches since their 8-game winning streak which lasted from game 2, 1987, to game 3, 1989. Meninga was critical of referee Shayne Hayne's performance in the match with no penalties until the 51st minute and a final count going New South Wales' way 4-1.\nGame III.\nIn the first minute of game III, Dallas Johnson was knocked out cold when attempting a tackle and was assisted from the field. Greg Inglis injured his knee in the 20th minute, and Brent Tate left the field in the 33rd minute, also with a serious knee injury. New South Wales scored the first try in the 21st minute through Jarryd Hayne beating opposition players down the left corner. Queensland responded in the 26th minute with a try scored out wide by Justin Hodges. Thurston failed to convert leaving the score at 6-4 till half time. Queensland were without 3 reserves until Johnson returned early in the second half and played the rest of the game with only two reserves. This forced Queensland forwards such as Steve Price to play the full 80 minutes.\nQueensland held off New South Wales' attacks for most of the second half. Matt Cooper was denied tries twice in the first 10 minutes, once by a last-ditch try-saving tackle by Bell on the try line. It was not till the 73rd minute that New South Wales' Matt King, in his farewell Origin performance having announced his intention to relocate the Super League in 2008, scored a try which was set up by a flat pass from eventual man-of-the-match Greg Bird. Hazem El Masri, in his debut performance for the Blues after an 11-year top-grade career, converted from the sideline, giving New South Wales an important 8-point lead. In the 79th minute, Paul Gallen was able to offload to El Masri on the tryline and the result was sealed. This try also brought New South Wales' points total for the series above that of Queensland.\nJarryd Hayne received the Brad Fittler Medal for New South Wales player of the series. Cameron Smith received the Ron McAuliffe Medal as Queensland's player of the series.\nPlayers.\nNew South Wales.\nThe Bulldogs and Knights contributed the most players, four each, to the total used by New South Wales during the series.\nQueensland.\n2007's defending premiers, the Brisbane Broncos were the most heavily represented club in the Maroons, with eight players."

Wilson also appeared heavily for the United States in the FINA Water Polo World Cup, appearing five total times and finally winning a gold medal at the 1991 FINA Men's Water Polo World Cup, and the FINA World Championships, appearing in 1982, 1986, and 1991.\nOlympic accomplishments.\nWilson's greatest accomplishments came in the Olympics. He was a member of three different teams, ultimately winning two silver medals.\nHis first appearance was in the 1984 Summer Olympics, where the United States ultimately placed second to Yugoslavia despite not losing a match the entire Games. After advancing from group play, it featured a final round where the United States played Yugoslavia in the last match. The teams played to a 5–5 draw, giving each team 5 wins and 1 draw, however with a superior goal differential Yugoslavia emerged victorious.\nIn the 1988 Summer Olympics, Yugoslavia was drawn into the same preliminary group as the United States, with the US claiming a 7–6 victory. Both teams advanced from group play and, in a change from the previous Games, faced off in a championship match. The United States came second best, again, on the wrong side of a 9-7 scoreline. After the renewed heartbreak, Wilson claimed he wouldn't appear in another Olympics and would be retiring.\nDespite not missing a beat, Wilson turned course and decided to appear in the 1992 Summer Olympics. At this stage, he was the oldest men's water polo player at the Games. Despite the United States' past successes, the team failed to medal in 1992 and would mark the last Olympics Wilson would participate in.\nOutlet pass.\nWilson is credited with the introduction of the \"outlet pass\" to water polo. A former Little League pitcher, Wilson was able to move the ball from defense to offense quickly with a long pass to the offensive players from his position in goal. Richard Corso, the former US National Team Goalkeepers Coach who assisted Wilson, noted that, \"We really changed the game in 1980 and '84. Craig's technique as a passer has been copied by everyone. Goalies were looking to get the pass out to start the fast break.\"\nPost-playing career.\nAfter the 1992 Olympics, Wilson joined the private sector and worked in medical device and pharmaceutical sales and for Fortune 500 companies including Bristol-Myers Squibb and AmerisourceBergen.\nHe stayed close to the sport and released \"Guide to Waterpolo goalkeeping\", a short book about techniques for the goalkeeping position.\nHall of Fame recognition.\nWilson is a member of the Class of 1999 USA Water Polo Hall of Fame and was inducted July 17, 1999. Additionally, was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame as a member of the Class of 2005.\nHe's also in the UCSB Gaucho Athletic Hall of Fame twice, being named once individually and once as a member of the 1979 NCAA Championship men's water polo team and is the only player in the history of the UC Santa Barbara men's water polo program to have his cap retired."

Having hit single 17 and then treble 18, Bristow decided against hitting the bullseye. Instead he hit a single 18 to leave double 16, whilst Deller was on 138. Deller had already missed seven darts at a double to win the title in the ninth set, when leading 5-3 and Bristow believed his opponent would not check out the high finish. However, Deller hit treble 20, followed by treble 18 and finally finished on double 12 to win the title. To this day commentators often refer to 138 as the \"Deller checkout\" if a player is left with that score.\nPrize money.\nThe prize fund was £32,300.\nThere was also a 9-Dart Checkout prize of £30,000, along with a High Checkout prize of £750. In the semi-final, Jocky Wilson missed double 18 for the 9-dart finish.\nThe results.\nPreliminary round.\nA best of three sets preliminary round match took place between Alan Evans of Wales and Brent Bartholomew of New Zealand as they were tied on the rankings."

        "title": "1994 BDO World Darts Championship",
        "text": "The 1994 Embassy World Darts Championship was held following two years of controversy within the sport of darts. After the 1993 Championships, several players decided it was time to part company with the British Darts Organisation and form their own organisation, the World Darts Council (now known as the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC)). By the start of this tournament, the WDC were in the closing days of their own 1994 World Championship, with Dennis Priestley going on to beat Phil Taylor in the final.\nPhil Taylor, Dennis Priestley, Rod Harrington, Alan Warriner, Peter Evison, Richie Gardner, Jocky Wilson, Eric Bristow, Keith Deller, John Lowe, Bob Anderson, Cliff Lazarenko, Kevin Spiolek, Jamie Harvey, Mike Gregory and Chris Johns were the players who formed the WDC and therefore did not participate at these 1994 Championships. Mike Gregory and Chris Johns eventually decided to go back to the BDO, but were unable to play in the 1994 BDO World Championship as their change of heart came too late for them to be able to qualify.\nDan Waddell wrote that the tournament \"had the feel of the 1980 Moscow Olympics after the US boycott, or Test cricket during Packer's world series; the best players and most enthralling characters in the game weren't there, so the whole event felt hollow and fraudulent.\" \nOf the 32 players who took part in the 1994 Embassy World Championship, 17 were world championship debutants, with many having never appeared in front of TV cameras before, including the eventual champion, John Part. Of the remaining 15 players in the tournament, only 8 of those had appeared in the 1993 Embassy World Championship, with the other 7 having previously appeared in the Embassy World Championship in years before 1993.\nIn an astonishing first round, 7 out of the 8 seeded players were knocked out, including the new BDO World Number One, Steve Beaton who had risen to the top of the rankings as a result of the defecting players. Only number 3 seed Roland Scholten won his first round match, although he went out in round two.\nAs a result, players previously unheard of had a chance to make a name for themselves and Canada's John Part dropped only one set en route to the Championship. He beat Ronnie Baxter, Paul Lim, Steve McCollum and Ronnie Sharp on the way to final. Part then overwhelmed Bobby George 6-0 in the final.\nGeorge, despite struggling with back problems, had reached his first final in 14 years. His semi-final against Sweden's Magnus Caris saw him comeback from 4 sets to 2 down, winning 9 successive legs to secure his place in the final. In the final, George hit less than 10% of his checkouts (5 from 49 attempts due to the immense pain caused by his broken back which he didn't know was broken at the time. ) and that was the difference as Part became the first player from outside the United Kingdom to win the World Championship. Despite being a surprise winner at the time, Part would also go on to win the PDC's version of the world championship on two occasions.\nFuture three-time winner Martin Adams would also make his debut in this year's tournament. He qualified for the event every year until 2018, meaning he has the record for the BDO World Championship and is behind only Steve Beaton, Phil Taylor and John Lowe for consecutive appearances across both versions of the world championship.\nPrize money.\nThe prize fund was £136,100.\nThere was also a 9 Dart Checkout prize of £52,000, along with a High Checkout prize of £1,500."

        "title": "St Mary's Church, Wimbledon",
        "text": "St Mary's Church, Wimbledon, is a Church of England church and is part of the Parish of Wimbledon, south-west London, England. It has existed since the 12th century and may be the church recorded in the Domesday Book in the Mortlake Hundred. It is still in active use today, and has been grade II* listed since 1949.\nHistory.\nThere have been four churches on the site since 1086:\nThe Victorian Church.\nThe present church dates from 1843, and was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott, then working for the architects 'Messers Scott and Moffat'. Scott was given the brief of building the church without exceeding a strict budget of £4000, which he succeeded in doing by incorporating parts of the earlier building. It is still possible to see these older parts today. Another visibly notable addition was the tower and spire, which is 196 feet tall.\nThe beams in the chancel roof were re-discovered during renovation work of the chancel in 1860. They are thought to be Medieval in origin. The beams are decorated with a chevron and flower pattern and were restored in 1993 as part of the church's 150th anniversary celebrations.\nMemorials.\nThe oldest memorial in the church dates back to 1537; it is in memory of Philip and Margaret Lewston and was commissioned by their daughter Katherine Walter, who has a memorial also within the present church.\nEdward Cecil, 1st Viscount Wimbledon, Lord of the Manor of Wimbledon has his sarcophagus situated within the eponymous side chapel that he had commissioned in the 1620s. The chapel was notably originally lit with six small windows to commemorate his two wives and four daughters. In 1651, Dorothy Cecil left an endowment for the upkeep of her father's tomb, with any surplus to be used for the education and apprenticeship of local children.\nSir Richard Wynn, a 17th-century Member of Parliament, is buried within the nave; he had notably taken care of Wimbledon Manor House for Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I, after she fled to the continent in 1642 during the Civil War.\nSir Theodore Janssen, Lord of the Manor of Wimbledon, who was one of the founders of the Bank of England and director of the ill-fated South Sea Company, is also commemorated.\nTwo more modern brasses commemorate the abolitionist William Wilberton, of the nearby Lauriston House, and Walter Reynolds, who was formerly the rector of the church and, later, the Archbishop of Canterbury.\nThe most recent memorials commemorate Leslie Godfree and Kathleen McKane Godfree who were highly successful tennis players in the early 20th century.\nBurials.\nAt the east end of the churchyard is the large mausoleum of Sir Joseph William Bazalgette, the renowned engineer of the Embankment and the sewer system in London around 1858. There is also a memorial stone to Sir Joseph within the church, while a number of his descendants are in the book of remembrance. In the churchyard are buried the artist Fred Barnard (1846-1896) and the bibliographer and Shakespearian scholar Alfred W Pollard (1859-1944).\nChurch halls.\nFellowship House was built in 1974 and replaced a small room above a shop in Wimbledon Village. It was used for many activities both by the church and outside groups. Today, it is a day nursery during the week and is used by the church at weekends. The Parish Office is located in Fellowship House.\nThe Garden Hall was completed in 2003 due to the need of more space for church activities, especially the growing Sunday School. The building is of modern design, and has won architectural awards. One wall is a large glass window, part of which opens to give access to the grass area outside. It was officially opened on 3 May 2003 by Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy.\nBells.\nSt Mary's has 8 church bells.\nIn 1984, there was a refit of all the 8 bells. The oldest is the original No. 7 dedicated to St. Bartholemew. This bell was made by a London Bell Foundry, circa 1520.\nServices.\nSundays: \nLive Streaming Services.\nSt Mary's has a full streaming system to stream onto both Zoom and YouTube. Every service is streamed apart from the 11:15. A full refit of the streaming system came in January 2022 and has since proven very effective in introducing more members to the church services.\nSt Mary's Church, Wimbledon, in popular culture.\nThe church tower appears in the cover photograph for the 1969 Fairport Convention album \"Unhalfbricking\".\nOther local churches.\n\"See: Parish of Wimbledon\""

        "text": "The Liga Națională de Baschet Masculin (LNBM) () is the top-tier professional basketball league of Romania. The winner of the league each season is crowned the Romanian national champion. Founded in 1950, the league consists of 24 teams playing in three different divisions. Currently, the clubs from the Liga Națională also participate in the European competitions, and can qualify for the Basketball Champions League or the FIBA Europe Cup based on their performance in the national league and cup competition. The most successful club in the league's history is Dinamo București, who has won a record 22 titles. Asesoft Ploieşti won the championship seven times in a row between 2004 and 2010, and again between 2012 and 2014. They became the only Romanian team to win a European title with their success in the FIBA EuroCup Challenge in 2005.\nCompetition format.\nPrior to 2018, the men's Liga Națională had 12 teams who played the season in three rounds. The regular season, which began in October, was considered the first round and was played in a normal round-robin, home-and-away format. At the end of the regular season, the top six clubs played a play-off round, while the bottom six clubs played a play-out round. The six teams in the play-off round and the top two in the play-out round qualified for the play-offs, which were played using a knockout format. Since 2014, the quarter-finals, semi-finals, and finals have been best of five. The bottom two teams in the play-out round are relegated to Liga I.\nIn May 2018, the Romanian Basketball Federation's board of directors decided to entirely reform the system. Liga I was dissolved and the Liga Națională was split into three groups; A, B, and C. Group designation depeneds on performance, financial, and infrastructural criteria. The regular season remains a round-robin in each group. In the second round, the first six teams from Group A are assigned to the Red Group. Teams in 7th and 8th place in Group A, the top three teams from Group B, and the winner of Group C are named the Yellow Group. Teams rank between 4th and 8th place in Group B and the second place team in Group C are assigned to the Blue Group. Those who rank between 3rd and 8th place in Group C are designated as the Green Group.\nIn the second round of the restructured season, teams in the Red Group keep their points while the Yellow, Blue, and Green Groups all begin with zero points. In the third round of the championship, the first two teams from the Yellow Group join the Red Group teams for the play-offs, which use a knockout format. The quarter-finals, semi-finals, and finals continue to be best of five. To determine the teams ranked between 5th and 8th place, the best of three system is used. Remaining teams form two eight-team groups to determine their final rankings.\nNotable Liga Națională players.\nAt least five former Romanian players have been inducted into the European Basketball Hall of Fame."

        "text": "Clifford Rankin \"Pat\" Crawford, a.k.a. \"Captain Pat\", (January 28, 1902 – January 25, 1994) was an American major league baseball player. He graduated from Sumter High School, class of 1919. Crawford graduated from Davidson College, and received his master's degree from The Ohio State University. He played baseball for several semi-pro and minor league teams throughout the 1920s including a stint as the left fielder for the 1922 Kinston Highwaymen in the Eastern Carolina Baseball Association, an independent or \"outlaw league\" team not affiliated with the National Association. Crawford got his big break in 1929 when he made it to the majors with the New York Giants, which were still being managed by the Hall of Famer John McGraw. On May 26, 1929, Crawford hit a pinch-hit grand slam off Socks Seibold in the sixth inning. Les Bell then hit a seventh-inning pinch-hit grand slam off Carl Hubbell. This was the only time in history that two pinch-hit grand slams were hit in the same game. In 1931 and 1932, he had over 237 and 236 hits respectively for minor league Columbus, Ohio. He went in and out of the majors through the 1934 season and was named league MVP of the American Association while playing for the Columbus Senators in 1932. In 1934, Crawford found himself playing on the world champion St. Louis Cardinals. The last two games of his major league career were World Series games. His teammates on the Gashouse Gang that year included HOFers Frankie Frisch, Leo Durocher, Joe Medwick, Dizzy Dean, and Burleigh Grimes. All told, Crawford had a .280 batting average with 9 home runs and 104 RBI in 318 major league games. He was one of the initial inductees in the Kinston Professional Baseball Hall of Fame on February 11, 1983.\nCrawford died on January 25, 1994, in Morehead City, North Carolina, three days shy of what would have been his 92nd birthday. He was the last surviving member of the 1934 World Champion St. Louis Cardinals."

        "text": "Thomas Andrew Irwin (December 20, 1912 – April 25, 1996) was a Major League Baseball player.\nBorn in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Irwin attended the University of North Carolina, where he played on the school's baseball team. After graduating from college, he signed with the Cleveland Indians, and began playing professionally with the New Orleans Pelicans of the Southern Association. He won the starting shortstop job to begin the 1936 season despite not having any professional baseball experience beforehand. Irwin played in 151 games for the Pelicans both in 1937 and 1938, and finished his second season with a .322 batting average.\nEntering the 1938 Cleveland Indians season, Irwin was invited to spring training, and was noted as someone who could win the starting second baseman job. He did not win the job, and was optioned to the Milwaukee Brewers. He played in 125 games on the season, where he had a .296 batting average. At the end of the season, he was promoted to the major league club. He played in the final three games of the season as the team's starting shortstop, and had one hit in nine at-bats.\nOn December 15, 1938, he was traded to the Boston Red Sox with Denny Galehouse for Ben Chapman. As the Red Sox had Hall of Famer Joe Cronin at the shortstop position, the plan was to keep Irwin in Louisville for a season and go from there. He played in 53 games for the Louisville Colonels, then spent part of 1939 and all of 1940 with the Little Rock Travelers, where he had a .256 batting average in 137 games in 1940. After taking the 1941 season off, he spent part of 1942 with Little Rock. Irwin then the Binghamton Triplets, a team in the New York Yankees organization, and played in 45 games for them before retiring."

        "title": "Julio Navarro (baseball)",
        "text": "Julio Navarro Ventura (January 9, 1934 – January 24, 2018) was a Major League Baseball relief pitcher. He played for the Los Angeles Angels (1962–64), Detroit Tigers (1964–66), and Atlanta Braves (1970).\nThe 5'11\", 190 lb. right-hander with the nickname \"Whiplash\" was acquired by the Angels from the San Francisco Giants organization on September 2, 1962. Navarro made his major league debut in relief on September 3, 1962 against the New York Yankees in game 2 of a doubleheader at Yankee Stadium. He pitched three innings and gave up two earned runs in the 6–5 Angels victory. He struck out one batter, Roger Maris. He won his first major league game the very next day with 1.1 scoreless innings against New York. He retired Bobby Richardson to end the 8th, L.A. scored in the top of the 9th, and then he got Roger Maris, Elston Howard, and Johnny Blanchard to close out the game. He pitched seven more games that month, ending with a 4.70 ERA.\nThe next season, 1963, was Navarro's best statistically. He teamed with 40-year-old Art Fowler to give the Angels a pair of dependable closers. Navarro finished in the American League top ten for games pitched (57), saves (12), and games finished (30). He was 4–5 with an ERA of 2.89.\nNavarro began the 1964 season in excellent fashion. He relieved in five games for the Angels with a 1.93 ERA, then was traded to the Detroit Tigers for outfielder/pitcher Willie Smith on April 28. He was never the same after that, pitching decently for Detroit but not with the degree of effectiveness he had shown with Los Angeles. He was out of the big leagues after 1966 but returned in 1970 to make 17 appearances for the Atlanta Braves.\nCareer totals include a 7–9 record in 130 games, 1 game started, 66 games finished, 17 saves, and an ERA of 3.65. He had 151 strikeouts in 212.1 innings pitched for a 6.40 K/9IP, higher than the major league average during his era. Very good defensively, he handled 49 out of 50 total chances successfully for a fielding percentage of .980.\nHe is the father of former major league pitcher Jaime Navarro.\nNavarro died peacefully January 24, 2018 in Orlando, Florida surrounded by his beloved wife and children. He was buried at Cementerio Los Cipreses in Bayamón, Puerto Rico."

        "text": "William Winston Roper (August 22, 1880 – December 10, 1933) was an American football, basketball, and baseball player and coach. He served as the head football coach at the Virginia Military Institute (1903–1904), Princeton University (1906–1908, 1910–1911, 1919–1930), the University of Missouri (1909), and Swarthmore College (1915–1916), compiling a career college football record of 112–38–18. Roper's Princeton Tigers football teams of 1906, 1911, 1920, and 1922 have been recognized as national champions. His 89 wins are the most of any coach in the history of the program. Roper was also the head basketball coach at Princeton for one season in 1902–03, tallying a mark of 8–7. Roper played football as an end, basketball, and baseball as an outfielder at Princeton, from which he graduated in 1902. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1951.\nRoper served on the NCAA Football Rules Committee.\nEarly life and playing career.\nRoper was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on August 22, 1880. He attended the William Penn Charter School where he played football, basketball, and baseball. He continued all three sports in college at Princeton University.\nCoaching career.\nVMI.\nRoper was the sixth head football coach at Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in Lexington, Virginia, serving for two seasons, from 1903 to 1904, and compiling a record of 5–6. Roper had planned to study medicine, but was unable to, for health reasons. While a coach at VMI, he studied law, and later in life he became qualified as an attorney.\nPrinceton.\nIn 1906, Roper was the head coach at Princeton and held that position through the 1908 season. During his first stint as the head coach at Princeton, he compiled a 21–4–4 record.\nMissouri.\nRoper coached football at the University of Missouri for the 1909 season, where his team went 7–0–1 and won the Missouri Valley Conference title.\nReturn to Princeton.\nHis second stint at Princeton lasted from 1910 to 1911. During that tenure, he compiled a 15–1–2 record.\nSwarthmore.\nIn 1915 and 1916, Roper coached at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. In his two seasons at Swarthmore, the team compiled a record of 11–4–1.\nThird term at Princeton.\nIn his final stint at Princeton, Roper held his longest-tenured coaching position. His term lasted from 1919 to 1930, but ended due to an illness. He continues to hold the record for most wins by a Princeton coach.\nWilliam Winston Roper Trophy.\nPrinceton University's highest honor for a male athlete, the William Winston Roper Trophy, is named in his honor and awarded annually. Some of the more recent honorees have included NFL football player Dennis Norman (’01), lacrosse player Ryan Boyle (‘04), Olympic and world champion fencer Soren Thompson (‘05), MLB baseball player Will Venable (‘05), squash player Yasser El Halaby ('06), and lacrosse player Peter Trombino ('07).\nPolitical and business career.\nIn 1912, United States President Woodrow Wilson appointed Roper as the appraiser of merchandise at the Port of Philadelphia. He was later a member of the Philadelphia City Council and the local manager of the Prudential Insurance Company. As a politician he worked successfully to repeal prohibition, though he himself was a teetotaller, and to change Pennsylvania's blue laws, which did not allow sports on Sundays."

In this tournament, some 30 teams played in the men's competition, and 8 teams participated in women's competition.\nTurkmenistan, and Yemen withdrew from the competition before playing their first match. The organisation announced a new competition format because of this. Instead of only the group winners of the first round to go through to the second round, now also both runners-up qualified.\nLater India also announced their retirement, however they remained in the tournament on a \"no cost to government basis\". Iran was taken out of competition prior to their first match, due to a suspension by FIFA. However, FIFA lifted the suspension on Iran under-23 team on 26 November 2006 so they returned to the original Group D stage.\nAge limit for the men teams is under-23, same as the age limit in football competitions in Olympic Games, while three overage players are allowed among each squad.\nVenue.\nThere are 3 host cities, including 7 stadiums hosted the tournament.\nDraw.\nThe draw ceremony for the team sports was held on 7 September 2006 at Doha.\nMen.\nEight teams who did not enter 2002 had to play in Round 1; 22 other teams qualify directly for the tournament proper.\nImpact on Qatar.\nScholars suggest that the 2006 Asian Games had long-term consequences for Qatar by boosting its tourist economy, aiding in economic diversification away from oil, and encouraging infrastructural development, while anticipating Qatar's bid for the 2022 FIFA World Cup."

        "text": "In golf, a gimme is a shot that the other players agree can count automatically without being played.\nWhen a player has only a very short putt left to play, other players may grant a gimme (i.e., one stroke is counted), but the ball is not played. A gimme is a time-saving convention under the tacit assumption that the putt would not have been missed, e.g., when the ball is within a few inches of the hole.\nGimmes are not allowed by the rules in stroke play, though the practice is common in casual matches. However, in match play, either player may formally \"concede\" a stroke, a hole, or the entire match at any time, and this may not be refused or withdrawn. A player in match play will generally concede a tap-in or other short putt by his or her opponent.\nThe word is a colloquial contraction of the phrase \"give me\"."

        "title": "2007 Major League Baseball All-Star Game",
        "text": "The 2007 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 78th midseason exhibition between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and the National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was held on July 10, 2007, at AT&amp;T Park, the home of the NL's San Francisco Giants. It marked the third time that the Giants hosted the All Star Game since moving to San Francisco for the 1958 season. The 1961 and 1984 All Star Games were played at the Giants former home Candlestick Park, and the fourth overall in the Bay Area, with the Giants bay area rivals the Oakland Athletics hosting once back in 1987, and the second straight held in an NL ballpark.\nThe American League defeated the National League by a score of 5–4. Ichiro Suzuki won the MVP award for the game for hitting the first inside-the-park home run in All-Star history. As per the 2006 Collective Bargaining Agreement, the American League champion (which eventually came to be the Boston Red Sox) received home field advantage in the 2007 World Series. The victory was the 10th consecutive (excluding the 2002 tie) for the AL, and their 11-game unbeaten streak is only beaten by the NL's 11-game winning streak from 1972 to 1982 in All-Star history.\nBackground.\nAs with each All-Star Game since 1970, the eight starting position players (with no designated hitter due to playing in an NL stadium) of each league were elected by fan balloting. The remaining players were selected by a players' vote, each league's team manager, and a second fan balloting to add one more player to each roster. In all, 32 players were selected to each league's team, not including players who decline to play due to injuries or personal reasons.\nThe Giants were awarded the game on February 9, 2005. The game marked the first time since 1962 that one league hosted consecutive All-Star Games, after Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, hosted the game in 2006.\nThe game was the fifth straight All-Star Game to decide home-field advantage in the World Series. The AL entered the game on a ten-game unbeaten streak (nine wins, with one tie in 2002). The NL was looking for their first win since the 1996 game in Philadelphia.\nFan balloting.\nStarters.\nBalloting for the 2007 All-Star Game starters (excluding pitchers) began on April 27 and continued through June 28. The top vote-getters at each position and the top three among outfielders are named the starters for their respective leagues. The results were announced on July 1. About 18.5 million votes were cast by close to 12 million fans. Alex Rodriguez was the leading vote-getter with 3,890,515 votes, easily outpacing his Yankees teammate Derek Jeter by over 700,000 votes. Ken Griffey Jr., was the top vote-getter in the National League, with 2,986,818 votes.\nFinal roster spot.\nAfter the rosters were announced, a second round of fan voting, the Monster All-Star Final Vote, was commenced to determine the occupant of the final roster spot for each team. This round lasted until July 5. Chris Young and Hideki Okajima were elected to represent the National League and American League, respectively, in the All-Star Game as first time All-Stars. All ten players included in the balloting were pitchers, a first for the event.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nNational League.\nThese players did not see action in the game.&lt;br&gt;\nVoted onto the roster through the All-Star Final Vote.&lt;br&gt;\nUnable to play due to injury. Brandon Webb took his roster spot.&lt;br&gt;\nUnable to play due to injury. Roy Oswalt took his roster spot.\nManagers.\nNational League: \"Tony La Russa\"\nAmerican League: \"Jim Leyland\"\nGame.\n\"O Canada\" was played by members of the San Francisco Symphony. \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was sung by Chris Isaak. Before the game, there was a tribute to former San Francisco Giants slugger Willie Mays. Mays threw the ceremonial first pitch to New York Mets shortstop José Reyes. Paula Cole sang \"God Bless America\" during the seventh-inning stretch. The first pitch was thrown by the National League's starter, Jake Peavy at 8:54 EDT The game was completed in 3 hours, 6 minutes under an overcast sky and a gametime temperature of .\nUmpires.\nUmpires for the game were announced on June 14. Bruce Froemming, the most tenured current umpire in Major League Baseball, was named crew chief for the game. It was also revealed that day that Froemming would retire following the 2007 season.\nGame summary.\nThe National League got things started in the bottom of the first when José Reyes led off with a base hit off American League starter Dan Haren and proceeded to steal second. He scored on an RBI single by Ken Griffey Jr. to give the NL a 1–0 lead. Barry Bonds nearly gave his hometown fans something to cheer for in the bottom of the third when, with Reyes on second, he lofted a high fly ball to left field, but it was snared at the warning track by Magglio Ordóñez. The AL nearly tied the game in the fourth when Alex Rodriguez attempted to score on a two-out single by Iván Rodríguez. However, the throw to home plate by Griffey allowed Russell Martin to tag Rodriguez out at the plate to end the inning. The AL would score one inning later when, after Chris Young issued a leadoff walk to Brian Roberts, Ichiro Suzuki hit a long fly ball off the right field wall. Instead of caroming straight to Griffey, the ball took an unusual bounce off a sign and ricocheted to Griffey's right. This allowed Ichiro to score on what is still the only inside-the-park home run in All-Star Game history. The homer gave the AL a 2–1 lead and resulted in Ichiro's MVP win.\nThe lead would be augmented in the sixth when Carl Crawford hit a line drive that just cleared the right field wall for a home run. Though it appeared a fan may have reached over the wall to catch it, NL manager Tony La Russa did not challenge the umpires' call. The NL got a run back in the bottom of the inning when Carlos Beltrán led off with a triple and scored on a sacrifice fly by Griffey. The AL added some insurance runs in the eighth when Víctor Martínez hit a two-run home run just inside the left field foul pole to give the AL a 5–2 lead.\nThe American League's closers then entered the game, with Jonathan Papelbon pitching a scoreless bottom of the eighth. In the ninth, J. J. Putz tried to earn the save and began by inducing a weak pop-up and striking out Brian McCann. Pinch-hitter Dmitri Young rolled a ground ball deep in the hole to Brian Roberts, but he could not come up with it. Alfonso Soriano followed with a two-run home run to right field to cut the NL's deficit to one. After Putz walked J. J. Hardy, AL manager Jim Leyland replaced him with Francisco Rodríguez. However, Rodriguez had trouble consistently locating his pitches and walked Derrek Lee on a check-swing 3–2 pitch and then Orlando Hudson to load the bases. In a move that drew criticism, La Russa elected not to pinch-hit his last player on the bench, Albert Pujols, and instead let Aaron Rowand hit. Rowand lofted a fly ball to right field that was caught by Alex Ríos to close the game, earning the American League their tenth consecutive victory.\nHome Run Derby.\nThe State Farm Home Run Derby was held the night before the All-Star Game, July 9, and broadcast on ESPN. Four players from each league competed to hit as many home runs as they could in each round to advance and eventually win the contest. This year, a five-swing swing-off would be used to break ties occurring in any round. This became necessary when Albert Pujols and Justin Morneau tied for fourth in the first round. The champion of last year's Derby, Ryan Howard of the Philadelphia Phillies, competed even though he was not named to the NL All-Star roster.\nIn the finals, Vladimir Guerrero of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim defeated Alex Ríos of the Toronto Blue Jays by a score of 3–2. Guerrero hit 17 home runs in all, second only to Ríos' 19. Guerrero also hit the longest blast of the competition, a drive to left field that just missed hitting a giant replica glove and baseball set up on the concourse beyond the left field bleachers.\nAT&amp;T Park is distinguished by having the San Francisco Bay beyond its right field bleachers. The body of water located adjacent to the ballpark is known as McCovey Cove, named for legendary Giants slugger Willie McCovey. McCovey Cove is known for having many fans sitting in the water in kayaks and boats hoping to retrieve a long home run ball hit there. Though dozens of fans waited in the cove during the Derby, no home runs were actually hit into the water, either on the fly or off the promenade next to the right field seats, though, two foul balls hit by Justin Morneau and Prince Fielder did reach the water. This was largely due to the three left-handed competitors all exiting in the first round, as well as wind currents blowing toward left field. Prior to the All-Star break, a total of 58 home runs were hit into the cove on the fly during the park's history.\nGold balls were utilized whenever any player had one out remaining during his round. Any home runs hit with the balls meant Major League Baseball and State Farm would pledge to donate money to the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America. Due to the change in sponsors from Century 21 to State Farm, each ball's value was reduced to US$17,000 to reflect the 17,000 State Farm agents in the United States and Canada. In all, twelve gold ball home runs were hit, which, along with a $50,000 \"bonus\" constituted $254,000 raised for charity.\nRecorded only seven of ten outs before hitting winning home run.&lt;br&gt;\nAdvanced after defeating Morneau 2–1 in a swing-off.\nFutures Game.\nThe 2007 XM All-Star Futures Game took place on July 8, showcasing the top minor league prospects from all thirty teams' farm systems. The contest is seven innings regardless of the score with pitchers limited to no more than one inning of work. The World team defeated the United States by a score of 7–2. Chin-Lung Hu of the Los Angeles Dodgers organization won the Larry Doby MVP award after driving in two runs on a single and double, plus a stolen base and a run."

        "title": "Ray Sanders (baseball)",
        "text": "Raymond Floyd Sanders (December 4, 1916 – October 28, 1983) was a professional baseball player. Primarily a first baseman, he played all or part of six seasons in Major League Baseball between 1942 and 1949.\nEarly life.\nSanders was born in Bonne Terre, Missouri.\nPlaying career.\nCardinals.\nSanders was originally signed by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1938. From 1939 to 1941 he was named to his league's all-star team as either a starter or honorable mention each year.\nFollowing the 1941 season, Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey traded future Hall of Fame first baseman Johnny Mize to the New York Giants, opening a spot for Sanders. Sanders made his MLB debut for the Cardinals on April 14, 1942. He and Johnny Hopp split time at first base through mid August, with Hopp receiving the lion's share of playing time from that point on, as well as starting all five games in the 1942 World Series, which the Cardinals won over the New York Yankees.\nSanders became the Cardinals full-time first baseman in 1943, with Hopp moving to a utility role. The Cardinals won their second straight National League pennant, but lost a rematch with the Yankees in the 1943 World Series in five games. In their lone win in Game Two, Sanders followed Whitey Kurowski's home run with one of his own, which wound up being the margin of victory in the 4–3 win.\nIn 1944, Sanders had his best year, finishing 15th in the voting for the National League Most Valuable Player Award. He set career highs in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in, helping the Cardinals to return to the 1944 World Series. This time playing against the St. Louis Browns in their only World Series appearance, Sanders hit a home run in Game Five to help the Cardinals to a 2–0 win, with the Cardinals also winning Game Six to close out the Series.\nIn 1945, the Cardinals lost several of their star players, most notably Stan Musial, to World War II service, and failed to return to the World Series, finishing three games behind the Chicago Cubs. When Musial returned in 1946, the team intended to make him their regular first baseman. To make room, Sanders' contract was sold to the Boston Braves for $25,000.\nBraves.\nSanders began the 1946 season as the Braves' regular first baseman, but he suffered a severe arm injury in August in a collision with Erv Dusak and missed the rest of the season. Hopp, who had also been acquired by the Braves during the previous offseason, once again filling in for him. Sanders, whose arm had been broken in three places missed the entire 1947 season as well. Meanwhile, Earl Torgeson had entrenched himself as the Braves' starting first baseman in the interim.\nOn March 6, 1948, Sanders was involved in yet another trade centering on a future Hall of Famer. The Brooklyn Dodgers had used Jackie Robinson as a first baseman in 1947, but in 1948 the decision was made to move him to his more natural position as a second baseman. To make room, their 1947 second baseman, Eddie Stanky, was traded to the Braves for Sanders, Bama Rowell and $40,000. Sanders did not stay in the Dodgers organization long however, as he was returned to the Braves on April 18 for $60,000, partially because he was \"damaged goods\" since his arm still hadn't healed fully.\nSanders began the 1948 season in the minor leagues, first with the Pacific Coast League's Seattle Rainiers. When he was unable to get playing time due to Seattle's high level of talent, he was reassigned to the Class A Hartford Chiefs. He finally returned to the major leagues in September, appearing in five games, all as a pinch hitter. Despite his lack of playing time, he was on the Braves' roster for the 1948 World Series due to injuries to Jeff Heath and Jim Russell. In his lone appearance in the Series, he made the last out of Game Two off Bob Lemon as a pinch hitter, tapping the first pitch he saw back to the mound.\nSanders made the Braves as a bench player in 1949, but again missed most of the season due to injury. He broke his wrist during spring training, and wound up playing just nine games, his last in the major leagues, with his final game coming on September 1. After spending 1950 with the minor league Milwaukee Brewers, he retired.\nCareer Statistics.\nIn a seven-year, 630 game career, Sanders compiled a .274 batting average (597-for-2182) with 321 runs, 42 home runs and 329 RBI. He posted a career .991 fielding percentage. In four World Series appearances (1942,'43,'44,'48) he batted .275 (11-for-40) with 9 runs, 2 home runs, 3 RBI and 9 walks.\nLater life.\nWell after his playing days, Sanders went into scouting with the Cleveland Indians. He was married to Bernice Magre of Crystal City, Missouri for 40 years, and they had a daughter (Sandra) and a son (James). Sanders died in an automobile accident in Washington, Missouri."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in England and North America in 1878",
        "text": "From May to September in 1878, an Australian cricket team made the inaugural first-class tour of England by a representative overseas side. In October, the Australians played additional matches in the US and Canada on their return journey. The tour followed one made by an England team to Australia in 1876–77, during which the first matches retrospectively given Test match status were played. None of the 1878 matches had international status, nevertheless the tour proved to be such an outstanding financial and sporting success that the future of international cricket was assured.\nThe Australian team was managed by John Conway and captained by Dave Gregory. William Gibbes, who was a non-player, acted as the team's assistant-manager and secretary. Conway was a journalist from Geelong, Victoria while Gregory and Gibbes were both Sydney-based accountants working for the New South Wales Public Service. These three cricket enthusiasts were the architects of the venture. They and the players each contributed the sum of £50 to finance the expedition and later shared equally in the handsome profits that their enterprise generated, having carted the match takings around with them in a closely guarded strong-box all the time that they were away.\nGregory demonstrated excellent leadership and tactical skills throughout the long tour, while Fred Spofforth became the star performer of the team. Cricket scholars consider him to have been one of the greatest fast bowlers in the history of the game.\nPreliminaries.\nDuring the English tour of Australia in 1876–77, the Australian all-rounder and impresario John Conway met the English captain James Lillywhite in Melbourne and discussed the potential profitability of an Australian team visiting England. Lillywhite agreed to take soundings at home and see if the major English teams would consider hosting a team of \"the best cricketers in the colonies\". During the 1877 English season, Lillywhite made enquiries and was encouraged by the feedback. He contacted Conway to report interest and, with the possibility of \"good money\", offered to arrange a fixture list. Conway negotiated with Dave Gregory who had captained the \"Combined XI from Sydney and Melbourne\" against Lillywhite's professionals in what latterly became recognised as the first two Test matches. It was agreed that the players would form a private company by contributing £50 each to cover expenses, profits to be shared accordingly although Conway as manager would take 7.5% of gross proceeds.\nThe team sailed from Sydney on 29 March 1878 in the , reaching San Francisco on 27 April, having called at Auckland and Honolulu \"en route\". They then traveled across America by train, a potentially hazardous undertaking in the era of the James–Younger Gang and others, though Frank and Jesse James were still in hiding after the abortive Northfield Raid in 1876. The Australians sailed from New York on 4 May in the , which docked at Liverpool on 13 May. The team caught the train to Nottingham and arrived there at 12:15 on 14 May to a large reception. On 20 May, they began their first match at Trent Bridge against Nottinghamshire.\nTouring party.\nThe Australian party was composed of: J. Conway (Victoria; manager), W. C. V. Gibbes (assistant-manager), D. W. Gregory (New South Wales; captain), F. E. Allan (Victoria), G. H. Bailey (Tasmania), A. C. Bannerman (New South Wales), C. Bannerman (New South Wales), J. McC. Blackham (Victoria; wicket-keeper), H. F. Boyle (Victoria), T. W. Garrett (New South Wales), T. P. Horan (Victoria), W. E. Midwinter (Victoria), W. L. Murdoch (New South Wales) and F. R. Spofforth (New South Wales). Midwinter was already in England and joined the team in Nottingham for their opening game.\nMatches and incidents.\nMCC v Australians.\n\"27 May\". MCC \"versus\" Australians at Lord's. The Australians established their reputation for all time by a nine wicket victory inside five hours in one of the most sensational games in history. A strong MCC team, led by W. G. Grace himself, was bowled out for 33 (Spofforth 6–4, including a hat trick) and though they in turn dismissed the Aussies for 41 (Shaw 5–10, Morley 5-31), MCC in their second innings were out for just 19 (Boyle 5–3, Spofforth 5–16). The Australians needed 12 to win, which was a substantial total in the conditions, but they lost only their star batsman Charles Bannerman in getting them. Spofforth's match analysis was 14.3 overs, five maidens, 20 runs, 11 wickets. This match inspired Punch to publish the following verse:\nMidwinter dispute.\n\"20 – 22 June\". Middlesex \"versus\" Australians at Lord's and Surrey \"versus\" Gloucestershire at The Oval. Shortly before play was due to begin at Lord's, WG Grace and others of the Gloucestershire camp turned up and effectively \"nabbed\" Billy Midwinter, taking him to the Oval to play for Gloucestershire. Midwinter had played for them in 1877 and Grace argued that he was bound to continue if required. Since Gloucestershire had arrived at the Oval with only ten players, Midwinter most definitely was required.\nA dispute ensued and all sorts of agreements and contractual arrangements were argued over. It seems that WG was at first rude and insulting, then tried to brazen it out before offering a guarded apology and eventually getting around to his favourite topic: money. Midwinter apparently did quite well out of it all despite being anything but an innocent party. The Aussies got some satisfaction when they beat Middlesex by 98 runs without Midwinter while Gloucestershire, with Midwinter, lost by 16 runs to Surrey. But the real revenge came later.\nGloucestershire v Australians.\n\"5 – 6 Sept\". Gloucestershire \"versus\" Australians (Clifton College). Australians won by 10 wkts. This was the champion county's only home defeat of the season. All three Graces were playing but not Midwinter. Aussie revenge was complete thanks to a 12-90 match haul by the Demon, though he did not get WG's wicket.\nPlayers v Australians.\n\"11 – 12 Sept\". Players \"versus\" Australians at Prince's Ground ended the Australian tour and was also the last time Prince's Ground (in Chelsea) was used as a first-class venue, Middlesex having moved to Lord's in 1877.\nNorth American leg of the tour.\nAt the end of their tour, the Australians sailed from Liverpool on 18 September in the . They arrived in New York over a week later and went on to Philadelphia where they played the Philadelphian cricket team on 3–5 October at the Germantown Ground. This match, which is now unofficially rated first-class, was disrupted by disputes and walk-offs before it ended in a draw. The tourists played five other games, all minor fixtures, in Hoboken, Toronto, Montreal, St Louis and San Francisco. They sailed from San Francisco on 28 October in the , arriving in Sydney on 25 November after being away for almost eight months.\nAncillary note: In San Francisco, the Australian team had played a California XXII side composed of members from the Occidental and Oakland Cricket Clubs. The Oakland club was the first cricket team established on the East Bay, which became home to several cricket teams between 1878 and 1913. This was the first time a California side played an Australian national side.\nAftermath of the Midwinter incident.\nMeanwhile, back in England, the Graces endured months of controversy about the payments they received as supposed amateurs, much of which had come to light as a result of the Midwinter affair. Charges were brought against them at a stormy meeting of the Gloucestershire club's members and they were vilified in the press. In the end, little came of it. The Graces had too much influence. WG was simply too popular to be challenged and EM as a coroner was seen to be a \"pillar of the community\". So, although their ears burned, they escaped censure and nothing much changed."

        "text": "Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse (Meilhan, 6 September 1760 – Meilhan, 10 September 1829) was a French sailor, admiral and hero of the French Revolutionary Wars.\nCareer.\nLacrosse joined the Navy in 1779 as a Garde marine. He rose to enseign in 1782, to lieutenant in 1786, and to capitaine de vaisseau in 1792. He was military governor of Saint Lucia in 1792 to 1793.\nIn 1795, he was sent to Martinique and Guadeloupe to crush revolts. On his return to France, Lacrosse was arrested.\nFreed, he was attached to the planned invasion of Ireland in late 1796, commanding the 74-gun \"Droits de l'Homme\". The invasion failed, and on her journey back, the \"Droits de l'Homme\" fought the action of 13 January 1797 against two British frigates, the \"Indefatigable\" under Sir Edward Pellew and the \"Amazon\". Lacrosse was wounded and his ship was lost when she ran aground.\nDespite the loss of his ship, Lacrosse was made contre-amiral. In 1799, he was sent as ambassador to Spain and notably negotiated the forcible return of émigréssl to France. He was offered the Ministry of Marine, which he declined.\nIn 1802, First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte made him general captain of Guadeloupe. On 1 November 1801, Lacrosse was captured by rebels, as he was leading a reconnaissance out of Pointe-à-Pitre. Pelage, the leader of the rebels, brought him aboard a Danish ship. Lacrosse set out for Dominica, where he joined the expedition led by General Antoine Richepanse, and returned with it to Guadeloupe. When Richepanse died, Lacrosse took command and managed to crush the rebellion and to restore slavery.\nIn Guadeloupe, Lacrosse sent the military to track down farmers, who were treated as rebels and summarily killed.\nLacrosse sailed back to France aboard the frigate \"Didon\". He did not know that the Peace of Amiens had ended and that hostilities had resumed with the British. Off Brest, he ran into twelve British ships of the line blockading the port. He managed to evade the blockading fleet and captured the corvette \"Laurier\" in the process. He reached Spain, left his prize in Santander and returned to France.\nNapoléon made him préfet maritime and gave him command of the flotilla intended to ferry troops for an invasion of England. Lacrosse was made commander of the Légion d'Honneur at the founding of the Order. When Admiral Bruix died in 1805, Lacrosse succeeded him as commander-in-chief of the navy.\nLacrosse retired in 1815 and died in his hometown of Meilhan on 10 September 1829.\nReferences.\n "

        "title": "Equestrian statue of the Duke of Wellington, Aldershot",
        "text": "The Wellington statue in Aldershot, England is a monument to Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, victor at the Battle of Waterloo and later prime minister of the United Kingdom. Sculpted by Matthew Cotes Wyatt, it was the largest equestrian statue in Britain when it was unveiled at its original location on the Wellington Arch at Hyde Park Corner in 1846.\nOrigins.\nIn 1837 a committee was formed under the chairmanship of the Duke of Rutland to raise sufficient funds for a memorial to the Duke of Wellington. The sculptor was Matthew Cotes Wyatt. In the statue Wellington is shown on Copenhagen, the famous charger he had ridden at Waterloo. Much of the bronze in the statue is derived from French cannon captured at Waterloo and remelted in Wyatt's foundry. Wellington himself sat for the sculptor; Copenhagen, however, had died and a substitute horse was used as a model. This offended many at the time, who saw a poor likeness to Copenhagen in the statue.\nThe position selected for the sculpture was on top of the triumphal arch at Hyde Park Corner, built in 1827–28 in conjunction with an Ionic screen as part of a processional route between the park and Buckingham Palace. Wellington had his London residence at Apsley House, immediately next to the screen.\nThe work was executed at Wyatt's workshop at Dudley House in the Harrow Road, starting in May 1840. The modelling work was done by Wyatt's son James Wyatt. The model consisted of more than three tons of plaster of Paris formed over a timber frame with a beam for the backbone and transverse timbers like the ribs of a ship. The model was on a turntable in diameter and the artists could reach all parts of it by means of an adjustable stage that could be raised and lowered. The modelling work took three years.\nFor casting, the model was lowered into a pit in a specially built foundry. The statue was cast in bronze melted in two furnaces; one could melt twelve tons at a time, but this was found insufficient, so a second furnace of 20 tons capacity was constructed. Even so, the body of the horse and the lower limbs of the Duke were cast in two pieces and the rest of the statue was cast in a further six pieces, all between thick. The legs of the horse were cast solid so as to bear the great weight.\nAt the time it was the largest equestrian statue in Britain, being high, from Copenhagen's nose to tail, and in girth. It weighed 40 tons. In 1846 the statue was moved with great pageantry from Wyatt's workshop to Hyde Park Corner. It was transported on a huge, low carriage with wheels in diameter, constructed by H.M. Dockyards at Woolwich. The carriage was hauled by a hundred men of the Scots Fusilier Guards; as it emerged on to the road, it was greeted by enthusiastic cheers from the crowd of sightseers. Twenty-nine horses then drew the carriage to Hyde Park Corner. It took some hours to get the statue into position for hoisting and the final lift and fixing into position on the victory arch was completed the following day.\nMove to Aldershot.\nMany thought the statue out of proportion to the arch: its architect, Decimus Burton, especially disliked it, and left money in his will for the statue's removal. Queen Victoria also regarded it as an eyesore, marring the view from Buckingham Palace; however, it could not be tactfully moved during the lifetime of the Duke of Wellington, who would have seen such a move as an insult.\nIn 1882–83 the arch was moved a short distance, to its present location on Hyde Park Corner; the statue of Wellington was removed and left in Green Park while its future location was debated. In 1883 the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII, suggested that it should be moved to Aldershot Military Town, \"where it will be highly regarded by the Army\". Eventually Parliament agreed with his suggestion and the statue was taken to Aldershot for reassembly. Its removal from the arch had been a relief to the many critics who had considered it out of proportion and inappropriate for such a location.\nOn a visit to Aldershot, the Prince of Wales selected Round Hill, close by the Royal Pavilion and Royal Garrison Church, as the new site for the statue. Moving Wyatt's creation from London was no mean feat. However, it was successfully and ceremoniously handed to the British Army in August 1885 in front of a large crowd of onlookers.\nRestoration.\nThe statue fell into a poor condition in the latter half of the twentieth century, being largely hidden behind overgrown trees and bushes on Round Hill. In early 2004 Aldershot Garrison, supported by local conservation groups and volunteers, commenced a major restoration project to restore it to its original condition. The bushes were cleared and the statue was re-bronzed.\nThe Friends of the Aldershot Military Museum have taken on the role of \"Friends of the Statue\", supported by Aldershot Garrison, Rushmoor Council and the Blackwater Valley Countryside Partnership.\nAs of November 2022, a visit to the statue is rated by Tripadvisor as 19th-best thing to do in Aldershot."

        "text": "Cricket whites, also known as flannels, the kit, costume or uniform worn by most cricketers, and usually consists of trousers, shirt and a jumper.\nOriginally, as indicated by the name whites, flannels were exclusively white or cream. Today, many competitions (particularly in the shortened one-day version of cricket) are played in coloured kit, also sometimes known as pyjamas.\nFlannels were originally made from a variety of flannel materials. Typically, modern flannels will have trousers made with a high elastic content, to prevent damage while fielding. Shirts and jumpers can be short or long-sleeved, the former being particularly favoured by bowlers. Wicketkeepers mostly wear long-sleeved shirts, in order to avoid abrasions from the grass when diving for the ball, which is also true for some players while batting due to a similar risk. Jumpers are traditionally made with a cable-knit design.\nThe term flannels is also used in baseball, especially in a historical context when the uniforms were made of wool flannel.\nAt the international level, whites are only worn during Test cricket. One Day International and Twenty20 matches are played with the teams wearing team uniforms in particular colours. One-Day Internationals were first played in whites but since December 2000 all ODI cricket has been played in coloured clothing – for example, the Black Caps of New Zealand currently wear a black uniform when playing a one-day match."

        "title": "Adam Jones (rugby union, born 1981)",
        "text": "Adam Rhys Jones (born 8 March 1981) is a Welsh former professional international rugby union player for and the British &amp; Irish Lions. He is currently scrum coach for Premiership Rugby club Harlequins.\nHe is one of a small group of Welsh players to have won three Grand Slams, including Gerald Davies, Gareth Edwards, JPR Williams, Ryan Jones, Gethin Jenkins and Alun Wyn Jones.\nClub career.\nJones began his career with Neath before switching to the Ospreys with the regionalisation of Welsh rugby in 2003.\nIn his early career Jones was often criticised for a lack of scrummaging power, but he has answered those critics with several seasons of dogged and dependable work in the front row of both Wales and the Ospreys. He developed the ability to scrum very low, and to manipulate his weight positioning, in order to drive the loosehead's head towards his left knee.\nAfter the 2013–14 season, Jones left the Ospreys, refusing to sign a new contract until a dispute between the Welsh regions and the WRU was resolved. On 19 August 2014, he was unveiled as a new signing by Cardiff Blues.\nInternational.\nFollowing several successful seasons at club level, Jones received a call up to the Wales squad in 2003, making his debut as a replacement against England during the 2003 Six Nations.\nJones almost immediately pinned down the No.3 jersey and was selected for Wales' World Cup squad at the end of 2003. He featured in all of Wales' games at the tournament, starting in the crucial group games against Italy and New Zealand and the quarter final loss to England. At the time, fears over Jones' fitness led to him only playing the first half of games, a trend that he emphatically ended as his career developed.\nJones continued to hold down the starting tighthead spot through the 2004 Six Nations and autumn Internationals.\nIn 2005, Jones was a key member of the Welsh Grand Slam-winning side, starting all five of Wales' games en route to their historic achievement, it was alongside Gethin Jenkins that he provided a platform for the side in 2005.\nJones was a solid presence during the 2006 Six Nations, and was also one of the senior squad members for Wales' summer tour to Argentina. Following a difficult tournament for Wales in the 2007 Six Nations, Jones was selected for his second World Cup in the autumn of 2007.\nIn that year's World Cup Jones played in the group stage against Canada and Australia, but was dropped in favour of Worcester's Chris Horsman for the crucial final group game against Fiji. Bouncing back from the disappointment of the World Cup, Jones played in four of Wales' games on their way to the Grand Slam in the 2008 Six Nations.\nJones' improvement under the guidance of Warren Gatland saw him selected for the 2009 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to South Africa and he made the squad for the first Test in Durban. After shoring up the Lions' retreating scrum in the first Test, Jones started the narrow second Test loss to South Africa in Pretoria. In June 2009 Gethin Jenkins, Jones and Matthew Rees were selected as the British &amp; Irish Lions front row for the 2nd Test against South Africa. This was the first time an all-Welsh front row was selected for a Lions test match since Billy Williams, Bryn Meredith and Courtney Meredith on the 1955 Lions tour. Jones was sent home after the 2nd test match with South Africa in which they lost 28–25 after dislocating his right shoulder. Jones was sidelined for six months with the injury and had surgery on torn shoulder ligaments. During the two Tests, Jones was on the field for 81 minutes, during which the British Lions scored 30 points and conceded 15. In his absence, the Lions scored 16 points and conceded 39.\nHis effort was ended by a dislocated shoulder suffered during the game after a challenge from Springboks lock Bakkies Botha and he was ruled out of the third Test. Jones' shoulder injury came after Botha attempted to clear him from a ruck and the Bulls star was subsequently cited and banned for two weeks for the challenge. Jones was ruled out for six weeks with the injury, returning for the Ospreys at Christmas in 2009 and for Wales ahead of the 2010 Six Nations.\nJones is well known for his front row partnership at the Ospreys and Wales with Duncan Jones (no relation). Together, they are affectionately known as the \"Hair Bears\", because of their recognisable hairdos.\nIn the May 2010 edition of Rugby World, it was reported he has 'slimmed down' to a 'svelte' 19 stones by cutting out junk food, beer and gaining focus in training.\nIn January 2011 the Ospreys prop was injured in the first half of the region's Heineken Cup loss to London Irish and scans confirmed ligament damage and a lay-off of eight weeks. He returned to the Wales squad for their final Six Nations match against France.\nIn August 2011 Jones was named in the 30-man squad for the Rugby World Cup in New Zealand. The Welsh team performed admirably, reaching the semi-finals. Jones played a vital role in providing a platform for Wales' exciting backs to score many tries. He played against South Africa, Samoa, Fiji and Ireland before injuring his calf within the first 10 minutes of the semi-final against France.\nHe returned to full fitness in December 2011, and did enough to earn selection for Wales' 35-man squad for the training camp in Poland prior to the 2012 Six Nations.\nHe was part of the 37-man squad for the 2013 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia.\nOn 24 January 2015, Jones announced his retirement from international rugby.\nOn 26 March 2015, it was announced that Jones would join Aviva Premiership side Harlequins from the 2015–16 season. Jones played for Harlequins until the end of the 2017–18 season, increasingly moving from playing to coaching during that time. Notably, on 8 October 2016, Jones was called up to the bench as a very late replacement for the game against Northampton Saints. Following a very early injury in the game Jones ended-up having to play nearly the whole match at loosehead, to considerable praise.\nJones announced his complete retirement from the game on 25 March 2018, effective from the end of the 2017–18 season.\nSince 2018, Jones has been Harlequins Scrum and Transition coach."

A native of El Monte, California, the , right-hander was signed by the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent before the 1949 season. He played for the Yankees (1951–52; 1954–56), Kansas City Athletics (1957), Detroit Tigers (1958–60), Washington Senators (1960) and Los Angeles Angels (1961–63).\nA farmer in his native California, his nickname was \"Plowboy.\"\nPlaying career.\nMorgan was both as a starting pitcher and as a relief pitcher during his career. In his first five seasons he had a combined 38-22 record with 26 saves for the Yankees and appeared in three World Series (1952, 1955, and 1956). He started 46 games for New York and relieved in 110 others.\nOn June 30, 1954, Morgan tied a Major League Baseball record for most hit batsmen in an inning (3) vs. the Boston Red Sox.\nFrom 1957 to 1960 he pitched mostly in relief for the A's, Tigers, and Senators, with a record of 16-21 and 18 saves in 167 games.

Morgan's combined record for those two seasons was 13-4 with 19 saves and a 2.57 earned run average in 107 relief appearances. He pitched poorly during the first half of the 1963 season and was eventually released.\nCareer totals include a 67-47 record in 443 games pitched, 61 games started, 18 complete games, 7 shutouts, 204 games finished, 64 saves, and an ERA of 3.61.

He made two errors in his last five seasons (202 games).\nCoaching career.\nAfter his player career was over, Morgan worked as a pitching coach for the California Angels from 1972–74 and 1981–83, the San Diego Padres in 1975, and the Yankees in 1979. Nolan Ryan cited him as the first one to teach him about pitching mechanics when he arrived with the Angels in 1972, and Ryan would go on to a Hall of Fame career\nHe also worked as a minor league instructor for the Angels and a scout for the Yankees and Atlanta Braves. In 1980, when Tommy John was struggling, Morgan gave him advice regarding his throwing motion after seeing the pitcher on TV. John said the mechanical correction helped him out of a slump. Morgan continued to help John when the pitcher joined the Angels in 1982, and he aided John again in 1984 even after being dismissed from the Angels. However, Morgan did not get along well with the younger pitchers on the staff, who considered the coach too abrasive.\nDeath.\nTom Morgan died on Thursday, January 15, 1987, at age 56 due to complications from a stroke he had suffered one week earlier."

        "text": "The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes is a 1995 American made-for-television science fiction comedy film directed by Peyton Reed (in his feature directorial debut) and written by Joseph L. McEveety and Ryan Rowe. The film is a remake of the 1969 film of the same name. It premiered on ABC as an ABC Family Movie on February 18, 1995. It is the second in a series of four remakes of Disney live-action films produced for broadcast on the network during the 1994–95 television season, the other three being \"The Shaggy Dog\", \"Escape to Witch Mountain\", and \"Freaky Friday\".\nThe film stars Kirk Cameron in the lead role of Dexter Riley, a boy who becomes an instant genius, with encyclopedic knowledge. The film also co-stars Larry Miller and Dean Jones plays the role of an evil dean from a competing school.\nPlot.\nDexter, a once lazy and underachieving student at Medfield College, becomes an instant genius when a freak computer lab accident transfers an entire online encyclopedia to his brain. He uses his newfound intellect to ace a physics midterm in under ten minutes. The dean of Medfield College wishes to capitalize on Dexter’s superb intelligence by placing him on the school's quiz bowl team and allowing him to recruit his friends as teammates.\nMedfield College wins several quiz bowls matches with Dexter exclusively answering every question. He receives national recognition and generates positive publicity for Medfield College. Dexter's success also has a negative impact. His friends believe he is becoming too conceited and contemplate leaving the quiz bowl team. Norwood Gill, a child prodigy and computer hacker from a rival school, develops an obsession with Dexter, and probes into his background. Government agents also investigate Dexter as a potential computer hacker known as \"Viper\".\nNorwood ultimately uncovers the origin of Dexter's intellect. He exposes the information during a quiz bowl broadcast, but the revelation is largely dismissed by the audience. As Norwood prepares to compete against Dexter in the quiz bowl championship, he infects him with a computer virus that negates his encyclopedic knowledge. The virus takes full-effect midway through the championship, forcing Dexter to rely on his teammates for support. Medfield College ultimately wins the championship and celebrates. Norwood is apprehended by government agents for committing several cybercrimes.\nReception.\n\"Variety\" gave the film a moderately positive review, calling it an \"utterly silly yarn\" that \"lacks the zaniness of the original\", and complimented Larry Miller's performance. \"People\" gave it a B+ rating and called it a \"fun, facile remake\" with a good cast."

        "text": "Cyprus Volleyball Federation (CVF) (Greek: Kυπριακή Oμοσπονδία Πετοσφαίρισης, Κ.Ο.ΠΕ) () is the governing body of volleyball in Cyprus. It organises the first division, second division leagues and a cup competition.\nBefore the Federation's establishment.\nVolleyball first made its appearance in Cyprus in 1920 and was first included as a competitive event in the 1928 Pancyprian Games. After the World War II it was played a lot at schools and a Student Championship was established. The Local Committee of SEGAS Cyprus (SEGAS is the sports governing body of Greece) was founded in 1947 and established annual championships between the Gymnastic Clubs and then between those clubs that had a volleyball section. A representative team of Cyprus was invited in 1953 in Egypt to play against Greek and Egyptian teams of Cairo and Alexandria.\nOn November 23, 1966, the Local Committee of Cypriot Athletes was established by 15 sport clubs as a local federation of the Greek one. In 1971, the first championship took place and APOEL became the Champions. As Winners of a championship which was run by a local committee, APOEL were represented in the Greek National First Division in 1972/73 and in 1973/74 the Cypriot Champions Anorthosis Famagusta. However, Cypriot teams stop taking place in the Greek Championship after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974.\nClemersun made cyrus\nThe establishment and afterwards.\nThe sport, which was originally governed by the Greek Sports federation until 1978, became a separate entity, when the Cyprus Volleyball Federation (CVF) was established. The following clubs were the founding members of the CVF:\nAEL Limassol, Anagennisis Deryneia, Anorthosis, APOEL, Apollon Limassol, APOP Paphos, Aris Polemi, Achaeon Akti Gialoussas, Achilleas Kaimakli, E.N.P. Paralimni, Marathon Kato Varosha, Nea Salamis Famagusta, Olympiakos Nicosia, Olympias Neapolis, Olympias Frenaros, Omonia Nicosia, Omonoia Xylotympou, Pezoporikos Larnaca, Phoenix Pyla, EPA Larnaca.\nThe CVF is a member of Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) and of Confédération Européenne de Volleyball (CEV) and is responsible for representing Cyprus on the international Volleyball stage. Its headquarters are in Nicosia.\nCurrently the C.V.F. has 25 active clubs, fielding 23 teams in the men's and women's senior competitions, plus as many as 60 teams in junior and youth events. The CVF currently runs the First and Second Division Championships and Cups for both men and women and several junior competitions. The honored teams of First Division Championships and Cups represent Cyprus in European competitions. Also the Federation is responsible for all the national teams in men and women.\nBeach Volleyball in Cyprus.\nThe Beach Volley has occurred in Cyprus for the first time on the beaches of Famagusta where you gather the best volleyballers of the island mainly from Famagusta and Nicosia. Tournaments were held daily between athletes and the sport became very popular but was not through the Federation.\nThe Federation with the foundation in 1978 made several studies and tournaments started being organized by the Federation regional tournament on men and women (5X5, 3X3, 2X2 and 4X4 mixed) and then island-wide since 1987. Slowly began to be upgraded over the years with the last few years have not been anything to envy from other volleyball leagues developed countries.\nIn 1993 on the initiative of former international volleyballer Anorthosis Christos Angelides, the company H &amp; C Hotels Ltd and the Federation hosted the first unofficial international tournament ever held in Cyprus in the name of Protaras Open in 1996 and renamed Odessa International.\nIn 1996 CY.V.F. upgraded the championship tournament over Cyprus and the institution was established. The 2000 championship was given to the company \"Events One\" for five (5) years and since 2006 the Federation reorganizes the tournaments in new and better bases.\nThe Beach Volley tournament involving the best Cypriot Volleyballers surrogate partners, members of the Nat. Volleyball Teams and more, so the interest is increased and the fan turnout is any time beyond the most optimistic expectations. In 2005 Cypriot athletes participated for the first time in tournament games Small States of Europe. Due to the increased interest Beach Volley receive high visibility from the media and broadcast live the final phase.\nThe games are played on weekends from morning until night during July and August to beach volleyball courts that now exist in all towns of Cyprus. During this period there are four (4) beach volleyball tournaments held for men and two (2) for women.\nThe growth of Cyprus beach volleyball can be shown by organising the Cyprus FIVB Challenger 2006 made the Tourist Beach Geroskipou and crowned with complete success. 67 teams participated from 22 countries with prize money of $ 60 000. Paramount importance for the spread of the sport, but also the promotion of Cyprus was the third edition of the World University Championship held at the City Sports Facilities of Paralimni.\nEvery year in Yeroskipou a major event held by CEV or FIVB has been made. Meanwhile the women's national team of Cyprus has made a lot of successful showings (gold medal in GSSE, silver medal in the European u21 tournament, 7th place in Mediterranean Games, etc.) while the men's team accepted the gold medal in GSSE, the bronze medal in the CEV Satellite challenger in Yeroskipou in 2010, and the 7th position in the Mediterranean Games. Three consecutive times the Cypriot women Manolina Constantinou and Mariotta Angelopoulou have won the Greek series, which shows that the Cypriot team is one of the best in Panhellenic.\nFrom the above, the perceived high activity of the Cyprus Volleyball Federation and the efforts for further progress in our sport. The fact that every year the Cev Challenger is being held in Cyprus with more than 2.000 spectators watching the games shows how high beach volleyball is ranked among Cypriots. It has also been mentioned that in 2015 the CVF is making efforts to organise the World Tour in Paphos."

He played for Munster in the Celtic League and the Heineken Cup, and played for Cork Constitution in the All Ireland League (AIL).\nMunster.\nKelly made his Munster debut against Cardiff Blues in September 1997. He scored his first try for Munster in this game.\nHe was part of the Munster team that lost to Northampton Saints in the 2000 Heineken Cup Final, and he was again on the losing side when Munster lost to Leicester Tigers in the 2002 Heineken Cup Final.\nKelly was part of the famous Munster team that beat Gloucester in the 'Miracle Match'.

        "text": "The 1951 Giro d'Italia was the 34th edition of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The Giro started off in Milan on 19 May with a flat stage and concluded back in Milan with a relatively flat mass-start stage on 10 June. Fourteen teams entered the race, which was won by Italian Fiorenzo Magni of the Ganna team. Second and third respectively were Belgian Rik Van Steenbergen and Swiss rider Ferdinand Kübler.\nTeams.\nA total of 14 teams were invited to participate in the 1951 Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of seven riders, so the Giro began with a peloton of 98 cyclists. Italy had the most participants with 80, the foreign participation included Belgium (9), Switzerland (5), and France (4). Out of the 98 riders that started this edition of the Giro d'Italia, a total of 75 riders made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nIt was widely believed that the competing field was very international than in years past at the Giro and it contained all the great cycling champions at the moment. Reigning champion Hugo Koblet (Guerra) entered the race to defend his crown. Koblet did not have a successful early season. Fausto Coppi and his Bianchi team were regarded as the strongest team. Coppi, who had broken his collarbone earlier in the 1951 season during the Milano–Torino, had recently shown his strength as he finished second overall at the Tour de Romandie. \"Nouelliste Valaisan\" wrote the even with Gino Bartali (Bartali) and Fiorenzo Magni's (Ganna) participation, that Coppi was the only hope for an Italian victory. Bartali was seen as a rider that could surprise, but not win the race. His most notable result was a second-place finish at La Flèche Wallonne. Magni was viewed as dangerous prospect; he won Milano–Torino and his third straight Tour of Flanders in April. As a whole, the \"Big Three\" of Italian cycling were seen as the only Italian riders with legitimate chances to win the title.\nFrance's Louison Bobet (Bottecchia) was viewed as a strong candidate and in strong form. Bobet had placed third at the previous year's Tour de France, entered as the French national road race champion, and had won the Milan–San_Remo earlier that season. Swiss rider Fritz Schär (Arbos) was seen as a candidate to win the race as well. Frejus' Ferdinand Kübler, who won the 1950 Tour de France, participated as well with the hopes of winning the general classification. Kübler had a successful start to the 1951 campaign with victories at La Flèche Wallonne and Liège–Bastogne–Liège. \"Nouvelliste Valaisan\" speculated Kübler would not try to defend his Tour title in order to give the Giro his best effort. Coppi, Kubler, and Bobet were named among several media outlets to be the top contenders to win the race. The Girardengo team was viewed to be very strong, in part due to the fact the team possessed three riders with a history of winning the world championship men's road race: Marcel Kint (1938), Briek Schotte (1948 &amp; 1950), and Rik Van Steenbergen (1949). Schotte finished second at the 1948 Tour de France (Bartali won the race overall).\nRoute and stages.\nThe route was revealed on 5 February 1951. There were three rest days that divided the twenty stages. The route averaged per stage. An alternate route through the Dolomites was created by the organizers in the chances that the Pordoi Pass, Passo Rolle, and the Falzarego Pass were not cross-able. The race did exit Italy to enter Switzerland.\nThere were some rule changes prior to the 1951 edition. Due to some complaints regarding Koblet's win the year prior, which some credited due to the time bonuses he had garnered from intermediate sprints, summits, and stage finishes, all time bonuses were removed from the race. In addition, the intermediate sprint classification was removed as a whole. \"Nouvelliste Valaisan\" felt the changes would make the cyclists lose interest. In addition, rules were changed regarding flat tires, riders would have to change the inner tube rather than change wheels.\nThe opening stages and the stages between the second and third rest days were thought to be easy, while the last four stages would be the hardest. A writer for \"Nouvelliste Valaisan\" felt the Giro had begun to open more to international riders, it has drawn the attention of the Tour de France organizers. At the time it was regarded as one of the top three stage races in the world, along with the Tour de France and the Tour de Suisse.\nClassification leadership.\nThe leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nTwo additional jerseys were in use. The green jersey was given to the best foreign cyclist in the general classification; it was won by Belgian Rik Van Steenbergen. The white jersey was given to the best cyclist riding with a licence for independents; this was won by Arrigo Padovan.\nIn the mountains classification, the race organizers selected different mountains that the route crossed and awarded points to the riders who crossed them first. The winner of the team classification was determined by adding the finish times of the best three cyclists per team together and the team with the lowest total time was the winner. If a team had fewer than three riders finish, they were not eligible for the classification.\nThere was a black jersey (maglia nera) awarded to the rider placed last in the general classification. The classification was calculated in the same manner as the general classification.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run."

The Giro started off in Milan on 17 May with a flat stage and concluded back in Milan with a relatively flat mass-start stage on 8 June. Sixteen teams entered the race, which was won by Italian Fausto Coppi of the Bianchi team. Second and third respectively were Italian Fiorenzo Magni and Swiss rider Ferdinand Kübler.\nTeams.\nNineteen teams were invited by the race organizers to participate in the 1952 edition of the Giro d'Italia, but only seventeen accepted the invitation. The Paglianti team, assigned bib numbers 71 to 77, did not start, so the Giro started with sixteen teams. Each team sent a squad of seven riders, which meant that the race started with a peloton of 112 cyclists. From the riders that began the race, 98 made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nThe \"Big Three\" of Italian cycling started the race and were all seen as strong favorites to win the race. Reigning champion Fiorenzo Magni (Ganna) started the race with hopes of winning the race a third time (He also won in 1948). Three-time champion (1940, 1947, &amp; 1949) Fausto Coppi (Bianchi). Gino Bartali (Bartali) made his twelfth start at the race, with a history of winning the race three times (1936, 1937, &amp; 1946) and four second-place finishes.\nDue to the participation of several strong riders at the time, including many non-Italian riders, at the race was thought to be very competitive and the event growing into a more international event. Current Swiss road race champion and world road race champion Ferdinand Kübler (Fiorelli) started the race. Kübler entered the race after having won two of the three races comprising the Ardennes classics that took place in early May (Liège–Bastogne–Liège and La Flèche Wallonne). He was seen as a strong favorite to contend for the general classification, along with having a strong team in support. Hugo Koblet (Guerra), who won the 1950 Giro d'Italia, started the race. Attilio Camoriano of \"l'Unità\" wrote that Koblet could be a threat in the race if he was not using it as preparation for the upcoming Tour de France. The previous year's runner-up Rik Van Steenbergen and teammate Stan Ockers (Girardengo) were seen as the best Belgian entrants with general classification chances. Milan–San Remo winner Loretto Petrucci (Bianchi) was known to ride for Coppi, but there were thoughts that he would be able to attack after the Dolomites.\nThe Nilux team featured three Australian riders, who may have been the first Australian riders to participate in the race. The Torpado team featured famed Spanish riders Bernardo Ruiz and Jesús Loroño. It was noted that top French riders at the time were lacking from the race's start list, although Raphaël Géminiani (Bianchi) did participate as a support for Coppi. Géminiani had finished second at the 1951 Tour de France and had the reputation of a climber. Tour de Romandie winner Wout Wagtmans (Garin) was set to ride the Giro, but withdrew at the last moment. It was speculated to be a battle between Swiss and Italian riders.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route was revealed on 29 February 1952. The race route contained twenty stages, of which two were individual time trials, as well as three rest days. There were twelve categorized climbs that awarded points for the mountains classification across seven stages.\nThe route was thought to give chances of success to all types of riders as there were several flat stages, \"mixed\" stages, time trials, and mountainous stages. The first time trial was flat, while the second had a final that was downhill. The eleventh and nineteenth stages were seen as the most important. The eleventh leg featured three climbs as the race traveled from Venice to Bolzano and climbed the Falzarego, Pordoi Pass, and Passo Sella. Stage 19 stretched from Saint-Vincent to Verbania and featured the climbs of Great St Bernard Pass, which was the highest pass of the race at , and Simplon Pass. Camoriano wrote when the route was announced that the route was open and good for those that are \"capable and complete.\"\nClassification leadership.\nOne jersey was worn during the 1953 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nAdditionally, the highest ranked cyclist riding with a licence for independents was identified by the white jersey; at the end of the Giro this was Donato Zampini. Another classification was calculated in the same method, but was exclusive to foreign riders and awarded a green jersey.\nThe mountains classification leader wore no leader's jersey. There was one category for mountains which awarded 6, 4, 3, 2, and 1 point to the first riders to cross. Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.\nFinal standings.\nTeam classification.\nKubler was the highest ranked non-Italian rider."

        "text": " \nBaseball NT is the governing body of baseball within the Northern Territory, Australia. Baseball NT was formed in 1968 under its original name, the Northern Territory Baseball League. Baseball NT is governed nationally by the Australian Baseball Federation. Historically, baseball in Australia and the Northern Territory has been an amateur sport.\nOverview.\nOrganised baseball is played in Darwin, Alice Springs and Katherine. Darwin has four clubs; Nightcliff Tigers, Palmerston Reds, Pints and Tracy Village Rebels. The East Darwin Beasts disbanded in 1987 and the South Darwin Rabbitohs disbanded in 2004. In Darwin, baseball is a dry-season sport, played between April and September each year. Baseball in Darwin is controlled by the Darwin Baseball Association.\nThe Katherine Baseball Association has four teams; Dodgers, Cubs, Angels and Braves. The sport is usually played between the months of February through to September, during the dry season. Predominantly, only under seventeen competitions are played due to a lack of interested players. Although a high percentage of participating players are successful in making local squads and Territory/ state teams.\nAlice Springs has six teams; Bulls, Cubs, Demons, Panthers, Redbacks and Venom. In Alice Springs, baseball is a summer sport, usually played between October and March. Baseball in Alice Springs is controlled by the Alice Springs Baseball Association.\nThe Northern Territory competed in the national Claxton Shield competition between 1981 and 1989. During its nine-year admittance, the Northern Territory won only one game, in 1987, against South Australia with a score of 20–11. Bill Hutcheson, a Catcher, from originally Tennant Creek and later Darwin, was the only player to play in all nine Claxton Shields. Evan Gordon was the first Territorian to hit a home run on 16 January 1983, against NSW.\nIn 1991, the Territory joined the national Australian Provincial Championship (also known as the Commonwealth Cup) competition for regional Australian baseball. Bill Fryar became the first Territorian to hit a home run in 1992, against Queensland. In 1999, the Northern Territory won the Cup for the first time under the leadership of player/coach, Andrew Kendray.\nSuccess for the Northern Territory is difficult as promising juniors are attracted away from the Territory to pursue careers in the southern leagues where their development and opportunities are greater. Several Territorian home-grown players have gone onto successful baseball careers and these most notably include Greg Mosel, Max Hardy, Jon Mellor, Lachlan Burrows, Darren Welch, Wilson Lee, Sam Tibbits, Dushan Ruzic and Adrian Burnside. Rarely do these players return to the Northern Territory. This has created a catch 22 situation for Baseball NT whereby it understands that by developing home-grown talent, there is a good possibility these players will be lost to southern leagues, unlikely to return to the Northern Territory.\nIn November 1983 however, Territory players were selected to play for Australia against the touring Japanese Industrial League champions, Toshiba, and included, Bill Fryar, Dwayne McInnes, and Laurie Moore from Darwin; John Baldock from Tennant Creek Evan Gordon and Darren Welch from Alice Springs.\nSince the late 1990s, the popularity and standard of baseball in the Northern Territory has steadily declined as it struggles to compete against Australian icon sports such as cricket, as well as attract juniors away from the information technology revolution such as computer games and the \"hip-hop\" culture."

It also picks U14, U16 and U18 state teams and Greater Brisbane League All-Star teams, the largest competition in Queensland. It runs all regional bodies in Queensland and the far north coast of New South Wales and also controls the Queensland Umpires, Scorers and Coaches associations.\nControversy.\nIn November 2008, the Pine Rivers Rapids club announced their interest in a breakaway league from the Greater Brisbane League that Baseball Queensland runs. The controversy arose before the start of the 2008–2009 season when Pine Rivers amongst other high-profile clubs, were warned that they are in danger of not meeting GBL Major League criteria which enables them to have a team in the top three divisions of Queensland baseball. The 'mutiny' is led by club committee members, Derek Harvey and Peter Dutton, father of Australian baseballer Brad Dutton.\nThe push for a breakaway league as of December, 2008 seems to have died off with all big Greater Brisbane League clubs declaring their support for Baseball Queensland including Redcliffe Padres, Narangba Demons, Redlands Baseball Club and Pine Hills Lightning. On 31 November 2008, Rapids forfeited their 3rd Major B game of the season which according to GBL breach of forfeit rules:\nAnd without a team in Major A, B and C, a club cannot qualify for Major League criteria (see GBL Major League Criteria). This left Baseball Queensland in a compromising position whether to kick Major A leaders, Pine Rivers Rapids out of Major League or continue to be criticised by other clubs for not following through with GBL By-Laws.\nRegions.\nBaseball Queensland is split into eight regions, seven of which are active as April 2009.

Williamson was the first President and remained in office for six years.\nThe teams in the inaugural season of the Victorian Baseball League were: Carlton, Ferguson &amp; Mitchell, Fitzroy, Geelong, Kew, M.C.C., Melbourne (to be renamed Metropolitans), Richmond, Richmond C.C., St.Kilda, the \"Age\" and Victoria.\nThey were followed by South Melbourne, East Melbourne and Malvern in 1893, Essendon in 1893, Hawkesburn in 1896, and Prahran in 1897.\nVictorian Baseball Union split.\nSince before the First World War Baseball curtain-raisers to League football had been an institution. The Victorian Baseball League A-grade competition fixture was aligned with the Victorian Football Association fixture and under this system every A grade team also had the backing of a District Cricket Club with all of the resultant benefits.\nIn 1896 football in Victoria was split into two sections when eight of the thirteen Victorian Football Association (VFA) clubs (Carlton, Collingwood, Essendon, Fitzroy, Geelong, Melbourne, St Kilda and South Melbourne) broke away to form the Victorian Football League (VFL). This league soon became the dominant of the two especially given all twenty Victorian Football Association premierships to that stage had been shared by six of those eight clubs. The VFA continued to be an independent body, with only five of its original clubs (Footscray, North Melbourne, Port Melbourne, Richmond and Williamstown) – but within five years it had expanded to ten clubs, a size it maintained until the 1920s. This split had a significant impact on Victorian Baseball.\nFor several years after football split the Victorian Baseball League debated the need to restructure its constitution to recognize the split between the VFA and VFL. At each annual meeting of the VBL a portion of the business was dedicated to the allocation of teams between A and B grades, following a basic relegation and promotion system. In 1915 this meant that A Grade consisted of six teams playing on league football grounds and four on Association grounds. This caused it to be near impossible to organize a fair fixture of home and away matches matching teams with their respective football club. Further exacerbating the problem was the fact that the VFL played on better grounds to larger crowds.\nAt a special meeting of the Victoria Baseball League on 25 March 1915 the executive committee submitted a proposition to split the league into one division of \"League\" clubs and one of \"Association\" clubs. Each section was to compete for its own pennant, the winners to play one game at the end of the season to decide the championship and the right to hold the Frank Laver shield. However a sufficient majority to pass the changes to the constitution was not secured.\nA Grade delegates contended that they had little voice in the management of the League, being frequently out-voted by the B and C grade delegates. With a feeling of certainty that baseball affairs in Victoria were not controlled by the administrative officers and responsible clubs, the seceding clubs unanimously agreed that there was only one step to take. The Victorian Baseball Union was formed by Fitzroy, East Melbourne, Melbourne, South Melbourne, Carlton, Richmond, St Kilda and Collingwood. The Union included every major office holder of the Victorian Baseball League (with the exception of one member of the executive committee).\nIn 1925 the League and the Union settled their differences and amalgamated into the Victorian Baseball Association (VBA) under the Presidency of Len Johnston.\nVictorian Baseball after Football.\nBaseball curtain-raisers were discontinued in 1947 when the introduction of the VFL third eighteen eliminated baseball from League football grounds. This did allow the Victorian Baseball Association to reintroduce promotion and relegation independent of football to the competition.\nIn 1960 the VBA amalgamated A and B grades together and formed North and South division. In 1963 however, the VBA reverted to the old A and B grade system.\nIn August 1976 the Victorian Baseball Association made the major decision to change the season for the main competition to summer. This is the time of year in which the sport is played in the two major countries of America and Japan. Furthermore, all other Australian states were playing during summer and this put Victoria at a considerable disadvantage for the Australian Championships (the Claxton Shield).\nRecent history.\nIn 2006, the Victorian Baseball Association (VBA) and the Victorian Provincial Baseball League (VPBL) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The MOU was an attempt to clear the situation of having two governing bodies for baseball in Victoria. The VPBL was made of affiliated associations, predominantly based in regional centres, which scheduled competitions in the winter months (i.e. April - September). The VBA was predominantly based around the metropolitan suburbs of Melbourne and played their matches in the summer months (i.e. October - March). The VBA and the VPBL both have strong histories and heritage.\nThe unification process was further galvanised in 2009 by the establishment of a new Constitution and independent Board of Directors to run a single governing body for Victorian baseball, to be known as Baseball Victoria. It was hoped that the unification process would guarantee the growth and management of baseball in Victoria. The conduct, and therefore costs associated with the previous VPBL competitions remained the jurisdiction of the various associations.\nFeatures of a unified model would be the full establishment of statewide programs, operating in all areas of Melbourne and Country Victoria and working with all clubs regardless of historical ties to VBA or VPBL.\nBaseball Victoria is responsible for selecting the Victoria Aces team that competed in the Claxton Shield; an annual, national baseball competition currently contested between the five mainland states of Australia. Baseball Victoria also governs all levels of baseball in the state, and directly runs the State Summer League (renamed the Baseball Victoria Summer League in 2010), considered to be the top level of competition in the state and the source of the majority of Australian-based players selected for the Victoria Aces.\nVictorian Baseball Today.\nBaseball in Victoria is played all year round with two seasons - Summer and Winter.\nSummer Baseball in Victoria.\nSummer Baseball is conducted between October and March. The Baseball Victoria Summer League (BVSL) has the direct authority over the competitions conducted within the summer season, with Baseball Victoria providing umbrella support. Competition matches are generally played within the metropolitan areas of Melbourne.\nBaseball Victoria Summer League.\nThe Baseball Victoria Summer League was formed in 2010 by Baseball Victoria and replaced the former Victorian State League and the Vodafone State League. Baseball Victoria rebranded the competition to comprise mainstream men’s, women’s, junior and Masters competitions.\nWinter Baseball in Victoria.\nWinter Baseball is conducted between April and September. Regionally based Associations have the direct authority over the competitions conducted within the winter season, with Baseball Victoria providing umbrella support to other baseball activities, such as development and high performance programs.\nVictorian Baseball during the winter is played across eight Leagues and Associations. Each League and Association is responsible for the competitions within their local areas.\nBaseball Victoria also stage the State Winter Championships which matches representative teams from each League and Association. While being competitive is a high priority, it is just as important to have fun and enjoy a weekend of baseball in a relaxed environment.\nMelbourne Winter Baseball League.\nThe Melbourne Winter Baseball League, formerly the Victorian Winter Baseball League, is the biggest winter baseball league in Victoria. It is run by Baseball Victoria as of 2010 after it took control from the VPBL after a Memorandum of Understanding. There are 25 different clubs, fielding teams in five grades from A to E. Every Grade has a reserves as well.\nThe Melbourne Winter Baseball League is made up from two leagues. One being the Ringwood District Baseball League and the other, Diamond Valley Baseball League. This is more important for juniors as junior teams only play teams in their own district. Except for under 17s where both districts play each other. At the state winter championships these two districts play against each other\nGeelong Winter Baseball League.\nThe Geelong Winter League, is run by the Geelong Baseball Association (GBA) and based in Geelong, Victoria. The GBA is affiliated with Baseball Victoria.\nEstablished in 1937, the GBA offers senior and junior competitions to clubs and teams from metropolitan Geelong, Colac, Werribee, Bacchus Marsh, Lara, Newport and Ballarat. Competition is conducted from early April through to September."

        "text": "The 1953 Giro d'Italia was the 36th edition of the Giro d'Italia. The Giro started off in Milan on 12 May with a flat stage and concluded back in Milan with a relatively flat mass-start stage on 2 June. Sixteen teams entered the race, which was won by Italian Fausto Coppi of the Bianchi team. Second and third respectively were Swiss rider Hugo Koblet and Italian Pasquale Fornara.\nHugo Koblet held the pink jersey up until the penultimate stage, when Coppi attacked and left him behind on the climb up the Stelvio Pass (included in the Giro for the first time), taking the lead and securing the final victory. Since then the Stelvio Pas is par excellence the Cima Coppi of the competition.\nTeams.\nSixteen teams were invited by the race organizers to participate in the 1953 edition of the Giro d'Italia. Like the Tour de France the teams were nation based for the first time at the Giro, with each national team being sponsored by an Italian brand. Each team sent a squad of seven riders, which meant that the race started with a peloton of 112 cyclists. From the riders that began the race, 72 made it to the finish in Milan. In total there were 35 foreign riders that started the race. \nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nThe \"Big Three\" of Gino Bartali (Bartali), Fausto Coppi (Bianchi), and Fiorenzo Magni (Ganna) were expected to dominate the general classification. A \"La Liberté\" writer felt that young riders Giancarlo Astrua (Atala), Nino Defilippis (Legnano), Pasquale Fornara (Bottecchia), and climber Bruno Monti (Arbos) would be exciting to watch throughout the race to see their potential. French rider and Swiss riders were thought to be very strong, while Spanish riders Bernardo Ruiz and Michel Gual were thought to be their country's best riders. Swiss rider and former Giro winner Hugo Koblet (Cilo) was regarded as being in sensational form entering the Giro, coming off a win at the Tour de Romandie. Taking that into account with his good health, the media felt Koblet could be the one to challenge Coppi best. \nA notable absence from the race was Bianchi rider Loretto Petrucci who had won the previous two Milan–San Remo, who was not brought to the race because of his young age according to his team; however, he had previously raced in 1951 and 1952. A \"La Sentinelle\" writer believed that Petrucci's omission from the race was due to Petrucci's desire to race for victories and not for the team leader Coppi.\nRoute and stages.\nOn 26 March, the route was announced to be from 12 May to 28 May. It was later rumored on 30 March, that the race may include the Olympic stadium. The full route was later unveiled on 9 April 1953, with a changed finale on the 2 June. The race route featured 20 days of racing spread across 22 days as 20 May in Pisa and 27 May in San Pellegrino were set aside as rest days.\nRace overview.\nThe race started outside the Piazza del Duomo in Milan. Ferdinand Kubler withdrew from the race early on due to disputes.\nClassification leadership.\nThe leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro. Time bonuses were awarded to the stage winner and the first riders to summit categorized climbs. Riders were allowed to have teammates and team cars help to following accidents and punctures. \"Strollers\" in years past were punished with small fines, but in this edition of the race they were punished by time adjustments and repeat offenses may lead to disqualification from the race. The winner of the race received 1 million lire, while the remainder of the podium received 450,000 lire each.\nTwo additional jerseys were in use. The green jersey was given to the best foreign cyclist in the general classification; at the end of the Giro it was worn by Swiss Hugo Koblet. The white jersey was given to the best cyclist riding with a licence for independents; this was won by Angelo Conterno. The winner of each classification earned 500,000 lire.\nThe mountains classification leader was not identified by a special jersey. The climbs all awarded three points to the first rider and one point to the second rider to cross the summit. There was one category for mountains which awarded five points down to one point for the first riders to cross the summit. The winner of the mountains classification was given 400,000 lire. Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time. The team winning team received 2.5 million lire.\nEach day leading the general classification earned the rider and his team 100,000 lira, while the independent rider and foreign rider earned 25,000 lira each day for leading their respective classifications."

        "title": "2007 World Series",
        "text": "The 2007 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2007 season. The 103rd edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the National League (NL) champion Colorado Rockies and the American League (AL) champion Boston Red Sox; the Red Sox swept the Rockies in four games. It was the Rockies' only appearance in a World Series. The Red Sox's victory was their second World Series championship in four seasons and their seventh overall; it also marked the third sweep in four years by the AL champions. The series began on Wednesday, October 24 and ended on Sunday, October 28.\nTerry Francona became the second Red Sox manager to win two World Series titles, following Bill Carrigan, who won the 1915 and 1916 World Series. Including the last three games of the AL Championship Series, the Red Sox outscored their opposition 59–15 over their final seven games. Francona also became the first manager to win his first 8 World Series games. The Rockies, meanwhile, became the first NL team to get swept in a World Series after sweeping the League Championship Series, and just the second team ever to suffer such a fate, following the Oakland Athletics in 1990. This fate would again be suffered by the 2012 Detroit Tigers, being swept by the San Francisco Giants in the World Series after sweeping the New York Yankees in the ALCS. As of 2023, this remains the most recent time an American League team has swept a National League team in the World Series.\nBackground.\nThis was the fourth time since the beginning of interleague play in 1997 that a World Series matchup would be a rematch from the regular season. The Rockies beat the Red Sox 2-1 in a three game series at Fenway Park from June 12–14.\nThe Rockies entered the Series having won 21 of their last 22 games, going back to the end of the regular season, including sweeps of the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLDS and the division rival Arizona Diamondbacks in the NLCS. They also beat the San Diego Padres in the NL Wild Card tie-breaker. The Red Sox swept the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the ALDS and defeated the Cleveland Indians in the ALCS after trailing three games to one, taking the final three contests by a combined score of 30–5. Neither participating team was in the previous year's postseason. The Rockies' eight-day layoff was the longest in MLB postseason history, caused by their sweep in the NLCS, the ALCS going seven games, and scheduling by MLB.\nPer the 2006 Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Red Sox had home-field advantage in the World Series following the American League's 5–4 win in the 2007 All-Star Game. The first two games took place in Boston, with games 3 and 4 in Denver.\nTicket controversy.\nOn October 17, 2007, a week before the first game of the World Series, the Colorado Rockies announced that tickets would be made available to the general public via online sales only, despite prior arrangements to sell the tickets at local retail outlets. Five days later, California-based ticket vendor Paciolan, Inc., the sole contractor authorized by the Colorado Rockies to distribute tickets, was forced to suspend sales after less than an hour due to an exorbitant number of purchase attempts.\nThe Rockies organization said that they were the victims of a denial-of-service attack. The FBI started its own investigation into these claims. Ticket sales resumed the next day, with all three home games selling out within hours.\nThe Red Sox also relied primarily on online sales to sell the game tickets, although some Fenway Park tickets were sold on the phone and at the box office. The Sox held a random drawing for the right to buy post season tickets on October 15, and winners bought tickets at a private online sale. Street prices were lower in Boston this time than in 2004: the average price, according to StubHub, was about $1500 in 2007, down about $300 from three years previously. Some Sox fans found that it was cheaper to travel to Denver to see World Series games than to pay the street price for Boston game tickets.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nThe Red Sox cruised to a blowout win in Game 1 behind ALCS MVP Josh Beckett, who struck out nine batters, including the first four he faced, over seven innings en route to his fourth win of the 2007 postseason. Mike Timlin and Éric Gagné pitched a perfect eighth and ninth, respectively.\nBoston Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski threw the ceremonial first pitch, as he had done before Game 1 in 2004. Rookie Dustin Pedroia led off the Sox' first inning with a home run over the Green Monster in Fenway Park off of Jeff Francis. Pedroia's homer was only the second lead-off home run to start a World Series (the only other one was hit by Baltimore's Don Buford in 1969). Kevin Youkilis then doubled to right, moved to third on David Ortiz's groundout, and scored on Manny Ramirez's single. After Mike Lowell flew out, Jason Varitek singled before J. D. Drew doubled to score Ramirez and make it 3-0 Red Sox.\nThe Rockies got on the board in the second when Garrett Atkins doubled with one out off Beckett and scored on Troy Tulowitzki's double one out later, but the Red Sox got that run back off of Francis when Youkilis walked with two outs and scored on Ortiz's double. In the fourth, the Red Sox loaded the bases with two outs on a single, double, and intentional walk when Varitek's two-run double put them up 6–1.\nThey put the game out of reach with seven runs in the fifth. Julio Lugo hit a leadoff single off of reliever Franklin Morales before Jacoby Ellsbury bunted into a forceout at second. After Pedroia popped out, a balk moved Ellsbury to second before he scored on Youkilis's double. Ortiz's double and Ramirez's single scored a run each. The Red Sox loaded the bases on a double and walk before Drew's single scored another run. Ryan Speier relieved Morales and walked all three batters he faced to force in three more Boston runs. Matt Herges relieved Speier and got Youkilis to fly out to right to end the inning.\nThough Herges and two relievers held Boston scoreless for the rest of the game, the Red Sox finished with 13 runs, the most ever in a World Series Game 1, and tied another record with nine extra base hits. The last 11 of the Red Sox runs came with two outs.\nGame 2.\nThe ceremonial first pitch was thrown by Andrew Madden, a 13-year-old heart transplant recipient, accompanied by Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame member Dwight Evans. After the debacle of Game 1, Colorado appeared to return to form, scoring quickly on a groundout by Todd Helton with runners on second and third in the first. However, this would be the only time the Rockies ever led in the series as postseason veteran Curt Schilling ( IP, one run, four hits) and Boston's bullpen (Okajima, IP; Papelbon, IP) allowed no other runs in the contest. The Red Sox tied the game in the fourth off of Ubaldo Jimenez on Jason Varitek's sacrifice fly with runners on second and third, then took the lead next inning on Mike Lowell's RBI double with runners on first and second. Matt Holliday had four of Colorado's five hits in Game 2, including a base hit off Papelbon with two outs in the eighth. Before throwing another pitch, Papelbon caught Holliday leaning too far off first base and picked him off—Papelbon's first career pickoff.\nGame 3.\nThis was the first World Series game ever played in Colorado. At 4 hours 19 minutes, it became the longest nine-inning game in World Series history. Game 3 was also the 600th World Series game ever played. Starting pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka pitched five innings of scoreless ball and left in the sixth with no runs allowed. The Red Sox struck first with a six-run third inning. Rookie Jacoby Ellsbury hit a leadoff double, moved to third on Dustin Pedroia's single, and scored on David Ortiz's double. After Manny Ramirez was intentionally walked, Mike Lowell's single scored two more runs. J. D. Drew popped out before Ramirez was thrown out at home on Jason Varitek's single with Lowell advancing to third. After Julio Lugo walked to load the bases, Matsuzaka hit a two-run single for his first base hit and RBI in the Major Leagues. Ellsbury capped the scoring with his second double of the inning to knock Colorado starter Josh Fogg out of the game. The Rockies' bats came to life in the sixth and seventh innings against a normally-solid but now-shaky Boston bullpen. After Matsuzaka walked two straight in the sixth with one out, reliever Javier López allowed back-to-back RBI singles to Brad Hawpe and Yorvit Torrealba. Mike Timlin allowed two straight leadoff singles in the seventh before NLCS MVP Matt Holliday brought the Rockies to within one run with a three-run home run off Hideki Okajima. Brian Fuentes gave back those runs in the eighth by walking Lugo with one out and allowing a subsequent single to Coco Crisp before Ellsbury and Dustin Pedroia, who had four and three hits, respectively, on the night (the first time in World Series history two rookies had at least three hits in a game) hit back-to-back RBI doubles, raising Boston's lead to 9–5. Jonathan Papelbon came on for a four-out save, getting Holliday to fly out on one pitch, leaving runners on first and second. Jason Varitek would tack on Boston's tenth run in the top of the ninth off of LaTroy Hawkins with a sacrifice fly, scoring Mike Lowell who, not generally considered a stolen base threat, had just stolen third base—the first time a Red Sox baserunner stole third base in the World Series since 1975—after hitting a leadoff single and moving to second on a sacrifice bunt. Papelbon came back out in the bottom of the ninth to complete the save, getting the first two outs before surrendering a two-out triple to Brad Hawpe, then finishing the game with a groundout from Yorvit Torrealba. The Red Sox took Game 3 by a final score of 10–5.\nThe Red Sox continued to set World Series records during Game 3:\nGame 4.\nThe Red Sox struck early. Rookie Jacoby Ellsbury began the first inning with a double and was advanced by Dustin Pedroia with a groundout, followed by an RBI single from David Ortiz. In the seventh inning, series MVP Mike Lowell hit a home run to give Boston a 3–0 lead and knock starter Aaron Cook out of the game. Lowell also hit a leadoff double in the fifth and scored on Jason Varitek's single. The Colorado offense answered when left fielder Brad Hawpe hit a home run off of a Manny Delcarmen fastball, bringing the Rockies within two. Relief pitcher Brian Fuentes gave back that run abruptly, allowing Boston pinch-hitter Bobby Kielty to hit a ball into the left field stands on the first pitch of the inning, extending the Red Sox lead to 4–1. In the bottom of the inning Boston pitcher Hideki Okajima allowed a one-out single to Todd Helton followed by a Garrett Atkins two-run home run, bringing the Rockies within one. Jonathan Papelbon relieved Okajima and earned his third save of the series. At 12:06 a.m. EDT on Monday, October 29, Papelbon struck out Colorado pinch hitter Seth Smith for the final out of the 2007 season. Boston had won its second World Series title in four years and seventh all-time.\nThere was controversy in the top of the eighth when Fox's broadcast announced that Alex Rodriguez would be opting out of his contract with the Yankees to become a free agent. Commissioner Bud Selig made it clear during the World Series that an embargo had been placed on all Major League Baseball stories until the sport's top event had come to an end. Rodriguez and his agent Scott Boras would later apologize for the incident.\nThe Rockies became the third team in Series history (the 1937 Yankees and 1966 Orioles were the others) not to commit an error in a World Series of any length. They were the first team to do so while losing the World Series.\nComposite line score.\n2007 World Series (4–0): Boston Red Sox (A.L.) beat Colorado Rockies (N.L.).\nSeries Statistics.\nBoston Red Sox.\nBatting.\n\"Note: GP=Games Played; AB=At Bats; R=Runs; H=Hits; 2B=Doubles; 3B=Triples; HR=Home Runs; RBI=Runs Batted In; BB=Walks; AVG=Batting Average; OBP=On Base Percentage; SLG=Slugging Percentage\"\nPitching.\n\"Note: G=Games Played; GS=Games Started; IP=Innings Pitched; H=Hits; BB=Walks; R=Runs; ER=Earned Runs; SO=Strikeouts; W=Wins; L=Losses; SV=Saves; ERA=Earned Run Average\"\nColorado Rockies.\nBatting.\n\"Note: GP=Games Played; AB=At Bats; R=Runs; H=Hits; 2B=Doubles; 3B=Triples; HR=Home Runs; RBI=Runs Batted In; BB=Walks; AVG=Batting Average; OBP=On Base Percentage; SLG=Slugging Percentage\"\nPitching.\n\"Note: G=Games Played; GS=Games Started; IP=Innings Pitched; H=Hits; BB=Walks; R=Runs; ER=Earned Runs; SO=Strikeouts; W=Wins; L=Losses; SV=Saves; ERA=Earned Run Average\"\nCelebration.\nWhile the celebratory crowd at Kenmore Square was not as unruly as in 2004, cars were overturned and 37 arrests were made. The Red Sox victory parade, yet again in duck boats and called a \"Rolling Rally\" as in 2004, was on October 30, 2007 with closer Jonathan Papelbon doing his infamous \"Irish Jig\" while local punk band the Dropkick Murphys played their hit \"I'm Shipping Up to Boston\".\nThe Red Sox World Series win in 2007 continued the success of Boston-area teams in recent years. The Celtics won their 17th championship, their first championship since , the last time the Red Sox lost in the World Series, months later. Furthermore, the New England Patriots had victories in 2001, 2003, 2004, 2014, 2016 and 2018, the Boston Bruins in , and the Red Sox three years earlier in and six years later in and five years after that in .\nBroadcasting.\nThe World Series was televised by Fox in the United States, with Joe Buck and Tim McCarver as booth announcers. The starting time for each television broadcast was 8:00 pm EDT (6:00 pm MDT). The series broke with the recent tradition of starting the World Series on a Saturday, as Major League Baseball had become convinced that weekend games drew lower television ratings. Prior to this season, every World Series since 1985 had opened on a Saturday, with the exception of the 1990 World Series. This was the first World Series to start on a Wednesday since 1968.\nRogers Sportsnet (RSN) in Canada used the MLB International feed with Dave O'Brien and Rick Sutcliffe as booth announcers. NASN showed the games live to most of Europe, while in the UK, all games were shown terrestrially on Five. NHK aired the Series in Japan.\nOn radio, the Series was broadcast nationally by ESPN Radio, with Jon Miller and Joe Morgan announcing. Locally, Joe Castiglione and Glenn Geffner called the Series for the Red Sox on WRKO in Boston, while Jack Corrigan and Jeff Kingery called it for the Rockies on KOA in Denver. Per contractual obligation, the non-flagship stations on the teams' radio networks carried the ESPN Radio broadcasts.\nAftermath.\nRed Sox.\nAs previously mentioned, the Red Sox won two more World Series titles in 2013 and 2018. Both of those titles were managed by two members of the 2007 club. Pitching coach John Farrell served as the skipper of the 2013 Red Sox, featuring 2007 holdovers Clay Buchholz (DNP), Jacoby Ellsbury, Jon Lester, David Ortiz, and Dustin Pedroia. The 2018 Red Sox was managed by Alex Cora, an infielder on the 2007 team.\nThe Red Sox finished as a wild-card team in the 2008 season, winning 95 games. They were defeated in the ALCS by the Tampa Bay Rays in seven games. The Red Sox again qualified as a 95-win wild-card team in 2009, but lost 3–0 to the Los Angeles Angels in the ALDS. In both 2010 and 2011, the Red Sox missed the postseason despite winning 89 and 90 games, respectively. The 2011 season saw the Red Sox hold a nine-game lead in the wild card heading to September, only to lose 13 of their final 20 games to miss the playoffs. This led to the dismissal of skipper Terry Francona.\nRockies.\nAfter making the World Series in 2007, the Rockies proceeded to appear in the playoffs only three times in the next 15 seasons. In 2009, the Rockies won a wild-card berth after winning 92 games, but in a rematch of the 2007 NLDS, the Rockies lost in four games to the Philadelphia Phillies. During that season, the Rockies fired Clint Hurdle and replaced him with Jim Tracy. The Rockies never finished higher than third place in the NL West between 2010 and 2017, though in the latter season, they returned to postseason play as a second wild-card team. There, the Rockies lost in the Wild Card Game to the Arizona Diamondbacks. The following season, the Rockies made consecutive postseason appearances for the first time in team history, winning the Wild Card Game against the Chicago Cubs, but losing in the NLDS to the Milwaukee Brewers 3–0.\nAfter managing the Rockies, Hurdle was hired by the Pittsburgh Pirates in , and in 2013, ended a major North American professional sports record 20-year drought without a winning season. The Pirates proceeded to make the postseason three consecutive years under Hurdle, winning the 2013 National League Wild Card Game during that span.\nThree members of the 2007 Rockies went on to win a World Series ring with other teams. Outfielder Matt Holliday won in with the St. Louis Cardinals, pitcher Jeremy Affeldt won in , and with the San Francisco Giants, and pitcher Franklin Morales won in 2013 with the Red Sox, and in with the Kansas City Royals."

        "text": "Jason Dewande Bell (born April 1, 1978) is an American former professional football player who was a cornerback in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys, Houston Texans and New York Giants. Bell played college football for the UCLA Bruins.\nEarly life.\nBell was born on April 1, 1978, in Long Beach, California, to parents Cortland and Geraldine Bell. He attended Robert A.

        "text": "1909 was the 20th season of County Championship cricket in England and featured a Test series between England and Australia. Kent won the championship and Australia, captained by Monty Noble, won the Test series.\nEvents.\nThe season was the first in which W. G. Grace had not played a first-class match since 1864. It saw Wiltshire win their second Minor Counties Championship title and the formation of the Imperial Cricket Council, which was later renamed as the International Cricket Council, in London with Australia, England and South Africa as the founding members.\nTest series.\nMonty Noble's Australian tourists played 42 first-class matches, including a five Test series to contest The Ashes. Matches included five played in Scotland, including one match against Scotland, one in Ireland against SH Cochrane's XI, and one in Wales against a South Wales team. They lost just four matches on the tour.\nThe Test series was won 2–1 by Australia with two matches drawn. England, captained by Archie MacLaren, won the first Test at Edgbaston after an Australian first-innings batting collapse on a wet pitch, with Colin Blythe and George Hirst bowling almost unchanged, taking all 20 Australian wickets. The second and third Tests, played at Lord's and Headingley respectively, were Australian victories with the final two Tests at Old Trafford and The Oval drawn. The final match of the series saw the only Test match appearance by Douglas Carr at the age of 37. Carr became the first man to play for England having made his first-class debut earlier in the same season.\nCounty Championship.\nKent won their second County Championship title, playing 26 matches with 16 wins and only two losses during the season. Lancashire finished in second place whilst the 1908 winners Yorkshire finished in third. Gloucestershire finished last of the 16 counties which competed in the Championship, with only one win to their name.\nAfter the Championship season was completed there were calls for a move to a two division system. These calls led nowhere in the short term, although for the 1911 County Championship a new system of awarding points was introduced.\nStatistics.\nTed Arnold and William Burns set a then world record fifth-wicket partnership of 393 runs for Worcestershire against Warwickshire. Kent's Frank Woolley and Arthur Fielder set a record of 235 runs for the tenth-wicket against Worcestershire, an English first-class record which still stands as of 2016.\nBatting statistics.\nThe batsmen with the highest runs aggregate in 1909 were:\nJack Mason topped the batting averages with 783 runs at an average of 65.25 from 14 innings.

        "title": "1940 to 1944 English cricket seasons",
        "text": "All first-class cricket was cancelled in the 1940 to 1944 English cricket seasons because of the Second World War; no first-class matches were played in England after Friday, 1 September 1939 until Saturday, 19 May 1945.\nTen matches were cancelled at the end of the 1939 English cricket season due to the German invasion of Poland on 1 September and the British government's declaration of war against Germany on Sunday 3 September.\nAlthough eleven first-class matches were arranged during the 1945 season following the final defeat of Germany in early May, it was not until the 1946 season that normal fixtures, including the County Championship and Minor Counties Championship, could resume. In contrast with much of the First World War, it was realised in the 1940s that cricket had its part to play in terms of raising both public morale and funds for charity. Efforts were made to stage matches whenever opportunity arose, especially if a suitable number of top players could be assembled. From the summer of 1941 onwards, teams such as the British Empire Eleven toured the country raising money for war charities.\nAt league cricket level, playing one-day matches, many competitions continued throughout the war: e.g., the Birmingham League, the Bradford League and the Lancashire League.\nSuccessful wartime players included Laurie Fishlock, Eric Hollies and Eddie Paynter.\n1940.\nIn the 1940 \"Wisden\", the cricket author H S Altham described his “sobering experience” when he visited Lord's the previous December. He said:\nAltham reflected the popular (and official) view that \"the game can and should be kept going whenever possible\".\nOne venue where it would not be possible was The Oval, which was commandeered in 1939 and quickly turned into a prisoner of war camp, except that no prisoners were ever interned there. The playing area became a maze of concrete posts and wire fences.\nLord's was also due for requisition but it was spared and MCC was able to stage many public schools and representative games throughout the war. A highlight in 1940 was the one-day game in which Sir PF Warner’s XI, including Len Hutton and Denis Compton (who top-scored with 73), beat a West Indies XI which included Learie Constantine and Leslie Compton (an honorary West Indian for the day).\nOf the more regular wartime teams, the most famous were the British Empire XI and the London Counties XI which were established in 1940. Both played one-day charity matches, mostly in the south-east and often at Lord’s. The British Empire XI was founded by Pelham Warner but featured mainly English county players. The politician Desmond Donnelly, then in the Royal Air Force, began the London Counties XI. In one match between the two, Frank Woolley came out of retirement and played against the new star batsman Denis Compton. The British Empire XI played between 34 and 45 matches per season from 1940 to 1944; the London Counties XI was credited with 191 matches from 1940 to 1945.\nAlthough the teams were successful in raising money for charity, their main purpose was to help sustain morale. Many of the services and civil defence organisations had their own teams, some of them national and featuring first-class players.\nCounty clubs encouraged their players to join the services but at the same time pleaded with their members to continue subscriptions “as an investment for the future”. While some counties (notably Somerset and Hampshire) closed for the duration, others did arrange matches. Nottinghamshire played six matches at Trent Bridge in 1940 and Lancashire mooted a scheme for a regionalised county competition to include the minor counties, but it was not taken further.\n1941.\nFrom 1941 to 1945 the University Match was played annually at Lord's as a one-day, and hence not first-class, game. Because Fenner's had not been commandeered, Cambridge had played nine matches during the 1941 season against Sussex and strong military and hospital teams and won four against a single defeat, whereas Oxford had played no cricket whatsoever due to The Parks being commandeered. Consequently, Cambridge were expected to and did win the match and were to win easily all but one of the subsequent one-day University Matches. Cambridge's most famous player was John Bridger, who played after the war for Hampshire with considerable success.\nIn public school cricket, a future champion in Trevor Bailey demonstrated his latterly-famous defensive skill for Dulwich College by scoring 851 runs in fifteen innings – in only seven of which was he dismissed. Dulwich also had the best school bowler in Horace Kiddle, who took fifty wickets for 7.86 runs each but was killed in action in 1944 before World War II ended, whilst future Worcestershire bowler George Chesterton of Malvern took 45 wickets for 12.88 runs each, but could not make the \"Wisden\" editors best school eleven. Edward Spooner, a son of famous Marlborough and Lancashire batsman Reggie, averaged 49.50 for Eton and was tipped for a big future, but was never to play first-class cricket at all.\nThe British Empire XI was dominated by West Indian leg-spinner Bertie Clarke – exempt from military service because of his profession as a doctor – whose leg-breaks and googlies took 98 wickets for 11.40 runs apiece and was to better this record in 1942. In contrast, the main players for the London Counties XI were veterans, with Alf Gover their most successful bowler with 83 wickets for 9.50.\n1942.\nAs the war grew more intense, Lord's was still able to expand its profits, with 1942 described as “the best wartime season Lord’s has had”. Jack Robertson came to prominence with an innings of 102 for the Army against the Royal Navy\nEddie Paynter scored 970 runs at an average of 138.50 for Keighley in the Bradford League, whist Bailey took 52 wickets for Dulwich at 6.16 runs apiece to follow up his high-class batting from the previous season. Essex veteran Jack O’Connor scored 208 – the only double-century in wartime cricket – in a two-day match on 4 and 5 July against Peterborough. whilst Clarke surpassed his 1942 record for the Empire XI. In public school cricket, the most significant discovery was Nigel Howard of Rossall School, who scored 456 runs at an average of 45 and took twenty-four cheap wickets, whilst future Derbyshire captain Donald Carr made his debut for Repton as a spin bowler.\n1943.\nA drawn one-day match at Lord's between an England XI and a West Indies XI featured the young Alec Bedser and Trevor Bailey. Bedser made his mark by taking 6/27 in the West Indies first innings. In the drawn Sir PF Warner's XI v Royal Australian Air Force match at Lord's, Keith Miller top-scored in the RAAF's first innings, with 45 out of 100, as well as taking 2/20. The RAAF won a two-day match against The South at Hove by ten wickets. A strong England XI beat The Dominions by 8 runs in a two-day match at Lord's. Les Ames made 133 in the England first innings, and Denis Compton then took 6/15 in eight overs. In their second innings, The Dominions came close to snatching an unlikely victory, with Stewie Dempster making 113.\n1944.\nAt Lord's, two one-day matches were played by an England XI against “West Indies” and “Australia”, England winning both matches. (These were not limited overs matches.) Jack Young, unknown before the war but later to win two County Championships for Middlesex, took 88 wickets for London Counties XI at 7.63 runs apiece."

He served as the head football coach at the University of Missouri (1920–1921), Purdue University (1922–1929), the University of Washington (1930–1941), and Saint Mary's College of California (1942–1947), compiling a career college football record of 137–87–14.\nPhelan also coached the Los Angeles Dons of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) from 1948 to 1949, the New York Yanks and Dallas Texans of the National Football League (NFL) in 1951 and 1952, tallying a professional football coaching record of 13-35-2. In addition, he was the head basketball coach at Saint Mary's for two seasons during World War II (1943–1945), where he amassed a record 10–11. Phelan played college football as a quarterback at the University of Notre Dame from 1915 to 1917. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1973.\nPlaying career.\nAfter growing up in Portland, Oregon, Phelan went to Notre Dame in 1915. In his first game as a reserve quarterback and placekicker for the football team, he threw for a touchdown and ran for another in a 32–0 victory over Alma College. This earned him the starting job, and he would go on to complete a 7–1 season, the lone defeat was by one point at Nebraska.\nThe 1916 team was a defensive juggernaut, shutting out every team it played except for its meeting with Army, which it lost 30–10, thus finishing the season 8–1. The 1917 campaign began with a 55–0 victory over Kalamazoo, followed by a scoreless tie at Wisconsin, in which Phelan attempted to win the game by kicking a 61-yard field goal; the ball bounced off the crossbar. A 7–0 loss at Nebraska the following week was the last game of his career, as he was drafted into military service for World War I and sent to Camp Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky.\nCoaching career.\nFollowing the war, Phelan entered the college coaching ranks. From 1920 to 1921, he coached at Missouri, and compiled a 13–3 record. From 1922 to 1929, he coached at Purdue, and compiled a 35–22–4 record there. From 1930 to 1941, he coached at Washington in Seattle, and compiled a 65–37–9 record there.\nFollowing a six-year stint as head coach of Saint Mary's (CA) that included two bowl appearances, Phelan joined the coaching staff of three professional football franchises, including a two-year stint as the head coach of the Los Angeles Dons and one season as head coach of the NFL's Dallas Texans in 1952.\nPhelan was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1973."

        "text": "1965 was the 66th season of County Championship cricket in England. It was the first season since the 1912 Triangular Tournament in which England played Test series against two touring sides. In the first half of a damp summer, New Zealand were the tourists, and England won all three matches. The South African side that toured in the second half of the season were much tougher opposition. South Africa won that three-match series 1–0, with two matches drawn. It was the last tour of England by a South African team until 1993. Fred Trueman's international career ended, although he did not retire from first-class cricket until the end of the 1968 season. Worcestershire won their second consecutive Championship title.\nTest series.\nFor the first time since the 1912 Triangular Tournament, England hosted two series in one season. The visitors were New Zealand and South Africa, who played three Tests each against England. It became the last South African Test series against England for over 25 years because of increasing opposition to South Africa's apartheid policy.\nEngland were far too strong for New Zealand, winning all three matches, John Edrich scoring 310* in the final match at Headingley. He put on 369 with Ken Barrington for the second wicket. This was the culmination of a remarkable run of form for Edrich. In nine successive innings (the first eight being for Surrey) he scored 139, 121*, 205*, 55, 96, 188, 92, 105 and 310*.\nSouth Africa, a young and improving side, were a far tougher proposition. Their players included Graeme Pollock and his brother Peter, Colin Bland and Eddie Barlow. South Africa won the series 1–0, with two matches drawn, thanks to the Pollock brothers, who were mainly responsible for their win by 94 runs in the second Test at Trent Bridge. In overcast conditions, ideal for Tom Cartwright in particular, Graeme scored 125 out of 160 in 140 minutes, the last 91 coming in 70 minutes. He had come in at 16–2, and the score had declined to 80–5, before his partnerships with the captain, Peter van der Merwe, and Richard Dumbrill enabled the score to reach 269. He made another 59 in the second innings. His brother contributed bowling figures of 5–53 and 5–34."

There was a complete contrast to the previous sunlit summer with its record-breaking run-getting: this time the summer was exceptionally cool and wet, resulting in the dominance of bowlers with many records for wicket-taking set.\nAustralia toured England to compete for the Ashes. It was the 12th test series between the two sides.\nAfter a run of disastrous results over a number of seasons, Derbyshire was demoted from first-class status and first-class county cricket was now played by only eight teams: Gloucestershire, Kent, Lancashire, Middlesex, Notts, Surrey, Sussex and Yorkshire. Derbyshire recovered first-class status in 1894 and rejoined the Championship in 1895.\nAshes tour.\nThe sixth Australia team, under the captaincy of Percy McDonnell, toured England in 1888. The great team of 1882 under Billy Murdoch had largely disintegrated, and under McDonnell, the team was largely dependent on the sensational bowling of Turner and Ferris. Their overall record of nineteen victories and fourteen defeats was a minor improvement on the 1886 team, but the absence of Giffen weakened the batting in an exceptionally wet summer, whilst the support bowlers to Turner and Ferris, including the veteran Harry Boyle, were used so little that they could never get into form. When the weather improved after a dreadful mid-summer, the batting was much too poor to compete with England and the team's results deteriorated with thrashings in the last two Test matches and poor results against the counties.\nThanks mainly to the bowling of Bobby Peel, well supported by Lohmann, Briggs and Barnes, England defeated Australia two tests to one to retain the Ashes.\nNotes.\nAn unofficial seasonal title sometimes proclaimed by consensus of media and historians prior to December 1889 when the official County Championship was constituted. Although there are ante-dated claims prior to 1873, when residence qualifications were introduced, it is only since that ruling that any quasi-official status can be ascribed.\nBetween 1887 and 1889 an unofficial point system of 1 point for a win and 0.5 points for a draw, devised by the \"Cricket Reporting Agency\", was used to determine the unofficial \"Champion County\""

The following season, Spain replaced Ireland for two seasons.\nIn 2001–02 the women's Six Nations competition was born with England, France, Ireland, Scotland, Spain and Wales playing, after Ireland rejoined the competition. Spain, at that time, were higher ranked than Italy and therefore deserved their place in the competition on merit.\nIn 2006, a championship trophy was commissioned from silversmith Thomas Lyte, to be followed by a second trophy commissioned for the Under 20 Six Nations championship. Designed and created by Thomas Lyte, the trophies are made from sterling silver and feature engraving detail with the logos of the competing countries.\nIn 2007, the Six Nations committee formally adopted Italy as the sixth national team member in the championship, replacing Spain.

There were 60 competitors from 54 nations. Nations had been limited to two swimmers each since the 1984 Games. The event was won by Alexander Popov of Russia, the third man to successfully defend an Olympic title in the 100 metre freestyle (after Duke Kahanamoku in 1912 and 1920 and Johnny Weissmuller in 1924 and 1928). Gary Hall, Jr. returned the United States to the podium in the event after a one-Games absence. Gustavo Borges, the silver medalist in 1992, earned bronze. Popov and Borges were the 9th and 10th men to earn multiple medals in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the 22nd appearance of the men's 100 metre freestyle. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1900 (when the shortest freestyle was the 200 metres), though the 1904 version was measured in yards rather than metres.\nFour of the eight finalists from the 1992 Games returned: gold medalist Alexander Popov of the Unified Team (now competing for Russia), silver medalist Gustavo Borges of Brazil, fourth-place finisher Jon Olsen of the United States, and seventh-place finisher Christian Tröger of Germany.\nIn 1992, Popov defeated defending gold medalist Matt Biondi and proceeded to win every major 50 metre and 100 metre freestyle championship since Barcelona, including the 1994 world championships. Popov was the odds-on favorite. His biggest challenger was American Gary Hall, Jr., runner-up in the world championships.\nBelarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan each made their debut in the event. The United States made its 21st appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the boycotted 1980 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThis freestyle swimming competition used the A/B final format instituted in 1984. The competition consisted of two rounds: heats and finals. The swimmers with the best 8 times in the semifinals advanced to the A final, competing for medals through 8th place.

There were 43 competitors from 36 nations, with each nation having up to two swimmers (a limit in place since 1984). The event was won by Danyon Loader of New Zealand, the nation's first medal in the men's 200 metre freestyle. Brazil also received its first medal in the event, with Gustavo Borges taking silver. Bronze went to Australia's Daniel Kowalski.\nBackground.\nThis was the 10th appearance of the 200 metre freestyle event. It was first contested in 1900. It would be contested a second time, though at 220 yards, in 1904. After that, the event did not return until 1968; since then, it has been on the programme at every Summer Games.\nThree of the 8 finalists from the 1992 Games returned: two-time silver medalist Anders Holmertz of Sweden, bronze medalist Antti Kasvio of Finland, and fifth-place finisher Vladimir Pyshnenko of the Unified Team (now competing for Russia). At the 1994 World Aquatics Championships, Kasvio (gold), Holmertz (silver), and Danyon Loader of New Zealand (bronze) had been on the podium. They were among about 10 swimmers considered to have a chance at the gold medal in a relatively open field.\nCroatia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Thailand, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan each made their debut in the event. Australia made its 10th appearance, the only nation to have competed in all prior editions of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a two-round (heats, final) format. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952. A swimmer's place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. There were 8 heats of up to 8 swimmers each. The top 8 swimmers advanced to the final. The 1984 event had also introduced a consolation or \"B\" final; the swimmers placing 9th through 16th in the heats competed in this \"B\" final for placing. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nThis swimming event used freestyle swimming, which means that the method of the stroke is not regulated (unlike backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly events). Nearly all swimmers use the front crawl or a variant of that stroke. Because an Olympic-size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of four lengths of the pool.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nNo new world or Olympic records were set during the competition.\nResults.\nHeats.\nRule: The eight fastest swimmers advance to final A, while the next eight to final B.\nSwimoff.\nPalmer and Sievinen, who had tied for 8th place in the heats to require the swimoff, tied again in the swimoff. This would have resulted in a second swimoff between the pair, but Sievinen elected to withdraw from the race, allowing the former to advance to the final A by default. Because Sievinen scratched out from the competition, the vacant spot in Final B was distributed to the next best-ranked swimmer, not yet qualified, in the heats.\nFinals.\nThere were two finals, one for the top 8 swimmers and one for the next 8 (9th through 16th)."

        "text": "Ronald Everett English (born May 21, 1968) is an American football coach and former player. He is the defensive coordinator and defensive backs coach for the Louisville Cardinals. English also served as the head football coach at Eastern Michigan University from 2009 to 2013, compiling a record of 11–46.\nPlaying career and education.\nFrom 1987 to 1990, English played college football at the University of California, Berkeley. He graduated in 1991 with a degree in communications. In 1995, he received his master's degree in education administration from Arizona State University.\nCoaching career.\nAssistant coach (1992–2008).\nEnglish has served as an assistant coach at Mt. San Antonio College, Northern Arizona University, San Diego State University, Arizona State University, the University of Michigan, and University of Louisville. He coached the defensive secondary at Michigan from 2003 through 2005. In February 2006, he accepted a position on the coaching staff of the NFL's Chicago Bears. However, Michigan head coach Lloyd Carr persuaded English to stay on as the defensive coordinator after Jim Herrmann, who coordinated Michigan's defense from 1997 to 2005, accepted a position with the NFL's New York Jets. In the 2006 season, English coached only safeties, rather than the entire defensive secondary, to allow him to concentrate more fully on his responsibilities as defensive coordinator. English's defense showed great success against most run-heavy teams in the Big Ten Conference and allowed the fewest rushing yards per game in the nation.\nWith Carr's retirement at the end of the 2007 season, English, along with all of the assistant coaches at Michigan except for running backs coach Fred Jackson, was fired by incoming head coach Rich Rodriguez. English interviewed for the head coaching vacancies at the University of Arkansas and at Michigan before accepting the defensive coordinator duties for Steve Kragthorpe at the University of Louisville.\nEastern Michigan (2009–2013).\nEnglish was hired as head coach at Eastern Michigan in December 2008. At the time of his hiring by Eastern Michigan, he was one of six African American head coaches at Football Bowl Subdivision teams; the others (and their teams at the time) were Turner Gill (Buffalo), Kevin Sumlin (Houston), Mike Locksley (New Mexico), Randy Shannon (University of Miami), and Mike Haywood (Miami University) .\nEastern Michigan compiled a 0–12 record in 2009. An article on \"ESPN.com\" ranked the Eagles the second-worst team in NCAA FBS football.\nThe Eagles posted a 2–10 record in 2010, English's second season as head coach, losing all four non-conference games and stretching their losing streak to 18 games before winning an overtime game at Ball State and another game at Buffalo in the latter part of the season.\n2011 saw the Eagles achieve their best season in 17 years. They finished the season 6–6, 4–4 in MAC play to finish in a tie for fourth place in the West Division. Despite being 6–6, the Eagles were not bowl eligible because two of their wins came against FCS teams. The 6 wins were the most wins the school had since 1995 when they also had 6 wins. Following the season, English was named the Mid American Conference Coach of the Year.\nFollowing the success of the 2011 season, media outlets speculated that English could be a candidate for head coaching openings at BCS schools. Based on his west coast recruiting background and Big Ten coaching experience, the schools most often mentioned were Illinois, Arizona State, and Washington State.\nEnglish returned to the Eagles as head coach for the 2012 season. Eastern Michigan posted a 2–10 record in 2012, with their wins coming against Army (48–38) and Western Michigan (29–23). EMU faced a difficult schedule, with 7 losses to teams that participated in a post season bowl game. Additionally, the Eagles lost to (FCS) #14 ranked Illinois State by a score of 31–14 in the second week of the season.\nEnglish was abruptly fired on November 8, 2013 — less than 24 hours before the Eagles' game against Western Michigan. Later that day, \"The Detroit News\" revealed that English had been fired after school officials obtained a tape of a tirade English delivered to his team during an October team meeting. The speech was laden with expletives (\"shitbird\" was especially plentiful), and included at least one homophobic slur. On November 9, athletic director Heather Lyke confirmed the existence of the tape and condemned it as \"wholly inappropriate\" and \"absolutely unacceptable.\" English subsequently apologized, admitting that he had \"lost my poise,\" but hoped to be able to coach again.\nCareer after Eastern Michigan (2014–present).\nIn 2014, English joined the Cleveland Browns' internship program under a Bill Walsh NFL Minority Coaching Fellowship. English also spent more time with his family and in church.\nEnglish returned to coaching on February 9, 2016, as defensive coordinator at San Jose State under Ron Caragher.\nOn February 2, 2017, English joined Dan Mullen's staff at Mississippi State as safeties coach."

Instead, England played a highly successful series of unofficial Tests against a Rest of the World XI which was captained by Gary Sobers and included some of the best South African players such as Graeme Pollock, Eddie Barlow, Mike Procter and Barry Richards. These matches were promoted as Tests at the time, but were not recognised as such by the International Cricket Conference.

        "text": "The 1976 English cricket season was the 77th in which the County Championship had been an official competition. Clive Lloyd adopted a new approach to Test cricket as a battery of pace bowlers was used to intimidate the England batsmen. Lloyd adopted the tactic after his own team's experiences against Jeff Thomson and Dennis Lillee the previous year. England's batsmen were no match for Andy Roberts and Michael Holding, but even more worrying was a dearth of effective England bowlers and it was West Indian batsmen like Viv Richards and Gordon Greenidge who were the real stars of a long, hot, dry summer. Middlesex won the County Championship.\nInternational series.\nWest Indies men.\nAfter two drawn games in the first two tests, the West Indians won the remaining three Test matches to convincingly win the series 3–0.\nThe West Indies cricket team made their tenth visit to England, under the captaincy of Clive Lloyd. The first Test match was played at Trent Bridge in Nottingham. Viv Richards scored 232 runs for the West Indies in the first innings, and shared a partnership of 303 with Alvin Kallicharran. The West Indies ultimately batted for most of the first two days, and closed their innings on 494. In response, England made 332, avoiding the follow-on; David Steele scored a century. Batting again, the West Indies scored 176 runs, and set England a total of 339 runs to win. England, with only five and a quarter hours left in the match, did not attempt the chase, nor were the West Indies able to take early wickets to give them a chance of winning. The match finished as a draw; writing in the \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", Norman Preston said that \"it was a disappointing performance\" from England.\nAustralia women.\nThe Australian women's cricket team toured England between May and August 1976. The test series against England women's cricket team was played for the Women's Ashes, which England were defending. The series was drawn 0–0, meaning that England retained the Ashes. England won the three-match ODI series 2–1. The second ODI, won by England, was the first women's cricket match ever played at Lord's."

An Australian team that was clearly affected by Packer proved to be no match for an England side that stayed together despite the controversy.

        "title": "Swimming at the 1996 Summer Olympics – Men's 200 metre backstroke",
        "text": "The men's 200 metre backstroke event at the 1996 Summer Olympics took place on 26 July at the Georgia Tech Campus Recreation Center in Atlanta, United States. There were 39 competitors from 33 nations. Each nation had been limited to two swimmers in the event since 1984. The event was won by Brad Bridgewater of the United States, with his countryman Tripp Schwenk taking silver. It was the first time since 1980 that one nation had two swimmers on the podium in the event (Hungary took gold and silver then). Bridgewater's victory was the United States' first in the event since 1984 and fourth overall. Italy earned its second consecutive bronze medal in the men's 200 metre backstroke, with Emanuele Merisi taking the honours this time.\nBackground.\nThis was the 10th appearance of the 200 metre backstroke event. It was first held in 1900. The event did not return until 1964; since then, it has been on the programme at every Summer Games. From 1904 to 1960, a men's 100 metre backstroke was held instead. In 1964, only the 200 metres was held. Beginning in 1968 and ever since, both the 100 and 200 metre versions have been held.\nFour of the 8 finalists from the 1992 Games returned: gold medalist Martín López-Zubero of Spain, silver medalist Vladimir Selkov of the Unified Team (now competing for Russia), fourth-place finisher Hajime Itoi of Japan, and fifth-place finisher Tripp Schwenk of the United States. Seventh-place finisher Tamás Deutsch of Hungary was entered but did not start. The medalists at the 1994 World Aquatics Championships had been Selkov, López-Zubero (also the 1991 World Champion), and Royce Sharp of the United States. Sharp did not compete in Atlanta; the American team consisted of Schwenk and Brad Bridgewater. López-Zubero's 1991 world record still stood. He had come out of retirement to try to defend his title, but Selkov was favoured in Atlanta. Emanuele Merisi of Italy had the best time of 1996 so far and was also a strong contender.\nBarbados, Chile, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, Slovakia, and Thailand each made their debut in the event. Australia and Great Britain each made their ninth appearance, tied for most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a two-round (heats and final) format. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952. A swimmer's place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. A \"consolation final\" had been added in 1984. There were 6 heats of up to 8 swimmers each. The top 8 swimmers advanced to the final. The next 8 (9th through 16th) competed in a consolation final. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nThis swimming event used backstroke. Because an Olympic-size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of four lengths of the pool.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nNo world or Olympic records were set during the competition, with the gold medal time 0.07 seconds slower than the Olympic record.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe eight fastest swimmers advanced to final A, while the next eight went to final B.\nFinals.\nThe finals were held on the same day as the heats, 26 July.\nFinal A.\nBridgewater took the lead at the first turn, with Schwenk behind him. Both tired late, but Merisi was not quite able to catch either."

        "text": "The World Aquatics Swimming World Cup (formerly known as the FINA Swimming World Cup) is an international series of swimming meets organized by World Aquatics (the international governing body formerly known as FINA). Launched in 1988, the World Aquatics Swimming World Cup is staged between August and November every year and attracts a high level of athletes due to the considerable prize money on offer. The event is traditionally held in short course (25m pool) format, with a switch to long course (50m pool) format in pre-Olympics years.\nPrior to the COVID hiatus in 2020 the event was being held in three clusters, totaling seven three day meets across seven different locations with prize money reaching US$2.5 million. The event resumed in 2021 as four meets each of three days duration, and the 2023 edition was staged as three meets each of three days duration.\nThe event is popular with prominent swimmers due to the prize money on offer. In 2022, a total of US$1.2 million was awarded. For each meet the top 20 male and female athletes shared US$224,000 prize money ($112,000 per gender). At the end of the meet series an additional US$262,000 per gender was awarded to the top eight men and women athletes based on their overall ranking using a point score incorporating placings and performance.\nThe 2023 event is notable for a number of reasons including a switch to long course (50m) format as a pre-Olympics year event, the event acting as a qualifying meet for both the forthcoming World Aquatics Championships in 2024 and Olympic Games in 2024, and the introduction of an “open” category in 50m and 100m events for transgender swimmers. However, there were no entries and the \"open\" category was shelved.\nEvents.\nTraditionally the events are the same for all meets but the competition order may vary, although this has varied from the 2021 resumption of the meet. All events are swum prelims/finals, with the exception of the 800m freestyle and 1500m freestyle which are swum as timed finals (fastest heat in the finals session). The meets are held over two or three days, with preliminary heats in the morning and finals in the evening. A noted exception to this style are the meets held in Brazil, where prelims have been in the evening with finals the following morning.\nOn most years, the races are held in short course pools; the exception recently being the season leading up to an Olympic year where events are swum in long course venues.\nCurrent 2023 series events (to be swum in 50m pools):\nAn 'open' category was created in 2023 after World Aquatics announced that trans women were banned from competing in the women's category if they had “experienced any part of male puberty beyond tanner stage two, or before [the] age [of] 12, whichever is later\". The category was shelved after receiving \"no entries.\"\nWinners.\nSource:\nOne stage in 1979\nMedals table (1988-2016).\nSource:"

        "title": "1947 English cricket season",
        "text": "1947 was the 48th season of County Championship cricket in England. It is chiefly remembered for the batting performances of Denis Compton and Bill Edrich who established seasonal records that, with the subsequent reduction in the number of first-class matches, will probably never be broken. Their form was key to their team Middlesex winning the County Championship for the first time since 1921, although they were involved in a tight contest for the title with the eventual runners-up Gloucestershire, for whom Tom Goddard was the most outstanding bowler of the season. Compton and Edrich were assisted by the fact that it was the driest and sunniest English summer for a generation, ensuring plenty of good batting wickets.\nThe South Africans, captained by Alan Melville, toured the British Isles for the first time since 1935 and played a Test series of five matches against England, who won the series 3–0 with two matches drawn, again largely thanks to the batting of Compton and Edrich. The South Africans enjoyed greater success in first-class matches against the English county teams, losing only one and winning eleven. Other notable fixtures played include the University Match, Gentlemen v Players (twice) and North v South (three matches). The Minor Counties Championship was won by Yorkshire II, one of six first-class teams who entered their second elevens in the competition. Unusually, there were two tied matches in 1947, compared with two in the previous 21 years. Essex v Northamptonshire and Hampshire v Lancashire were the 20th and 21st tied matches in the history of first-class cricket worldwide since the earliest known instance in 1783.\nThe main source for information about the season is \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", in its 85th edition published in April 1948. This announced the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 1947: Martin Donnelly, Alan Melville, Dudley Nourse, Jack Robertson and Norman Yardley. 1947 was the first season to be reviewed by \"Playfair Cricket Annual\", which began publication in April 1948.\nBackground.\nThe main sources for the 1947 season are the 85th edition of \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" and the inaugural edition of \"Playfair Cricket Annual\", both published in April 1948. The 1947 season was therefore the first to be reviewed by \"Playfair\".\nThe winter of 1946–47 in the United Kingdom was harsh with heavy snowfalls disrupting communication and supply for about six weeks from January to March. February was one of the coldest months on record and the winter culminated in the wettest March for 300 years. Yet it was followed by what \"Playfair\" called a \"glorious summer\" in which fine weather prevailed and, as \"Wisden\" says, \"the sun shone throughout\". This was in sharp contrast to the wet summer of 1946. Despite austerity and rationing, the country was still in post-war euphoria and there was great enthusiasm for sporting events. As \"Wisden\" reports, \"crowds thronged the grounds (and) Lord's was often full for county games\".\n\"Wisden\" editor Hubert Preston commented in his 1948 editorial that \"the season of 1947 bears favourable comparison with any year within living memory\". He had expected the continuous fine weather to produce pitch conditions favourable to batsmen and hence the predominance of drawn matches but, as he wrote, \"actually about three-quarters of the County Championship matches were won outright\".\n\"Playfair\" editor Peter West wrote that \"a grand and glorious summer\" had been \"a feast amidst austerity indeed, a fine reward for months of waiting through a chill and infamous winter\". West went on to claim that \"nearly three million people\", with the younger generation strongly represented, attended first-class cricket matches in 1947. It must be remembered that this means three million attendances and not literally three million people.\nSouth African tour.\nSouth Africa toured the British Isles in 1947 and played a five-match Test series against England, who won the series 3–0 with two matches drawn. This was the first South African tour of England since 1935, the team captained by Alan Melville who had played in England for Oxford University and Sussex. \"Wisden\" commented that despite their lack of success in the Test series, South Africa \"gave indication of real ability at all points of the game\" and \"little more experience is necessary to make them really powerful\" in international cricket. \"Playfair\" acclaimed the South Africans as a \"most popular team (who) enriched the game and set an excellent example\", the tour realising a profit of £10,000.\nSouth Africa fared very well in their matches against the county clubs, winning eleven of the eighteen matches and losing only one, which was the opening match of the tour against Worcestershire by 39 runs. They lost to Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in May by 158 runs, but in September they had a convincing nine wicket win against the South who included Denis Compton, Bill Edrich and Jack Robertson.\nThe outstanding South African players were the three best batsmen: Melville, Bruce Mitchell and Dudley Nourse. Ken Viljoen had a good tour and made six centuries but none in the Tests. The bowling was moderate as no one took more than 15 wickets in the series or averaged under forty. Athol Rowan with 102 was the only tourist to take a century of wickets in the season. The team badly lacked pace bowlers and included only two medium-fast seamers, Jack Plimsoll and Lindsay Tuckett, the majority of bowlers being spinners: Rowan, Tufty Mann, Ian Smith and Leslie Payn. South Africa had three wicketkeepers in the party: Johnny Lindsay, Douglas Ovenstone and George Fullerton. Ossie Dawson was an all-rounder and the remaining batsmen were Denis Begbie, Dennis Dyer and Tony Harris. South Africa used fourteen players in the Test series: the ones who missed out were Begbie, Ovenstone and Payn.\nTest series summary.\nEngland's key victory came in the second Test at Lord's where Compton (208) and Edrich (189) shared a partnership of 370 which was a then world record for the third wicket in Test cricket. Doug Wright took ten wickets in the match and England won by ten wickets. In the third Test at Old Trafford, Edrich scored 191 in another big partnership with Compton and took eight wickets in the match. England won the fourth Test at Headingley in only three days by ten wickets. This time it was Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook who claimed the batting honours while the best bowler was Harold Butler with match figures of seven for 66 on debut.\nEngland team in 1947.\nThe England team began 1947 on tour in Australia, where they were beaten 3–0 in the Test series, and then toured New Zealand where the sole Test arranged was ruined by rain. Having played South Africa at home in 1947, England's next tour was to the West Indies beginning in January 1948.\nEngland, playing under the auspices of MCC, took 17 players to Australia and New Zealand. Wally Hammond captained the side in his final Test series. The other batsmen were Len Hutton, Cyril Washbrook, Denis Compton, Bill Edrich, James Langridge, Laurie Fishlock and Joe Hardstaff junior. Jack Ikin and Norman Yardley were essentially all-rounders. Godfrey Evans and Paul Gibb were the wicketkeepers and the bowlers were Alec Bedser, Doug Wright, Dick Pollard, Peter Smith and Bill Voce. Gibb, Hardstaff, Hutton and Langridge did not play in New Zealand.\nWith Hammond having retired from international cricket, Yardley was appointed captain for the home series against South Africa. In the first Test, England recalled Eric Hollies and selected three debutants: Sam Cook, Tom Dollery and Jack Martin. Hutton, Washbrook, Edrich, Compton, Evans and Bedser were retained from the winter tour and these six with Yardley were the mainstays of the England team in 1947. There were changes again for the second Test with Charlie Barnett replacing Dollery, George Pope replacing Martin and Wright coming back in place of Cook. Bedser missed the third Test and was replaced by Cliff Gladwin while Ken Cranston was brought in to replace Pope. In the fourth Test, Jack Young was introduced in place of Hollies and Harold Butler for Gladwin. Edrich missed the last Test, as again did Bedser, and there were yet more changes elsewhere with Dick Howorth coming in to replace Barnett and Bill Copson replacing Butler. Jack Robertson took Edrich's place. It all meant that, in a five-match series they won 3–0, England used 21 different players.\nWith so many players under consideration, it was difficult to predict who would go to the West Indies in the winter and that question became even more complex when several players decided not to go. Bedser, Compton, Edrich, Hutton, Wright and Yardley from the 1947 series all declined the tour before the squad was selected, as did Trevor Bailey who was in contention for a place. With Yardley missing, MCC reappointed pre-war captain Gubby Allen to lead the party but he was the first in a spate of injuries when he damaged a leg muscle on the outward voyage. Following further injuries to Dennis Brookes and Joe Hardstaff junior, Allen asked MCC to send reinforcements and Hutton then changed his mind, flying out just in time to play against British Guiana.\nOf the players who went to the West Indies, the only ones who had played against South Africa in the summer were Hutton, Evans, Cranston, Robertson, Howorth and Butler. Hardstaff and Ikin had been to Australia and New Zealand the previous winter. The other eight were Allen and seven newcomers: Dennis Brookes, Billy Griffith, Jim Laker, Winston Place, Gerald Smithson, Maurice Tremlett and Johnny Wardle. \"Playfair\" was disappointed with the situation in the West Indies, especially as England were well beaten in the Test series. The team, it said, \"could not be called great by any standards\" as it was too \"experimental\" but it at least seemed \"workmanlike\" and in Laker a new star had been discovered. \"Playfair\" ominously concluded its review by reference to the 1948 Australian team being \"about to descend upon us well armed in all key departments (and) we shall have to do better than this\".\nCounty Championship.\nMiddlesex won the County Championship under the captaincy of Walter Robins, who stood down at the end of the season. He was well supported by slow left-arm spinner Jack Young, who took 159 wickets in all matches; off break bowler Jim Sims; pace bowler Laurie Gray; wicketkeeper Leslie Compton; and their quartet of high-scoring batsmen Denis Compton, Bill Edrich, Syd Brown and Jack Robertson. The \"Wisden\" editorial drew attention to an additional feat by Middlesex in defeating \"The Rest\" by nine wickets in the last match of the season at The Oval. Previously, only Yorkshire (1905 and 1935) had beaten The Rest, the fixture having lapsed from 1936 to 1946. Yorkshire had won the County Championship in 1946 but slipped to seventh place in 1947 and \"Wisden\" remarked on the retirement of \"several veterans\" after the 1946 season, although the highest innings score of the 1947 season, 270 not out, was achieved by Yorkshire's Len Hutton.\n\"Playfair\" described the championship as \"a great tussle\" between Middlesex and Gloucestershire that was not settled until 28 August when Middlesex won their penultimate match, defeating bottom team Northamptonshire at Lord's by 355 runs. The key match, however, took place earlier in the month when Middlesex defeated Gloucestershire at Cheltenham by 68 runs. Middlesex had finished runners-up five times in succession: 1936 to 1939 and again in 1946. Since Middlesex's previous title in 1921, no southern team had won the championship and so their 1947 triumph ended 25 seasons of northern domination.\nGloucestershire v Middlesex, August 1947.\nThe Gloucestershire v Middlesex match at the College Ground, Cheltenham was the ultimate decider of a close-fought championship. It began on Saturday, 16 August on the same day as the fifth Test at The Oval and \"Playfair\" remarked that \"even the final Test seemed a matter of secondary importance\". There was no play on Sundays in 1947 and the match continued into Monday, 18 August, when it was concluded with Tuesday to spare. Middlesex were without Compton and Robertson who were both playing for England but they did have Edrich, rested by England.\nMiddlesex won the toss and decided to bat, Brown and Edrich opening with a stand of 50 before Brown was out lbw to the seamer Colin Scott. Edrich went on to score 50 but, apart from some resistance by tailenders Sims and Young, Middlesex's batting collapsed as Gloucestershire's great off spinner Tom Goddard took seven for 70. Middlesex were all out for 180 but Sims (six for 65) and Young (four for 55) turned the tables and bowled out Gloucestershire for 153. At close of play on Saturday, Middlesex had reached 9 for 1 in their second innings, Goddard having taken the key wicket of Edrich, so Monday's play began with Middlesex ahead by 36 and nine wickets standing. The decisive phase of the match was a third wicket partnership on Monday morning between Harry Sharp and the captain Robins. Scoring 46 and 45 respectively, they shared a stand of 70 runs which \"Playfair\" described as \"vital\". Otherwise, Middlesex again collapsed and Goddard took eight for 86 to complete an outstanding match analysis of fifteen for 156. So Gloucestershire with a day and a half remaining needed 169 to win. Jack Crapp tried to hold the innings together and scored 40 but Gloucestershire were rolled over for only 100 to lose by 68 runs. Young took five for 27 but an important role was again played by Sharp, this time as an off spinner, taking the wickets of three of Gloucestershire's top six batsmen, two of them without scoring. \"Playfair\" points out that Sharp at the time was still only a member of the Lord's ground staff but he played the key part in winning the match that ultimately settled the championship.\nSeason finale.\nGloucestershire had gone into the Cheltenham match with a lead of four points in the championship table and the immediate outcome was that Middlesex overtook them to lead by eight points, both teams having four matches still to be played. Middlesex had to play Derbyshire away, \"always difficult to beat\", and three home matches against Surrey, Northamptonshire and third-placed Lancashire whom \"Playfair\" termed \"the toughest nut to crack\". \"Playfair\" considered Gloucestershire's programme to be easier as they faced four moderate teams: Glamorgan at Cheltenham, Hampshire and Sussex away, and Essex at Bristol.\nThere was no change after the first two matches as Gloucestershire beat Glamorgan in two days and Middlesex won the difficult encounter at Derby. It all went wrong for Gloucestershire at Dean Park, Bournemouth where stubborn Hampshire batting forced a draw while Middlesex were defeating Surrey with some ease. This gave Middlesex a twenty-point lead and only two matches each to be played. Middlesex's victory over the bottom team Northants settled it, especially as Gloucestershire surprisingly lost to Sussex by nine wickets. Even so, there was a slight sting in the tail as Middlesex then lost their final match to a determined Lancashire by 64 runs while Gloucestershire rallied to defeat Essex. The final table showed Middlesex winning by twenty points, on the face of it a handsome margin, but in reality it was a much closer contest than the figures would suggest.\nFinal table.\nThe seventeen first-class county teams played a total of 26 matches each. Twelve points were awarded for a win and six to each team if the result was a tie, as happened twice in 1947. Teams leading on first innings who subsequently drew or lost the match were awarded four points. Essex were awarded two points in one match they lost after a tie on first innings.\nThe final championship table was as follows:\nTied matches.\nTied matches are a rarity in cricket and there had been only two County Championship ties in the previous 21 years. Essex and Somerset had tied in 1926, then Worcestershire and Somerset in 1939. In 1947, there were two tied matches: Essex v Northamptonshire and Hampshire v Lancashire. \"Playfair\" noted that these were the 20th and 21st tied matches in the history of first-class cricket worldwide since the earliest known instance in 1783.\nThe Essex v Northamptonshire match was played at Valentines Park, Ilford 17 to 20 May. Northamptonshire won the toss and decided to bat, scoring 215 all out with a top score of 49 by Vince Broderick while Essex's Test leg break and googly bowler Peter Smith took four for 65. By close of play on Saturday, Essex had replied to 170 for 4 with opener Chick Cray on 90 not out. He completed his century, exactly 100, on Monday morning and Essex went on to total 267 all out. Northamptonshire were 219 for 5 at the close on Monday evening with their veteran batsman John Timms on 90 not out. Timms was out for 112 on Tuesday morning and Peter Smith completed ten in the match by taking six for 84 in the Northamptonshire total of 291. Essex therefore needed 240 to win with ample time left on the final day. They had a good stand of 103 for the fourth wicket between Frank Vigar (60) and Len Clark (64) but spinners Broderick and Bertie Clarke kept picking up the wickets and Essex were still ten behind when the ninth went down. The last pair were captain Tom Pearce and wicketkeeper Tom Wade who managed to level the scores before Wade was bowled by Clarke to tie the match.\nHampshire v Lancashire was played at Dean Park, Bournemouth on 27 to 29 August. Hampshire batted first and scored 363, the innings continuing into the Thursday morning, Jim Bailey with 95 the top scorer. Lancashire captain Ken Cranston had taken four for 73 and he led the Lancashire reply with 155 not out before declaring the innings closed at 367 for 9. Hampshire safely negotiated the last few overs on Thursday evening to close on 18 for 0 before totalling 224 for 7 declared on Friday, Jim Bailey again the top scorer with 63. This was a sporting declaration by the Hampshire captain Desmond Eagar as there was time to bowl only 47 overs before the close. Cyril Washbrook led the chase with 105 while Jim Bailey, having twice starred with the bat, took six for 82. When the last over began, Lancashire had reached 220 for 8 with Jack Ikin and wicketkeeper Alfred Barlow batting, but this was the last wicket as William Roberts had been taken to hospital with a broken finger and could not bat. Ikin and Barlow came together at 204 for 8 and so had added 16 for the final wicket to level the scores. Barlow was on strike and facing off spinner Gerry Hill. The first three balls produced no run and then Barlow was run out as he tried for a quick single to end the match in a tie.\nMiddlesex.\nAs \"Playfair\" put it, \"few will dispute that the best side won the championship\". Middlesex's first four batsmen — Robertson, Brown, Edrich and Compton — scored between them 12,193 runs in all first-class matches, a level of success unprecedented in county cricket. The other batting positions were contested by George Mann, who was heir-apparent to Robins as club captain and succeeded him in 1948; Alan Fairbairn, a 1947 debutant who scored centuries in each of his first two county matches; Harry Sharp and Alec Thompson. The three main bowlers were Gray, Young and the veteran Sims. Ian Bedford, aged seventeen, made his debut and took twelve wickets in his first two matches. Middlesex also made effective use as bowlers of Robins, Edrich and Denis Compton. \"Playfair\" noted the consistently high standard of the Middlesex fielding, especially by Brown, while Leslie Compton as wicket-keeper was a great success. Middlesex made exclusive use of Lord's Cricket Ground in St John's Wood, north London, for their thirteen home matches.\nGloucestershire.\nGloucestershire's strong challenge for the title was despite the loss of Wally Hammond but in Tom Goddard they had the best bowler in the country. He took 238 wickets in all matches, 61 more than his nearest rival. He was well supported by Sam Cook who took 120 championship wickets and gained a Test call, but the team lacked quality pace bowlers with George Lambert largely on his own apart from the medium pace of Test batsman Charlie Barnett. Five Gloucestershire batsmen scored over 1,000 runs in the championship: captain Basil Allen, Barnett, Jack Crapp, George Emmett and wicket-keeper Andy Wilson. \"Playfair\" recorded concerns about the pitch at Bristol which was alleged by some to have been prepared especially for Goddard. It is true that Gloucestershire won eight of the nine matches played there but equally true that Goddard took most of his wickets in matches not at Bristol. Ken Graveney made his debut for Gloucestershire in 1947 and his brother Tom was waiting in the wings. Other players included Monty Cranfield, Bev Lyon, Clifford Monks, William Neale, Grahame Parker, Colin Scott and Alfred Wilcox.\nGloucestershire generally used their headquarters in Bristol, playing nine of their fourteen home matches there. All the venues were:\nLancashire.\nLancashire finished third for the second season in succession. They lost only once (to Somerset) but drew ten and tied one. They were well served by their openers Cyril Washbrook and Winston Place who both scored more than 2,000 runs in all first-class matches, Washbrook playing in all five Tests and Place being selected for the West Indies tour. There were problems in the middle order where only Geoff Edrich performed consistently well, but the two Test all-rounders, Jack Ikin and captain Ken Cranston scored over 1,000 runs. Lancashire's outstanding bowler was paceman Dick Pollard who finished the season strongly after an indifferent early phase and took 144 wickets in all matches. Slow left armer William Roberts bowled steadily and took 74 championship wickets but \"Playfair\" remarked that he was short of Test class. As with the batting, the all-rounders Cranston and Ikin shored up the bowling with 56 and 48 championship wickets respectively. Looking to the future, Lancashire made a \"find\" in wicketkeeper Alfred Barlow and there were good reports of Alan Wharton who became a Lancashire stalwart for many seasons. Batsman Barry Howard played some good innings in his debut season and, along with Cranston, was awarded his county cap. Other players included future county captain Nigel Howard, Tom Brierley, Phil King in his final season, future Test umpire Eddie Phillipson, Eric Price, and Gordon Garlick who joined Northamptonshire in 1948.\nLancashire played the majority of their home matches at their Old Trafford headquarters and played two matches elsewhere in the county:\nKent.\nKent improved from seventh to fourth and were able to announce increased attendances and membership. The team was again captained by Bryan Valentine and featured England stars Godfrey Evans and Doug Wright, though they missed several championship matches for Test calls. Kent were particularly well served by their batsmen, although Valentine had problems with loss of form at times. Les Ames, Les Todd and Arthur Fagg all scored more than 2,000 runs in the season. The young left-hander Peter Hearn was regarded as a fine prospect and was awarded his county cap. Wright was the main bowler and was supported by off spinner Ray Dovey, all-rounder Jack Davies and the two pacemen Fred Ridgway and Norman Harding. Harding died unexpectedly in September, aged 31. Other players included Geoffrey Anson, Brian Edrich, the veteran Hopper Levett in his final season, Tony Mallett, future captain Bill Murray-Wood and Tony Pawson. A curious case was pace bowler Jack Martin, who played for Kent only twice in 1947 and yet was selected to play for England in the Trent Bridge Test.\nKent's policy was to play home matches throughout the county and they used seven venues:\nDerbyshire.\nDerbyshire was the most improved team of the year, rising ten places from fifteenth in 1946 to fifth in 1947. They were a strong bowling side with pacemen Bill Copson, Cliff Gladwin and George Pope all playing for England. Dusty Rhodes, bowling mainly leg break, and left-armer Eric Marsh provided support. Derbyshire, captained for the first time by Edward Gothard, played attacking cricket and were involved in several close finishes. The batting was weakened by injuries to Stan Worthington, in his final season, and Denis Smith. Charlie Elliott and Arnold Townsend topped 1,000 runs but \"Playfair\" noted that the presence of one really top-class batsman would have made an enormous difference to Derbyshire's batting. John Eggar, who topped the county averages, might have filled that gap but his teaching career enabled him to play only in August. Smith was seconded to keep wicket for most of the season until George Dawkes, formerly of Leicestershire, was able to join the team. Dawkes went on to become one of the greatest English wicketkeepers. Another notable debutant was fast bowler Les Jackson. Other players included Albert Alderman, 55-year-old Harry Elliott in his final season, Alan Revill and Pat Vaulkhard.\nMost of Derbyshire's home matches were played at one of their two main venues in Derby and Chesterfield but they occasionally played elsewhere. The five venues used were:\nSurrey.\nSurrey showed improvements on 1946 but \"Playfair\" remarked on \"the need for new blood\". Having said that, the arrival of Jim Laker certainly resolved any problems in spin bowling and his future partner Tony Lock was already making progress at second eleven level. Another good start was made by opening batsman David Fletcher who was awarded his county cap with Laker and Eric Bedser. Six Surrey batsmen topped 1,000 runs in the championship: Eric Bedser, Fletcher, captain Errol Holmes, Tom Barling, John Parker and Stan Squires. Laurie Fishlock had a chequered season having been dogged by serious illness since he went to Australia with England in the winter. Wicketkeeper Arthur McIntyre played well and produced some good batting performances. The main bowlers were Alec Bedser, Jim Laker and the retiring Alf Gover, who took 121 wickets in his final season. Seamer Eddie Watts could make only a few appearances due to injury. Geoffrey Whittaker made eight appearances and two future Surrey mainstays Bernie Constable and Stuart Surridge also played.\nSurrey played twelve of their thirteen home matches at The Oval and one in Guildford. Two first-class matches not involving the Surrey XI were played in Kingston-upon-Thames. All venues:\nWorcestershire.\nFollowing the emigration of Sandy Singleton to Rhodesia after the 1946 season, Allan White succeeded him as Worcestershire captain. The team lacked batting strength and did well to improve their championship position. The outstanding player was Test all-rounder Dick Howorth who was, as in 1946, the first player to complete the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets. Howorth was a slow left arm spinner and formed a successful partnership with Peter Jackson who bowled mostly off breaks. Howorth took 164 wickets in all matches and Jackson 125. Future England player Roly Jenkins made a telling contribution (67 wickets) with his leg breaks and googlies while paceman Reg Perks took 123 wickets in all matches. The success of the bowlers owed much to keeper Hugo Yarnold who claimed the most victims in the championship. Howorth, Jenkins, Eddie Cooper and, in his first full season, Don Kenyon all exceeded 1,000 runs. Worcestershire's best known batsmen at the time were Charles Palmer and the veteran Bob Wyatt and they were the first two in the county averages but neither played a full season. Laddie Outschoorn qualified for the championship for the first time and showed promise. Other players included Ronald Bird, Fred Cooper (brother of Eddie), Norman Whiting and Martin Young.\nWorcestershire played nine of their thirteen home matches at their County Ground headquarters in Worcester and used five venues in all:\nYorkshire.\nYorkshire fell from champions to seventh and used 25 different players in the championship alone. There was future promise in five new caps: wicketkeeper Don Brennan, batsmen Willie Watson and Gerald Smithson, fast bowler Alec Coxon and left arm spinner Johnny Wardle. In addition, future stalwart Ted Lester began his career with three successive centuries and topped the county averages. Future captain Vic Wilson made a few appearances. Brian Sellers captained the team for the final time before handing over to Norman Yardley for the 1948 season. Bill Bowes in his final season topped the bowling averages and received a record benefit. He was supported by Wardle, off spinner Ellis Robinson, seamer Frank Smailes and new pace bowlers Coxon and Ron Aspinall. Yorkshire were hit by the loss through illness, after only four matches, of slow left armer Arthur Booth, who had been their outstanding player in 1946. The batting was generally not up to scratch and relied far too much on one man, the great Len Hutton who, because of Test calls, played in only half of Yorkshire's championship matches. Other players included Harry Crick, Harry Halliday, Freddie Jakeman, Geoffrey Keighley and pace bowler John Whitehead.\nYorkshire used seven venues in various parts of the county:\nGlamorgan.\nGlamorgan never had a settled team and there were a number of new arrivals at the end of the season including Gilbert Parkhouse, Jim Eaglestone, Norman Hever and Phil Clift. This might suggest a club in transition but there were grounds for optimism which were realised in 1948 when the club won its first championship. Glamorgan's bowling in 1947 suffered an early blow when their only real pace bowler Peter Judge was ruled out for the season after being injured in only the second match. Dynamic captain Wilf Wooller had to carry the seam attack almost single-handedly and took 85 wickets in addition to scoring 1,270 runs. Glamorgan relied mostly on spin with Len Muncer and the veteran Johnnie Clay bowling off breaks and opening batsman Emrys Davies helping out with his slow left. Davies created a county record by scoring five centuries in the season and formed an effective opening partnership with Arnold Dyson, both of them scoring more than 1,500 runs in the championship. Future Test player Allan Watkins exceeded 1,000 runs and there were some good innings by Wat Jones and George Lavis. The main wicketkeeper was Haydn Davies who claimed 47 victims in the championship but had some problems with a damaged hand. Other players included veteran Austin Matthews in his final season, Jim Pleass, Arthur Porter and Maurice Robinson.\nMost of Glamorgan' home matches were played at one of their two main venues in Cardiff and Swansea but they occasionally played elsewhere. The four venues used were:\nSussex.\n\"Playfair\" emphasised the contrast between strong batting and weak bowling at Sussex who recovered from bottom place in 1946 to finish a creditable equal ninth. Only Jim Cornford performed consistently well among the bowlers while six batsmen scored over 1,000 runs. Three of these exceeded 2,000 in all matches: John Langridge, George Cox and Harry Parks. James Langridge reached the thousand despite missing several matches due to appendicitis. Charles Oakes and new captain Hugh Bartlett were the other two. His predecessor turned club secretary Billy Griffith had a poor season with the bat but kept wicket well enough to be selected for England's winter tour. Other players who appeared were Paul Carey, Donald Smith, Jim Wood, Jack Oakes, John Nye and two future Test players Alan Oakman and David Sheppard.\nSussex generally played home matches at their County Ground headquarters in Hove and used five venues in all:\nEssex.\nEssex matches were noted for high scores as Essex themselves scored more runs than anyone except Middlesex but also conceded the most. Their two outstanding players were the cousins Peter and Ray Smith who both completed the double. These two, bowling leg break and off break respectively, effectively carried the Essex attack. Outstanding prospect Trevor Bailey was the sole pace bowler of any effect but he was only available in the latter half of the season and then injuries limited his bowling, though he topped the county's batting averages. The other all-rounder Frank Vigar took 59 championship wickets bowling leg breaks but was expensive. Bailey, Vigar and the Smiths were half of the eight Essex players who scored 1,000 runs in the season, the other four being captain Tom Pearce, Chick Cray, Dickie Dodds and Doug Insole. Wicketkeeper Tom Wade had a very good season with 77 victims, 38 of them stumped. Essex were also represented by Bill Dines, Bill Morris, Denys Wilcox, Dick Horsfall, Frank Rist, Harry Crabtree, Len Clark and Sonny Avery.\nEssex continued their policy of playing matches throughout the county and home venues used in 1947 were:\nNottinghamshire.\nNottinghamshire, captained for the first time by William Sime, drew half of their matches and only the top three had less defeats. They lost Bill Voce early in the season to retirement and this placed a heavy burden on the remaining pace bowlers Arthur Jepson and Harold Butler. They did well, both taking over 100 wickets and Butler being picked for England, but they lacked support. The only other bowler to make any kind of impression was slow left armer Harry Winrow who took 56 championship wickets. Winrow was one of five batsmen to score 1,000 runs. The best of these by a distance was England's Joe Hardstaff junior who had an outstanding season, scoring 2,396 with seven centuries. Walter Keeton, Reg Simpson and Tom Reddick all topped 1,000 runs while Charles Harris was approaching the landmark when his season was ended early by illness. Wicketkeeper Eric Meads claimed 52 victims in championship matches. Cambridge University captain Guy Willatt batted well when available and young Peter Harvey, leg break and googly bowler, looked a good prospect, but Freddie Stocks did not fulfil the promise he showed in 1946. Nottinghamshire made exclusive use of their headquarters at Trent Bridge in Nottingham for their thirteen home matches.\nSomerset.\nSomerset were captained for the only time by educator Jack Meyer but the team did not learn anything and dropped seven places from fourth in 1946 to equal eleventh. Even so, they pulled off some surprises by defeating champions Middlesex twice and inflicting on third-placed Lancashire their only loss of the season. Somerset were let down by their batting with only Harold Gimblett reliable through the season. Michael Walford played very well in the closing weeks when he became available and \"Playfair\" called him \"the best amateur batsman in England on a firm wicket\". The main bowler was veteran Arthur Wellard who was supported by all-rounders Bertie Buse and Johnny Lawrence, slow left armer Horace Hazell, captain Meyer and new pace bowler Maurice Tremlett. The veteran Wally Luckes kept wicket and claimed 55 championship victims. Other players were Bill Andrews in his final season, Frank Lee in his final season before becoming an umpire, Hugh Watts, George Woodhouse, Mandy Mitchell-Innes and Miles Coope.\nSomerset generally played home matches at their County Ground headquarters in Taunton and used five venues in all:\nLeicestershire.\nLeicestershire had fourteen defeats and finished fourteenth. In Les Berry, they had the only professional captain in the County Championship. In July, they were involved in two exciting finishes, first when Middlesex were set to score 66 in 25 minutes and got them, courtesy of Edrich and Compton, to win by ten wickets with only four minutes to spare. Second, in their home match against Derbyshire, Leicestershire themselves succeeded in a run chase scoring 391 to win by three wickets at over eighty runs an hour, the winning run coming from a straight six off the third ball of the final over. Leicestershire were a strong batting side with Berry, Vic Jackson, Gerry Lester, Francis Prentice, Maurice Tompkin and George Watson all exceeding 1,000 runs while all-rounder Anthony Riddington scored over 800. Wicketkeeper Percy Corrall claimed 59 victims in championship matches. The main bowler was Jack Walsh, a great exponent of slow left-arm wrist-spin, who took 152 wickets in all matches. Jackson and the veteran James Sperry bowled well but Leicestershire's main need was a good pace bowler. Other players were Thomas Chapman, Jack Howard and Harry Pickering.\nLeicestershire played the majority of their home matches at their Grace Road headquarters in Leicester and used four venues in all:\nWarwickshire.\nWarwickshire, let down by unreliable batting, were captained by attacking batsman Peter Cranmer. Despite their lack of success, they attracted large crowds to Edgbaston. Their best players were Test spinner Eric Hollies and batsman Tom Dollery, who was to become captain as a professional in 1948, though Dollery had a relatively poor season in 1947. Warwickshire were well served by their bowlers. In addition to Hollies, these were three new caps in the two seamers Victor Cannings and Charles Grove; and the New Zealand pace bowler Tom Pritchard. Dollery had to play as wicketkeeper in several matches when Cyril Goodway was unavailable. \"Playfair\" commented on advantages gained by the bowlers being \"squandered\" by inconsistent and unreliable batsmen. Five batsmen did exceed 1,000 runs but none had a good average: Cranmer, Dollery, Aubrey Hill, Jimmy Ord and Ken Taylor. Other players were Bill Fantham, John Hossell and Ron Maudsley. Warwickshire played eleven home matches at their Edgbaston headquarters in Birmingham and two matches at the Courtaulds Ground in Coventry.\nHampshire.\nHampshire, a very ordinary side who bowled badly, were captained by Desmond Eagar. The batting was occasionally good and top of the county's averages was wicketkeeper Neil McCorkell who scored 1,539 championship runs and claimed 49 victims. Neville Rogers and Johnny Arnold played some good innings to both comfortably exceed 1,000 runs. Eagar and Gerry Hill both reached 1,000 with low averages and the all-rounder Jim Bailey, who took 53 wickets, fell just short of 1,000 runs. \"Playfair\" considered \"the steady and loyal George Heath\" to be the best of the bowlers who included Bailey, Hill, Victor Ransom, Lofty Herman and the injury-plagued Charles Knott. Other players included Gilbert Dawson, Thomas Dean, Arthur Holt, Alan Shirreff and future stalwart Leo Harrison.\nHampshire's home matches were shared between three venues:\nNorthamptonshire.\nNorthamptonshire slipped from sixteenth to bottom and were captained by Arthur Childs-Clarke. Dennis Brookes was the pick of the batsmen and earned a trip to the West Indies in the winter. Bill Barron, Percy Davis and John Timms also topped 1,000 runs but with low averages. Vince Broderick put in a sound all-round effort with 860 runs and 87 wickets while the best bowler was West Indian Test player Bertie Clarke with 89 wickets. The attack was hampered by injuries to Nobby Clark who did not play often. Wicketkeeper Kenneth Fiddling claimed 40 victims. Other players included Leo Bennett, Robert Clarke, Arthur Cox, Eddie Davis, William Nevell and Jack Webster.\nNorthamptonshire played nine of their thirteen home matches at their County Ground headquarters in Northampton and used five venues in all:\nOther major fixtures.\nMCC v Yorkshire.\nAt the beginning of the season, on 3, 5 and 6 May, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) played a three-day match at Lord's against the 1946 county champions, Yorkshire. MCC won by 163 runs. The MCC team in batting order was Dennis Brookes (Northamptonshire), Jack Robertson (Middlesex), Bob Wyatt (Worcestershire), Denis Compton (Middlesex), Bryan Valentine (Kent, captain), Leslie Compton (Middlesex, wicketkeeper), Wilf Wooller (Glamorgan), Haydn Davies (Glamorgan), Jack Young (Middlesex), Rowland Shaddick (Middlesex) and Jack Martin (Kent). MCC won the toss and chose to bat first but were bowled out in 57 overs for 134, Denis Compton making 73. Yorkshire got off to a very bad start when Len Hutton was dismissed by Jack Martin for nought. This began an outstanding spell for Martin who finished with six for 23 from 12.1 overs as Yorkshire collapsed to 81 all out. At close of play on the Saturday, MCC were 67 for one with Jack Robertson 36 not out. On the Monday, Robertson built a big innings and scored 164 of a declared total of 343 for 9. Yorkshire's hopes slumped when Hutton was again dismissed cheaply and at close of play they were 69 for two. Vic Wilson tried his best and scored 74, which was his highest career score to date, but Jack Young was in fine form and took six for 85 to win the match for MCC.\nUniversity Match.\nThe 1947 University Match between Oxford University and Cambridge University was played at Lord's over three days from 5 to 8 July and was drawn. Oxford batted first and amassed 457 with Kent's Tony Pawson scoring a chanceless 135 before being run out. Geoffrey Keighley made 99 and Test batsman Martin Donnelly 81. Cambridge could manage only 201 in reply as Oxford's other Test player Abdul Hafeez Kardar took four for 50. Following on, Cambridge rallied to 314 for four and ensured the draw, Guy Willatt scoring 90 and Trevor Bailey 60 not out.\nDonnelly (New Zealand) and Kardar (India) both played Test cricket before winning their \"Blues\" and no university team had ever before included two Test players in the same year. Cambridge had a notable future Test player in Trevor Bailey (England). Donnelly was the first university batsman ever to score 1,000 runs before the University Match in two successive seasons. \"Playfair\" praised Donnelly as \"the finest left-hand batsman in the world\", ahead of even the Australians Arthur Morris and Neil Harvey.\nGentlemen v Players.\nThere were two Gentlemen v Players matches in 1947. The first was played at Lord's over three days from 16 to 18 July and was drawn after rain restricted play on the last two days. The second was played at the North Marine Road ground in Scarborough from 10 to 12 September and the Players won by an innings and 10 runs.\nMartin Donnelly dominated the Lord's match with \"a truly magnificent innings\", scoring 162 not out as the Gentlemen made 302 in the first innings, Bill Edrich scoring 79. The Players replied with 334 for eight declared, Cyril Washbrook scoring 101 and David Fletcher 77. The Gentlemen slumped to 25 for five as wickets fell to Cliff Gladwin and Harold Butler but were rescued by Norman Yardley and Ken Cranston, rain ensuring that the result was a draw. The Gentlemen were led by England captain Norman Yardley and selected three Oxford University players — Donnelly, Tony Pawson and Tony Mallett — and two from Cambridge University: Guy Willatt and Trevor Bailey. The team included current England players Edrich and Cranston while Billy Griffith kept wicket. Reg Simpson made his first appearance in the fixture but could only score 4 and 0. The Players were captained by Les Ames who played as a batsman, Godfrey Evans keeping wicket. Washbrook opened with Jack Robertson, the other batsmen being Denis Compton, Charlie Barnett and Fletcher. The pace bowlers were Butler and Gladwin, supported by spinners Jack Walsh and Doug Wright.\nAt Scarborough two months later, a much weaker Gentlemen team were easily beaten by an innings after totalling 135 and 217 against 362. Denys Wilcox opened the innings and did well with scores of 25 and 57 while skipper Yardley made 35 and 23, but Edrich and Donnelly did not contribute many against a strong Players attack, particularly Dick Howorth who took four wickets in each innings. The Players had three England pace bowlers: Butler, Alec Bedser and Dick Pollard. Howorth top-scored for the Players too, with 80, and captain Len Hutton scored 64.\nNorth v South.\nThere were three North v South matches in 1947, involving largely makeshift teams, and \"Playfair\" did not bother to report on them. The first was at the St George's Road Cricket Ground, Harrogate over three days from 27 to 29 August and the North won by 86 runs. The second was played at the Leyland Motors Ground in Kingston-upon-Thames from 3 to 5 September and the South won by 4 wickets. The final match was played at North Marine Road Ground, Scarborough from 6 to 9 September and was drawn.\nMiddlesex v The Rest.\nHaving won the County Championship, Middlesex played a representative team called The Rest (i.e., the Rest of England) at The Oval in a four-day match lasting from 13 to 17 September. Middlesex won by 9 wickets. The Rest was a very strong team entirely consisting of players who had played or would play for England at Test level. In batting order, they were Cyril Washbrook, Winston Place, Dick Howorth, George Emmett, Norman Yardley (captain), Ken Cranston, Godfrey Evans (wicketkeeper), Alec Bedser, Doug Wright, Tom Goddard and Harold Butler. Middlesex won the toss and decided to bat first but were soon reduced to 8 for two as Bedser dismissed both openers Syd Brown and Jack Robertson. Bill Edrich and George Mann took the score on to 53 for three when Mann, who had scored 33, was stumped by Evans off Wright. This brought Edrich and Denis Compton together. In keeping with their form throughout the season, they amassed 426 runs between them and enabled skipper Walter Robins to declare at 543 for nine. Edrich made 180 which was just enough for him to surpass Tom Hayward's old record season aggregate, which Compton had already beaten. Compton retired hurt when he had scored 55 and the total was 191 for three. He returned with his knee strapped when the score was 274 for four and, despite his injury, he went on to make 246, his highest score of the season. Robins made 33 while Compton was off the field but the tailenders did not score many. The Rest were bowled out for 246 and followed on. They made 317 in their second innings, leaving Middlesex to win the match with 21 for one.\nMinor Counties Championship.\nSix first-class clubs entered their \"second elevens\" into the Minor Counties Championship in 1947 and \"Playfair\" reported that five more would do so in 1948. Teams played each other irregularly and a league table was compiled on the basis of average points per match played. A win was worth ten points with lesser awards given in certain specific circumstances. All teams played at least eight matches, the most being fourteen by Yorkshire II. The leading teams in the table were Surrey II, Yorkshire II, Lancashire II, Staffordshire, Suffolk and Oxfordshire who each exceeded five points per match.\nTo decide the championship, a challenge match took place at The Oval on 4 to 6 September and Yorkshire II defeated Surrey II by 111 runs. Future first-class players taking part included Tony Lock, Vic Wilson, Stuart Surridge, Ron Aspinall and Bernie Constable.\nCompton and Edrich.\n\"Playfair\" described 1947 as \"the Edrich and Compton year\" and remarked that their domination of first-class cricket through the season was unprecedented. Between them, they scored 7,355 runs, took 140 wickets and held 66 catches. It is improbable that the records achieved by Compton of most runs and most centuries in a season will ever be broken, especially since the reduction in first-class matches which began in 1969. What will be remembered is not the statistics but the style because Compton and Edrich scored quickly and played attacking cricket.\n\"Playfair\" described Compton as \"a genius\" who was brilliant at improvisation; Edrich on the other hand was \"not a genius but a wonderfully efficient batsman\". Both men were hampered by injuries. Compton had a bad knee caused by a piece of chipped bone which was removed after the season ended. Edrich suffered a pulled shoulder muscle in early August which impeded his batting and prevented him from bowling again. When the season began in May, Edrich scored a century in his first innings and followed up with two more, including a score of 225, before the end of the month. Compton did not score his first century until his eleventh innings. Edrich scored 1,047 runs in the calendar month of July and Compton 1,039 runs in August. Edrich's highest score was 267 not out for Middlesex against Northamptonshire and Compton's was 246 for Middlesex against The Rest.\n\"Wisden\" published an appreciation of Compton and Edrich written by R. C. Robertson-Glasgow who began by opining that \"they go together in English cricket as Gilbert and Sullivan go together in English opera\". Robertson-Glasgow made further comparisons, strictly cricket ones this time, with Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe for England and with Don Bradman and Bill Ponsford for Australia. However, he tempered his praise by pointing out that Compton and Edrich had yet to \"quell the fiercest Test attack\" as, although they had dominated the South African bowling in 1947, Australia remained another matter with \"fulfilment awaited\". While \"Playfair\" spoke of \"brilliance and efficiency\", Robertson-Glasgow eulogised about \"genius and talent\" and then \"poetry and prose\" in comparing Compton with Edrich. He concluded by describing them as \"fitting adornments and exponents\" of cricket, itself a \"refreshment from worldly struggle\".\n\"Wisden\" Cricketers of the Year.\nIn its 1948 edition, \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" announced that its five cricketers of the 1947 season were Martin Donnelly, Alan Melville, Dudley Nourse, Jack Robertson and Norman Yardley. As a rule, though it has occasionally been broken, \"Wisden\" never selects a player more than once. Among players of 1947 who had been selected previously were Les Ames in 1929; Walter Robins in 1930; Bill Bowes in 1932; Bruce Mitchell in 1936; Tom Goddard, Joe Hardstaff junior and Len Hutton in 1938; Denis Compton in 1939; Bill Edrich and Doug Wright in 1940; Peter Smith and Cyril Washbrook in 1947.\nMartin Donnelly was rated by \"Wisden\" as \"the world's best present-day left-handed batsman\". Although small in stature, Donnelly was noted for powerful stroke play using the drive, pull and cut shots. Donnelly dominated university cricket in 1947 but his outstanding performance was \"an almost faultless 162 not out in three hours\" for the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's. Donnelly was a New Zealand Test batsman who had starred for the Dominions team in 1945.\nAlan Melville's career was dogged by injury and family illness. \"Wisden\" reflected this by opening its citation with \"a story of courage and determination\". In 1947, Melville won admiration for his \"feeling for the spirit of the game\" which was a significant factor in ensuring the success of \"a most delightful Test series\". Melville enjoyed personal success as a batsman in 1947, especially by scoring centuries at both Trent Bridge and Lord's. Melville was a strong onside batsman, noted for his fine timing. He retired from first-class cricket after the 1947 tour.\nDudley Nourse, son of Dave Nourse, had his best Test series as a batsman in 1947 with 621 runs and two centuries. He was an aggressive batsman, noted for his powerful hitting off the back foot. He played the cut and hook shots especially well. Nourse was an expert fielder, rated by \"Wisden\" as one of the best in world cricket. As vice-captain in 1947, he was Melville's expected successor.\nJack Robertson \"surpassed all reasonable anticipations\" in 1947 when his aggregate of 2,760 runs was exceeded only by his colleagues Compton and Edrich. Robertson was noted for \"elegant strokeplay\" and was strong on the back foot, especially his skill in playing the ball off his legs. \"Wisden\" saw \"a striking resemblance\" between Robertson and his Middlesex predecessor J. W. Hearne who was another polished performer adept at shot placement.\nNorman Yardley was selected for his successful captaincy of England in 1947 after he succeeded Wally Hammond. \"Wisden\" said his appointment as England captain \"set a crown upon a cricket career that (always) promised distinction\". Yardley was primarily a batsman, noted for \"watching the ball carefully and hitting it hard\", but \"Wisden\" also praised his fielding in all positions and the consistency of length and direction in his bowling.\nAchievements.\nTeams.\nThree teams scored more than 600 runs in an innings:\nThe lowest innings total of the season was 25 by Somerset against Gloucestershire at Bristol.\nBatting.\nOf batsmen who played at least ten innings, twelve averaged 50.00 or more.\nIn total, 91 batsmen scored 1,000 runs in the season. Of these, seventeen scored 2,000-plus.\nCompton's 3,816 runs and his 18 centuries are records for an English first-class cricket season. Edrich's 3,539 runs is the second highest aggregate of all time in a single season. Compton's two records were previously held by Tom Hayward, who scored 3,518 runs (including 13 centuries) in 1906, and Jack Hobbs, who completed 16 centuries (among 3,024 runs) in 1925.\nBetween them, the Middlesex trio of Compton, Edrich and Robertson scored 42 centuries in the season but none of them scored two in the same match. This feat was achieved eight times:\nA total of 26 double-centuries were scored, Bill Edrich and Joe Hardstaff making the most with three each. The highest individual innings was 270 not out by Len Hutton for Yorkshire against Hampshire at Bournemouth.\nBowling.\nOf bowlers who took fifty or more wickets, twelve achieved an average less than 20.\n22 players took 100 wickets or more in the season and six of these took over 150 wickets.\nThere were twelve hat-tricks in the season and six instances of three wickets taken in four balls. Tom Goddard did the hat-trick twice, against Glamorgan at Swansea and Somerset at Bristol, and Doug Wright once, against Sussex at Hastings, which meant that they equalled the world career hat-trick record of six, set by Charlie Parker.\nTom Goddard had the best bowling analysis of the season when he took nine for 41 against Nottinghamshire at Bristol. His colleague Sam Cook was second-best with nine for 42 against Yorkshire, also at Bristol. Three other bowlers — Peter Smith, Len Muncer and Cliff Gladwin — took nine in an innings and there were twelve instances of eight in an innings, including three by Goddard. Goddard took fifteen wickets in a match three times but the best match analysis was sixteen for 215 by Peter Smith for Essex against Middlesex at Colchester. Arthur Wellard and Doug Wright took fifteen wickets in a match once apiece.\nAll-round.\nThree players completed the season \"double\" of 1,000 runs scored and 100 wickets taken:\nFielding and wicketkeeping.\nFive fielders held more than forty catches in the season:\nFour wicketkeepers held more than fifty catches:\nThree wicketkeepers completed more than thirty stumpings:\nMost wicketkeeping victims overall:\nFootnote.\n• a) The Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 1947 were announced in the 1948 edition of \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\"."

        "title": "1948 English cricket season",
        "text": "1948 was the 49th season of County Championship cricket in England. Don Bradman, who was shortly to retire, made his final appearance in England. Bradman's Australian team, which included Arthur Morris, a very young Neil Harvey, Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller, went through the tour without being beaten and became known to cricket's folklore as \"The Invincibles\". They won the Test series 4–0. Glamorgan won the County Championship for the first time under the dynamic captaincy of Wilf Wooller.\nThe season was preceded by the first publication of \"Playfair Cricket Annual\" which has become a mainstay among cricket publications. Playfair is a pocket guide (though in its early years it had a larger page size) providing a mass of potted information about the sport, and is seen by many fans as an essential accessory to watching cricket in England.\nTest series.\nAustralia's \"Invincibles\" defeated England 4–0 with the Third Test drawn. England's batting was strong on paper, the first four in the order generally being Len Hutton, Cyril Washbrook, Bill Edrich and Denis Compton. But they found the fast bowling trio of Lindwall, Miller and Johnston a handful, especially since the playing conditions that summer allowed a new ball to be taken after only 55 overs. England's bowling was largely reliant on Alec Bedser, and against such a strong Australian batting line-up even his average was unimpressive.\nThe first innings of the First Test set the pattern, with England only reaching as many as 165 thanks to 63 from Jim Laker at number 9. Johnston finished with 5/36. In reply, Bradman and Hassett both made centuries, and England had a deficit of 344. Assisted by an injury that prevented Lindwall from bowling, England made 441 in their second innings, thanks mainly to 184 by Compton, but Australia still won by 8 wickets.\nAustralia won at Lord's by 409 runs, with Morris making a century in the first innings and Sid Barnes one in the second, and none of the English side even reaching fifty in either innings. Lindwall took 5/70 in the first innings and Ernie Toshack had 5/40 in the second.\nThe Third Test was drawn, and England might have won had not the Manchester weather caused much time to be lost. In England's first innings Compton had to retire hurt early on after being hit on the head by Lindwall, and needed two stitches, but he returned to the crease at 119 for 5 and finished with 145 not out out of 363.\nAt Headingley, one of the most famous of all Tests was played. It was a high-scoring affair, with Washbrook and Edrich making hundreds in England's first innings, and Harvey - on his debut in Anglo-Australian Tests - making one for Australia. Early on the final day, with the pitch by now helping spin, England declared their second innings, setting Australia to make 404 in 344 minutes. Laker, not yet the force that he would be a few years later, bowled poorly, and there were many fielding lapses. Thus, against all expectation, Australia got the runs with 12 minutes and 7 wickets to spare, with Morris making 182 and Bradman 173 not out.\nThe final Test of the series was the biggest disaster of all for England. They lost by an innings and 149 runs. Batting first, England were shot out for 52, of which Hutton made 30. Lindwall took 6/20. The Australian openers put on 117, and the total eventually reached 389 (Morris 196). In their second effort England managed only 188. (Johnston 4/40). It was known that this would be Bradman's final Test, and the crowd gave him an ovation when he walked out to bat. He only needed four runs to average 100 in Test cricket, but Eric Hollies bowled him second ball for a duck.\nMorris finished the series with 696 runs at 87.00, and Lindwall and Johnston each took 27 wickets. For England, the player emerging with most credit was Compton, with 562 runs at 62.44."

        "text": "Still Climbing is the second and final studio album released by American R&amp;B trio Brownstone. It was released by MJJ Music and the Work Group on June 23, 1997 in the United States. The album contains the second line-up of the group after the departure of original member Monica Doby. She was replaced by Kina Cosper, whose first and only appearance was on this album before departing for a solo career in 2000. \"Still Climbing\" features the singles \"5 Miles to Empty\" and \"Kiss and Tell\" as well as \"In the Game of Love\" which originally appeared on the soundtrack to the 1996 film \"The First Wives Club\".\nCritical reception.\nIn his review for Allmusic, senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that \"Still Climbing\" \"suffers from the same inconsistent songwriting that plagued their debut \"From the Bottom Up\", yet that isn't a fatal flaw. There are as many strong singles on \"Still Climbing\" as on the debut, and Brownstone sounds stronger and more confident on the record, making it an enjoyable, if tentative, step forward.\"\nTrack listing.\nNotes\nSamples"

        "text": "Trinidad and Tobago sent a delegation to compete at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, United States from 8–24 February 2002. This was Trinidad and Tobago's third appearance at a Winter Olympic Games. The delegation consisted of three bobsledders, Gregory Sun, Andrew McNeilly, and Errol Aguilera. In the two-man competition, a four-run event in which all three men competed, they came in 37th place.\nBackground.\nThe Trinidad and Tobago Olympic Committee was recognized by the International Olympic Committee on 31 December 1946. Although they have sent delegations to every Summer Olympic Games since, except the 1960 Summer Olympics, they did not participate in their first Winter Olympics until the 1994 Lillehammer Games, and have never won a Winter Olympics medal. Salt Lake City was thus the nation's third appearance at a Winter Olympics. The 2002 Winter Olympics were held from 8–24 February 2002; a total of 2,399 athletes took part representing 77 National Olympic Committees. The Trinidad and Tobago delegation to Salt Lake City consisted of three bobsledders, Gregory Sun, Andrew McNeilly, and Errol Aguilera. Sun was chosen as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony.\nBobsleigh.\nGregory Sun was 39 at the time of the Salt Lake City Olympics, and had represented the country in their two prior Winter Olympics appearance. Andrew McNeilly was 29 years old, and Errol Aguilera was 23 years old; both were making their Olympic debuts. The two-man bobsleigh race was a four-leg race held on 16–17 February, with the sum of the times of all four legs determining final placement. Sun participated in all four runs, while McNeilly took part in the first two runs, and Aguilera was in the sled for the last two runs. On the first day, they posted run times of 49.74 seconds and 50.07 seconds. Overnight, they were in 37th and last place. The next day, they completed the third run in 50.68 seconds, and the final run in 49.69 seconds. Their final time was 3 minutes and 20.18 seconds, which put them in 37th place for the competition, last among all competitors. The gold medal was won by Germany in 3 minutes and 10.11 seconds, and the silver and bronze were taken by sleds from Switzerland."

        "text": "1905 was the 16th season of County Championship cricket in England. England defeated Australia 2–0 in the Test series and Yorkshire pipped defending champions Lancashire for the championship title.\nCounty Championship.\nYorkshire and Lancashire fought throughout the season; Lancashire were the first team to beat Yorkshire, in their ninth game, when hundreds from Reggie Spooner and Johnny Tyldesley helped Lancashire to an innings victory at Old Trafford. Lancashire went unbeaten until July, their fifteenth game, when Surrey overcame them at Aigburth, but Yorkshire were behind on the table with three losses before their match with Yorkshire at Bramall Lane. With Walter Brearley taking seven for 35 in the first innings, Lancashire took a lead of 101, but Wilfred Rhodes turned it around with 74 and four for 49. Lancashire could still have managed to take the title with wins in their final games, but a loss to Gloucestershire at Bristol while Yorkshire avoided defeat meant the title went to Yorkshire.\nThis season saw Northamptonshire join the Championship; they played twelve matches, beating Derbyshire and Hampshire to avoid the wooden spoon.\nFinal table.\nThe final County Championship table is shown below. One point was awarded for a win, none for a draw, and minus one for a loss. Positions were decided on percentage of points over completed games.\nAshes tour.\nAustralia toured England in 1905, playing 35 first class matches around the British Isles. They only lost three of them, beating both champions Yorkshire and runners-up Lancashire, but two of the lost matches were Tests, and they drew the other three to lose the series 0–2. England's captain, Stanley Jackson, not only won the series, but also won the toss in all five matches and headed both the batting and the bowling averages. Australia only took a first-innings lead in one of the matches, the first, and then Archie MacLaren responded with his highest career Test score of 140 before Bernard Bosanquet took eight for 107 and bowled England to a 213-run victory. The second Test only reached the third innings, with no play possible on the final day, while Australia survived 91 overs for the loss of seven wickets in the drawn third Test. In the fourth Test, however, they lost nine wickets for 51 on the final day, after being asked to follow on 249 behind. They lost by an innings and 80 runs, thus conceding an unassailable lead in the series before the final Test, where England made 430 and 261 for six declared to draw the game. The Australians' only other loss came at Leyton to Essex in June."

        "title": "Mike Peluso (ice hockey, born 1965)",
        "text": "Michael David Peluso (born November 8, 1965), is an American former professional ice hockey player. Peluso was known primarily as an enforcer throughout his National Hockey League (NHL) career. Peluso played in the NHL from 1990 until 1998. \nPlaying career.\nMike Peluso, known as a slick defenseman when drafted in 1985 by the New Jersey Devils, played for the University of Alaska Anchorage until 1989 rather than signing a professional contract with the NHL club. He signed as a free agent for the Chicago Blackhawks in 1989, and started his National Hockey League career in 1990.\nUpon joining the Hawks, he was switched to forward and encouraged to fight in order to stay in the lineup. He fought Basil McRae of the Minnesota North Stars in his first NHL game and recorded 728 penalty minutes in his first two years in Chicago. With 408 of these coming in 63 games during the 1991–92 NHL season, Peluso became one of only three players in NHL history, and the most recent, to have accumulated 400 PIM or more in a single season.\nHe spent parts of three years in Chicago before going to the new Ottawa Senators as the 21st pick in the 1992 NHL Expansion Draft. During his only season in Ottawa, he set the club record for most penalty minutes in a single season (318), but was allowed to play a more offensive role, scoring 15 goals along with 10 assists. Nevertheless, on June 26, 1993, he was traded to the New Jersey Devils to complete an earlier transaction that sent Craig Billington, Troy Mallette and Cosmo Dupaul, New Jersey's fourth round choice in 1993 Entry Draft, to Ottawa.\nAs in Ottawa, Peluso's gritty, hard-nosed and intimidating style made him something of a cult hero in New Jersey. He was an integral part of the infamous \"Crash Line\" with Randy McKay and Bobby Holík, a fourth-line combination whose energy and timely goal-scoring helped the Devils win their first of three Stanley Cups in 1995.\nPeluso then played for the St. Louis Blues and Calgary Flames. His career came to an end after suffering a spinal cord injury in 1997. He retired after the 1997–1998 season.\nInjury and lawsuit.\nOn December 18, 1993, while playing for the New Jersey Devils in a game against the Quebec Nordiques, Peluso was injured in a fight against Tony Twist. He was diagnosed with a concussion and sat out the next two games before returning to action five days later. Despite his continuing to play Peluso suffered a seizure and Dr. Marvin Ruderman allegedly wrote in January 1994 that Peluso: \"...should not sustain any further trauma to his head or he will suffer additional seizures and long-lasting brain damage...\" Because his role with the team was as an enforcer Peluso was expected to both sustain and dole out punishment, or as his lawsuit states: \"...he was on the ice to fight.\"\nPeluso remained on the roster and continued to play for the Devils for much of the next three years, including winning the 1995 Stanley Cup, but recalls overhearing then-trainer Teddy Schuch wonder as to Peluso's health only to be overruled by team doctor Barry Fisher. Peluso was later traded to the St. Louis Blues during the 1996–97 NHL season before finishing his professional career with the Calgary Flames the following year.\nIn 2012, after years of suffering from seizures, dementia, memory loss, anxiety and depression, Peluso filed for workers' compensation in California, naming the last four teams he had played for in his NHL career (he suited up for the Ottawa Senators prior to sustaining the concussion) as defendants. In the filing Peluso alleged that he spent tens of thousands of dollars on medical procedures and medication to alleviate his ailments. After several years of litigation Peluso was offered a $325,000 settlement but rejected the offer in August 2017.\nSeveral months passed with no resolution in the matter and in January 2019 Peluso sued the New Jersey Devils, former general manager Lou Lamoriello and doctors Marvin Ruderman, Len Jaffe and Barry Fisher. The suit alleges that Peluso's medical issues resulted from the injury he sustained in 1993, that team owners knew about the damage and hid the severity of the injury from him and the two teams that signed him subsequently."

The match was played at Stadium Australia in Sydney on 22 November 2003, and was contested by (the tournament hosts) and . The 20-team competition consisted of a group stage, from which eight squads qualified for the knockout stage. En route to the final, Australia finished first in Pool A with four wins and no losses or draws before defeating in the quarter-final and in the semi-final. England finished on top of Pool C and, like Australia, went undefeated with four victories and no draws before beating in the quarter-final and in the semi-final.\nThe final was played in front of a Rugby World Cup record crowd of 82,957, with 22 to 30 million television viewers, and was refereed by André Watson of South Africa. Australia scored first when Lote Tuqiri scored a try in the sixth minute, but Elton Flatley failed to score the resulting conversion. England's first points were through a penalty goal scored by Jonny Wilkinson at 11 minutes; Wilkinson scored a second penalty nine minutes later to put his side ahead of Australia. A third Wilkinson penalty goal after 28 minutes and a 38th-minute try by Jason Robinson (which Wilkinson was unable to convert) gave England a 14–5 lead at half-time. The second half saw Flatley score three penalty goals in succession; regular time ended with both teams tied 14–14, and the match went into extra time. Wilkinson scored a fourth penalty goal to put England back ahead of Australia in the second minute of extra time before Flatley equalised again with his fourth penalty goal with two minutes of extra time to play. With 28 seconds remaining, Wilkinson scored a drop goal with his right foot to secure a 20–17 victory for England.\nEngland's win was their first Rugby World Cup title. They were the first Northern Hemisphere team to win the tournament, ending 16 years of dominance by Southern Hemisphere teams. They are currently the only Northern Hemisphere team to have won a Rugby World Cup title. Wilkinson was named man of the match, and the England playing and senior coaching team were appointed to the Order of the British Empire in the 2004 New Year Honours. England failed to defend their trophy at the following 2007 Rugby World Cup (hosted by France), losing 15–6 to in the final. Australia reached the tournament's quarter-final stage, where they were defeated by England.\nBackground.\nThe 2003 Rugby World Cup, the fifth edition of the Rugby World Cup (the International Rugby Board's (IRB) leading quadrennial rugby union tournament for national teams), was held in Australia from 10 October to 22 November 2003. In the finals, 20 teams played a total of 48 matches. The eight quarter-finalists in the 1999 Rugby World Cup automatically qualified for the tournament; the remaining twelve spots were decided in qualifying rounds played between 23 September 2000 and 27 April 2003 by teams from a record 81 nations.\nTeams were divided into four groups of five in the finals, with each team playing each other once in a round-robin format. The two top teams from each group advanced to a knockout stage. Rights to host the final were awarded to Stadium Australia, a purpose-built venue for the 2000 Summer Olympics and the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney Olympic Park (an urban renewal project in the mid-west suburb of Homebush Bay). The stadium played host to six other matches in the World Cup.\n had won the World Cup on two previous occasions, in 1991 and 1999. Although had never won the tournament before, they reached the 1991 final (losing to Australia, 12–6). The 2003 final was the 29th match between Australia and England. Since Australia and England first played each other in 1909, England won 16 of those meetings (including the previous four), Australia won 11 and drew once, in November 1997. The teams had played each other in three of the past four World Cups, and the 2003 final was their fourth meeting in the competition's history. The most recent match between them before the 2003 World Cup was played at Docklands Stadium in Melbourne on 21 June 2003, a 29–14 victory for England. England had won 21 of their previous 22 test matches, and Australia had lost four matches before the competition began. At the start of the tournament, England were ranked first in the inaugural IRB World Rugby Rankings; Australia were ranked fourth.\nRoute to the final.\nAustralia.\nAustralia qualified for the tournament as defending champions, and were drawn in Pool A with , , and . Their first match, against Argentina on 10 October at Stadium Australia, was the tournament's opening game. Australia led 11–0 after two Elton Flatley penalties and Wendell Sailor's try at 20 minutes which Flatley failed to convert. Felipe Contepomi scored Argentina's only penalty seven minutes later, before a third Flatley penalty put Australia ahead 13–3 at half-time. Flatley scored his final penalty to extend Australia's lead before Ignacio Corleto scored a 72nd-minute try. A Joe Roff try converted by Flatley two minutes later, however, gave Australia a 24–8 win. Australia's second pool match was against Romania at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane on 18 October. They won 90–8, scoring three tries by Mat Rogers, two tries each by Matt Burke, Stephen Larkham and one try each by Flatley, Stirling Mortlock, Roff, Matt Giteau, Lote Tuqiri and George Smith; Flatley adding 11 conversions and a penalty.

Australia won by a World Cup-record margin of 142–0, with a tournament-record 22 tries: five by Chris Latham, three each by Giteau and Tuqiri, two each by Rogers and Morgan Turinui and one each by David Lyons, Mortlock, Jeremy Paul, Nathan Grey, Matt Burke, John Roe. Rogers had one penalty try and 16 conversions. Australia concluded their pool matches against Ireland on 1 November at Melbourne's Docklands Stadium. George Gregan gave Australia the lead with a drop goal, followed with a try by Smith. Ronan O'Gara's penalty put Ireland five points behind before a Flatley penalty restored Australia's eight-point lead. A second penalty goal by O'Gara gave Australia an 11–6 lead at half-time. Four minutes into the second half, Flatley scored a second penalty before a Brian O'Driscoll try (converted by O'Gara) put Ireland one point behind. Australia went four points ahead after Flatley's third penalty and, despite an O'Driscoll drop goal, advanced to the quarter-finals 17–16 as pool winners.\nTheir quarter-final was against at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium on 8 November. The sides were tied 9–9 at half-time, after three penalties by Flatley and two penalties and a drop goal by Chris Paterson. Tries by Mortlock, Gregan and Lyons were converted by Flatley, who scored his fourth penalty in the second half to put Australia 24 points ahead of Scotland. A last-minute Robbie Russell try (converted by Paterson) gave Scotland seven extra points, but Australia won the match 33–16 for a place in the semi-final. They returned to Sydney's Stadium Australia to play in their semi-final on 15 November. Australia opened the scoring at nine minutes, when Mortlock scored a try which Flatley converted. Flatley scored two penalties to increase Australia's lead before a try by New Zealand's Reuben Thorne, converted by Leon MacDonald, cut Australia's lead to 13–7 at half-time. Flatley scored three more penalties in the second half and, although MacDonald scored a late penalty for New Zealand, Australia held on to win the match 22–10 and a berth in the final.\nEngland.\nEngland qualified for the finals by reaching the quarter-finals of the 1999 World Cup, and were placed in Pool C with , , and . Their finals campaign began on 12 October at Subiaco Oval in Perth against Georgia. The team secured a 84–6 victory with one try each by Mike Tindall, Matt Dawson, Steve Thompson, Neil Back, Lawrence Dallaglio, Mark Regan, Dan Luger and Jason Robinson, two tries by Will Greenwood and Ben Cohen, and conversions by Jonny Wilkinson and Paul Grayson; Wilkinson added two penalties. Georgia's six points were penalties by Malkhaz Urjukashvili and Paliko Jimsheladze. Six days later, England played South Africa at Subiaco Oval. The teams were tied 6–6 at half-time, with two Louis Koen penalties for South Africa and two penalties by England's Wilkinson. Two more penalties by Wilkinson followed, before he converted a Greenwood try and scored two drop goals to put England at the top of their pool with a 25–6 win.\nTheir third group game was against Samoa at Docklands Stadium in Melbourne on 26 October. Samoa went ten points ahead with a penalty and a converted try by Earl Va'a before England levelled with a Neil Back try (converted by Wilkinson), after which Wilkinson scored a penalty. Two more penalties by Va'a and a second penalty by Wilkinson gave Samoa a 16–13 lead at half-time. England earned a penalty try after Samoa conceded a scrum, and Wilkinson converted it to return England to the lead. Va'a's two subsequent penalties put Samoa back in the lead, but England won 35–22 with tries by Wilkinson, Iain Balshaw and Vickery; Wilkinson converted a second try. England's final group match was against Uruguay at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium on 2 November. They had a team World Cup record victory of 111–13, with a national-record-equalling 17 tries scored by Lewis Moody, Josh Lewsey, Balshaw, Andy Gomarsall, Luger, Grayson, Stuart Abbott and Robinson (converted by Grayson or Mike Catt) to qualify for the quarter-finals as pool winners. Uruguay's points came from two first-half Juan Menchaca penalties and a second-half Pablo Lemoine try converted by Menchaca.\nIn the quarter-finals, England faced at Suncorp Stadium on 9 November. England scored the game's first points with a Wilkinson penalty, but Wales led 10–3 at half-time after tries by Stephen Jones and Colin Charvis (which Jones failed to convert). England moved 15 points ahead of Wales with a Greenwood try (converted by Wilkinson), followed by five successive penalties by Wilkinson. Martyn Williams scored a try (converted by Iestyn Harris) to put Wales eight points behind before a last-minute Wilkinson drop goal advanced England to the semi-finals, 28–17. England then faced in the semi-finals in wet, cold conditions at Stadium Australia on 16 November. Wilkinson gave England the lead with a ninth-minute penalty before an England line-out error allowed Serge Betsen to score a try, converted by Frédéric Michalak to give France a 7–3 advantage. England retook the lead when Wilkinson scored two drop goals and two penalties to give them a 12–7 lead at half-time. In the second half, Wilkinson scored a second drop goal and three more penalties to put England through to the final with a 24–7 victory.\nMatch.\nBefore the match.\nAndré Watson, a 45-year-old retired civil engineer and school rugby fly-half from South Africa, was selected as referee for the final. Watson had refereed two 2003 World Cup matches: the New Zealand–Wales and Argentina–Ireland matches in the group stage. He also refereed the 1999 Rugby World Cup Final and a number of Currie Cup and Super 12 finals. Watson was assisted by Paddy O'Brien and Paul Honiss of New Zealand, the two touch judges. Joël Jutge and Alain Rolland of France and Ireland were named the fourth and fifth officials, respectively, and South Africa's Jonathan Kaplan was the television match official. Tickets for the final sold out on 22 August 2003. The IRB returned an additional 2,000 tickets for the match to the Australian Rugby Union which it sold to the public since 13 November. Several Australian and British bookmakers cited England as the favourite to win the match.\nAustralia coach Eddie Jones noted that World Cup finals were generally disorganised, and said that it would be good if the match was contested \"with a good balance between the important ingredients of rugby, and that is contest versus continuity\": \"Our responsibility is to play naturally and with freedom and our natural game is to attack, so we'll be keeping our part of the bargain. If we can get England to, and the referee to contribute, we should have a great spectacle. It could be the world's great game of rugby.\" England coach Clive Woodward was pleased with Australia for their organisation of the tournament and the quality of their players and said about his team's chances for the final, \"My only goal when I left my business to take his job six years ago was to make England the best team in the world and win this thing. Now we have a real chance of doing exactly that.\" Woodward added, \"When the tournament began, I would have said this was my dream final. We have one objective and we're now one game away from achieving it. We certainly haven't come out here to finish second.\"\nA closing ceremony was held before the match. It began with the release of 18 of 20 inflatable cylindrical figures (representing the 20 qualifying teams), placed in a circle outside the pitch. Kate Ceberano performed Cyndi Lauper's \"True Colors\", the competition's official song, replacing Kasey Chambers, who had withdrawn. Three young children from the Sydney Children's Choir sang the rugby anthem, \"World in Union\", as part of the Rugby World Choir. The Australian national anthem, \"Advance Australia Fair\", was performed by Alice Girle and performing-arts student Akos Miszlai before the English national anthem \"God Save the Queen\" was played by Rugby World Choir members Belinda Evans and James Laing.\nThe match was broadcast live on television by the Seven Network in Australia, Sportsnet in Canada, and on ITV1 and S4C in the United Kingdom. The Theatre Broadcasting System of the Department of Defence carried coverage of the final for Australian troops stationed in Baghdad. Radio coverage was by ABC Radio on the non-commercial programme \"ABC Radio Grandstand\" and the commercial Macquarie Network in Australia and by BBC Radio 5 Live in the United Kingdom. Live sites were set up across Australia and London, with large screens to enable the public to watch the final. Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer cautioned Australian citizens watching the final abroad to be mindful of their safety after the Istanbul bombings in Turkey. The New South Wales Police adjusted its security measures to stop pitch invasions by spectators during the final. The British government was represented at the match by Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell.\nBoth teams' coaches released their line-ups on 19 November. Australia were without prop Ben Darwin, who sustained a prolapsed disc in his neck (contacting his spinal cord) during a scrum in the team's semi-final with New Zealand. Coach Eddie Jones replaced Darwin with Al Baxter at the tight head prop position. Jones also made Matt Dunning a prop reserve, and utility back Giteau replaced Grey as a substitute after Giteau's recovery from an ankle injury in Australia's quarter-final with Scotland. England coach Clive Woodward made one change to the side which began their semi-final against France; Tindall replaced Catt (who was made a substitute) to counter Mortlock's running ability, and indicating that England wanted to run more with the ball, and not rely on Catt and Wilkinson's dual kicking strategy. The final was the last time that captain Martin Johnson and Back represented England; both players retired the following year.\nFirst half.\nLow cloud cover and sporadic downpours fell in Sydney on the morning of the match; it tapered off to a drizzle, making the pitch damp. The match began before a World Cup record crowd of 82,957 at 20:00 local time with Wilkinson kicking the ball into Australia's right-hand defence, where it was collected by Nathan Sharpe. At two minutes, Rogers threw to Tuqiri; it threatened to overlap, but went into touch. A touch judge noticed that Woodman's right fist went outside at the back of a maul, and he was reprimanded by Watson. A penalty on England's line was awarded to Australia, but the team decided that it was too far for their players and Rogers should kick into touch. Australia earned a free kick when England had too many players in a line-out, but opted for a scrum. Gregan passed the ball to Larkham, whose high shot was directed from right to left. The taller Tuqiri out-jumped Robinson, and gathered the ball to score a try in the corner after a short run. Flatley's attempt to convert the try from the right-hand touchline struck the inside of the left-hand post, preserving Australia's 5–0 lead. Robinson passed some Australian players; Lyons committed an infraction in a tackle, earning England a penalty kick. Wilkinson made it 5–3 after 11 minutes, scoring the penalty from . Australia got a penalty kick two minutes later when Back held the ball too long in a line-out. England gained possession with breaks by Lewsey, but both teams had difficulty handing the ball and were cautioned by Watson.\nAt 20 minutes, England got a penalty kick when Cohen was tackled by Larkham without the ball. Larkham sustained a lip injury for which he received medical attention, and Giteau was brought in as a blood replacement. Wilkinson scored the penalty from outside the Australia half to put England ahead, 6–5. At 23 minutes, Wilkinson's long drop-goal attempt with his left foot went wide. Two minutes later, Ben Kay gathered the ball after Richard Hill kicked it through Australia's defence when Giteau dropped it after a Wilkinson tackle; Kay failed to score a try when he was tackled. Wilkinson sustained a minor shoulder injury when he tackled Giteau. In the 28th minute, England got another penalty kick after they won a scrum after a Flatley tackle and moved up the pitch. Wilkinson scored a third penalty goal from a narrow angle to extend England's lead to four points. Woodman was penalised two minutes later for incorrectly binding during a scrum, earning Australia a penalty. Flatley failed to score the penalty goal from the left of England's line. Larkham returned to the pitch after 31 minutes, following medical treatment of his lip. Dallaglio passed Australia's mid-pitch defence seven minutes later and passed the ball to Wilkinson, who briefly ran with it before making a long pass to the approaching Robinson on his left. Robinson passed Sailor, scoring a left-corner try. Wilkinson failed to convert the try almost from the touchline, and the first half ended with England leading 14–5.\nSecond half.\nFlatley began the second half of the match by kicking deep into the England half, and England started making errors in a scrum or a line-out. Seven minutes later, England made two errors in succession from consecutive line-outs and Australia earned a penalty kick when Dallaglio was penalised for being offside when he thought it was open play; Watson, however, decided that a ruck was being formed. Flatley successfully scored the penalty from inside Australia's half to put Australia three points behind. Soon afterwards, Australia made a change when David Giffin came on in place of Sharpe. In the 53rd minute, Dawson and Lewsey made an illegal cross that caused an accidental obstruction and gave Australia a penalty kick inside the England line. Flatley kicked for goal from where he could score a try, but failed to score the penalty. After 56 minutes, Australia substituted Larkham for Giteau. The team made a double substitution one minute later, bringing on Paul for Brendan Cannon and Matt Cockbain for Lyons. At 58 minutes, Australia earned a penalty after Vickery incorrectly bound in a scrum; Rogers failed to score the goal. The rain began to increase in intensity, and both sides made more playing errors.\nIn the 61st minute, Vickery was informed that he had illegally handled the ball on the floor in a ruck, giving Australia a penalty kick. Flatley took the penalty in front of the posts from the line, scoring to put Australia three points behind England. Watson then called England for three consecutive infractions during scrums. A shot by Tindall spun to the right at 68 minutes, and Greenwood gathered the ball. Greenwood was prevented from scoring a try by a left-footed leg tackle from Rogers, which brought the ball into touch just before the try line. After 71 minutes, Australia substituted Roff for Sailor. After England secured a line-out one minute later, Lewsey got the ball and passed it to Wilkinson (whose second attempt to score a drop goal went wide of the left-hand post). In the 79th minute, Catt was brought on for the injured Tindall. With 90 seconds of regular time remaining, Watson penalised England for collapsing a scrum and Woodman's failure to engage on their line on the right side of the pitch; Woodman felt that Australia engaged too early, but a penalty kick was awarded to Australia. Flatley scored the penalty from out on the right of the England half with ten seconds left, bringing on extra time with the teams tied 14–14.\nExtra time.\nOne minute into extra time, England substituted Vickery for Leonard. England were awarded a penalty kick a minute later, when a line-out Johnson was pulled down by Justin Harrison. Wilkinson opted to take the penalty, and kicked a shot from out wide on the right which went between the posts and put England back in the lead. Larkham came off the pitch again for Giteau because he was still bleeding, and an injured-looking Lewsey came off for Balshaw. Catt unsuccessfully attempted to score a drop goal on 89 minutes because Phil Waugh stopped him with a knock-on. Wilkinson also tried to score a drop goal a minute later, but his shot went wide. This ended the first half of extra time, with England leading Australia 17–14.\nAt 92 minutes, Australia replaced Young with Dunning; England substituted Moody for Hill, who had a cramp, one minute later. Tuqiri was prevented from scoring a try when Cohen and Robinson were tackled from three minutes later; Wilkinson held the ball, giving Australia a line-out. England got a penalty line-out in the 96th minute when Rogers held onto the ball during a tackle. Dallaglio was penalised from coming in on the side and handling the ball in a ruck, giving Australia a penalty kick at 97 minutes. Flatley scored the penalty from outside the England area to level the score 17–17 and, potentially, require a match-ending penalty shootout. With more than one minute remaining, England won a line-out and moved towards Australia's area three times, including a dummy and run by Dawson that broke the line and brought England within drop goal range. Dawson passed the ball to Wilkinson, who could not be stopped by Gregan and scored a right-foot drop goal from out with 28 seconds left to put England back in the lead. No further points were scored; Watson blew the final whistle, with England winning the match 20–17 for their first Rugby World Cup.\nAftermath.\nEngland was the first Northern Hemisphere nation to win the Rugby World Cup, ending 16 years of Southern Hemisphere dominance. IRB chairman Syd Millar presented the runner-up medals to the Australian side. The victorious England team received their medals from Australian Prime Minister John Howard before Johnson held up the Webb Ellis Cup presented to him by Howard. The England team then took a lap of honour around the stadium. Wilkinson was named man of the match and won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award. Every member of England's playing and senior coaching staff was appointed at least a Member of Order of the British Empire in the 2004 New Year Honours. In May 2004, the England squad received the Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year and Woodward was knighted.\nAccording to Woodward, the victory was \"very important and it is just a big thank you to the Premiership clubs and the Rugby Football Union. We have just put the icing on the cake and we want to keep this going.\" His counterpart, Jones, conceded that the better side won the final: \"You slug it out for 100 minutes and get beaten in the 99th – yeah, that would qualify as a photo finish. England were outstanding and are the best team in the world by one minute.\" Wilkinson explained why he scored a drop final in the last minute of the match: \"I didn't want the game to go to a drop-goal competition. I just wanted to win so much for the other guys. I had to make sure I hit the target when the chance came my way.\" In a 2019 interview with BBC Sport, he described the goal as \"not a memory that I treasure because I don't have much memory of it – but just an experience which gave me a glimpse of life a little bit outside the boundaries of what I thought was possible – something bigger.\" Cannon described the drop goal as \"like witnessing a car accident, you know it's about to happen but you don't want it to happen.\"\nDawson said the win was \"very surreal\" after England's comeback from elimination in the quarter-final stage of the 1999 tournament. Greenwood said that during the match and when he received his World Cup winners medal he thought about his son, Freddie, who died shortly after he was born in 2002. Gregan said that although the Australian team were disappointed, they had \"a good deal of pride there as well. It was a gutsy effort, coming down to the last play of the game. My team didn't leave anything out so I couldn't ask for anything more.\" Injured prop Darwin said that he was frustrated to be unable to play in the final. Flatley described the pressure he felt when scoring the two penalty goals which meant that the match would go into extra time: \"I had my hands together praying and I didn't see either kick. I had my eyes closed. It was scary pressure. There wasn't a great deal going on in my head ... I just had to knock them over.\" Although Rogers blamed himself for the loss because he had been unable to clear the ball in the final minute, Flatley told him that he was not to blame: \"A million things go on and in a game like that you can't really put it down to one thing. \"It wasn't like I was about to slit my wrists or anything, but I was hoping to kick it up a bit further and make it even harder for them to score.\"\nWatson's refereeing was criticised by the media and rugby-world figures. Woodward's assistant Andy Robinson asked Watson during the post-match celebrations why England were penalised for scrum infringements, and was told to review the video footage. Watson defended his decisions: \"I was satisfied with my handling of the match and that includes the scrum infringements ... I ref what I see and nothing else and I was happy with my performance. If there were any problems, they will have been noted by the IRB and I have not had any comebacks from them.\"\nThe team left Sydney on the evening of 24 November, and arrived at Heathrow Airport (greeted by 8,000 to 10,000 people) early the next morning. Johnson, holding the trophy, was the first player to appear, and \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\" was sung. A national day of celebration was organised by the Rugby Football Union on 8 December, and was seen by almost a million people. The team paraded in open-top buses from Marble Arch to Trafalgar Square. Ken Livingstone, the Mayor of London, awarded the squad the freedom of Greater London. The team then met the queen and other senior royal family members at Buckingham Palace, followed by a reception at 10 Downing Street with Prime Minister Tony Blair.\nThe match viewership on ITV1 peaked overnight at around 14.5 million (82 percent of the British viewership) between 11:20 and 11:25 am and averaged 12.3 million (a 77 per cent viewing share); it had a final peak rating of 15 million viewers. This was the highest viewership in the United Kingdom of a rugby union match since the 1991 Rugby World Cup Final was watched by an average of 13.6 million. The Seven Network's coverage of the final had a nationwide average of four million viewers in Australia and peaked at a total of 4.3 million viewers, making it the most-watched football game in the history of Australian television. Global audience figures for the 2003 Rugby World Cup final totalled between 22 and 30 million.\nAt the next World Cup, hosted by France in 2007, England reached the final for the third time in tournament history before they were defeated by South Africa 15–6. Australia advanced from their group as winners before they were knocked out in the quarter-final stage by England."

        "text": "Sir Wayne Ross Smith (born 19 April 1957) is a New Zealand rugby union coach and former player. He has won three Rugby World Cups; he was an assistant coach with New Zealand's men's team, the All Blacks, who won the 2011 and 2015 World Cups, and as head coach of the New Zealand women's team, the Black Ferns, won the 2021 World Cup, held in 2022.\nHe was previously the head coach of New Zealand's men's team, the All Blacks (2000–2001), and assistant coach for two spells (2004–11 and 2015–2017).

He studied at Waikato University in Hamilton while playing club rugby in Putaruru, and in 1978 he was on the bench for one top grade Waikato match. \"Frustrated\" after that season, he decided to look for opportunities elsewhere, and moved to Canterbury where Belfast became his second (and final) club.\nSmith played for Canterbury under the leadership of Doug Bruce and Alex Wyllie, and made his international debut in 1980. He played first five-eighth, winning 17 Test caps.\nIn the Rugby Almanack of New Zealand, he was selected as one of the \"Five players of the year\" for the 1984 season.\nCoaching.\nSmith had two spells coaching in Italy, with ASD Rugby Casale (as player-coach, 1986–88) and Benetton Treviso (1992–94).\nHis first major coaching role in New Zealand was for the Crusaders in the Super 12 competition in 1997. He coached them to two titles in 1998 and 1999 before being appointed All Blacks coach after the 1999 Rugby World Cup.\nWith the All Blacks in 2001, Smith was bitterly disappointed after two close losses to Australia, failing to win the Bledisloe Cup from them and finishing second to Australia twice in the 2000 and 2001 Tri Nations. He decided to reapply for his job but John Mitchell was chosen instead.\nSmith went on to coach the Northampton Saints in England. He coached there until being appointed backs coach in early 2004 by then All Blacks' coach Graham Henry.\nIn 2010, All Black scrum half Justin Marshall spoke about the best piece of coaching advice he'd received came from Smith: \"I was going through a bad patch and he told me to go out and trust my instincts and be decisive – you need to trust what you do is going to be the right thing and if you do it decisively you'll make good of it even if it's the wrong option because you'll do it with purpose. That's the best piece of advice I've been given.\"\nSmith took up the assistant coaching position at the New Zealand Super Rugby team the Chiefs in 2012. That year the Chiefs won their first Super Rugby title by defeating the Sharks 37–6 in the final. In August 2012 Smith declared he wanted to stay with the Chiefs, despite being approached by the Western Force and NSW Waratahs, and an offer from England.\nSmith rejoined the All Blacks' coaching staff in 2015, ahead of the 2015 Rugby World Cup, which New Zealand won.\nOn 19 May 2017 Smith announced he would be stepping down as assistant coach at the conclusion of the 2017 Rugby Championship in October, after over 200 games as a coach of the All Blacks since 2004, and retiring from full-time coaching.

        "text": "The Vanuatu national rugby union team represents Vanuatu in the sport of rugby union. The team is classified as a tier three nation by the International Rugby Board (IRB), and has yet to qualify for a Rugby World Cup. Its international debut was in 1966. It became affiliated with World Rugby in 1999. The team is nicknamed the Tuskers, after the pig tusks prized as currency in some parts of the country. The tusks also appear on the country's flag. \nHistory.\nVanuatu was involved in the Oceania qualifying tournaments for the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France. It was a part of the Round 1a group, with the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. It won its first match at home against the Solomon Islands, lost the second match away to Papua New Guinea 97 to 3, and did not proceed to the next round.\nRecord.\nOverall.\nIn late 2012, due to management issues, the Vanuatu rugby team was suspended by the IRB for failure to report about the country's use of money and development of the sport within the country."

        "title": "1919 English cricket season",
        "text": "1919 was the 26th season of County Championship cricket in England and the first since 1914. The authorities had doubted if cricket would remain popular after a four-year break and the strain of war. It was decided that County Championship matches should be reduced from three days' duration to two, but cricket had not lost its popularity and the two-day experiment was a failure. Yorkshire finished the season as champions, topping the table by four percentage points. No Test cricket was played but an Australian Imperial Forces team toured England, playing matches from mid-May until mid-September. Andy Ducat, Patsy Hendren, Percy Holmes, Herbert Sutcliffe and Ernest Tyldesley were named in the 1920 edition of \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" as the Five Cricketers of the Year for their 1919 performances.\nCounty Championship.\nThe 1919 tournament was hurriedly arranged in the aftermath of the Armistice of 11 November 1918. A key meeting of the county clubs took place at Lord's on Wednesday, 5 February. Fearing that cricket might have lost its popularity since 1914, they decided by a consensus of eleven against five to restrict matches to a two-day duration instead of three, but with longer hours of play. \"Wisden\" editor Sydney Pardon led the chorus of disapproval, saying: \"I have a very strong opinion that a grave mistake has been made in not letting the game alone. The restriction of all county matches to two days strikes me as being a sad blunder\". Pardon went on to suggest that the County Championship should be \"dropped entirely for one year\" to allow a reasonable period for post-war recovery.\nThe sixteen clubs had to arrange their own fixtures at quite short notice and this was done with variable success. Yorkshire played 26 matches and Lancashire 24 but, at the other extreme, Northamptonshire and Somerset played only twelve apiece while Worcestershire decided not to compete at all. The February meeting had decided to order the tournament on the basis of \"percentage of wins to matches played\" but, with the disparity in matches played, the final table could easily have presented a false picture. As it was, Yorkshire were awarded the title after winning twelve of their twenty-six matches for a percentage of 46.15%. They were closely followed by Kent, who had 42.85%. Kent, however, played only fourteen matches and, on the final day of the season, they were within one wicket (in a drawn match) of taking the title. Roy Webber said it was \"just\" that Yorkshire finished top given the number of matches played by each county. Nottinghamshire were third with 35.71% (five wins from fourteen) and Warwickshire were bottom with 7.14% (one win from fourteen).\nThe 1919 County Championship was the 26th since the competition acquired official status in 1890. The opening matches began on Friday, 16 May. These were Middlesex v Nottinghamshire at Lord's and the 1914 (reigning) champions Surrey against Somerset at The Oval. The final match between Essex and Surrey at Leyton was completed on Monday, 1 September.\nThe situation between Yorkshire and Kent on Saturday, 30 August (the second day in both of their final games), was that three title outcomes were possible: if both won they would share the title; if one won and the other did not then the winning team would be champions; if neither won then Yorkshire would be champions. Yorkshire were playing Sussex at Hove and there had been a first day washout so there was little hope of a result with only one day's play possible and the match was drawn. This meant that a win for Kent over Middlesex at Lord's would give them the title. Some play was possible on the first day and Kent were 97 for one overnight in their first innings, having won the toss and decided to bat. They reached 196 and then bowled Middlesex out for 87, forcing them to follow on. Thanks, however, to stubborn resistance by Patsy Hendren and Frank Mann, Middlesex were a tougher nut to crack in their second innings and they held on for the draw. At the close, Middlesex were just twelve runs ahead with one wicket standing.\nThe final table was as follows. There was no points system and placings were determined by the percentage of wins to matches played. \nThe two-day experiment failed because, given good weather and batting conditions, the majority of matches could not be completed and were drawn. Pardon and his supporters were proved right and, in an Advisory County Committee meeting at Lord's on Monday, 8 December, the main decision taken was to restore the three-day format for the 1920 championship.\nIn his 1919 editorial, Pardon also complained about a plethora of ideas for reform that were appearing in the newspapers. He argued: \"So far as I know the game was flourishing, when in August 1914 the world was suddenly turned upside down. Be this as it may, the resumption of first-class matches was no sooner announced than all the faddists in Great Britain began to fill the newspapers with their ideas of what they were pleased to call reform or reconstruction\". Some of the suggestions were dismissed by Pardon as \"preposterous\" but others needed to be taken more seriously, such as one being supported by Stanley Jackson to shorten the boundaries. All except the two-day match were rejected.\nAustralian Imperial Forces tour.\nThe Australian Imperial Forces cricket team played twenty-eight first-class matches in England from mid-May until mid-September. Mostly, they played against county teams, but they also met some representative sides such as the South, H. K. Foster's XI and the Gentlemen. Of their twenty-eight matches, the touring side won twelve and lost four; the other twelve (mostly two-day matches) were drawn. Four of the Australian Imperial Forces team passed 1,000 runs during their tour, led by Carl Willis, who accrued 1,652 runs at an average of 41.30. Jack Gregory was the leading wicket-taker for the tourists, claiming 131 wickets.\nStatistical leaders.\nJack Hobbs was the leading run-scorer in first-class cricket during the season, amassing 2,594 runs at an average of 60.32 during 30 matches for Surrey and the Players. He was the only batsman to exceed 2,000 runs in the year, and was one of 31 to score 1,000 runs or more. Two of those, George Gunn and Patsy Hendren finished the year with a superior batting average to Hobbs; Gunn scored his 1,451 runs at 63.08, while Hendren's 1,655 runs came at 61.29.\nTen bowlers took 100 or more wickets during 1919, led by Wilfred Rhodes, who claimed 164. Among those who took 100 wickets, Rhodes also had the best bowling average, claiming his wickets at 14.42. He was trailed in this statistic by Jack White, who took 128 wickets at 14.94, though Bill Hitch, Johnny Douglas and Jack Gregory all took more wickets than White."

        "text": "The 1945 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was cancelled on April 24 after the Major League Baseball (MLB) season began on April 17. The July 10 game was cancelled due to wartime travel restrictions in World War II. 1945 is the first of two years since 1933, when the first official All-Star Game was played, that an All-Star Game was cancelled and All-Stars were not officially selected.\nThis was to have been the 13th annual playing of the \"Midsummer Classic\" by MLB's American League (AL) and National League (NL) All-Star teams. The game was to be played at Fenway Park, home of the AL's Boston Red Sox. Fenway Park was chosen for the 1946 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (13th \"Midsummer Classic\") which was played on July 9 of that year.\nOn July 9 and 10, 1945, seven out of eight scheduled interleague night games were advertised and played as \"All-Star\" games in place of the official All-Star Game during the three-day All-Star break to help support the American Red Cross and the National War Fund. Four of the exhibition games were played on July 10 in Washington, D.C., St. Louis, Philadelphia, and Boston.\nGermany had surrendered in May 1945. Mike Todd, a Broadway producer, had passed on the idea of holding the 1945 All-Star Game in Nuremberg, at a stadium renamed \"Soldier Field\" where U.S. troops stationed in the European Theater played baseball. Although baseball's new commissioner, Happy Chandler was reportedly \"intrigued\" by the idea, it was ultimately dismissed as impractical by military advisors. The next time an All-Star game got cancelled was the 2020 game due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.\nMLB All-Stars (none).\nNo MLB players were officially named to the All-Star teams in 1945, due to the cancellation of the All-Star Game. The All-Star rosters for the AL and NL All-Star teams were to have been selected by each All-Star squad's manager (from 1935 through 1946), which did not occur that season.\nThe \"Sporting News\" All-Star Team.\nThe \"Sporting News\" (TSN) named an annual major league All-Star Team from 1925 to 1961 (from 1961 to present an American and National League team is named) from a Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWA) members ballot.\nThe \"Sporting News\" All-Star Team made up of eleven members (one player in \"italics\" has since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame), is shown here:\nAssociated Press and The \"Sporting News\" (Fred Lieb) All-Stars.\nA group of sportswriters of the Associated Press (AP) did name 40 AL and NL All-Stars in 1945, after taking nominations from 13 of the 16 MLB managers that season. The managers who did not participate were Joe McCarthy of the New York Yankees, Luke Sewell of the St. Louis Browns, and Billy Southworth of the St. Louis Cardinals. Sewell (AL) and Southworth (NL) were the 1944 pennant championship team's managers and were to have managed the 1945 All-Star Game teams. Although Sewell could not officially select anyone for the AL All-Star roster, he listed his personal AL All-Stars as pitcher Dave Ferriss of the Red Sox and third baseman Tony Cuccinello of the White Sox.\nFred Lieb a sportswriter for the \"Sporting News\" (TSN) also wrote an article in the July 12, 1945, issue selecting 40 All-stars for the two All-Star teams, even naming starting position players and three possible starting pitchers. Some of Lieb's selections are different than the AP selections. The annual TSN All-Stars list is released after the season. Tigers catcher, Paul Richards is the only annual TSN All-Star not in the AP and Lieb selections for 1945.\nThe AP sportswriters and Lieb's (TSN) All-Star rosters (6 of the players in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame) are shown here:\nNational League.\nNote.\nThose selected for the Associated Press and or the \"Sporting News\" (Fred Lieb) All-Star rosters who had not been an official MLB All-Star before and after the 1945 season are:"

        "title": "NRL Grand Final",
        "text": "The NRL Grand Final determines the champions of the National Rugby League club competition. It is a major sport event in Australia. Since 1999, it has been contested at Stadium Australia in Sydney. The first year it was held at Stadium Australia, it set a new record for attendance at an Australian rugby league game, with 107,999 people attending.\nThe grand final had been played on Saturday afternoons and then Sunday afternoons. From 2001 to 2007, the game was moved to an evening start to make the most of prime time television. Between 2008 and 2012, a compromise was reached between official broadcaster Nine Network's preferred starting time of 7pm and the traditional starting time of 3pm, with the grand final beginning at 5pm AEDT. In 2013, the evening start resumed and has occurred since. Previously, the grand final did not have a set date but, with the exception of 2020, since 2001, it has been played the Sunday falling between 30 September and 6 October, preceding the Labour Day public holiday on the first Monday of October.\nThe NRL Grand Final Breakfast, attended by both teams, NRL officials and guests is held during the week before the game and screened live on Australian television. In 2015, the breakfast was cancelled and has been held only intermittently in recent years.\nThe game itself is usually preceded by an opening ceremony featuring entertainment and the singing of the national anthem by well-known Australasian and international musical acts. The Provan-Summons Trophy, the NRL's premiership trophy, is usually delivered to the field by an Australian Army helicopter shortly before kick off. At the conclusion of the grand final there is a presentation ceremony where the winning team are awarded premiership rings. The player judged to be the man-of-the-match by the selectors of the ARL national team is awarded the prestigious Clive Churchill Medal and the Prime Minister of Australia is typically on-hand to hand the Provan-Summons Trophy to the winning captain.\nIn 2019, the Government of New South Wales secured the grand final for Stadium Australia until at least 2046.\nHistory.\nFirst grade rugby league in NSW began in 1908, the first premiership deciding game was played at the Royal Agricultural Society Showground, with Souths defeating Easts 14–12. From 1912 to 1925, no finals system was in place, however in 1916, 1922, 1923 and 1924, a match was played as a tiebreaker to decide the season's premiership winner. From 1926 to 1953, finals were played under the Argus system, which produced a deciding game in two slightly differing ways.\nAll of these deciding games are now deemed to be grand finals, whether they were referred to as such at the time or not. From 1954 to the present, using a variety of systems, the deciding match has been explicitly termed a grand final, and no distinction is made between grand finals played under the auspices of the various governing bodies.\nStadiums.\nThe NRL grand final is traditionally held in Sydney, as most NRL clubs are based in there and the current venue for the grand final, Stadium Australia is the second highest capacity stadium in Australia, after the Melbourne Cricket Ground.\nIt was announced in June 2019 that the 2020 and 2021 Grand Finals would be played at the Sydney Cricket Ground, while Stadium Australia underwent redevelopment. However, after the Government of New South Wales scrapped plans to redevelop Stadium Australia in July 2020, the matches would return to being planned at Stadium Australia until at least 2046.\nIn 2021, the NRL Grand Final was played at Lang Park in Brisbane, as it was not possible for the match to be played at Stadium Australia due to the COVID-19 lockdown in New South Wales. It was the first major rugby league grand final to be played in Queensland since the 1997 Super League grand final.\nQualification for World Club Challenge.\nThe winners of the grand final qualify to play the winners of the Super League Grand Final in the World Club Challenge.\nTrophy and awards.\nProvan-Summons Trophy.\nThe Provan-Summons Trophy is the NRL's main prize, awarded to the team that wins the premiership. Its sculptured design is similar to the Winfield Cup trophy, which was introduced for the 1982 NSWRFL season. It is a three-dimensional cast of a famous photo called \"The Gladiators\", which depicts a mud-soaked Norm Provan of St. George and Arthur Summons of Western Suburbs embracing after the 1963 NSWRFL season's grand final. It was not officially named the Provan-Summons Trophy until 2013, the 50th anniversary of the 1963 grand final. The trophy is awarded following each grand final to the captain of the winning club.\nClive Churchill Medal.\nThe Clive Churchill Medal is the award given to the player judged to be man-of-the-match in the National Rugby League's annual grand final. The award was created to honour Clive Churchill, one of the greatest rugby league players in Australian history, following his death in 1985. A prestigious honour in the NRL, the medal's recipient is chosen by the selectors of the Australian national team and announced and awarded to the player judged best and fairest on the ground at every post-grand final ceremony.\nThe Clive Churchill Medal has been awarded ever since the 1986 NSWRL season when its first recipient was Parramatta's Peter Sterling. The only three players to have won the award more than once are Canberra's Bradley Clyde (1989 and 1991), Melbourne Storm's Billy Slater (2009 and 2017) and Penrith Panthers' Nathan Cleary (2021 and 2023). In 2010, the Melbourne Storm were stripped of the 2007 and 2009 premierships due to salary cap breaches exposed by the NRL, however the Clive Churchill Medallists from those years still continue to be recognised.\nPremiership rings.\nThe NRL present premiership rings for the players and coach of grand final winning sides. After the 2004 NRL Grand Final which was won by the Bulldogs, one of their players, Johnathan Thurston gave his premiership ring to teammate Steve Price who missed the decider due to injury. The Melbourne Storm were stripped of their premierships in 2007 and 2009, but the players involved in those premierships were still allowed to keep their premiership rings. In 2014 NRL premiership ring was worth $8000 made by Zed N Zed Jewellery. Since 2015, Affinity Diamonds have produced the NRL premiership rings\nPrize money.\nPrize money of AUD$400,000 is awarded to the victorious club.\nHowever the amount is probably not reflective of the magnitude of participating in the event. It is often assumed simply that the winner of the premiership typically experiences an increase in revenue through increases in membership and merchandise sales.\nResults.\n1Reduced crowd due to stadium capacity restrictions\nThe 2021 Grand Final was held in Brisbane for the first time in the competition's history due to an ongoing COVID-19 lockdown in New South Wales which prompted the NRL to relocate it from Stadium Australia in Sydney, where every NRL Grand Final since 1999 had been hosted. \nDue to COVID-19 restrictions, the match was attended by only 39,322 spectators because the Government of Queensland limited Lang Park to seventy-five percent of its maximum capacity.\nWinners.\nThe Gold Coast Titans and Dolphins are the only teams currently competing in the competition who have not featured in a grand final since the start of the NRL (1998).\nTelevision broadcast.\nThe match is always broadcast on free-to-air television in Australia, with live rights currently held by the Nine Network. Exclusive replay rights for the 12 hours following the game are held by subscription channel Fox League and streaming service Kayo Sports.\nNotable grand finals.\n1909 – South Sydney win the premiership by forfeit over Balmain. There was an agreement that both sides would play the match; however, Balmain never showed up, and South Sydney kicked off to a side that did not turn up, scored a try and were declared premiers.\n1924 – Balmain defeat South Sydney 3–0 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in the lowest-scoring grand final of all time.\n1943 – Newtown defeat North Sydney 34–7 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in front of a then record crowd of 60,922. This grand final would be North Sydney's final appearance in a decider before exiting the competition in 1999 and also Newtown's last premiership before their exclusion at the end of 1983.\n1952 – Western Suburbs defeated South Sydney 22–10. The match was remembered due to its controversy with claims the referee George Bishop had put a big wager on Western Suburbs winning the game. Souths claimed that they were denied two fair tries and Wests had scored one try off a blatant knock on. Western Suburbs player Hec Farrell was sent off in the second half of the match. This would prove to be the last premiership Western Suburbs would win as a stand-alone entity before exiting the competition in 1999. South Sydney captain-coach Jack Rayner reportedly never spoke to George Bishop following the grand final, even though both men lived in the same suburb of Sydney for years after the match.\n1956 – St. George beat Balmain to claim the first of a world record 11 straight premierships.\n1963 – St. George beat Western Suburbs 8–3 in a match famous for the iconic 'Gladiators' photo of Norm Provan and Arthur Summons covered in mud. It is also notable for a controversial try scored by Dragons winger Johnny King. Wests players tackled him and believed him to be held; however, the referee ruled play on.\n1965 – A then record crowd of 78,056 packed into the Sydney Cricket Ground to see St. George captain Norm Provan play his last NSWRFL game. It was also St. George's 10th straight premiership.\n1966 – St. George win their 11th straight premiership, at the time a world record in any football code.\n1969 – Balmain win a controversial grand final 11–2 over South Sydney. The game causes controversy due to Balmain's lay down tactics.\n1975 – Eastern Suburbs beat St. George by a then record 38–0 score line. St. George fullback Graeme Langlands plays the game in white boots and has a painkiller injection go wrong.\n1977 – St. George and Parramatta play out the first drawn grand final, 9-all after extra time. They come back the next week for a grand final replay and St. George win 22–0.\n1978 – Manly and Cronulla play out the second consecutive drawn grand final, 11–11. There is no extra time and the replay is played on the following Tuesday, won by Manly 16–0.\n1987 – Manly defeat Canberra 18–8 in the last grand final played at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\n1989 – Known by many as the best grand final ever—a year coincidentally believed to be the greatest by some, Canberra come from 14–2 down to beat Balmain 19–14 in extra time. Canberra became the first team outside of NSW to win the competition.\n1992 – The Brisbane Broncos defeat St. George 28–8 to become the first Queensland team to win the grand final.\n1997 – Brisbane defeat Cronulla for their third premiership in the Super League grand final. This was the first night grand final, the first top level rugby league grand final to be played outside of Sydney before a record crowd for any sporting event in Queensland of 58,912.\n1997 – Newcastle winger Darren Albert scored a try with six seconds left to deliver Newcastle their first ever premiership, 22–16 over Manly.\n1999 – A record crowd of 107,999 watch the two newest clubs Melbourne Storm and St George Illawarra Dragons battle it out. St. George Illawarra led 18–14 before a late penalty try to Melbourne winger Craig Smith gave the Storm a 20–18 win to become the first Victorian team to win a NRL premiership and the quickest NRL club to win their first-ever premiership, which they accomplished in only their second season.\n2001 – Newcastle win the first night grand final in Sydney, 30–24 over Parramatta.\n2002 – Pre-game entertainment Billy Idol arrived on ground on board a hovercraft, but due to technical issues – \"waiting for some power\" – he did not perform. It was also the first year that a New Zealand–based team played in a grand final, making this the first Trans-Tasman grand final.\n2005 – Wests Tigers five-eighth Benji Marshall throws a magic flick pass to winger Pat Richards as the Tigers become the first joint venture to win the premiership, 30–16 over the North Queensland Cowboys.\n2008 – Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles secure a record 40–0 win over Melbourne Storm.\n2011 – Lights at the stadium accidentally go out, causing the post-game ceremony to become delayed.\n2014 – South Sydney Rabbitohs win their first premiership in 43 years, beating Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs 30–6.\n2015 – The North Queensland Cowboys' first premiership after 21 seasons in the NRL and widely regarded as one of the all-time best (along with the Raiders' 1989 win). The first all-Queensland NRL grand final sparked talk of future deciders being held in Queensland. It was also notable as Brisbane Broncos ended their biggest drought from a grand final since entering the competition (in 1988) and it was Bennett's first season back in Brisbane after leaving in 2008. North Queensland Cowboys winger Kyle Feldt scored a try from a Michael Morgan try-assist after the full-time siren to level the game at 16–16. After Jonathan Thurston missed the sideline conversion, hitting the right post, the match went to golden point extra time, the first grand final to do so. The Kyle Feldt kick-off to begin golden point was dropped by the Broncos' Ben Hunt. From the ensuing set of six, Thurston kicked the winning field goal, and he was subsequently awarded the Clive Churchill Medal. It also ended Brisbane's undefeated streak in grand finals, having won all six previous deciders.\n2016 – Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks win their first premiership in their 50th season by defeating Melbourne Storm 14–12. This was also only their fourth grand final appearance since entering the competition in 1967. Their other grand final appearances came in 1973, 1978 and 1997 Super League Grand Final. The Sharks won only one of their final five regular-season games. However, it was enough to break through for their inaugural premiership.\n2019 – Sydney Roosters become the first team to win back-to-back premierships in 26 years by defeating the Canberra Raiders 14–8. The last team to achieve successive premierships in a unified competition was the Brisbane Broncos in 1992–93. The Roosters' win did not come without any controversy during the game. In the third minute, a Luke Keary kick was charged down, only for the ball to ricochet off the head of the Roosters' trainer who was on the field at the time; a scrum feed was then awarded to the Roosters, and 3 minutes later Roosters' Sam Verrills scored a try adjacent to the goalposts. The Raiders then started to dominate the match, with their five-eighth Jack Wighton scoring a try in the 31st minute. Roosters' Cooper Cronk was sent to the sin bin for 10 minutes for a professional foul (tackling a player not in possession of the football). With a man down, the Roosters' defence was stoic; despite numerous attacks, the Raiders were unable to score. The 72nd minute saw what was arguably one of the most controversial moments in a rugby league match (let alone for a NRL grand final): A Jack Wighton bomb kick saw the ball bounce off the shoulder off a Raiders player (who was contesting the ball against the Roosters' fullback James Tedesco) and the ball bounced back to the Raiders. Initially, the head referee Ben Cummins believed that the ball was touched by Tedesco and subsequently Cummins called that the Raiders had another set of six tackles while the ball was still in play; however, Cummins was quickly notified by other match officials that the Roosters had not touched the ball, and, as such, the Raiders were still on their last tackle. Wighton was tackled, and despite his protests to the referees, handed the ball over to the Roosters. Four tackles later, the Roosters ran 80 metres, the ball passing between Keary, Latrell Mitchell, Daniel Tupou, and finally Tedesco, who scored the match-winning try.\n2020 – Contested on 25 October, three weeks later than originally scheduled due to the season being suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n2021 – The NRL Grand Final was played at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane, the first time ever outside of Sydney, as it was not possible for the match to be played at Stadium Australia due to the COVID-19 lockdown in New South Wales.\n2023 - Penrith Panthers become the first team in 40 years, and the first in the modern NRL era to win three premierships in a row (2021, 2022 and 2023). This is titled the rare three peat.\nAudience.\nThe 1999 NRL Grand Final saw a new rugby league world record crowd of 107,999, which was achieved at Stadium Australia. The attendance, which saw 67,142 more people attend than had done so for the 1998 NRL Grand Final at the Sydney Football Stadium the year before, broke the record attendance for a grand final by nearly 30,000 people, with the previous record of 78,065 being set in 1965 when St George defeated South Sydney 12–8 at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\nThe 2014 NRL Grand Final had a crowd of 83,833, which was the largest attendance at a sporting event at Stadium Australia since its 2001 reconfiguration.\nEntertainment.\nEarly NRL grand finals featured a halftime show consisting of marching bands; but, as the popularity of the game increased, a trend started where popular singers and musicians performed during its pre-game ceremonies, and thus the modern halftime show emerged. Traditionally, the Australia's national anthem, \"Advance Australia Fair\", is sung before every match. When the New Zealand Warriors play, \"God Defend New Zealand\" is also sung."

        "title": "Group 17 Rugby League",
        "text": "Group 17 is a rugby league competition based in the Riverina and Central West regions of New South Wales, Australia. The competition collapsed in 2006 and reformed in 2018 as the Western Riverina Community Cup with six teams.\nThe season runs from mid-May to late July, and features a knockout, six regular season rounds, and a three week finals series culminating in the Grand Final which is hosted by a different team each year.\nHistory.\nEarly History.\nGroup 17 was formed in 1935 and originally centred around Griffith and Leeton, but was suspended during World War II. However, when rugby league returned to normal competition after the war, Leeton, along with Griffith, Yenda, Yanco and others, joined the Wagga Wagga competition, Group 20. Group 20 later became the Griffith and District competition after the Wagga clubs joined Group 9.\nRugby league in the Western Riverina district began as an inter-town competition between Hillston, Merriwagga, Goolgowi and Hay. The competition was suspended during World War 2.\nIt reformed in 1947 as the 'Western Zone' with teams from Hay, Darlington Point, Goolgowi, Carrathool and two teams from Hillston, 'Town' and 'Country'. Tullibigeal joined during the 1950s, and won the 1965 Clayton Cup, the Country Rugby League's highest honour, but later departed to form the TLU Sharks with Lake Cargelligo in Group 20. In 1959, the league became known as \"Group 17\", and featured two zones, with Zone 1 being centred around Hillston and Zone 2 around Hay.\n1968 Clayton Cup \"Final\".\nAfter both Euabalong and Darlington Point finished the 1968 season undefeated in Zones 1 and 2 respectively, and were left as the only two undefeated teams in the state, administrators were unsure of which side were more deserving of the coveted Clayton Cup as the best team in the Country Rugby League. The idea of settling who was the best overall Group 17 side had been resolved with a playoff match in the past, such as when Zone 1 side Tullibigeal defeated Hay (Zone 2) in 1967. Thus, a playoff final to determine the overall Group 17 Premier, and also the Clayton Cup winner, was set down for the 29th of September 1968 at Goolgowi.In a one-way encounter, the Darlington Point Red &amp; Blacks completed a 20-0 shutout of the Euabalong Tigers side, were awarded the Clayton Cup, and settled the annual dispute over which of the two zones was stronger. The match remains the only one of its kind to this day, which is significant given that the Clayton Cup has been awarded annually since 1937, and various other tiebreakers have been used on every other occasion two teams finish with identical records as the best team in the state.\nDarlington Point were considered too strong for the competition after the result and joined Group 20 the following year in 1969.\n1970s-2006.\nIn around 1969-70 the two Group 17 \"Zones\" merged to form a single competition. Tullibigeal also left around this time and merged with Lake Cargelligo to form a combined side known as Tullibigeal-Lakes United in Group 20.\nThe Deniliquin Blue Heelers were the dominant force in the early 1970s winning three consecutive premierships from 1969-1971, before folding in 1975. Coleambally also left in 1972 and merged with Darlington Point to form a combined club in Group 20 known as the DPC Roosters.\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, the competition sustained a decent standard, with eight clubs participating. More Clayton Cups were won by Group 17 clubs, with Rankins Springs (1993), Barellan (1999 and 2002) and Hillston (2006) all claiming the trophy. But by the 2000s, the Millennial Drought had caused many of the teams to be weakened, due to farming, the primary industry in the region, becoming not only unprofitable, but almost impossible. The competition collapsed after the 2006 season.\nWestern Riverina Community Cup Era (2018-present).\nThe competition was revived in 2018 as the Group 17 Western Riverina Community Cup, with six teams participating. The format involved a knockout and five rounds followed by semi-finals and a grand final. In each round, all three games were played at the same venue, similar to the NRL's Magic Round concept. The season increased to six games the following year, where it has remained.\nClubs.\nPrevious Clubs.\nPast participants in the Group 17 competition included:\nBold indicates that the club fielded a team in the 2006 First-Grade competition.\nGrand Finals.\nThe use of (*) indicates that the premiers for that season won the Clayton Cup as the premier team in NSWCRL competitions statewide (regionally, excludes Sydney) for that year."

Originally scheduled for 2001, the games were postponed in the wake of the 9/11 attacks on the United States in which the US later declared Pakistan a major non-NATO ally. The slogan for the Games was \"Rising Above\". For the first time, Afghanistan participated in the games.\nPostponements.\nThe games in Islamabad were originally to be held from 6 to 15 October 2001, but they were inevitably rescheduled (with the location remaining unchanged) for 30 March 2002 due to the invasion of Afghanistan. They were postponed again due to tensions between Pakistan and India. They were the set to be held from 29 March to 6 April 2003. Afghanistan was invited for the games, however Bhutan and India withdrew.\nThe entire event was postponed for the third time due to the war against Iraq. Pakistan retained the organisational authority, despite Sri Lanka being offered to host the games for 2004. Nevertheless, the honour was returned to Sri Lanka as they were given the 10th edition for 2006 instead. The 9th edition was then rescheduled in Pakistan, for 29 March through 7 April 2004. Despite not entering in the previous schedule, Bhutan and India now entered, though the Maldives withdrew from the football tournament.\nThe Games.\nParticipating nations.\nThe following eight countries competed."

Nicknamed The White Flowers (\"Edelweiss\"), is considered one of the stronger tier 3 teams in European rugby and currently compete in the second division of the Rugby Europe International Championships in the Rugby Europe Trophy, a competition which is just below the Rugby Europe Championship where the top 6 countries in Europe (apart from the teams in the 6 nations) compete. They are yet to participate in any Rugby World Cup and often play in all red while their alternative kit is all white.\nHistory.\nSwitzerland played their first ever international rugby match on April 11, 1973 in Neuchâtel against Portugal, losing 23–4. The following year they lost 10–18 to Belgium, and were then defeated by them 33–3 in 1975. After the second lost to Belgium, Switzerland won their first international rugby match; defeating Serbia-Montenegro 12–3 in Geneva. The only other win for Switzerland during the 1970s was a 7–4 victory over Luxembourg in 1977. In 1979 they were defeated 43–0 by Morocco and 31–0 by Portugal.\nThey however bounced back in 1980, defeating Luxembourg 10–7 in Berne, though they then lost close matches against Sweden and Belgium, and were again held to nil by Portugal in 1981, but got a victory over Denmark later that year. After losing to Belgium and Sweden in 1982, they then scored 60 unanswered points against Finland. They then lost nine games in a row from 1982 to 1986, then defeating Serbia-Montenegro 5–0 in May 1986.\nIn 1989, Switzerland attempted to qualify for the 1991 Rugby World Cup in England, playing in the European tournament – Round 2A. They finished third in the final standings of the round, winning one of their three fixtures. Switzerland also participated in the qualifying tournaments for the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa, making it past the preliminary round from the west group, but not advancing past Round 1.\nSwitzerland finished third (out of six nations) in Pool 1 of Round 1 of the European qualification tournaments for the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales, winning and drawing one game out of four fixtures. Switzerland had more success in the qualifying tournaments for the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia, finishing at the top of Pool B in Round 1 and advancing to Round 2, but were unable to advance to Round 3. In attempting to qualify for the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France, Switzerland finished fourth in Pool D of Round 2 of the European qualification process.\nSwitzerland also failed to qualify for the 2011 or 2015 Rugby World Cups.\nIn 2016 Switzerland reached the second division (Rugby Europe Trophy, formerly Division 1B) of the ENC for the first time since the divisional structure was implemented in 2000, after winning Division 2A over the 2014-16 two-year cycle.\nRecord.\nOverall.\n\"Switzerland national rugby union team results as of 13 April 2024, following match against Ukraine.\" \nCurrent squad.\nThe following players have been selected for the 2022–23 Rugby Europe Trophy.\nCaps update: 22 November 2021\nCurrent coaching staff.\nThe current coaching staff of the Swiss national team:"

Formed as Ossington Golf Club in 1887, the first course was at Holmes Farm in Kilmarnock. The Club quickly became Kilmarnock Golf Club. The club moved to Barassie in the 1890s.\nThe town of Kilmarnock boasts a proud sporting heritage with some of the oldest football, rugby, cricket and bowling clubs in Scotland and the UK. (See Kilmarnock FC, Kilmarnock RFC)\nThe course itself is an Open Championship Final Qualifying venue, and has undergone considerable changes over the past few years. It has 27 holes, and also has much improved facilities in the clubhouse and professional's shop run by Gregor Howie.\nThe additional nine holes are part of the championship course and have added a different dimension to Barassie with a par of 72 and a Standard Scratch of 74. The course measures at just under 7,000 yards and the new holes provide some challenges, perhaps no more so than the par-3 fourth hole or the quirky double dog-leg par-5 eighth.\nThe course was host for The Amateur Championship in June 2001 along with Prestwick Golf Club and played host to the European Youths Championships the previous year. The Open Championship at Royal Troon in 2004 and 2016 saw Barassie play host to the Junior Open Championship.\nWell-known members include Jim Milligan and Gordon Sherry who played in successful Walker Cup teams and Alan Reid who won the Scottish Amateur Stroke Play Championship. Milligan was Scottish Amateur champion in 1988 whilst Sherry was The Amateur champion in 1995. Alasdair Watt was Scottish Amateur runner-up in 1987, losing to Colin Montgomerie of Royal Troon Golf Club. John Montgomerie won the Scottish Amateur in the 1950s. The club is also producing some good young members including David Wilson, Jack McDonald, Euan Walker and Callum Gorrie who have all represented Scotland. As well as being Scottish Club Champions, Barassie have also been European Club Champions in the 1990s."

First played in 1903, the World Series championship is a best-of-seven playoff and is a contest between the champions of baseball's National League (NL) and American League (AL). Often referred to as the \"Fall Classic\", the modern World Series has been played every year since 1903 with two exceptions: in 1904, when the NL champion New York Giants declined to play the AL champion Boston Americans; and in 1994, when the series was canceled due to the players' strike. The best-of-seven style has been the format of all World Series except in 1903, 1919, 1920, 1921, when the winner was determined through a best-of-nine playoff. Although the large majority of contests have been played entirely during the month of October, a small number of Series have also had games played during September and November. The Series-winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy. Players, coaches and others associated with the team are generally given World Series rings to commemorate their victory; however, they have received other items such as pocket watches and medallions in the past. The winning team is traditionally invited to the White House to meet the President of the United States.\nA total of 119 World Series have been contested through 2023, with the AL champion winning 68 and the NL champion winning 51. The New York Yankees of the AL have played in 40 World Series, winning 27 – the most championship appearances and most victories by any team amongst the major North American professional sports leagues. The Dodgers of the NL have the most losses with 14, while the Yankees have the most losses among AL teams with 13. The St. Louis Cardinals have won 11 championships, the most championships among NL clubs and second-most all-time behind the Yankees, and have made 19 total appearances, third-most among NL clubs. The Dodgers have represented the NL the most in the World Series with 21 appearances. The Seattle Mariners are the only MLB franchise that has never appeared in a World Series; the Milwaukee Brewers, San Diego Padres, Tampa Bay Rays, and Colorado Rockies have all played in the Series but have never won it. The Los Angeles Angels and Washington Nationals are the only teams who have won their only World Series appearance, and the Toronto Blue Jays and Miami Marlins are the only teams with multiple World Series appearances with no losses. The Toronto Blue Jays are the only franchise from outside the United States to appear in and win a World Series, winning in 1992 and 1993. The Houston Astros are the only franchise to have represented both the NL (2005) and the AL (2017, 2019, 2021, 2022), winning the Series in 2017 and 2022. The current (2023) World Series champions are the Texas Rangers.\nWorld Series results.\nNumbers in parentheses in the table are World Series appearances as of the date of that World Series, and are used as follows:\nSource for this Table\nWorld Series records by franchise.\nIn the sortable table below, teams are ordered first by number of wins, then by number of appearances, and finally by year of first appearance.

        "text": "The 2007 UEFA Champions League final was the final match of the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League, Europe's primary club football competition. The showpiece event was contested between Liverpool of England and Milan of Italy at the Olympic Stadium in Athens, Greece, on 23 May 2007. Liverpool, who had won the competition five times, were appearing in their seventh final. Milan, who had won the competition six times, were appearing in their eleventh final.\nThe final was a rematch of the 2005 final which Liverpool won 3–2 in a penalty shootout, after recovering from a three-goal deficit at half-time to level the score at 3–3 after full-time and extra time. Both teams had to pass through five rounds before they reached the final. They both entered in the third qualifying round and won their respective groups before they reached the knockout stage, where matches were contested over two legs, with a match at each team's home ground. Milan's victories varied from close affairs to comfortable victories. They defeated Celtic by a single goal over two legs, while they beat Manchester United 5–3 on aggregate in the semi-final. Liverpool's matches were mainly all close affairs; they beat defending champions Barcelona on the away goals rule in the first knockout round and beat Chelsea in a penalty shootout in the semi-finals, although they did record a 4–0 aggregate win over PSV in the quarter-finals.\nBefore the match there were ticketing problems because many fans gained entry to the stadium without valid tickets. After the match, a UEFA spokesman accused Liverpool of having the worst fans in Europe, a claim later denied by UEFA president Michel Platini. Watched by a crowd of 63,000, Milan took the lead when Andrea Pirlo's free-kick deflected off Filippo Inzaghi in the first half. Milan extended their lead in the second half when Inzaghi scored a second goal. Liverpool scored a late goal through Dirk Kuyt, but were unable to equalise before the end of the match. Milan won the match 2–1 to win their seventh Champions League.\nRoute to the final.\nMilan.\nMilan qualified for the competition by finishing third in the 2005–06 Serie A. Milan had originally finished second in Serie A, but were docked 30 points for their part in a match-fixing scandal. The original punishment, reduced on appeal, would have barred them from the Champions League altogether. Their opponents in the third qualifying round were Serbian team Red Star Belgrade. Two victories, 1–0 at home and 2–1 away, ensured Milan's passage to the group stage of the Champions League. They were drawn in Group H alongside AEK Athens of Greece, Anderlecht of Belgium and French team Lille. Milan won three matches, drew one and lost two to finish top of the group with 10 points and progress to the knockout stage.\nThey were drawn against Scottish team Celtic. The first leg at Celtic's home ground Celtic Park finished 0–0. The return leg at Milan's home ground the San Siro also finished 0–0 after 90 minutes with Celtic managing to limit the goalscoring opportunities Milan had. However, three minutes into extra time Milan scored when Kaká curled a shot past Celtic goalkeeper Artur Boruc. Celtic were unable to score the away goal they needed to beat Milan, ensuring the Italians progressed to the quarter finals after a 1–0 aggregate victory.\nMilan were drawn against German team Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals. The first leg at the San Siro ended in a 2–2 draw after Bayern had scored an equaliser three minutes into stoppage time. The second leg at Bayern's home ground the Allianz Arena was more comfortable for Milan, as they scored two first half goals to win the match 2–0 and win the tie 4–2 on aggregate. Milan were drawn against English team Manchester United in the semi-finals. The first leg at United's home ground Old Trafford, Kaka scored twice to give Milan a 2–1 lead after Cristiano Ronaldo had scored an early goal. However, two goals from Wayne Rooney in the second half meant United won the first leg 3–2. The second leg at the San Siro saw Milan win 3–0 to progress to the final after a 5–3 aggregate victory.\nLiverpool.\nLiverpool gained entry to the competition after finishing third in the 2005–06 FA Premier League. As a result of that league position, Liverpool entered the Champions League in the third qualifying round, where their opponents were Maccabi Haifa of Israel. Liverpool won the first leg 2–1 at their home ground Anfield and a 1–1 draw in the away leg in Kyiv ensured Liverpool progressed to the group stage of the competition. Liverpool were drawn in Group C alongside French team Bordeaux, Dutch team PSV and Galatasaray of Turkey. After six games including four wins, one draw and one defeat, Liverpool finished top of the group with 13 points to qualify for the knockout stage.\nLiverpool were drawn against defending champions Barcelona in the first knockout round. Before the first leg in Barcelona, there had been a training ground fracas between Craig Bellamy and John Arne Riise. Coincidentally, it was Bellamy and Riise who secured a 2–1 victory for Liverpool, completing a comeback after Deco had given Barcelona the lead. The second leg at Anfield was won 1–0 by Barcelona, however Liverpool progressed to the quarter-finals on the away goals rule, having scored more goals away from home than their opponents.\nTheir opponents in the quarter-finals were PSV, who they had played in the group stage. The first leg at PSV's home ground the Philips Stadion was won 3–0 by Liverpool all but securing their progression to the semi-finals. The second leg at Anfield was not as one-sided, a 1–0 victory for Liverpool ensured they would progress to the semi-finals courtesy of a 4–0 aggregate victory. Their opponents in the semi-finals were fellow English team Chelsea. The first leg at Chelsea's home ground Stamford Bridge was a close affair with Chelsea winning 1–0 courtesy of a first half Joe Cole goal. The second leg at Anfield was similar, however it was Liverpool who won 1–0 courtesy to a Daniel Agger goal. With the teams tied at 1–1 aggregate after 90 minutes and extra time the tie went to a penalty shootout, which Liverpool won 4–1 to progress to the final.\nMatch.\nBackground.\nThe match was Milan's eleventh appearance in the final, and the third since 2003. They had won on six occasions (1963, 1969, 1989, 1990, 1994, 2003), and lost four times (1958, 1993, 1995, 2005). Liverpool were appearing in their seventh final. They had previously won the competition five times (1977, 1978, 1981, 1984, 2005), while they lost the 1985 final to Juventus. \nThe Olympic Stadium in Athens was selected as the venue for the 2007 UEFA Champions League final at the April 2005 meeting of the UEFA Executive Committee in Tallinn, Estonia. The meeting also determined the venues for the 2006 final and the 2006 and 2007 UEFA Cup finals. Shortly before the final, the UEFA Champions League trophy was returned to UEFA by Ludovic Giuly, representing the 2006 winners, Barcelona. UEFA president Michel Platini then presented the trophy to the Mayor of Athens, Nikitas Kaklamanis, so that it might be put on display in and around the city. The stadium had hosted the showpiece event before. The most recent was the 1994 final. Coincidentally Milan were the winners, beating Barcelona 4–0. The other final held at the ground was in 1983, when Hamburg beat Juventus 1–0. The ground had also played host to the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final in 1987, when Ajax beat Lokomotiv Leipzig 1–0.\nAdidas, the official match ball supplier to all major UEFA, FIFA and IOC tournaments, unveiled the official match ball for the 2007 UEFA Champions League final on 9 March 2007, presenting the Adidas Finale Athens. The design of the Adidas Finale Athens was based on the widely recognisable UEFA Champions League Starball logo and was blue and white, representing the colours of the Greek national flag. The final matched two of the top goal-scorers in the competition that season. Milan's Kaká finished on top of the scoring charts with ten goals, and Liverpool's Peter Crouch entered the game tied for third with six goals in total.\nDespite being drawn as the \"home\" team for the match, Milan chose to wear their all-white away strip for the final; they consider that strip to be their \"lucky kit\" (), having won the European Cup five times in those colours. However, Milan had also lost two finals wearing all-white, most recently against Liverpool in 2005. This decision by Milan meant that Liverpool played the final in their traditional home kit of red shirts, red shorts and red socks. Each of Liverpool's five European Cup titles were won in their all-red strip, and two of these came when they were playing against Italian teams who played in all-white.\nMilan fielded the oldest starting eleven ever in a Champions League final, with the average age at 31 years, 34 days, while Paolo Maldini was the oldest outfield player ever to play in the final, in what was his eighth final, at 38 years and 331 days. Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti opted to start striker Filippo Inzaghi, who had missed the 2005 final ahead of Hernán Crespo. Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez opted to field a five-man midfield with Jermaine Pennant and Boudewijn Zenden on the wings, while Steven Gerrard was deployed behind lone striker Dirk Kuyt. Liverpool fielded five of the players that started the 2005 final: Xabi Alonso, Jamie Carragher, Steve Finnan, Steven Gerrard and John Arne Riise.\nOfficials.\nIn May 2007, Herbert Fandel, the German referee was chosen to oversee the final. He was joined by compatriots Carsten Kadach and Volker Wezel as assistant referees, and Florian Meyer as fourth official.\nProblems before the match.\nOut of 63,800 tickets, only 9,000 tickets for the final went on general sale; the remainder were shared between the two teams, who got 17,000 each, and the UEFA family and sponsors, who received 20,800 tickets. This led to some of the problems before the match. While fans were still queuing to gain entry to the stadium, the Greek police informed them that the stadium was full and denied entry to a number of fans who had genuine tickets. UEFA sources said that as many as 5,000 fans either without tickets or brandishing fakes had entered the 74,000-capacity Olympic Stadium. Simultaneously, thousands of fans with genuine tickets were refused entry as police closed the entrance to the ground amid fears that allowing any more to enter could have led to a disaster. The resulting situation became disorderly, with some Liverpool fans attempting to break through checkpoints, set up by the Greek police. Greek riot police used tear gas and batons to disperse the crowd. UEFA spokesman William Gaillard blamed Liverpool fans for causing the problems, stating, \"Milan supporters didn't face the same problems because they didn't behave in the same way\".\nA UEFA report released soon after the final branded Liverpool supporters \"the worst fans in Europe\", with Gaillard stating: \"What other set of fans steal tickets from their fellow supporters or out of the hands of children?\" However, UEFA President Michel Platini later denied that Liverpool fans were the worst behaved in Europe. UEFA was itself criticised for poor ticket-checking procedures and for implementing insufficient measures to deal with the large number of fans. Simon Gass, the British ambassador to Greece, said, \"Clearly there was some element of breakdown where those fake tickets appeared to be legitimate – that's something UEFA must look at.\" Meanwhile, Liverpool co-owner Tom Hicks described UEFA's allocation of 17,000 tickets to each team, knowing that Liverpool would be bringing 40,000 supporters, as \"insane\" and accused Gaillard of blaming Liverpool fans in order to cover up for his own mistakes. UEFA was further criticised by Milan and Liverpool for their lack of provision for the clubs' disabled fans, providing the clubs with only sixteen disabled tickets each.\nFirst half.\nMilan won the toss and Liverpool kicked off. Playing in a 4–2–3–1 formation, Liverpool had the first attack of the match, but Jermaine Pennant could not reach Steven Gerrard's cross-field pass. Milan responded with two low attempts on the Liverpool goal, but Jamie Carragher was able to clear them both. The second clearance led to a corner, from which Milan failed to score. Liverpool had the first chance of the match in the ninth minute. A slip from Milan defender Marek Jankulovski allowed Pennant to run into space, he passed the ball to Dirk Kuyt who passed it back to him, Pennant's subsequent shot was saved by Milan goalkeeper Dida. Minutes later Gerrard won a header which found Pennant, however Gerrard was unable to make decent contact with the ball following Pennant's pass. Milan had their first shot of the match a few minutes later. Kaká received the ball outside the area and moved to his right before shooting, however Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina saved the shot. Liverpool continued to exert pressure leading Milan defender Massimo Oddo to mis-read a cross from Pennant, the ball reached Gerrard whose shot went over the goal.\nLiverpool had another chance in the 27th minute. Frantic defending from Milan to deny the Liverpool forwards a scoring opportunity, led to the ball being passed to Xabi Alonso, whose shot went wide of the Milan goal. A mistake from Jankulovski allowed Gerrard to pass the ball to Kuyt in the penalty area, however Kuyt's shot was blocked by Milan defender Alessandro Nesta. Milan midfielder Gennaro Gattuso was the first player to receive a yellow card, when he was cautioned in the 40th minute for a foul on Alonso. Minutes later, Alonso fouled Kaká on the edge of the Liverpool penalty area, giving away a free-kick. The subsequent free-kick taken by Andrea Pirlo deflected off the shoulder of Milan striker Filippo Inzaghi, and into the Liverpool goal. The deflection resulted in the ball being diverted past Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina, who had dived the other way in anticipation of the ball's original trajectory. Replays showed that the ball struck Inzaghi's upper arm on its way to the goal, but the referee did not judge this to have been a handball. Inzaghi later said that while the deflection was intended, he did not intend for the ball to hit his arm. With no further action in the first half, Milan went into half-time leading 1–0.\nSecond half.\nMilan kicked off the second half. Two minutes into the half, Liverpool had the first attack, but Nesta tackled Gerrard before he could reach Kuyt's pass. Jankulovski received a yellow card in the 54th minute when he brought Pennant down. Immediately afterwards, Milan had an attack. Pirlo received the ball from a header by Clarence Seedorf, Pirlo played a high pass to Kaká who was ruled to be offside by the assistant referee, despite being behind the defence when the ball was played. Milan had another attack straight after the offside, but Liverpool defender Daniel Agger tackled Inzaghi before he could shoot. Liverpool had their first yellow card in the 59th minute when Javier Mascherano received one for bringing down Pirlo. After the yellow card, Liverpool decided to replace Boudewijn Zenden with Harry Kewell. Liverpool's best goalscoring chance of the match occurred minutes later. Gerrard capitalised on an error by Gattuso to be one-on-one with Dida, but his shot did not possess enough power to beat the Milan goalkeeper.\nLiverpool began to exert more pressure, although all their play was in front of the Milan penalty area, while Milan were unable to keep possession of the ball. In an attempt to bring about an equalising goal, Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez substituted Mascherano for striker Peter Crouch. Milan had an attack minutes later, but Inzaghi was unable to control the ball. Inzaghi made amends minutes later when he scored Milan's second goal. With Mascherano substituted, Kaká had the space to pick out a pass to Inzaghi, who took the ball to the side of the Liverpool goalkeeper Reina and rolled it into the net to make the score 2–0 to Milan. Liverpool managed to pull one goal back in the 88th minute when Kuyt scored with a header after Agger had flicked on Pennant's corner from the left. However, they were unable to find a second goal and the referee blew for full-time with the score 2–1 to Milan.\nPost-match.\nThe European Champion Clubs' Cup was presented to Milan captain Paolo Maldini in the Guest of Honour's box, as UEFA President Michel Platini favoured a return to the past tradition of the winning captain receiving the trophy among the fans. It had become customary in recent years to have the presentation on a hastily constructed podium in the centre of the pitch. This was the first time that the trophy was presented to a winning captain by a UEFA president who had actually played against him in the past; during Michel Platini's final seasons with Juventus, the then-teenager Paolo Maldini was making his professional debut with Milan.\nMilan manager Carlo Ancelotti was delighted with his team after their success. Ancelotti's job had been under threat after a run of poor results in December, therefore the victory had extra significance for Ancelotti: \"When I think back to December, we had to overcome so many hurdles so that makes it a very special victory.\" Milan midfielder Clarence Seedorf, who had his fourth victory in the competition following Milan's triumph was equally proud in the team's achievement: \"I am so proud to be part of this team. We worked hard this year, a very difficult year.\"\nA number of Milan players who had played in the 2005 final were delighted with the victory after they lost two years previous. Kaká claimed victory was all the sweeter as a result: \"What happened then was strange, just six minutes when we played not so good and we paid for that.\" Milan midfielder Gennaro Gattuso echoed his teammates sentiments: \"The defeat two years ago will stay me for a lifetime, but this is a different story. It's our turn to celebrate now.\" Striker Filippo Inzaghi, who missed the final in 2005, was delighted to have scored the goals that won the final for Milan: \"I've scored quite a few times in Europe, but scoring in the Champions League final is something special.\" Milan President and owner Silvio Berlusconi was equally delighted about the success, adding that \"the fortune we lacked in Istanbul we had with us tonight.\"\nLiverpool manager Rafael Benítez was disappointed that his team were unable to match their exploits of 2005, when they beat Milan in a penalty shootout. Despite this he was still proud of his players efforts: \"Thank you to our supporters, my staff and players who worked really hard and deserved a bit more.\" Benítez was already thinking of making transfers in the aftermath of the match, hinting that his team lacked the same calibre of players that Milan had: \"You could see the quality they had, and we need to start thinking how we can improve our team.\"\nLiverpool captain Steven Gerrard was adamant that despite the defeat Liverpool would come back stronger next season: \"We've got to pick ourselves up, have a good rest in the summer and then go again next season.\" Gerrard thought that although Liverpool controlled the first half, they did not control the match as much in the second half as they would have liked. Gerrard echoed his manager's sentiments in regards to new players joining the club: \"We need to strengthen and bring some quality into the club. The manager and the people in charge of the club know that and it will be an interesting summer.\"\nWinning the Champions League entitled Milan to compete in the 2007 UEFA Super Cup against UEFA Cup winners Sevilla. The match was overshadowed by the death of Sevilla player Antonio Puerta, which raised the possibility that the Super Cup might not go ahead. It did however, Milan beat Sevilla 3–1 to secure their fifth Super Cup victory. Milan's success also entitled them to compete in the 2007 FIFA Club World Cup. They entered the competition in the semi-finals, defeating Japanese team Urawa Red Diamonds 1–0 to progress to the final where they faced Argentine team Boca Juniors. Milan won the match 4–2 to secure their first FIFA Club World Cup triumph."

        "text": "The NCCA 3 Day Championship (previously the Minor Counties Cricket Championship) is a season-long competition in England and Wales that is contested by the members of the National Counties Cricket Association (NCCA), the so-called national counties (previously called the minor counties) that do not have first-class status.\nHistory.\nThe competition began in 1895, with the Worcestershire honorary secretary Paul Foley being influential in its creation. It has been contested annually ever since apart from the two World War periods, and cancellation in 2020 due to COVID-19. From 2014 to 2019 the tournament was known as the Unicorns Championship.\nFour clubs which used to play in the Minor Counties Championship have been granted first-class status – Worcestershire in 1899; Northamptonshire in 1905; Glamorgan in 1921 and Durham in 1992.\nUntil 1959, when the Second XI Championship was founded, most second XIs of the first-class counties used to contest the Minor Counties. A few continued to do so and the last to withdraw was Somerset 2nd XI after the 1987 season.\nSince 1983, the clubs have been split into an Eastern and a Western Division. The winners of the two divisions play each other in a match at the end of the season to determine which will be the Champions. Until 1983 all clubs competed in a single league. Teams played varying numbers of matches and did not play all other counties, so the table was ranked according to average points gained per match. The team with the highest average won the championship, except in a year when the top two counties had not played each other. In this case the second-placed team in the table had the right to challenge the leaders to a match to decide the championship. The second-placed team had to win this Challenge Match to take the title, with the league leaders being declared champions if they won or the game was drawn.\nAt present, there are twenty clubs involved. Nineteen represent English counties and the other is a Wales team that represents all the Welsh counties except Glamorgan. For details, see Minor counties of English cricket.\nList of Minor Counties/National Counties Champions.\nFinals summary.\nIn 1983, the then minor counties were divided into a Western Division and an Eastern Division, the winners of each division meeting in a final to decide the overall winner. From 1983 to 1993, the Championship was decided by a 55-over limited overs match. From 1994, the final was decided by a two-day, two-innings match with certain restrictions on the first innings, and from 1999 the final has been a three-day, two-innings match and only an outright result has decided the Championship."

        "title": "The Baseball Bunch",
        "text": "The Baseball Bunch is an American educational children's television series that originally aired in broadcast syndication from August 23, 1980 through the fall of 1985. Produced by Major League Baseball Productions, the series was a 30-minute baseball-themed program airing on Saturday mornings, which featured a combination of comedy sketches and Major League guest-stars, intended to provide instructional tips to Little League aged children.\nThroughout its five-season run, the series starred Johnny Bench, Tommy Lasorda and The Famous San Diego Chicken alongside a group of eight children (boys and girls ranging in age from 8–14) as \"The Bunch\".\nProduction.\nProduced by Major League Baseball Productions, and starring Cincinnati Reds catcher Johnny Bench, and Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda, the series was envisioned as a fun, but informative way for Little League aged children to learn the fundamentals of baseball. The original pilot for what would become \"The Baseball Bunch\" was filmed at Pepperdine University in Los Angeles in 1980, and did not originally include The San Diego Chicken (Ted Giannoulas). In a 2007 interview with JustMyShow.com, Giannoulas recounted how he became part of the series, saying \"The producers called me up and they said 'We want to shoot this again. We think it's a little dry for kids to be watching this. A lot of good baseball information, but not enough color to it, so can you come in and just improvise around what we've done, and we'll re-shoot the whole thing.' I did that, and suddenly they had magic in the can, and they sold the show.\" The pilot, starring Bench, Lasorda, and Major League guest-star Steve Garvey, aired as a \"special\" presentation on August 23, 1980 (with some stations airing it the next day instead).\nAs preparations for the first full season began, production for the series was moved to Tucson, Arizona to begin filming in February 1981. According to several cast-members, the location and time of year were selected for two main reasons; citing the ideal weather (70° temperatures in February), and Tucson's proximity to the Major League's spring training camps, which accommodated the Major League stars who could come in and film an episode during the month of February, then head directly over to their camps for spring training. Youngsters auditioned to be part of the original \"Bunch\" were selected from the Tucson, Arizona Little League as well as some brought in from talent agencies as far away as Phoenix, Arizona and Las Vegas, Nevada. The eight children ultimately chosen, boys and girls of varying ages and ethnicities, were selected for their \"boy/girl-next-door\" appeal, and to reflect the diversity of the intended audience, rather than for extraordinary athletic prowess or singing abilities (contrary to popular belief, the eight children who made up \"The Bunch\" did not sing the show's theme song). In his interview with JustMyShow.com, Giannoulas added, \"I think they kinda were looking for kids that didn't have that polished 'Hollywood' look to them, that seemed more real and (would) come across as free and easier that way.\"\nFilming each entire season within a three-week period during the month of February would become the standard production practice throughout the five season run of the series. Erik Lee (\"Rick\", seasons 1–4) recalled, \"Each 30-minute episode took basically a day, so we would start early in the morning and just go all day. [...] We would film for a couple weeks at a time and (while filming) we would get out of school for a couple weeks at a time. It was glorious.\" While the Tucson location was selected specifically to accommodate the Major League players just prior to spring training, segments featuring Lasorda (\"The Dugout Wizard\") were filmed without him. Linda Coslett (\"Kate\", season 1) recalled, \"We would pretend. We would look at this chalk-board that was blank, and then they would go back to Los Angeles and film it separately with Tommy and then plug him into the show. So Tommy Lasorda was never on the set.\", with Erik Lee adding, \"We never met (Lasorda), unfortunately.\" Departing from the traditional fall-through-spring television season, the first official season of \"The Baseball Bunch\" debuted in broadcast syndication on Saturday May 2, 1981, with new episodes airing throughout the summer months on Saturday mornings and/or early afternoons, usually either right before or right after the networks' line-ups of Saturday morning cartoons. Although airing in reruns year-round, the format of debuting each new season in the spring (April or May) and airing new episodes throughout the \"summer vacation\" season was used for all five seasons of the show's original run.\nPremise.\nThe series starred Johnny Bench as the coach to a fictional baseball team of eight little league aged children known as \"The Baseball Bunch\". The ninth team-member was \"The San Diego Chicken\" (played by Ted Giannoulas) who served as a comic foil to Bench as he would attempt to mentor the children. Each episode was divided into two segments. The first segment featured a current or former Major League player demonstrating a baseball fundamental to the children (e.g., learning to pitch within a hitters' strike zone) as well as the children's sometimes humorous attempts to imitate the star. The Major League guest-stars would also serve to steer the children clear of what \"not\" to do (e.g., explaining why a growing child should not attempt to throw a curve ball). The second segment featured a skit with \"The Dugout Wizard\" (played by Tommy Lasorda), a mystical turban wearing \"Swami\" character who taught a second baseball fundamental (e.g., how to catch a fly ball). This second instructional segment was often accompanied by a music video (a genre then in its embryonic stage), composed of clips of Major League players either performing the act or failing at it-for instance, the episode which featured knuckleballer Phil Niekro mentions how difficult a knuckleball can be to catch and showed several clips of frustrated catchers trying to do so. In addition to the technical fundamentals of the game, the series would also touch on some of the psychological challenges youngsters face, including addressing performance anxieties (an adolescent boy's fears of not being \"good enough\" before a big game) and sportsmanship (a \"little league father\" criticizing his son unmercifully from the sidelines gently being urged to relax and enjoy the game).\nThe Bunch.\nThroughout the show's five-season run, the series featured a rotating cast of eight children who starred as \"The Bunch\", usually ranging in age from eight to fourteen. As the youngsters entered adolescence and outgrew their roles, they would be replaced by younger children closer in age to the target audience. Linda Coslett (\"Kate\", season 1) said of her time on the series, \"I was eleven (when the show started). I turned twelve actually during the month of February, during the filming, and I was on (the show) for one year. [...] As you know, women get mature during those years and (by the second season) I didn't look like a little girl anymore, so they wanted to go with somebody that was younger looking.\" Erik Lee (\"Rick\", seasons 1–4) said of his run on the series, \"I was all of twelve years old when I started with \"The Baseball Bunch\". I stayed with The Bunch for four incredible years, until my voice changed and I was taller than Johnny Bench.\" With a rotating cast that included new children every season, only three youngsters appeared as \"Bunch\" team-members for all five seasons; Stacy Blythe (\"Michelle\"), Jared Holland (\"Sam\") and Danny Santa Cruz (\"Louie\", sometimes credited as \"Luis\"). The children who appeared as \"The Bunch\" team-members at one time or another during the show's five-season run are, in alphabetical order:\nGuest stars.\nWith the rare exception of the occasional \"Best Of\" episode (which were composed of clips of previous episodes), most every episode featured a well-known guest-star from the Major Leagues brought in to mentor the children in their particular field of expertise and included many future Hall of Famers. Some of the Major League guest-stars to appear on the series include, in alphabetical order:\nBroadcasting.\n\"The Baseball Bunch\" aired in broadcast syndication, with local stations carrying the original run of the series from the spring of 1981 through the fall of 1985. During this time, the series also aired nationally on the basic cable network WTBS and later, in reruns on ESPN.\nReception.\nDuring its run, \"The Baseball Bunch\" was well received by children and adults alike. Throughout its five years on the air, the series won multiple Emmy Awards for outstanding achievement in special programming, a gold medal from the International Film and Tape Festival in New York, and an award from Action for Children's Television, as well as receiving an endorsement from the National Education Association. In its time, the series also spawned a fan club, (known as \"The Baseball Bunch\" \"Fun Club\"), which young fans of the show could join for a fee of $4.99. Members received a \"membership certificate\", a \"Baseball Bunch\" T-shirt and wrist-bands, a full-size color poster of \"The Bunch\", and \"The Baseball Bunch\" \"Fun Book\", which included color photos and biographies of Bench, Lasorda and the kids, puzzles, sheet music and lyrics for the show's theme song, and a comic strip known as \"The Baseball Bunchies\".\nIn his March 1984 review of the series, \"The Miami Herald\" Head Sports Writer, Bob Rubin praised the show, writing \"\"'The Baseball Bunch'\" is a humorous, marvelously creative blend of entertainment and instruction. With the glut of dreck that passes for children's programming on the weekends, it's a breath of fresh air. And you don't have to be a kid or a baseball fan to enjoy it, either. [...] Serving as both participants and pupils is an eight-kid rainbow coalition that represents a typical neighborhood group. There are six boys and two girls, ranging in age from 9 to 14.\" Rubin also praised Giannoulas's contribution to the series, writing \"The Chicken may be the most gifted physical comic since Curly, Larry and Moe. [...] It's a laugh and a lesson, which is SOP (standard operating procedure) on \"'The Baseball Bunch'\"\".\nIn a March 2001 \"Sports Illustrated\" article about his younger days, writer Mark Bechtel looked back fondly on his childhood memories of the series writing, \"The first three letters of the word notwithstanding, there's very little fun in fundamentals. Still, the creators of \"Baseball Bunch\", a half-hour TV program that aired in the early 1980s, made learning the game's intricacies a joy. Each week, host Johnny Bench was joined on a sandlot in Anywhere, U.S.A., by one of his big league buddies and a group of preteens. Tommy Lasorda, in his Dugout Wizard get-up complete with absurd turban, competed for laughs with the San Diego Chicken. The result was sublime Saturday-morning fare, equal parts Tom Emanski and Barney. [...] The Bunch didn't make me a major leaguer, but it did make a lasting impression — and I can proudly say that in my days as a Little League catcher, no runner ever absconded with second.\"\nIn his 2007 interview with JustMyShow.com, Ted Giannoulas recalled Major League players also secretly enjoying the show, saying \"That was a real highlight being on that program [...] During the show's existence, I had professional baseball players tell me that they would sneak a peek at the show and pick up tips because the information that Johnny and our guests would put on the show was very very good inside baseball information. [...] So I took that as a real compliment because it signified how credible and good the advice that Johnny and the players were giving, and that not only were kids picking up good advice, but I can attest that professional ball-players were also tuned in as well.\"\nHome video.\nAfter the series' original run ended in the Fall of 1985, Scholastic-Lorimar, along with the show's long-time sponsor Kool-Aid, released three one-hour \"Best Of\" VHS tapes in April 1986. Each tape was dedicated to a particular aspect of the game; \"Pitching\", \"Hitting\" and \"Fielding\", and compiled segments of various episodes from all five seasons. Hosted by Johnny Bench and the only three children to appear on all five seasons of the series; Stacy Blythe as \"Michelle\", Jared Holland as \"Sam\" and Danny Santa Cruz as \"Louie\", the three tapes also included new \"Drill\" segments, in which Bench would recommend basic drills young viewer's could use to improve their game, while the three children (by that time, teens) demonstrated each exercise. As compilations of previous episodes, no segments of Lasorda as \"The Dugout Wizard\" were included on the videos, instead, the tapes focused exclusively on segments which had featured The Bunch with Major League guest-stars. The tapes also did not include the show's well-known \"The Baseball Bunch\" theme song, replacing the opening and closing theme with an alternate instrumental version of the music.\nRevival series.\nTelevision producer, Steve Church created, directed and produced a local, St Louis market version of \"The Baseball Bunch\" with the St. Louis Cardinals and then team President, Mark Lamping . Church felt a modern-day version of the series could work and, in 2002 Church launched production of \"The Cardinals Kids Club\", which still airs on Ballys Sports Midwest. Several years later Church went on to produce and directed an 8-minute pilot for a new national version of the series for ESPN. The unaired pilot was filmed in Williamsport, Pennsylvania and Los Angeles, California starred Harold Reynolds as the mentor and Philadelphia Phillies mascot The Phillie Phanatic, as well as cameo appearances by Jimmy Kimmel, J. K. Simmons, Roy Firestone, Scott Rolen, José Lima, Fernando Valenzuela and Bobcat Goldthwait. However, ESPN eventually \"shelved\" the project \nChurch began development on another \"Baseball Bunch\", this time under a production shingle CG Entertainment Partners with actor John Goodman, This re-boot still has an MLB star as host and Phillie Phanatic, alongside a new cast of kids.

Titles can be any combination of singles and doubles, so the combined total is the default sorting of the lists. The current top-level events are on the ATP Tour for men and the WTA Tour for women.\nOverall titles (Open Era).\n\"Note: M/W player with most mixed doubles titles in the table is also the player with most mixed doubles titles overall.\"\nSingles titles.\nMen.\nOpen Era title leaders composition\nSources: ATP; Michel Sutter, Vainqueurs Winners 1946–2003, Paris 2003; Joe McCauley, The History of Professional Tennis, London 2001; Robert Geist, Der Grösste Meister Die denkwürdige Karriere des australischen Tennisspielers Kenneth Robert Rosewall, Vienna 1999; Tony Trabert in \"Tennis de France\" magazine; ATP; John Barrett editor, World of Tennis Yearbooks, London 1969 to 1983.\nBefore 1972 tennis results were not automatically registered as they are now with the ITF (International Tennis Federation) and the ATP. Many have been lost or never even recorded. In particular, many professional results before 1968 have disappeared or are contradictory (for instance Ray Bowers, who gives a very detailed account of the 1926–1945 pro era called \"History of the Pro Tennis Wars\" in the \"Tennis Server\" Web site, categorically affirms that there was no 1936 Wembley Pro tournament (and no 1938 edition too) while McCauley lists a final result). However the most important ones have been preserved. ATP data is far from being exhaustive. They only begin in 1968 and they omit many results until 1971–1972 and even after. For example, there are no results of the New South Wales Championships in 1973 (Mal Anderson) or in 1974 (Tony Roche).\nTherefore, the global numbers listed here are at least equal if not superior to those of the ATP \"(even the modern players as Connors, Lendl, McEnroe, Nastase, Ashe or Borg have more titles here (for instance Borg won his first tournament at Helsinki in 1973 and it doesn't appear in the ATP statistics))\". Other remark: Michel Sutter chose about 150–200 tournaments each year including some invitation tournaments or tournaments which were at the time (before the nineties) the equivalent of the Challenger series tournaments of today. When those tournaments appeared in the early nineties Sutter listed them in his book. Sutter, being the main source of that part of the article, such tournaments are counted in this list \"(this explains for instance why Federer has four more wins than his ATP wins number)\"."

Having been held the previous year at the Heart of the Midlands Club in Nottingham, the event moved to Jollees Cabaret Club in Stoke-on-Trent where it was to remain until 1985.\nThe tournament was held between 2 February and 9 February and had been expanded from 16 players to 24. The eight seeded players each received a bye into the second round. The format also changed from a straight matchplay (legs) to sets. Each set was the best of 5 legs. - For matches in the opening rounds the matches were best of three sets, - best of five for the quarter-finals and semi-finals, with the final being best of 9 sets, split over an afternoon and evening session with the play-off for third held in between.\nDefending champion, Leighton Rees of Wales again progressed to the final where he met John Lowe in a repeat of the inaugural championship. This time, Lowe was the top seed and came out on top in the final by 5 sets to 0.\nNew players.\nWith the expansion from 16 to 24 players in the finals, 11 players made their championship debuts, the most notable being John Wilson of Scotland, - no doubt to be soon known as Jocky. Wilson's performances over 1978 had enabled him to be seeded 8th for the tournament, and thus ensure a place in round 2 straight away.\nSeeds.\nWilson entering the seeds meant he would replace Rab Smith, the Scot having to play the first round before moving into the later stages. England's John Lowe had risen to be number 1 seed, with Eric Bristow dropping to 2nd seed after his first round defeat a year earlier. Leighton Rees remained seeded 3, with Tony Brown moving up to number 4. The Semi-Finalist from 1978 Nicky Virachkul was seeded 5th with the other Last 4-man, Stefan Lord seeded 6th. Alan Evans was the 7th seed along with Wilson as 8th.\nTournament summary.\nThe second Embassy World Championship opened up with the first surprise, Doug McCarthy's 2–1 win over Charlie Ellix. - McCarthy would meet Lowe in the last 16 later on in the event. Jim McQuillian, following Paddy Clifford as only the second Irishman to pay in the World Championship, looked comfortable in his 2–0 win over Murray Smith.\nLeighton Rees, the defending champion, played a notably poorer standard than he did in the previous year's event. In all but one of his matches in this tournament, he averaged below 80, including in the final. John Lowe won the final in a set whitewash to achieve the first of his three world championships.\nPrize money.\nTotal Prize fund was £15,000 (plus a £12,000 bonus for a nine-dart finish - not won)\nResults.\nJohn Lowe won the final 5-0 (3-1, 3-0, 3-0, 3-2, 3-0) and thus became the 1979 BDO World Darts Champion. Illness prevented Alan Evans from playing the third-place match, so Tony Brown took third place by default."

        "title": "Cangrejeros de Santurce (baseball)",
        "text": "The Cangrejeros de Santurce (; \"Santurce Crabbers\") are a professional baseball team based in Santurce, the largest barrio of San Juan, Puerto Rico. The franchise joined the Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente when it was the semi-professional Liga de Béisbol Semi-Profesional de Puerto Rico. Having played for over 80 years, the Cangrejeros have won sixteen national titles and five Caribbean Series. With over 2000 victories, the Cangrejeros have won the most games in the history of Puerto Rican professional baseball. The 1954–55 Cangrejeros, nicknamed \"Panic Squad\", was the team's most notable roster, with a lineup that included hall of famers Roberto Clemente and Willie Mays. This version of the Cangrejeros won the National and Caribbean championships by sweeping their respective series.\nThe Cangrejeros most recently played its home games at Hiram Bithorn Stadium, in the municipality of San Juan. For several years they shared this field with the Senadores de San Juan (also known temporally as the San Juan Metros). A sports rivalry has always existed between both teams, leading to the creation of the \"City Championship\", which was a season-long series that gave the team with the most wins the aforementioned title. During the 2003–04 season they also shared the stadium with the Montreal Expos before they were relocated to Washington, D.C., and became the Nationals. Previous home fields include the Sixto Escobar Stadium near Old San Juan, as well as the Juan Ramón Loubriel Stadium in Bayamón. The team's official radio station in the metropolitan area was WIPR (AM), on the 940 AM frequency.\nCreation and early years.\nPedrín Zorilla, an amateur baseball player and then executive in Shell Oil's branch in Puerto Rico, established a baseball team at Santurce in the 1930s. A franchise was soon created and headquarters were located at Parada 20, Heriberto Ramírez de Arellano was responsible for its title, naming it after the Cangrejo Arriba and Cangrejo Abajo sectors of Condado and Loíza Street, where some players lived. Zorilla led a board composed of Ramírez de Arellano, Rafael Muñiz, Mike Pasarell, Héctor Nevares, Toño Palerm among others, which oversaw fund raising and operation. Panchicu Toste established contact with several local business, which promoted the team and managed ticket sales. The franchise received some opposition from the staff of the Senadores de San Juan, the municipality's main team at the time. The first uniforms of the Cangrejeros were bought blank, and the numbers and names of the players were sewed on for free by the mother of former general manager and sportswriter Carlos Pieve, who was a baseball fanatic. Following these efforts, the Cangrejeros joined the Liga de Béisbol Semi-Profesional de Puerto Rico for the 1939–40 season, one year after its foundation and sharing Estadio del Escambrón with the Senadores de San Juan. The team's lineup included Agustín Daviu, the first Puerto Rican to play organized baseball in the United States, and Luis Raúl Cabrera, both from Ponce. The rest of the local starters were Oscar Mangual, Ramón Concepción, Guillermo Angulo and Fellito Concepción. The league's rules allowed the inclusion of three foreign reinforcements, Zorilla contracted Negro leaguers Billy Byrd, Josh Gibson and Dick Seay to fill these spaces. Seay served as player-manager in the early part of this season, leaving the office to Gibson once he arrived until he abandoned the team to play in Venezuela before the season was over. The Cangrejeros made their debut on October 1, 1939, trading victories with Aguadilla in a doubleheader.\nAnother doubleheader was played against San Juan in October, with the teams trading victories again. The rivalry between the Cangrejeros and Senadores became known as the \"City Championship\", a term coined by Zorilla as a publicity stunt, with San Juan winning the first banner of this matchup. However, the team suffered a 23–0 loss to Guayama in November, which marked the worst defeat by any Santurce-based team in 60 years. Consequently, the Cangrejeros were called a \"soft ball team\" by the media, a pattern that continued throughout its early years. The Cangrejeros finished the season's first half in the sixth place, tying Aguadilla fourth during the second half. The team concluded its first season by defeating San Juan in two consecutive games, forcing the Senadores to play more games to secure the pennant. The team's home stadium was renamed Estadio Sixto Escobar after Sixto Escobar, Puerto Rico's first boxing champion. After an average first season, Cabrera soon became the Cangrejero's franchise player, conserving this status throughout the 1940s. In 1940–41, the Cangrejeros improved their performance. With the loss of Gibson, the team had signed Efraín Merced, Georgie Calderón, Raymond Brown and obtained Pedro Jaime Reyes in a trade for Concepción. The team had a weak start, trading victories in a double-header against San Juan before finishing last during the first half of the season, drastically improving to win the second half and earn a spot in the championship series. This was the first time that the Cangrejeros won the \"City Championship\" banner, winning all games against San Juan during the second half. The team finished this half with a record of 11 wins and 3 losses, gaining victories over the Grises de Humacao, Caguas, Mayaguez and Guayama. In the championship series, the Cangrejeros were matched against the Criollos de Caguas, losing in seven games. Cabrera won the LBSPR's Most Valuable Player Award. In 1941–42, the Cangrejeros lost several close games, being unable to match Ponce, the team that won both halves led by Francisco Coimbre. Gibson rejoined the team, hitting .480 to win the MVP award. The Marín Rum Company became the team's first sponsor, which earned the team a nickname, \"Santurce-Marín\" during the early 1940s.\nWorld War II and first Caribbean Series title.\nDuring the Second World War, several players were drafted into military service. The league cut the number of teams by half and no foreign reinforcements played for three years. In 1942–43, Caguas lost its franchise and Santurce signed some of its players, including Luis Olmo, Sammy Céspedes and Manolo García. The Cangrejeros won the first half and advanced to the finals, but lost the series to the Leones de Ponce. In this season, Olmo was named Co-MVP along Coimbre. Ponce went on to win the following two championships with the Cangrejeros finishing in the second place, Félix Andrade and Alfonso Gerard won Rookie of the Year awards for Santurce, while Tetelo Vargas won the league's batting title in 1943–44. In 1945–46, the team had its worst season up to that point, finishing last in the league. However, Víctor Cruz became the team's third straight Rookie of the Year. Gibson did not a hit a single home run throughout the season, experiencing an emotional breakdown that convinced Zorilla to send him back to Pittsburg. Vargas was the team's best hitter, while his former teammate in Guayama's amateur circuit, Perucho Cepeda, joined the Cangrejeros. In 1946–47, Santurce was managed by Clarence Palm, finishing fourth in the league's standing. Willard Brown joined the team during that season, winning the batting title. Guigo Otero took over the office of vice-president. The Cangrejeros finished in the third place in 1947–48, despite signing Satchel Paige and Rubén Gómez and Brown winning the league's triple-crown. The team tied Mayagüez for the first half's lead, but the Indios were declared winners due to the leading the individual series. In 1948–49, the LBPPR established a new format, where the top three teams from an 80-game season would advance to the playoffs. The Cangrejeros tied Ponce in the second place, eliminating them in the semifinals. However, they lost the finals series against Mayagüez. The team recorded the best assistance in the league with 4,337 followers per game for a total of 173,466. In 1949–50, the Cangrejeros once again tied with Ponce in the second position, being eliminated in the semifinals against the Indios. Brown won its second triple crown. The team was sponsored by TEK Deluxe Toothbrushes. For the 1950–51 season, Zorilla signed George Scales to manage the team and contracted new imports. The team won its first pennant after José \"Pepe\" Lucas hit a home run that became known as \"El Pepelucazo\". The Cangrejeros went on to win the \"City Championship\", subsequently defeating the Senadores in all of their semifinal games. The team defeated the Criollos in a seven-game series, winning Santurce's first LBPPR championship and advancing to the newly created Caribbean Series. In their first international competition, the Cangrejeros were reinforced with Olmo who had returned to Caguas, Roberto Vargas and José Santiago among others, winning the first Caribbean title for Puerto Rico. Olmo was selected the series' MVP.\nIn 1951–52, Santurce finished third, winning 16 and losing 4 to finish the regular season. In the semifinals they defeated Caguas in all of the semifinal games, losing the finals to San Juan. Gómez was selected the league's MVP. In 1952–53, the Cangrejeros employed Buster Clarkson as the player-manager. This season marked Roberto Clemente's debut in the league after being signed by Zorilla. The team advanced to the playoffs, where they eliminated the Leones in three games. The finals were against the Senadores, with Santurce winning its second championship in a six-game series. The Cangrejeros went on to win their second Caribbean Series title, with a final record of 5–1. In the 1953–54 season, the Cangrejeros finished last in the standing, but Clemente and Gómez recorded solid performances. The following season, Zorilla and Otero asked permission to the New York Giants and managed to secure a contract for MLB National League MVP Willie Mays, who played centerfield and went on to win the league's MVP and batting title. Other imports included Clarkson, Bob Thurman and George Crowe. After the first month of the season, the team was in the fourth place of the league's standing with a negative record, before winning straight games against the Senadores and Criollos. Despite this change, the team made two releases to contract three reinforcement players, but lost one due to an MLB rule that prohibited the participation of five players from the same team in the winter leagues. On this year's All-Star game, Clemente hit two home runs to give the North team, composed of players from Santurce and San Juan, a victory over the South team. On October 31, 1954, Gómez pitched the league's first shutout, he finished with a record of 13-4 and won the \"City Championship\" and Caribbean Series title for Santurce. After sweeping their series, the team did not sign any reinforcement prior to the Caribbean Series, being the first time that a team had done so. Five players were included in the event's All-Star lineup, Don Zimmer carried the MVP and the Cangrejeros received a special trophy for winning three Caribbean championships. This version of the \"Cangrejeros\" was nicknamed \"El Escuadrón del Pánico\" by local newspapers. The team was received by a multitude and they were invited to La Fortaleza. The Cangrejeros signed seven new players for the 1955–56 season, including Orlando Cepeda, José Pagán and Juan Pizarro. They led the league throughout the regular season, winning that phase's title and advanced to the playoffs. Cepeda hit his first home run on October 30, 1955, in a 16-inning loss against the Leones. Despite this success, the team struggled to attract fans, a problem that affected the league for some years with the emergence of television. The other team to advance to the final series was the Criollos, who went on to win after falling behind 1–2.\nIn 1956–57, Zorilla sold the team to Ramón Cuevas. Clemente was traded to Caguas along Pizarro and Ronnie Samford. Gómez was the team's only MLB pitcher during this season. Santurce went on to win the league's pennant, winning ten straight games to close the regular season. In the final series, the Cangrejeros lost to Mayaguez 1–4. In 1957–58, the team won its fourth consecutive pennant recovering from a slow first-half start. The team was forced to adjust its schedule to comply with the growing popularity of horse races, product of El Comandante hippodrome opening that year. Cepeda lead the league in RBIs and was tied with Victor Pellot in home runs. The Cangrejeros lost the final to Caguas, in a series where Clemente and Pizarro dominated their former teammates. In the 1958–59 season, Zorilla returned to serve as the team's general manager and the team stopped airing their games to deal with attendance issues. San Juan and Santurce competed for the pennant throughout the season, but the Senadores ultimately won it leaving the Cangrejeros in the second place. The team went on to defeat Mayagüez in a seven-game semifinal. The other team to advance was Caguas, who gained a quick two-game lead in the final series. The Cangrejeros recovered, winning four straight games, being led by Gómez, Cepeda and Julio Navarro. Pellot, Nino Escalera and Luis Arroyo reinforced the Cangrejeros for the Caribbean series. The team finished in the third place with a .500 win percentage.\nEmergence of Cepeda; Gómez's latter career.\nThe 1959–60 season marked the end of a business deal with the San Francisco Giants that resulted in the participation of that team's prospects for Santurce, when Ray Murray was fired from the manager office after shifting Cepeda to the left field and recording a losing record. Olmo became the team's new manager and the team recovered Pizarro in a trade with Caguas. The \"Asociación de Jugadores de Puerto Rico\" (lit. \"Puerto Rico Players Association\") was formed, with Gómez and Santiago representing the Cangrejeros. Santurce advanced to the semifinals, where they defeated Caguas twice before losing the remaining three games. The Cangrejeros finished last during the first half of the 1960–61 season and were the runner-up of the second, but this result eliminated them under a short-lived league format where only the winners of one the halves advanced to the finals. During the 1961–62 season, the team shared its home stadium, Estadio Sixto Escobar, with the Senadores, eventually moving to Hiram Bithorn Stadium. The Cangrejeros advanced to the playoffs, defeating Caguas in a seven-game semifinal. Santurce won the finals series sweeping the Indios.

In 1986–87, the team developed a three-year professional agreement with the Dodgers, which provided them with several prospects and staff members, including manager Kevin Kennedy. Despite this, the team finished fifth during the regular season and did not advance to the Round Robin. The Cangrejeros won the 1987–88 pennant. Alomar, Sierra and DeJesús were joined by the returning Willard, Mike Hartley, Orlando Sánchez, Bill Krueger and Mike Pérez.

Thon retired after limited participation.\nIn 1995–96, the LBPPR suspended the Round Robin and returned to its former format.

The team went on to win the Caribbean Series that were held in Santo Domingo undefeated. This was the Cangrejeros' fifth Caribbean championship and the only title that a team from Puerto Rico won during that decade. In 2004, after a big decline in attendance in recent years, the Cangrejeros were sold to José Valentín, who decided to move the team to Manatí, with the approval of the mayor of San Juan, causing controversy among fans of the Cangrejeros. In response, the mayor changed the name of the Senadores de San Juan to Cangrejeros de Santurce for the 2004–05 season. However, the following season, the new Cangrejeros moved and the team changed its name to the Lobos de Arecibo, leaving the capital city without a baseball team for the first time in the league's history.\nIn May 2008, it was announced that the team would resume play for the 2008–09 season, and that the Atenienses de Manatí would be moved back to Santurce, and again become the Cangrejeros. As part of the Liga de Béisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico's restructuration program, Major League Baseball offered to work with its publicity. On July 15, 2008, personnel from the league and Major League Baseball participated in a reunion, where details about the league's merchandising were discussed. The team was still owned by Valentín. Participating in the now-renamed Puerto Rico Baseball League, the Santurce made the playoffs in their first season back after a four-year absence, but were eliminated in the first round. In November 2009, a dispense suggested by Valentín was accepted by the league's board of directors, and the team recessed for the following season. This was due to the franchise's difficulty to secure a home stadium due to the opposition of San Juan's municipal government. In August 2010, the league announced the return of the Cangrejeros, as well as the Senadores, to Hiram Bithorn Stadium. However, the following month, the municipality of San Juan once again opposed the participation of the two teams in the venue. League officials immediately held a reunion with municipal government personnel, pursuing a solution. They were not listed on the 2010-11 LBPPR schedule.\nReturn of the Franchise and Back to Success (2012–Present).\nThanks to the claim of the Santurce fans and in preparation for the 75th anniversary celebration, the Professional Baseball League reactivated the franchise for the 2012–2013 season.\nAs of the 2014–15 season, the team plays in the Puerto Rican league (now renamed the (LBPRC) They won the 2014-2015 championship under the management of Eduardo Perez. They once again crowned champions on the 2015–2016 season under the management of Ramon Vazquez, who also led the team to another championship on the 2018–2019 season beating the Mayaguez Indios. Vasquez resigned as a manager right after winning the title due to discomforts with hardcore Cangrejeros fans. Due to his prompt resignation right after winning the title, the team designated Carmelo Martinez as interim manager who led the team during the 2019 Caribbean Series in Panama.\nFor the 2019–2020, Santurce announced the hiring of José Valentín who was a former player for this franchise and former champion as a player in the 1999–2000 season. Valentin led Cangrejeros to the best record (21-10) during the regular season and faced again the Mayaguez Indios in the finals. Santurce won the series (4-1) earning the 16th title for the franchise on its 80th anniversary. Since rejoining the league, Cangrejeros has won 4 titles, including straight titles twice, the only \"back-to-back\" wins in franchise history."

        "text": "Adrian Howard \"Odie\" Smith (born October 5, 1936) is an American former professional basketball player.\nEarly life.\nSmith was the fifth of six children of Oury and Ruth Smith of Farmington, Kentucky. The family lived in a farmhouse that had no electricity and no indoor plumbing. He was nicknamed \"Odie\" after a comedian on the Grand Ole Opry. As a child, he attended a three-room schoolhouse in rural Graves County, Kentucky. Because the family didn't have money for a basketball, he learned to shoot one his mother made from rolling up his dad's socks.\nHe attended Farmington High School, where he nearly didn't play high school basketball until the school's principal and basketball coach agreed to give him a ride home, a distance of seven miles, after practices. As a senior, his only scholarship offer was from nearby Murray State University, but he took too long to accept and the offer was withdrawn.\nCollege career.\nSmith enrolled to play basketball at Northeast Mississippi Junior College (now known as Northeast Mississippi Community College). After Smith excelled on the court, Northeast coach Bonner Arnold convinced legendary University of Kentucky coach Adolph Rupp to send a scout to see Smith, and UK offered a scholarship.\nSmith didn't see much action his junior season until Kentucky's star guard, Vernon Hatton, went out with an appendectomy, and for seven games, Smith averaged 16.3 points. As a senior, Smith was a starter and averaged 12.4 points per game. The Wildcats' team, known as the \"Fiddlin' Five\", beat Seattle University 84–72 to win the 1957–58 national championship, led by 30 points from Hatton and 24 from Johnny Cox. Smith averaged just under 14 points in UK's four NCAA tourney wins, including seven in the championship game.\nSmith graduated from Kentucky with a business degree.\nAfter college.\nHe was selected in the 1958 NBA draft, but not until the 15th round (85th overall) by the Cincinnati Royals.\nUSAF All-Stars (1959–1960).\nInstead of attempting to make the Royals, Smith joined the U.S. Army, where he played on the Army's all-star team and in 1960 was selected to play on the eventual undefeated U.S. men's basketball team that won the gold medal in the 1960 Olympics in Rome, Italy. The team went 8–0 in the Olympics, led by future hall-of-famers Oscar Robertson, Jerry Lucas, and Jerry West, although in the opening win against host Italy, Smith was the team's leading scorer, with 17 points scored. The team's average margin of victory in the eight games was 42.4 points per game.\nAkron Goodyear Wingfoots (1961).\nSmith played for the Akron Goodyear Wingfoots in 1961.\nProfessional career.\nCincinnati Royals (1961–1969).\nSmith began his professional career in the 1961–62 NBA season.

Playing over 34 minutes per game, he averaged 15.1 points per game, with a .456 field goal percentage and .830 free throw percentage.\nThe 1965–66 season was both his most productive and noteworthy. He averaged a career-high 18.4 points and 3.6 rebounds per game as the Royals went 45–35 and, in the Eastern Division semifinals, extended the Boston Celtics to a fifth and deciding game before falling to the eventual NBA champions. On December 15 he scored a career-high 34 points against the Celtics, and followed that up on January 5 with another career-high of 35 points. During the season, Smith was selected to the 1966 NBA All-Star Game and, surprisingly for a game that including sixteen future Hall-of-Famers, Smith was named MVP after he scored 24 points in 26 minutes. It was his only All-Star appearance, and for winning the MVP award, he received a new Ford Galaxie car.\nIn his sixth NBA season, 1966–67, Smith averaged 16.6 points per game and led the NBA with a .903 free throw percentage and, for the fourth time, the durable Smith led the league in games played.

In 1970–71, his 10th NBA season, he played only 21 games, averaging 5.3 points per game in his final NBA season.\nVirginia Squires (1971–1972).\nSmith played for the American Basketball Association's Virginia Squires in 1971–72, averaging 5.1 points per game.

It was published beginning in 1995 by Slave Labor Graphics and was Watson's first monthly comic. \"Skeleton Key\" ran for 30 issues and a number of supplemental stories and was generally well received. The 30 issues were subsequently collected in five volumes.\nComic.\n\"Skeleton Key\" featured detailed black and white art. Its plot centered on two young women. The first protagonist is Tamsin, a high-school student living in Canada, who discovers the magical skeleton key that lends the series its title. This key can fit any door, and it \"unlocks\" pathways to other dimensions. While exploring these alternate worlds, she encounters the second protagonist, Kitsune, a Japanese fox spirit. The earlier volumes in the series deal primarily with the adventures of the pair in these alternate worlds, while in the later volumes, the fantasy elements become less prominent and the drama and romance of coming-of-age stories takes center stage.\nIn 2011 Watson returned to Skeleton Key with a series of short stories for Dark Horse Presents, an anthology title. These were collected in the \"Skeleton Key Color Special\", published as a one shot in 2012 from Dark Horse Comics.\nCartoon.\nAn animated series based on the comic book was ordered in 2001 by Nickelodeon. The animated series was to be produced by Sunbow Entertainment for an initial run of 13 episodes. However, the series never materialized."

British cultural critic and theorist Stuart Hall situates Bowling’s career within a first generation, or “wave” of post-war, Black-British art, one characterised by postwar politics and British decolonisation. He is the first black artist to be elected a member of the Royal Academy of Arts.\nIn 2019, Bowling was the subject of a hugely successful retrospective at Tate Britain and, in 2022, opened a major show of works that took place from 1966 to 1975 at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston. He is represented in more than fifty international collections, including the Museum of Modern Art (New York), the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York), Tate Britain (London) and the Royal Academy of Arts (London).\nBowling studied at the Regent Street Polytechnic, Chelsea School of Art and, later, the City and Guilds of London Art School. In 1959, he was awarded a scholarship at the Royal College of Art, where he joined fellow students David Hockney, R. B. Kitaj, Derek Boshier and Patrick Caulfield.\nEarly life and education.\nBowling was born on 26 February 1934 in Bartica, British Guiana, to Richard Bowling and his wife, Agatha.\nIn 1940, Bowling's father moved the family to New Amsterdam so as to take up his post as accountant and paymaster in the local police force. Bowling's mother was a highly skilled seamstress, dressmaker, and milliner; she created a successful business from scratch and built a grand three-storey clapperboard building with a boldly lettered fascia that proclaimed: \"Bowling's Variety Store\".\nIn May 1953, at the age of 19, Bowling emigrated to Britain, where he lived with an uncle in London and enrolled at Westminster College of Commerce to study English.\nAfter National Service in the Royal Air Force, Bowling met the future artist and architect Keith Critchlow. Influenced by Critchlow, Bowling went on to study art, despite earlier ambitions to be a poet and a writer. He lodged at his parents' house in Redcliffe Gardens, Chelsea, where he was painted by Critchlow, and he studied at the Chelsea School of Art.\nIn 1959, Bowling won a scholarship to London's Royal College of Art, where fellow students included artists such as David Hockney, Derek Boshier, Allen Jones, R. B. Kitaj and Peter Phillips. At the beginning of his studies there, Bowling concentrated on painting –still-life compositions of bottles, animals, meat and figure drawings. His Sheep’s Head paintings, made in the autumn of 1960, were a series of muddy, murky intense works reminiscent of Giorgio Morandi and his muted colour palette. Another series of paintings produced in 1960, titled the Athletes, are characterised by vivid chromatic colour and dynamically asymmetrical compositions.\nBowling graduated from the Royal College of Art in 1962.\nCareer.\nFigurative paintings and Pop Art (1950s and 1960s).\nBowling’s artistic career began with his first commercial exhibition, \"Image in Revolt\", at the Grabowski Gallery in Chelsea, London, in October 1962.\nIn autumn 1963, Bowling had begun to teach painting at Camberwell School of Art in London. There, with the assistance of the textiles department, he amassed a stockpile of canvas pieces bearing the image of his mother’s emporium screen-printed in red or green. The first painting in which the image was deployed was \"Cover Girl\" (1966). The title refers to the young woman with the Mary Quant-style dress and the Vidal Sassoon helmet haircut, an image appropriated from the cover of an \"Observer\" colour supplement of March 1966. \nThe masterpiece of the first phase of Frank Bowling’s career is \"Mirror\" (1964–66), the culmination of years of development in London. In this painting, Bowling appears twice: at the top of a spiral staircase from the Royal College of Art’s painting school, and at the foot of the stairwell, a metaphor for transition and emergence. In between is the figure of Paddy Kitchen.\n\"Map paintings\" (1967–1971).\nFrom around 1967 to 1971, shortly after arriving in New York, Bowling made a group of works now known as the map paintings. For Bowling, the map motif served both as evocative subject matter and as device to organize the flat, modernist picture plane. Bowling elected to present three of these epically proportioned canvases – \"Marcia H Travels\" (1970), \"Texas Louise\" (1971), and \"Australia to\" \"Africa\" (1971) – together with two marginally smaller works, \"Polish Rebecca\" (1971) and \"Traveling with Robert Hughes\" (1969-70), in his first solo museum exhibition, held at the Whitney Museum of American Art from 4 November to 6 December 1971.\n\"Poured paintings\" (1974–1978).\nIn 1974, Bowling constructed a movable wood platform, pivoted like a seesaw, so that paint could be poured onto unstretched canvas pegged to the tilted surface. Known as the poured paintings, they were characterised by their upright, rectangular format, linearity of cascading poured paint and masked edges. The combination of chance and precise technique resulted in process-driven works that share affinities with a long lineage of abstract painting. The poured paintings were the subject of an exhibition at Tate Britain in 2012.\n1980s.\nBy the early 1980s, dense, encrusted and flowing paintings, often using a large amount of gel, were a significant aspect of Bowling’s painterly practice. A turning point arrived in the summer of 1984, when he arrived at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine for an artist-teacher residency. Quite quickly, he began to incorporate a broad range of objects into his paintings such as newsprint, plastic and foam. In 1986, Bowling exhibited a group of major new paintings at the Serpentine Gallery in London, curated by Ronald Alley, then Keeper of Modern Art at the Tate Gallery. Among the works on display was \"Wintergreens\" (1986), now in the Royal Academy’s collection. A year after the show at the Serpentine Gallery, a key work from the same year, \"Spreadout Ron Kitaj\" (1986), was acquired by Tate. Also in 1987, Bowling created \"Philoctete’s Bow\", a work characterised by complex, textured surfaces, essentially additive and collage-like (involving stitching, patching and gluing fragments to the surface).\nTowards the end of the 1980s, Bowling made his \"Great Thames\" series of paintings (1989), in homage to the great English landscape painters J. M. W. Turner and Thomas Gainsborough. This was also the period Bowling started making sculpture. Seven sculptures resulted. For the 1988 exhibition at the Royal West of England Academy (RWA) in Bristol, he made a further group of sculptures in galvanised steel.\n2000s to the present.\nIn 2009, Bowling produced a series of vertical and horizontal \"zippers\" paintings, including \"Epps\", \"Litchfield\" and \"Chinese Chance\" (all 2009), suggesting tall skies or long horizons. In 2011, Bowling presented new works known as the \"Crossings\" at ROLLO Contemporary Art in London. In these paintings, bands of colour are overloaded along the centre of the canvas creating a thickly textured build-up of contrasting colour. \"Crossing: Snakeheadpassage\" (2011) and \"Crossing: Liberty\" (2011) are two such examples.\nIn 2017, there was a retrospective of his work at Haus der Kunst in Munich. A major retrospective exhibition of his work was on view at Tate Britain in 2019. \"Land of Many Waters\", a major exhibition of unseen works by Bowling, alongside key paintings from the previous decade, was exhibited at the Arnolfini in Bristol in 2021. In 2022, the Stephen Lawrence Gallery at the University of Greenwich focused on his sculptures and the sculptural aspects of his paintings in an exhibition called \"Frank Bowling and sculpture\".\nThe exhibition \"Frank Bowling's Americas\" was at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston from 22 October 2022 to 9 April 2023 and will be at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) from 13 May to 10 September 2023.\nBowling's paintings have been shown in numerous exhibitions in continental Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States and are included in major private and corporate collections worldwide. His work can also be seen in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, as well as the Tate Gallery in London.\nArt criticism, curatorial work and teaching.\nFrom 1969 to 1972, Bowling was a critic and contributing editor at \"Arts Magazine\", where he rejected the idea that \"artists who happen to be black\" should be making overtly political or protest art, and defended those engaged in abstraction. His critical writings represent a significant contribution to intellectual debates on \"black art\". His writings have been included in several publications such as \"The Soul of a Nation Reader\" and \"Mappa Mundi\".\nIn 1969, Bowling organised an important exhibition at Stony Brook University, New York, titled \"5+1\", that included abstract works by five Black American artists – Melvin Edwards, Daniel LaRue Johnson, Al Loving, Jack Whitten, and William T. Williams – together with his own paintings. Bowling held teaching positions at many institutions, including at Camberwell School of Art, where he taught painting in 1963, and lectureships at the University of Reading (until 1967); Columbia University, New York (until 1969); Rutgers University, New Jersey (until 1970); and Massachusetts College of Art, Boston (1970–71).\nRole within the history of postwar British art.\nFrom the late 1960s onwards, Bowling’s work appeared in many of the century’s most important exhibitions that centred upon the work of Black-British and Afro-Caribbean artists. Historian and artist Eddie Chambers notes how Bowling took part in an important, though now largely forgotten, 1978 London exhibition entitled \"Afro-Caribbean Art\" alongside a variety of other major artists from Africa and its diasporic populations. Participants included Lubaina Himid, Donald Locke, Eugene Palmer, Mohamed Ahmed Abdalla and Keith Ashton.\nBowling was also featured in the highly influential 1989 exhibition \"The Other Story\", held in London’s South Bank Centre. The show sought to survey the history of postwar, Black-British art, serving as one of only two shows to ever tackle the subject matter. Curated by the London-based, Pakistani artist Rasheed Araeen, the landmark show sought to demonstrate the ways in which the history of contemporary non-Western art could be understood as both a variety of independent art-historical narratives as well as integral to a mainstream story of global art history. Araeen devised this curatorial approach as a protest against what he took to be a pervasive way of marginalising non-Western art histories in which artists working outside of the Western canon would be presented as existing within an insular, Western-adjacent canon. Participants included Rasheed Araeen, Salim Arif, Eddie Chambers, Aubrey Williams and Ronald Moody.\nFamily life.\nBowling married textile artist Rachel Scott in 2013.\nWhile working at the Royal College of Art, he met the novelist, biographer and art critic Paddy Kitchen when she was a member of staff there. They married in 1960 (divorcing in 1966) and had one son, who is now deceased: Richard Sheridan Bowling (1962–2001), who was known as Dan Bowling.\nFrank Bowling has two other sons: Ben Bowling (born 1962), Professor of Criminology &amp; Criminal Justice at King's College London, whose mother is the artist Claire Spencer; and Sacha Bowling (born 1964), a film maker and photographer, whose mother is Irene Delderfield Bowling (whom Bowling married in 1969).\nStyle and influences.\nOver the course of six decades, Bowling has relentlessly pursued a practice which boldly expands the possibilities and properties of paint. Ambitious in scale and scope, his dynamic engagement with the materiality of his chosen medium, and its evolution in the broad sweep of art history, has resulted in paintings of unparalleled originality and power.\nIn his earliest works, Bowling was influenced by the work of Rembrandt, Goya, Van Gogh and Francis Bacon. From 1962 onwards, Bowling began to think deeply about geometry as an architectonic principle in his paintings. His interest in this direction dated at least from his Royal College dissertation on Piet Mondrian. The diptych \"Big Bird\" (1964) and \"Mirror\" (1964–66) are major examples of the importance of geometry to his work.\nA notable change in Bowling’s style occurred in 1966, shortly after arriving in New York. Paintings from his first months in the city understandably spring from pop art influences that had characterised his art over the past years but, around 1969, Bowling worked with personal photographs, letters, and cutout stencils of continents, overlapping references to geography, memory, and history in canvases he stained and splattered with liquid sweeps of acrylic paint. At this point, he befriended pop artists Larry Rivers and Jasper Johns, who were instrumental in his development as a painter.\nIn 1984, Bowling spent a productive nine weeks as an artist-in-residence at Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in rural Maine, United States, where he was inspired by the green landscape of the surrounding countryside. Bowling’s paintings from the mid-1980s assimilated his memories of classical English landscape painting with the revelation at Skowhegan. It was at this point that Bowling began incorporating objects into his paintings, influenced by the painter Larry Poons.\nThe sculptures Bowling made for the 1988 Royal West of England Academy recall the work of a number of modernist sculptors, among them Bowling’s friend David Evison, Brian Wall, John Panting and William Turnbull.\nThe work Bowling has made since 2010 is in many ways a summation of his earlier concerns. And yet one development in Bowling’s recent paintings is of special importance: the incorporation of found objects. Letters from friends and family, banknotes from British Guiana and France, cut-up bank cards, plastic animals, shirt collars, silk handkerchiefs, oyster shells, party poppers and medical equipment have all have become an increasingly significant element of his work, alluding to family connections and stories as well as international journeys.\nArt historians and critics have understood Bowling as a late proponent of modernism. This can easily be observed in his career-long engagement with abstract expressionism. However, Bowling more fundamentally maintains the famously modernist understanding of painting, and art-making more generally, as a profoundly intellectual act that, as Kobena Mercer notes, “demanded continuous reflection on the ideas, sources and materials of their work”. Stuart Hall notes how the African and diasporic artists of Bowling’s generation understood their appropriation of modernist abstraction, a European style, as a critical or postcolonial endeavour. He writes, “However ‘modern art’ was seen by them as an international creed, fully consistent with anti-colonialism which was regarded as intrinsic to a modern consciousness”. Rasheed Araeen, the Pakistani conceptual artist and famed curator of \"The Other Story\", calling modernism “the only way of dealing with the aspirations of our time”. This emphasis on modernist art as a means of reflective critique, though not necessarily political, is theorised by modernist critic Clement Greenberg, one of Bowling’s most important influences, in essays such as “Modernist Painting”.\nCritical assessment.\nBowling has been described as \"one of Britain’s greatest living abstract painters\", as \"one of the most distinguished black artists to emerge from post-war British art schools\" and as a \"modern master\". Writing for Art Basel, the art curator Sam Cornish said: \"Central to Bowling’s art is an astonishing aliveness to the mutability of color, as hue and material, combined with a flair for accumulating granular visual detail into dramatic, large-scale panoramas\".\nAwards, honours and recognition.\nBowling’s first award was a bursary from the Royal College of Art. He graduated in 1962 with a silver medal for painting. After graduating, Bowling was awarded a travelling scholarship, and travelled to Barbados, Trinidad and British Guiana (now Guyana). In 1967, Bowling was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, followed by a painting prize at Edinburgh Open 100, Scotland, for his painting, \"My Guyana\", 1966-67. In 1973, he received his second Guggenheim Fellowship and then, in 1977, a Arts Council of Great Britain Award.\nIn 2005, Bowling was elected a member of the Royal Academy of Arts. He was among about a dozen artists proposed to fill one of two vacancies in the 80-member academy, and is the first black artist to be elected a Royal Academician in the history of the institution. He was elected a Senior Royal Academician on 1 October 2011.\nBowling was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours. He was knighted in the 2020 Birthday Honours for services to art. He was awarded the 2022 Wolfgang Hahn Prize by the Gesellschaft für Moderne Kunst am Museum Ludwig.\nBibliography.\nPublic collections.\nBowling's works can be found in more than 50 international public institutions, including:"

        "title": "2001 BDO World Darts Championship",
        "text": "The 2001 BDO World Darts Championship was a professional darts tournament held from 6 to 14 January 2001 at the Lakeside Country Club in Frimley Green, Surrey. It was the 24th staging of the competition since the 1978 event and the 16th time it took place at the Lakeside Country Club. The tournament was the first of 44 British Darts Organisation (BDO) tournaments in 2001. The host broadcaster was the BBC and the competition was sponsored by the cigarette company Embassy.\nThe 2000 Winmau World Masters winner John Walton defeated the reigning world champion Ted Hankey 6–2 in the final, becoming the 15th BDO world champion. He joined Eric Bristow and Raymond van Barneveld as the third player to follow their success in the Winmau World Masters with the world championship. Walton defeated Ritchie Davies, Mervyn King, Marko Pusa and Wayne Mardle en route to the final. Steve Coote achieved a 167 checkout, the highest of the competition, in his first round match against Mardle. A women's world championship was held for the first time. It was won by Trina Gulliver, whitewashing Crissy Howat 2–0 in the semi-final and defeating Mandy Solomons 2–1 in the final.\nBackground.\nMen's competition.\nThe British Darts Organisation (BDO) was formed in 1973 by the managing director Olly Croft; the BDO World Darts Championship was first held in 1978. The 2001 tournament was held between 6 and 14 January in Frimley Green, Surrey and was the first of 44 BDO-sanctioned events that year. It was the 24th edition of the tournament and featured a 32-player main draw that was played at the Lakeside Country Club.\n27 players automatically qualified for the main draw with the top 8 seeded according to their final position in the BDO rankings. Mervyn King was seeded first overall and the tournament's reigning champion Ted Hankey was seeded seventh. The remaining five places were decided via a play-off round at the Lakeside Country Club on 30 November 2000. Steve Alker, Shaun Greatbatch, Jez Porter, Davy Richardson and Gary Robson were the five players who progressed from the qualifying rounds to the main draw. The maximum number of sets played in a match increased from five in the first and second rounds to nine in the quarter and semi-finals, leading up to the final which was played as best-of-11 frames. Sponsored by the cigarette brand Embassy, it had a total prize fund of £189,000 and the host broadcaster was the BBC.\nBookmakers considered the two-time champion Raymond van Barneveld the favourite to win the tournament. Hankey said he was optimistic he could win the tournament for a second time, \"I've kept my practising up and played in enough tournaments. I haven't let exhibitions take over.\"\nWomen's tournament.\nIn November 2000, the BDO announced the creation of an independent women's world championship tournament; it was established to celebrate the BDO's 30th anniversary of staging and promoting darts competitions. The tournament was staged between 6 and 11 January 2001, and allowed women players to avoid having to compete with men in the International Play-offs, which they had done since 1995. It featured the world's top three ranked players with one unseeded player and a total prize fund of £8,300. Trina Gulliver was seeded first overall, Francis Hoenselaar was the second seed and Crissy Howat was the final seeded player. The only non-seeded participant was Mandy Solomon. All matches were played to the best-of-three sets.\nMen's tournament.\nRound 1.\nThe first round of the competition, in which 32 players participated, took place from 6 to 8 January and was held to the best-of-five sets. In this round, King came from 2–0 behind Chris Mason to win three sets in a row and a 3–2 victory; Mason missed two consecutive game-winning opportunities on the double 18 ring in the fifth set. Afterwards, he said \"Lady Luck shone on me today.\" John Walton took the opening two sets against Ritchie Davies before his opponent won the third set. After Davies lost two legs in the fourth set, he won the third leg to return to contention; Walton won the match 3–1 in the fourth leg. Porter defeated fellow Englishman Richardson 3–2 in a closely contested match. Number five seed Co Stompé beat Andy Smith 3–1 to prevent a requite from Smith. On his debut appearance at the BDO World Darts Championship, Marko Pusa overcame the eighth seed Colin Monk 3–2. Pusa took the first two sets before Monk won the next two. Monk claimed the first two legs of the fifth set; Pusa forced a tie-break by taking the third and fourth legs. Pusa compiled two scores of 41 and one maximum score (180) to win the match on the double ten ring with his final dart throw.\nWayne Mardle, the winner of the 2000 Dutch Open, defeated Steve Coote, who achieved a checkout of 167, 3–2. In the first match of the second day, Martin Adams. the England captain, achieved three maximum scores to lead Erik Clarys 1–0. Clarys responded with the same scores in the second set. Adams then won the following two sets to claim a 3–1 victory. Two-time finalist Ronnie Baxter defeated world number 26 Mitchell Crooks 3–1. during which the two competitors averaged over 30 points per dart. Steve Beaton registered the tournament's first whitewash with a 3–0 victory over Bob Aldous. Van Barneveld won three successive legs in the first set of his match against Robson; he attempted a nine-dart finish in the second leg. Robson produced a 100 checkout to take the second set. A maximum score in the fifth leg of the third set gave Van Barneveld the lead, who took the match 3–1 in the fourth set.\nPeter Hinkley took a 3–1 win over Nick Gedney. The match between Hankey and debutant Greatbatch was interrupted by the first streaker in darts history. It caused a twenty-minute stoppage to allow security to remove her from the Lakeside Country Club. Hankey achieved six maximum scores and averaged 31.34 per dart thrown to whitewash Greatbatch 3–0. Both Hankey and Greatbatch spoke of their annoyance over the interruption after the match. Of the other four first round matches, all of them ended in 3–0 whitewashes. Sixth seed Kevin Painter produced three maximum checkouts to defeat Andy Jenkins, 1996 quarter-finalist Matt Clark beat qualifier Alker, and world number 22 Tony David lost to the third seed Andy Fordham, who had back pain. The final match saw Bob Taylor lose to Wayne Jones.\nRound 2.\nThe second round was held from 9 to 10 January. Mardle became the first player through to the quarter-finals when he took 24 minutes to whitewash Stompé 3–0. Walton took an early lead over King and averaged 32.95 per dart thrown. A checkout of 121 from King prevented Walton from winning four legs in a row; Walton won the second set 3–1. He took the first leg of the third set with a 148 checkout. Walton then completed a 3–0 whitewash of King with a checkout of 121. Pusa achieved an average of 33.77 points per dart thrown to defeat Porter 3–1. Baxter was the highest seeded player to enter the competition's next stage with a 3–1 victory over Adams.\nThe fifth match of the second round saw Van Barneveld win 3–2 over Beaton. It began with Beaton winning the first set and Van Barneveld responded to claim the second and third sets and lost one leg in the process. Beaton won three consecutive legs in the fourth set to level the score at 2–2, which Van Barneveld responded to claim a 3–2 victory over the former in the match's final set. Hankey achieved five maximum scores and whitewashed Hinkley 3–0. The result set-up a match with Van Barneveld in the quarter-finals. Painter achieved a 164 checkout and multiple maximums in defeating Clark 3–1 with a match-finishing dart on the bullseye ring. In the final match of the second round Fordham and Jones equalled each other's performance in the first set until Fordham took the set. Fordham compiled two maximum scores and won two sets in a row to whitewash a faltering Jones 3–0.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe four quarter-finals were played to the best-of-nine sets between 11 and 12 January. Walton won the first set of his match against Pusa and then missed the chance to attain a nine-dart finish on his penultimate throw in the second. He then took three consecutive sets and completed a 138 checkout before Pusa produced two maximum scores as he won two legs in a row. Pusa could not convert this form and Walton completed a 5–0 whitewash. Later that night, Mardle took an early lead of 3–1 over Baxter, who came back to level the score at 3–3. Baxter could not maintain this form and Mardle won two sets in a row with a 124 checkout completed on the bullseye to win 5–3. This ensured that one of the two players in the final would not be seeded.\nHankey overcame Van Barneveld 5–4 in a closely fought 1 hour, 40-minute match. The first two sets were won by Hankey by maintaining his composure and Van Barneveld levelled the score at 2–2. A fifth set whitewash returned Hankey to the lead; Van Barneveld twice levelled the score to 3–3 and then 4–4 to force a final set decider. Hankey took a 5–4 victory and progressed into the semi-finals with a 25 checkout after Van Barneveld was unable to convert a double. Against Painter, Fordham opened up a lead of 3–0. Painter reduced Fordham's advantage to one set ahead in the next two sets; he could not go any farther as Fordham took two consecutive sets to win 5–2 and was the final player to enter the semi-finals.\nSemi-finals.\nBoth of the semi-finals were played on 13 January. Walton overcame Mardle to win 5–3 and enter the final. He compiled finishes of 11 and 12 darts to claim the first set and Mardle took the second to level the score at 1–1. This prompted Walton to respond with victories in the following two sets to lead 3–1 at the mid-session interval. A second finish of 11 darts provided Walton with another set. Mardle then won the sixth and seventh sets to lower Walton's advantage to 4–3. Walton produced a 121 checkout and finished the match in the eighth set by throwing a dart on the double nine ring. Afterwards, Walton admitted to have calmed in the final set, \"I had to get off to a good start, having the arrows in the first set, and just told myself to keep winning my legs, and I managed to nick a few of his as well.\"\nThe other semi-final game saw Hankey enter the final of the tournament for the second year in a row with a 5–2 victory over Fordham. Hankey registered one maximum score en route to taking two consecutive sets and lead 3–1 before the mid-session interval. After the interval, Fordham drew to within one set with a finish of 11 darts. Hankey responded to win the match with victories in six of the next seven legs. Hankey reiterated afterwards that he sought to mirror Van Barneveld and Eric Bristow and win the tournament for the second time, \"It will mean everything to me to win again because I don't just want one or two Embassy titles, I want four or five.\" Fordham said Hankey pressured him from the commencement of the match, \"Ted played very well and although i didn't play badly it's very hard to stay in it when he's averaging over 33 for a dart.\"\nFinal.\nThe final played between Hankey and Walton on 14 January was held to the best-of-11 sets. The match began with Hankey achieving a score of 22 with the first three throws of his darts pack. Walton achieved a maximum score on his first try of the match, and he went on to secure the first two sets 3–2; the first of which he won with a Shanghai. The third set was won by Hankey by the same scoreline as both players produced two maximum scores. Walton won the fourth set by achieving two further maximum scores, a 100 checkout and a 12-dart finish. Hankey secured the fifth set to enter the five-minute mid-session interval 3–2 behind. After the interval, Walton won the sixth set. He followed up with victory in the seventh set by throwing 31 darts, and it coincided with Hankey's form declining. Walton and Hankey exchanged the first two legs of the eighth set before Walton achieved a 76 checkout in the third leg. Hankey missed a shot to secure a 121 checkout and Walton finished the match with a 25 checkout to win the tournament.\nWalton's victory made him the 15th player to win the competition; he had won the Winmau World Masters in December 2000. He became the first player since Bristow and Burnett to follow his success in the World Masters with the World Championship. Walton was awarded the championship trophy by Kate Hoey, the Minister for Sport, and earned £46,000 for winning the tournament. He said of his triumph, \"This means the world to me. It's an unbelievable feeling. When I hit the double eight I just wanted to fly. I'm absolutely delighted.\" Hankey praised his opponent's playing style, \"He was buzzing. I hit 180s all the time but I just couldn't get away from him. I knew I had to win the sets in which I threw first but he hits so many 140s and 180s.

I missed a couple of doubles but I've no complaints.\"\nWomen's tournament.\nIn the first semi-final match, Gulliver produced four maximum scores and an average score of 31.63 per dart to whitewash Howat 2–0. Howat did not win any legs; she achieved an average score of 27.28. Solomons defeated Hoensellar 2–1 in the second semi-final match. Hoensellar responded to Solomons winning the first leg by taking the second. Somlons took the third and fourth legs to win the first set. Hoensellar produced a maximum score, maintaining her form to claim set two and force a final set decider. Solomons achieved a 66 checkout to provide her with an early advantage before the final set was tied at 2–2. Hosensellar missed the double 16 ring; a 96 checkout from Solomons secured her a berth in the final.\nSolomons took the first set of the final with a score of 3–1. In the second set, Gulliver produced the game's first maximum score as Solomons won the set. The final set saw Gulliver hit the triple 14 and double 16 rings to move into a position of advantage. She compiled scores of 94, 100 and a maximum to lower the points she needed for victory to 127. Gulliver required six darts to claim the title and she converted four of them to win the match and the tournament.

John quickly discovered he had a knack for the game and played his first professional tournament in Ventura, California, the weekend after graduation in 1975.\nDarts success.\nJohn enjoyed much success during his playing days from 1975 through 1987, including his first North American Open singles title, where he defeated world #3 ranked player, Jocky Wilson in the semi-final and the #1 player in the world at that time, Eric Bristow in the final. In 1982 he competed in the 1982 World Darts Championship but was defeated by the English darts player Tony Brown in the first round. His national ranking in 1985 earned him a spot on the US World Cup team to compete in Brisbane, Australia. The US won the team gold medal at World Cup V, which saw them defeat the English team 9-0, before going on to defeat the Australian team to win the gold medal. The US team also brought home the Silver medal for their 2nd-place finish overall. 1985 brought John to the US#1 ranking and his first Bulls-Eye News magazine cover.\n1987 was when he first retired from the game due to personal reasons and John enjoyed his spare time playing tournament and league softball.\n1999 saw a resurgence of John's darting career after a 12-year absence, where he enjoyed many successes, including a second North American Open singles title (defeating US player Roger Carter), being part of the rare accomplishment of winning both Open Doubles events at the Las Vegas Open (with Chris White) in 2001, and a second Bulls-Eye News magazine cover.\n2002 brought on a second retirement from darts and his venture into tournament paintball.\n2006 has brought on another resurgence into darts. Enjoying more success at events such as the Wild West Shootout and the San Francisco Open with Open Cricket singles titles for both.\n2007 added some semi-final and finals, but the quest for the perfect dart showed in the finishes.\n2008 saw an Open Singles Champion for the San Diego Memorial Open.\n2009 was a quiet year and 2010 brought on some very severe health issues, which left 2011 for John to pretty much learn how to throw a dart all over again. With lots more ability to travel to compete at tournaments in 2012, John has seen big improvements in his game.\nJohn has moved to the east coast of the US and is now able to compete more often at the tournament level. John finished 2012 ranked in the top 30 in the US according to the national rankings for the American Darts Organization, and as of March 2013, is ranked at #6 in the national rankings.\nJohn began 2013 with a new sponsor, the Puma Darts Company out of New Zealand as a Shot! Ambassador.\nIn 2017, John has been living in Cary, North Carolina for two years and competing locally in leagues and different events. He is not currently sponsored and not traveling to tournaments at this time. He continues to be one of the top leaders in the leagues of the area in winning percentages and averages."

He came close to winning the world championship on a number of occasions, reaching the World Professional Darts Championships semi-finals four times, losing twice to Eric Bristow and twice to John Lowe.\nCareer.\nBrown appeared in the first-ever World Championship in 1978 as the number 8 seed, but surprisingly lost to Australian namesake Tim Brown. Brown then went on to reach the semi-finals of the World Championship for three successive years - 1979, 1980 and 1981.

He won the first two Darts World KO Cup tournaments held in Oldham – these were subsequently sponsored by Dry Blackthorn Cider from 1983 to 1989. He defeated Nicky Virachkul in the 1980 final. He also won the WDF Europe Cup Singles event in 1980. Brown reached the final of the prestigious Winmau World Masters in 1978, losing out to Welshman Ronnie Davies.\nBrown enjoyed team success with England – winning the WDF World Cup team event in 1979 and 1981 and the WDF World Cup pairs with Cliff Lazarenko in 1981. He also teamed up with Lowe and Bristow to enjoy Nations Cup triples success for England in 1979 and 1980. \nBrown was one of the players who helped form the players' association PDPA (Professional Dart Players Association) along with Lowe, Lazarenko and Dave Whitcombe. The association was set up with the intention of promoting more televised tournaments. Although Brown was not part of the darts scene in the 1990s (his last World Championship appearance was at the 1984 BDO World Darts Championship), the PDPA would be instrumental in the formation of the World Darts Council (now Professional Darts Corporation) and would split the game into two organisations.\nBrown moved back to his home town of Dover, and was back playing in the local league, the Dover Invitation Darts League."

        "text": "Senegal competed in the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia. The country's participation at the Games marked its Winter Olympics debut, although it had competed in the Summer Olympics since 1964. The delegation consisted of a single alpine skier, Lamine Guèye, who did not win any medals. This was the first time a black African competed at the Winter Olympics, and Guèye would later return to the Winter Games twice more in 1992 and 1994.\nBackground.\nSenegal first competed in the Summer Olympics at the 1964 Games in Tokyo, Japan. They participated on five occasions prior to the 1984 Winter Olympics, where they made their Winter Games debut in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia. They sent a single alpine skier, Lamine Guèye. Several other countries made their Winter Olympic debut in 1984; Puerto Rico, Monaco, the United States Virgin Islands and fellow African nation Egypt.\nGuèye had arranged for the creation of the Senegalese Ski Federation in 1979, and had initially expected to be unable to compete at the 1984 Olympics due to the qualification requirements and as he was recovering from an injury, but was informed by the International Olympic Committee several months prior that he would be allowed to represent Senegal. Guèye was the first black African to compete at the Winter Games; South Africa became the first African nation to compete at a Winter Games, in 1960, but with an all-white team under apartheid.\nAlpine skiing.\nThe sole Senegalese athlete at the Games, Lamine Guèye, competed in the men's downhill and giant slalom. He compared arriving at the athletes village to being a \"kid in Disneyland\", and said that he was welcomed by everyone at the Games. He entered the stadium during the Parade of Nations in the opening ceremony as the Senegalese flag bearer sandwiched between the United States and the Soviet Union, the two largest delegations.\nIn the downhill, Guèye finished his run with a time of 1:59.64, in 45th place. He registered times of 1:42.63 and 1:46.04 in the giant slalom, finishing in 57th place. He later said that \"We have no word for downhill in Senegalese because we have no mountains. I was so afraid I almost threw up. I have fully tested the safety measures and can tell you that they work.\"\nFollowing the Games, Guèye felt that his Olympic career was over and did not compete at the 1988 Winter Games. He was inspired watching the Jamaican bobsled team on television, and returned to the Winter Olympics for both the 1992 and Games. He later became a spokesman against the qualification standards imposed on the Games, with his book \"Skieur Senegalais Cherche Esprit Olympique\" (\"Senegalese Skier Seeks Olympic Spirit\")."

        "text": "Senegal competed at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. The country returned after missing the 1988 games and marked the second time it had competed at a Winter Olympics. This was the first time the country has entered more than a single athlete, with skiers Lamine Guèye and Alphonse Gomis both taking part. The lack of support staff meant that Guèye sought medical assistance from another team. Neither competitors won a medal, and Gomis was noted by the media for the number of falls he had on the slopes.\nBackground.\nSenegal made their Winter Olympic debut at the 1984 Winter Games in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia. This followed a campaign by alpine skier Lamine Guèye, who as a teenager, had also founded the country's ski federation. At those Games, Guèye had become the first black African to compete at the Winter Olympics. Following the Sarajevo Games, Guèye retired temporarily from competing professionally and instead took up employment as a model and an actor, in addition to earning a living in the finance sector.\nUpon viewing the performance of the Jamaican bobsleigh team at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Guèye decided to return to the Olympics once again. He maintained that he had a hard time explaining the sport to his fellow countrymen, saying \"I have to tell the people what snow is, what skis are, I have to tell them what big mountains are. They don't have any reference on these things.\" Joining Guèye at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, and becoming the second Senegalese athlete to compete at a Winter Games, was ski instructor Alphonse Gomis, who resides in Tignes, near Albertville. As at the 1984 Winter Games, Guèye was Senegal's flagbearer during the Parade of Nations in the opening ceremony. No support staff were sent with the skiers, so that when Guèye injured his back, a doctor from the American team treated him.\nCompetitors.\nThe following is the list of number of competitors in the Games.\nAlpine skiing.\nBoth the members of the Senegalese team at the 1992 Winter Olympics, Lamine Guèye and Alphonse Gomis, took part in the same skiing events; the men's downhill, super-G, giant slalom, slalom and the combined competition.\nThe first event to take place was the downhill, on 9 February. This consisted of a single run each; Guèye finished in last position with a time of 2:12.84, over 22 seconds behind Patrick Ortlieb of Austria who took the gold medal. Gomis was one of nine skiers who failed to complete their run, the first of several incomplete runs by the ski instructor during the course of the Games. This would later be referred to by \"The Washington Post\" as a \"world-class agony-of-defeat spill\". His performances were referenced by \"The Record\" as \"Gomis was the one you may have seen on the highlights, doing unplanned cartwheels, nosedives, and slides down the hill\".\nOver the next two days, the combined event took place. Neither skier from Senegal finished their runs. The Super-G competition took place on 16 February, with an improved standing for Guèye, who finished 78th out of the 93 skiers who completed the course with a time of 1:29.18. Gomis did not finish.\nThe giant slalom was next, on 18 February, and was the only event in which both skiers completed the course. Guèye recorded a time of 2:44.98 in 66th place, while Gomis completed the run in 74th place with a time of 2:48.08. Both were some distance behind the winner, Alberto Tomba of Italy who had a time of 2:06.98. The duo's final event was the slalom, on 22 February. Both were among the 52 skiers who failed to complete their runs in the competition.\nThe 1992 Winter Olympics were the last Winter Games to be run before the introduction of more strenuous qualification standards. This meant that at the 1994 Winter Olympics, Senegal was unable to field a second skier, and Guèye would be limited to competing in a single event."

This was the Netherlands Antilles' second and final appearance at a Winter Olympic Games before the territory was abolished. The delegation consisted of two competitors; Bart Carpentier Alting and Dudley den Dulk; who came 37th in the two-man bobsleigh.\nBackground.\nThe Nederlands Antilliaans Olympisch Comité was recognized by the International Olympic Committee on 1 January 1950. The Netherlands Antilles joined Olympic competition soon after, at the 1952 Summer Olympics. The territory made only two appearances at the Winter Olympic Games, in 1988 at Calgary, and these 1992 Albertville Games. The Netherlands Antilles was dissolved as a political entity in October 2010. The 1992 Winter Olympics were held from 8–23 February 1992, a total of 1,801 athletes representing 64 National Olympic Committees took part. The Netherlands Antilles sent two athletes to Albertville, in the bobsleigh competition, Bart Carpentier Alting and Dudley den Dulk. Den Dulk was selected as the flagbearer for the opening ceremony.\nCompetitors.\nThe following is the list of number of competitors in the Games.\nBobsleigh.\nBart Carpentier Alting was 37 years old at the time of the Albertville Olympics, and had previously represented the Netherlands Antilles four years prior in Calgary.

The Netherlands Antillean sled finished the first run in 1 minute and 2.97 seconds, and the second run in 1 minute and 3.26 seconds. Overnight, they were tied for 36th place. The next day, they finished the third run in 1 minute and 3.40 seconds, and the fourth in 1 minute and 3.46 seconds.

        "text": "Bandon Dunes Golf Resort is a complex of five links and a par-3 golf course on the West Coast of the United States, located alongside the Pacific Ocean in southwest Oregon, just north of the city of Bandon.\nCourses.\nThe first course at the resort, Bandon Dunes, opened on May 19, 1999. Bandon Dunes was designed by Scotsman David McLay Kidd, and it instantly garnered high praise. The course was one of Kidd's early efforts at designing a golf course. Since opening, the original golf course on the property has been adjusted. Alterations include significant amounts of gorse removal and a rerouting of the par-3, second hole. Bandon Dunes is traditionally home to resort guests' lowest scores, thanks to its forgiving landing areas off the tee and mildly to moderately undulating green complexes.\nThe resort's second course, Pacific Dunes, opened on July 1, 2001. Pacific Dunes was designed by Michigan architect Tom Doak, and sculpted by his design firm, Renaissance Design, Inc. Pacific Dunes also opened to glowing reviews and quickly surpassed Bandon Dunes as the highest-rated course on the property. Pacific Dunes was rated the number one resort golf course in the country in 2005 by \"Golfweek\" magazine, placing just ahead of Pebble Beach. It was ranked 8th in the best links courses ranking by Golf Magazine in 2014.\nThe resort's third course, Bandon Trails, was designed by the team of Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw. Bandon Trails opened on June 1, 2005. Bandon Trails differs from its siblings in that no holes are routed along the Pacific Ocean. The course meanders through dunes, meadows, and forest land. Upon its opening, \"Golf Odyssey\", the preeminent newsletter devoted to golf travel, named Bandon Dunes, \"The Best Place on the Planet for Golf\".\nThe fourth course, Old Macdonald (in honor of Charles Blair Macdonald), was designed by a team led by Tom Doak and Jim Urbina. It opened in June 2010.\nThe fifth course, Bandon Preserve, is a Par-3 short course There are 13 holes on the course. It was also designed by Coore and Crenshaw, and the course opened on May 1, 2012.\nA more recent addition to the Bandon Dunes family, The Punchbowl, is a putting course designed by Doak and Urbina. It opened in 2014 and is adjacent to the first tee at Pacific Dunes. It has 18 holes and takes about an hour to play. The area is a collection of natural hollows. Punchbowl is a longstanding design concept by golf architects. The 18th hole at Old Macdonald shares the same principles and is aptly named \"Punchbowl.\"\nThe sixth and newest course, Sheep Ranch, opened on June 1, 2020. Located to the north of Old Macdonald, it has a mile of ocean frontage over a series of promontories, with several holes featuring shots over water and cliffs. The property had been a wind farm in the 1970s, but had been abandoned because the winds proved to be too intense for turbines of that era. Resort owner Mike Keiser bought the land in 2000 along with business partner Phil Friedmann, and originally intended for it to be a private course separate from the main resort. Doak and Urbina started work on the property after completing Pacific Dunes, and had completed 13 greens before Keiser and Friedmann stopped construction once locals heard about the project, fearing that the project would cause problems for the resort. For more than 15 years, the property sat largely vacant; the greens were not irrigated, and only a select number of resort guests who asked the right individuals were allowed on the incomplete course. Eventually, Keiser and Friedmann decided to incorporate this land into the resort, and enlisted Coore and Crenshaw to design a full course. Three pairs of holes that travel in different directions share teeing areas.\nThe use of golf carts is not permitted at the resort, unless required for medical reasons.\nIn 2009, \"Golf Magazine\" named the three courses existing at that time to its list of the 50 best courses built in the last 50 years. Pacific Dunes ranked second, Bandon Dunes twelfth, and Bandon Trails thirty-third. In 2013, Golf Digest ranked Bandon Dunes (Old MacDonald) fifth in its list of the Top 50 Golf Courses for Women.\nThe resort is widely known as a top destination for golf trips.\nTournaments held.\nThe United States Golf Association has staged eight amateur championship tournaments at Bandon Dunes Golf Resort, the most recent being the 2022 U.S. Junior Amateur.\nThe USGA first came to Bandon Dunes in 2006, staging the Curtis Cup, a biennial women's amateur team competition between the United States and Great Britain/Ireland. The matches took place on the Pacific Dunes course, and the U.S. won 11½ to 6½.\nThe next year, 2007, saw the resort host the U.S. Mid-Amateur Golf Championship. Bandon Dunes was the primary course for the event, with Bandon Trails used as the second course for the stroke-play portion of the event.\nBandon Dunes hosted the 2011 U.S. Amateur Public Links and the U.S. Women's Amateur Public Links championship tournaments. It was the first time the USGA held the men's and women's Public Links events jointly. The tournaments were played on the Old Macdonald and Bandon Trails courses.\nIn 2015, the resort hosted the first-ever U.S. Women's Amateur Four-Ball, an event the USGA created to replace the Public Links, which was discontinued. The event was held on the Pacific Dunes course.\nBandon Dunes was also the site of the 2019 U.S. Amateur Four-Ball.

        "text": "Kenya sent a delegation to compete at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, United States from 8–24 February 2002. The delegation consisted of one cross-country skier, Philip Boit, who was appearing in his second Olympics, and was, at the time, Kenya's only Winter Olympian in history. His best performance was 65th place in the men's sprint.\nBackground.\nThe National Olympic Committee of Kenya was recognised by the International Olympic Committee on 1 January 1955. They have competed at most Summer Olympic Games since and have won a significant number of medals at Summer Olympiads. However, their first Winter Olympics participation only came in the 1998 Winter Olympics, and Kenya was making its second Winter Olympic appearance in Salt Lake City. The Kenyan delegation to Utah consisted of one cross-country skier, Philip Boit. He had also been the nation's only representative four years prior. As his country's only participant, Boit was selected as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony.\nCross-country skiing.\nPhilip Boit was 30 years old at the time of the Salt Lake City Olympics. Boit was a runner who had been scouted by American sportswear company Nike, who wished to train runners as cross-country skiers. After being recruited, Boit, who had never previously seen snow, initially trained in Kenya on roller skis. He then participated in the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. In the men's 2 × 10 kilometre pursuit held on 14 February, he finished the 10 kilometre classical portion in 36 minutes and 21.6 seconds. This ranked him 77th for the event, and only the top 60 were allowed to proceed to the second 10 kilometre freestyle portion. On 19 February, Boit participated in the sprint, finishing the qualifying round in a time of 3 minutes and 51.49 seconds and in 65th place. Only the top 16 finishers advanced to the quarterfinals, meaning Boit was eliminated. Boit would once again be the only Kenyan athlete at the 2006 Winter Olympics.\nSprint\nPursuit\n1 "

        "text": "Kenya competed in the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. The country's participation at the Games marked its Winter Olympics debut, although it had competed in the Summer Olympics since 1956. The delegation consisted of a single cross-country skier, Philip Boit. He had been trained as part of a scheme created by American sportswear company Nike, Inc. Although Boit did not win a medal, his efforts received worldwide attention after gold medallist Bjørn Dæhlie of Norway waited for him at the finish line as Boit completed the race in difficult conditions in last place.\nBackground.\nKenya first competed in the Summer Olympics at the 1956 Games in Melbourne, Australia. They participated at the Summer Olympics on nine occasions prior to the 1998 Winter Olympics, where they made their Winter Olympics debut in Nagano, Japan. They sent a single cross-country skier, Philip Boit.\nBoth Boit and Henry Bitok were runners who had been scouted by American sportswear company Nike, Inc., who wished to train a runners as cross-country skiers. After being recruited, Boit, who had never previously seen snow, initially trained in Kenya on roller skis.\nThey then travelled to Finland to practice on snow. Boit later explained, \"It was a bit challenging at first because I had never experienced cold weather like that in my life, even putting on skis was so difficult! But after some time, I learned to adapt.\" The response to Nike's project was mixed, with some comparing the story to the story of the Jamaican bobsleigh team at the 1988 Winter Games, while others such as Bob Wojnowski of \"The Detroit News\" said \"These are marketing pawns financed by well-heeled publicity seekers.\"\nThe sponsorship of Boit and Bitok consisted of $200,000, to cover their training, accommodation and equipment while in Finland. The logic had been that since Nike sent Finnish runners were sent to Kenya to train, then the same could be done in reverse. Following their training, both athletes tried to qualify for the Winter Olympics, but failed to do so. Instead, Kenya opted to use a single automatic qualification spot to send Boit to the Games in 1998. Shortly prior to the Games, Boit missed two weeks of training when he was hospitalised with a stomach problem.\nCross-country skiing.\nThe sole Kenyan athlete at the Games, Philip Boit, competed in the men's 10 kilometre classical cross-country skiing. The competition took place on 12 February, at the Snow Harp venue in Hakuba, Nagano. The beginning of the race was chaotic, with the skiers beset by heavy rain. Boit was not prepared to race on wet snow, and later attributed it as the reason for falling down on several occasions. He found that it added further complications, adding \"Going uphill, the skis were collecting snow. It was like I had put on high heeled-shoes!\"\nThe favourite for the race, Bjørn Dæhlie of Norway won the gold medal, but instead of going to the podium to collect it, he was informed that Boit was still racing – the only competitor left on the course, down in 92nd place. Dæhlie waited for Boit to finish, welcoming him as he passed the finish line. Boit was amazed by the crowd's reaction as he arrived, \"They were shouting 'Kenya GO!, Philip GO!' It was like I was winning a medal even though I was last.\" As he crossed the line some 20 minutes after Dæhlie, the Norwegian hugged the Kenyan – while Boit later said that he immediately thanked Dæhlie, the gold medallist insisted that Boit instead remarked that he would beat him at the next Olympics. The incident received worldwide attention.\nBoit's time was 47 minutes and 25.25 seconds. After the race, he explained to the international media, \"My goal, my aim, is to become a world or Olympic champion. I'm dreaming about becoming the first African to do it. I will do it.\" Dæhlie meanwhile said of Boit, \"He deserves to be encouraged. It was hard for him but he never gave up.\" Boit became a celebrity in Kenya following his return, and would continue as a professional skier until 2011, taking part in two further Winter Olympics, and continuing to be friends with Dæhlie. Shortly after the 1998 Games, Boit's first child was born, the Kenyan naming him Daehlie Boit."

The season consisted of 16 races. Nigel Mansell was the national champion as well as the Rookie of the Year. The 1993 Indianapolis 500 was sanctioned by USAC, but counted towards the CART points championship. Emerson Fittipaldi won the Indy 500, his second career victory in that event.\nThe biggest story going into the season involved Newman/Haas Racing. Nigel Mansell, the reigning Formula One World Champion switched from Formula One to the CART IndyCar Series. Mansell joined Newman/Haas Racing as teammate to Mario Andretti, taking the seat formerly held by Michael Andretti, who departed for one year to McLaren. Mansell came to the American open wheel series with considerable fanfare and huge media attention. He won the season-opener at Surfers Paradise, the first CART \"rookie\" to win his first start. At Phoenix, Mansell crashed during practice and was forced to sit out the race due to a back injury. At Indianapolis, he was leading the race with 16 laps to go when he was passed on a restart by Emerson Fittipaldi and Arie Luyendyk, and wound up third. He still won the Indy 500 Rookie of the Year award. Despite having missed the race at Phoenix, Mansell won five races (four of which were on ovals) en route to the CART championship. His team Newman/Haas Racing would still manage to win the one oval race Mansell missed with Mario Andretti scoring his 52nd and final victory of his IndyCar career at Phoenix, Andretti would finish 6th in the final championship standings.\nAfter winning his third CART championship in 1992, Bobby Rahal entered the 1993 season driving the R/H chassis (formerly the Truesports chassis). He finished second at Long Beach, but struggled to get his car up to speed, and failed to qualify at Indianapolis. He would run the remainder of the season with a 1993 Lola chassis, but with no victories. He did however finish 4th in points.\nSeason Summary.\nSchedule.\n Oval/Speedway&lt;br&gt;\n Road/Street course&lt;br&gt;\nDriver Breakdown.\n Rookie\nNotes.\nWith his title victory, Nigel Mansell became the first driver to win the CART Series in his rookie season.

It was in many ways a bridge between two eras of the game and, in a summer comparable for hot and dry weather to 1887, 1911, 1976 or 1995, saw W.G. Grace for the second of three successive years establish a record run aggregate, late-blooming slow bowler James Southerton become the first bowler to take 200 first-class wickets in a season and the first use of the heavy roller at Lord's. Although the heavy roller had been patented several decades earlier, its use was never seriously considered by MCC management despite many protests over the danger posed by the Lord's pitch where extremely frequent “shooters” alternated with balls that “flew” over the batsman's head. These dangerous pitches were viewed as a symbol of virility by many amateur batsmen, however; though when remembering one of W.G.’s finest innings – 66 on one of the roughest Lord’s pitches against a very strong Yorkshire attack against Yorkshire – fast bowlers Freeman and Emmett wondered how the champion was not maimed or killed outright.\nAn unfortunate accident to George Summers which led to his death from head injuries four days after being hit by a sharply rising ball from John Platts that had struck a loose pebble showed that in its first year the heavy roller had not radically altered the Lord’s pitch; though it was to do so from the following season\nA number of thrilling finishes occurred, most famously the University Match where a hat-trick by Frank Cobden gave Cambridge the match when Oxford looked certain to win.\nNotes.\nCambridgeshire, though still regarded in 1870 as first-class, played no inter-county matches"

His NHL debut came on April 18, 2006, versus the Pittsburgh Penguins, which was the Leafs' last game of the season. He scored his first NHL goal on his first NHL shot in a 5-3 victory. The Leafs failed to qualify for the playoffs, and he was sent down to the Marlies.\nHe was recalled to the Leafs on February 23, 2007, and played against the Montreal Canadiens. During this game, Mats Sundin shot the puck at Montreal goaltender David Aebischer and the rebound came straight to Williams, who scored his second NHL goal in a 5-4 loss. Williams was called up on February 27, 2008, and scored that night against the Florida Panthers.\nIn the following 2008–09 season, on December 8, 2008, Williams scored on a pass from Jason Blake and also recorded his first NHL assist in his career against the New York Islanders in a 4 - 2 win on his first game of the season with the Toronto Maple Leafs. In all 4 of his seasons with the Toronto Maple Leafs in which he had been recalled from the minors, he has scored in his first NHL game of the season. On February 9, 2009, he was placed on waivers and was sent back to the Toronto Marlies of the AHL after clearing waivers.\nOn July 7, 2009, as an unrestricted free agent, Williams signed a one-year, two-way deal with the Detroit Red Wings along with Toronto Marlies teammate Kris Newbury. On July 12, 2010, Williams again being an unrestricted free agent, signed with the New York Rangers.\nWith his NHL career at an impasse, on June 15, 2011, Williams signed a one-year contract with European team, EC Red Bull Salzburg of the Austrian Hockey League.\nOn April 16, 2013, Williams signed a one-year contract with Swedish team, VIK Västerås HK. He was the leading goal scorer of the Swedish second-division HockeyAllsvenskan during the 2013–14 season.

The Chiefs had very poor teams in Marshall's first five seasons, and the most passes he caught in that time frame was just 28, and that was in his rookie season. and when Marv Levy took over the team in 1978, he installed a running offense, limiting Marshall's offensive contributions.\nHe had a breakout year in 1980 when the Chiefs returned to a pro-style offense. Marshall hauled in 47 receptions for 799 yards and 6 touchdowns and was one of the team's premier receivers through 1986. His best season was 1984 as he totaled 912 yards on 62 catches.

He was signed by the San Francisco Giants as an amateur free agent before the 1958 season. He played for the Cleveland Indians (1966–1968) and Seattle Pilots (1969). He also played one season in Japan for the Nishitetsu Lions (1971). During a four-year major league baseball career, Vidal hit .164 with three home runs and 10 runs batted in (RBI) in 88 career games.\nVidal was a very good minor league hitter, but a poor fielder. He led his league three times in errors by an outfielder (1959, 1965 and 1966). Playing for the Hobbs Pirates of the Sophomore League in 1960, he hit .342 with 17 home runs and 81 RBI from just 93 games. In 1963, Vidal won the California League Triple Crown while playing for the Single-A Reno Silver Sox. He had a batting average of .340 with 40 home runs and 162 RBI in 139 games and was named the league's Most Valuable Player. He was called up to the Indians in September 1966 after hitting .293 with 15 home runs and 57 RBI in 115 games for the Triple-A Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League.\nHe made his major league debut as a pinch hitter on September 5, 1966, against the Boston Red Sox at Cleveland Stadium. Batting for pitcher Tom Kelley in the bottom of the sixth inning against Lee Stange, he flew out to right fielder Tony Conigliaro. The Tribe lost that game, the first of a doubleheader, 5–1, but won the nightcap by a score of 3–1. His first major league hit came 12 days later, in his first appearance in the starting lineup, with a two-run triple against Mickey Lolich at Tiger Stadium.\nDuring his four stints in the big leagues, Vidal never got on track at the plate, with successive averages of .188, .118, .167 and .192. He made 53 appearances in the outfield, 35 of which were starts, and, ironically, was charged with just one error in 65 total chances. On May 19, 1969, Vidal was traded by the Seattle Pilots to the New York Yankees, and never again appeared in a big league game.\nVidal's career highlights included hitting a walk-off home run off of Jack Fisher in a game against the Chicago White Sox in the bottom of the 14th inning on June 3, 1968."

Since then, the only Summer Olympic Games they have missed is the 1904 Summer Olympics. Denmark then first competed at the Winter Olympics at the 1948 Winter Olympics. Innsbruck was accordingly their fourth time participating in the Winter Olympics. The 1964 Winter Olympics were held from 29 January to 9 February 1964. The Danish delegation consisted of two athletes, cross-country skier Svend Carlsen and speed skater Kurt Stille. Carlsen was the flag bearer for the opening ceremony.\nCross-country skiing.\nSvend Carlsen was 25 years old at the time of the Innsbruck Olympics, and was making his Olympic debut. Carlsen competed in two races, the 15 kilometer and the 30 kilometer, both of which were won by Eero Mäntyranta of Finland. On 30 January, he took part in the 30 kilometers race, finishing in 1 hour, 46 minutes and 35.9 seconds, which put him 53rd out of 66 who finished the race; the gold medal was won in 1 hour, 30 minutes and 50.7 seconds by Mäntyranta. The 15 kilometers race was held on 2 February. Carlsen completed the race in 1 hour and 20.7 seconds, which put him in 57th place out of 69 classified finishers. The gold medal was again won by Mäntyranta, this time in a time of 50 minutes and 54.1 seconds. Carlsen would return to compete in the same two races four years later, representing Denmark at the 1968 Winter Olympics.\nSpeed skating.\nKurt Stille was 29 years old at the time of the Innsbruck Olympics, and was making his second Olympic appearance. He had previously represented Denmark at the 1960 Winter Olympics, skating the same three races in Squaw Valley he would skate here in Innsbruck. First for Stille was the men's 5000 meters, held on 5 February. He finished the race in a time of 7 minutes and 56.1 seconds, which put him 12th out of 42 competitors. Knut Johannesen of Norway won the gold medal in a time of 7 minutes and 38.4 seconds. The next day the men's 1500 meters was held, Stille finished in a time of 2 minutes and 17.4 seconds, which put him in 30th place; the gold medal was taken by Ants Antson of the Soviet Union in 2 minutes and 10.3 seconds. On 7 February, the men's 10,000 meters was held, and Stille had his best performance of the Games. He completed the race in 16 minutes and 38.3 seconds, which was sufficient for him to rank 9th out of 33 classified finishers. The gold medal was won in 15 minutes and 50.1 seconds by Jonny Nilsson of Sweden. Nonetheless, Stille's finish was Denmark's best at the Winter Olympics until their silver medal in women's curling at the 1998 Games."

The compulsory figures counted 30% of the final ranking, the short program 20%, and the free skate 50% of a competitor's final total factored placements. On 17 February, Dresler came in 14th place in the compulsory figures, out of 28 competitors. The next day, he ranked 12th in the short program, and on 20 February, he placed 15th in the free skate. Using the weighting formula, he recorded a total factored placement of 28.2, which ranked him 14th overall. The gold medal was won with a total factored placement of 3.0 by Brian Boitano of the United States, the silver was won by Brian Orser of Canada, and the bronze medal was earned by Viktor Petrenko of the Soviet Union."

He was an outfielder over parts of nine seasons with the New York Giants, Chicago Cubs, and Pittsburgh Pirates.\nRobertson was born in Portsmouth, Virginia. He attended North Carolina State University after matriculating at Maury High School and Norfolk Academy.\nIn 1916 and 1917, he tied for the National League lead in home runs (with Cy Williams and Gavvy Cravath, respectively) while playing for New York. The short-distanced right field fence at the Polo Grounds was a frequent target of long drives hit by Robertson and his Giants' teammate, Benny Kauff. Their hits to right field became so much of an issue that National League officials convened following the 1916 baseball season. Baseball officials decided to amend Rule #1, which read \"the shortest distance from a fence or stand on fair territory to the home base should be 235 feet.\" The amendment to the rule changed the shortest distance from a stand or fence to 270 feet.\nRobertson played for the Giants in the 1917 World Series against the Chicago White Sox, his 11 hits leading the team in the Series in a losing cause. A member of the Giants during the 1922 season, he did not make an appearance in the 1922 World Series. The champion Giants swept all four games of that Series from their crosstown rival New York Yankees.\nIn a nine-year major-league career, Robertson posted a .287 batting average (812-2830) with 366 runs, 47 home runs and 364 RBI in 804 games played. His on-base percentage was .318 and slugging percentage was .409. He surpassed the .300 batting mark three times. On September 14, 1920, he went 5-5 as a member of the Cubs. On August 19, 1921, he had 8 RBI in a game as a member of the Pirates. Eleven days later, on August 30, he hit for the cycle.\nRobertson died at the age of 81 in Virginia Beach, Virginia.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"

The tournaments are viewed as the precursor to the European Rugby Champions Cup, in which Toulouse were crowned the winners of the first edition in 1996.\nHistory.\nJean Fabre, newly elected President of Toulouse rugby club, conceived the idea of an international rugby union club tournament to help pay for the costs to complete improvements in their new stadium, Stade des Sept Deniers, following their move in 1978 from Stade des Ponts Jumeaux.\nFabre was influenced by the FIRA European Champions Cup (1962-1967) and by a mini-tournament that was organised by AS Béziers in 1978. The Trophee International Cadenat (Cadenat International Trophy), named after the co-founder of AS Béziers, , was an international expansion to the 1970s domestic competition (Jules Cadenat Challenge). In this 1978 international version, three teams from Coventry R.F.C. (from England), Petrarca Rugby (from Italy), and Glamorgan (from Wales) were invited to participate. Béziers defeated Glamorgan 31-8 in the final.\nThe French Rugby Federation (FFR) did not support clubs hosting mini tournaments, which meant any costs incurred hosting unofficial rugby events would be borne by the organising clubs alone. Fabre attained some support from businesses such as Matra Espace (as the main sponsor), La cinq (who screened matches), Aérospatiale, and UTA. The FFR soon relented in their refusal to be involved and provided minimal assistance in the hosting of the tournament.\nFabre hoped the tournament would be the creation of a European Club Cup competition, which would include four British and Irish teams (one club each from England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales), two teams from FIRA (Now Rugby Europe) and two teams from France, however, the British and Irish clubs declined their invitation. Fabre discarded the European Club Cup competition idea and turned to the southern hemisphere. He invited Ponsonby (from New Zealand) and West Brisbane (from Australia) and while both clubs initially gave assurances of their participation, they soon sent notice of their withdrawal from the tournament due to financial constraints on travelling. Fabre agreed to cover both clubs travelling expenses on condition they participated. Both clubs agreed, however, this decision by Fabre heavily impacted the finances of Toulouse. Banco Nación (from Argentina) and the Fiji Barbarians, who were touring South America and Europe, filled the remaining positions left vacant by the British and Irish clubs declining their invitations. Farul Constanta (from Romania) and L'Aquila (from Italy) (who replaced the Italian champions Petrarca Rugby after they declined their invitation) made up the FIRA invitees and Agen was the other French team that participated. \nThe 1986 tournament was a great success and Fabre sought to revitalise his idea of creating a European Club Cup competition, with the inclusion of British and Irish clubs, this time to mark the centenary of Toulouse rugby club. Pierre Villepreux who had coached the Toulouse team in their 1986 Matra Masters victory was handed the responsibility of organising the 1990 tournament. Bath (from England) were the only British club to accept their invitation. However, their main stars did not arrive for the tournament and Villepreux was not impressed that Bath did not order these players to attend, despite this being before the professional era in rugby union and where players required employment to support themselves and their families. Rumours began to materialise that Toulouse were offering cash incentives to each of their players that participated in a game where they were victorious. More problems appeared when the invitations to other French clubs and to the selected FIRA clubs were declined, however, both Wellington (from New Zealand), and Queensland (from Australia) agreed to participate, on the same conditions Ponsonby and West Brisbane had in the previous tournament, that Toulouse cover the travelling expenses. The final places were made up by national teams that include a Fiji XV (as part of their tour of Hong Kong and France), Romania XV, Soviet Union XV, and Western Samoa XV. \nFabre left his position as president of Stade Tolousain just before the commencement of his second masters tournament in 1990. It was not revealed until 1993 that both masters tournaments left a heavy dent on the clubs finances. While the tournaments seemed on the outside to be a success, inside the club, due in part to Toulouse officials travelling to the southern hemisphere clubs, covering travelling expenses of the southern hemisphere clubs while in France and unforeseen expenses related to television broadcasts, left the club on the verge of bankruptcy. Future plans for further editions of the competition were subsequently shelved.\nLater Rugby Masters.\nTwo further rugby masters stand alone matches were played in later years that were not organised by Toulouse. In the first of these games, the format which was similar to Rugby League's World Club Challenge pitted the winner of the Heineken Cup in Europe against the winner of Super Rugby in the Southern Hemisphere for the right to claim best in the World. The match between the champions of the 1996–97 Heineken Cup, Brive (from France) and the champions of the 1997 Super 12, the Auckland Blues (from New Zealand) ended in a 47-11 demolition win for the New Zealand team. The second masters match brought together the champions of the 2014–15 European Rugby Champions Cup, Toulon (from France) against the eleventh best team in the 2015 Super Rugby season, the Natal Sharks (from South Africa) and ended in a narrow 12-10 win for the South Africans.\n1986 Matra Masters.\nThe participating teams consisted of Toulouse as hosts and champions of the 1985–86 French Rugby Union Championship, Agen, finalists in the 1985–86 French Rugby Union Championship, L'Aquila, runners up in the , Farul Constanta champions of the 1985/86 Romanian Championship, Banco Nación co-champions of the 1986 Buenos Aires Championship, West Brisbane champions of the 1985 Queensland Premiership, Ponsonby champions of the 1986 Auckland Championship, and the on tour Fiji Barbarians.\nFarul Constanta upset the apple cart by defeating Ponsonby in their quarter-final. The result shocked not just the hosts, who feared a loss of revenue as a consequence, but also Ponsonby's captain Andy Haden who departed France on the first plane available embarrassed and angry with his team mates. The other quarter-finals went according to script with Toulouse, West Brisbane, and Agen defeating Banco Nación, L'Aquila, and the Fiji Barbarians respectively. \nIn the semi-finals, Farul Constanta were again rewriting the script by defeating Agen, however, the game is noted for its brutality which resulted in multiple Farul Constanta players missing the final through injury. The other semi-final was a one-sided affair with Toulouse easily defeating West Brisbane. However, West Brisbane would regain some honour when they defeated Agen in the Bronze final. In the final, Toulouse swept away an injured ridden Farul Constanta to claim the first edition of the Toulouse Masters. \n1990 Centenary Masters.\nThe competition split the teams up into two groups. The first group, Europe, consisted of Toulouse, Semi-finalists in the 1989–90 French Championship, Bath, winners of the 1989–90 Pilkington Cup, and two national teams from Romania and the Soviet Union. The second group, the Southern Hemisphere, consisted of Queensland, a provincial union in Australia, Wellington, 1989 and 1990 New Zealand provincial champions, and two national teams from Fiji and Western Samoa. This splitting of the groups based on geography occurred to avoid a similar scenario as the previous tournament in 1986 when the southern hemisphere teams were knocked out early from the tournament. The winner of the Europe section would play the winner of the Oceania section. \nA repeat shock did occur in the quarter-finals with the Fiji XV easily defeating Wellington from New Zealand. The other quarter-finals went according to script with Toulouse, Bath, and Queensland progressing to the Semi-finals following their respective defeat of Romania XV, Soviet Union XV, and Western Samoa XV. Both semi-finals were generally one-sided affairs. In the game between Toulouse and Bath, the visitors were phased by the rapturous celebrations of the home fans who beat drums and blew trumpets and hooters, creating a deafening environment. Bonneval, Cazalbou (with two) and Soula scored four unanswered tries for Toulouse, with Marfaing picking up the extras with a conversion and a penalty. Tim Reeman kicked two penalties for the consolation scores for understrength Bath team. While in the other semi-final, Queensland easily defeated Fiji XV, thereby preventing another shock. However, Fiji XV would regain some honour in the Bronze final when they scored twelve tries to Baths three tries. The Fijians' speed and agility left the inexperienced Bath players feeling utterly dejected. In the final Toulouse were comfortable winners over Queensland to claim for the second time the Toulouse Masters crown."

Fitch, who was the Commercial Attache for the American embassy in Kingston from 1985–86, suggested that Jamaica should begin competing in the Winter Olympics and is quoted as saying, \"You got great athletes and a great athlete should be able to do any sport.\" After seeing a local pushcart derby, Fitch and businessman William Maloney proposed the idea of a Jamaican bobsleigh team, as it played well to the strengths of Jamaicans in sprinting. The President of the Jamaica Olympic Association at the time supported the idea, and so preparations were made to hire athletes. Advertisements were placed describing \"dangerous and rigorous\" trials which would form the basis of the country's first bobsleigh team. However, recruitment proved to be problematic, so the Jamaica Defence Force was asked for volunteers. This resulted in the first team of Dudley Stokes, Devon Harris, and Michael White. These three were selected as part of the team in October 1987, with teammate Caswell Allen added later.\nWith funding provided by Fitch and the Jamaica Tourist Board, training was conducted in Canada and Austria in preparation for the 1988 Winter Olympics. Sepp Haidacher was recruited as a coach, and the team began to be featured in North American media with a comical angle. An agreement was reached with the Fédération Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing in order to allow for entrance in both the four-man and the two-man events at the Games. Once in Calgary, the team conducted test runs on a frozen lake in order to get used to the conditions, but Allen fell and was injured. Chris Stokes, who was only in Canada in order to support his brother Dudley, was added to the four-man team three days before the first run having never been in a bobsleigh before.\nThe first event which Jamaica competed in was the two-man bobsleigh, where Dudley Stokes and Michael White became Jamaica's first Winter Olympians. In their first run, they finished in 34th position, ahead of the second New Zealand team, both of the pairs from Portugal, U.S. Virgin Islands and Mexico. They improved in the second run, moving up to 22nd place, but were in 31st place on the third run and finished only one place higher in 30th place during the fourth and final run. Overall the duo finished in 30th place out of the 41 teams competing.\nFollowing the elimination of the United States ice hockey team, American television stations needed to fill airtime and chose to focus on the Jamaican bobsleigh team in the four-man event. The first run ended poorly, as when Dudley Stokes jumped into the bobsleigh, the push-bar in the sleigh broke, resulting in the team coming in third from last in 24th place. On their second attempt, the team ranked second to last, due in part to White struggling to crouch down properly in his seat, remaining almost upright through the first corner.\nIt was the events of the third run for which the team became best known. Stokes injured his shoulder prior to the race, but decided to continue with the run. The team set the seventh-fastest start for all competitors. At the turn called the \"Kreisel\", Stokes lost control of the bobsleigh and it careened into the wall of the track, and flipped over on top of the four athletes. The four team members climbed out and the bobsleigh was pushed to the end of the track by support staff while the team walked alongside it. The team did not compete in the fourth run of the event, and subsequently were listed as not finishing the event and therefore were placed in the last place overall.\nLegacy.\nThe story of the Jamaican bobsleigh team at the 1988 Winter Olympics was turned into the 1993 movie \"Cool Runnings\". However, the film was only loosely based on actual events, with real-life coach Pat Brown later saying that the team had never experienced any of the animosity from the other teams as depicted in the movie.\nAll of the team members returned for the 1992 Winter Olympics. However, Harris only competed in the two-man event, with his place in the four-man team taken by newcomer Ricky McIntosh. Harris and the Stokes brothers would continue to compete at the Winter Games in the bobsleigh events until the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano."

This was Andorra's seventh consecutive appearance at a Winter Olympic Games. The Andorran delegation consisted of three alpine skiers; Victor Gómez, Alex Antor, and Vicky Grau. Their best performance in any event was 24th place by Grau in the women's slalom.\nBackground.\nThe Andorran Olympic Committee was recognized by the International Olympic Committee on 31 December 1974. They first participated in Olympic competition at the 1976 Winter Olympics and have taken part in every Summer and Winter Olympics since. This was Andorra's seventh consecutive appearance at a Winter Olympics. Andorra had never won a medal in either the Summer or Winter Olympics. The 2002 Winter Olympics were held from 8–24 February 2002; a total of 2,399 athletes took part representing 77 National Olympic Committees. The Andorran delegation to Salt Lake City consisted of three alpine skiers; Victor Gómez, Alex Antor, and Vicky Grau. Gómez was selected as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony and for the closing ceremony.\nAlpine skiing.\nVictor Gómez was 27 years old at the time of the Salt Lake City Olympics, and was a veteran of the Albertville, Lillehammer, and Nagano Winter Olympics. Vicky Grau was 26 years old, and had also participated in all three of those Olympics with her compatriot Gómez. Alex Antor was 22 years old, and making his Olympic debut. He would later represent Andorra again at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin.\nGrau competed in two races, the women's slalom and the women's giant slalom. First for her, on 20 February, was the slalom. She posted run times of 58.13 seconds and a faster second run of 57.03 seconds. Her combined time was 1 minute and 55.16 seconds, which placed her 24th out of 38 competitors who finished both legs of the race, the gold medal was won by Janica Kostelić of Croatia in a time of 1 minute and 46.10 seconds, the silve rmedal was won by Laure Pequegnot of France, and the bronze by Anja Pärson of Sweden. Two days later she participated in the giant slalom, finishing her first leg in a time of 1 minute and 21.24 seconds. She did not finish the second run, and therefore went unranked for the event; the gold medal was again won by Kostelić, the silver medal by Pärson, and the bronze was taken by Sonja Nef of Switzerland.\nOn 21 February, both Gómez and Antor took part in the men's giant slalom. Gómez finished the first run in 1 minute and 17.83 seconds and the second in 1 minute and 15.50 seconds. He finished in 39th place with a time of 2 minutes and 33.33 seconds. Antor was a little faster, he completed his first run in 1 minute and 16.66 seconds and his second in 1 minute and 14.73 seconds. His total time was 2 minutes and 31.39 seconds, which was enough for 36th place, out of 57 classified finishers. The gold medal in the giant slalom was won by Stephan Eberharter of Austria in a time of 2 minutes and 23.28 seconds, the silver medal was won by Bode Miller of the United States, and the bronze by Lasse Kjus of Norway. On 23 February, Antor participated in the men's slalom, finishing the first leg in 54.57 seconds. However, he did not finish the second leg, and was eliminated from the event.

As well as organising local and regional competitions in UAE, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Oman, the AGRFU administered representative Arabian Gulf rugby teams and hosted the annual Dubai round of the Sevens World Series and 2009 Rugby World Cup Sevens in Dubai.\nHistory.\nRugby in the Arabian Peninsula was first played in the 1940s by the British military and expatriate oil workers in Kuwait. By 1974, rugby clubs had also been established in UAE (Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah), Saudi Arabia (Dhahran), Qatar (Doha), and Bahrain. The GRFU (Gulf Rugby Football Union) was founded in that year, under the umbrella of the English RFU along with a referees association. To begin with, many matches were played on sand but today almost all are played on grass pitches.\nThe AGRFU was formed in 1989 with the emphasis being on the Union being the Arabian Gulf and, in its own right, became a member of the International Rugby Football Board (now known as World Rugby) in 1990. Through its regional development program, the AGRFU also helped facilitate the entry of Lebanon and Jordan into international rugby. THE AGRFU played in the Hong Kong 7s in 1992 and the Rugby World Cup 7s Qualifying Tournament in Catania, Sicily in 1993, its first representative international competition. This was followed by its first 'home' international against Kenya, held in Dubai, in 1995.\nWorld Rugby's governance restructuring project for the West Asia region resulted in the AGRFU being dissolved at the end of 2010 to allow separate national unions administer the game in each member country. The UAE Rugby Federation was formed in 2009 and the UAE national team inherited the former Arabian Gulf team's world ranking, while separate federations in Qatar and Saudi Arabia became the new sports governing bodies for those countries."

Yale finished with 9–0–1 records both years, and he was named an All-American both seasons. As head coach, Jones led Yale football to a 5–3–1 record versus Harvard, and gave the most revered pregame pep talk in Yale athletic history before the Harvard–Yale game in 1923. Before that contest Jones intoned famously, \"Gentlemen, you are about to play football against Harvard. Never again may you do something so important.\" Yale won 13-0, with Babe Ruth providing broadcast commentary. Ducky Pond returned a Harvard fumble sixty-three yards for a touchdown. Bill Mallory kicked the extra point and two field goals. The Yale team was 8-0 for the season.\nFamily and honors.\nJones's older brother was Howard Jones, who also played at Yale from 1905 to 1907. The elder Jones also coached at Yale and Syracuse, as well as Ohio State University, the University of Iowa, Duke University, and the University of Southern California.\nThe \"T.A.D. Jones\" room at the gymnasium of Phillips Exeter Academy, where he taught, is named for Jones.\nThomas Albert Dwight \"Tad\" Jones is entombed in a private crypt in Woodside Cemetery &amp; Arboretum in Middletown, OH"

A skateboard is propelled by pushing with one foot while the other remains on the board, or by pumping in structures such as a pool or half-pipe. A skateboard can also be used by simply standing on the board while on a downward slope and allowing gravity to propel the board and rider."

        "text": "Edward A. Doherty (July 25, 1918 – January 2, 2000) was an American football player and coach. He served as head football coach at Arizona State University (1947–1950), the University of Rhode Island (1951), the University of Arizona (1957–1958), Xavier University (1959–1961), and the College of the Holy Cross (1971–1975), compiling a career college football record of 67–83–3. He is the only person to serve as head coach for in-state rivals Arizona and Arizona State.\nPlaying career.\nDoherty played quarterback at Boston College from 1941 to 1943. He was nicknamed \"The Brain\" for his innovative style. When most of the Boston College coaching staff left for military duty in 1943, Doherty, then a senior, was a finalist for the job of head coach. The job would eventually go to line coach Moody Sarno. Doherty was drafted by the Washington Redskins in the fifth round (39th overall) of the 1944 NFL Draft, but instead joined the United States Navy.\nCoaching career.\nAfter one season as an assistant at Notre Dame in 1946, Doherty became head coach at Arizona State, where he compiled a 25–17 record from 1947 to 1950. He left after ASU five days after defeating rival Arizona, 47–13, because he felt that he didn't have enough job security.\nIn 1951, he coached at Rhode Island on a temporary basis after head coach Hal Kopp was called to Army active duty. He compiled a 3–5 record in his only season as coach. From 1952 to 1954, Doherty coached high school football at Punchard High School (1952) and Lawrence High School in Massachusetts (1953–1954). He returned to college football in 1957 after one season as an assistant with the Philadelphia Eagles. From 1957 to 1958, Doherty coached at Arizona, where he compiled a 4–15–1 record. Unlikely to be brought back for a third season, Doherty resigned and became head coach of Xavier University.\nAfter two years out of the game, Doherty returned to coaching in 1964 as the head coach of St. Augustine High School in San Diego, California. From 1965 to 1970 he was head coach at St. Mary's High School in Phoenix, Arizona. From 1967 to 1969, Doherty coached St. Mary's to three straight state championship games, winning in 1967 and 1968. From 1971 to 1975, he coached at Holy Cross, where he compiled a 20–31–2 record. After leaving Holy Cross, Doherty returned to Arizona, where he coached Salpointe Catholic High School from 1978 to 1982 and was the school's athletic director until 1990. He coached the Lancers to the 1981 state championship game.\nHonors.\nIn 1991, Salpointe Catholic named their new stadium in honor of Doherty. The Active 20-30 Clubs of Arizona also honored Doherty by naming their high school football player of the year trophy the Ed Doherty Award."

Young was also captain of the Red Wings from 1935 to 1938 leading the team to two Stanley Cup wins. The original (cup) belts are on display in the NHL hall of fame. \nPlaying career.\nJunior hockey.\nYoung had a great start to his hockey career when he was part of the 1926 Memorial Cup champion Calgary Canadians. He followed this feat by joining the Canadian Professional Hockey League as a member of the Kitchener Millionaires (later renamed the Toronto Millionaires) and playing sound defensive hockey. The IHL took notice and Young transferred to the Cleveland Indians to start the 1929 season. For two more seasons he continued to display his defensive talent until finally the NHL took notice.\nProfessional hockey.\nWithin a two-month span in 1931, Young was claimed by the Philadelphia Quakers in an Inter-league draft, claimed by the New York Americans in the Dispersal Draft, and traded to the Detroit Falcons for Ron Martin. So finally, on October 18, 1931, Young had found his NHL home with the Detroit Falcons. In the 1931–32 season Young made his NHL debut and posted a career-high ten goals in his rookie campaign. He would continue to knock in a few goals and play sound defensive hockey for Detroit (now renamed the Detroit Red Wings) and in the 1935–36 season, he helped them win the Stanley Cup. Young missed most of the 1937 season with an injury, but his name was still engraved on the Stanley Cup. He was Captain of the Red Wings from 1935–38. He was selected to appear in his first All-Star Game in 1939.\nPrior to 1940, Young was signed as a free agent by the Montreal Canadiens, where he would play his last 50 games in the NHL. Young was claimed on waivers by the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1940 and was set down to their farm team, the Providence Reds of the American Hockey League. Young finished out his career scoring 22 points for the Reds in the 1940–41 season.\nRetirement.\nAfter his retirement in 1941 Doug Young went on to pursue a career as an On-Ice Official for the NHL and to work for the Detroit Red Wings home office."

PIFBS has helped leagues in the Dominican Republic, Poland, Haiti, Nicaragua, Ghana, Israel, Ukraine, India, China and the hurricane-affected Gulf Coast region of the United States.\nHistory.\nPIFBS was founded shortly after Hurricane Katrina. The organization sent donated equipment to the devastated areas to help revive their local youth baseball leagues. PIFBS continues to help communities affected by natural disasters. In June 2011, they donated equipment to people in Joplin, Missouri, after the string of tornados in that area. The organization also works with privileged communities including those around Philadelphia. \nPIFBS has sent equipment to Europe and is credited with helping raise the popularity of baseball in Europe. The Uganda little league team that competed in the 2012 Little League World Series received its equipment from PIFBS. This was captured by filmmaker Jay Shapiro for the 2015 documentary \"Opposite Field\". Shapiro spent two years in Uganda filming baseball players and documenting the country's baseball community.\n\"Pitch in for Baseball (PIFB)\" became \"Pitch in for Baseball and Softball\" in 2018, when PIFB launched Pitch in for Softball (PIFS) to donate softball equipment as well.

        "text": "The NC State Wolfpack men's basketball team represents North Carolina State University in NCAA Division I men's basketball competition. NC State is one of the seven founding members of the Atlantic Coast Conference. \nPrior to joining the ACC in 1954, the Wolfpack were members of the Southern Conference, where they won seven conference championships. As a member of the ACC, the Wolfpack has won eleven conference championships, as well as two national championships in 1974 and 1983.\nSince 1999, the Pack has played most of its home games at PNC Arena, which is also where the NCAA championship trophies are kept. Prior to 1999, they played at Reynolds Coliseum.\nHistory.\nNC State began varsity intercollegiate competition in men's basketball in 1911. In 105 years of play, the Wolfpack ranks 25th in total victories among NCAA Division I college basketball programs and 26th in winning percentage among programs that have competed at the Division I level for at least 26 years. The team's all-time record is 1782-1114 (.615).\nThe program saw its greatest success during the head coaching tenures of Everett Case (1946–1965), Norm Sloan (1967–1980), and Jim Valvano (1980–1990).\nNC State has produced some of the ACC's best players, including Tom Burleson, Rodney Monroe, Monte Towe, and Ron Shavlik. David Thompson, who led the Wolfpack to its first NCAA title in 1974, has been recognized as one of college basketball's greatest players.\n The Wolfpack has won a total of 18 conference tournament championships and 13 regular season conference titles. State has appeared in the NCAA tournament 29 times, with four Final Four appearances (1950, 1974, 1983, 2024) and two national titles (1974, 1983). The Wolfpack also appeared in the Final Four of the 1947 National Invitational Tournament, which was during the NIT's \"national championship era.\"\nNC State achieved its 1,700th overall win against Presbyterian College, 86-68, becoming the 26th NCAA school to reach such an achievement.\nThe early years (1910–1945).\nIn 1910 Guy Bryan formed a special committee that proposed to the university administration the organization of the school's first basketball team. The program played its first official intercollegiate basketball game on February 16, 1911, against a much more experienced squad from Wake Forest. NC State, then known as the North Carolina A&amp;M Farmers, lost, 33–6. The two teams met again five days later in Raleigh, with A&amp;M earning its first-ever victory, 19–18. The following year, the school's athletics council officially recognized basketball as a sport.\nBefore the 1920–21 season the university changed its name from North Carolina A&amp;M to North Carolina State College. At that time the school's nickname was the \"Tech.\" That season the program joined the fledgling Southern Conference as a charter member. State College changed its nickname yet again in 1923, this time to the \"Red Terrors.\" The name was drawn from a combination of the play of Rochelle \"Red\" Johnson and the team's new bright red road uniforms. Also in 1923, State opened its first basketball facility, Frank Thompson Gym. The gym, named in honor of a former athlete from the school who died in action during World War I, served as the team's home until 1948. During the first years of the program, the team had no practice facility and was forced to practice on an outdoor field in nearby Pullen Park.\nGus Tebell took over the basketball team as head coach in 1924. During his tenure he led the program to a number of school firsts, including the first conference championship in 1929 and the first 20-win season. He compiled a then all-time program best career coaching record at 79–36. The Wolfpack's first player to garner significant national recognition was Bud Rose, who, after the 1931–32 season, was named as an honorable mention All-American.\nIn 1941 the university began construction on William Neal Reynolds Coliseum, a multi-purpose arena that would serve as the new home of Wolfpack basketball. Construction was stalled due to the involvement of the United States in World War II, and the skeleton structure of the arena was left unfinished for nearly six years until its completion in 1949. The Wolfpack would play its home games at Reynolds for the next 50 years, until the men's team moved to PNC Arena in 1999.\nEverett Case era (1946–1965).\nFollowing the end of World War II, chancellor John W. Harrelson and athletic director H.A. Fisher set upon rebuilding the university's athletic teams. In 1946 David Clark, a former president of the NC State Alumni Association, suggested to the Athletics Council that the best place to search for a new head basketball coach would be in Indiana, which was a basketball hotbed at the time. Per Clark's suggestion, Harrelson and his father Stejem Mark met with Indiana native Chuck Taylor who was in Raleigh to coach his army team in an exhibition game against NC State. Taylor's recommendation for the job was his former high school coach Everett Case. When approached by Harrelson about the job, Case was at first hesitant because of the tight restrictions under which the program had been operating. Harrelson assured Case that he would be given an expanded budget and more than enough scholarships to field a competitive team. Additionally, Case was lured by the still unfinished Reynolds Coliseum. He accepted the job almost immediately without ever visiting the campus.\nSix consecutive Southern Conference titles.\nEverett Case was named head coach on July 1, 1946. Case had previously coached high school basketball in Indiana, where in 23 seasons he compiled a 726–75 record and won four state championships at Frankfort, High School. Before arriving at NC State, he spent two years as an assistant coach at the University of Southern California and spent several years coaching teams at various Naval bases during the war. In February 1947, his first season at NC State, Case defeated North Carolina in Chapel Hill, 48–46 in overtime, beginning a streak of 15 consecutive victories over the Tar Heels. Later that month, an afternoon game in Thompson Gym against Duke was postponed by city fire officials because of overcrowding. That evening the game was officially canceled after fans were found sneaking through bathroom windows, breaking down doors, and hiding in the basement. Less than three weeks later, Case guided the Red Terrors to their first Southern Conference championship in 18 years. Case and his team celebrated by performing an Indiana high school tradition of cutting down the nets. The tradition soon spread to college teams across the nation and survives amongst championship teams to this day. Soon after his arrival, Case was named \"Tar Heel of the Week\" by the Raleigh \"News and Observer\", citing that \"since the little man came here from Indiana...basketball has almost supplanted politics as the favorite topic of discussion in the North Carolina capital.\" In Case's second season as head coach the team changed its nickname from the Red Terrors to the Wolfpack.\nIn February 1948, Case made alterations to the design of the still incomplete Reynolds Coliseum. Attempting to usurp Duke's Cameron Indoor Stadium as the largest basketball arena in the area, Case insisted that the blueprints be changed to increase the maximum capacity from 9,000 seats to 12,400. Construction resumed later that month after a final shipment of steel arrived in Raleigh. Reynolds officially opened its doors on December 2, 1949, with a Wolfpack win over Washington &amp; Lee, 67–47, in front of a crowd of 11,020. At that time, the arena was the largest college basketball facility in the southeast. Soon after Reynolds' opening, the \"Greensboro News &amp; Record\" wrote that Raleigh had become \"the basketball capital of the world. Immediately, at once.\"\nLater that month, December 28–30, the first annual Dixie Classic tournament was held in Reynolds. The Dixie Classic was a three-day tournament held each December until 1961 that matched the four Tobacco Road schools of NC State, North Carolina, Duke, and Wake Forest against four of the top teams from across the country. In its time the Dixie Classic became the largest regular season tournament in college basketball. After finishing the season at 27–6 and winning its fourth consecutive Southern Conference tournament, the Wolfpack received invitations to both the National Invitation Tournament and the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. Case declined the NIT bid and accepted the invitation to the program's first ever NCAA Tournament. The team defeated Holy Cross before losing to eventual champion City College of New York, 78–73. NC State went on to defeat Baylor in the third-place game, 53–41. The Wolfpack won its fifth consecutive Southern Conference title in 1951 and its sixth the following year. Both seasons ended in early exits from the NCAA Tournament, though. In 1951 State defeated Villanova in the first round before losing to Illinois. In 1952 the team lost in the first round to St. John's and future North Carolina head coach Frank McGuire.\nThe Wolfpack's six-year winning streak against North Carolina came to an end in January 1953, as the Wolfpack, ranked #17 in the country, lost to the unranked Tar Heels in Raleigh, 70–69. It was the first match between the two schools since the hiring of Frank \"the man\" McGuire the previous summer. McGuire inflamed NC State players and fans by having his players cut down the nets in Reynolds Coliseum following the victory. Despite the loss, the Pack finished first in the conference at 13–3 but lost in the conference tournament championship game. The team was ranked 18th in the final AP poll of 1953 but was left out of the NCAA Tournament for the first time in four years.\nThe move to the ACC.\nBy the end of the 1952–53 season the Southern Conference had bloated to 17 members and was still seen as a football-centric conference. Maryland and Duke had become national football powers and there weren't many schools in the conference that could regularly compete against them. In an effort to create a more balanced round-robin schedule and thus secure an automatic bid to the Orange Bowl, the top eight football schools from the conference—Maryland, Duke, UNC, Virginia, South Carolina, Clemson, Wake Forest, and NC State—left to form the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nNC State's first ACC contest was on the road against Wake Forest in December 1953. The Wolfpack was ranked #8 in the nation at the time, but just as in the first ever meeting between the two schools, Wake Forest prevailed. Case and his squad defeated the Demon Deacons later that season in the first-ever ACC Tournament championship game, 82–80 in overtime. The victory meant a return trip to the NCAA tournament, where NC State defeated George Washington in the first round before losing to eventual champion La Salle in the second round. Case's squad won a second ACC title the following year, defeating Duke in 87–77 in the championship game. The team finished with a 28–4 record but was ineligible for postseason play; earlier in the season the NCAA imposed four years' probation and banned them from postseason play during that time for numerous recruiting violations. The Wolfpack brought home a third consecutive ACC title in the 1955–56 season, setting a record for consecutive ACC championships that stood until 2002. The team also played in its first televised game earlier that season, losing to North Carolina in Chapel Hill, 73–69. State struggled in the 1956–57 season, finishing fifth in the conference for the first time under Case. State's loss in the first round of that year's ACC tournament also marked the first time that Case did not lead his team to the conference championship game. To add insult to injury, bitter rival North Carolina brought the ACC its first national championship. The team finished third in 1958 and was ranked 20th in the nation at the season's end but again lost early in the ACC tournament, this time to North Carolina in the quarterfinals.\nThe 1958 Dixie Classic brought to Reynolds Coliseum some of the most talented teams ever assembled for the tournament. Included in the field were eight players who eventually earned All-American honors, including NC State's Lou Pucillo and John Richter, North Carolina's Lee Shaffer, York Larese, and Doug Moe, Cincinnati's Oscar Robertson, Michigan State's Johnny Green, and Louisville's Don Goldstein. Later that season, NC State, ranked #10 in the nation, defeated North Carolina, ranked #5, 80–56 to win their fourth ACC championship in six seasons. However, due to the 1956 sanctions, they were ineligible for the NCAA Tournament. The Pack finished the season ranked #6 with a 22–4 record.\nCase's final years.\nThe 1959–60 Wolfpack team finished with an 11–15 record, marking Case's first losing season in Raleigh. The team finished fourth in the ACC in 1961 and third in 1962 but lost in the first round of the conference tournament both seasons. In the summer of 1962, Case, then 62 years old, hired his former player and then Clemson head coach Press Maravich to be his top assistant. Case's health began to deteriorate rapidly over the following two seasons as the Wolfpack finished fifth in the ACC in 1963 and seventh in 1964. The seventh-place finish was the lowest of Case's tenure and would prove to be his last. On December 7, 1964, just two games into the season, Everett Case retired and named Maravich as his successor. During his tenure, Case won six Southern Conference titles, four ACC titles, and qualified for the NCAA Tournament twice. His overall record of 377–134 remains the best in NC State history.\nMaravich led the Pack to second-place finish in the conference and an ACC championship, its first in six years. After State defeated eighth-ranked Duke in the championship game, 91–85, Case, by then using a wheelchair, was rolled on court to cut the final strand from the net. Maravich had originally been hired in part because of his son Pete Maravich, who at the time was a highly touted high school player. After Pete failed to qualify academically at NC State, he accepted a scholarship to play at LSU. After the 1965–66 season, Press Maravich resigned as head coach of the Wolfpack to follow Pete to LSU. NC state finished eighth in the ACC in Maravich's final year. On April 30, 1966, the day after Maravich announced that he was leaving, Everett Case died while in a Raleigh hospital.\nNorm Sloan era (1967–1980).\nJust a week after Maravich's exit, former Wolfpack basketball and football player Norm Sloan was hired as the new head coach. In 1967–68, his first season, Sloan's team finished the regular season third in the ACC with a 9–5 conference record. State made it as far as the ACC championship game before losing to North Carolina 87–50, but it was the Pack's semifinal game against tenth-ranked Duke that is most remembered. Sloan realized that his team was vastly undersized against the Blue Devils. He decided, however, to use the Wolfpack's quickness to its advantage and keep the ball away from the Duke players for as much of the game as possible. Using a tactic he coined \"stall-ball,\" Sloan instructed his players to hold the ball at halfcourt and slow the game down as much as possible. The final result was the lowest scoring game in ACC Tournament history. Duke led 4–2 at halftime and the Wolfpack held the ball for more than 13 straight minutes in the second half. In the end, State prevailed 12–10.\nThe following season marked another historic first in the Wolfpack program, as on December 2, 1968, Al Heartly debuted as the school's first African-American basketball player. Heartly had a solid three-year career at NC State and was named a team captain as a senior.\nNC State won Sloan's first ACC title, and sixth overall, in Sloan's third season, 1969–70. The team finished the regular season at 23–7 overall and third in the conference. In the conference championship game, the Pack defeated third-ranked South Carolina 42–39 in double overtime. With the victory, the Wolfpack was invited to its first NCAA Tournament in five years. State received a bye in the first round of the tournament and lost its first game to St. Bonaventure in the semifinals, 80–68. In the Eastern Regional third-place game, the Pack defeated Niagara, 108–88. Despite State's quick exit from the tournament, Sloan's squad finished the season ranked tenth in the AP poll, its first end-of-the-season ranking since being ranked sixth following the 1958–59 season.\nDuring the spring of 1970, just after the season's end, Sloan signed Tom Burleson. Burleson, a 7'4\" native of Newland, NC, was the first major player of the Wolfpack squad that would have a combined record of 57–1 during the 1972–73 and 1973–74 seasons to be signed. The following spring, Sloan signed the remaining pieces of the 1974 championship nucleus, 6'4\" David Thompson, 5'7\" point guard Monte Towe, and 6'7\" power forward Tim Stoddard. At the time, the NCAA prohibited freshmen from competing on varsity squads and the team struggled in the following two seasons, finishing seventh in the ACC in 1970–71 and fifth in 1971–72. At 13–14 overall, the 1970–71 season was Sloan's worst and his only losing season as the Wolfpack head coach.\nWith the addition of Thompson, Towe, and Stoddard to the starting lineup in 1972–73, the team rebounded quickly from its recent struggles. David Thompson, later known as \"Skywalker\" for his 44-inch vertical leap, impressed in his 1972 debut as a sophomore. In what was a 130–53 rout of Appalachian State, Thompson scored 33 points and collected 13 rebounds. On January 14, 1973, NC State played in the first nationally televised Super Bowl Sunday college basketball matchup. The third-ranked Wolfpack defeated second-ranked Maryland in College Park, 87–85. The two teams met again two months later in the ACC Tournament championship game. State won another narrow victory over the Terrapins, 76–74, to finish the season at a perfect 27–0. However, due to NCAA sanctions resulting from violations during Thompson's recruiting, the team was barred from postseason participation.\n1974 National Championship.\nThe NCAA sanctions against the Wolfpack were lifted after the 1972–73 season. Ranked second nationally in the first AP poll of the season, the team was poised to make another strong run. State began the season with a pair of games against East Carolina and Vermont, which it won by a combined score of 176–87. The third game of the season was against seven-time defending national champions UCLA and coach John Wooden. The Pack came out sluggish and was easily defeated, 84–66. It would prove to be the team's only loss in two seasons, though, as the Pack tore through the ACC, finishing the regular season at 24–1 overall. As the team continued to rack up victories, its national ranking rose accordingly. On February 19, with just four regular season games remaining, NC State overtook UCLA for the top spot in the AP poll; it was the program's first ever #1 ranking.\nAs the top seed in the conference tournament, the Wolfpack received a bye in the first round. In the semifinals State easily defeated Virginia, 87–66. In the championship game the team faced off against fourth-ranked Maryland, which had lost by only six points in each of the teams' regular season meetings. Maryland jumped to an early 25–12 lead, hitting 12 of its first 14 shots. The Wolfpack cut the deficit to five points at halftime, but momentum shifted throughout the second half. NC State led by four late in the game, but Maryland closed the gap and sent the game to overtime, tied at 97. The Wolfpack, led by Tom Burleson's 38 points, won 103–100 in what has been heralded as one of the greatest college basketball games ever played.\nBack in the NCAA Tournament for the first time in four seasons, Sloan and his team played their first two games on their home court. They defeated their first two opponents, Providence and Pittsburgh, by a combined 32 points to set up a Final Four rematch with UCLA. In the week leading up to the game, thousands of fans packed Reynolds Coliseum to watch the Wolfpack practice. When the two teams finally met in Greensboro, it was another tight contest for the Pack. After ending regulation tied at 65, each team scored only two points in the first overtime. UCLA took a seven-point lead in the second extra period, but NC State led by David Thompson, took the lead for the final time with 34 seconds to play. State went on to win, 80–77, and advanced to the national championship game against Marquette.\nThe championship game, played two nights later, was much less competitive than the previous contest. The game was close in the first half until Marquette coach Al McGuire received two technical fouls and was ejected from the game. McGuire's exit sparked a 10–0 Wolfpack run just before halftime. NC State led by as much as 19 points in the second half and ultimately won, 76–64.\nThompson left NC State after his senior season in 1975 as the school's most decorated player. He won every major national player of the year award in 1975, in addition to being a three-time consensus First-Team All-America honoree, a three-time unanimous First-Team All-ACC honoree, and a three-time ACC Player of the Year winner. In his 86 games, Thompson scored 2,309 points (26.8 ppg); he still holds the Wolfpack records for points scored in a single season (838 in 1974–75) and points scored in a single game (57 in 1974). His #44 jersey remains the only retired jersey in NC State history, though others have been honored. In early 2024, a statue of Thompson was placed outside Reynolds Coliseum.\nSloan remained head coach through the 1979–80 season. His last team (1979–80) team reached the NCAA Tournament, losing to Iowa in the second round. Also, twice during his final six seasons in Raleigh his teams played in the NIT. In 1976, the Pack advanced to the semifinals and in 1978, it defeated South Carolina, Detroit, and Georgetown before falling to Texas in the championship game. In his final season, he led the program to its 1000th victory. After resigning from NC State, Sloan returned to Florida, where he had previously coached from 1961 to 1965.\nJim Valvano era (1980–1990).\nFollowing Sloan's exit, Jim Valvano was hired as head coach on March 27, 1980. Valvano had previously coached at Iona, where he compiled a 94–47 record over five seasons. Valvano's teams saw incremental improvement in his first two seasons, finishing seventh in the ACC in 1981 and fourth in 1982.\n1983 National Championship.\nExpectations were high before the 1982–83 season, but a foot injury to Dereck Whittenburg slowed the team to a fourth place regular season finish. Whittenburg returned to the court in time for the ACC tournament, which most believed the Pack needed to win in order to secure a second consecutive berth in the NCAA Tournament. State did just that, defeating heavily favored North Carolina and Virginia squads led by Michael Jordan and Ralph Sampson, respectively. The Wolfpack kept winning. Their close games and exciting finishes in the ACC Tournament and early rounds of the NCAA tournament earned them the moniker The Cardiac Pack. As a #6 seed in the NCAA tournament, the Wolfpack won narrow victories over Pepperdine (in double overtime) and UNLV (71–70) before defeating Utah in the Sweet Sixteen, 75–56. In the regional final, NC State again defeated Virginia, 63–62, then defeated Georgia in the Final Four to advance to the championship game against Houston. The Cougars, nicknamed Phi Slama Jama for their athletic, fast-paced style of play that featured Clyde Drexler and Hakeem Olajuwon, were expected to win easily over the underdog Wolfpack. NC State escaped with their second national title after a last-second air ball by Dereck Whittenburg was caught and dunked by Lorenzo Charles. The 54–52 final is one of the most famous in college basketball history.\nValvano's 1984 team finished 7th in the ACC and lost in the first round of the NIT to future conference foe Florida State. The following season, with the addition of guard Vinny Del Negro, the Pack began a run of five consecutive trips to the NCAA Tournament. The Pack reached the Elite Eight in 1985 and 1986 and the Sweet Sixteen in 1989. In 1987, after a sixth-place finish in the regular season, NC State made another surprising run through the ACC tournament. In the championship game, State defeated rival North Carolina, which had gone undefeated in conference play. State finished second in the conference the following year and was a #3 seed in the NCAA tournament. The team made an early exit, though, losing to #14 seed Murray State in the first round.\nValvano's final season in Raleigh was mired in controversy after the release of the book, \"Personal Fouls\", written by Peter Golenbock. In the book, Golenbock alleged improper practices and a lack of institutional control in the NC State athletics department. The allegations included grade fixing, lowered or waived entrance requirements for athletes, the selling of tickets and sneakers by athletes, and frequent drug use by athletes. The claims were refuted by Valvano and Chancellor Bruce Poulton, claiming that some of the players might have sold some of their shoes, most notably to ACC superfan Jason Bass. The NCAA investigation, and 5 additional investigations by separate entities found only that players indeed sold shoes and their complimentary game tickets for spending money. Nonetheless, the NCAA banned NC State from postseason play for the 1989-90 season. Earlier, NC State limited itself to only 12 total scholarships for 1990-91 and 1991-92. Although Valvano was not named in the NCAA report at all, new chancellor Larry Monteith forced his resignation on April 7, 1990.\nLes Robinson era (1990–1996).\nTo replace Valvano, NC State turned to East Tennessee State coach Les Robinson, who had played for Case in the 1960s. Robinson was the 1991 District Coach of the Year as selected by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) after leading NC State to a 20–11 record in the first season. He was the first first-year coach in ACC history to win 20 games, post a winning regular season conference record, and win games in both the ACC and NCAA Tournaments. The only other coach to pull off this feat is North Carolina's Bill Guthridge.\nHowever, the lost scholarships took their full effect a year later, and the Wolfpack plummeted into the ACC's second division for the next five years. The low point of Robinson's tenure at his alma mater came during the 1992–93 season. Due to injuries and academic-related suspensions, Robinson was only able to dress seven players for most conference games. They ultimately finished 8–19, the worst record in modern Wolfpack history.\nIn 1992 the ACC Tournament was expanded because of the addition of Florida State. A play-in game between the eighth and ninth place teams was created, and during his five years as the N.C. State coach after its addition, Robinson's Wolfpack played in the play-in game four out of five times (finishing seventh in 1992). Because of his team's traditional appearance in the Thursday night play-in game, the game became known as the \"Les Robinson Invitational\" by ACC fans. The play-in game was discontinued when the ACC expanded to include Miami and Virginia Tech, and required three Thursday games. With the later addition of Boston College, there are now four games on Thursday.\nLes Robinson would stay on as head coach through the 1995–96 season. While he never tallied another winning record, his stint went a long way towards cleansing the image of the program to both insiders and outsiders. Robinson was appointed NC State's athletic director in 1996 and stepped down as head coach. He left to become The Citadel's athletic director in 2000.\nHerb Sendek era (1996–2006).\nSendek was hired at NC State in 1996 after three years of success at Miami (Ohio), his first head coaching experience. He immediately improved upon the Les Robinson era, winning 17 games for the program's first winning record in six years. In his first year at NC State, the Wolfpack also finished the year winning eight of 11 games, advanced to the finals of the ACC Tournament, and earned a trip to the postseason in the NIT.\nSendek coached NC State to the NCAA tournament five consecutive years from 2002 until 2006 (tying the school record). He had his most success during these last five years, winning his 100th game at NC State in 2002 and having a winning conference record in each year but one. In 2004, Sendek won ACC Coach of the Year and Julius Hodge, one of Sendek's most prized recruits during his NC State tenure, won the ACC Men's Basketball Player of the Year. In 2005, NC State upset defending champion Connecticut in the second round of the NCAA tournament to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, NC State's deepest run into the tournament during Sendek's years. Sendek finished his NC State coaching career with a 71–88 record in the ACC and a 32–87 record against RPI top 50 teams. On April 3, 2006, Sendek accepted the head coaching job at Arizona State.\nSidney Lowe era (2006–2011).\nSidney Lowe was named head coach in May 2006 after a month-long search that included such targets as Rick Barnes, John Beilein, John Calipari, and Steve Lavin. Lowe's first season got off to a good start as the Wolfpack won its first five games. State's first three ACC contests were losses, however, and the team finished the regular season at 15–14, tenth place in the ACC at 5–11. Despite depth issues, the squad made a surprising run to the ACC Tournament championship game in Tampa, winning three games in three days before losing to North Carolina, 89–80. The Wolfpack was given a berth in the NIT, its first since 2000. There the Pack defeated Drexel on the road and Marist in Reynolds Coliseum before losing in the third round at West Virginia. After the season, Lowe was rewarded with a contract extension lasting through the 2012–13 season, but after a disappointing 2010–11 season, Lowe resigned his position as NC State's coach.\nLowe was revered for his role as starting point guard on the \"Cardiac Pack\" team that won the 1983 NCAA championship. He returned to Raleigh in 2006 to replace Herb Sendek as coach, but the Wolfpack struggled to sustain any momentum in Lowe's five seasons. Although he made the NIT twice, he never made the NCAA tournament as a coach, and never finished higher than ninth place in the ACC. He went 86–78, including just 25–55 in ACC play. Lowe was 3–16 record against rivals Duke and North Carolina, with two of those wins coming in his first year.\nMark Gottfried era (2011–2017).\nMark Gottfried was named head coach on April 5, 2011. In his first season as head coach of NC State, Mark Gottfried recorded a 22–12 overall regular season record, including a 9–7 regular season record in the ACC, and reached the semifinals of the ACC tournament. Mark Gottfried recorded the second best season by a first-year coach at State, second only to Everett Case. Gottfried's first Wolfpack team earned a #11 seed in the 2012 NCAA Tournament. The Pack won in the tournament over sixth seeded San Diego State and third seeded Georgetown to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, where it lost to second seeded Kansas. They finished the season ranked #20 in the AP Poll.\nEntering the 2012–13 season, expectations ran high for Gottfried's second season as head coach. The Wolfpack returned four starters from its 2012 Sweet Sixteen squad and were joined by a trio of talented freshman, each of whom were selected as McDonald's All Americans. As a result, NC State started the season ranked #6 in the AP preseason poll, the Wolfpack's second-highest preseason ranking in program history. Additionally, NC State was voted as preseason favorite to win the ACC title in the conference's annual media survey and the inaugural league coaches’ poll. Ultimately, the team did not live up to media expectations. 24–11 overall, The Wolfpack finished tied for fourth in the ACC regular season standings with a 24–11 overall record (11–7 ACC) and as a #8 seed lost its first game in the second round of the 2013 NCAA tournament to Temple.\nMark Gottfried began his third season as head coach of the Wolfpack having lost five of seven players who logged significant minutes (four of which were starters). They struggled for most of the season, finishing 9–9 in ACC play. However, the Wolfpack surprised many by making the semifinals of the ACC tournament by upsetting #11 Syracuse, who entered the tournament as a second seed. They eventually lost to a third seeded Duke team. They were selected as a #12 seed in the 2014 NCAA tournament, where they won over Xavier in the First Four before losing in the second round to St. Louis. They finished the season 22–14.\nComing into Gottfried's fourth season, NC State had lost T. J. Warren, the ACC's leading scorer the previous year, to the NBA draft. They also lost point guard Tyler Lewis, who transferred to Butler. They finished 19–12 with a 10–8 ACC record. NC State upset Jahlil Okafor and #2 Duke on January 11, nearly two years after upsetting them in the same place in 2013. They also upset #15 UNC in the Dean Smith Center for the first time since 2003, holding the Heels to their lowest home point total ever. These two wins, along with wins against Louisville and Syracuse made Gottfried the first coach to beat all ACC Hall of Fame coaches in the same year. They made it to the quarterfinals of the ACC tournament where they lost to Duke, and were selected as an 8 seed in the NCAA tournament where they made the Sweet Sixteen, upsetting #1 Villanova along the way.\nIn Gottfried's fifth season, NC State lost half of its scoring threat with Trevor Lacey declaring for the draft and Ralston Turner and Desmond Lee graduating. Additionally, Kyle Washington transferred to the Cincinnati. NC State suffered a loss in their opening game against William &amp; Mary, and highly touted guard Terry Henderson suffered an ankle injury in the first 10 minutes, which resulted in him sitting out for the rest of the season. This was the beginning of a long and painful season for the Pack. NC State struggled to compete in the ACC after going 10–3 out of conference. Junior point guard, Cat Barber finished the season as the ACC's leading scorer, averaging 23.5 points per game and making the All-ACC first team. After a tough loss to Duke in the second round of the ACC Tournament, NC State finished the season 16–17 and 5–13 in the ACC, making it Gottfried's worst season to date. The Wolfpack decided to not participate in any post-season tournaments.\nExpectations ran high for Gottfried's sixth season as head coach, with a highly touted recruiting class and several key players returning such as Abdul-Malik Abu and BeeJay Anya. It was later announced that he would be fired at the end of the season.\nKevin Keatts era (2017–present).\nOn March 17, 2017, Kevin Keatts was named the head basketball coach at NC State. \nIn 2024, the Wolfpack ended the regular season 17-14 but won the ACC Tournament for the first time since 1987. The team was only the second to win their conference championship by winning five games in five days since Connecticut did so in the Big East Tournament during their 2011 national championship season.

(The second, and final, Hockey Association was formed in 1886.) An offside rule was included in the 1876 rules. Under this rule, a player who was nearer to the opponent team's goal-line than both the ball and the third to last opponent was said to be at an offside position (simply put: an attacking player was offside if the ball was behind them and there were fewer than three defenders between them and the goal they were attacking). The rule was applied on the whole pitch, except when the ball was hit from the goal-line.\n1886 rule.\nIn 1886, the second England Hockey Association drew up a code of Rules based on those used by clubs in the London area. Offside was then applied to attacking players from the half-way line only.\n1972 rule change.\nThe 1886 offside rule remained unchanged until 1972, when offside was changed from 3 to 2 defenders.\n1987 rule change.\nIn 1987, the offside was amended to apply only in the 25 yards area.\nOffside abolished.\nAfter various amendments, the offside rule was finally repealed. \"No offside\" was introduced as a mandatory experiment in 1996 and it was confirmed as a rule in 1998 by the Hockey Rules Board.

        "text": "Robert Wayne Thomas (born October 9, 1947) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Montreal Canadiens, Toronto Maple Leafs, and New York Rangers between 1972 and 1981. He also held several positions in coaching and management in the NHL and the minor leagues, including 22 years in management with the San Jose Sharks.\nPlaying career.\nThomas played junior hockey from 1963 to 1967 with the Ottawa Capitals of the Central Canada Hockey League (CCHL), and was the league's top goaltender in 1965–66. Thomas then played three years of varsity hockey at the University of Wisconsin under coach Bob Johnson. Thomas recorded a shutout in his first game with Wisconsin in 1968, an 11–0 victory against Pennsylvania. He was with the team in its first appearance in the Frozen Four tournament in Lake Placid, New York in 1970. Thomas ranks in the top 10 all-time for Wisconsin goaltenders in save percentage (.909 – 9th all-time) and goals against average (2.84 – 10th all-time) as of the 2019–20 season.\nThomas's National Hockey League rights were originally held by the Toronto Maple Leafs, who traded him to the Los Angeles Kings in 1968, and who in turn traded him to the Montreal Canadiens in 1970.\nThomas played two seasons with the Montreal and Nova Scotia Voyageurs, the American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate of the Montreal Canadiens. With the Voyageurs he won the Calder Cup, the AHL championship trophy, in 1972. The following year, he became the tenth goalie to record a shutout in his NHL debut, with a 3–0 Canadiens victory against the Vancouver Canucks. He won his first seven consecutive home starts, and overall recorded an 8–1 regular season record, but did not play in the playoffs; Thomas was the number 3 goalie behind Ken Dryden and Michel Plasse. In 1973–74, with Dryden sitting out the season to complete his bar exam, he shared duties with Plasse and Michel Larocque, playing 42 games and sporting a 2.76 goals against average, but again was not used in the playoffs. On March 10, 1974, Thomas set a Canadiens record with 53 saves in a 5–4 victory against the Pittsburgh Penguins; the record has since been tied by Carey Price. Thomas's goals against was the fourth-best average in the NHL, and was Montreal's winner of that year's Molson Cup. He then spent the entire 1974–75 season as Montreal's number 3 goalie, but did not see action in a single game as Dryden returned with Larocque as his backup. Thomas was frustrated, but appeased when Montreal general manager Sam Pollock advised him that the team intended to not utilize him but would trade him to a \"good situation\" in the off season.\nAfter three seasons in Montreal he was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in June 1975 for a first-round draft pick. He played in the 1976 All Star game and recorded the win. After two years in Toronto, he became expendable upon the emergence of Mike Palmateer, and the New York Rangers acquired him in the 1977 NHL Waiver Draft, to use him as the backup to John Davidson. When Davidson got injured, Thomas took over as the starter, playing in 41 games that season. Thomas played four seasons with the Rangers and retired in 1981.\nCoaching and management career.\nAfter retiring as a player, he was hired by the New York Rangers as a goaltending coach, one of the first in professional hockey. By January 1981, Thomas was third on the Rangers' goalie depth chart behind John Davidson and Doug Soetaert, and was seen by coach and general manager Craig Patrick to be more useful to the team as a coach; Thomas was announced to be coaching the team's goalies on January 28. He remained in that position until the end of the 1984–85 season.\nIn 1985 Thomas became the head coach of the Salt Lake Golden Eagles of the International Hockey League (IHL), a Rangers affiliate. In his second year in Salt Lake City, the Golden Eagles won the Turner Cup and Thomas was awarded the Commissioner's Trophy as the IHL's Coach of the Year.\nIn 1986, he returned to the NHL as assistant coach of the Chicago Blackhawks, a hiring based in part on his work with goalies such as Mike Vernon with the Golden Eagles, and Glen Hanlon and John Vanbiesbrouck with the Rangers. Under head coach Bob Murdoch, Thomas focused on Chicago's goalies and was involved in the development of Jimmy Waite and Ed Belfour. During the 1989–90 season, Thomas served as head coach of the St. Louis Blues' IHL affiliate, the Peoria Rivermen. In January 1990, the Blues temporarily brought him to St. Louis as a \"de facto\" goaltender coach to consult on the development of Blues prospects Vincent Riendeau and Curtis Joseph. That summer Thomas was officially named a Blues assistant coach, with specialty in goaltending, and was specifically hired by head coach Brian Sutter for his experience. Thomas stayed on as an assistant coach in 1992 when St. Louis replaced Sutter with Bob Plager.\nIn 1993, Thomas left the Blues to join the San Jose Sharks as assistant to the general manager and assistant coach. He remained in that role until the 1995–1996 season, when he was named assistant general manager. He was named vice president of the Sharks in 2001. He remained vice president and assistant general manager until his retirement in 2015.\nPersonal life.\nThomas has a bachelor's degree in physical education from the University of Wisconsin. He and his wife, Barb, have two daughters, Gretchen and Abby, and three grandchildren, Erik, Elsje, and Harrison."

        "text": "Sitting volleyball is a form of volleyball for athletes with a disability. As opposed to standing volleyball, sitting volleyball players must sit on the floor to play.\nHistory.\nSitting volleyball was invented in the Netherlands by the Dutch Sport Committee in 1956 as a rehabilitation sport for injured soldiers. \nIn 1958, the first international sitting volleyball contact was held between Germany and Dutch clubteams. \nIt was created as a combination of volleyball and sitzball, a German sport with no net and seated players. Sitting volleyball first appeared in the Toronto 1976 Paralympic games as a demonstration sport for athletes with impaired mobility, and both standing and sitting volleyball became officially included as medal sports in the Paralympic games at Arnhem in 1980. Women’s sitting volleyball was added for the Athens 2004 Paralympic Games. \nAfter the London 2012 games, VolleySLIDE was founded by Matt Rogers to promote and develop the sport globally. Eight men's and eight women's teams competed in the 2020 Tokyo Paralympic Games.\nRules.\nIn sitting volleyball, a , net is set at high for men and high for women. The court is meters with a 2-metre (6.6-foot) attack line. The rules are the same as the original form of volleyball with the exceptions that players must have at least one buttock in contact with the floor whenever they make contact with the ball and it is also possible to block the serve.\nAthletes with the following disabilities are eligible to compete in sitting volleyball: athletes with amputations, spinal cord injuries, cerebral palsy, brain injuries and stroke. Classifications of these athletes by disability are placed into two categories: MD and D. MD stands for \"Minimally Disabled,\" and D stands for “Disabled.” While Minimally Disabled athletes have lost only a fraction of their muscular strength and flexibility in a joint preventing them from successfully playing standing volleyball, Disabled athletes have lost all of their muscular strength and flexibility in that joint. \nOnly two MD players are allowed on the roster for the Paralympic Games and only one is allowed on the court at a time; this is to keep the competition fair between rival teams. The rest of the team must be classified as D players.\nSkills are largely identical to the sport of volleyball and the following game terminology apply:\nMembers.\nWorld ParaVolley\nDefunct national teams\nChampionships.\nParalympics.\nSitting volleyball was first demonstrated at the Summer Paralympic Games in 1976 and was introduced as a full Paralympic event in 1980. The 2000 games was the last time standing volleyball appeared on the Paralympic programme. The women's sitting volleyball event introduction followed in the 2004 Paralympic Games."

He was selected to represent Egypt at the 1984 Games at the age of 18, despite never having competed internationally, and in preparation spent 40 days in an Egyptian cave filled with snakes and scorpions to strengthen his mental resolve.

        "text": "The 2007 World Series of Poker (WSOP) began on June 1, 2007. The $10,000 (US) no-limit Texas hold 'em Main Event began on July 6 and was completed on the morning of July 18th. All events were held at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, by Harrah's Entertainment, which has run the annual event since its purchase from the Binion family in 2004.\nFor the first time players began each event with double the amount of chips as the buy-in. This means that players in the Main Event started with 20,000 chips. The blind structure has also been increased and some blind levels removed but slowed to allow for more play.\nIn addition to the $50,000 H.O.R.S.E. event, which was first played at the 2006 World Series of Poker, this year there were 2 additional H.O.R.S.E. events with lower buy-ins ($2,500 and $5,000).\nTom Schneider, who won 2 events and made 1 other final table, won the Player of the Year Award. Michael Binger and Chad Brown led all other players with eight money finishes.\nThe annual celebrity event was changed this year, as it became a pro and celeb event called \"Ante Up for Africa\", hosted by actor Don Cheadle and poker pro Annie Duke. The final two players, Dan Shak and Brandon Moran, agreed to share first place and donate all prize money to charities in Darfur.\nThe \"last woman standing\" of the 2007 Main Event was Maria Ho who finished in 38th place.\nAlso this year, KEM Plastic Playing Cards were once again used for the events, rather than Copag brand plastic playing cards, which were used during the 2005 and 2006 World Series of Poker.\nMain Event.\nThe $10,000 No Limit Hold'em Main Event began on July 6 with the first of four separate starting days. 6,358 players entered, 2,415 fewer than in 2006. This is the first time since 1992 that the Main Event experienced a reduction in participants. As the total number of registrants for the 2007 WSOP set a record at 54,288 with a total prize pool of $159,796,918 ($59,784,954 for the Main Event), the decrease in the number of participants in the Main Event has been attributed to a recent law that limits Internet gambling. As a result of this law, Harrah's did not allow online poker websites to directly purchase Main Event seats and offer them as prizes, if the sites conducted business with US citizens. Online entries to the Main Event that were won as prizes on Internet poker sites were a substantial contributor to the dramatic growth the Main Event seen in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006. The reduced field also meant a nearly one-third reduction in the Main Event's grand prize, from the record $12 million (US) in 2006 to $8.25 million.\nA flatter payout structure was introduced in 2007 further reducing the prize money awarded to the final table finishers. Players who busted early in the money received a larger share than they would have in 2006. The lowest payouts in 2007 were $20,320 (just over double the buyin), as compared to $14,597 in 2006. Every player who made the final table in 2006 won over 1.5 million dollars.\nA minor controversy arose during the main event. The colors of the chips made it very difficult to differentiate between the chip values. Pokernews.com posted the following note on its live reporting log, \"It has literally been impossible for us to count these players' stacks due to the positioning of the cameras and the incredibly similar colors of the various chip denominations.\" Pokernews also reported that the chip color has affected play, \"Because of the similarly-colored chips it took the dealer some time to count down Kluber's stack, and not long after Rahme began thinking about his response Kluber called the clock on him.\" Other players have complained that they can't count their opponents stacks and fear asking for a chip count as speaking may reveal the strength of their hand.\nOther notable high finishes.\n\"NB: This list is restricted to top 30 finishers with an existing Wikipedia entry.\"\nWorld Series of Poker Europe.\nUnder the leadership of WSOP commissioner, Jeffrey Pollack, the World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE) is the first expansion of the World Series of Poker. In September 2007, the first WSOP championship events outside of Las Vegas took place in London. It was the first time that WSOP bracelets were awarded outside of Las Vegas. Three tournaments were held, with the main event being a £10,000 buy-in no-limit hold 'em tournament. The main event was won by Norwegian online prodigy Annette Obrestad, who won on the day before her 19th birthday and became the youngest person ever to win a WSOP bracelet."

        "text": "The Pittsburgh Keystones was the name of two historic professional Negro league baseball teams that operated in 1887 and again in 1921 and 1922. The first team was a member of the first black baseball league in 1887, the League of Colored Baseball Clubs. The league only lasted a week, which resulted in a 3-4 record for the Keystones, and included Weldy Walker, the second African-American to play in the major leagues and future hall of famer, Sol White.\nThe second club was founded by Alexander McDonald Williams, a Barbadian immigrant and pool hall operator. The Keystones' home field was Central Park, located in the Hill District at the corner of Chauncey Street and Humber Way. The park was built by the prominent African American architect Louis Arnett Stuart Bellinger, who would later design Greenlee Field for the Pittsburgh Crawfords.\nIn their first season the Pittsburgh Keystones played as associate members of the Negro National League. Managed by Fred Downer, they compiled a 7-14-1 record against league and other associate clubs. The Keystones joined the league as full members in 1922, finishing sixth with a 14-23-2 record in league play under managers Dizzy Dismukes and Dicta Johnson. The team disbanded after the season."

Play was not held between 22 December and Christmas Day due to the Christmas break. Play resumed on Boxing Day in the lead-up to the final. A day's break was also held on New Year's Eve for the New Year. Record prize money of £100,000 for the winner was on offer.\nDespite the record field, there was a notable absentee. John Lowe's world ranking had fallen to a level which meant he was forced to qualify for the event – which he failed to do for the first time in his career. His run of 28 successive appearances (including the BDO World Championship) had come to an end. He was the last player to have appeared in a world championship each year since it began in 1978. Bob Anderson, who made his debut in 1984, now had the longest unbroken run – making his 23rd consecutive appearance for these championships.\nA major shock came in the first round when world number one and top seed Colin Lloyd lost to Gary Welding – it was only the second time in the history of the PDC World Championship that the top seed fell in the first round (Peter Manley being the first in 2001). Welding, who had recovered from two sets down in his best-of-five-sets match against Lloyd, went on to reach the quarter-finals.\nPhil Taylor became World Champion for the 13th time, this being his 11th PDC success. His toughest battle en route to the championship was a tight semi-final against Wayne Mardle which he managed to win by 6 sets to 5. The final was a more one-sided affair as Taylor overcame Peter Manley 7–0. It was Manley's third final defeat against Taylor and the second time he was whitewashed, mirroring the result of the 2002 final.\nOrder of Merit.\nOrder of Merit\nPDPA Qualifiers\nInternational Qualifiers\nRepresentation from different countries.\nThis table shows the number of players by country in the World Championship."

He paired with Eugene McCauliff to reach the doubles final at the U.S. Nationals in 1936, and to win back-to-back doubles titles in Cincinnati in 1936 and 1937. No other doubles team would win consecutive titles in Cincinnati until 69 years later when Jonas Björkman and Max Mirnyi successfully defended their 2005 Cincinnati doubles title by winning the title in 2006.\nHe also was a doubles finalist in Cincinnati in 1933.\nMcDiarmid attended Texas Christian University, and has been inducted into that school's Letterman's Association Hall of Fame, as well as the Texas Sports Hall of Fame."

He was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals as an amateur free agent before the 1949 season, and played for the Cardinals (1954–56), New York / San Francisco Giants (1957–59), Baltimore Orioles (1960–61), Kansas City Athletics (1962), Houston Colt .45s / Astros (1964–65).\nPlaying career.\nJones made his major league debut on August 6, 1954, starting game one of a doubleheader against the Pittsburgh Pirates at Forbes Field. The Cardinals lost by a score of 7–3. His rookie year of 1954 turned out to be his most successful season, as he was 4–4 with an earned run average of 2.00. Jones pitched two shutouts (August 25 against the Pirates and September 18 against the Milwaukee Braves) and allowed 18 earned runs in 81 innings.\nIn 1955 he started in 9 of his 15 appearances for St. Louis, but with much less success. His record was 1–4 with a 5.84 ERA. After that season, he pitched almost exclusively in relief.

He was fired on July 8, 1967, by manager Grady Hatton after a rift developed between Jones and some members of his pitching staff. Veteran relief pitcher Jim Owens took Jones' place and remained the Astros' mound tutor through 1972."

        "title": "Ancient Greek boxing",
        "text": "Ancient Greek boxing ( \"pygmachia\", \"fist fighting\") dates back to at least the 8th century BC (Homer's \"Iliad\"), and was practiced in a variety of social contexts in different Greek city-states. Most extant sources about ancient Greek boxing are fragmentary or legendary, making it difficult to reconstruct the rules, customs and history surrounding this activity in great detail. Still, it is clear that gloved boxing bouts were a significant part of ancient Greek athletic culture throughout the early classical period.\nOrigins.\nThere is archeological and artistic evidence of ancient Greek boxing (\"πύξ\" - \"pyx\" or \"πυγμή\" - \"pygme\" in Αncient Greek) as early as the Minoan and Mycenaean periods. There are numerous legends about the origins of boxing in Greece. One legend holds that the heroic ruler Theseus invented a form of boxing in which two men sat face to face and beat each other with their fists until one of them was killed. In time, the boxers began to fight while standing and wearing gloves (with spikes) and wrappings on their arms below the elbows, but otherwise they fought naked.\nAccording to the \"Iliad\", Mycenaean warriors included boxing among their competitions honoring the fallen, though it is possible that the Homeric epics reflect later Greek culture. Boxing was among the contests held in memorial of Achilles' slain friend Patroclus, toward the end of the Trojan war. It was in commemoration of Patroclus that the Greeks later introduced boxing (\"pygme / pygmachia\") to the Olympic Games in 688 BC. Participants trained on punching bags (called a ). Fighters wore leather straps (called himantes) over their hands (leaving the fingers free), wrists, and sometimes breast, to protect themselves from injury. There was no protection for the face or head, meaning Greek boxing was quite dangerous compared to modern day boxing. Women were prohibited to watch games, especially boxing.\nThe scholar and historian Philostratus maintained that boxing was originally developed in Sparta. The early Spartans believed helmets were unnecessary and boxing prepared them for the inevitable blows to the head they would receive in battle. However, Spartans never participated in the competitive aspect of boxing, believing the means of defeat to be dishonorable.\nEquipment.\nThe style of protection utilized on the hands and knuckles could determine the style of fighting for the competitors. From the time of the \"Iliad\" until around 500 BC, himantes were used as protection for the knuckles and hand. They were thongs of ox hide approximately long that were wrapped around the hands and knuckles numerous times. The thongs usually had loops in which an athlete could insert four of his fingers and clench them together in a fist. Generally, this was the only form of protection worn by participants from the era of Homer until the end of the fifth century. Classical sources describe these as \"soft gloves\", though modern study has indicated that these thongs were far from soft and were protection for the knuckles, not to soften the blow to the opponent, much like modern padded gloves, which protect the hand, allowing for harder punches. They can be found on many vases excavated from the fifth and sixth century BC.\nIn around 400 BC sphairai were introduced. The sphairai were very similar to himantes. The only notable difference was that they contained a padded interior when wrapped around the hands and the exterior of the thong was notably more rigid and hard. In addition, \"sharp thongs\" were introduced during this time period to facilitate greater damage and remained popular up until around 200 AD.\nSoon before the implementation of the sphairai, the \"oxys\" were introduced to boxing. They consisted of several thick leather bands encircling the hand, wrist, and forearm. A band of fleece was placed on the forearm to wipe away sweat. Leather braces extended up the forearm to give greater support when punching and the knuckles were reinforced with leather as well.\nKorykos were the equivalent to modern punching bags. They were used for practice in the Palaestra and were filled with sand, flour, or millet. They were commonly depicted in art depicting boxing of the time.\nRules and characteristics.\nThe currently accepted rules of ancient Greek boxing are based on historical references and images. Although there is some evidence of kicks in ancient Greek boxing, this is the subject of debate among scholars. Because of the few intact sources and references to the sport, the rules can only be inferred.\nUnlike modern boxing, the Greeks did not enclose the competitors in a ring to encourage fighting in close quarters. Therefore, most boxers fought defensively as opposed to offensively to encourage patience and caution. In addition, boxing in ancient Greece was not divided into individual rounds. Competitors fought until finish, usually by surrender or mutual exhaustion. Felled boxers could be attacked without consequence, just as if they were standing.\nWhile the practice of dividing boxers into weight classes is popular in the modern world, it was an unheard of practice for the Greeks. Typically, any man who wished to participate in the event was welcome to regardless of strength or muscle mass, and participants competed with each other through random drawings.\nThe precise rules of boxing in antiquity cannot be known for certain, and are thus inferred from historical references and images. It is believed that any type of blow with the hand was permitted, though using the hands to gouge at the eyeballs was not. Holding or wrestling one's opponent was also prohibited. If the fight lasted too long due to the tenacity of the competitors, the athletes could choose to hit each other in turn without either man defending themselves, to speed up the process of a knockout or surrender. Judges probably enforced the rules by beating the offenders with a switch or a whip.\nPugilatus.\nThe form of Boxing that was known in the Roman Empire was called pugilatus, from the Greek word for \"fist\" pugnus. This style was heavily influenced by Greek Boxing and was first learned by the Romans thanks to the Etruscans. It was a very popular sport until it was banned around 400 CE by Emperor Theodoric the Great because of its violence. Most of its evidence is present in ancient literature, sculpture, mosaic.\nThe two styles were mostly similar in terms of techniques and rulesets:\nThe following actions still counted as violations:\nThe main difference between them were the gloves used: instead of the oxys, the Romans used the so-called caestus, gloves made with metal knuckles, that required sheepskin reinforcement that wrapped all the way up the shoulder. There are also several depictions of caestii armed with spikes or blades.\nAnother main difference was the fighting position, in which the boxer stood upwards instead of bending himself.\nThe match ending was also changed, as tap outs weren't allowed in the beginning, but submissions were later added for safety measures.\nOne of the main reasons as to why Pugilatus was later banned was its brutality, as matches often ended with the death of one competitor. Boxers also suffered serious injuries, including bruises, concussions, brain damage, internal hemorrhages and broken bones."

Since then, he has also held coaching positions at Texas Christian University (1982, 1997), Iowa State University (1983–1986), Purdue University (1987–1990), Louisiana State University (1991–1994), a second stint at Texas A&amp;M (1995–1996), the University of Oklahoma (1998), and Kansas State University (1999–2001).\nDuring his first season at Kansas State, in 1999, he was nominated for National Assistant Coach of the Year. During his years as an assistant coach he has coached many stand out players and future NFL players, including Mark Simoneau Monty Beisel, Jerametrius Butler, Dyshod Carter, Lamar Chapman, Jarrod Cooper, Mario Fatafehi, Darren Howard, Ben Leber, Jon McGraw, Terry Pierce and Terence Newman.\nOn October 28, 2007, SMU athletic director Steve Orsini fired Bennett. Orsini notified Bennett that he would be dismissed after the Mustangs' last game on November 24, 2007 against the University of Memphis.\nUniversity of Pittsburgh head coach Dave Wannstedt named Bennett his defensive coordinator on February 4, 2008. After Wannstedt's resignation in December 2010, he announced on January 3, 2011 that he was declining to coach in the BBVA Compass Bowl. Bennett was promoted to interim head coach of the team and lead the Panthers to a 27–10 victory over Kentucky.\nOn January 7, 2011, it was announced that Phil Bennett would join the Baylor Bears as defensive coordinator, replacing Brian Norwood who accepted the position of associate head coach for Baylor.\nOn May 26, 2016, it was announced that Baylor was firing Art Briles as head coach. Bennett was a candidate to serve as interim head coach, but that position ultimately went to Jim Grobe.\nOn January 21, 2021, Bennett was named defensive coordinator and safeties coach for the North Texas Mean Green football team. \nPersonal.\nOn August 11, 1999, Bennett's 41-year-old wife, Nancy, was killed by lightning while she was jogging near their home in Manhattan, Kansas. The story of the Bennetts' relationship and the subsequent death of Nancy was the subject of a 1999 feature article in \"Sports Illustrated\", as well as \"College Gameday\" on December 6, 2014. \nBennett has a son, Sam, who is currently a Linebacker coach at Incarnate Word. He also has a daughter, Maddie, who followed in her mother's footsteps and became a nurse. Bennett married a long time friend Julie White Bennett in 2005 and has two stepdaughters; Katie and Megan."

        "text": "Scooter was an animated character used by Fox Sports during Major League Baseball games. The character, a baseball with human facial characteristics, is voiced by Tom Kenny (best known for his work as the voice of SpongeBob SquarePants) and was designed by Fox to explain different types of pitches with the education of children in mind.\nCritical reaction.\nScooter debuted in the 2004 baseball season on April 16, during a game between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox. While Fox Sports television chairman David Hill called Scooter \"really cute and really terrific,\" the character garnered few positive reactions otherwise, with \"Sports Illustrated\" writer John Donovan warning: \"purists everywhere, grab the barf bag,\" and \"Sports Illustrated\" media writer Richard Deitsch using Scooter as an example of \"how technology does not always help society.\" \"The Sporting News\" reported polling their staff with the question \"What best summarizes your feelings for Scooter, FOX's talking baseball?\", and 45% of respondents chose the answer \"Send him to a slow, painful death.\" Despite the negative reactions, Scooter would still be used in televised baseball games until after the 2006 World Series.\nPeter Puck comparisons.\nSome television historians have noticed the similarities between Scooter and Peter Puck, an animated hockey puck that was used by \"Hockey Night in Canada\" and \"NHL on NBC\" in the 1970s to explain the rules of hockey to viewers. However, Peter Puck was well loved by viewers and is often looked at with nostalgia, whereas Scooter has been met with little but derision."

        "title": "American Lacrosse League (1988)",
        "text": "The American Lacrosse League (\"ALL\") was a professional lacrosse league that played for one partial season in 1988. At the time it featured most of the best lacrosse players in the world who played some of the most exciting lacrosse games ever witnessed. It was founded by Terry Wallace and Bruce Meierdiercks, former teammates at Adelphi University. The league folded after five weeks of play.\nWallace and Meierdiercks tried to fashion the new league after the success of the Major Indoor Lacrosse League which commenced operations in 1987. Both leagues employed a \"single entity\" ownership model, instead of franchise being owned individually. The league owned all of the teams which helped to keep costs down.\nMeierdiercks in announcing the league's formation stated \"Terry and I were All Americans and we love lacrosse. We're not doing this for the money. We're financially sound and in a position to do this for two years.\" He continued \"then we plan to sell the franchises to the GM's - at least give them the first right of refusal. Then Terry and I will probably take over an expansion franchise in Philadelphia or Los Angeles or San Fransisco.\" Meierdiericks claimed at the time that he and Wallace invested $2 million of their own capital into the league by \"pre-paying\" expenses to give the infant league two years of financial runway.\nIn an attempt to distance the outdoor version from the pro wrestling atmosphere that permeated the MILL, in a \"shot across the MILL's bow\" the ALL leaders stated the games would be played in a family atmosphere with no alcoholic beverages sold, affordable ticket prices ($8 per game single tickets and $56 season tickets) and the players were to be \"drug tested.\" The ALL stated that with 2,500 paying fans per game, the league could break even the first year. The league introduced numerous rule changes to the sport designed to create more offense and excitement including a 25 second clearing clock and 3 long stick defenders on the filed maximum at any one time. \nThe ALL announced a 10-game cable TV package deal with the FNN/MSG (Madison Square Garden network), which reached at the time over 32 million television homes. As it turned out, no drug testing was ever performed on players or included in any of the player contracts. In addition, the concept of a \"family atmosphere\" was also a fiction as Denver Rifles co-Captain, Steve Bevelle, overheard the League owners instructing the referees in confidence prior to the first game in Boston to \"put away the whistles and let the men play.\" The clear inference was to let the games indeed turn into the WWE but with sticks and helmets.\nthumb]]\nThe League announced a 6-team league with each team playing 15 games. Teams were set in Boston, Baltimore, Syracuse, New Jersey, Long Island and Denver. The league attracted some of the greatest lacrosse players of the era including USA World team members and US Lacrosse Hall of Fame inductees such as Brook Sweet (University of Massachusetts), Brad Kotz (Syracuse University), Bill Bergan (Hobart College), Tim Schurr (Washington &amp; Lee University), Peter Scott (Johns Hopkins), Steve Beville (Washington College), Gerry Byrne (University of Massachusetts), Zack Colburn (UPenn), Todd Curry (Syracuse University), Michael Burnett (UNC), John Nostrant (Washington College), Kevin Martin (Hobart College), Dan Pratt (Syracuse University), Mark Burnham (Syracuse University), Travis Solomon (Syracuse University), Greg Tarbell (Syracuse University) and Tom Rosa (Hobart College) to name just some of the 138 players drafted and signed by the league (80% of the players were All-Americans in college). Baltimore attackman, US Lacrosse Hall of Fame inductee Brooks Sweet stated \"Every game is going to be like Hopkins vs. Hopkins. I was skeptical at first, but when I saw the caliber of players in the league, I was impressed.\"\nFor the most part, players were assigned to teams on a regional basis to increase fan loyalty stemming from their college experiences. The Syracuse team was made up of mostly Syracuse University and Hobart College players; The Boston team made up of University of Massachusetts and Brown University players; the Baltimore team consisted of Johns Hopkins, University of North Carolina and Loyola University athletes; the Denver Rifles had players hailing from The University of Colorado, Colorado State University and Colorado College etc. Players were signed to uniform two-year contracts that paid $4,800 the first year and $6,000 in 1989. At that same time the MILL (the indoor league) was still paying its players $100 per game. The first player officially signed by the league was Greg Fisk, an All-American Midfield hailing from the University of Massachusetts and signed to the Boston Militia.\nThe league was a forerunner in introducing new and improved rules for the sport of lacrosse, some of which are still in vogue today. The goal was to increase the pace of play, create more offense and make the games more exciting. These rules included such innovative ideas such as a 25-second shot clock, allowing only 3 long poles permitted on the field at any one time (the college rules allowed 5 at that time), unlimited on the fly substitutions (i.e. no horns like in college) and delayed penalties on fast Breaks.\nThe season.\nThe 1988 inaugural season of the ALL kicked off with three Sunday afternoon tilts on April 24, 1988. Syracuse traveled to Long Island and the turf at Hofstra University to play the Sachems (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEEdUOY2M4o&amp;t=356s), Denver flew into Boston to face the Militia at Tufts University and The Baltimore Tribe ventured up I-95 to square off with the New Jersey Arrows.\nThe quality of play on the field proved to be a pleasant surprise as the games were fast, exciting and played with unprecedented skill. The problem came with the attendance or lack of attendance. Only 600 paid fans attended the New Jersey game and the following week in the hot bed of lacrosse, Baltimore, only 500 fans attended the very exciting match. The Tribes second home game drew a smaller crowd of 300 fans. On the Other hand, Denver, proved to be a pleasant surprise as 2,7000 paying patrons attended the Rifles exciting overtime victory over New Jersey.\nBy May 19, teams had played four games. However, it as rapidly becoming apparent that the owners had grossly misstated the amount of capital they had invested. Balitmore player checks bounced and then their General Manager abruptly rescind. Games started being postponed and the Rifles suspended operations.\nAs the league floundered, a few of the Long Island players encouraged Wallace and Meierdiericks to meet them in person at the bank in Long Island to pay their salaries under threat of major slashing penalties and they did.\nThe most definitive piece written on the league was penned by Steve Holroyd in crossecheck.com/2019/03/17/american-lacrosse-league-1988/#_edn1 The American Lacrosse League.\nThe teams.\nThe Baltimore Tribe was an original six member of the American Lacrosse League, a short lived professional lacrosse league in 1988, that was based in Catonsville, Maryland. The Tribe played their home games at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. The original General Manager was Bob Griebe. Mark Glagola replaced Griebe, who resigned c. May 14, 1988. Frank Messanotte was the head coach. Brooks Sweet and Brian Wood played for the Tribe. Other players were Peter and Brent Voelkel, Chris Walker, Brad Kotz, Todd Curry and goalie Gavin Moag. The team colors were Carolina Blue and White. The Tribe had a 2–2 record when the league folded.\nBaltimore Tribe roster.\nThe general manager of the Tribe was Bob Griebe and the head coach was Frank Mezzandotte.\nThe Boston Militia was an outdoor lacrosse team in the short lived American Lacrosse League formed in 1988. The Militia played their home games at Ellis Oval on the campus of Tufts University. The general manager for the Militia was Chris Harvey and the head coach was David Hill. The Militia compiled a record of two wins and two losses before the American Lacrosse league ceased operation due to financial difficulties. Some of the Militia's notable players were Barry Fraser, Bruce Chanenchuk and goalie Dan O'Neill.\nBoston Militia roster.\nThe general manager of the Militia was Chris Harvey and the head coach was David Hill.\nSchedule and results.\nApril 24.\nGoals Boston Steve Glover 4, Barry Fraser 3, Steve Gistrelis 2, Todd Francis, Greg Canella, Bill Bergan, Tom Gagnon; Denver Sam Hovey 3, Peter Scott3, Chris Rossi 2, Jim Guthrie, Dave Traylor, Rick Parietti, Terry Claasen, Dave DiSciorio, Ray Stoughton.

Prior to 2005, there was a joint Gold Coast-Group 18 competition which fielded teams from both the Queensland and New South Wales sides of the border. With the Burleigh Bears joining the Queensland Cup in 1997 and the Tweed Heads Seagulls joining them in 2003, the combined competition started to lose some of its lustre.

Davidson did the damage in the first England innings and McKenzie in the second.

He finished with figures of 6-30, having taken 5–58 in the first innings.\nThe Fourth Test at Old Trafford proved decisive. It was won by Australia by 54 runs. The last day was very exciting, seeing many turns of fortune. England had managed a first innings lead of 177. Australia's second innings had reached 331–6 at the close of the fourth day, a lead of 154. On the final morning, David Allen took 3 wickets quickly, reducing Australia to 334–9, and the game seemed won. But Davidson then took the attack to the bowlers, hitting Allen for 20 in an over, and with help from McKenzie added 98 for the last wicket. England needed 256 to win at 67 runs an hour. Dexter, well supported by Subba Row, scored 76 in 84 minutes and took England to 150–1, and strong favourites to win. But Benaud went round the wicket and aimed at the bowlers' footmarks, and caused a collapse. He finished with 6-70, and Australia won with 20 minutes to spare, thereby retaining The Ashes. The final Test was drawn, after Australia had taken a big first innings lead.\nLeading batsmen.\nBill Lawry topped the averages with 2019 runs @ 61.18. Bill Alley, at the age of 42, scored most runs: 3019 @ 56.96. This is the most recent occasion on which a batsman has reached the 3000 mark and, with the subsequent reduction in the first-class programme, it is unlikely that the feat will ever be done again.\nLeading bowlers.\nJack Flavell topped the averages with 171 wickets @ 17.79"

The second match was played at the North Marine Road Ground, Scarborough from Saturday, 8 September to Tuesday, 11 September. The Players won by 7 wickets. Mike Smith captained the Gentlemen in this match and Trueman again led the Players.\nThe match at Scarborough was also the final edition of the fixture which began in 1806: from the start of the 1963 season, amateur status in first-class cricket was abolished. Thus, all players thenceforward had equal status as cricketers and were nominally professionals or \"Players\", with the \"Gentlemen\" ceasing to exist.\n\"ESPNcricinfo\" has a photograph of Fred Trueman leading out the Players XI for the start of the match at Lord's on 18 July.

The highlight of the season was a memorable Test series between England and West Indies which the tourists won 3–1. Yorkshire won their second consecutive championship title.

The tourists won 3–1 with one match drawn. The Lord's Test had one of the most exciting finishes ever and all four results were possible with two balls to be bowled: it ended as a draw with England five runs behind and their last pair batting. Colin Cowdrey had gone in as number 11 with a broken arm, but did not have to face a ball.\nAs a result of the great success of this series, England's future home Test programme was revised so that West Indies could return in 1966, much earlier than originally planned. This was done by introducing \"twin tours\", in which two countries would each play three Tests against England in the course of a season."

In response, Peter Burge, the last recognised batsman, went on the attack. He scored 160, well supported by Neil Hawke and Wally Grout, and the last three wickets added 211. 121 behind on first innings, England could not recover. Since a draw in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford would ensure that Australia would retain the Ashes, they batted on until they had reached 656–8 before declaring, with Bobby Simpson scoring 311, his first Test century.

        "title": "Ken Jones (rugby union, born 1921)",
        "text": "Kenneth Jeffrey Jones OBE (30 December 1921 – 18 April 2006) was a Welsh sprinter and record breaking Welsh international rugby union footballer. He played for both Wales and the British Isles. He is best known in Wales for his contribution to Welsh rugby, but most notably for his winning try against the All Blacks in 1953.\nEarly life.\nJones was born in Blaenavon, Monmouthshire on 30 December 1921 and as a youth attended West Monmouth Grammar School in Pontypool. There, under the guidance of Gilbert Garnett, he nurtured a skill in rugby union, representing his school and during the holidays he would play for Talywain. During the 1939–40 season, he was selected for the Welsh Secondary School XV, his first Welsh cap and later that year he attended St. Paul's Training College in Cheltenham. Jones served his country towards the end of World War II and was stationed in India with the Royal Air Force. It was while on service that Jones developed his sprinting.\nTrack and field career.\nJones was well known as a sprinter. Before he competed at the 1948 Summer Olympics he was already Welsh and Amateur Athletic Association champion and won the silver medal at the 1948 Olympics in the 4×100 metres relay, together with teammates Jack Archer, John Gregory and Alastair McCorquodale. In 1954 he ran in the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Vancouver and won a bronze medal in the 220 yard sprint. In the same year was given the honour of captaining the British team in the European Championships in Bern. It was at these championships that Jones was again part of a 100-metre relay, silver medal team. On this occasion the team comprised Jones, George Ellis, Kenneth Box and Brian Shenton, losing in the final to Hungary.\nClub rugby.\nAfter returning from the war, Jones looked for rugby clubs to join. During the end of the 1945–46 season Jones managed to play a few games for both Blaenavon and Pontypool, and when the 1946–47 season opened he applied for a trial for Newport at Rodney Parade and managed to get a place in the first XV. Jones spent the rest of his career with Newport, playing just one game for the Leicester Tigers during the 1948–49 season. Jones captained Newport over two seasons in 1950–51 and 1953–54. His captaincy during the 1950–51 season was particularly memorable when Newport won the Welsh Club Championship for the first time since 1922–23.\nWelsh international rugby career.\n1947–1950.\nJones was first capped for his country in an international game against England on 18 January 1947 under the captaincy of Haydn Tanner. The match was the first international for both countries since the start of the war, and unsurprisingly both sides were filled with new caps. Tanner and Howard Davies were the only players from Wales with any experience at this level, though Jones did have the benefit of starting with two of his Newport team mates, Reg Blackmore and George Parsons. Wales lost the game and although Blackmore and Parsons wouldn't represent their country again, Jones would play in all three remaining games of the championship. In the next game against Scotland, Jones repaid the selector's belief in him when he scored two tries. Wales ran out 22–8 winners, the highest scoring victory against Scotland since 1911.\n1949 was a poor year for Wales, and in that year's Championship, although scoring a try in the final game against France, Jones let his opposite wing in for the decisive score. That try relegated Wales to last place in the league and gave them the wooden spoon. The next season saw an incredible turn-around in Welsh fortunes which made Jones's world-class reputation. In the opening game of the Championship, Wales achieved a rare victory over England at Twickenham and in the next game against Scotland, Jones scored a try in another win. On 11 March at Ravenhill, Belfast Jones was again on the score sheet as Wales beat Ireland to win their eighth Triple Crown. Though celebrations were short lived when a day later, a plane carrying jubilant supporters back to Wales crashed at Llandow, killing eighty. It was therefore a somber occasion when Wales faced France on 25 March at the Cardiff Arms Park. The match itself was a walkover for Wales, with Jones scoring two of the four tries in a 21–0 score line. This was the first time Wales had won the Grand Slam since 1911.\n1951–1953.\nMuch was expected of the Welsh team in the 1951 season after the Grand Slam had been taken the year before, but the resulting championship was made up of mixed performances. Jones scored a try in an emphatic win against England in January, but found himself on the losing team when an unfancied Scotland beat Wales 19–0 at Murrayfield. After a draw against Ireland, Jones scored with a try against France in the last game of the season, but these was the only Welsh points in an 8–3 loss.\nThe next season saw a resurgent Wales, in which Jones scored against all three home nation teams. The opening game with England turned out to be the championship decider. While Lewis Jones was off the pitch receiving treatment for an injury, England took the numerical advantage scoring two tries through Albert Agar and Ted Woodward. In the second half the Welsh forwards dominated, especially in the line out, and in the resulting pressure Jones scored two tries, one converted by Malcolm Thomas, which gave Wales victory. The matches against Ireland and Scotland were won without Wales hitting their best form, and the final match against France was won despite the poor Welsh kicking. Jones had now collected his second Grand Slam trophy with Wales, and had played 25 consecutive games for his country.\nThe 1953 Five Nations Championship saw another good Welsh run, losing only to eventual champions England. Jones was again picked for all four games, but only managed a single try against Scotland. 1953 also saw the arrival in Wales of the touring New Zealand team. On 19 December, Wales and the All Blacks met at the Cardiff Arms Park with the New Zealand team so far unbeaten in the tour. Welsh hopes were raised after two New Zealand draws against Swansea and Ulster, and Wales were favourites to win the contest. The game did not start as was expected, and Wales were chasing the game after New Zealand took an early lead. In the last twenty minutes Wales appeared to raise their game and started playing offensive rugby. Gareth Griffiths returned to the field despite dislocating his shoulder and Clem Thomas moved back into the pack and the Welsh play became more focused. Gwyn Rowlands kicked a penalty to bring the scores level and with five minutes to go Clem Thomas made a dash down the left hand touchline. With his path cut off by the All Black defense, Thomas cross-kicked the ball for Jones to take it on the bounce. Jones rounded Ron Jarden on the inside and scored his most memorable and final try of his Welsh career. With Rowlands converting the score Wales had beaten New Zealand 13–8.\n1954–1957.\nJones was again one of the first-choice players in the 1954 Welsh squad, and in a repeat of the previous season Wales lost their opening fixture to England. A last minute try from Chris Winn gave England the victory, but not the Championship after Wales won the final three games of the tournament to lift the Five Nations trophy. Jones played in all four matches, but finished the campaign without a single score to his name, though he did receive the honour of captaining his country for his only time in the game against Scotland. The 1955 Five Nations Championship started on a more positive note for both Wales and Jones; Wales beat England in the opening game while Jones became Wales's most capped player in the same match, playing in his 36th appearance. Although Wales lost the next fixture against Scotland, they would beat Ireland and France to win the tournament for the fourth time in the last six years. Jones again played in all four games, taking him to 39 caps.\nThe 1956 Championship was a very tight competition with most matches decided by one or two scores. Wales, under the captaincy of Cliff Morgan, played excellent rugby, deserving of the title. Wales took the Championship title again, but on this occasion losing to Ireland to prevent a Welsh Grand Slam and Triple Crown. Jones again played all four games, and again failed to score a try in any of them, though in the last match of the campaign against France on 24 March, Jones won his 43rd cap. This made him the most capped player in world rugby, beating the record held by Ireland's George Stephenson. The next season, in the opening game against England, Wales ran out for the first time since rugby resumed in 1947 without Ken Jones. Jones was dropped by the selectors breaking his consecutive run of 43 matches. The next match, in a Welsh loss against Scotland, Jones played his very last international game for Wales. Jones was once quoted as saying, 'People ask me often which match I enjoyed most, the truth is I enjoyed them all. It was a marvellous experience playing for Wales.'\nInternational matches played for Wales.\nWales\nBritish Lions.\nThroughout his career, Jones suffered a lack of scoring opportunities, at club and international level. Even when alongside the likes of Welsh midfield star players such as Bleddyn Williams and Cliff Morgan, Jones scored very few tries for a wing of his class. This would change when Jones was selected to play in the 1950 tour of Australia and New Zealand. Selected for 17 of the games, including three of the four tests against New Zealand, Jones scored 17 tries and was chosen as one of the five Players of the Year for the tour.\nJones's greatest moment in the tour came in the Fourth Test against New Zealand. In this match Jones found himself playing against an equally fast track sprinter in the All Black's Peter Henderson. During the test, Jones found himself outside fellow Welsh international Lewis Jones, following a break from the Lions' 25 yard line. Henderson was running between the two Joneses, but with Bob Scott closing in on Lewis Jones, he threw a pass over Henderson's head which Ken Jones collected the ball skillfully at shoulder level. With 50 yards to the try line, and with four All Blacks giving chase, Jones showed his Olympic sprinting finesse to just keep ahead of his opponents to score a magnificent try. Unfortunately for Jones, although he scored one of the tries of his career, he found himself on the losing side. A fact made worse when in the last minute, with the Lions 11–8 down, Jones chased a kick head and looked to score a certain winning try when the ball turned away from him on the bounce, and the chance was lost.\nLater life and awards.\nJones was a high school teacher for most of his life. From 1948 to 1985, he was also a sports reporter for Welsh newspaper, the \"Sunday Express\", dealing mainly with rugby and athletics.\nIn the 1960 Queen's Birthday Honours he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), \"For services to Welsh Rugby Football\".\nJones has also been honoured by the sporting and journalist communities. In 1954 he was the inaugural winner of the BBC Wales Sports Personality of the Year and was also chosen as the first rugby union inductee into the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame in 1990, ahead of more well known players such as Gareth Edwards or J.P.R. Williams.\nIn his late years Jones served as a board member and president of the Newport rugby club, resigning in 1995 in protest of the introduction of professionalism to rugby. After a stroke, he was confined to a wheelchair. He died in 2006, at the age of 84."

        "title": "Goulburn Rugby Union",
        "text": "Goulburn Rugby Union Football Club is a rugby union club based in the city of Goulburn, New South Wales. It was a founding member of the Southern Rugby Union, the first country rugby club to be founded, and remains the oldest country club in Australia.\nThe beginning.\nThe Goulburn Rugby Club was initially formed in Goulburn on Monday 22 July 1872 at a meeting held at Payten's Commercial Hotel in Goulburn. The driving force behind the club's formation was Valentine Blomfield Riley, a Bowral born former Sydney University player and captain who had moved to Goulburn in 1872 to open a surveying company with his father. It was Riley who called the meeting to found the club, took on the position of secretary and then spread the gospel of rugby throughout the Southern Tablelands and Monaro regions through his travels in his role as a surveyor.\nGoulburn was the first country rugby club to be founded in Australia and remains the oldest country club in Australia to this day. In 1874 it joined Australia's original rugby body, the Southern Rugby Union, and teams from the various Sydney clubs frequently travelled to Goulburn to play or welcomed Goulburn as visitors to play them. In 1882, fleet-footed Goulburn winger Stuart H Belcher became the first ever country based player to play in the NSW side. His first match was against Queensland and he celebrated his selection with a try.\nLocal competition.\nBy 1893 Goulburn was itself a complete branch of the NSW Rugby Union (as the Southern Rugby Union had been known since 1892) and hosted a strong rugby competition of its own. In 1900, the Goulburn representative team, known as Central Southern Rugby Union, played the reigning Sydney premiers, the Glebe Dirty Reds and beat them by 26–6. While Goulburn pre-dates the Glebe club (later the Drummoyne Rugby Club), Goulburn would later adopt the Dirty Reds title as their own due to the maroon jumper they have worn since 1959.\nIn 1914 a rugby league exhibition match between Annandale and Western Suburbs was played in Goulburn and such was the interest that league clubs were set to form almost instantly. The issue was deemed so important that a town meeting was called with the mayor suggesting that the town could only support one of the rugby codes and should put all of its resources behind that code. Rugby league won although the first world war was to deprive Goulburn of both codes.\nRugby took a while to find its feet in all towns after the war and the same was true for Goulburn. There were several starts in the 1920s and 1930s, and by 1939 we had grown back into a Goulburn-based competition. The best players from that side played a Canberra rep side and beat them by 30–10 but then war came to knock us over again. Again, it took a while to get started after the war with a few more false starts but things were up and running again in the fifties.\nThe club was operating with limited success in 1952 and in 1953 there was again a Goulburn-based competition but midway through 1954 it folded again. In 1957 Goulburn was back in the ACT competition, and lost to Royals in the Canberra Cup grand final.\nCurrent incarnation.\nIn 1957, the Goulburn Rugby Union Football Club was officially reformed. It played with one side, then in 1959 two sides and in 1967 consisted of three grades. From 1957 until 1973 Goulburn played in the ACT competition. From 1974 until 1978 it competed in the now defunct Southern Tablelands Rugby competition, which was for the latter part of that period headquartered in Goulburn. From 1979 until 1982 Goulburn played in the Illawarra competition, before returning to the ACT from 1983 to 1985. In 1986 it was back to the Illawarra where Goulburn stayed until 1989, before finally moving to its current home, the Monaro Rugby competition.\nDespite numerous grand final appearances, premierships have been elusive. There were no premierships in the 50s and 60s but the club's most successful period wasn't far off. During the period Goulburn played in the Southern Tablelands competition they won four successive first grade premierships ('74, '75, '76, '77) with a handful of premierships in reserves and Colts at the same time. In 1981, the Reds won the Ilawarra reserve grade grand final against arch enemies Vikings and Goulburn's next piece of grand final silverware came its way in 1992 when third grade beat Canberra Uni.\nIn 2007 Goulburn finally climbed to the top of the mountain again with a first grade grand final win over Tuggeranong and a reserve grade victory over Royals, both at Poidevin Oval. First grade made it back to back titles in 2008 when they beat Cooma, also at Poidevin Oval and made it three in a row in 2009 with a last gasp win against ADFA. All three grand finals were under the coaching of Matt O'Rourke who had begun his association with the Goulburn club in 1986 as a player.\nIn 1996 the club officially christened and opened Poidevin Oval, the main ground at Goulburn Rugby Park that had been owned through Rugby Park Trust since the early '70s, and then in 2011 the club opened its new expanded clubhouse.\nGoulburn Rugby Union Football Club now operates teams across all ages and genders, starting with the Fizzy Reds competition (Under 6 – Under 12), the Tablelands Reds (Under 13 – Under 18), Dirty Reds (senior first and second grade teams), Fermented Reds (Over 35s) and Flirty Reds (women's team).\nRepresentative players.\nAmong Goulburn's greatest representative players are such names as Simon Poidevin, Peter Lucas, John Klem, John Langford, Geoff Richardson, Warwick Watkins, Bruce Bailey, Lars Hedberg, Ken Player, John Shiel, Vince Fester, Gordon Cabot, Paul Southwell, Garry Brims, and Bruce Blackley."

(Harry) England, who took what was considered to be a traditional view of cycling and opposed the reintroduction of massed racing on the roads as proposed by the British League of Racing Cyclists, led to the appearance in the 1950s of a rival weekly called \"The Bicycle\" and of a monthly entitled first \"Coureur\" and then \"Sporting Cyclist\". Both eventually merged with \"Cycling\".\nThe title has changed hands on several occasions. It was first published by the Dangerfield Printing Company (1891–1894), then Temple Press (1895–1964), Go Magazine (1964–1967) and Longacre Press (1967–1970) before being published by its next owner IPC Magazines (later known as TI Media) from 1970 to 2020.\nThe magazine's longest-lasting contribution to the sport was the creation on 4 April 1930 of the British Best All-Rounder (BBAR) competition for individual time triallists, establishing the rider the magazine considered the best against the clock by averaging competitors' speeds over 50 and 100 miles and 12 hours. It offered a trophy to the winner each year and a shield for the winning team.\nIn 1932 \"Cycling\" also introduced the \"Golden Book of Cycling\". Each page honoured a cycling hero. The first was Frank Southall, who had won that year's BBAR competition and signed his page before 7,000 cyclists attending the BBAR prize-giving at the Royal Albert Hall, London. The book has fallen out of fashion in recent years.\nEarly campaigns.\nThe magazine was aware from the start of the danger it perceived cyclists to be in from the growing number of cars and trams. The magazine did not care for insistence that cyclists display a back light, which it felt moved responsibility for avoiding an accident from the overtaking driver to the cyclist being overtaken. But it had other puzzles to consider, following the prosecution of a cyclist who had hung a Chinese lantern from his machine.\n\"Cycling\" campaigned against women's racing and refused to publish results and then, in the 1940s, stood out against the British League of Racing Cyclists in its campaign to reintroduce massed racing to open roads. It called the organisation's first race \"A hopeless revolt.\"\nThe modern magazine.\nLooking for more sales and advertisers in June 1957, \"Cycling\" introduced pages dedicated to mopeds and the magazine changed its name to \"Cycling &amp; Mopeds\". The move accelerated the decline in sales until, under the insistence of a new editor, Alan Gayfer, mopeds were abandoned and the magazine widened its outlook to all forms of racing on the road, on the track, to cyclo-cross and to cycle-touring. Among those taken on by Gayfer and who have remained in cycling journalism are the television commentator Phil Liggett and the author Les Woodland.\nAlan Gayfer left \"Cycling\" in 1969 to work for the United Press news agency on the other side of Fleet Street, London, where \"Cycling\" then had its offices. There he could also report his other love: boxing. He died of a heart attack while cycling in Canada after retirement. Gayfer was succeeded by Ken Evans, whose interest in short-distance time-trialling led to a parallel competition to the British Best All-Rounder: the Campagnolo Trophy for races over 25 miles (40 km). It lasted only two seasons before it was considered not worth the effort and expense. Evans resigned to work with the components wholesaler, Ron Kitching. Evans was replaced by Martin Ayres. He in turn was followed by Andrew Sutcliffe, who had been editor of \"Cycle Trader\". Under Sutcliffe the magazine took on a stronger pictorial content and reporting of domestic cycling, especially where it didn't concern racing, was lessened in favour of coverage of continental racing. Sutcliffe left to help form a company called Cabal Communications, run by other former IPC staff. Cabal introduced a monthly magazine called \"Procycling\" as a rival to IPC's own monthly publication, \"Cycle Sport\". Its first editor was William Fotheringham, who had also been on IPC's staff. Sutcliffe's replacement was Robert Garbutt, who was editor until 2015 when current editor Simon Richardson was promoted from deputy editor. Significant members of staff have included Sid Saltmarsh – deputy editor under Alan Gayfer – who worked formerly for the \"News Chronicle\" and the BBC and who was reporting the Tour de France when the English rider Tom Simpson died during the race in 1967. Recent columnists have included Tony Bell, and Michael Hutchinson.\nThe magazine has hosted the work of what are believed to be two of the longest-serving contributors in publishing history. Frank Patterson was an illustrator whose impeccable drawings first appeared in a November issue in 1893. His last illustration appeared in 1952. Patterson was known for his meticulous treatment of the bicycle, especially the elusive ellipses, and his ability to capture different species of trees. It was said a Patterson Oak could never be mistaken for an Elm. His pen of choice was a Gillott 303. Patterson's length of service was eventually beaten by cartoonist Johnny Helms who had a simple, but unmistakable style. His cartoons were a regular fixture of the magazine from 6 February 1946 until his death in November 2009 and perfectly captured the idiosyncrasies of British club life, especially time trialling, a cyclists domestic life and his infamous cyclist-hating dog.\nIn 2020, \"Cycling Weekly\" owner TI Media was acquired by Future plc, adding a title to Future's cycling division together with CyclingNews.com and former rival \"Procycling\" (which Future had reacquired from Immediate Media a year earlier after selling them in 2014). Procycling magazine was closed in early 2022.\nControversy.\nIn September 2017, Cycling Weekly were forced to apologize for a caption on an image in an edition of the magazine that read \"token attractive woman\" above an image of Hannah Noel, who is a female member of the Hinckley Cycling Race Club which is located in Leicester, England. The caption was noticed by fellow Hinckley Cycling member Carlos Fandango who tweeted it in a photo along with a request for an apology.\n\"\"So my cycling club made it into @cyclingweekly and this happened. I hope @cyclingweekly apologise. Still a lot of equality work to do it\".\"\nHannah took to Facebook and posted;\n\"\"I made it into Cycling Weekly, it seems not for my ability as a female cyclist but as a 'token attractive woman' – I'm absolutely gutted and disappointed in the magazine\",\" Noel wrote on Facebook (via the Telegraph).\"\"It's not really the reason I'd want to be in a magazine, it's sexist and derogatory to female cyclists.\"\nCycling Weekly editor Simon Richardson stated that the caption was an error and blamed a sub-editor for its inclusion. The apology read:\n\"Unfortunately during the magazine's production process a member of the sub-editing team decided to write an idiotic caption on a photo of one of the female members of the club\".\n\"The caption is neither funny nor representative of the way we feel or approach our work\"\".\n\"\"We would like to apologies unreservedly to the rider in the photograph. This appalling lack of judgement by an individual is just that, and not a reflection of the culture in the CW office\".\"\nFandango's tweet and Cycling Weekly's apology prompted hundreds of angry responses, many that blamed a culture of sexism within the sport."

It was established in 1966 and became a full member of FIBA in 1974.\nIt is responsible for representing Cyprus on the international stage and for running the national teams that represent Cyprus at all levels.\nCurrently it runs:\nHistory of Basketball in Cyprus.\nCyprus has a total population of around 800,000 most of whom follow the sport of basketball. In terms of popularity and spectator following, basketball only comes second to football.\nThe history of basketball in Cyprus can be roughly categorized into 3 periods (1966 to 1974, 1974 to 1988 and 1988 to today). Up to and including 1974 the most successful teams on the island were Digenis Morphou and PAEEK. As a direct result of the Turkish invasion both teams were expelled from their home towns; an event which had obvious catastrophic consequences.\nThe immediate aftermath of the invasion was a period of economic suffering for all aspects of society including sport and basketball itself. Investment in sport development, infrastructure and foreign expertise (players and coaches) became of secondary importance. However, the triumph of Greece in the Eurobasket 1987 tournament sparked a renewed interest in the sport which brought in young players and the beginnings of a much needed investment. Foreign players soon followed and new arenas were constructed to cover the thousands of fans flocking to the top division games.\nUntil the early 80's most games were held on open courts with a tarmac floor and a wooden backboard. But by the end of the decade KOA (Cyprus Sports Authority) had invested in several modern indoor arenas. Stadiums were erected in every city and venues such as the Eleftheria\" in Nicosia, “Kition” in Larnaca, AEL arena and Apollon stadium in Limassol now meet modern international standards where European competition matches are regularly held.\nExcept of the men's championship there is also a teenager's league (U-20). The teams that take part in the men's league also take part in the U-20 league. There is also women's championship with 6 teams, U-16 boys and girl's championship. Most of the teams also have basketball academies were young children go and learn the game.\nBasketball in Cyprus is an expanding sport. More and more people are coming close to the game and the interest form the press and fans is going rapidly. Basketball in Cyprus will be become more welcoming when the country will host the EuroBasket 2025.\nLeagues.\nCyprus Basketball Division A.\nTen teams have won the league so far:\nCups.\nCypriot Basketball Cup.\nEight teams have won the cup so far:\nCypriot Basketball Super Cup.\nNine teams have won the super cup so far:\nExternal links.\n• Basketball News Website in Cyprus - rebound.com.cy"

It was open to two categories of sports prototypes, SR and SRL, and awarded driver and team championships in each class. It began on 26 March 2000 and ended on 26 November 2000 after ten events were held in Europe, the United States of America, and South Africa.\nChristian Pescatori and David Terrien won the SR drivers' championship, while their JMB Giesse Team Ferrari squad won the teams' title for the third consecutive year.

However, after the initial announcement in 1999 Grand-Am opted instead to not include the European rounds in their championship as the majority of teams were not interested. World Cup teams also withdrew their support, eventually leading to the two races only counting toward the SRL category championship.

        "title": "History of archery",
        "text": "Archery, or the use of bow and arrows, was probably developed in Africa by the later Middle Stone Age (approx. 70,000 years ago). It is documented as part of warfare and hunting from the classical period (where it figures in the mythologies of many cultures) until the end of the 19th century, when it was made obsolete by the invention and spread of repeating firearms.\nArchers were a widespread if supplemental part of the military in the classical period, and bowmen fought on foot, in chariots or mounted on horses. Archery rose to prominence in Europe in the later medieval period, where victories such as the Battle of Agincourt cemented the longbow in military lore.\nArchery in both hunting and warfare was eventually replaced by firearms in Europe in the Late Middle Ages and early modern period. Firearms eventually diffused throughout Eurasia via the Gunpowder empires, gradually reducing the importance of archery in warfare throughout the world.\nArchery is still practiced today, for hunting and as a target sport.\nPrehistory.\nPaleolithic and Epipaleolithic.\nThe oldest known evidence of arrows comes from South African sites such as Sibudu Cave, where likely arrowheads have been found, dating from approximately 72,000–60,000 years ago, on some of which poisons may have been used.\nSmall stone points from the Grotte Mandrin in Southern France, used some 54,000 years ago, have damage from use that indicates their use as projectile weapons, and some are too small (less than 10mm across as the base) for any practical use other than as arrowheads. They are associated with possibly the first groups of modern humans to leave Africa.\nLikely arrowheads were reported in 2020 from Fa Hien Cave in Sri Lanka, dated to 48,000 years ago. \"Bow-and-arrow hunting at the Sri Lankan site likely focused on monkeys and smaller animals, such as squirrels... Remains of these creatures were found in the same sediment as the bone points.\"\nAt the site of Nataruk in Turkana County, Kenya, obsidian bladelets found embedded in a human skull and within the thoracic cavity of another human skeleton, suggest the use of stone-tipped arrows as weapons about 10,000 years ago.\nIn the Sahara, Mesolithic rock art of the Tassili plateau from 5,000 BP or earlier depicts people carrying bows.\nBased on indirect evidence, the bow seems also to have appeared or reappeared later in Eurasia around the Upper Paleolithic.\nIn the Levant, artifacts which may be arrow-shaft straighteners are known from the Natufian culture, (ca. 12,800–10,300 BP) onwards. The Khiamian and PPN A shouldered Khiam-points may well be arrowheads.\nPossible fragments of a bow found at Mannheim-Vogelstang have been dated to the Early Magdelenian age (c. 17,500 to 18,000 years ago) and at Stellmoor dated 11,000 years ago. Azilian points found in Grotte du Bichon, Switzerland, alongside the remains of both a bear and a hunter, with flint fragments found in the bear's third vertebra, suggest the use of arrows at 13,500 years ago.\nOther early indications of archery in Europe come from Stellmoor in the Ahrensburg valley north of Hamburg, Germany. They were associated with artifacts of the late Paleolithic (11,000–9,000BP). The arrows were made of pine and consisted of a mainshaft and a 15–20 centimetre (6–8 inches) long foreshaft with a flint point. They had shallow grooves on the base, indicating that they were shot from a bow.\nThe oldest definite bows known so far come from the Holmegaard swamp in Denmark. In the 1940s, two bows were found there, dated to about 8,000 BP. The Holmegaard bows are made of elm and have flat arms and a D-shaped midsection. The center section is biconvex. The complete bow is (5 ft) long. Bows of Holmegaard-type were in use until the Bronze Age; the convexity of the midsection has decreased with time.\nMesolithic pointed shafts have been found in England, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden. They were often rather long, up to (4 ft) and made of European hazel (\"Corylus avellana\"), wayfaring tree (\"Viburnum lantana\") and other small woody shoots. Some still have flint arrow-heads preserved; others have blunt wooden ends for hunting birds and small game. The ends show traces of fletching, which was fastened on with birch-tar.\nThe oldest depictions of combat, found in Iberian cave art of the Mesolithic, show battles between archers. \nA group of three archers encircled by a group of four is found in Cueva del Roure, Morella la Vella, Castellón, Valencia. A depiction of a larger battle (which may, however, date to the early Neolithic), in which eleven archers are attacked by seventeen running archers, is found in Les Dogue, Ares del Maestrat, Castellón, Valencia.\nAt Val del Charco del Agua Amarga, Alcañiz, Aragon, seven archers with plumes on their heads are fleeing a group of eight archers running in pursuit.\nArchery seems to have arrived in the Americas via Alaska, as early as 6000 BC, with the Arctic small tool tradition, about 2500 BC, spreading south into the temperate zones as early as 2000 BC, and was widely known among the indigenous peoples of North America from about 500 AD.\nNeolithic.\nThe oldest Neolithic bow known from Europe was found in anaerobic layers dating between 7,400 and 7,200 BP, the earliest layer of settlement at the lake settlement at La Draga, Banyoles, Girona, Spain. The intact specimen is short at , has a D-shaped cross-section, and is made of yew wood. Stone wrist-guards, interpreted as display versions of bracers, form a defining part of the Beaker culture and arrowheads are also commonly found in Beaker graves. European Neolithic fortifications, arrow-heads, injuries, and representations indicate that, in Neolithic and Early Bronze Age Europe, archery was a major form of interpersonal violence. For example, the Neolithic settlement at Carn Brea was occupied between around 3700 and 3400 BC; excavations found that every timber structure on the site had been burnt, and there was a concentration of arrow heads around a probable entrance to the enclosure, suggesting that these arrows may have been used by a large group of archers in an organized assault.\nBronze Age.\nChariot-borne archers became a defining feature of Middle Bronze Age warfare, from Europe to Eastern Asia and India. However, in the Middle Bronze Age, with the development of massed infantry tactics, and with the use of chariots for shock tactics or as prestigious command vehicles, archery seems to have lessened in importance in European warfare. In approximately the same period, with the Seima-Turbino Phenomenon and the spread of the Andronovo culture, mounted archery became a defining feature of Eurasian nomad cultures and a foundation of their military success, until the massed use of guns.\nAncient history.\nAncient civilizations, notably the Persians, Parthians, Egyptians, Nubians, Indians, Koreans, Chinese, and Japanese fielded large numbers of archers in their armies. Arrows were destructive against massed formations, and the use of archers often proved decisive. The Sanskrit term for archery, dhanurveda, came to refer to martial arts in general.\nNorth Africa.\nThe ancient Egyptian people took to archery as early as 5,000 years ago. It was widespread by the time of the earliest pharaohs and was practiced both for hunting and use in warfare. Legendary figures from the tombs of Thebes are depicted giving \"lessons in archery\". Some Egyptian deities are also connected to archery.\nThe \"Nine bows\" were a conventional representation of Egypt's external enemies. One of the oldest representations of the Nine bows is on the seated statue of Pharaoh Djoser (3rd Dynasty, 27th century BC).\nMany of the archers in service to Egypt were of Nubian extraction commonly referred to as Medjay, who go from a mercenary force during their initial service to Egypt in the Middle Kingdom to an elite paramilitary unit by the New Kingdom. So effective were the Nubians as archers that Nubia as a whole would be referred to Ta-Seti or land of the bow by the Ancient Egyptians.\nMesopotamia.\nThe Assyrians and Babylonians extensively used the bow and arrow for hunting and warfare. The empires in ancient Mesopotamia formed the first standing armies used exclusively for warfare. This included soldiers trained and employed as archers. The archers served as an integral division of the military that was used on foot and on chariots.\nThe Chariot warriors of the Kassites relied heavily on the bow. The Nuzi texts detail the bows and the number of arrows assigned to the chariot crew. Archery was essential to the role of the light horse-drawn chariot as a vehicle of warfare.\nThe Old Testament has multiple references to archery as a skill identified with the ancient Hebrews. Xenophon describes long bows used to great effect in Corduene.\nThree-bladed (trilobate) arrowheads have been found in the United Arab Emirates, dated to 100 BC-150 AD.\nEurasian Steppes.\nThe composite bow was first produced in the Eurasian Steppes during the Bronze Age, and from there it diffused throughout the Old World. The nomads from the Eurasian steppes are believed to play an integral part in introducing the composite bow to other civilizations, including Mesopotamia, Iran, India, East Asia, and Europe. There are arrowheads from the earliest chariot burials at Krivoye Lake, part of the Sintashta culture about 2100–1700 BC. These people are also believed to have invented spoke-wheeled chariots, and chariot archery became an integral component of the militaries of early Indo-Europeans.\nDomestication of horses and mounted horseback archery are also believed to have originated in the Eurasian steppes. This revolutionized warfare as well as the practice of archery.\nIndia.\nThe use of bow and arrow was recorded extensively throughout the history of the Indian subcontinent.\nThe paleolithic paintings of Bhimbetka rock shelters depict archery. Vedic hymns in the Rigveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda lay emphasis on the use of the bow and arrow. The second Veda, the Yajurveda contains Dhanurveda (dhanus \"bow\" and veda \"knowledge\"), which was an ancient treatise on the science of archery and its use in warfare. The existence of Dhanurveda or \"Science of Archery\" in antiquity is evident from references made in several works of ancient literature. The Viṣṇu Purāṇa refers it as one of the eighteen branches of knowledge taught, while the Mahābhārata mentions it as having sutras like other vedas. Śukranīti describes it as that 'upaveda of yajurveda' which has five arts or practical aspects. The Dhanurveda enumerates the rules of archery, and describes the uses of weapons and the training the army. Besides providing the account of the training of the archers, Vasiṣṭha's Dhanurveda describes the different types of bows and arrows, as well as the process of making them. Detailed accounts of training methodologies in early India considered to be an essential martial skill in early India.\nThe composite bow in India was being used by 2nd millennium BCE. The bow was used extensively on foot as well on chariots. It was incorporated into the standing armies of the Mahajanapadas, and used in mounted warfare on horses, camels, and elephants with a howdah. The importance of archery continued through antiquity during the Maurya Empire. The Arthashastra, a military treaties written by Chanakya during the Maurya Era, goes in depth on the importance and implementation of archery. It also mentions an archery school at Taxila which enrolled 103 princes from different kingdoms across the empire.\nDuring the era of the Gupta Empire mounted archery was largely supplanted by foot archers. This was in contrast to the nomadic armies on horseback from Central Asia such as the Iranian, Scythians, Parthians, Kushans, and Hunas. Later Indian kingdoms entities would maintain and field large numbers of mounted archers. The use of bows and arrows continued to be used as the mainstay of most Indian armies until the advent of firearms, introduced by Mongol gunpowder empires.\nGreco-Roman antiquity.\nThe people of Crete practiced archery and Cretan mercenary archers were in great demand. Crete was known for its unbroken tradition of archery.\nDuring the invasion of India by Alexander the Great, archers are listed among the troops Alexander personally commanded.\nThe early Romans had very few archers, if any. As their empire grew, they recruited auxiliary archers from other nations. Julius Caesar's armies in Gaul included Cretan archers, and Vercingetorix his enemy ordered \"all the archers, of whom there was a very great number in Gaul, to be collected\". By the 4th century, archers with powerful composite bows were a regular part of Roman armies throughout the empire. During the fall of the western empire, the Romans came under severe pressure from the highly skilled mounted archers belonging to the Hun invaders, and later Eastern Roman armies relied heavily on mounted archery.\nEast Asia.\nArchery featured prominently in ancient Chinese culture and philosophy Confucius himself was an archery teacher; and Lie Zi (a Daoist philosopher) was an avid archer. In China, crossbows were developed, and Han Dynasty writers attributed Chinese success in battles against nomad invaders to the massed use of crossbows, first definitely attested at the Battle of Ma-Ling in 341 BC. Because the cultures associated with Chinese society spanned a wide geography and time range, the techniques and equipment associated with Chinese archery are diverse.\nMedieval history.\nEurope.\nAt the start of the medieval period, shortbows were used for both hunting and warfare. Medieval shortbows were structurally similar to ancient bows, but new construction materials significantly increased their usefulness. With a range of about 100yds a shortbow had the ability to kill or injure an unarmoured man at close range, but were often ineffective against armour. Vikings made extensive use of shortbows both on land and at sea, but other early medieval armies less so, with some notable exceptions. Both sides used archers at the Battle of Hastings, and the Norman archers struck a decisive blow by firing their arrows into the air (avoiding shields and armour which they could not penetrate) and wounding Saxon King Harold. The shortbow remained the primary ranged weapon throughout early medieval Europe. Archers were usually unarmoured, and were typically peasants or townsmen rather than nobles or men-at-arms.\nAround the tenth century the crossbow was introduced in Europe. Crossbows generally had a longer range, greater accuracy and more penetration than the shortbow, but suffered from a much slower rate of fire. Unlike the longbow they did not require special skill or strength to use effectively. They were also controversial, attracting stigma to those who used them, and were outlawed by the Lateran Council of 1139. Despite this, crossbows were used in the early Crusades, with models having a range of and being able to penetrate armour or kill a horse. They fired short metal bolts rather than arrows. The French army relied substantially on the crossbow in late medieval times.\nThe longbow first appeared in Europe in the 13th century, although similar weapons were described in antiquity. It did not appear with any frequency until the 14th. Like their shortbow predecessors longbow archers were more likely to be peasants or yeomen than men-at-arms. The longbow had a similar range and penetration as the crossbow, but a much higher rate of fire. It also required more skill and strength to use effectively than a crossbow. Its lack of accuracy at long ranges made it a mass weapon rather than an individual one. During the late medieval period the English army famously relied on massed archers armed with the longbow. In the Scottish Highlands, archers were used in battle until 1689 at Killiekrankie, with a documented fatal shot from the Hanoverian Government army. They were last used in large numbers during the final clan battle between the MacDonalds and the Mackintoshes in 1688. Highlanders are most regularly recorded or depicted using the short recurve or \"McNaughton Bow\" in this period. Significant victories attributable to the longbow, such as the Battle of Crecy and Battle of Agincourt resulted in the English longbow becoming part of military lore. In both England and Scotland legislation was passed to ensure a supply of trained longbowmen, such as the Unlawful Games Act 1541 which prohibited \"Several new devised Games\" that might detract from archery training.\nThe Middle East.\nIn the Middle East the composite bow was the preferred bow in the later Medieval period. More powerful than the shortbow, they had the advantage over the longer longbow that they could be fired from horseback. However they also required skilled craftsmen to manufacture, and, like the longbow, extensive training to use well. The Byzantine Empire was already using mounted archers extensively by the 5th Century, and the Emperor Mavrikios laid down principles for their use in his seminal military work the Strategikon of Maurice. The core of the Byzantine army was the Cataphract, an armoured horse archer. The Byzantines also recruited mercenary light mounted archers from the Steppes.\nTurkish tribes, of which the Seljuk Turks are representative, used mounted archers against the European First Crusade, especially at the Battle of Dorylaeum (1097). Their archers were more lightly armoured than the Cataphracts, and consequently more mobile. Their tactic was to fire at the enemy infantry, and use their superior mobility to prevent the enemy from closing with them.\nAsia.\nThe Mongol armies of Genghis Khan and his successors relied almost exclusively on mounted warriors, who used the Mongol bow (a form of recurve composite bow) as their principal weapon. Mongol bows of that period were constructed from leather, horn, and wood with animal sinew outside, held together with fish glue and covered with tree bark to protect against water. 13th century bows were said to be able to shoot 700–800 meters accurately. Warriors would carry two bows, a long one for shooting at range and a short one for close fighting. They also carried different types of arrows for different uses, some of which could pierce thick armour. The bow was also used for hunting, and warriors were trained from an early age, and competed in tournaments.\nIn Korea Joseon adopted a military-service examination system from China that included a focus on archery skills and that contributed to the development of Korean archery as a practical martial art.\nIn Asia archery was one of the Six Noble Arts of the Zhou dynasty of China (1146–256 BC); archery skill was a virtue for Chinese emperors.\nThe Sasanian general Bahram Chobin has been credited with writing a manual of archery in the tenth century in Ibn al-Nadim's catalogue \"Kitab al-Fihrist\".\nA complete arrow of 75 cm (along with other fragments and arrow heads) dated back to 1283 AD, was discovered inside a cave situated in the Qadisha Valley, Lebanon.\nA treatise on Arab archery by Muḥammad ibn Abī Bakr, called Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya (1292AD-1350AD) comes from the 14th century.\nA treatise on Saracen archery was written in 1368. This was a didactic poem on archery dedicated to a Mameluke sultan by Ṭaibughā al-Ashrafī.\nA 14th-century treatise on Arab archery, \"Kitāb fī maʿrifat ʿilm ramy al-sihām\", was written by Hussain bin Abd al-Rahman.\nA treatise, \"A book on the excellence of the bow &amp; arrow\" of c. 1500 details the practices and techniques of archery among the Arabs of that time.\nAn anonymous book written in Picardy, France, in the late 15th century details how archery in medieval Europe was practiced. The book was titled \"Le Fachon de tirer l'arc a main\". It describes the means of how a yew bow could be made, the kinds of wood that could be used, how to shoot it, string it and different kind of arrows. According to the writer, its purpose is for posterity, possibly due to the rise of the gun.\nIn Mali, the footmen were dominated by archers. Three archers to one spearman was the general ratio of Malian formations in the 16th century. The archers generally opened battle, softening up the enemy for cavalry charges or the advance of the spearmen.\nDecline of archery.\nThe advent of firearms eventually rendered bows obsolete in warfare. Despite the high social status, ongoing utility, and widespread pleasure of archery, almost every culture that gained access to even early firearms used them widely, to the relative neglect of archery.\nIn Ireland, Geoffrey Keating (c. 1569 – c. 1644) mentions archery as having been practiced \"down to a recent period within our own memory.\"\nEarly firearms were inferior in rate of fire (a Tudor English author expects eight shots from the English longbow in the time needed for a \"ready shooter\" to give five from the musket), and François Bernier reports that well-trained mounted archers at the Battle of Samugarh in 1658 were \"shooting six times before a musketeer can fire twice\". Firearms were also very susceptible to wet weather. However, they had a longer effective range (up to 200 yards for the longbow, up to 600 yards for the musket), greater penetration, were extremely powerful compared to any previous man-portable missile weapon (16th century arquebuses and muskets had 1,300 to 3,000 joules per shot depending on size and powder load, as compared to 80-100 joules for a typical longbow arrow or 150-200 joules for a crossbow bolt), and were tactically superior in the common situation of soldiers shooting at each other from behind obstructions. They also penetrated steel armour without any need to develop special musculature. Armies equipped with guns could thus provide superior firepower, and highly trained archers became obsolete on the battlefield. The Battle of Cerignola in 1503 was won by Spain mainly by the use of matchlock firearms, marking the first time a major battle in Europe was won through the use of firearms.\nThe last regular unit armed with bows was the Archers' Company of the Honourable Artillery Company, ironically a part of the oldest regular unit in England to be armed with gunpowder weapons. The last recorded use of bows in battle in England seems to have been a skirmish at Bridgnorth; in October 1642, during the English Civil War, an impromptu militia, armed with bows, was effective against un-armoured musketmen. The last use of the bow in battle in Britain is said to have occurred at the Battle of Tippermuir in Scotland on 1 September 1644, when James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose's Royalist highlanders defeated an army of Scottish Covenanters. Among Montrose's army were bowmen.\nArchery continued in some areas that were subject to limitations on the ownership of arms, such as the Scottish Highlands during the repression that followed the decline of the Jacobite cause, and the Cherokees after the Trail of Tears. The Tokugawa shogunate severely limited the import and manufacture of guns, and encouraged traditional martial skills among the samurai; towards the end of the Satsuma Rebellion in 1877, some rebels fell back on the use of bows and arrows. Archery remained an important part of the military examinations until 1894 in Korea and 1904 in China.\nWithin the steppe of Eurasia, archery continued to play an important part in warfare, although now restricted to mounted archery. The Ottoman Empire still fielded auxiliary cavalry which was noted for its use of bows from horseback. This practice was continued by the Ottoman subject nations, despite the Empire itself being a proponent of early firearms. The practice declined after the Crimean Khanate was absorbed by Russia; however mounted archers remained in the Ottoman order of battle until the post-1826 reforms to the Ottoman Army. The art of traditional archery remained in minority use for sport and for hunting in Turkey up until the 1920s, but the knowledge of constructing composite bows fell out of use with the death of the last bowyer in the 1930s. The rest of the Middle East also lost the continuity of its archery tradition at this time.\nAn exception to this trend was the Comanche culture of North America, where mounted archery remained competitive with muzzle-loading guns. \"After... about 1800, most Comanches began to discard muskets and pistols and to rely on their older weapons.\" Repeating firearms, however, were superior in turn, and the Comanches adopted them when they could. Bows remained effective hunting weapons for skilled horse archers, used to some extent by all Native Americans on the Great Plains to hunt buffalo as long as there were buffalo to hunt. The last Comanche hunt was in 1878, and it failed for lack of buffalo, not lack of appropriate weapons.\nOngoing use of bows and arrows was maintained in isolated cultures with little or no contact with the outside world. The use of traditional archery in some African conflicts has been reported in the 21st century, and the Sentinelese still use bows as part of a lifestyle scarcely touched by outside contact. A remote group in Brazil, recently photographed from the air, aimed bows at the aeroplane. Bows and arrows saw considerable use in the 2007–2008 Kenyan crisis.\nRecreational revival.\nThe British initiated a major revival of archery as an upper-class pursuit from about 1780–1840.\nEarly recreational archery societies included the Finsbury Archers and the Kilwinning Papingo, established in 1688. The latter held competitions in which the archers had to dislodge a wooden parrot from the top of an abbey tower. The Company of Scottish Archers was formed in 1676 and is one of the oldest sporting bodies in the world. It remained a small and scattered pastime, however, until the late 18th century when it experienced a fashionable revival among the aristocracy. Sir Ashton Lever, an antiquarian and collector, formed the Toxophilite Society in London in 1781, with the patronage of George, the Prince of Wales.\nArchery societies were set up across the country, each with its own strict entry criteria and outlandish costumes. Recreational archery soon became extravagant social and ceremonial events for the nobility, complete with flags, music and 21 gun salutes for the competitors. The clubs were \"the drawing rooms of the great country houses placed outside\" and thus came to play an important role in the social networks of local elites. As well as its emphasis on display and status, the sport was notable for its popularity with females. Young women could not only compete in the contests but retain and show off their sexuality while doing so. Thus, archery came to act as a forum for introductions, flirtation and romance. It was often consciously styled in the manner of a Medieval tournament with titles and laurel wreaths being presented as a reward to the victor. General meetings were held from 1789, in which local lodges convened together to standardise the rules and ceremonies. Archery was also co-opted as a distinctively British tradition, dating back to the lore of Robin Hood and it served as a patriotic form of entertainment at a time of political tension in Europe. The societies were also elitist, and the new middle class bourgeoisie were excluded from the clubs due to their lack of social status.\nAfter the Napoleonic Wars, the sport became increasingly popular among all classes, and it was framed as a nostalgic reimagining of the preindustrial rural Britain. Particularly influential was Sir Walter Scott's 1819 novel, \"Ivanhoe\" that depicted the heroic character Locksley winning an archery tournament.\nA modern sport.\nThe 1840s saw the first attempts at turning the recreation into a modern sport. The first Grand National Archery Society meeting was held in York in 1844 and over the next decade the extravagant and festive practices of the past were gradually whittled away and the rules were standardised as the 'York Round' – a series of shoots at 60, 80, and 100 yards. Horace A. Ford helped to improve archery standards and pioneered new archery techniques. He won the Grand National 11 times in a row and published a highly influential guide to the sport in 1856.\nTowards the end of the 19th century, the sport experienced declining participation as alternative sports such as croquet and tennis became more popular among the middle class. By 1889, just 50 archery clubs were left in Britain, but it was still included as a sport at the 1900 Paris Olympics.\nIn the United States, primitive archery was revived in the early 20th century. The last of the Yahi Indian tribe, a native known as Ishi, came out of hiding in California in 1911. His doctor, Saxton Pope, learned many of Ishi's traditional archery skills, and popularized them. The Pope and Young Club, founded in 1961 and named in honor of Pope and his friend, Arthur Young, became one of North America's leading bowhunting and conservation organizations. Founded as a nonprofit scientific organization, the club was patterned after the prestigious Boone and Crockett Club and advocated responsible bowhunting by promoting quality, fair chase hunting, and sound conservation practices.\nIn Korea, the transformation of archery to a healthy pastime was led by Emperor Gojong, and is the basis of a popular modern sport. The Japanese continue to make and use their unique traditional equipment. Among the Cherokees, popular use of their traditional longbows never died out.\nIn China, at the beginning of the 21st century, there has been revival in interest among craftsmen looking to construct bows and arrows, as well as in practicing technique in the traditional Chinese style.\nIn modern times, mounted archery continues to be practiced as a popular competitive sport in modern Hungary and in some Asian countries but it is not recognized as an international competition. Archery is the national sport of the Kingdom of Bhutan.\nFrom the 1920s, professional engineers took an interest in archery, previously the exclusive field of traditional craft experts. They led the commercial development of new forms of bow including the modern recurve and compound bow. These modern forms are now dominant in modern Western archery; traditional bows are in a minority. In the 1980s, the skills of traditional archery were revived by American enthusiasts, and combined with the new scientific understanding. Much of this expertise is available in the \"Traditional Bowyer's Bibles\" (see Further reading). Modern game archery owes much of its success to Fred Bear, an American bow hunter and bow manufacturer."

        "title": "Target archery",
        "text": "Target archery is the most popular form of archery, in which members shoot at stationary circular targets at varying distances. All types of bow – longbow, barebow, recurve and compound – can be used. In Great Britain, imperial rounds, measured in yards, are still used for many tournaments and these have slightly different rules to metric (WA) rounds, which are used internationally. Archers are divided into seniors and juniors, with juniors being those under the age of 21.\nModern competitive target archery is governed by the World Archery Federation (abbreviated WA), formerly FITA – Fédération Internationale de Tir à l'Arc. WA is the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) recognized governing body for all of archery and Olympic rules are derived from the WA rules.\nCurrently 142 nations are represented by WA archery governing bodies. The largest of these are the FFTA (French archery federation) with approximately 60,000 members, FITARCO (Italian federation), DSB (German federation), AJAF (All-Japan Archery Federation), and the GNAS (Grand National Archery Society) of Great Britain, with approximately 30,000 members which has now re-branded itself as Archery GB. In the United States the WA affiliated governing body is USA Archery (National Archery Association of the United States), which dates to the 1870s, making it the third oldest archery governing body after GNAS and FITARCO, which date to the 1860s.\nRules.\nArchery competitions may be held indoors or outdoors. Indoor rounds are normally shot at one distance, whereas outdoor competitions normally consist of several distances. For lists of tournament rounds, see section entitled \"Tournament Rounds\".\nSince archery involves the use of potentially lethal equipment, much attention is paid to order and safety. Whistle commands are used to signal the different phases of shooting, or an 'end'. Two whistle blasts means archers can approach the shooting line. One whistle blast means archers can begin shooting. The archers are not allowed to collect their arrows whilst other archers are shooting. The signal to collect your arrows is three whistles from the field captain. These rules apply to all forms of target archery. Other rules, or points of etiquette, include:\nMetric Rounds (WA rules).\nFor a 1440 round, known until 2014 as 'FITA Round', outdoor distances range from for senior Gentlemen archers, and for Ladies. The juniors have shorter targets to shoot at. In Olympic archery, is the standard range. Indoor distances are either . \nCompetition is divided into \"ends\". An archer shoots either 3 or 6 arrows per end, depending on the type of round. After each end, the competitors walk to the target to score and retrieve their arrows. An indoor competition is usually 20 ends of 3 arrows.\nArchers have a set time limit in which to shoot their arrows. For indoor competition, under World Archery Federation rules this is 2 minutes for 3 arrows. Signalling devices such as lights and flags inform the archers when time is up. For a 1440 outdoor round the archer has 4 minutes to shoot 6 arrows at the two longer distances, and 2 minutes to shoot 3 arrows at the remaining two shorter distances.\nImperial Rounds (GNAS rules).\nFor Imperial rounds, the standard indoor distance is , with 5 dozen arrows being shot in a round known as a Portsmouth round. Outdoor distances range from to , for seniors, and to for juniors.\nCompetition is divided into \"ends\". An archer shoots either 3 arrows per end (indoors) or 6 arrows per end (outdoors). After each end, the competitors walk to the target to score and retrieve their arrows. An indoor Worcester round shoots in ends of 5 arrows.\nAt all record status tournaments, archers must adhere to the AGB dress code. The recognized dress is plain dark green and/or white, or 'club colours'. Club colours are unique to a club, and registered on the AGB shooting colour register. However, any colour garments may be worn with the exception of blue denim, olive drab and camouflage pattern.\nIn a tournament, awards are normally split into categories according to bowstyle, gender and, for juniors, age. All registered AGB archers also have an indoor and an outdoor classification, and classification awards may also be presented - this allows archers to only shoot against those of the same ability.\nClassifications.\nThe Grand National Archery Society runs two systems of classification: the main Classifications (for indoor and outdoor shooting) and Handicaps. To do this, they produce tables of scores for all recognised rounds and an archer's classification and handicap can be worked out from their scores, normally by a club's \"Record Officer\".\nClassifications are for a particular 12 month period with the Indoor Season running from July 1st to 30th June and the Outdoor Season running from 1st January to 31st December.\nScoring.\nStandard WA targets are marked with 10 evenly spaced concentric rings, which generally have score values from 1 through 10 assigned to them, except in outdoor Imperial rounds under AGB rules, where they have score values 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9. In addition, there is an inner 10 ring, sometimes called the X ring. This becomes the 10 ring at indoor compound competitions. Outdoors, it serves as a tiebreaker with the archer scoring the most X's winning. The number of hits may also be taken into account as another tiebreaker. In World Archery, targets are coloured as follows:\nThe inner ring is usually used for tie-breaking (the competitor closest to the X is the winner)\nArchers score each end by summing the scores for their arrows. An arrow just touching a scoring boundary line, known as a \"Line Breaker\" or \"Line Cutter\", is awarded the higher score. Values scored by each arrow are recorded on a score sheet and must be written in descending order (e.g. if an archer scores 5, 7, 6, 10, 9, 8, this must be recorded as 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5). During and before scoring no one is allowed to touch the arrows. This is so that if there is disputed arrow score then a judge may be called and the judge makes a ruling on how the arrow lies. The archer in charge of scoring on a target at a tournament is known as the \"Target Captain\" and in larger tournaments, they may be assisted by a \"Target Lieutenant\"; a Target Captain makes an initial judgment on all disputed arrows. Under WA rules, in major tournaments, after scoring, each hole is marked before arrows are retrieved. In the event of a \"pass through\" (the arrow passes straight through the target) or \"bouncer\" (arrow hits the target and bounces out), points may be awarded to an unmarked hole. Under AGB rules, and in some smaller tournaments, in the case of a \"bouncer\", the archer must step off the shooting line and hold their bow in the air. A judge then decides whether the archer is permitted to shoot a replacement arrow. If an archer accidentally shoots more arrows than allowed, the highest scoring arrow is not counted and a miss is recorded.\nrounds\nDifferent rounds and distances use different size target faces. Common sizes (and example rounds they are used in) are:\n faces are used in Olympic competition. A variant of the face, called a \"Spot\" may be used when shooting WA rounds. This variant shows only the inner 6 rings of a full face. There are also versions of the targets known as the \"3 Spot\". The targets contain 3 instances of the inner 5 rings of the faces arranged in a line or an equilateral triangle. This is to stop competitors from damaging their own arrows by shooting a \"robin hood\".\nTournament rounds.\nImperial rounds (measured in yards) are mainly shot in the United Kingdom. Metric rounds, also known as WA rounds, measured in metres, are used for most other tournaments. These are the main rounds that are able to be shot in target archery:\nGo down the first column of the relevant table until you get to the round you require. Go across this row to find out how many arrows you shoot at each distance (yds=yards, m=metres, doz.=dozen). An – means no arrows are shot at this distance.\nImperial rounds.\nThese rounds use 5-zone scoring, as opposed to the usual 10-zone scoring. The points are awarded as follows: 9 for a gold, 7 for a red, 5 for a blue, 3 for a black and 1 for a white. Arrows are shot at increasingly closer distances - for example, in a York round, an archer shoots six dozen at , followed by four dozen at , followed by two dozen at . Senior rounds are for archers aged 18 and over and junior rounds are for archers under the age of 18.\nMetric rounds.\nThese rounds use standard 10-zone scoring. For outdoor rounds, arrows are shot at increasingly closer distances - for example, in a Gents 1440 round, an archer shoots three dozen at , followed by three dozen at , then three dozen at , then three dozen at . The furthest two distances are shot on a face target; the nearer two on an face target.\n[Source for tournament rounds: Dave Pritchard and Phil Hale, \"Bowmen Of The Tors: Handbook For New Archers\" DRP Publications, 2001]\nOlympics.\nArchery was in the Olympics (and the 1906 Intercalated Games) between 1900, the second modern Olympics, and 1920. The sport was dropped from the program because there were no internationally recognized rules for the sport- each Olympics through 1920 held a different type of event. With the creation of FITA in the 1930s, set international rules were created. However, it was not until 1972 that Archery was re-introduced with the individual event, and in 1988 the team event was added to the program. Further competition rules changes were made for the 1992 Olympic Games, which introduced match play to the program in the form of the Archery Olympic Round.\nThe only type of bow allowed to be used at Olympic level is the recurve bow. Since the 1984 Games at Los Angeles, South Korea has dominated the women's event. At the Sydney 2000 games, the Korean women won bronze, silver and gold in the individual competition and won gold in the team event. They also won the gold team medal in the 2004 Athens games, the 2008 Beijing games, and the 2012 London games."

Surrey County Cricket Club, despite The Oval having been commandeered by the military, issued a statement that spring which \"hoped that some matches may be played in July and August\". It was a forlorn hope.\n1916.\nClub cricket in the south of England went into serious decline and many clubs closed down indefinitely. In the north, efforts were made to keep the leagues alive and the Bradford League did very well indeed, with large crowds reported, especially after the Saltaire club signed the great bowler Sydney Barnes.\n1917.\nPlum Warner, at home on sick leave, had an idea to stage services charity matches at Lord's. These would involve Dominions teams against English servicemen. Colin Blythe played in one shortly before he was killed.\nThe number of games increased as cricket began to be viewed as a morale booster. Birley records that \"as many as 119 services and schools games were played at Canterbury in 1917\".\nA Yorkshire County XII played two-day matches against teams representing the Bradford League and the Yorkshire Council league.\nWhen the 1918 \"Wisden\" was published, it honoured the \"School Bowlers of the Year\" - Harry Calder, John Firth, Clement Gibson, Gerard Rotherham and Greville Stevens.\n1918.\nThe charity and holiday games continued in 1918. This was a second successive warm summer and games were again well attended, especially league games with former county or Test professionals in action.\nThe 1919 \"Wisden\" honoured \"Five Public School Cricketers of the Year\" - Percy Adams, Percy Chapman, Adrian Gore, Lionel Hedges and Norman Partridge. Chapman went on to captain England."

        "text": "The Czech Republic national rugby league team was established to broaden the skills of the rugby union team. The team has competed in a number of competitions and hosted the Slavic Cup in 2006.\nHistory.\nThe Czech Association of Rugby League (CZARL) began life in early 2006, under the guidance of former Czech rugby union international Milan Mrtýnek and Englishman Iain Sellers.\nThe squad's first training session, in February 2006, was held in an indoor basketball hall because of an extremely fierce Czech winter. From these modest beginnings, the Czech Republic team, with support from the Rugby League European Federation, struggled to play four full games in their debut season.\nPerhaps inevitably, given the unfamiliarity of the game, the Czech Republic lost all four matches, and the margins of defeat were not narrow. The Czechs played their first two games against the touring British Student Pioneers team. A 29–2 loss in Prague was followed by a less encouraging 34–2 defeat in Olomouc.\nThis was followed by the first away trip to Rotterdam to face the Netherlands Tasman team, where the newcomers were narrowly defeated 34–28. In their final game of the season, also in Prague, the Czechs were beaten 36–28 by Serbia, in the inaugural \"Slavic Cup\" match between the two countries.\nIn 2007 The Czech Republic played in the European Shield tournament against the Germany and Serbia. This saw them travel to Belgrade to play Serbia and Germany travelled to Prague. Both games were lost. The Serbia game doubled again as a Slavic Cup match. In 2008 the Czech Republic team once again competed in the European Shield along with Italy and Germany, with a domestic competition in u16, u18 and Senior level.\nIn 2011, the Czech Rugby League Association was admitted to affiliate membership of the Rugby League European Federation after reforming its governance.\nCurrent squad.\nThe Czech Republic national team for the 2021 Men's Rugby League World Cup qualifying match against on June 16, 2018.\nNational team results.\nThe following is a summary of tournaments and results for the Czech Republic National Rugby League Team.\n2006.\nThe year 2006 saw the inaugural entrance of the Czech Republic Rugby League team. Playing two games against the Dutch team Netherlands Tasman. This was a close and competitive match against a team that is competing for a place in the 2008 Rugby League World Cup. The Czechs eventually going down by a converted try 34–28. Also in 2006 was the establishing of the annual Slavic Cup tournament, contested by the Czechs and Serbia. Serbia were the inaugural winners 38–26 in what was also a close match.\nOTHER\nSLAVIC CUP\nIn all, the first year of international competition for the Czechs was deemed a success.\n2007.\nIn 2007 the Czechs entered the European Shield tri-nations tournament. This was the successor to the central development tournament the previous year that had Germany, Austria and Estonia. The European Shield was part of a multi level (tier) structure of tournaments in which teams will be promoted and relegated. The Czechs had to face the Serbians and Germans in this year's tournament and were looking to get some revenge on the Serbian team from the previous year's loss. The Serbian game would also double as the Slavic Cup game.\nAlas this was not to be the Czech's year. Despite some fantastic play in offence in both games the battle hardened Serbians, who had just come off a World Cup campaign, and Germans proved a bit too strong. Still it showed that the seeds in the Czech Republic had taken hold and they will have a good core of young players to call upon in the coming years. The first game against the Germans was on home soil and Germany just having had a stinging loss to the Serbs were out to make amends and some valuable points. The Czechs after having a strong lead in the first half went into the half down by 6 points. In the second half the Germans experience came through and they ran away with the win 44–22. The next match was in Belgrade against the Serbians who showed why they were in World Cup contention. With an early try to the Czechs, the Serbians then muscled up in defence and moved the ball in attack to use their advantage. With the win secured the Serbians not only took away the European Shield but also the Slavic Cup.\nEUROPEAN SHIELD\nSLAVIC CUP\n2008.\nThe 2008 European Shield Tri Series once again featured the Czech Republic along with Germany and newcomers Italy. Last year's winners, Serbia, had been promoted into the European Med Cup with Lebanon and Russia.\nThe Czech Republic were looking to go two steps better this year, to get a maiden win in international competition and one over local international derby rivals Germany. With the advent of regular touring teams to Prague and Beroun and also a junior structure there was much confidence in the Czechs becoming a local force to be reckoned with this year and the coming years.\nEUROPEAN SHIELD\n2009.\nThe Czech Rugby League Association announced a 20-man squad and travelling party selected from four of the sides that competed in the inaugural domestic Championship to form a 'Czech President's XIII' to play a European Tour. The tour commenced with a game against Catalonia, then two European Shield matches against Germany at home in Olomouc on 4 July and in Padova against Italy a week later.\nThe first match took place at the Olympic Stadium in Barcelona as a curtain raiser to the engage Super League Round 17 clash between Catalans Dragons and Warrington Wolves, which attracted a crowd of 18,150. Over 3,000 watched the international at kick-off, and the crowd grew steadily through the game.\nThe first match of the 2009 European Shield was played between Germany and the Czech Republic in Olomouc. Before a home crowd, the Czech team came away with their first international win. They subsequently lost to eventual champions Italy, but the win over Germany was enough to earn second place in the tournament.\nEUROPEAN SHIELD\n2010.\nThe first match of the 2010 European Shield West was played between the Czech Republic and Serbia in Prague with a win for Serbia 4–56. In July, the CZRLA announced that Andrew Mulhall would be the new national team coach, before the friendly match that Czech Republic lost with Catalonia 16–66. The last match was against Germany in Hochspeyer with another loss.\nEUROPEAN SHIELD – West\n2011.\nIn 2011 the Czech Republic national rugby league team participated in the Rugby League European Bowl against Hungary. The tournament featured a one off fixture between the two nations on 23 July in Budapest, Hungary.\nTour matches.\nThere have been several touring sides that have been on development tours to the Czech Republic.\n2006\n2007\n2008"

        "text": "Kelvin Brian Martin (born May 14, 1965) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the fourth round of the 1987 NFL Draft. He won Super Bowl XXVII with the Cowboys against the Buffalo Bills, giving him his only Super Bowl title. He played college football for the Boston College Eagles before playing ten seasons in the NFL from 1987 to 1996 for the Cowboys, Seattle Seahawks, and Philadelphia Eagles.\nEarly years.\nAt Jean Ribault High School in 1982, he made first-team All-City and All-Conference, while leading all Jacksonville wide receivers in catches (47), yards (746) and touchdowns (7).\nMartin accepted a scholarship to play for Boston College, where he was a three-year starter and is recognized as one of the top wide receivers in school history.\nIn 1985, he was named as an All-East wide receiver, had a career-high 172 receiving yards against University of Pittsburgh, and was key contributor in Boston College’s Cotton Bowl win. He also caught the winning touchdown pass in the final seconds of Boston College 27-24 Hall of Fame Bowl victory over University of Georgia in 1986.\nAs a punt return specialist, he led the nation in yardage in 1985 (510). He set Boston College records for career returns (79 for 1,012 yards), single season yardage (510), single game yardage (166), and scored four touchdowns on punt runbacks.\nIn 2000, he was Inducted into the Boston College Varsity Club Athletic Hall of Fame. He still holds the career touchdown receptions record with 28, remains second in career yardage (2,337 yards) and fifth in receptions (133). Overall, he scored 194 career points.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys (first stint).\nMartin was drafted in the fourth round of the 1987 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys, after dropping because of concerns over his size and speed.\nHe was used mostly as a punt and kickoff returner as a rookie after missing the first 8 games with injury. Nicknamed \"K-Mart\", by his second season he was named the starter wide receiver alongside Michael Irvin and finished third on the team with 49 receptions. In 1989, he led the team in receptions (46) and receiving yards (644), even though he was placed on the injured reserve list on November 21, with a left knee interior cruciate ligament injury. The next year, he repeated as the team leader in receptions (64) and receiving yards (732).\nWith the arrival of Alvin Harper in 1991, he was limited to a third down role and as a punt returner, where he ranked third in the NFC with an 11.6 average. Against the Philadelphia Eagles, he returned a punt 85 yards for a game-winning touchdown in a 25–13 win and also set a franchise record with 124 total punt return yards in a game.\nMartin caught 32 passes for 359 yards and three touchdowns, while also finishing second in the NFL with a 12.7 punt return average during the 1992 Super Bowl championship season. His six-yard touchdown reception in the closing minutes of the NFC Championship game sealed a 30-20 Dallas victory over the favored San Francisco 49ers. He participated in Super Bowl XXVII and did not have any receptions in the game, but returned 3 punts for 35 yards and 4 kickoffs for 79 for a total of 114 yards, the same number of yards that Michael Irvin had with his 6 receptions in the game.\nAfter the season, the Cowboys couldn't resign him because of salary cap considerations, so he declared for free agency, leaving as the franchise all-time leader in punt-return yardage with 1,803 yards and the tenth leading receiver (212 receptions, 2,703 yards and 8 touchdowns).

        "title": "Tom O'Brien (American football)",
        "text": "Thomas P. O’Brien, Jr. (born October 5, 1948), is a former American football coach and player. He served as the head football coach at Boston College from 1997 to 2006 and North Carolina State University from 2007 to 2012, compiling a career college football coach record of 115 wins and 80 losses.\nEarly life and education.\nO'Brien was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. He played football and baseball at St. Xavier High School, from which he graduated in 1966. O'Brien earned an appointment to the United States Naval Academy, where he was a three-year starter at defensive end for the Midshipmen from 1968 to 1970. He graduated from the Naval Academy in 1971 with a bachelor of science degree in management.\nEarly career.\nAfter graduation, O'Brien served nine years in the Marines. During this time he began coaching as an assistant for Navy's plebe (freshman) team, then served at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, as well as tours of duty in California and Japan. O'Brien reached the rank of major in the Marine Corps Reserve.\nIn 1975, O'Brien returned to Navy and joined the staff of George Welsh, coaching tackles and tight ends. When Welsh became head coach at the University of Virginia in 1982, O'Brien joined his staff, where he remained for 15 years. During this period Virginia had 10 consecutive winning seasons and a share of two conference championships. O’Brien served as offensive coordinator in his final six seasons and consistently ran one of the top offenses in the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nHead coaching.\nBoston College.\nO'Brien became Boston College's 32nd head football coach on December 13, 1996. He took over a program coming off two straight losing seasons and reeling from a massive gambling scandal. O'Brien's first two Eagles teams responded with 4–7 records that included wins over Georgia Tech and West Virginia. He coached Mike Cloud to the BC all-time rushing record and first-team All-America honors. Cloud was a second-round draft pick of the Kansas City Chiefs while center Damien Woody was selected in the first round by the New England Patriots and offensive guard Doug Brzezinski was picked in the third round by the Philadelphia Eagles.\nIn 1999, three years of hard work paid off for O'Brien, his staff and players as they engineered the third-best turnaround in Division I college football. Led by Minnesota Vikings' first-round draft pick and All-American Chris Hovan, the Eagles registered three consecutive wins over Syracuse, West Virginia and Notre Dame to finish the regular season with an 8–3 record, a top 25 national ranking and a trip to the Insight.com Bowl - Boston College's first bowl appearance since 1994.\nThe 2000 Eagles posted a record of 7–5, including an impressive 31–17 win over Arizona State in the Aloha Bowl. Seven players earned All-Big East honors and offensive guard Paul Zukauskas earned first-team All-America honors. He was later chosen in the seventh round of the NFL draft by the Cleveland Browns.\nThe 2001 season was a satisfying one for O'Brien as the Eagles finished 8–4 and ranked in the top 25 in both major polls, capped by a 20–16 win over SEC powerhouse Georgia in the Music City Bowl. A 21–17 victory over Notre Dame gave the Eagles two wins in three years against their archrivals. Boston College gave eventual national champion Miami by far its biggest scare of the entire season at Alumni Stadium as the Hurricanes were able to pull out a victory only in the final seconds. Running back William Green rushed for 1,559 yards and was the second-leading rusher in the country and a consensus first-team All-America pick. Green (16th, Cleveland Browns) and offensive tackle Marc Colombo (29th, Chicago Bears) were selected in the first round of the NFL draft, the first time two BC players were picked in the first round.\nOver the next few years, the team posted respectable won-lost records and continued to win bowl games. In 2002, BC went 9–4 and won the Motor City Bowl, in 2003 they were 8–5 with a victory in the San Francisco Bowl and finished 9–3 in 2004 with a win in the Continental Tire Bowl. The year 2004 would be the Eagles final campaign in the Big East. They finished the season in a four-way tie atop the league and closed the season ranked #21 in both major polls.\nBC won eight straight postseason bowl games, the first six under O'Brien, between 2000 and 2008. BC ranked sixth nationally in Student-Athlete GPA for 2004–05.\nNC State.\nWhen O’Brien was named head coach in December 2006, he inherited a team that had gone 3–9 and lost its last seven games. In his first year, after opening the season 1–5, his team won four straight games, including a win over 18th-ranked Virginia and road wins at East Carolina and Miami. Despite the slow start, his first Wolfpack squad went into the season finale with a bowl bid on the line.\nIn 2008, O'Brien's team became the first in Atlantic Coast Conference history to start the season 0–4 in league play and finish 4–0. The bid to the Papajohns.com Bowl marked the ninth bowl invitation in the past 10 years for O'Brien. His freshman quarterback, future NCAA All-American and NFL star Russell Wilson, became the first rookie in the history of the Atlantic Coast Conference to be named first-team all-conference at his position and it marked the sixth time in his 19 years in the league that a quarterback under O'Brien's tutelage was named the All-ACC signal caller.\nIn 2009, his team posted wins over Pittsburgh of the Big East and a third straight win over North Carolina, but was decimated by injuries and finished the season 5–7.\nAfter being picked to finish fourth in the Atlantic Division in the preseason in 2010, the Wolfpack finished tied for second, was one game away from playing for an ACC title and was the third league team picked in the bowl selections. O'Brien's squad was the first Wolfpack team to garner nine wins since 2003 posted State’s first winning season in five years. With the Champs Sports Bowl victory over West Virginia, the 2010 squad tied the second highest win total in school history while finishing 9–4.\nIn 2011, after a brief stint in minor league baseball that caused him to miss spring practice, Russell Wilson transferred to Wisconsin for his final year of eligibility after O'Brien named Mike Glennon as his quarterback for the 2011 season. The Glennon-led Wolfpack finished the year with an 8–5 record.\nOn November 25, 2012, O'Brien received notice from NC State that he had been dismissed effective immediately after navigating the team to a 7–5 regular-season record. Athletic director Debbie Yow cited several reasons. She was concerned over lagging season-ticket sales, as well as his approach to recruiting. O'Brien's recruiting classes were frequently in the bottom half of the nation, and Yow wanted a coach who could bring top 25-type talent to Raleigh. NCSU was obligated to pay $1.2 million of non-state funds to O'Brien, as his contract ran through the 2015 season. However, NCSU ended up only having to pay O'Brien $200,000 after the buyout was renegotiated so he could become an assistant at Virginia. O'Brien announced he was retiring from coaching on January 6, 2015.\nBroadcasting career.\nAfter a brief retirement, O'Brien accepted an offer to become an \"ESPN College Football\" color analyst. In September 2017, O'Brien accepted an offer to become a color analyst for Navy Football Radio Network.\nPersonal.\nO'Brien is active in community outreach programs and serves on the board of directors for the Marine Corps' \"Toys for Tots.\" He was a major in the Marine Corps reserves.\nO'Brien also owns a vacation home in South Carolina, where he plans to spend his retirement after coaching. He is married to the former Jennifer Byrd of San Diego, who is on the national board of Rostro de Cristo. They are the parents of three children."

He became more involved in the offensive passing game, more than tripling his receptions from the year before and totaling 13 receptions for 102 yards.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers (1996).\nThis was Tony Dungy's first season as Head Coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

The host broadcaster was the BBC and the competition was sponsored by the cigarette company Embassy.\nTony David defeated Mervyn King six sets to four in the final. He was the first Australian to win the BDO world championship and the first non-European to do so since John Part. David defeated Ritchie Davies, Marko Pusa, Bob Taylor and the England captain Martin Adams en route to the final. King achieved a 170 checkout, the highest of the competition, in the third leg of the third set of his second round match against Mensur Suljović. The women's tournament was won by Trina Gulliver for the second consecutive year, defeating Mandy Solomons, Vicky Pruim and Francis Hoenselaar en route to victory.\nBackground.\nMen's tournament.\nThe British Darts Organisation (BDO) was formed in 1973 by the managing director Olly Croft; the BDO World Darts Championship was first held in 1978. It was one of two world championships in the game of darts: the other being the PDC World Darts Championship. The 2002 tournament was held between 5 and 13 January in Frimley Green, Surrey, England and was the first of 12 BDO-sanctioned events that year. It was the 25th anniversary edition of the tournament and featured a 32-player main draw played at the Lakeside Country Club.\nA total of 27 players automatically qualified for the main draw with the top 8 seeded according to their final position in the BDO rankings. The tournament's defending champion and world number one John Walton was seeded first and the second seed was Martin Adams, the England captain. The five qualifying places were decided via a play-off round at the Lakeside Country Club on 29 November 2001. John Ferrell, two-time finalist Bobby George, Markus Korhohen, Davy Richardson and Mensur Suljović were the five players from a worldwide field of 300 who progressed to the main draw by qualifying. The maximum number of sets played in a match increased from five in the first and second rounds to nine in the quarter and semi-finals, leading to the final which was played as best-of-11 sets. Sponsored by the cigarette brand Embassy, it had a total prize fund of £197,000 and was broadcast in the United Kingdom on the BBC and SBS6 in the Netherlands.\nThe media considered Walton and the fifth seed Raymond van Barneveld the favourites to win the championship. There was some controversy prior to the competition when six qualifying players -- 1996 champion Steve Beaton, two-time finalist Ronnie Baxter, Andy Jenkins, Chris Mason, Kevin Painter and Paul Williams -- opted to play in the rival Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) world championship instead. Olly Croft insisted the absent players would not be missed, but the head of BBC darts disagreed, stating: \"You can't just replace recognisable people with unknowns and say it is the same and that nothing has changed.\" This allowed Peter Johnstone, Wayne Jones, Stefan Nagy, Russell Stewart and Andree Welge to take their places.\nWomen's tournament.\nThe BDO confirmed in November 2001 the women's world championship would be held for a second time. The governing body expanded the tournament's roster from four players in 2001 to eight in 2002 after receiving positive feedback from its sponsors and the BBC. The tournament was staged between 5 and 12 January 2002. Four players automatically qualified for the main draw and were seeded according to their final position in the BDO rankings. The competition's defending champion Trina Gulliver was seeded first. Francis Hoenselaar was the second seed and Crissy Howat was seeded third. The final seed was Vicky Pruim. The remaining four places were decided via a play-off round held at the Lakeside Country Club on 30 November 2001. Stacy Bromberg, Sandra Greatbatch, Jan Robbins and Mandy Solomon were the quartet of players who advanced from qualifying to the main draw. All matches were played to the best-of-three sets.\nMen's tournament.\nFirst round.\nThe draw for the first round of the championship was made at the Lakeside Country Club by Leighton Rees, the 1978 world champion, and the women's world champion Trina Gulliver on 2 December 2001, on the day of the final of the 2001 World Masters. It was broadcast live on the BBC sport programme \"Sunday Grandstand\". The first round of the competition, in which 32 players participated, took place from 5 to 7 January and was held to the best-of-five sets.\nIn this round Walton whitewashed the four-time semi-finalist Andy Fordham 3–0. Walton led 1–0 before Fordham took a solitary leg in the second set. He then claimed the third set to eliminate Fordham in the first round for the first time in his eighth appearance in the tournament. The 1998 tournament semi-finalist Colin Monk overcame Tony O'Shea 3–2. Monk was two legs behind when he won three in a row to claim the first set. O'Shea won three consecutive legs for the second set and level the score before Monk won the third to go 2–1 ahead. O'Shea forced a final set decider that Monk won after O'Shea missed five attempts on a double ring. Gary Anderson won with scorelines of 3–1 in the first two sets against Nagy and whitewashed him 3–0 in the third set. Van Barneveld defeated George 3–1 to stop the latter from becoming the tournament's oldest winner aged 57. He began with a maximum en route to claiming the first and second sets. George had a failed attempt at a nine-dart finish in the third set. He recovered to claim the set after five legs. George led the fourth set before Van Barneveld won the match.\nEighth seed Wayne Mardle completed a 3–0 whitewash of Richardson 3–0 in the fifth leg of the third set. Welge and Erik Clarys tied 1–1 before the latter won a low-scoring third set. A 141 checkout from Welge elongated the match until Clarys hit the double eight and four rings to win 3–1. Vincent van der Voort led 1–0 over Suljović, who took sets two and three. Suljović attempted a nine-dart finish in set four until he missed the treble 17 ring. He then took the following two legs before Van Der Voort forced a final set decider that Suljović won for a 3–2 victory. Fourth seed Mervyn King defeated Stewart 3–1; King twisted his left knee as he retrieved his darts from the board after the first set. He played with a limp for the rest of the game and sought treatment afterwards. Korhohen, the youngest player in the competition's history at 18 years and 50 days, lost 3–1 to Steve Coote from scores of 3–1 and 3–2 in sets two and three.\nAdams compiled scores of 3–0 and 3–1 to lead 2–0 over Johnstone. He completed a 3–0 whitewash after defeating Johnstone 3–2 in the third set. Ted Hankey, the 2000 champion and seventh seed, defeated Jarkko Komula 3–2. Both players equalled the score and forced the game to enter a final set decider that Hankey won 3–0. Afterwards Komula said he was annoyed because he was not informed of tournament organisers moving the game's start time by two hours to allow it to be televised. Jones twice recovered from being one set behind Tony Eccles to win 3–2. Mike Veitch, who participated in the competition for the first time since the 1990 edition, was whitewashed 3–0 by Co Stompé after protracted play. Sixth seed Bob Taylor progressed to the second round for the first time since the 1994 championship with a 3–0 victory over Ferrell with a match-winning 102 checkout.\nTony David, who has the blood-clotting disorder haemophilia which prevents him from straightening his throwing arm, beat Ritchie Davies, the tournament's sole Welsh player, 3–1. Davies led 1–0 early on and David won the next three sets to enter the next round. The final first round match was played between third seed Marko Pusa and Matt Clark. Pusa took the first set 3–1 and won the second unchallenged. Clark claimed set three 3–0 before Pusa took the fourth set to complete a 3–1 victory.\nSecond round.\nThe second round was held from 8 to 9 January. Van Barneveld took 21 minutes to whitewash Clarys 3–0 and was the first player to reach the quarter-finals; he lost two legs to Clarys. Monk won 3–2 over Walton. His opponent claimed the first set before Monk secured the following two sets to lead 2–1. Walton drew level with Monk 2–2 after his opponent missed the double 18 ring in the fourth set's final leg. This caused the match to conclude with a final set decider, which Monk won 3–2 to progress to the second round after a 116 checkout and a double 10 finish. Walton said afterwards he was uncertain whether the strain of attempting to win the tournament for a second time or a minor repetitive strain injury on his wrists contributed to his loss against Monk.\nNagy won the first set against Mardle. It appeared he would take the second when the score was 2–2 before Mardle equalled the scoreline. Mardle subsequently entered the quarter-finals with a 3–1 victory. King compiled the tournament's maximum checkout of 170 in the third leg of the third set of his match between Suljović and a 161 finish. Suljović won the first set before King won three in a row to secure a 3–1 victory. Hankey won the first two sets without a challenge from Jones, who took sets three and four from checkouts of 121 and 80. Hankey commenced the final set with a maximum score in the first leg before Jones took the following three legs to win by 3–2.\nThe second round's sixth match was contested by Taylor and Stompé. Taylor won the first set 3–2. He then missed achieving a 138 checkout and allowed Stompé to complete a 135 checkout and tie at 1–1. Three maximum scores and a dart landing in the double 10 ring put Taylor ahead. He took the fourth set to win 3–1. Adams lost the first set to Coote before he secured the next two with scores of 3–1. Both players levelled the score at 2–2 in the fourth set before Adams attained his only maximum score of the game to win 3–1. In the final match of the second round David played Pusa. David used Pusa's low scoring performance to win the first two sets. Pusa claimed the third set 3–2 and was unable to replicate this performance; David won all three legs of the third set for a 3–1 victory.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe four quarter-finals were played to the best-of-nine sets between 10 and 11 January. Monk, who treated his match against Mardle as the final, won 5–4 in a closely contested game. Monk took a 4–1 lead before Mardle replied by winning twelve consecutive legs to level the score at 4–4 and required the game to conclude with a ninth set. Monk took the deciding frame to enter the semi-finals, saying afterwards, \"At 4–1 I was thinking it was happy days, but next thing I had the world on my shoulders. My arm was shaking and my knees rattling – I was worn out.\" Later that day, in a match that saw 27 maximum scores, King led Van Barneveld 2–0 with scores of 3–1 in the first two sets. Van Barneveld took the third set 3–1; a 160 checkout and a maximum score put King 3–1 in front. He compiled a 156 checkout before King won the fifth set. After a dart thrown by Van Barneveld missed the bullseye ring in an attempt to achieve a 170 checkout, he took the following two sets. Before Van Barneveld could force a final set decider King completed a 131 checkout to win 5–3.\nAdams defeated Jones 5–1 to reach the semi-finals of the tournament for the first time since the 1995 edition. He moved 2–0 in front, which included a 121 checkout. Jones claimed the third set to be one set behind. Adams restored his lead by another two sets. During set six Jones threw four darts at striking a double ring while 2–1 behind Adams to which his opponent responded with a double top finish to complete a victory. Against Taylor, David went 2–0 behind until he won the match's third set with a finish on the double 16 ring. He lost a closely contested fifth and sixth sets to Taylor before David forced a final set decider with victories in the next two sets. The final set went to a fourth leg after Taylor could not complete checkouts of 116 and 125. David claimed a 5–4 win with a finish on the double ten ring on his final dart throw. David's victory allowed him to become the first Australian to reach the semi-finals of the BDO world championship.\nSemi-finals.\nBoth of the semi-finals were played on 12 January. The first semi-final was played between King and Monk. Both players had been at this stage of the event before; King was defeated 5–3 by Les Wallace in the 1997 tournament and Monk lost to Van Barneveld in the 1998 competition. King won a tightly-contested first set after he could not complete a 170 checkout. Monk subsequently defeated King 3–2 in the following set. King made checkouts of 116 and 153 to lead 3–1 at the mid-session interval. A 121 checkout and two maximum scores from King increased his lead over Monk to 4–1. He then achieved another maximum score and hit the double four ring to win 5–1 and become the first player to earn a berth in the final.\nThe second semi-final was held between Adams and David. Adams took the opening set 3–0 and David commenced the second set by winning its first leg. Adams equalled the second set 2–2 by David hit the double ten leg on his second attempt to claim the set. David won the following three sets to go 4–1 ahead and put himself requiring another set to enter the final. Afterwards, Adams clinched three consecutive legs to win set six. He then compiled checkouts of 158 and 121 to equal the score at 4–4 and end the match with a ninth set. David led the final set 2–1 before Adams forced a final leg decider. David won two legs on a tie-break and struck the double 20 ring after Adams missed two opportunities to hit the double 16 ring to claim a 5–4 victory and progress to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final played between David and King on 13 January was held to the best-of-11 sets. During the match, which took place before a crowd of 1,200 spectators, an 81 checkout and a 12-dart finish won David the first set 3–2 after King's dart did not strike the double 20 ring in leg four. King took the second set 3–1 when David missed three dart throws to the double 10 ring. David responded to claim the following four sets to put himself within a solitary set of claiming the championship. The next three sets were claimed by King with a checkout of 161 and respective finishes on the double four and double eight rings; David had missed three chances of finishing the match early after nine sets on the double 20 ring. During the tenth set both players equalled the scoreline before David successfully threw a dart on the double 18 ring to hold a 2–1 advantage. After King was unable to attain scoring opportunities David hit the single 20 section, and missed his first attempt to hit the double 10 ring when a dart landed outside the board. He hit the double 10 ring on the second attempt to win the match 6–4 and the tournament.\nDavid became the first Australian to win the BDO world championship, and the first non-European player to do so since Canadian, John Part. He won £48,000 for his success, saying, \"It was unbelievable. When I was younger I had a dream. I dreamt that I would win three competitions. The first was the Townsville Open, which I won a few days later. The second was the Australian Open in Geelong, which took me two or three years. And the last was the Embassy World Professional championship. And now I've done it.\" King said David deserved to win the tournament, \"Believe me, this man is a very, very worthy champ\", and added, \"He just bashed me up.\"\nThe press reviewed the match positively and David was called \"The People's Champion\" in a similar fashion to Alex Higgins in snooker. Jon Wilde of \"The Independent\" and \"The Guardian\"'s Ian Malin noted David had become \"one of the game's most unlikely heroes\" by winning the tournament due to his blood-clotting disorder that caused him to spend a majority of his early years hospitalised and doctors told his parents it was unlikely he would reach his teenage years. Bruce Wilson writing for the \"Herald Sun\" called David's victory \"a true Cinderella story\" because he was ranked 18th in the world and considered a 66–1 outsider. Bobby George, writing in his BBC Sport online column, agreed David deserved to win and criticised King's performance in the final.\nWomen's tournament.\nAll four of the quarter-finals of the women's tournament took place on 5 January and ended in 2–0 whitewashes. In a rematch of the 2001 final, tournament favourite Gulliver played Solomons. Gulliver won all of the match's legs to become the first player through to the semi-finals. Pruim overcame a challenge from Robbins in the second quarter-final match. World number two Hoenselaar averaged 26.14 points per dart and accurately threw darts on the double rings en route to defeating Bromberg. The final quarter-final saw Greatbatch defeat 2001 semi-finalist Howat after overcoming a challenge from her opponent to equal the score at 2–2 in the second set.\nIn the semi-finals, held between 10 and 11 January, Gulliver defeated Pruim 2–1. Pruim won the match's first three legs to take a 1–0 lead. Gulliver then won the second set and equalled the final set decider 2–2 by throwing darts on the single 20 and double 20 rings before winning the match to enter the final. The other semi-final saw Hoenselaar overhaul Greatbatch 2–1. Hoenselaar was unchallenged early on and claimed the first set. Hoenselaar threw 35 darts to claim the victory as Greatbatch could not initiate a response.\nThe final was played between Gulliver and Hoenselaar on 12 January. Hoenselaar began with a first set victory of 3–1 before Gulliver claimed the second set by the same scoreline. Both players equalled the third set's score 2–2. The final leg of the concluding set saw Hoenselaar take an early lead; she had to score 130 points and Gulliver 114 points. Gulliver compiled 60 points and finished on the double 20 ring to win the second BDO women's world championship. After the match, Gulliver said, \"I'm over the moon. To win it once and go back and successfully defend it is beyond my wildest dreams. It was hard this time and there was an extra round, with eight players starting instead of the four last year\", and, \"Everyone wants the title and with me being the number one seed and defending champion there was a lot of pressure.\"\nPrize fund.\nThe breakdown of prize money for 2002 is shown below.\nMen's tournament\nWomen's tournament\nDraw.\nMen's draw.\nNumbers given to the left of players' names show the seedings for the top eight players in the men's tournament.

        "text": "The 2003 BDO World Darts Championship was a professional darts tournament held from 4 to 12 January 2003 at the Lakeside Country Club in Frimley Green, Surrey. It was the 26th staging of the competition since the 1978 edition and the 18th time it took place at the Lakeside Country Club. The competition was the first of 14 British Darts Organisation (BDO) tournaments in 2003 and featured a women's world championship for the third time. It was broadcast by the BBC in the United Kingdom and was sponsored by the cigarette company Embassy.\nTwo-time world champion Raymond van Barneveld defeated Ritchie Davies six sets to three (6–3) in the final. He joined Eric Bristow and John Lowe as the third player to win three or more BDO world titles in their career. Van Barneveld defeated Matt Clark, John Burton, Erik Clarys and Mervyn King en route to the final. Clarys achieved a 170 checkout, the highest of the tournament, in the final set of his quarter-final round match against Van Barneveld. The women's championship was won by Trina Gulliver for the third consecutive year, defeating Dawn Standley, Mieke de Boer and Anne Kirk en route to victory.\nAs Canadian John Part won the rival PDC World Darts Championship the same year, this was the first time that both versions of the world title were held by a player from outside the British Isles.\nBackground.\nMen's tournament.\nThe British Darts Organisation (BDO) was formed in 1973 by the managing director Olly Croft; the BDO World Darts Championship was first held in 1978. It was one of two world championships in the game of darts: the other being the PDC World Darts Championship. The 2003 tournament was held between 4 and 12 January, in Frimley Green, Surrey, and was the first of 14 BDO-sanctioned events that year. It was the 26th edition of the tournament and featured a 32-player main draw played at the Lakeside Country Club.\nA total of 27 players automatically qualified for the main draw with the top 8 seeded according to their final position in the BDO rankings. The tournament's defending champion and world number one Tony David was seeded first and Raymond van Barneveld was seeded second. The remaining five places were decided by an international play-off round held at Bridlington Spa, Bridlington, on 31 October 2002. John Burton, Dennis Harbour. Martin Phillips, Brian Sorensen and Robert Wagner were the five players who progressed from qualifying to the main draw. The maximum number of sets in a match increased from five in the first and second rounds to nine in the quarter- and semi-finals, leading up to the final which was played as best-of-11 frames. Sponsored by the cigarette brand Embassy, it had a total prize fund of £205,000, and was broadcast in the United Kingdom on the BBC.\nIn the lead up to the 2002 BDO world championship, David was seen by \"The Times\" correspondent Mel Webb as the favourite to retain his title due to his performances during the 2002 season. Conversely, \"The Racing Post\" Steve Davies reported bookmakers considered Van Barneveld the most likely player to win the tournament, which would be his third BDO world championship victory. Embassy Darts guest writer Marcus Stead opined the progress of John Walton, the 2001 champion, would be observed carefully.\nWomen's tournament.\nThe BDO women's world championship was the third edition of the tournament, and took place from 4 to 11 January, at the Lakeside Country Club, Frimley Green, Surrey. A total of four players automatically qualified for the main draw and were seeded according to their final position in the BDO rankings. Francis Hoenselaar was seeded first and the competition's defending champion Trina Gulliver was the second seed. Mieke de Boer was seeded third and the final seed was Anne Kirk. Karin Krappen was the only automatic non-seeded participant. The remaining three places were decided by an international play-off round held at Bridlington Spa, Bridlington on 31 October 2002. Linda Rogers-Pickett, Dawn Standley and Gaynor Williams were the trio who advanced from qualifying to the main draw. All matches were played to the best-of-three sets.\nMen's tournament.\nFirst round.\nThe draw for the first round of the championship was conducted by Peter Ebdon, the 2002 world snooker champion, and the two-time women's world darts champion Trina Gulliver at Bridlington Spa on 3 November 2002. It was televised live on the BBC sport programme \"Sunday Grandstand\". The first round of the competition, in which 32 players participated, took place from 4 to 6 January and was held as best-of-five sets.\nIn this round Vincent van der Voort defeated Jarkko Komula 3–1. Komula moved 2–0 ahead in the first set until Van Der Voort produced an 11-dart finish to win set one. Van Der Voort won the game with a 117 checkout. David, who has the blood-clotting disorder haemophilia, lost the first set in his match against Sorensen due to several darts landing outside the board's targets before taking three sets in a row in a 3–1 victory. Against Phillips, Walton claimed set one before Phillips took six successive legs to lead 2–1. Two double one ring finishes gave Walton the fourth set and took the fifth to win 3–2. Walton said he had received treatment for a trapped nerve in his neck before the match. Ritchie Davies, in his seventh consecutive BDO World Championship appearance, defeated Albertino Essers 3–1, a match which saw Davies claim the opening set unchallenged. Gary Anderson defeated Peter Johnstone 3–2 after he converted a 2–0 deficit to win the first set 3–2. Both players twice equalled the game before Anderson took three legs in a row to win. Four-time semi-finalist Andy Fordham compiled high scores and struck the double rings to whitewash Stefan Nagy 3–0.\nBob Taylor progressed past the first round for the second year in a row with a 3–0 whitewash of Peter Hunt from set victories of 3–2 and 3–1×2. In their maiden television appearances, Darryl Fitton defeated Burton 3–1 with set victories of 3–0, 3–2 and 3–1. Martin Adams, the number four seed and England captain, claimed the opening set against Co Stompé. He beat Stompé in the second set and won 3–1 with a 138 checkout. Wagner won the opening set against Gary Robson 3–2. Robson took set two after Wagner missed multiple chances to hit the double ten ring. Wagner took two more sets from six consecutive legs for a 3–1 victory. In the match between Van Barneveld and Matt Clark, the latter began with a maximum before the former took the first set. He then claimed six legs in a row to win 3–1. Erik Clarys defeated the seventh seed Tony Eccles 3–1 after a minor challenge from Eccles in set three. Sub-par play from Shaun Greatbatch saw him whitewashed 3–0 by Colin Monk; Greatbatch was able to force the second set to conclude with a final leg decider before he missed the double rings in the following set.\nSixth seed Tony O'Shea beat Ted Hankey, the 2000 champion, 3–2 in a closely contested match. Hankey won the first set unchallenged before a 118 checkout gave O'Shea the next set. The score was level until O'Shea defeated Hankey on the double 16 ring. Harbour defeated teenager James Wade 3–2. Coming from 2–1 behind Harbour produced checkouts of 145, 115 and 60 in the fifth set to go through to the next round after Wade was unable to convert ten opportunities to win the match. The final first round match was played between the number three seed Mervyn King and Steve Coote. After King compiled a 138 checkout, Coote won the first set 3–2 on a 101 checkout. King moved ahead by winning sets two and three 3–1, and a 116 checkout gave him a 3–1 win.\nSecond round.\nThe second round was held from 7 to 8 January. The first second round match, which was played between Adams and Taylor, began with Adams winning the first set on the double 20 ring and led by two legs in set two. A 116 checkout allowed Taylor to tie and then won the third set 3–1. After Adams failed to hit the bullseye ring Taylor won by 3–1. David came from one set behind Van Der Voort early on to win 3–1 with a 114 checkout and a finish of 99 points. He said afterwards: \"I was a bit slow coming out in the first set but I picked it up and I'm very happy with how I played.\" Davies whitewashed Walton 3–0 with two 12-dart finishes and ended on the double 20 ring; Walton missed multiple opportunities to strike a double ring. In the match between Anderson and Fordham, Anderson won the first set on the bullseye ring and Fordham won three legs in a row without reply to level the score. Anderson then claimed the next two sets and finished on the double six ring to win the match 3–1.\nVan Barneveld whitewashed Burton 3–0 with a 12-dart finish; Burton won a single leg in each of the three sets played. Clarys came from two legs behind Wagner to win the first set 3–2 and then whitewashed his opponent 3–0. Monk overcame O'Shea 3–2 in a narrowly fought match that the press positively reviewed. Both players tied at 2–2 and the match concluded with a final set decider. The score went to 5–5 when the referee confirmed a sudden death leg, which Monk won with a 102 checkout by striking the treble 20, single 10 and double 16 rings. Monk said post-match he was exhausted and O'Shea praised his opponent's form. The final second round match saw King defeat Harbour 3–1. Two 12-dart finishes and three maximum scores won King set one. King prevented Harbour from winning the second by hitting the double eight ring. Harbour took the third set before King won the match in the fourth.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe four quarter-finals were played to the best-of-nine sets between 9 and 10 January. Davies averaged 32.73 points per dart thrown in whitewashing David 5–0. He won the opening two sets 3–0 and 3–2. Davies further extended his lead through dart throw accuracy and after David could not strike the double 20 ring in the third set. After the mid-session interval, both players tied the fifth set 2–2 until Davies achieved a 121 checkout to win the match. He entered the semi-finals of the championship for the first time in seven attempts. Post-match David said Davies had outperformed him and the latter expressed a surprise over whitewashing his opponent. Another whitewash occurred when Anderson defeated Taylor 5–0 in an all-Scottish fixture. He compiled checkouts of 161 and 140 and a 13-dart finish en route to victory. Anderson commented on his form: \"I thought I'd win tonight but I thought it would be a lot closer than that. I was fine against Andy Fordham but I felt a little bit nervous tonight. However, I'm through and I've got nothing to lose.\"\nIn the other quarter-finals Van Barneveld achieved a three-dart average of 100.83 and a finish percentage of 59.25 in his 5–1 defeat of Clarys. The match included a tournament-high checkout of 170 from Clarys in the final set. Van Barneveld won the first two sets and Clarys took the third 3–1. Van Barneveld produced a 124 checkout in set four to restore a two set advantage. He took the following two sets 3–0 and 3–2 to qualify for the semi-finals. King whitewashed Monk 5–0 in a repeat of their semi-final game from the 2002 tournament. Both players shared the first four legs of the first set. King hit the double six ring to take a lead he retained for the rest of the game and took the last semi-final spot. He commented on what he needed to defeat Van Barneveld, \"I've got to be looking for a 99 to 100 average against Raymond. As you all know, it's not beyond me. But I'm just looking for the win at the end of day, because the Embassy is what you play for.\"\nSemi-finals.\nBoth of the semi-finals were played on 11 January. Davies defeated Anderson 5–2 to enter the final. The two players began the match by sharing the first two sets each. Davies subsequently produced a 140 checkout to move in front and he further extended his advantage by winning the fourth set with a finish on the double five ring. After the mid-session interval Anderson won the fifth set. Davies responded by claiming the next set 3–2; a 15-dart finish and Davies finishing on the double ten ring in the eighth set won him the match. Davies said he began slower than before and was eager to participate in the final, \"If anyone would have told me at the start of the week that I would be in the final, I'd have laughed. But I've got nothing to lose in this tournament. I've just come here to do as well as I can.\"\nThe other semi-final saw Van Barneveld enter the final with a 5–2 defeat of King and requited a loss to his opponent from the 2002 competition. Both players shared the first four legs of the first set which went to a fifth leg won by Van Barneveld on the double eight ring. Van Barneveld produced a 110 checkout to lead by two sets. Both players attempted a nine-dart finish in the first leg of set three: King missed the triple 20 ring and Van Barneveld the triple 19 on his eighth throw. Van Barneveld converted two 12-dart finishes to lead 3–0. King clinched two sets in a row to be 3–2 behind before Van Barneveld struck the double eight ring and made a 161 checkout to win the match. Post-game, King inculpated his defeat on the trajectory of his darts being affected by the activation of an air conditioning system, something the BDO denied. He commented: \"Under the conditions, I thought I played exceptionally well – but to beat a player like Raymond, everything has to be right and fair.\"\nFinal.\nThe final played between Davies and Van Barneveld on 12 January was held to the best-of-11 sets. Both players missed hitting the double rings before Van Barneveld produced a 132 checkout completed on the double one ring to take the first set 3–1 after twelve dart throws in leg four. He further extended his lead to 4–0 with three consecutive scores of 3–2 achieved from respective finishes on the double 11 ring in the second set, a 116 checkout in the third and finishing in eleven darts in the final leg of the fourth set. Finishes on the double 16 and 11 rings and a 121 checkout secured Davies the fifth set 3–1 and took set five 3–2. During the seventh set Davies won three successive legs from finishes on the double 20 and 10 rings and a 98 checkout. Van Barneveld won the eighth set 3–2 from two checkouts of 76 points and striking the double 18 ring in its fifth leg. Davies claimed the first leg of set nine after Van Barneveld was unable to convert an 84 finish. Van Barneveld made finishes of 96 and 72 points to win the match 6–3.\nVan Barneveld took his third BDO world title after he had won the tournament in 1998 and 1999. He joined Eric Bristow and John Lowe as the third player to win three or more BDO world championships, and earned £50,000 prize money. Van Barneveld commented on the victory: \"When you the win the title for the first time it's very good. After 2000 when I lost in the first round I did not believe in myself. I've had to work hard to get on this level again. Mentally, the fight came back in my life and I started to believe in myself again.\" Davies said he would return to participate at the 2004 event and that the loss of the opening four sets altered his strategy: \"I knew with such a long format I had time to settle down but I gave Raymond too many chances. I was very nervous and, at the start, the darts just would not seem to fall the way they have been doing all week. I was trying and trying but Raymond was always coming up with the big score when he needed it. It is hard to play Raymond because once he gets into a rhythm it is very difficult to stop him. I hit too many single 20s tonight which was also disappointing.\"\nWomen's tournament.\nThe four quarter-finals of the women's tournament took place between 4 and 5 January. Pre-tournament favourite Hoensellar and Krappen played the first quarter-final match. Krappen took the first set 3–0 before Hoensellar won the match 2–1 with set victories of 3–0 and 3–1. Kirk and Williams tied at 2–2 in the first set of their match before Kirk took the fifth leg to claim it. Kirk then won three legs in a row to whitewash Williams 2–0. Gulliver defeated Standley 2–1. Gulliver won the first set 3–0 before Standley won the next set 3–1. Gulliver completed the victory by winning set three. The final quarter-final match saw De Boer whitewash Rogers-Pickett 2–0; Rogers-Pickett tied the second set 2–2 before De Boer struck the double eight ring to win.\nBoth of the semi-finals were held on 9 January. Kirk overcame Hoenselaar in the first set and the latter commenced the second by claiming its first leg. Kirk took three consecutive legs to win 2–0 and earned a berth in the final. The other semi-final match saw Gulliver whitewash De Boer 2–0. De Boer took the match's first leg to which Gulliver replied with high scores for three successive leg victories to win the first set. Gulliver took set two to secure the second final spot.\nThe final was played between Gulliver and Kirk on 11 January. Gulliver took the first leg on the double nine ring and the next two legs to win the first set 3–0. Kirk claimed the first two legs of the second set after Gulliver failed to complete a 121 checkout on the bullseye ring. Gulliver took the next two legs to equal the score and compiled a maximum in the fifth. She won her third BDO world championship by completing a 93 checkout on the double 12 ring. She said of her achievement, \"It hasn't really sunk in yet, but when I think about it, I just think wow! It's unbelievable. Mine's still the only name on the trophy and I never want to give it back! I had a lot of pressure on me, admittedly a lot of it I'd put on myself, but I was able to handle it and hold it together.\"\nPrize fund.\nThe breakdown of prize money for 2003 is shown below.\nMen's tournament\nWomen's tournament\nDraw.\nMen's draw.\nNumbers given to the left of players' names show the seedings for the top eight players in the men's tournament.
