        "title": "Richard Todd (American football)",
        "text": "Carl Richard Todd (born November 19, 1953) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback for the New York Jets and New Orleans Saints of the National Football League (NFL) from 1976 to 1986. Like former Jets quarterback Joe Namath and Raiders quarterback Ken Stabler, he played college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide under coach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant. Todd was selected by the Jets in the first round of the 1976 NFL draft with the sixth overall pick.\nCollege.\nIn high school, Todd attended Davidson High School in Mobile, Alabama. Individually, Todd owned the state shot-put record at the time. He then went on to play for Bear Bryant at the University of Alabama, where he was a three-year starter at quarterback. During his time at Alabama, the Crimson Tide ran the wishbone offense. In his sophomore year, Todd shared the quarterback position with Gary Rutledge. In a game against Virginia Tech, which the Tide won 77-6, Todd was one of four backs who ran for over 100 yards. The 1973 season concluded in the Sugar Bowl, with a 24-23 loss to Notre Dame, for the 1973 National Championship. In that game, Todd caught a 25-yard touchdown pass. \nIn 1974, injuries plagued Todd. The Tide went on to have a rematch with Notre Dame, this time in the Orange Bowl. Todd threw for Alabama's only touchdown in the fourth quarter and helped convert two points, but the Tide again lost to Notre Dame, 13-11. In the Sugar Bowl at the end of the 1975 season, his college career ended in New Orleans against Penn State. Todd threw for over 200 yards, and led Alabama to its first bowl victory in eight years. Alabama never lost an SEC game or beat Notre Dame while Richard Todd was the starting quarterback \nHe would end his college career with 16 TD and 7 INT in 189 PA while running for 1,254 yards and 16 TD.\nProfessional career.\nThe New York Jets selected Todd in the first round of the 1976 NFL draft. Todd would be the last Alabama quarterback taken in the first round until Tua Tagovailoa, who was selected by the Miami Dolphins as the fifth overall pick of the 2020 NFL draft. The intention was for Todd to replace another Alabama legend, Joe Namath, who had led the Jets to their last playoff win in Super Bowl III in 1969. Todd stated that playing on the same team with Namath was \"a dream come true.\" After the 1976 season, Namath was released and Todd, who was 23 years old, was named the starter.\nIn his first five seasons, he threw more interceptions than touchdowns and was booed by fans and criticized by the press. He is also known for an incident in which he shoved reporter Steve Serby into a locker after Serby supported backup quarterback Matt Robinson as starter, instead of him. In a 1980 game against the San Francisco 49ers, in which the Jets had fallen far behind early, Todd, throwing under a prevent zone defense, set a then-NFL record with 42 completions (the record would stand until Drew Bledsoe completed 45 passes in a single game during the 1994 season); the 49ers however won the game, 37-27. Todd threw 30 interceptions in 1980, and the Jets finished 4-12. Late in the 1980 season, Todd's Jets hosted the winless New Orleans Saints; Todd completed only 10 of 27 passes and was intercepted twice, as the Saints grabbed a 21-20 win for their only win of the 1980 season. Also that year, Todd set an NFL record for throwing an interception in 15 games in one season.\nIn 1981, Todd led the Walt Michaels-coached Jets to their first winning record (10-5-1) since 1969, thanks in part to a defense nicknamed the \"New York Sack Exchange.\" In the AFC Wild Card Playoff game against the Buffalo Bills, he led a comeback after the team had fallen behind, 24-0, but fell short, as a late pass was intercepted near the Bills' goal line. The following year, he led the Jets back to the playoffs. New York defeated the defending AFC champion Cincinnati Bengals, 44-17, then beat the Los Angeles Raiders, 17-14, before facing the Dolphins in Miami in the AFC Championship Game. The game was played in the mud and rain, where Todd threw five interceptions in the game and the Jets lost, 14-0. His final year with New York saw a change at head coach, as Walt Michaels was replaced with Jets offensive coordinator Joe Walton. The Jets finished the season at 7-9 and Todd was traded to the New Orleans Saints after the season. His final game as a Jet was ignominious, as he not only threw two interceptions that were returned for a touchdown by the same player (Miami's Mike Kozlowski), but also drew a 15 yard unsportsmanlike penalty for throwing the ball at defensive tackle Mike Charles after a sack.\nTodd played only two seasons in New Orleans, as he replaced another aging, interception-prone (and former Super Bowl winning) Alabama legend at quarterback, Ken Stabler. His first year with the Saints was the worst year of his career, as he threw 19 interceptions and just 11 touchdown passes. In 1985, the Saints went 5-11, a troubling season that included changes in coaching and ownership, and saw Todd losing playing time to Louisiana native Bobby Hebert, who had come to the Saints from the USFL, where he had won a championship with the Michigan Panthers.\nTodd briefly returned to the Jets in 1986 after a knee injury to then QB Ken O’Brien, but did not play.\nAccording to the New York Times, Todd was released from the Jets on October 29, 1986. \nTodd finished his career with 1,610 completions in 2,967 attempts for 20,610 yards and 124 touchdowns, with 161 interceptions. He also rushed for 932 yards and 14 touchdowns."

He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1991. Jones is credited as the first professional player to use weight training to improve his conditioning for football.\nEarly life.\nJones was born in Altoona, Pennsylvania, but grew up in the Harrisburg area after his father, a telephone company employee, was transferred to that area. He then played football at Lemoyne High School in Lemoyne, Pennsylvania. He attended the University of Maryland, where he was a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity.\nCollege career.\nJones attended the University of Maryland, where he played college football as a tackle. He was a unanimous All-American selection in 1953. Jones was on some of the most successful Maryland teams. The Terps were co-champions with Virginia Military Institute in 1951 in the Southern Conference. In 1953, they played in the Atlantic Coast Conference and were co-champions with Duke University. That year, they were also named the national champions. Jones was awarded the Knute Rockne Memorial Trophy as the nation's outstanding lineman and the school awarded him the Anthony Nardo Award as the team's best lineman. He then played in the College All-Star Game against the Detroit Lions.\nProfessional career.\nJones was drafted in the fifth round of the 1953 NFL draft by the Chicago Bears and started in 1954 as an offensive tackle. In 1955, Jones switched to guard and, for the next eight seasons, was a fixture at that position and one of the NFL's most highly respected guards.\nWhen the Bears needed help on defense in 1962, assistant coach George Allen decided that Jones could help at defensive tackle. He played both ways in 1962 and then switched to defensive tackle permanently in 1963.\nAfter 1965, Bears coach George Halas agreed, as a favor to Jones, to trade him to the Washington Redskins so that he could play a final season near his home in Rockville, Maryland. He retired after the 1966 season.\nJones missed only two games his first 11 seasons, was an All-Pro guard in 1955, 1956, 1959, and 1960, and played in seven straight Pro Bowls following the 1955 through 1961 seasons. He has also been credited as the first professional player to use weight training for football conditioning.\nCoaching career.\nAfter playing football, Jones became an assistant coach for the Denver Broncos, Buffalo Bills, Cleveland Browns, and the New England Patriots. He later went back to work, this time as a defensive line coach for the Scottish Claymores of NFL Europe.\nDuring the mid-1950s Jones also worked in the off-season teaching physical education in the Montgomery County elementary schools.\nHonors.\nJones is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and College Football Hall of Fame. In 1977, he made the Atlantic Coast Conference 25-year team. Jones died on May 21, 2010, from complications of a stroke. He had a heart attack which triggered his death. Jones was also named to the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame."

He was called up several times thereafter before becoming the Dodgers' full-time Third Baseman at the start of the 1989 season. Hamilton graduated from Carman-Ainsworth High School.\nAfter a successful 1989 campaign, Hamilton began 1990 as the Dodgers starting third basemen. But after playing with a sore shoulder in spring training, Hamilton was shelved in early April after it was discovered he had torn his rotator cuff - which eventually required season-ending surgery. Hamilton ended up only playing in 7 games for the entire 1990 season.\nHamilton played portions of six seasons during his career, all with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Hamilton was a member of the Dodgers team that won the World Series in 1988 and appeared with Orel Hershiser and Rick Dempsey on the cover of the October 31st 1988 edition of Sports Illustrated. In 1989, he was sixth in the National League in doubles, with 35, and led the NL in putouts by a third baseman, with 139. He played his final MLB game on September 28, 1991, later retiring after a short return to the Albuquerque Dukes in 1992.\nAlthough he was a position player throughout his entire career, he did appear in a ballgame in 1989 as a relief pitcher during a 22-inning ballgame against the Houston Astros. He was credited as the losing pitcher of that ballgame. He struck out Billy Hatcher and Ken Caminiti before giving up the game-winning hit to Rafael Ramirez.

        "text": "Arcade Volleyball is a sports video game written by Rhett Anderson for the Commodore 64 and published as a type-in program in the June 1988 issue of \"COMPUTE!'s Gazette\". It was ported to Amiga and MS-DOS by different programmers and was included in a 12-game collection called \"Best Gazette Games\". The author released the game later into the public domain.\nGameplay.\nThe game features teams of one or two players (depending on the platform) shaped like balls with legs who hit the volleyball with their heads. The game is played from a side-view perspective, and the ball can be bounced off of the walls and ceiling without penalty. Scoring is based on the original volleyball scoring rules, where only the serving team can score on each volley, and 15 points are required to win the game. The same head is permitted to hit the ball multiple times, but the team may only hit the ball three times while the ball is on their side.\nDevelopment.\n\"Arcade Volleyball\" was originally published as a hexadecimal type-in program for MLX in the June 1988 edition of Commodore 64 magazine \"COMPUTE!'s Gazette\". The article was written by Rhett Anderson and David Hensley, Jr., who had also published a similar game called \"Basketball Sam &amp; Ed\" in the July 1987 issue. The game featured two heads per team, controlled by a single player, which moved and jumped together. It was not necessary to win the game by 2 points; when either side reached 15 points, the game would pause and ask if the user wanted to play again.\nBy default the game was played between two human players, but it was possible to modify the game so that one player could play against the computer by typing \"POKE 2065,1\" to type the number 1 into the memory address that controlled the number of players. The authors referred to this as an optional practice mode or warm up mode and warned that the computer opponent was not very challenging. The game was inspired by \"Pong\" (actually, the two-paddle \"Hockey\" variant of \"Pong\") and programmed by Rhett Anderson.\nPorts.\nRhett Anderson and Randy Thompson wrote an Amiga version of \"Arcade Volleyball\" from scratch. It was included as an executable program, with source code, on the cover disk of the Fall 1989 edition of \"Compute!'s Amiga Resource\". The Amiga version differs from the Commodore 64 version by only having one player per team (a green head versus a red head), requires a 2-point margin of victory, it is no longer possible for the ball to go under the net, and playing against the computer is a standard option.* \nThe MS-DOS version was sold in a 9-game collection called \"COMPUTE!'s Best PC Games\". It was written with Borland Turbo C and has the same physics and gameplay as the Amiga version, but uses 4-color CGA graphics and PC speaker sound."

        "text": "\"Snooker Loopy\" is a novelty song released as a single in May 1986, and entered the UK Singles Chart, reaching #6. It was written and performed by Chas &amp; Dave and featured snooker players Steve Davis, Dennis Taylor, Willie Thorne, Terry Griffiths and Tony Meo, as backing vocalists under the name 'The Matchroom Mob' – Matchroom Sport being the company owned by promoter Barry Hearn which employed all these snooker professionals at the time.\nThe lyric is a mild satire on the style and antics of the players involved: \"old Willie Thorne, his hair's all gawn\", for example. The verse on Steve Davis also makes light of the 1985 World Snooker Championship final and his missed black in the final frame, and notes his manager is not concerned who should win the upcoming 1986 Championship, \"because he's got the rest of us signed up!\" Somewhat ironically, the player who won the 1986 World Snooker Championship - Joe Johnson - was not involved, seeing as he was a 150-1 outsider before the tournament. Johnson did, however, go on to release a cover of Everlasting Love later that year.\nUpon reaching the top 10, the players joined Chas &amp; Dave and performed the song on Top of the Pops\nChas &amp; Dave performed the song at their live shows with the original lyrics during the subsequent part of their career, even after all the players mentioned had retired from the professional game; this included a performance at Glastonbury Festival in 2007. The song was mentioned to Ronnie O'Sullivan during an episode of \"A League of Their Own\" in 2012, leading to Freddie Flintoff singing the chorus, with the audience joining in at the end.\nA rival single was released in the same year by snooker players Tony Knowles, Alex Higgins, Kirk Stevens and Jimmy White; it was a cover of \"The Wanderer\", released under the name Four Away.\nIn January 2023, comedian Tom Mayhew and YouTuber Joe Hannard launched \"The Snooker Loopy Podcast\", which takes its name from the song. The podcast features a regular section, \"Cue the Music\", where Joe and Tom review music either related to snooker, or recorded by snooker players. This has included numerous different recordings of the song itself, including solo versions by Dennis Taylor, John Virgo, and listeners of the podcast.\nThe Romford Rap.\nA follow-up snooker song, The Romford Rap, was released in 1987. This time, 'The Matchroom Mob' was made up of Steve Davis, Willie Thorne, Jimmy White, Neal Foulds, Dennis Taylor, Tony Meo and Terry Griffiths. It was far less successful, only reaching #91 in the UK charts."

        "title": "1908 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1908 Tour de France was the sixth running of the annual Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It was organised by the newspaper \"L'Auto\", and took place between 13 July and 9 August. The Tour was split in 14 stages, with a total distance of .\nThe pre-race favourite was Lucien Petit-Breton, winner of the previous Tour. Petit-Breton dominated the race; he won the general classification and five of the fourteen stages, and thus became the first cyclist who won the Tour twice. For the first time, the final podium in Paris was not completely French: François Faber from Luxembourg ended as second in the general classification, after winning four stages.\nInnovations and changes.\nThe 1908 Tour de France followed nearly the same route as the 1907 Tour de France, following the borders of France clockwise. The rules were also the same; the points system was still used instead of the time system to determine the winner.\nBefore the start, the Tour de France organization announced that all necessary measures had been taken to prevent the regrettable incidents as in 1905, and that the 'Apaches' had 90% chance of being caught and spending time in jail. Dismountable tyres were used for the first time; this meant that cyclists could repair their bicycles easier, and a flat tire cost them less time.\nBecause tour organiser Henri Desgrange wanted to keep the Tour de France a race between individual athletes, all cyclists had to ride on frames provided by the Tour organisation. The cyclists were not allowed to change bicycles, so the separation in two different classes in the years before had disappeared, and all cyclists started in the same category.\nParticipants.\nBefore the race started, 162 cyclists had subscribed for the Tour de France, and received starting numbers. 48 cyclists did not start, so the first stage started with 114 cyclists. Cyclists entered the race individually, not in teams; nevertheless some shared the same sponsor and cooperated as if they rode in teams.\nThe favourite for the victory was Lucien Petit-Breton, the winner of the previous edition. He was sponsored by Peugeot, which sponsored also several other strong cyclists; in the five previous editions of the Tour de France, these Peugeot-sponsored cyclists had together won 20 stages. In addition, Petit-Breton was a skilled bicycle mechanic, which was important because the rules said that cyclists had to repair their bicycle without help. The strongest opposition was expected from the cyclists sponsored by Alcyon, led by Georges Passerieu and Gustave Garrigou.\nThe Labor-sponsored cyclists started the race in yellow jerseys; in 1908 the yellow jersey for the race leader was not used yet.\nFrench athlete Marie Marvingt had tried to participate in the 1908 Tour de France, but was refused permission because the race was only open to men. She rode the route after the race, and managed to finish it.\nRace overview.\nAt one stage, Henri Desgrange's car broke down, and the tour organiser had to finish the stage in a horse-drawn carriage.\nIn the first stage, from Paris to Roubaix, the cobbles caused many crashes and flat tyres. It was won by Georges Passerieu, while Petit-Breton finished second.\nThe second stage, from Roubaix to Metz, went through Alsace-Lorraine, which was in 1908 part of the German Empire. As in previous years, nails had been thrown on the road. This stage was won by Petit-Breton with Passerieu in second place. Having both won a stage and finished second in the other, Petit-Breton and Passerieu both had 3 points. Some sources show them joint leaders after that stage, while other sources show Passerieu as single leader.\nIn the third stage, started by Count Zeppelin, the Labor boss sent a telegram to the manager of the team after another crash by a Labor team member (Jean Novo): \"After Novo's crash and the mediocre results of the other riders, I have decided to abandon the race. You can all ease up and come back by train.\" The rest of the Tour would be dominated by the cyclists from Peugeot, who won all the stages. At the third stage, Passerieu finished in 30th place; because Petit-Breton finished second, he was now leading the race by a big margin. The stage was won by Faber. Faber had finished at 49th place in the second stage, so he was no direct threat for the general classification.\nThe fourth stage to Lyon was during a snow storm. Faber won his second stage, and although he was still behind in the general classification, his two consecutive stage wins made him a dangerous competitor.\nIn the sixth stage, the Côte de Laffrey and the Col Bayard were climbed, and André Pottier, the younger brother of the 1906 Tour winner René Pottier, reached the tops first. He could not keep the lead, and Faber passed him. Faber lost the lead when he had to stop to fix his bicycle, and at that point Giovanni Gerbi was in the lead. However, three kilometers before the finish, Gerbi's rear wheel broke; Gerbi could not quickly fix his bicycle, so he walked to the finish carrying his bicycle on his back, and finished in seventh place, while the stage was won by Jean-Baptiste Dortignacq.\nThe seventh stage passed through Crau, in desert-like conditions. Petit-Breton was best suited to this type of weather, and easily won. In the ninth stage, won by Petit-Breton, Faber jumped to the second position in the overall classification, with 57 points, while Petit-Breton was still leading with 18 points. Petit-Breton was at that moment almost guaranteed of the victory, because the remaining stages were all flat, which suited him well.\nPetit-Breton crushed the other cyclists in the eleventh stage, dropping all other cyclists one by one. In the remaining stages the other cyclists tried to beat Petit-Breton by escaping on turns, but Petit-Breton reeled them in each time. In the 13th stage, 415 km from Brest to Caen, the winner Passerieu needed more than 16 hours to finish the stage; the last cyclist to finish that stage, Louis Di Maria, finished 23 hours after Passerieue. Faber could pose no threat to Petit-Breton, and Petit-Breton won the Tour de France easily. His worst placement had been the 10th stage where he finished 10th at one second from the winner; all other stages he was in the top four, winning five of the stages.\nResults.\nStage results.\nAfter the last stage, there was a timed lap of 666 m at the Parc des Princes velodrome in Paris, won by Henri Cornet in 51.2 s. This was not counted as an official stage and had no influence on the overall classification.\nGeneral classification.\nThe general classification was calculated by points: at every stage, the winner was given one point, the next cyclist two points, etc. After the eighth stage, when only 39 cyclists were still in the race, the points given in the first eight stages were redistributed among the remaining cyclists, in accordance with their positions in those stages.\nOf the 114 starting cyclists, 36 finished. The Peugeot team had dominated the race; not only did their cyclists win all 14 stages, but they also had the top four places in the general classification. Even though cyclists entered the race as individuals, officially not connected to sponsors, most cyclists had a sponsor.\nIf the winner would have been determined by the time system as used in 1903 and 1904, Petit-Breton would also have been the winner, with Passerieu in second place, Garrigou in third and Faber in fourth.\nOther classifications.\nSecond-placed François Faber became the winner of the \"pneus démontables\" category.\nThe organising newspaper l'Auto named Gustave Garrigou the \"meilleur grimpeur\". This unofficial title is the precursor to the mountains classification.\nPrize money.\nIn total, 25000 Francs were distributed in the 1908 Tour de France. The 1908 Tour was split into fourteen stages, and in all but the last stage, the best cyclists received prize money. Between 400 and 500 French Francs was for the winner of each stage, down to 40 Francs for the seventh cyclist to finish. After the last stage, prizes were given for the position in the general classification: 5000 Francs for the winner, down to 100 Francs for the 25th place. All riders that finished were given at least 5 Francs per day. The winner Petit-Breton won 8050 Francs in this way; runner-up Faber won 4595 Francs.\nAftermath.\nLucien Petit-Breton became the first cyclist to win two Tours de France. He wrote a book about his life, \"Comment je cours sur route\". This became a success, and he started to write cycling columns for newspapers. In the next Tour in 1909, Petit-Breton did not participate as a cyclist, but followed the race as a columnist."

It was created by former AFC president Mohammed Bin Hammam as the AFC's plan for a continent-wide programme to raise the standards of Asian football. The AFC Challenge Cup was created for teams to experience playing in a continental competition, with the possibility to win an AFC trophy and potentially discover new talents.\nThe inaugural tournament was hosted by Bangladesh in 2006 and was held biennially. An amendment to men's national team competitions in July 2006, meant that starting with the 2008 and 2010 editions of the AFC Challenge Cup, the winners automatically qualify for the AFC Asian Cup.\nIn the 2011 and 2015 AFC Asian Cup tournaments, two qualification spots have been allocated to the two most recent AFC Challenge Cup winners. The 2014 tournament was the last edition of this competition, due to the expansion of the Asian Cup to the 24-nations format from the 16-nations one after the 2015 edition. In April 2016, due to several associations requesting a new competition to replace the Challenge Cup as they were having problems arranging friendly matches, the AFC created the AFC Solidarity Cup.\nSelection of teams.\nThe AFC initially divided their 46 member nations into three groups in 2006. Although the tournament was meant for the countries of \"emerging associations\" class, some countries from the \"developing associations\" class have participated in the qualification and the finals of the tournament such as India, Maldives, Myanmar, North Korea, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. As a result, only one team from the emerging class ever won the tournament, Palestine in 2014. In late March 2012, the Northern Mariana Islands Football Association, although only an associate member of the AFC, was approved to enter their national team in the competition. In November 2012, the AFC announced North Korea's exclusion from future AFC Challenge Cups.\nThe top 15 are classed as \"developed associations\":\nThe next 14 are classed as \"developing associations\":\nThe last 17 are classed as \"emerging associations\", which need time to develop their football.

The cup winner was Tajikistan. The fair play award was won by Sri Lanka and Tajik Ibrahim Rabimov won the most valuable player award.\nSelection of teams.\nThe AFC classed seventeen nations as \"emerging associations\", which need time to develop their football.

Laos, Mongolia, and Timor-Leste were initially selected to participate, but were later replaced by Bangladesh and India of the \"developing associations\" class, reducing the number of participating teams to sixteen.\nHosts and stadia.\nThe AFC decided at its annual meeting, that Bangladesh would host the opening ceremony and that Nepal would host the final unless Bangladesh makes it into the last two, in which case it would be held in Dhaka, its capital. It was originally planned that the teams in Groups A and B would play their games in Nepal and that teams in Groups C and D would play in Bangladesh, but due to the political unrest that shook Nepal, it was decided that only Bangladesh would host the tournament. The Challenge Cup was originally scheduled to take place between 26 March to 9 April 2006 but was changed to avoid clashes with Bangladesh's Independence Day on 26 March.

        "title": "French school of fencing",
        "text": "The known history of fencing in France begins in the 16th century, with the adoption of Italian styles of fencing.\nThere are medieval predecessors, such as the Burgundian \"Le jeu de la hache\" (\"The Play of the Axe\") of ca. 1400, but the history of the classical French school begins with the foundation of the \"Académie des Maistres en faits d’armes de l’Académie du Roy\" (also known as the \"École française d’Escrime\") by Charles IX of France in December 1567.\nOne master produced by this school was , author of a 1573 treatise titled \"Traicté contenant les secrets du premier livre sur l'espee seule\" (Treatise containing the secrets of the first book on the single sword), dedicated to Charles IX.\nRapier treatises are known from the early seventeenth century, such as François Dancie's \"Discours des armes et methode pour bien tirer de l'espée et poignard\" (c.1610) and \"L'espée de combat\" (1623) and André Desbordes' \"Discours de la théorie et de la pratique de l'excellence des armes\" (1610), with both authors citing the Italian origins of their systems. Earlier, in 1597, the great traveller Seigneur de Villamont translated Girolamo Cavalcabo of Bologna’s treatise into French, along with a shorter piece by Paternostrier of Rome.\nFencing in France was developed into a sport during the 17th century, with codification of rules and terminology and a system of teaching. Cesar Cavalcabo from Italy and son of Italian fencing master Hieronymus was invited to teach the great fencing tradition of Bologna to the future Louis XIII, and has influenced the development of French swordplay in the early seventeenth century. Also, the art of fencing in France was taught by local masters such as Le Perche du Coudray (1635, 1676, teacher of Cyrano de Bergerac), Besnard (1653, teacher of Descartes), Philibert de la Touche (1670) and L'Abbat of Toulouse (1690, 1696).\nThe modern foil was developed in France as a training technique in the middle of the 18th century; it provided practice of fast and elegant thrust fencing with a smaller and safer weapon than an actual dueling sword. Fencers blunted (or \"foiled\") its point by wrapping a foil around the blade or fastening a knob on the point (\"fleuret,\" \"blossom\").\nGerman students took up that practice and developed the \"Pariser\" (\"Parisian\") thrusting small sword for their academic fencing bouts.\nBy the 18th century, the French school had become the western European standard to the extent, that Domenico Angelo, an Italian-born master teaching in England, published his \"L'école des Armes\" in French in 1763. It was extremely successful and became a standard fencing manual over the following 50 years, throughout the Napoleonic period. Angelo's text was so influential that it was chosen to be included under the heading of \"Éscrime\" in Diderot's \"Encyclopédie\".\nThe emergence of classical sports fencing in the 19th century was a direct continuation of the French tradition."

        "text": "New Zealand competed at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy.\nThe nation sent its largest team ever to the games with 18 athletes, 7 more than in Salt Lake City in 2002. New Zealand has only won a single Winter Olympics medal, a silver medal in Albertville.\nAlpine skiing.\nNew Zealand's top finisher in alpine skiing, Mickey Ross, survived a fall in the first run of the men's slalom to record a 31st-place finish.\nBobsleigh.\nThe New Zealand team did not compete in the four-man bobsleigh due to injuries from a training run. Mathew Dallow and Alan Henderson did compete in the two-man event, but did not qualify for the final run.\nCurling.\nThe New Zealand national men's team qualified for the games after placing 8th at the 2005 World Championships. The team heading to Turin was skipped by Sean Becker, out of Ranfurly CC. The New Zealand men's team is the first team from the southern hemisphere to compete in curling as an official sport at the Olympics. Australia had previously competed in curling at the Olympics, but that was as a demonstration sport.\nSean Becker's rink twice lost games late, including giving up two in the final end to fall to the eventual silver medalists from Finland. However, these were the only bright spots for the New Zealand side, which finished the round robin in last place, without a victory.\nMen's.\nTeam: Sean Becker (skip), Hans Frauenlob, Dan Mustapic, Lorne Depape, Warren Dobson (alternate)\nSkeleton.\nSkeleton provided New Zealand with its two best finishes in Turin, including its only top-10, from Ben Sandford. Sandford had the fifth fastest second run, but his slower first run left him in 10th place.\nSnowboarding.\nAll three New Zealand snowboarders in Turin competed in the halfpipe, with Juliane Bray being the closest to qualifying for the final, finishing 16th overall. Bray also entered the snowboard cross, but was unable to qualify for the knockout rounds.\nNote: In the final, the single best score from two runs is used to determine the ranking. A bracketed score indicates a run that wasn't counted.\nFlag bearer.\nSean Becker, the captain of New Zealand's curling team, carried the flag for the New Zealand team in both the opening and closing ceremonies. There was some controversy about the later of these, as the position of closing ceremony flag bearer is usually reserved for the best-performed competitor from the country and the curling team had finished last in their competition.\nTraditionally the New Zealand team flag bearer at an Olympic games wears a blessed Māori cloak called the Kotahu."

        "title": "Champion Baseball",
        "text": " is an arcade baseball video game developed by Alpha Denshi and published by Sega in March 1983. It was a sophisticated sports video game for its time, displaying a split-screen format, with the playfield viewed from two camera angles, one from the outfield and another close-up shot of the batter and pitcher, while giving players the option of selecting relief pitchers or pinch hitters and with an umpire looking on attentively to make the game calls. The game also had digitized voices for the umpire, and individual player statistics. A person could play for hours with one token providing they tied scores at the 9th and further innings.\nThe game was a blockbuster success in Japanese arcades when released in 1983, and was a departure from the \"space games\" and \"cartoon\" action games that had previously dominated the arcades. It went on to serve as the prototype for later baseball video games. Nintendo, for example, released their own competitor \"Baseball\" later the same year.\nGameplay.\nThe player controls a baseball team, against a computer-controlled team, with the player batting at the top of each inning. In a two-player game, each will play independently against the computer, one inning at a time. Standard baseball rules apply, with the player awarded points for various accomplishments such as hitting a pitch, safely reaching any base, pitching a strike, getting a computer player out, or retiring the computer's side to end an inning.\nBefore play begins, the player can choose which city/state to represent from a list containing Los Angeles, Cincinnati, Atlanta, Pittsburg (probably a typo for Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), Chicago, Montreal, St. Louis, Boston, Milwaukee, New York City, California and Texas (all of whom had major-league baseball franchises in 1983). The computer then randomly selects from among the remaining cities.\nIf at any time the computer team has scored more runs than the player, the game immediately ends. The high-scores list (\"FAR OUT PLAYERS\") can hold the initials of up to six players.\nReception.\nThe game was a blockbuster success upon release in Japanese arcades, at one point enjoying a level of popularity comparable to \"Space Invaders\" according to Sega. Like \"Space Invaders\", there were many arcade locations across Japan dedicated exclusively to \"Champion Baseball\". Sega had sold over 15,000 arcade units in Japan by early June 1983, and were expecting to ship a further 10,000 arcade units within the country by the end of June. It was Japan's highest-grossing arcade game around mid-1983.\nWhen Japanese magazine \"\" published their first bi-weekly arcade charts in their June 1, 1983 issue, \"Champion Baseball\" was listed as the most successful table arcade cabinet of the month. It remained at the top of the \"Game Machine\" table arcade game charts for three months through June and July to August 1983, before eventually being dethroned by \"Elevator Action\" in September. \"Champion Baseball\" remained in the top ten for the rest of the year, through December 1983.\nIn North America, the game was successful in test locations around mid-1983. Sega were expecting to repeat some of the game's Japanese success in North America, due to baseball being a popular sport in the region. Upon release in North America, it became one of the best-performing arcade video games distributed by Sega Electronics (formerly Sega/Gremlin) in 1983. However, the golden age of arcade video games was coming to an end in North America, with Sega closing down its Sega Electronics division and selling it to Bally Manufacturing later that year.\nLegacy.\n\"Champion Baseball II\" was released the same year, with identical graphics but allowing two players to compete with each other. \"Game Machine\" listed the sequel on their October 1, 1983 issue as being the top-grossing new table arcade unit of the month. Another sequel, titled \"Super Champion Baseball\", was released in 1989.\nImpact.\nUpon release, the sports gameplay of \"Champion Baseball\" was a departure from the \"space games\" and \"cartoon\" action games that had previously dominated the arcades. \"Champion Baseball\" went on to serve as the prototype for later baseball video games. Nintendo, for example, later released their own competing sports game, \"Baseball\", initially for the Famicom console in late 1983 and then ported to the arcade Nintendo VS. System as \"VS. Baseball\" in 1984. While \"VS. Baseball\" lacked certain features of \"Champion Baseball\", it had improved multiplayer capabilities."

        "text": "John Alban Edwards (born June 10, 1938) is an American former professional baseball player. He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball for the Cincinnati Reds (1961–67), St. Louis Cardinals (1968) and Houston Astros (1969–74). Known for his excellent defensive skills, Edwards was a three-time All-Star and a two-time National League Gold Glove Award winner. He batted left-handed, threw right-handed, and was listed as tall and .\nPlaying career.\nBorn in Columbus, Ohio, Edwards graduated from West High School, and then Ohio State University, where he led the team in hits (24) in 1958 and became a member of Phi Kappa Tau fraternity. He was signed as an amateur free agent by the Cincinnati Reds in 1959.\nHe made his Major League debut at age 23 on June 27, 1961, in a 10–8 Reds' win over the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. In his first at-bat he pinch-hit in the seventh inning for Reds' starting catcher Jerry Zimmerman, drawing a walk against reliever Barney Schultz and later scoring on a triple by Jerry Lynch. In his next at-bat, in the ninth inning, he got his first hit and first RBI, driving in Gordy Coleman with a single against reliever Joe Schaffernoth.\nDuring Edwards' rookie season, he backed up Zimmerman and helped the Reds win the 1961 National League pennant. In the 1961 World Series Edwards had 4 hits and 2 RBIs in a losing cause, as the New York Yankees defeated the Reds in 5 games.\nHe put up solid offensive numbers from 1962 to 1965, earning three MLB All Star appearances. His offensive numbers diminished after he suffered a broken finger on the last day of spring training in 1966, but he continued to be one of the best defensive catchers in the National League. On June 14, 1965, Edwards was the Reds catcher when pitcher Jim Maloney went 10 innings against the New York Mets without allowing a hit. Edwards left the game in the 10th inning for a pinch runner with the game in a scoreless tie, as the Mets went on to break up the no-hitter and score a run to win the game in the 11th inning. A little more than two months later, on August 19, 1965, Edwards was once again the catcher as Maloney threw another 10 innings without allowing a hit. This time the Reds scored a run, securing the victory and the no-hitter for Maloney.\nWith the arrival of Johnny Bench, the Reds traded Edwards to the St. Louis Cardinals for Pat Corrales and Jimy Williams on February 8, 1968. With the Cardinals, he played backup catcher to Tim McCarver, helping them win the National League pennant, however, they would subsequently lose to the Detroit Tigers in the 1968 World Series. He caught Ray Washburn's no-hitter on September 18 of that 1968 season. On October 11, 1968, Edwards was traded with minor league player Tommy Smith to the Houston Astros for Dave Giusti and Dave Adlesh. After playing his first season for the Houston Astros in 1969, he finished 36th in voting for the National League Most Valuable Player Award.\nHis final game played, at age 36, was a 5–4 10-inning Astros' loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers at the Astrodome on October 2, 1974. In his final plate appearance, pinch-hitting in the 10th inning for Skip Jutze against the Dodgers' Eddie Solomon, Edwards drew a walk.\nCareer statistics.\nIn a fourteen-year major league career, Edwards played in 1,470 games, producing 1,106 hits in 4,577 at bats for a .242 batting average along with 81 home runs, 524 runs batted in and a .311 on-base percentage. A solid defensive player, he had a career fielding percentage of .992 which was 4 points above the league average, helping him earn the National League Gold Glove Award for catchers in 1963 and 1964\nEdwards was voted to three National League All-Star teams in 1963, 1964 and 1965. He led National League catchers in fielding percentage four times in 1963, 1969, 1970 and 1971. He also led the league four times in assists and three times in putouts. In 1969, Edwards set single season records for catchers with 1,135 putouts and 1,221 total chances.\nRichard Kendall of the Society for American Baseball Research devised an unscientific study that ranked Edwards as the second most dominating fielding catcher in major league history. He caught 109 shutouts during his career, ranking him 22nd all-time among major league catchers. As of the end of the 2016 Major League Baseball season he ranked 86th on the All-Time Intentional Walks List.\nPersonal life.\nEdwards earned a degree in Engineering from Ohio State. During the off-seasons while with the Reds, he worked as an engineer for General Electric in research and development for nuclear fuel elements. He was inducted into the Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame in September 2008."

        "text": "Michael Ware (born March 22, 1967) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played for the Edmonton Oilers, as well as in Europe, where he was primarily an enforcer.\nPlaying career.\nWare began his major junior career with the Hamilton Steelhawks of the OHL in 1984, having been drafted 26th overall in the 1984 OHL priority selection. At the end of his rookie season with the Steelhawks, he was selected by the Edmonton Oilers, 62nd overall in the \n1985 NHL Entry Draft. He played a second season in Hamilton, before moving to the Cornwall Royals. Following his season in Eastern Ontario he turned professional.\nWare signed with the Oilers AHL affiliate Nova Scotia Oilers where he registered 253 PIM and 8 points as a rookie during the 1987-88 season. The farm team relocated within the province, and become the Cape Breton Oilers. Ware remained the with team, but also played two games in the NHL, making his debut in January 1989 in a game against the Los Angeles Kings, where early in his first (and only) shift of the night, he fought Jay Miller. In his next game against the Vancouver Canucks, Ware registered his only point in the NHL, an assist on a Miroslav Fryčer goal. Whilst playing for the affiliate team, his production increased, tallying 12 points and 317 PIM whilst in Cape Breton. For the 1989-90 season, Ware primarily played in Cape Breton, whilst also playing 3 games in NHL. Ware returned to Nova Scotia for the 1990-91 season, registering 12 points and 176 PIM in 43 games. During his time in Cape Breton, Ware received a 20 game suspension for breaking his stick over the glass, and subsequently throwing it at a referee.\nFor the 1991-92 season, Ware moved to the U.K. in order to play for the Murrayfield Racers of the British Hockey League. In Edinburgh he had a stellar season, scoring 60 points in 33 games, whilst also accruing 218 PIM. The team finished 2nd in the league, before being beaten 9-0 in the playoff semifinals to eventual champions the Cardiff Devils. Ware returned to the Racers for the following season, again increasing his scoring output, with 71 points in 43 games; the team finished mid-table and didn't make it out the group stages during the playoffs. The team changed its name to the Edinburgh Racers for the 1994-95 season, which saw Ware have a career year, with 79 points in 40 games, and the Racers reached the playoff final, ultimately losing to the Sheffield Steelers. The following season, Ware remained in the BHL, but moved to the Cardiff Devils, beginning his association with the club. The Devils had a strong season, finishing 2nd in the league, but they crashed out in the group stages of the playoffs.\nFollowing the culmination of the 1995-96 season, the BHL folded, and the BISL took its place as the top tier of hockey in the U.K, of which Cardiff were a founding member. Ware remained with the team and was named captain. In the maiden BISL season, The Devils were named league champions, however they lost in the play semifinals to eventual winners Sheffield Steelers. Ware subsequently joined the Steelers in the off-season, but the team struggled, thanks in no small part to the Ayr Scottish Eagles completing the British Grand Slam. For the 1998-99 season, Ware moved to Germany, to play for DEL side Hannover Scorpions. There, Ware managed only 6 points in 44 games, whilst registering 103 PIM. Ware returned the U.K. the following season, signing for the London Knights. With the Knights, Ware totalled 8 points and 90 PIM in 26 games, as the Knights were crowned British champions after beating the Newcastle Riverkings 7-3 in the playoff final.\nWare returned to the Devils for the 2000-01 season, where he registered 10 points and 155 PIM in 40 games. The team performed well, finishing 2nd in the league, however, they didn't make it past the group stages in the playoffs. At the end of the season the Cardiff Devils went into voluntary liquidation, and as a result were stripped of their BISL franchise. The team eventually reformed and participated in the British National League, which was at the time the second tier of ice hockey in the UK. As a result, Ware moved back to the London Knights for the following season, linking up with former Devils teammates Ian MacIntyre, Kim Ahlroos, Steve Thornton and Vezio Sacratini. The team struggled, finishing 6th out of 7 teams, with Ware producing only 6 points and 33 PIM in 35 games.\nThe Terminator, as he was known to fans, returned to the Welsh capital for the third time and was named team captain for the 2002-03 season. The Devils made it to the BNL finals, ultimately losing to the Coventry Blaze. Ware had a good season, tallying 32 points and 96 PIM in 30 games.\nFollowing the culmination of the 2002-03 season, the London Knights, as well as the Manchester Storm and Ayr Scottish Eagles all folded, whilst the Bracknell Bees dropped down the BNL. This resulted in the demise of the BISL. Cardiff was a founding member of the EIHL, which became the new top tier of hockey in the U.K., and as such Ware remained with the team for the inaugural EIHL season where he remained as team captain. During the season, the Devils awarded Ware a testimonial game as a result of his service with the team, and popularity with the fans. The team reached the playoff semifinals, before losing to the Sheffield Steelers, following which Ware retired from hockey.\nPersonal life.\nWare's nephew Phil Oreskovic, was also a professional hockey player, having played 10 games for the Toronto Maple Leafs, as well as in various North American minor leagues."

        "text": "Summer Heat Beach Volleyball is a beach volleyball video game released by Acclaim in 2003 for the PlayStation 2 gaming console.\nGameplay.\n\"Summer Heat\" follows the basic rules of the sport of beach volleyball. Two teams of two players each face off in a sectioned-off area of sand that serves as the playing area. One player serves the ball, and play begins. The objective is to land the ball on the ground within the play area of the other team's side. Players alternate hitting (\"volleying\") the ball, up to three volleys per turn, and the ball must travel over the net no later than the third hit. The game supports up to four players, though the use of a multitap accessory is required for three and four player games. \"Summer Heat\" is styled similarly to other arcade-style volleyball games of the era, where there is an emphasis on the sex appeal of the bikini-clad female characters as well as having the overall tone and atmosphere of a summer beach party.\nMusic.\n\"Summer Heat's\" soundtrack features music from Pink, Sum 41, Kylie Minogue, Sprung Monkey, Freshmaka, and Suburban.\nReception.\nThe game was released during a period where volleyball video games were experiencing a period of renewed popularity for the first time in many years, although it received considerably less hype and critical praise than its contemporaries \"Beach Spikers\", \"Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball\", and \"Outlaw Volleyball\". It received \"mixed\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\nThe game was one of several poor-selling titles that would lead to Acclaim's bankruptcy in 2004.\nFuture.\nIn 2006, Canadian game publisher Throwback Entertainment acquired the property rights for \"Summer Heat Beach Volleyball\" from Acclaim. Throwback had planned on developing another \"Summer Heat\" volleyball game for release on the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360, but there is no word on the status of such a game. \"Summer Heat Volleyball\" is expected to keep its identity and will not be dissolved or merged."

The Veterans Committee held elections both for players who were active no later than 1981 and for non-players (managers, umpires and executives), but did not select anyone.\nThe induction ceremonies were held on July 27 in Cooperstown, with Commissioner Bud Selig presiding.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was again authorized to elect players active in 1983 or later, but not after 1997; the ballot included candidates from the 2002 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 1997. In addition, Darryl Kile was exempted from the five-season rule and included on the ballot, due to his unexpected death during the 2002 season. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. Results of the 2003 election by the BBWAA were announced on January 7. The ballot consisted of 33 players; 496 ballots were cast, with 372 votes required for election. A total of 3272 individual votes were cast, an average of 6.60 per ballot. Those candidates receiving less than 5% of the vote (25 votes) will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†). The two candidates who received at least 75% of the vote and were elected are indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\". The 13 candidates who received less than 5% of the vote, thus becoming ineligible for future BBWAA consideration, are indicated with an asterisk (*).\nJim Kaat was on the ballot for the 15th and final time.\nThe newly eligible candidates included 22 All-Stars, five of whom were not on the ballot, who were selected a total of 68 times. Ryne Sandberg was selected a total of ten times, while Eddie Murray (eight times), Lee Smith (seven), Fernando Valenzuela (six) and Tony Peña (five) were all selected at least five times. The field included four Rookies of the Year (Murray, Valenzuela, Vince Coleman and Todd Worrell), as well as one MVP (Sandberg) and two Cy Young Award winners (Valenzuela and Mark Davis). Fernando Valenzuela is the only player ever so far to win a Cy Young Award and a Rookie of the Year Award in the same season.\nPlayers eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: Damon Berryhill, Mike Bielecki, Darnell Coles, Mariano Duncan, Álvaro Espinoza, Greg Gagne, Mike Gallego, Rene Gonzales, Kevin Gross, Mark Gubicza, Ron Karkovice, Joe Orsulak, Jody Reed, Bruce Ruffin, Kevin Seitzer, Don Slaught, and John Smiley.\nVeterans Committee.\nRules enacted in August 2001 provided that the Veterans Committee would be expanded from its previous 15 members, elected to limited terms, and it would vote by mail rather than convene. The new committee would comprise all living members of the Hall of Fame, recipients of the Spink Award (broadcasters), recipients of the Frick Award (writers), and members of the old committee until expiration of their terms. They would vote by mail using \"ballots and supporting material -- prepared by the Hall of Fame\".\nThe process would cover players every two years and other contributors (managers, umpires and executives) every four years. Both cycles first concluded with elections in February 2003, electing no one. (In the event, the system was reformed again after the third fruitless election for players and the second for other contributors in February 2007.)\nNomination.\nA new Historical Overview Committee comprising ten baseball writers nominated 200 players and 60 managers, umpires, and executives.\nPlayers.

Meanwhile, six Hall of Fame members independently selected five nominated players, making 25 to 30 players. Evidently the writers passed over one man selected by the Hall of Famers, for there were 26 players on the final ballot.\nVoting.\nAmong 85 eligible voters, 81 cast ballots so 61 votes were the minimum to elect a candidate.

He then played for the University of Maine for 4 years. He spent time playing for the ECHL's Columbus Cottonmouths, Greenville Grrrowl, and the AHL with the Edmonton Road Runners.\nAfter the NHL lockout, Morrison was given a chance to play in the NHL when goaltenders Ty Conklin and Jussi Markkanen were unable to work for the Edmonton Oilers. He made his NHL debut on November 7, 2005, playing 18 minutes in relief during a shut-out defeat to the Dallas Stars. In his first start at Denver, he stopped 31 shots to put his team on top 5–2 against the home team, the Colorado Avalanche on November 14. He eventually became the Oilers' starting goaltender. On March 7, 2006, Oilers head coach Craig MacTavish made a decision to replace Conklin with Morrison before heading into a shootout against the Dallas Stars. The Oilers ended up losing by a shootout goal from Jussi Jokinen.\nOn March 8, 2006 the Oilers traded their 1st round pick in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft to the Minnesota Wild for goaltender Dwayne Roloson. Since Edmonton had to unload a goaltender and could not find a trade partner, they placed Morrison on waivers, and he was picked up by the Ottawa Senators to back up Ray Emery.\nOn July 2, 2006, he was signed as a free agent by the Phoenix Coyotes to back up former Curtis Joseph and work with head coach Wayne Gretzky, and goaltender coach Grant Fuhr, all former Oilers. After posting a 0–3 record, a 6.14 goals against average and a .790 save percentage, Morrison was placed on waivers once again. He was not picked up and was sent to the minors.

He played college football at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\nEarly life.\nThomas was born in Birmingham, Alabama. He attended the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where he played college football for the UAB Blazers.\nProfessional career.\nThe 6'4\" Thomas had an impressive combine performance that elevated him from a mid-second round pick to the first round.\nThomas played 15 games in his rookie year of 2002 collecting a half-sack and 5 total tackles.\nThomas played all 16 games (10 started) in 2003 with a sack, 3 passes defended, one fumble recovery, and 26 total tackles.\nThomas played in 14 games (6 started) of the 2004 season with 1.5 sacks, a pass defended, and 28 total tackles.\nPlaying 16 games (4 starts) of the 2005 season, Thomas has 3.5 sacks, 2 passes defended, and 25 total tackles\nThomas played his entire career as a defensive end until being converted to a linebacker in the 3-4 defense for the Jets during the 2006 NFL season.

This was his breakout season playing as an outside linebacker with new head coach Eric Mangini. At the end of the 2006 season, Thomas was awarded a new contract.\nIn 2007, Thomas reverted to the disappointing play that had previously been the hallmark of his career. This raised concerns that Thomas was a \"one year wonder\" or a \"contract year\" player. In particular, comments made by Thomas during the 2007 season where he said he had not thought it necessary to \"continue to work to improve\" left many Jets fans extremely concerned. Overall, Thomas finished the 2007 season with 2.5 sacks, one pass defended, a forced fumble, and 39 total tackles.\nThomas had a mediocre 2008 season as he collected 5.5 sacks, one pass defended, 2 forced fumbles (1 recovery), and 38 total tackles.\nThomas collected 2 sacks, one pass defended, 2 fumble recoveries, and 41 total tackles.

The headquarters of CGF are located in London, England.\nHistory.\nDue to the success of the first 1930 British Empire Games in Hamilton, Canada, a meeting of representatives from Great Britain, its dominions, colonies and territories decided that the games, similar to the Olympic Games should be held every four years, and that an authoritative organisation should be formed. Following the 1932 Summer Olympics, it was decided to form the \"British Empire Games Federation\" who would be responsible for the organising of the games. The name of the federation was changed in 1952 to the \"British Empire and Commonwealth Games Federation\", and again in Jamaica in 1966 to the \"British Commonwealth Games Federation\", until eventually being changed again in Christchurch, New Zealand in 1974 to the \"Commonwealth Games Federation\".\nThe youth version of the Commonwealth Games was launched in August 2000, which is known as the Commonwealth Youth Games. The inaugural edition of the Commonwealth Youth Games was first held in Edinburgh, Scotland.\nCGF Executive Board.\nThe following people are in the CGF executive board:\nThe following people are the Honorary members of the CGF executive board:\nOrganisation.\nCGF General Assembly.\nThe General Assembly is the ultimate governance and authority in the CGF with powers to vote on decisions, including on which cities and Commonwealth Games Association's will host the Commonwealth Games. It consists of 3 or more representatives of a Commonwealth Games Association of each member countries and territories, the Vice-Patron, Life Vice-Presidents and the members of the Executive Board.\nSessions of the General Assembly are chaired by the CGF President, with each CGA and the President having one vote. However the Vice-Patron, Life Vice-Presidents, the Executive Board, representatives of an Organising Committee (OC) of a Commonwealth Games and observers invited by the President may deliberate but do not have voting powers at the General Assembly.\nHonours.\nAs well as awarding medals to athletes, the Federation may award membership of the Order of Merit (Commonwealth Games Federation) for distinguished services rendered to the Commonwealth Games movement, including the games themselves, to the federation and to a Commonwealth Games Association. The honour is awarded on the recommendation of the Executive Board at the General Assembly.\nOn recommendation of the Executive Board, at General Assembly the federation may also elect Life Vice-Presidents, providing there are no more than six Life Vice-Presidents at a time as an award for services to the CGF. Former Chairmen and presidents automatically become a Life Vice-President.\nLeadership.\nThe President of the Commonwealth Games Federation is responsible for chairing the Executive Board and the General Assembly. A candidate is elected to the position by the General Assembly the year following the Commonwealth Games. Other duties include inviting the Head of the Commonwealth for the opening and closing declaration of the games and overseeing the preparations for upcoming events.\nPreviously before the XVI Commonwealth Games in 1998, the President was a ceremonial role, taking on the duties of the Vice-Patron. The late Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh served as the president between 1955 and 1990. The chairman was elected by the General Assembly as head of the Commonwealth Games Federation."

        "text": "Michael Dion Bates (born December 19, 1969) is an American former two-sport athlete who gained fame as a sprinter who won an Olympic bronze medal in the 200-meter dash in 1992. He also played football as a kick returner in the National Football League (NFL), where he was a five-time Pro Bowl selection. He played college football for the Arizona Wildcats.\nEarly years.\nBates attended Amphitheater High School, where he lettered in football and track. He played as a running back, recording more than 1,000 rushing yards in each of his last three seasons. As a senior, although he played in only 8 games because of an injury, he still managed to run for 1,557 yards.\nHe set state records in the 100 metres (10.34 seconds) and 200 metres (20.68 seconds). He bypassed his senior season in track, while disputing some scheduling rules by the Arizona Interscholastic Association.\nAs a senior, he received \"Parade magazine\" All-American, The Arizona Republic's male Athlete of the Year and \"Long Beach Press-Telegram\" \"Best in the West\" honors. He was rated by \"Parade\" as the second-best prospect in the country at running back behind Terry Kirby.\nIn 2014, he was inducted into the Pima County Sports Hall of Fame.\nCollege career.\nBates accepted a football scholarship from the University of Arizona. He played as a running back and wide receiver with the Wildcats, but was mainly used as a kickoff returner, averaging 23.7 yards on 45 kickoff returns during his college career.\nAs a true freshman in 1989, he had 14 returns for a 24.1-yard average. As a sophomore in 1990, he ranked among the All-purpose leaders in the Pac-10 and received honorable-mention honors. His 97-yard kickoff return for a touchdown against Washington State University was the fourth-longest in school history. He collected 31 kickoff returns for a 23.5-yard average.\nIn track, he was voted the Pac-10's Outstanding Male Performer at the conference track championships in 1989 and 1990, winning the 100 and 200 metres. He was also a member of the Wildcats 400-meter relay team that finished second in the 1989 NCAA Championships. His college-best time was 10.17 in the 100 metres.\nIn 1991, he did not enroll at the school so he could concentrate on his track career. He declared for the NFL draft in 1992.\nIn 2013, he was inducted into the University of Arizona Sports Hall of Fame.\nOlympics.\nAt the June 1992 US Olympic Trials he finished third, qualifying for the Olympics, edging Carl Lewis by one one-hundredth of a second for the final qualifying spot.\nIn the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, his time of 20.38 from the inside lane, put him 0.37 seconds behind gold medal winner Michael Marsh and 0.25 seconds behind silver medalist Frankie Fredericks to win the bronze medal. He set his personal best time in the 200 metres – 20.01 seconds – at the Weltklasse meet in Zürich 13 days after the Olympics.\nProfessional career.\nBates was selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the sixth round (150th overall) of the 1992 NFL draft. Because of contract negotiations, he did not sign with Seattle and held out during the 1992 season, although the time away from playing helped him to reshape his body for football.\nOn March 7, 1993, he signed an incentive laden contract including a $15k workout bonus, $10k playoff percentage time bonus and over $50k in performance bonus. He was a backup wide receiver, setting a franchise team record with 22 special teams tackles and was a Pro Bowl alternate to Steve Tasker. In 1995, Bates was an exclusive rights free agent where Seattle ended up agreeing to terms with him on a 1-year $700k deal in July. After new head coach Dennis Erickson traded for Ricky Proehl and drafted Joey Galloway, Bates became expendable and was waived August 27.\nOn August 28, 1995, the Carolina Panthers claimed Bates off waivers only to turn around and trade him the next day to the Cleveland Browns in exchange for linebacker Travis Hill. Bates spent the last 3 games of the season on the inactive list and was not retained. On March 11, 1996, he signed as a free agent with the Panthers and began his great run of seasons with the franchise, returning 33 kicks for 998 yards, with a remarkable average of 30.2 yards per return - and one kick returned for a touchdown.\nAfter five seasons in Carolina, Bates was let go, and the Washington Redskins signed him to a 2-year, $1.33 million contract. At the end of the season he was named a Pro Bowl alternate. He was released on March 12, 2002. On March 25, he was signed by the Carolina Panthers. His season was cut short that year, however, due to a broken right ankle he suffered in preseason against the Dallas Cowboys and was placed on the injured reserve list on August 26.\nOn March 31, 2003, he re-signed with Carolina but was let go in the final cut-down process for the regular season on August 31. On September 10, Bates was signed by the New York Jets, but a right-hand injury placed him on the injured reserve list on November 11, and he was later released on December 23. On December 26, he was claimed off waivers by the Dallas Cowboys for their playoff run. He was not re-signed after the season.\nBates finished with 9,154 total yards in kick returns and five kick-return touchdowns (the NFL record for kickoff return touchdowns in a career is six). He was selected to the NFL 1990s All-Decade Team.\nPanthers franchise records.\n's NFL off-season, Michael Bates held at least 12 Panthers franchise records, including:\nPersonal life.\nHis brother Mario played for the Arizona Cardinals and was a second-round draft choice of the New Orleans Saints in 1992 from Arizona State.

Starting the season after that, championship series in import-laden conferences are in a best-of-seven format, while all-Filipino conferences are best-of-five. Starting in 1989, almost finals series are in a best-of-seven format, excluding special conferences like the 1998 PBA Centennial Cup, or if the PBA is forced to shorten the season, like during the 2013–14 season, where the last two conferences were made into best-of-five series to make way for the Philippine national team's participation in the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup and 2014 Asian Games.\nThe winning team is said to be the champions of the conference. After each season, there would be no playoffs in order to determine a \"season champion.\"\nHowever, the teams which are both boldfaced and italicized, the Crispa Redmanizers (1976 and 1983), the San Miguel Beermen (1989), the Alaska Milkmen (1996) and the San Mig Super Coffee Mixers (2013–14), hold the distinction of winning all three conferences in one season and have the distinction of winning the \"Grand Slam\". Winning the Grand Slam is the equivalent of the \"season championship,\" where the team is said to be the undisputed champion in the league.\nThe league previously holds a \"battle for third place\" playoff to determine the third-place team in a conference. This practice was abandoned beginning the 2010–11 season.\nChampions by season.\n2010–present.\nStarting from the 2010 season, the third-place playoff (popularly known as the \"battle for third\") was no longer held.\nChampionships by franchise.\nChampionships won from conferences shaded in gray above, such as Mobiline's 1998 Centennial Cup and Añejo's 1988 PBA-IBA Championship titles are not included in the table below.\nBold denotes active franchise\nChampionships by player.\nThe teams provided were the teams that the player were part of the championship roster.

There are three modes: \"Golf\", \"Normal\", and \"Practice\" where the player constructs their own scenarios and practices knocking down the bowling pins with either one or two balls.\nReception.\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the game a B and wrote that \"while it still doesn't rack up to the real thing, at least \"Super Bowl\" (for Super NES) has a sense of humor — an animated green chicken comments on the action, the on-screen players make funny faces when they throw gutter balls, and there's a 'golf ball' option that lets you alleviate bowling's inherent lack of excitement by assigning pars for different pin setups. Unlike The Blue Marlin or Side Pocket, Super Bowling offers at least one improvement over the real-life game: Scoring is completely automatic, meaning you don't need a degree in particle physics to tabulate two spares after a strike.\""

        "text": "Christopher Myers Jr. (born September 15, 1981) is an American former professional football player who was a center in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes, and was selected by the Denver Broncos in the sixth round of the 2005 NFL draft. He also played for the Houston Texans. He was a two-time Pro Bowl selection with the Texans.\nEarly years.\nMyers is a graduate of Miami Palmetto High School. Coming out of high school Myers was ranked the 47th best prospect in the state of Florida by SuperPrep. The Miami Herald also named him to the Class 6A-5A All-Dade first team.\nCollege career.\nMyers attended the University of Miami and was a part of some of the school's most successful teams during his time there. He red shirted during the 2000 season. In the 2001 national championship season Myers played as a reserve on the offensive line in seven games. During the 2002 season Myers became a starter at right guard. Myers was part of an offensive line that protected and blocked for Heisman Trophy finalist Ken Dorsey. Myers was also part of an offensive line that paved the way for Willis McGahee who enjoyed a breakout season in 2002. McGahee rushed for 1,753 yards in 2002 and led the NCAA in rushing touchdowns with 28. Like Dorsey, McGahee was additionally a Heisman finalist. The offensive line that season only allowed 11 sacks and Myers was only personally responsible for one of those sacks. The line also blocked for a running game that averaged 183 yards per game.\nDuring the 2003 season Myers once again started at right guard, however towards the end of the season he started three games at center. His efforts were good enough for him to be named to the All Big East second team. Once again Myers only gave up one sack and led the offensive line in least sacks given up. With McGahee gone the Hurricanes used a stable of three running backs in the 2003 season. Jarrett Payton, Tyrone Moss, and Frank Gore collectively rushed for 1,964 yards and the Miami rushing attack was ranked 33rd in the nation.\nAs a senior in 2004 Myers switched positions and became the starter at right tackle.\nProfessional career.\nDenver Broncos.\nMeyers was drafted by the Denver Broncos in the 2005 NFL draft in the sixth round, 200th overall.\nIn the 2007 season, Myers showed his versatility by starting the season as an offensive guard before shifting to center, replacing an injured Tom Nalen.\nHouston Texans.\nA restricted free agent in the 2008 offseason, Myers was involved in a sign-and-trade on March 17. The Broncos signed him to a four-year, $11 million contract with $3 million guaranteed and then traded him to the Houston Texans in exchange for a sixth-round pick in the 2008 NFL draft. While with the Texans, Myers' play at center was one of the biggest reasons for teammate Arian Foster's success at running back. As the starting center for the Texans in 2010, he anchored an offensive line that helped Foster lead the league in rushing. In 2011, the Texans had the second ranked rushing attack in the league and made their first playoff appearance in the franchise's history. After the 2011 season, Myers was rewarded with a four-year, $25 million contract. On March 4, 2015 Myers was released by the Texans.\nOn August 25, 2015, Myers announced his retirement from the league on In The Loop with Nick &amp; Lopez on SportsRadio 610.\nHe joined the staff of the Texans flagship, SportsRadio 610, a few weeks before his announcement."

The present Staffordshire county club was founded on 24 November 1871 and took part in the first Minor Counties Championship in 1895. Membership then lapsed for four years as the club could not arrange sufficient fixtures, but it has been a member continuously since 1900.\nStaffordshire has won the Minor/National Counties Championship 11 times, more than any other county.

The 1914 title was disputed as the war prevented several matches from being played, and is regarded by the NCCA as void. Staffordshire's years of great success before and after the First World War were in part due to the great bowler, Sydney Barnes, who played for the county from 1904 to 1914 and from 1924 to 1934 (when he was 61). He took 1,441 wickets at an average of 8.15 runs each. However, Barnes did not play for the county in 1920 or 1921, two of Staffordshire's title-winning seasons. The leading player then was Aaron Lockett. The most recent title in 2014 was won after a play-off final against the Western Division league leaders, Wiltshire, at the South Wilts Sports Club ground in Salisbury. Staffordshire has won the NCCA Knockout Trophy twice (1991 and 1993) since its inception in 1983.\nCounty grounds.\nThe club has always played its matches at club grounds around the county.

It represents all of the historic counties of Wales except Glamorgan, and is the only non-English team in the competition. \nThe team is currently a member of the National Counties Cricket Championship Western Division, having joined in 1988 (under the name Wales Minor Counties) after Somerset's second eleven left the competition, and plays in the NCCA Knockout Trophy. Wales National County played List A matches occasionally from 1993 until 2005 but is not classified as a List A team \"per se\".\nClub history.\nSome Welsh counties formerly competed individually in the National Counties Cricket Championship. Glamorgan was easily the most successful and it became first-class in 1921. The others were Carmarthenshire from 1908 to 1911; Denbighshire from 1930 to 1935; and Monmouthshire from 1901 to 1934.\nFollowing the withdrawal of the Somerset Second XI from National Counties cricket at the end of the 1987 season, Wales Minor Counties entered National Counties cricket for the 1988 season as their replacement. Wales National County is yet to win the National Counties Cricket Championship or the NCCA Knockout Trophy.\nThe club first played List A cricket in the 1993 NatWest Trophy against Sussex. The club appeared in eighteen List A matches from 1993 to 2005, winning eight and losing ten, the majority of which were against first-class opponents. Wales National County lost the right to play List A cricket when the National Counties were excluded from the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy from the 2006 season onward.\nNotable players.\nThe following Wales Minor Counties/National County cricketers also made an impact on the first-class game or are of note in other fields:\nGrounds.\nThe club has no fixed home, but plays its home matches at various grounds across Wales. Grounds used for the 2011 season included:"

        "text": "The 1997–98 UEFA Champions League was the 43rd season of the UEFA Champions League, UEFA's premier club football tournament, and the sixth since its re-branding from the \"European Champion Clubs' Cup\" or \"European Cup\". The tournament was won by Real Madrid, winning for the first time in 32 years, beating 1–0 Juventus who were playing in a third consecutive final. It started a run of three victories in five seasons for the Spanish club.\nThis season was the first to have six groups, instead of previous four, which meant that only two group runners-up qualified for the quarter-finals as opposed to all the second-placed teams. It was also the first to have two qualifying rounds instead of just one. After three years of entering the UEFA Cup, champions of smaller nations returned to the Champions League. For the first time, the runners-up of eight domestic leagues entered into the competition. With Borussia Dortmund being the title holders but finishing third in their domestic league the previous season, Germany became the first association to provide three teams to the premier European competition.\nBorussia Dortmund, the defending champions, were eliminated in the semi-finals by eventual winners Real Madrid.\nArmenia, Azerbaijan, Slovakia and the Republic of Macedonia all entered their champions for the first time, while the champion of Yugoslavia returned to this competition for the first time since 1991–92 season after the UN ban was lifted.\nAssociation team allocation.\nNumber of teams per country as well as the starting round for each club and seeding were based on 1997 UEFA league coefficient, which takes into account their performance in European competitions from 1992–93 to 1996–97.\nTeams.\n55 teams entered the competition: the national champions of each of the top 48 nations in the UEFA coefficient rankings (except Liechtenstein and Albania), plus the runners-up from each of the top eight nations and UEFA Champions League holders, Borussia Dortmund. The national champions of the associations ranked 1–7 (Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal and England), plus the title holders, all received a bye to the group stage, while the national champions of the associations ranked 8–16 and the runners-up of the associations ranked 1–8 all entered in the second qualifying round. The remaining national champions from the associations ranked 17–48 entered in the first qualifying round.\nRound and draw dates.\nThe schedule of the competition is as follows (all draws are held in Geneva, Switzerland, unless stated otherwise).\nQualifying rounds.\nSecond qualifying round.\nLosing teams qualified for the first round of the 1997–98 UEFA Cup.\nNote: Winning teams of the first qualifying round were drawn against teams qualified directly for the second qualifying round. Because of the unequal number of teams (15 and 17), Wüstenrot Salzburg and Sparta Prague had to play against each other.\nGroup stage.\nBayer Leverkusen, Beşiktaş, Košice, Feyenoord, Lierse, Newcastle United, Olympiacos, Parma, Sparta Prague (who already qualified for the 1991-92 European Cup group stage) and Sporting CP made their debut in the group stage. Košice lost all six of their group stage matches and thus became the first team to finish a Champions League group stage with no points. They were also first team from Slovakia to play in group stage.\nKnockout stage.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-final between German clubs Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund marked the first meeting of two teams from the same country in the Champions League (including the European Cup era, the first game between teams from the same country occurred in 1958–59). With Bayer Leverkusen also having qualified, it marked the first time three clubs from the same nation played in the knockout phase."

        "text": "The Pacific Nations Cup is an international rugby union competition held between three Pacific states: Fiji, Samoa and Tonga. The 2019 edition of the tournament also included the national teams of Canada, Japan and United States. First held in 2006, the tournament is intended to strengthen the Tier 2 rugby teams by providing competitive test matches in a tournament format.\nPreviously, Japan participated from 2006 to 2015, New Zealand from 2006 to 2009, Australia from 2007 to 2008, and Canada and the United States from 2013 to 2015. The inaugural tournament was the only one that carried the title of IRB Pacific 5 Nations; from 2007 the competition was known as the IRB Pacific Nations Cup.\nFormat.\nThe tournament is a round-robin, where each team plays one match against each of the other teams. There are four points for a win, two points for a draw and none for a defeat. There are also bonus points offered with one bonus point for scoring four or more tries in a match and one bonus point for losing by 7 points or fewer.\nThe tournament generally occurs every year in the June mid-year international test window. The tournament was played mainly throughout June, with the last round in early July. The revised tournament begins in May due to pre-existing Test commitments and concludes in late June.\nHistory.\nThe Pacific Nations Cup was funded as an International Rugby Board (IRB) tournament which was part of the $US50 million, three-year, global strategic investment programme launched in August 2005. The competition was aimed at developing the Pacific rim sides in the second tier of the rugby countries: Fiji, Japan, Samoa and Tonga. The Junior All Blacks were also invited to compete, who are New Zealand's second XV. \"The IRB Pacific 5 Nations is a tournament that will provide more certainty for Fiji, Japan, Samoa and Tonga in terms of regular high level Test match rugby, while also providing a high level of competition for the Junior All Blacks,\" said Mark Egan, the IRB's Head of Rugby Services.\nIn the first year only it was called the IRB Pacific 5 Nations and did not include Australia. Australia had been invited to take part in the inaugural 2006 tournament but decided against sending a team stating that they wanted to focus on their domestic competition. The inaugural tournament kicked off 3 June 2006 and was played in a round-robin format, with some games being held in Australia. The Junior All Blacks won all of their matches en route to winning the 2006 tournament. The inaugural tournament was a success in providing a platform for Pacific states and Japan in gaining valuable exposure.\nAustralia A joined an expanded competition for the 2007 season. The inclusion of Australia A meant that the tier 2 teams would have an even greater number of matches in the buildup to the 2007 Rugby World Cup. For Australia, it provided a stepping stone for Wallaby selection. Following the 2008 tournament, however, the ARU announced Australia A would not play in 2009 due to the current economic environment. Australia has not participated since then.\nIn 2008, the New Zealand Māori team replaced the Junior All Blacks in the competition. The New Zealand Rugby Union had decided that the New Zealand Māori needed to play more matches at home and that the Junior All Blacks would not be assembled in 2008 for reasons of \"player welfare.\" The Junior All Blacks returned for the 2009 tournament, but no New Zealand team has participated since then.\nFrom 2010 to 2012, the Pacific Nations Cup was a four-team tournament, contested by Japan, Fiji, Samoa and Tonga, with Samoa winning in 2010 and 2012, and Japan winning in 2011.\nIn January 2013, the IRB announced that both the USA and Canadian rugby teams would be joining the 2013 competition on a permanent basis. For the first time, the reigning champion Samoan team did not compete as they took part in a competition in South Africa.\nThe World Rugby Pacific Nations Cup was downscaled for 2016 and 2017 with these two editions featuring only Fiji, Samoa and Tonga. The sides from Canada, Japan and United States played in their respective regional qualifiers for the 2019 Rugby World Cup. As part of the Oceanian qualification, places at the 2019 Rugby World Cup were awarded to the two top teams of the 2016 and 2017 PNC (on aggregate), whereas the bottom team played a repechage match against the second best Rugby Europe Championship team. was invited for the 2018 tournament hosted in Suva.\nFor 2019, Canada, Japan and the United States returned to the tournament, serving as a prelude to the 2019 Rugby World Cup. Japan won without losing a match.\nThe tournament was not held in 2020 or 2021. It was revived in 2022, with the ever-present Fiji, Samoa and Tonga being joined by Australia A. Samoa won all three matches, ahead of Australia A. The 2023 version saw Australia A replaced by Japan: Fiji won the championship this time, ahead of Samoa who narrowly edged out Japan for second place.\nOn 24 October 2023, World Rugby announced that the 2024 edition will feature six teams: Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Japan, Canada and the United States.\nTeams.\n2006–2023.\nThe teams in the Pacific Nations Cup and their finishing positions are as follows:\n2024–present.\nThe teams in the Pacific Nations Cup from the 2024 season change and their finishing positions, with the Finals Series hosts with a red border, are as follows:\nNotes:\n The 2014 tournament was split into conferences without crossover matches or finals.

        "text": "James Joseph Phelan (March 19, 1929 – June 15, 2021) was an American college basketball coach. He is best known for his 49-year coaching career at Mount Saint Mary's University. Phelan was a 1951 graduate of La Salle University and played one season for the Philadelphia Warriors of the NBA. He was famous for wearing a bow tie on the sidelines.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Philadelphia, Phelan graduated from La Salle College High School in 1947 and La Salle University in 1951. From 1951 to 1953, during the Korean War, Phelan served in the United States Marine Corps.\nProfessional playing career.\nSelected in the eighth round (77th overall) in the 1951 NBA draft, Phelan played in four games as a reserve for the Philadelphia Warriors in 1953. He then played for the Pottstown Packers in the Eastern League.\nCoaching career.\nPhelan coached his entire career at Mount St. Mary's University. He led the Mountaineers to the 1962 NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Championship as well as 14 NCAA Division II tournaments and five Final Four appearances. When he retired in 2003, after coaching for 49 years, he had amassed 830 wins (overall record of 830-524) in over 1,300 games in all divisions. In those 49 years, Phelan had 19 teams that reached 20 or more wins in a season. Prior to the announcement of his induction to the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in April 2008, Phelan was often noted for having the most victories of any coach not in the Hall of Fame.\nOn February 17, 1986, Phelan earned his 600th win as Mount St. Mary’s head coach.\nPhelan got his 800th win in the Northeast Conference Championship Game on March 1, 1999. He became just the fourth coach in NCAA history to get 800 career wins; currently he sits 14th on the all-time list. On January 19, 1998, he became just the second coach in NCAA history to coach in 1,200 career games. The only other coach to do so prior was Clarence Gaines. Phelan held the record in games coached with 1,354 across all NCAA divisions and is currently fourth on the all-time list; he is behind Phog Allen and tied with Jim Smith for second place in total career seasons coached with 49, though all 49 of Phelan's and Smith's seasons came at one school while Allen coached at four other institutions besides Kansas, where he gained fame.\nPlayers coached.\nNotable players that Phelan coached include Fred \"Mad Dog\" Carter, Jack Sullivan, and Jon O'Reilly. The 1962 team won the school's only national championship. Phelan earned his first of two coach of the year awards in '62. In the book, \"King of the Mount: The Jim Phelan Story\", the 1980-1981 season is a highlight.\nAcknowledgments.\nCollegeinsider.com, in 2003, renamed its coach of year award the \"Jim Phelan National Coach of the Year Award\".\nMount Saint Mary's University has also renamed its court \"Jim Phelan Court\", complete with his years coached and his signature bow tie painted on each end of the court. A new banner was also revealed in the ARCC Arena (MSMU's home court) with a Phelan bow tie and signifying his 830 wins.\nThe Northeast Conference Coach of the Year award is named after Jim Phelan.\nIn November 2008, Phelan was inducted into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in Kansas City, MO. Other members of his induction class included Nolan Richardson (former coach at the University of Arkansas), Charles Barkley (former Auburn player and NBA veteran), and commentators Billy Packer and Dick Vitale. Phelan said of his induction, \"It is an honor to be selected for induction. It's a great feeling to be in such a distinguished group of gentlemen.\"\nPersonal life.\nPhelan and his wife Dottie had five children (Jim, Lynne, Carol, Larry, and Bobby) and ten grandchildren. \nPhelan died on June 15, 2021, at the age of 92 at his home in Emmitsburg.\nCareer playing statistics.\nNBA.\nSource"

        "text": "The Big East men's basketball tournament is the championship tournament of the Big East Conference in men's basketball. The winner receives the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship.\nAs part of the 2013 deal in which seven schools left the original Big East Conference of 1979–2013 to form a new Big East Conference and the original conference became the American Athletic Conference, the new Big East retained the rights to the conference tournament.\nVenue.\nSince 1983, the tournament has been held in Madison Square Garden, New York City. As such, the tournament is the longest-running conference tournament at any one site in all of college basketball. Madison Square Garden has a contract with the Big East Conference to host the tournament through 2028.\nNotable events.\nThe 2009 tournament featured a six-overtime game in the quarterfinals between the Connecticut Huskies and the Syracuse Orange, in which Syracuse prevailed, 127–117. The game, the second-longest in NCAA history, started on the evening of March 12 and ended nearly four hours later in the early morning of March 13.\nIn 2011, Connecticut, led by Kemba Walker, became the first and only team in the Big East tournament ever to win five games in five consecutive days to win the championship.\nOn March 12, 2020, the 2020 tournament was cancelled during halftime of a first-round game due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The conference received an insurance payout of $10.5 million as a result of the tournament's cancellation.\nIn 2021, Georgetown won four games in four days as an underdog in each contest, to win its record eighth title. Patrick Ewing became the first person to win the championship as both a player and a head coach.\nOnly three players have achieved repeat Most Valuable Player honors: Georgetown's Patrick Ewing (1984–1985), Louisville's Peyton Siva (2012–2013), and Villanova's Josh Hart (2015, 2017).\nSeeding.\nFrom 1980 through 2000, all Big East member schools qualified for the Big East tournament. The Big East limited participation to 12 schools from 2001 to 2008, but since 2009, all member schools again have qualified for the tournament. The conference has based tournament seeding strictly on conference record and tiebreakers except between 1996 and 1998 and between 2001 and 2003; during those years, the conference used a divisional structure which also affected seeding.\n1980–1995.\nIn 1980, with seven member schools, the #2 through #7 seeds played in an opening quarterfinal round and the #1 seed received a bye until the semifinal round. In 1981, the conference expanded to eight teams, and in 1981 and 1982, all eight teams began play in a quarterfinal round. After the conference expanded again, to nine teams, the #8 and #9 seeds played in a single first-round game and schools seeded #7 or higher received a bye into the quarterfinal round; adopted in 1983, this format persisted through the 1991 tournament. After the Big East expanded to 10 teams, the 1992 tournament had two first-round games for the #7 through #10 seeds, teams seeded #6 or higher getting a bye into the quarterfinal round. This format continued through the 1995 tournament.\n1996–2000.\nFor the 1995–96 Big East Conference men's basketball season, the Big East expanded to 13 teams and adopted a divisional structure, with teams divided between the Big East 6 Division and the Big East 7 Division. The expansion resulted in a new tournament format in which the #4 through #13 seeds played in the first round and only the #1 through #3 seeds received byes into the quarterfinals. This format lasted through the 2000 tournament.\nDuring the existence of the Big East 6 and Big East 7 divisions, seeding criteria also changed, with the winners of each division receiving the #1 and #2 seeds regardless of record, the second-place team with the best record receiving the #3 seed, and the rest of the schools receiving the #4 through #13 seeds based on conference record and tiebreakers. After 1998, the Big East scrapped the divisions and returned to a unitary conference structure, and tournament seeding again was based strictly on conference record and tiebreakers in 1999 and 2000.\n2001–2008.\nFrom 2001 through 2008, Big East membership varied between 13 and 16 schools, but the conference limited tournament participation to 12 schools.\nFrom 2001 through 2003, when the Big East again was divided into two divisions — an East and a West Division, each of seven teams — teams were seeded #1 through #6 by division. The third- through sixth-place finishers in each division (a total of eight teams) received the #3 through #6 seeds in each division and played in the first round, with the #3 East seed playing the #6 West seed, the #4 East seed playing the #5 West seed, the #5 East seed playing the #4 West seed, and the #6 East seed playing the #3 West seed. The first- and second-place finishers in each division (a total of four teams) received the #1 and #2 divisional seeds and a bye into the quarterfinal round. Two teams — the seventh-place finishers in each division, after the application of any necessary tiebreaking criteria — did not qualify for the tournament.\nFrom 2004 to 2008, after the Big East again eliminated its division structure, schools again were seeded based on conference record and tiebreakers. The #5 through #12 seeds played in the first round, and the #1 through #4 seeds received byes into the quarterfinal round. The Big East's membership varied between 13 and 16 schools during these years, but only the teams which finished 12th or higher in the conference after the application as necessary of tiebreaking criteria qualified for the tournament.\n2009–2013.\nIn 2009, the conference returned to a tournament format that included all member schools (16 from 2009 to 2012, and 14 in 2013). The teams seeded #9 through #16 played first-round games, teams seeded #5 through #8 received a bye to the second round, and the top four teams received a double-bye to the quarterfinals. The final Big East tournament held by the original Big East Conference, which took place in 2013, saw only 14 teams compete—West Virginia had left the Big East for the Big 12 Conference after the 2011–12 season, and Connecticut was barred from the tournament due to an NCAA postseason ban for academic reasons. In that tournament, the teams seeded #11 through #14 played in the first round, with byes remaining the same as in the 2010–2012 period.\nThroughout the 2009–2013 period, all member schools participating in the tournament were seeded in the tournament based on their conference records. Non-conference games were ignored. Ties were broken using an elaborate set of tiebreaker rules, with the first two tiebreakers being head-to-head record and common record against the next-best conference team.\n2014–present.\nDuring the offseason in 2013, seven schools left the original Big East Conference of 1979–2013 and joined three other schools in forming a new Big East Conference, the old conference becoming the American Athletic Conference. The new Big East Conference took over control of the Big East tournament. From 2014 — the first tournament held after the formation of the new Big East — through 2019 all 10 member schools took part in the tournament, with tiebreakers similar to those used prior to the formation of the new conference employed as needed. The #7 through #10 seeds played in two first-round games, and all schools seeded #6 or higher received a bye into the quarterfinal round. The 2020 tournament would have followed the same format if it had not been canceled after the first round.\nIn 2021, after the Big East expanded to 11 teams with Connecticut's move to the Big East from the American Athletic Conference, the Big East tournament adopted an 11-team format in which the #6 through #11 seeds play in three first-round games and teams seeded #5 or higher receive a bye into the quarterfinal round.\nChampionships by school.\nCurrent members Butler and DePaul have yet to make an appearance in the Big East Championship Game. Former members Miami, Notre Dame, Virginia Tech, Rutgers, and South Florida did not appear in the championship during their respective conference tenures.\nPerformance by team.\nSince 2014 realignment.\nKey\nTelevision coverage.\nBefore the 2013 conference split, the Big East was the only conference to have every tournament game broadcast nationwide on the ESPN family of networks, with every game from the second round forward broadcast on ESPN. 2011 marked the first year the tournament was broadcast in 3D on ESPN 3D.\nBeginning with the 2014 tournament, FS1 is the television home for the Big East tournament."

The Big Ten was one of the last NCAA Division I college basketball conferences to start a tournament.\nThe finals of the tournament are typically held immediately before the field for the NCAA Tournament is announced, although in 2018 it was held the week before Selection Sunday.\nOn seven occasions, the champion of the tournament has gone on to reach the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament (Michigan State in 1999, 2000, and 2019, Illinois in 2005, Ohio State in 2007, Wisconsin in 2015, and Michigan in 2018). In 2000, champion Michigan State won the NCAA tournament. The No. 1 seed has won the tournament ten times, the most of any seed. The lowest seed to win the tournament was Michigan as a No. 8 seed in 2017. Three schools have won two consecutive championships: Michigan State (1999, 2000), Ohio State (2010, 2011), and Michigan (2017, 2018).\nHost.\nThe Big Ten Men's Basketball tournaments have been held at neutral sites every year.

The 2019 through 2022 Tournaments returned to alternating between United Center in Chicago and Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. On February 9, 2021, it was announced that the 2021 edition of the tournament would be moved to Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis due to health and safety protocols relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tournament returned to Chicago in 2023. On April 20, 2022, the Big Ten announced that Minneapolis will host the event in 2024 at the Target Center.\nVacated results.\nDue to various rulings against participating programs, some of the results of the Big Ten tournament have been vacated or voided.

He has spent five seasons ranked among the game's elite Top 16 and fifteen in the Top 32, reaching a career-high of number ten in the world in the 1999/2000 season. Hamilton is a four-time World Championship quarter-finalist,\na Masters semi-finalist and he has compiled more than 300 century breaks during his long career. He won his first ranking title in 2017, beating Ali Carter 9–6 in the final of the German Masters, doing so at the age of 45.\nCareer.\n1991–2000.\nHamilton turned professional in 1991, entering the world's top 32 in 1995/1996. Hamilton has reached two ranking tournament finals. In the British Open in 1999, where he lost to Fergal O'Brien, Hamilton opened with two centuries, but O'Brien won five frames on the final black to defeat the Nottingham man. The other was the 2001 China Open. Mark Williams beat him 9–8, despite Hamilton having led 8–5. He made the first of his four World Championship quarter-finals in 2000, losing 3–13 to John Higgins.\n2000–2006.\nHe reached the quarter-finals of the World Championship on three later occasions (2002, 2004 and 2007), but without reaching the semi-final stage. In 2002, he lost 6–13 to eventual winner Peter Ebdon. In 2004, he made two consecutive to come from 0–2 down to level at 2–2 in his quarter-final against eventual champion Ronnie O'Sullivan, but eventually lost the match by 3–13. Hamilton's 438 points scored in this match are a record low for a World Championship Quarter-final. He also has the highest ever points total in a first-round match at the Crucible, 1271 against Chris Small in 1999, though he lost this match 9–10. In 1997 he reached the second round; facing John Parrott at this stage he scored 414 unanswered points in frames 1–5, but still lost the match (this is the second-highest number of unanswered points in Crucible history; the record was set by John Higgins against Hamilton in the second round in 2000). Hamilton did not fare well in the 2006 World Championship, losing 1–10 in the opening round to Mark Williams. However, a strong two seasons ensured that he reclaimed a top 16 place.\n2006–2007.\nHamilton began the 2006–07 season at the Northern Ireland Trophy, losing 3–5 against Ding Junhui. At the Grand Prix Hamilton lost all five of his group stage matches, and didn't advance to the knockout stage. Hamilton then lost 7–9 against Rod Lawler in the first round of the UK Championship, 3–6 in the wild-card round of the Masters, 4–5 against Tom Ford in the first round of the Malta Cup. Hamilton's best result of the season came at the Welsh Open, where he reached the quarter-finals by defeating both Joe Perry and Dave Harold, before losing his match to Steve Davis in a final- decider. Hamilton then lost in the first round of the China Open 4–5 against Mark Selby. Hamilton reached his fourth World Championship quarter-final, pulling off a surprise 10–3 victory over Marco Fu in round 1, and a 13–8 second round win over Ian McCulloch. However, he couldn't advance to the semi-final stage, losing 7–13 to Stephen Maguire. As a result, he did not retain his top sixteen place, falling to number 26 in the rankings for 2007/2008.\n2007–2008.\nHamilton began the 2007–08 season at the Shanghai Masters, where he lost 4–5 against Adrian Gunnell in the last qualifying round. Hamilton than was eliminated in the round robin stages of the Grand Prix, as he won only two of his five matches.

He ensured his qualification for the World Championship with a 10–2 victory over Scott MacKenzie in the final qualifying round, but lost 3–10 to Stephen Maguire in the first round. This saw him drop from number 26 to 31 in the World Rankings at the start of the 2008/2009 season.\nIn 2008–09 Hamilton did not reach the last sixteen in any of the first five ranking events. He lost in the first round 3–5 against Andrew Higginson at the Northern Ireland Trophy, 2–5 against Marco Fu at the Shanghai Masters, and 0–5 against John Higgins at the Grand Prix, while he could not qualify for the Bahrain Championship and the UK Championship, as he lost in the qualifying round 2–5 against Mark Davis and 4–9 against Higginson respectively.

He failed to qualify for the Shanghai Masters and International Championship, but knocked out Craig Steadman 6–5 in the first round of the UK Championship, despite Hamilton being docked a frame for arriving late. Hamilton said afterwards, \"It was rubbish - seriously. I can't play any worse. It was a good attitude but rubbish snooker. I am rubbish now a lot of the time. I am getting old basically. It's no fun but it's better than working\". He reiterated these sentiments after he lost 6–4 to Graeme Dott in the second round stating, \"I don't practice much anymore. I only play because it is better than working. I will have to work for a long time so I just want to swerve it for as long as possible\". Hamilton qualified for the Indian Open and China Open, but was eliminated in the first round of both. He was knocked out in the last 64 of every European Tour to finish 54th on the Order of Merit and 58th in the world rankings.\n2015–2016.\nHamilton began the 2015/2016 season at risk of losing his tour place if his performances were not good enough; despite this, the results proved hard to come by during the first half of the season, with the last 32 appearance at the minor-ranking Event 5 of the European Tour being his best result. Hamilton's form improved slightly after the New Year. In the first round of the Welsh Open he eliminated the reigning world champion Stuart Bingham 4–1. having produced a break of 72 from 0–71 down to take the final frame. He defeated Allan Taylor 4–2, before losing 4–3 to Ben Woollaston in the third round. In the 2016 China Open qualifiers, Hamilton was involved in a high-quality match with Kyren Wilson, in which the two players set a record of six consecutive century breaks between them; this included two from Hamilton, but he was beaten 5–3. Hamilton finished his season by reaching the final qualifying round for the World Championship, but was edged out 10–9 by Robbie Williams for the Crucible place. Hamilton finished the year 71st in the world rankings and therefore outside of the top 64 for the first time since 1992; however, thanks to being placed 64th on the European Order of Merit (one of the eight highest-placed players not in the world top 64), he earned a fresh two-year tour card.\n2016–2017: Resurgence and first ranking title.\nHamilton reached the quarter-finals of the English Open by beating Jak Jones 4–3, but lost 5–2 to Liang Wenbo. He also got to the quarter-finals of the next Home Nations event, the Northern Ireland Open and he defeated local favourite Mark Allen 5–2 to make his first semi-final since the 2009 Welsh Open. After the match, Hamilton said \"a month ago I was skint and now I'm in the semi-finals.\" In the semi-final he came from 4–2 and 5–3 down against Barry Hawkins to force a deciding frame in which he had a good chance to win the match, but he feathered the cue ball and Hawkins secured it with a 59 break.\nHamilton came through a very tough draw at the German Masters as he beat Mark Williams 5–3, Mark Selby 5–2 and Barry Hawkins 5–4 to advance to the semi-finals whilst claiming he wasn't playing his best. He then defeated Stuart Bingham 6–4 to get to his third ranking event final and first in 15 years in a match that finished at 1am. Playing Ali Carter in the final, Hamilton fell 2–5 down early on, but went on to win seven of the last eight frames for a 9–6 victory. It sealed the long-awaited first ranking event title of his 26-year career as a professional, and at the age of 45, he also became the oldest winner of a ranking event since 46-year-old Doug Mountjoy in 1989. Hamilton moved from 66th to 38th in the rankings. He beat Bingham 5–1, before losing 5–2 to Ding Junhui at the Players Championship and failed to reach the World Championship as he was defeated 10–9 by Noppon Saengkham in the second qualifying round. From starting the season with no ranking points he finished it 25th in the world, 31 places ahead of the next newly qualified player, Yan Bingtao.\n2019–2020.\nHamilton beat Sam Craigie 6–3 and Scott Donaldson 10–5 to qualify for the 2020 World Championship but then withdrew from the tournament. Being an asthmatic, Hamilton had criticised the decision to allow a limited number of spectators into the Crucible in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. Defending champion Judd Trump said Hamilton should have made his decision earlier because, by participating in the qualifiers despite knowing there would be spectators in the final stages, he had denied a place to another player. This was despite government advice changing after qualifying entries had been announced.\nPersonal life.\nHe is nicknamed the \"Sheriff of Pottingham\", \"Swampy\" and \"The Robin Hood of Snooker\". He now lives in Nottingham, and regularly plays at Spot On Leisure in Hucknall, Nottingham. In 2001 he suffered a broken wrist while attempting to come to the rescue of a friend who was mugged in a nightclub, an injury which kept him out of three tournaments and ultimately cost him his place in the top 16 of the 2001/2002 season."

The first tournament was held in 1982 with Queen Elizabeth High School of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada winning the cup. A major facilitating factor is that all team members are housed within one wing of the school. Breton Education Centre is a combined middle school and high school which opened in 1970.\nThe tournament, first held in 1982, takes its name from the former primary industry of New Waterford, coal mining. Coal mining employed thousands of men and was the main industry on the Island for over 100 years. All the mines on the island were closed in the 1980s and 90s. However Kameron Coal Ltd opened a coal mine in Donkin ( just outside Glace Bay) in 2017.\nThe tournament held in February in the year of 2020 will be the Coal Bowl Classic's 38th year."

        "text": "Johnny Johnson, Jr. (born June 11, 1968) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL) for the New York Jets and the Phoenix Cardinals between 1990 and 1994. He played college football for the San Jose State Spartans.\nHigh school and college.\nHe prepped at Santa Cruz High School. Johnson attended and graduated from San Jose State University. For the San Jose State Spartans basketball team, Johnson played 12 games as a basketball player after most team members walked off and refused to play under coach Bill Berry. With 1,219 yards rushing and 61 catches in receiving, Johnson was considered among the top 20 college football players in the United States in 1988. After five games into his senior season, Johnson was dismissed from the team for missing practices and team meetings. Johnson's reasoning for missing practices was to help take care of his mother in the aftermath of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, but because telephone lines were down across the area, there wasn't much of a way for Johnson to communicate to his head coach Claude Gilbert. Gilbert however claimed that Johnson had already skipped 2 o'clock practice anyway to attend game 3 of the 1989 World Series. Nevertheless, his dismissal from the Spartans football program dropped Johnson's draft stock all the way to the 169th pick in the 1990 NFL Draft by the Phoenix Cardinals.\nProfessional career.\nJohnson played in the 1991 Pro Bowl. After playing for three seasons for the Cardinals, he was traded during the 1993 NFL Draft to the New York Jets, in exchange for the Cardinals moving from the number 4 pick in the draft to the Jets' number 3 draft position. The Cardinals badly wanted Garrison Hearst, who also played running back, so the Cardinals were willing to part with Johnson just to move up one draft spot.\nAfter arriving on the Jets, Johnny Johnson was named Jets team MVP in 1993 in a vote by his teammates. Johnson finished the season ranked second in the AFC in total yards from scrimmage. He was one of only two backs to lead his team in rushing and receptions.\nHe became a free agent in 1995, and the Jets made him available for the expansion draft that year. Johnson considered signing with the San Francisco 49ers. In April 1996, Johnson signed a two-year, $3-million contract with the 49ers; consequently, the 49ers waived Dennis Brown to make salary cap room for Johnson."

        "text": "Norfolk County Cricket Club is one of twenty minor county cricket clubs within the domestic cricket structure of England and Wales. It represents the historic county of Norfolk.\nThe team is currently a member of the National Counties Championship Eastern Division and plays in the Championship, the NCCA Knockout Trophy and, from 2018, in the NCCA T20 competition. Norfolk took part in limited overs competitions which included first-class counties between 1965 and 2004. The club's main home venue is Manor Park, Horsford to the north of Norwich, although it has used other locations throughout the county.\nHistory.\nCricket may have reached Norfolk by the end of the 17th century. The earliest reference to cricket in the county is dated 1745. The first county match played by the team was Norfolk v Suffolk at Bury St Edmunds Race Course on Thursday 23 August 1764, which was won by Norfolk. This was reported in the \"Gazetteer &amp; London Daily Advertiser\" on Tuesday 28 August. More games against Suffolk followed.\nA number of teams representing the county existed in the 18th and 19th centuries. The present club was founded on 14 October 1876 and played its first matches in 1877. The county joined the Minor Counties Championship when it was formed in 1895. It missed the 1896 season, and also did not compete in 1902 and 1903, but otherwise has remained at that level ever since.\nHonours.\nNorfolk has won the Minor Counties Championship five times, two of them shared. It won the first Championship in 1895, sharing with Durham and Worcestershire. It won outright in 1905, 1910 and 1913. Its most recent success was a shared title with Herefordshire in 2002. Norfolk has won the MCCA Knockout Trophy a record five times since its inception in 1983, winning in 1986, 1997, 2001, 2005 and 2009.\nGrounds.\nNorfolk's main ground since 2001 has been Manor Park, Horsford on the northern fringes of Norwich. Prior to this the County Ground, Lakenham close to the centre of the city had been used. This was redeveloped for housing in the early 21st century and the cricket pitch and historic pavilion destroyed. The club has played home matches on nine other grounds within the county.\nNotable players.\nPlayers who represented Norfolk and who have subsequently gone on to play over 100 first-class matches or Test cricket include:\nFormer Test Match Special commentator Henry Blofeld played one List A match and 44 times in minor counties competitions for Norfolk between 1956 and 1965."

        "text": "Devon County Cricket Club (Devon Cricket) is one of 20 minor county clubs within the domestic cricket structure of England and Wales. It represents the historic county of Devon.\nThe team is currently a member of the National Counties Championship Western Division Two and plays in the NCCA Knockout Trophy. Devon played List A matches occasionally from 1969 until 2005 but is not classified as a List A team 'per se'.\nThe Western Division Two of the National Counties Championship is made up of five teams with each team playing the others in three-day fixtures throughout the season. Devon also play in the 50-overs-a-side MCCA Knock Out Trophy. The county has an outstanding record in both the Championship and the one-day knockout trophy, which it has won five times, most recently in 2014.\nThe National Counties Championship is based on matches of two innings per side over three days. Counties are arranged into two geographical groups of ten – Eastern and Western sections – and sub-divided into divisions one and two with promotion and relegation between them.\nAt the end of the season, the team with the best record from the Eastern Division One plays the winner of the Western Division One for the National Counties Championship, over four days.\nThe NCCA Trophy is a 50-overs-a-side competition in which all teams initially play in a different group of five sides, organised geographically. The winner and runner-up in each of the four groups play in a series of knockout stages, culminating in a final.\nHistory.\nEarliest cricket.\nThe earliest reference to cricket in the county dates from the 1790s. An embryo county organization existed in the 1820s, and a county club was initially founded in 1861. It went out of existence briefly in 1897 but was re-formed on 26 November 1899, and joined the Minor Counties’ Championship in 1901. At present twenty Minor Counties participate in three competitions.\nDevon was the scene of a county club's foundation on 18 August 1875, but not its own. Somerset County Cricket Club was set up by some Somerset Gentlemen players at a meeting at Sidmouth CC, immediately after a match against the Gentlemen of Devon.\nAn application was made for first-class status and entry to the County Championship in 1948. However, the county was turned down. Devon has won the Minor Counties Championship eight times, one of them shared. It first won it in 1978 when Barrie Matthews was captain, and then under the captaincy of Peter Roebuck, it won for four consecutive years from 1994 to 1997, a record for the competition. There was a shared title with Bedfordshire in 2004, another success in 2006 and the most recent achievement was a victory against Cambridgeshire in the Championship final at March in September 2011.\nDevon has won the MCCA Knockout Trophy four times since its inception in 1983 – in 1992, 1994, 1998 and 2008.\nThe county first played List A cricket in the 1969 Gillette Cup against Hertfordshire and appeared in 33 List A matches from 1969 to 2005, winning seven and losing 26, the majority of which were against first-class opponents. The county claimed the first-class scalp once, defeating Leicestershire in the 2004 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy. The right to play List A cricket was lost in 2006 when the Minor Counties were excluded from the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy from that onward.\nOrigin of club.\nThe present Devon County Cricket Club was founded on 26 November 1899 and joined the Minor Counties Championship for the 1901 season.\nClub history.\nDevon applied for first-class status and to join the County Championship in 1948. However, they were turned down. \"Wisden Cricketer's Almanack\" on page 952 of its 1950 edition, recorded that the application was discussed at the Advisory County Cricket Committee of existing first-class counties on 15 March 1949. It said: \"No decision was made, but at the meeting, the counties could not find anything to support the application.\"\nDevon has won the Minor Counties Championship seven times, one of them shared. It first won in 1978, when Barrie Matthews was skipper, and for four consecutive years from 1994 to 1997, a record for the competition, under the leadership of the late Peter Roebuck. There was a shared title with Bedfordshire in 2004 and another title in 2006. Their most recent success came in 2011 when they defeated Cambridgeshire in the championship final. Devon has won the MCCA Knockout Trophy five times since its inception in 1983. It won in 1992, 1994, 1998, 2008 and 2014.\nThe county first played List A cricket in the 1969 Gillette Cup against Hertfordshire. The county appeared in 33 List A matches from 1969 to 2005, winning seven and losing 26, the majority of which were against first-class opponents. The county claimed a first-class scalp once, defeating Leicestershire in the 2004 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy. Devon lost the right to play List A cricket when the Minor counties were excluded from the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy from the 2006 season onward.\nIn 2011, the Club set up a Development XI, the Devon Lions, to help bring on new players. It has links to the recently a formed charity, the David Shepherd Cricket Foundation, one of whose objectives is to nurture young cricketing talent in Devon. The Lions play some competitive games against university and county 2nd XI teams.\nGrounds.\nThe club has no fixed home, but play their matches at various grounds across the county. Grounds used during the 2011 season include:"

        "title": "Dan Reeves (American football executive)",
        "text": "Daniel Farrell Reeves (June 30, 1912 – April 15, 1971) was an American sports entrepreneur, best known as the owner of the National Football League (NFL) franchise Los Angeles Rams. He owned the franchise when it was operating in Cleveland, Ohio in 1941, and he would own the team until his death in 1971.\nReeves is remembered for his move of the Rams from Cleveland to Los Angeles in 1946, where it became the first American major league sports franchise on the Pacific Coast. He was also the first NFL owner to sign a black player in the post World War II era, inking deals with halfback Kenny Washington and end Woody Strode in 1946, as well as being the first to employ a full-time scouting staff.\nReeves was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967.\nEarly years.\nHe was born in New York City to Irish immigrants James Reeves and Rose Farrell, who, along with an uncle, Daniel, had risen together from fruit peddlers to owners of a grocery-store chain, bringing wealth to the family.\nReeves was a graduate of the Newman School in Lakewood, New Jersey, and attended Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., which he left before acquiring his degree. While attending Georgetown, Reeves met his future wife, Mary V. Corroon. The couple were married on October 25, 1935, and would together have six children.\nThe Reeves family's grocery chain was sold to Safeway Stores in 1941, generating capital and freeing the youthful Dan Reeves, age 29, to pursue his dream of owning a professional football franchise.\nPurchase of Cleveland Rams.\nTogether with his friend and business partner Robert Levy, Reeves purchased the Cleveland Rams franchise in 1941 from a local ownership group for $135,000. The team was a comparatively young one, launched in 1936, and finances were tight, with as few as 200 season ticket holders and no television revenue, forcing some players to work for as little as $100 per game. The team did not operate in , and Reeves became the sole owner in December, while serving stateside in the U.S. Army Air Forces.\nDespite its financial woes, the previously unsuccessful franchise began to turn around in 1944; the Rams won the Western division title in 1945 and the championship game behind rookie quarterback and league MVP Bob Waterfield, a future member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nMove to Los Angeles.\nImmediately following the conclusion of the season, with the championship game having been played in icy Cleveland before 32,000 fans on December 15, Reeves announced his intention to move his team to sunny Southern California: the League approved the move on January 12, 1946.\nOn January 15, Rams team representatives went before the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission with a plan to lease use of the facility for home games, as it was already the home venue for college football for both UCLA and USC of the Pacific Coast Conference. On January 23, the Coliseum Commission approved use of the 103,000-seat stadium for Rams' Sunday home games during the 1946 season. The move did not immediately cure the team's financial woes, however: in 1947, Reeves found himself in need of co-owners to share the mounting losses while attempting a turnaround. Reeves brought Levy back in for a one-third stake in the team, while another third went to Edwin Pauley and Hal Saley.\nEventually, the team proved to be extremely successful on the field, with quarterback Bob Waterfield helping the team to three straight League Championship games from 1949 to 1951, culminating in the 1951 Championship trophy. Boasting some of football's most glamorous stars, the Rams drew extremely well at the ticket office. Topped by a crowd of 102,368 for game against the San Francisco 49ers in 1957, attendance for Rams games in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum topped 80,000 on 22 occasions during the teams' first two decades in California.\nThe previous closeness between Reeves and Levy fell away, though, and soon Levy was siding with Pauley against Reeves on most significant ownership decisions. Pauley eventually assumed Levy's stake, giving Pauley two-thirds ownership of the team but that did nothing to resolve the constant battles between Pauley and Reeves. Finally in 1962, the NFL stepped in to resolve the situation by holding a closed auction to result in one partner buying out the other. Reeves outbid Pauley for the team, valuing the Rams at $7.1 million against Pauley's bid of $6.1 million. Reeves once again assumed sole ownership.\nHe then raised the funds to support his bid by immediately selling 49% of the team to a group of minority owners that included Gene Autry. By the time of Reeves' death in 1971, the team's value was estimated at $20 million.\nReeves also owned one of Los Angeles' first ice hockey teams, the Western Hockey League's Los Angeles Blades, which lasted from 1961 to 1967 and played nearby the Coliseum at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. Given the Blades' success, Reeves was an early favorite to get a National Hockey League franchise during the 1967 NHL expansion, but the league awarded the team to Los Angeles Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke.\nInnovations.\nThe innovative Reeves made several other significant contributions to pro football. He instituted the famed \"Free Football for Kids\" program that enabled youngsters to enjoy the game in their formative years and then, hopefully, become ardent fans as adults. His signing of the ex-UCLA great, Kenny Washington, in the spring of 1946 marked the first time a black player had been hired in the NFL since 1933.\nReeves' experimentation in the early days of television provided the groundwork for pro football's current successful TV policies. He was also the first to employ a full-time scouting staff.\nRelationship with George Allen.\nIn 1965, Reeves lured away defensive coordinator and head of player personnel George Allen from the Chicago Bears. Allen made key trades and draft choices, which returned the team back to prominence within the next three seasons of his tenure. Allen allegedly had agreed on the deal with Reeves with two years remaining on his contract with the Bears, and a protracted legal battle followed.\nBy 1968, Reeves had sought to go in a new direction as far as to find a new head coach for the team. On Christmas Day, Reeves attempted to fire Allen, but due to the wide public outcry of the Rams' fans over the dismissal, he finally relented and retained Allen as the head coach for the next two years, then fired him again after the 1970 season.\nPro Football HOF enshrinement and death.\nReeves was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967. For his contribution to sports in Los Angeles, he was honored with a Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum \"Court of Honor\" plaque by the Coliseum commissioners. A longtime smoker, Reeves's health began to deteriorate by 1969. Reeves, who was also diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease, succumbed to cancer in his New York City apartment on April 15, 1971.\nAfter Reeves' death, Baltimore Colts owner Carroll Rosenbloom assumed control of the Rams in July 1972, spinning off the Colts to Robert Irsay in a swap of franchises between the owners and their investors."

It was the first victory for the United States in the event since 1924, and the first medal in the event for united Germany (rather than West Germany) since 1912. The United States' Mary Joe Fernández and Spain's Arantxa Sánchez Vicario won the bronze medals. It was Spain's first medal in the women's singles.\nThe tournament was held from 28 July to 7 August at the Tennis de la Vall d'Hebron in Barcelona, Spain. There were 64 competitors from 30 nations, with each nation having up to 3 players.\nBackground.\nThis was the seventh appearance of the women's singles tennis. A women's event was held only once during the first three Games (only men's tennis was played in 1896 and 1904), but has been held at every Olympics for which there was a tennis tournament since 1908. Tennis was not a medal sport from 1928 to 1984, though there were demonstration events in 1968 and 1984.\nGermany's Steffi Graf was the defending Olympic champion (who had achieved the Golden version of the Grand Slam in 1988) and the #1 seed again in 1992. Two of her top competitors, Martina Navratilova of the United States and Monica Seles of Yugoslavia, were ineligible because they had not played in the Billie Jean King Cup. The #2 seed was home crowd favorite Arantxa Sánchez Vicario. The United States had the #3 seed and #4 seed in young phenom Jennifer Capriati and Mary Joe Fernández.\nChile, the People's Republic of China, Latvia, Madagascar, Poland, Romania, South Africa, and Switzerland each made their debut in the event; some former Soviet republics competed as the Unified Team. France and Great Britain each made their sixth appearance, tied for most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament. Unlike previous Olympic tournaments, no bronze medal match was held. All matches were best-of-three sets. The 12-point tie-breaker was used in any set, except the third, that reached 6–6."

        "title": "Rugby Town F.C.",
        "text": "Rugby Town Football Club is a football club based in Rugby, Warwickshire, which plays in the . It is nicknamed \"The Valley\", and plays its home matches at Butlin Road. It was originally named New Bilton Juniors and renamed four times. First, in 1956, to Valley Sports. The next time was in 1971 to Valley Sports Rugby, or simply VS Rugby, then in 2000 to Rugby United, and again for the most recent time to Rugby Town F.C. in 2005.\nHistory.\nFormed by Keith Coughlan and under the name of New Bilton Juniors, the Valley played its first friendly match in 1956.\nIn 1956, the club was renamed for the first time, to Valley Sports and entered the Rugby and District Football League. The club progressed to the Coventry and North Warwickshire Football League in 1963, and to the United Counties League in 1969 changing the name to VS Rugby.\nThe club initially played at Thornfield and then briefly at Hillmorton Recreation ground when Thornfield was taken over for the sports centre before groundsharing with the then Southern Football League side Rugby Town at Oakfield. VS Rugby moved into their own ground, Butlin Road, in 1973 the first competitive game there being a 0–0 draw against Burton Park Wanderers in the United Counties League. In 1975 the club was invited to join the West Midlands League, and took part in the FA Cup for the first time in 1976, being knocked out in the first qualifying round.\nIn 1981, the Valley's most successful manager, Jimmy Knox, took over. He had previously successfully managed the then Rugby Town (for whom he had also made 452 appearances) and AP Leamington. Knox turned around the club's fortunes dramatically and in 1983 they won The FA Vase, defeating Halesowen Town 1–0.\nFor the 1983/84 season the club joined the Southern League where success continued with the club winning The Midland Division in 1986/87, The Southern League Cup in 1989/90 and The Birmingham Senior Cup in 1988/89 and 1991/92.\nDuring Jimmy Knox's 11 years at Butlin Road the Valley had much success in the FA Cup, their best being a run to the second round in 1987/88 being knocked out by Bristol Rovers after a drawn game at Butlin Road. They also had memorable cup ties against Northampton Town, Bristol City, and Leyton Orient.\nIn August 1991, VS Rugby played and beat a strong Manchester United side 1–0 at Butlin Road in a testimonial match to recognise Knox's ten years at the club. United manager Alex Ferguson honoured a verbal agreement made through Knox's brother Archie, who was United's Assistant Manager.\nOnce Knox left the club in 1992 its fortunes started to decline and despite reaching the second round of The FA Cup again in the 1992/93 season they were relegated and the then chairman put the club into receivership. A group of supporters that included founder Keith Coughlan, however, rescued the club, and manager Ron Bradbury stayed on to gain promotion behind newly formed Rushden &amp; Diamonds in 1994. The same season the club also again reached the first round of The FA Cup losing at home to Brentford.\nVS Rugby changed its name to Rugby United in 2000, and to Rugby Town in 2005. In both cases there was a degree of controversy amongst the supporter base. \nValley came close to promotion twice under manager Dave Stringer in the 2012–13 and 2013–14 seasons. In 2012–13 they missed out on the title on the final day before losing to Biggleswade Town in the play-off final at Butlin Road. The following season saw Valley once again in contention for the title on the final day only to fail to secure top spot. Promotion hopes once again ended in the play-offs after a defeat to Slough Town over two legs in the semi-final. The 2014/15 season was less successful for Valley with the club failing to make the play-offs after an inconsistent season. At the end of the campaign, Rugby Town parted company with manager Dave Stringer.\nFor the first time in the club's history, Rugby Town were moved into the Northern Premier League system for the 2015–16 season. Stringer's replacement, former Rushden &amp; Diamonds midfielder Gary Mills, tendered his resignation early into the season after a poor start and was replaced by ex-Tamworth boss Dale Belford. Rugby recovered and finished the season in ninth place before Belford left the club by mutual consent.\nAt the start of the 2016/17 season James Jepson was appointed manager but lasted but a few weeks being replaced by former player Gary Moran in September 2016. Moran could not guide Rugby away from the relegation zone and they were condemned to relegation to the Midland Football League on the final day of the season with Moran resigning shortly afterwards.\nFormer manager Dave Stringer returned to the role of manager in May 2017 after leaving Chasetown.\nRugby Town parted company with manager Dave Stringer in May 2018 and he was subsequently replaced in the same month by Stratford Town F.C. manager Carl Adams.\nIn the 2021-22 season, Rugby Town achieved their most impressive FA Vase run since they won the competition in 1983. They went out in the last sixteen stage at North Shields FC, one of the longest away visits in the club's history.\nDuring 2022-23, Rugby Town led the UCL Premier Division South for much of the season. A poor run of form towards the end of it cost them the league title, but as it eventuated they still attained promotion via being one of the best second-placed teams in the step. They are set to play in the Northern Premier League Midland Division in the 2023-24 season. \nGround.\nThe ground, unlike many in non-league circles, has covering on all four sides of the ground and seating on two sides.\nThe official capacity was confirmed as 5,375 in 2005 but this is set to increase with the new 1,300 covered terrace at the allotment end as well as further terracing developments throughout the stadium.\nNow, approximately 2,800 spectators are able to be accommodated under cover and 740 of these can also be seated. The main stand, which holds 500 fans and also includes the dressing rooms. Helped by a Football Foundation &amp; Stadia Improvement Fund Grant, the stand was open for use in early 2003, but it was not officially opened until August 2003, when ex-England International Darius Vassell did the honours as Rugby played an Aston Villa XI.\nThe 2003–04 season saw the introduction of new dugouts at Butlin Road.

        "text": "The 1974 Tour de France was the 61st edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It took place between 27 June and 21 July, with 22 stages covering a distance of . Eddy Merckx was attempting to win his fifth Tour de France in as many races.\nIn 1974 the tour made its first visit to the United Kingdom, with a circuit stage on the Plympton By-pass, near Plymouth, England.\nThe race was won by favourite Eddy Merckx, who thus at that point had won all five Tours that he had entered, and had equalled Jacques Anquetil in Tour victories. While he won the race by a comfortable margin, he was not as overwhelmingly dominant as he had been in his previous victories with eight riders finishing within 20:00, two riders within 10:00 and his two top competitors in Luis Ocaña and Joop Zoetemelk absent from the race. Despite other riders finishing closer in the overall standings, Merckx still won an astonishing eight stages. He also won the combination classification. Fellow Belgian Patrick Sercu won the points classification, while Spanish Domingo Perurena won the mountains classification.\nTeams.\nThe 1974 Tour de France had 13 teams, with 10 cyclists each.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nEddy Merckx, who had been absent in 1973 after winning four Tours in a row, was present again. Merckx had not been as dominant in the spring as in other years; it was his first year as a professional cyclist in which he did not win a spring classic. He did win the 1974 Giro d'Italia and the Tour de Suisse, but after winning the latter he required surgery on the perineum, five days before the 1974 Tour started.\nNotable absents were Ocaña and Zoetemelk. Zoetemelk was injured during the Midi Libre and was in hospital with life-threatening meningitis. Between 1970 and 1986 this would be the only Tour Zoetemelk would not start and finish, and would be the only Tour until 1983 that he was not in the top ten.\nOcaña had crashed in the Tour de l'Aude, gone home and was fired by his team for not communicating.\nBernard Thévenet, who was considered a potential winner, had crashed several times in the 1974 Vuelta a España. He did start in the Tour, but was not yet back at his former level.\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1974 Tour de France started on 27 June, and had two rest days, in Aix-les-Bains and Colomiers. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit tunnel of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 11.\nRace overview.\nMerckx won the prologue, with his teammate Joseph Bruyère in third place. In the first stage, Bruyère was part of a breakaway, and became the new leader.\nThe second stage was in Plymouth, the first time that the Tour de France visited England. The riders did not like the experiment, as the British immigration officials made the cyclists wait for a long time when entering the country and again when returning to France.\nMerckx collected bonus time in the sprints, and in the fourth stage took back the leading position in the general classification, with Gerben Karstens in second place. Karstens was also doing well in the points classification, and felt Merckx and Patrick Sercu, the leaders in the general and points classification, were helping each other. Karstens was angry and after the finish quickly went away, but forgot that he had to go to the doping control. For this, he was given ten minutes penalty time, and thus he lost his second place in the general classification. Karstens complained to the jury, and other cyclists threatened with a strike, so the jury removed the penalty after the fifth stage. Thanks to bonification seconds in that stage, Karstens took the leading position after that stage.\nIt was still close in the top of the general classification. Patrick Sercu became the new leader after the first part of the sixth stage, but Karstens regained the lead after the second part of the sixth stage, a team time trial won by Merckx's team, Molteni. Merckx won the seventh stage, and became the next leader.\nThe Alps were the first serious mountains to be seen, in stage nine. Merckx won the stage, but the surprise of the day was Raymond Poulidor, who at 38 years old was still able to escape during the toughest part of the stage. This also happened in the tenth stage: Poulidor joined the crucial escape, but could not beat Merckx in the final sprint.\nIn the tenth stage, the hardest Alpine stage, Vicente López Carril from the KAS team stayed away. Merckx was in the next group, together with Francisco Galdós and Gonzalo Aja, also from the KAS team. Aja was in third place in the general classification, so Merckx was unable to chase Lopez Carril without helping his rival Aja.\nThe next stages did not change the general classification. In the fifteenth stage, the Pyrenées were encountered. There was a crash that took down Galdós, now in sixth place in the general classification, and he had to leave the race.\nThe Tour was in Spain at that point, and Basque separatist placed bombs on press and team cars. There was violence around France, Andorra and in Corsica from unrelated protests including from farmers and other angry nationalists and in some areas people hung dead pigs from street lamps. The bombings in the Pyrenees took place in the middle of the night in Lourdes where thirteen vacant buses and two parked cars where destroyed. Then a few hours later at Saint-Lary-Soulan several vehicles associated with the Tour de France were targeted and blown up. No one was in them at the time. Leaflets were distributed threatening the fascist government of Spain and telling Spanish riders to leave the race. Other acts of violence against the Tour included many trees being cut down to block the route, which had to be dealt with and removed.\nNobody was hurt, but cyclists were scared: Spanish champion Lopez Carril did not wear his national champion's jersey, afraid to become a target because of the Spanish flag on it.\nIn the sixteenth stage, with an uphill finish, Poulidor won, his first Tour stage victory since 1965. Merckx finished in fourth place, losing time to Poulidor, Lopez Carril and Pollentier.\nIn the seventeenth stage, Poulidor again won time, finishing second after Jean-Pierre Danguillaume, and jumped to the third place in the general classification, behind Merckx and Lopez Carril.\nDanguillaume also won the eighteenth stage, the last mountain stage. The favourites stayed together with Merckx, and at that point Merckx was more or less certain of the victory, with two time trials remaining, in which he normally would gain time on the others.\nPoulidor battled with Lopez-Carril for the second place. After the time trial in the second part of stage 21, Poulidor captured the second place by just one second. Surprisingly, Merckx was in second place in that time trial, beaten by Michel Pollentier. In the last stage, Poulidor increased the margin to Lopez Carril to five seconds due to bonus seconds in an intermediate sprint. At the finish of that last, Sercu finished first in a sprint, but he had blocked the way of Gustaaf Van Roosbroeck, so the jury decided to set him back, and the second rider to finish (Merckx) was declared winner of the stage. Normally, a rider penalized for blocking another rider during a sprint would be set back to the last place of the group that he finished in, but that would have meant that Sercu would have not only lost the stage victory to Merckx, but also the points classification. The jury then declared that only three riders were really sprinting for the stage victory, so Sercu would be set back to the third place; this enabled him to keep his victory in the points classification by 13 points.\nDoping.\nCyrille Guimard, who had won the first part of stage eight, tested positive for piperidine after stage thirteen. Three other cyclists tested positive:Claude Tollet, for amphetamine; Daniel Ducreux, for piperidine; Carlos Melero, for piperidine.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were several classifications in the 1974 Tour de France, three of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, where cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, but was not identified with a jersey in 1974.\nAnother classification was the combination classification. This classification was calculated as a combination of the other classifications, its leader wore the white jersey.\nThe fifth individual classification was the intermediate sprints classification. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but only points were awarded on intermediate sprints. In 1974, this classification had no associated jersey.\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification were identified by yellow caps. There was also a team points classification. Cyclists received points according to their finishing position on each stage, with the first rider receiving one point. The first three finishers of each team had their points combined, and the team with the fewest points led the classification. The riders of the team leading this classification wore green caps.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award, in which a jury composed of journalists gave points after certain stages to the cyclist they considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. At the conclusion of the Tour, Eddy Merckx won the overall super-combativity award, also decided by journalists. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given to the first rider to pass the memorial to Tour founder Henri Desgrange near the summit of the Col du Galibier on stage 11. This prize was won by Vicente López Carril.\nAftermath.\nWith his fifth Tour victory, Merckx equalled Jacques Anquetil. Moreover, Merckx had won the first five Tours that he entered. Merckx set a few new records after winning the 1974 Tour:\nMerckx had already won the 1974 Giro d'Italia earlier that year, and after winning the 1974 Tour de France also won the world championship, and became the first cyclist to win the Triple Crown of Cycling."

The Tour started with 12 teams, each with 11 cyclists.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nThe winner of the previous four editions, Eddy Merckx had changed sponsors to the Italian Molteni. His contract said that he had to start in the 1973 Vuelta a España and the 1973 Giro d'Italia, and Merckx thought it was impossible to start in three grand tours in one year, so he stayed away from the Tour. Ocaña, who was in great shape, was now the main favourite, with Fuente, Poulidor and Thévenet as his biggest threats. Ocaña was not the clear favourite; he had already crashed out of the Tour three times, and he was seen as fragile. Zoetemelk had changed teams, because he did not have the full support of his team leader. Among the Italian riders absent were world champion Marino Basso and former Tour winner Felice Gimondi.\nRoute and stages.\nAfter the 1972 Tour de France, there were rumours that the 1973 Tour would become easier, to suit French cyclist Cyrille Guimard better. However, when the 1973 Tour route was announced in December 1972, the organisation had included three more mountains compared to 1972. The race started on 30 June, and had two rest days, in Divonne-les-Bains and . The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit tunnel of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 8.\nRace overview.\nZoetemelk won the opening prologue, one second ahead of Poulidor. In the first part of the next stage, Teirlinck won and took over the lead. Ocaña and Herman Van Springel fell down when a dog crossed the road, but both suffered no serious damage. In the second part of that stage, Van Springel bridged the gap to Catieau, who had escaped. Van Springel did all the work to stay away, while Catieau did not help his team captain's rival. They stayed away until the end of the stage, where Catieau won the sprint, and Van Springel became the new race leader.\nIn the third stage, a group with Guimard and Ocana escaped. Van Springel, Zoetemelk, Fuentes, Thévenet and Poulidor were not in that group, and had to chase them. The group stayed away, Guimard won the sprint and Catieau became the race leader. More important for the final result was that Ocaña won more than two minutes on Zoetemelk, and more than seven minutes on Fuente.\nIn stage seven, when the first mountains were climbed, Ocaña attacked, and only Zoetemelk could follow. A few kilometers from the summit, Zoetemelk had to let Ocaña go, and Ocaña finished solo. Ocaña became the new race leader, almost three minutes ahead of Zoetemelk. In the eighth stage, Ocaña and Fuente both attacked. Ocaña and Fuente did not like each other, and when Fuente stopped working, Ocaña was angry, especially when Fuente passed him just before the top of the Izoard to steal the points for the mountain classification. When Fuente had a flat tire, Ocaña did not wait for him, and left him behind, beating him by one minute at the finish line. All the others were far behind: Thévenet and Martinez followed after seven minutes, the other pre-race favourites after twenty minutes.\nIn the thirteenth stage, Poulidor crashed, and was taken away with a helicopter. In the sixteenth stage, the cyclists were slower than expected, and finished one hour after the latest time schedule. The train that they should have taken had already left, and they had to use buses.\nIn the time trial in stage 17, Fuente lost his second place in the general classification to Thévenet. Fuente tried to take it back in the mountain stage 18, but he failed and even lost some time.\nDoping.\nThree cyclists tested positive during the 1973 Tour de France: Barry Hoban, after the 9th stage; Claude Baud, after the 13th stage; and Michel Roques, after the 18th stage. All three received a fine of 1000 Swiss Francs, one-month suspension and ten minutes penalty time in the general classification.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were several classifications in the 1973 Tour de France, three of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, where cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, but was not identified with a jersey in 1973.\nAnother classification was the combination classification. This classification was calculated as a combination of the other classifications, its leader wore the white jersey.\nThe fifth individual classification was the intermediate sprints classification. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but only points were awarded on intermediate sprints. In 1973, this classification had no associated jersey.\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification were identified by yellow caps. For the first time, there was also a team points classification. Cyclists received points according to their finishing position on each stage, with the first rider receiving one point. The first three finishers of each team had their points combined, and the team with the fewest points led the classification. The riders of the team leading this classification wore green caps.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award, in which a jury composed of journalists gave points after certain stages to the cyclist they considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. At the conclusion of the Tour, Luis Ocaña won the overall super-combativity award, also decided by journalists. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given to the first rider to pass the memorial to Tour founder Henri Desgrange near the summit of the Col du Galibier on stage 8. This prize was won by Ocaña."

        "text": "The 1972 Tour de France was the 59th edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It took place from 1 to 22 July, with 20 stages covering a distance of . After riding strongly in the first two weeks of the race and being the closest GC contender to Eddy Merckx, Luis Ocaña crashed, in the Pyrenees, leaving Merckx to battle Cyrille Guimard for the win. Guimard, having won four stages, had to leave the race after stage 17 in second place (he already was 7:58 behind at that point), but was given the combativity award after the race.\nTeams.\nThe 1972 Tour started with 12 teams, each with 11 cyclists, a total of 132.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nIn the previous year, Luis Ocaña was on his way to beat Eddy Merckx, when he fell as leader and had to give up. Everybody expected Merckx and Ocana to battle for the victory in 1972. Ocana felt that he could have won the 1971 Tour, and Merckx did not like the comments that he did not deserve the 1971 victory, and both wanted to show their strengths. Merckx had won important races before the Tour started, including the 1972 Giro d'Italia, and was also the reigning world champion. Ocana had won less races, but won the Criterium du Dauphiné Libéré. The most important other participants were considered Raymond Poulidor, Felice Gimondi, Joop Zoetemelk and Bernard Thévenet.\nJosé Manuel Fuente, who had won the 1972 Vuelta a España and finished second in the 1972 Giro d'Italia, did not compete, as his team decided they had already been in too many hard races. Herman Van Springel had announced four days prior to the Tour that he would leave his team after his contract would end at the end of 1972. His team then removed him from the Tour squad.\nRoute and stages.\nFor the first time since 1947, the Tour de France was entirely in France. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit tunnel of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 14a.\nThree days before the Tour started on 1 July, the schedule was changed: the final time trial was split, with the first 42 km as a time trial in the morning, and the last 89 km as a mass-start stage in the afternoon. There were two rest days, in Bayonne and Orcières.\nRace overview.\nMerckx won the prologue, beating his rivals by some seconds. In the first stage, Cyrille Guimard won the sprint, and because of the bonification seconds took over the leader's jersey in the general classification. In the next stages, Merckx tried to win back time by winning bonification seconds in intermediate sprints and at the finish, but Guimard used the same tactic. Merckx won back the first position thanks to the bonification seconds after the team time trial in stage 3b, but lost it again in the fourth stage.\nMerckx won the time trial in the second part of the fifth stage, but Guimard came third, retaining the lead. After the sixth stage, Guimard was 11 seconds ahead of Merckx. The third place was occupied by a teammate of Merckx, and Ocaña was in fourth place, one minute behind Guimard.\nIn the seventh stage, the Tour reached the Pyrenees. Ocaña attacked two times, and the second time only Merckx could follow. When Ocaña punctured, and later crashed with Thevenet, Merckx was away without him. Another group, including Zoetemelk and Guimard, had reached Merckx, and crossed the finish line together. Ocana finished in sixth place, losing 1 minute and 49 seconds. Thevenet lost more than six minutes that stage, and lost all hope of winning. He was taken to the hospital to see if the crash had caused serious injuries, but could start the next stage. In the eighth stage, Lucien Van Impe attacked on the last climb. Merckx caught him and won the stage, with Ocana only eight seconds behind him. Guimard lost three minutes, and Merckx overtook him in the general classification. In the ninth stage, Roger Pingeon left the race. He did not play an important role in the general classification, but his team expected him to help his teammate Thevenet in the rest of the race.\nThe eleventh stage ended with the climb up to Mont Ventoux. After Merckx' team had pushed the pace such that most cyclists in the peloton had dropped, Ocana attacked four times. Every time, Merckx was able to chase him, together with only Poulidor. Poulidor then attacked, but could not get away. Some other cyclists were able to get back, including Thevenet. Thevenet then attacked, and left the others behind, winning the stage.\nMerckx expected Ocana to attack in the twelfth stage, so he stayed with him. When Joaquim Agostinho and Lucien Van Impe attacked, Merckx let them go and stayed with Ocana, as Merckx only cared about Ocana; he did not want Ocana to win back time, and did not want him to win the stage which could give him inspiration in the next stages. On the thirteenth stage, Merckx' team first set a pace that eliminated all but 16 cyclists at the start of the climb of the Vars. Raymond Delisle escaped from that group, but Merckx and Agostinho chased and passed him after the summit. On the way down, Guimard was able to catch Merckx, who had dropped Delisle and Agostinho. Climbing the Izoard, Merckx dropped Guimard, and soloed to the victory. By then, Merckx was leading the general classification firmly, almost five minutes ahead of Ocana.\nThe first part of the fourteenth stage was also won by Merckx, who outsprinted Zoetemelk. Ocana lost two minutes, and Guimard overtook him in the general classification.\nIn the second part of the fourteenth stage, Ocana lost more than five minutes. Guimard and Merckx sprinted for the stage victory, and the photo finish gave the victory to Guimard. Ocana left the race after that stage; he had contracted a lung infection after his fall in the seventh stage. The stage ended with two laps of 1800 m; when it was found out that one group had missed one lap, the rules said that this group would have to ride that lap again, but the jury decided to use the times clocked after the first lap.\nThe fifteenth stage was also narrowly won by Guimard; Merckx had already raised one hand to cheer. In the seventeenth stage, Guimard struggled with his health. He needed medical attention during the entire stage, and lost two minutes on the final climb. After 10 km in the eighteenth stage, he left the race.\nMerckx was now leading by more than ten minutes, and was certain to win the race. The second place was still not certain; Poulidor and Gimondi were separated only by one second. In the time trial on the last day, won by Merckx, the decision fell: Gimondi came in second, Poulidor fourth, and Gimondi overtook Poulidor in the general classification. After the finish in Paris, Merckx gave the green jersey that he received for winning the points classification to Guimard, who otherwise would have been the winner of that classification.\nDoping.\nGuimard had been treated by Bernard Sainz. After Guimard left the race, there were rumours that Guimard had been using doping in the last days of the Tour; to end these rumours, he requested that after the eighteenth stage, he would also be checked for doping.\nIn 2000, Sainz wrote the book \"The stunning revelation of Dr. Mabuse\", where he denied that he was responsible.\nLater that year, Eddy Merckx finished second in the athlete of the year poll, behind Mark Spitz.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were several classifications in the 1972 Tour de France, three of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, where cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, but was not identified with a jersey in 1972.\nAnother classification was the combination classification. This classification was calculated as a combination of the other classifications, its leader wore the white jersey.\nThe fifth individual classification was the intermediate sprints classification. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but only points were awarded on intermediate sprints. In 1972, this classification had no associated jersey.\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification wore yellow caps.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award, in which a jury composed of journalists gave points after mass-start stages to the cyclist they considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. At the conclusion of the Tour, Cyrille Guimard won the overall super-combativity award, also decided by journalists. Three further daily individual awards were given for good humour, teamwork and elegance. Overall awards were given for these also, with Bernard Thévenet seen as the funniest, Martin Van Den Bossche the best teammate and Felice Gimondi the most elegant. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given to the first rider to pass the memorial to Tour founder Henri Desgrange near the summit of the Col du Galibier on stage 14a. This prize was won by Joop Zoetemelk."

        "text": "Steven Bruce Riley (November 23, 1952 – September 16, 2021) was an American professional football player who was an offensive tackle for 11 seasons with the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League (NFL).\nHigh school career.\nRiley went to Castle Park High School in Chula Vista, California where he was a standout athlete on both the high school varsity basketball and football teams. Castle Park fielded very strong football teams. In his senior year, he was one of the co-captains and helped his team win the San Diego CIF championship. He also made first-team all-CIF and was voted offensive lineman of the year in his conference.\nCollege career.\nRiley was recruited by Notre Dame, Colorado, New Mexico State, and San Diego State, among others. He played college football at the University of Southern California from 1970 to 1974. Riley moved from guard to tackle following his freshman season. As a junior he started at tackle and was a part of the historic undefeated 1972 USC Trojans team.\nHe played in two Rose Bowls, one of those being the 1973 Rose Bowl, where the USC Trojans defeated the Ohio State Buckeyes, 42-17, to become the national champions. The 1972 USC Trojans team is regarded by some as the best college football team ever.\nProfessional career.\nRiley was picked 25th overall in the first round of the 1974 NFL draft by the Minnesota Vikings. He played 11 seasons, all with the Vikings, from 1974 to 1984. He appeared in 138 games, making 128 starts. He was a part of the 1974 and 1976 NFC championship teams. He played in Super Bowls IX and XI.\nRiley took over the starting left tackle position in 1976 and started every game until early 1978 when a neck injury put him on the injured reserve game for 11 games. Riley returned to full-time duty in 1979 and started every game for the next five seasons. Over his career, Riley helped the Vikings reach the playoffs seven times. He started in Super Bowl XI to cap that season and helped Minnesota advance to the 1977 NFC Championship game.\nIn his last year, Riley started every game despite playing the entire season with his left hand in a cast because of a broken thumb. He started the first six games at left tackle however, in attempt to decrease the amount of contact to his injured hand, he was moved to right tackle for games 7 through 11. Riley went back to left tackle for the remainder of the season as his teammate said the blind side position was too challenging.\nAwards and honors.\nWhile at USC, he earned All-American first team honors as a 1973 senior as the Trojans returned to the Rose Bowl. He then played in the 1974 College All-Star game.\nRiley was voted by his teammates to be the recipient of the Ed Block Courage Award in 1984 largely in part of playing his entire last year with a broken thumb. His games played rank fourth-most in Vikings history among tackles.\nPersonal life.\nRiley resided in Southern California after his retirement where he owned a successful commercial property maintenance business in Irvine.\nHe appeared as an extra in five movies, including \"The Bear Bryant Story\", \"North Dallas Forty\", and \"Against All Odds\".\nHe was married to his wife, Jan, for 40 years. He had four daughters, Bryn, Erin, Lauren and Kristen, and thirteen grandchildren."

        "text": "Brett Barry Clark (born December 23, 1976) is a Canadian-American former professional ice hockey defenceman. He previously played in the National Hockey League with the Montreal Canadiens, Atlanta Thrashers, Colorado Avalanche, Tampa Bay Lightning and the Minnesota Wild.\nPlaying career.\nClark was drafted in the 6th round, 154th overall, by the Montreal Canadiens in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft. He was selected from the University of Maine of the Hockey East where he named to the All-Rookie Team in his freshman year. Under the preference of the Canadiens, Clark spent the following season developing with the Canadian National Team program, before he made his professional debut in the 1997–98 season.\nAfter only 20 games with AHL affiliate, the Fredericton Canadiens, Clark made his debut with the Canadiens and remained with the team scoring a goal, on his 21st birthday, in 41 games for the season. Not used as a depth defenseman in the playoffs, he further established himself in the 1998–99 season, appearing in 61 contests for the Canadiens.\nOn June 25, 1999, Clark was claimed in the 1999 expansion draft by the Atlanta Thrashers. His NHL career stalled with the Thrashers, unable to find a role in his three seasons. He found success on the Thrashers' minor-league affiliate team, winning the Turner Cup in 2001 with the Orlando Solar Bears.\nDuring the 2001–02 season on January 24, 2002, Clark was traded by the Thrashers to the Colorado Avalanche for Frederic Cassivi. He spent the majority of the next three seasons with the Avalanche's affiliate, the Hershey Bears of the AHL. He was twice named the Bears' best defenseman of the year, and led the AHL in plus/minus (+28) in 2000–01.\nAfter the 2004 NHL Lockout, and at age 28, Clark finally established a role as a two-way defenseman with the Avalanche in 2005–06. He appeared in 80 games and scored a respectable 36 points. In his playoff debut, he scored against the Dallas Stars in game one of the Western Conference Quarterfinals on April 22, and subsequently finished the playoffs tied with Rob Blake for the team scoring lead among defenseman with four points.

On February 24, 2007, Clark played in his 300th career NHL game against the Los Angeles Kings.\nOn August 27, 2007, Clark signed a two-year contract extension with the Avalanche prior to the 2007–08 season. He again led the NHL in shifts per game before he was sidelined for the rest of the regular season and playoffs after suffering a dislocated shoulder on February 12, 2008. In 2008–09 Clark returned to set an Avalanche record of 238 hits, second in the NHL, but struggled offensively in recording 12 points in 76 games. In the 2009–10 season, on January 29, Clark appeared in his 500th career NHL game against the Dallas Stars.\nAfter eight seasons within the Avalanche organization Clark left as a free agent to sign a two-year contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning on July 5, 2010. In the 2010–11 season, Clark was re-inserted on the powerplay with the Lightning and produced 9 goals for his highest total since 2007, helping the Lightning advance to the 2011 Eastern Conference finals.\nA free agent upon the 2012 NHL lockout, Clark signed an AHL contract with the Oklahoma City Barons during the midpoint of the 2012–13 season on January 21, 2013. Clark immediately established himself within the Barons producing 17 points in just 18 games. On March 13, 2013, Clark signalled his return to the NHL after he was signed to add a veteran presence for the remainder of the season with the Minnesota Wild. Clark primarily was used as a reserve defensemen however played in 8 games with the Wild, compiling 1 assist.\nA free agent again well into the 2013–14 season, Clark signed a professional try-out with the Lake Erie Monsters on December 6, 2013, marking a return of sorts to NHL affiliate, the Colorado Avalanche.

He also notoriously lived above a Workington fish 'n' chip shop with his wife, commenting \"\"every morning I trudged to training and swore we'd never come back to this country\".\"\nHis most notable on-field contribution was on his début as he helped the club to an 18–18 draw with Halifax Blue Sox, one of only five points that the club secured in 1996 as they finished bottom of Super League. Smith's high bomb led to the side's third try, scored by Wayne Kitchin.\nCoaching career.\nIn 2000 he was appointed the head coach of the Japan national rugby league team for the Emerging Nations tournament. Unfortunately his spell wasn't successful as Japan failed and lost all three games in the Tournament.\nHuddersfield Giants.\nAfter returning home to Australia after finishing his playing career with Workington, Smith turned to coaching and applied for the job of Super League club Huddersfield Giants in September 2001. His first season in charge saw Huddersfield Giants relegated to National League One, which consequently followed their dreadful start to the season losing 13 games in a row, a record number of consecutive defeats for a coach who held on to his job in British Rugby League.\nConversely, Huddersfield Giants returned to Super League the following year after not losing a single game throughout the National League One season. This culminated in their Grand Final win against Leigh Centurions which secured the team's promotion. In their return season to Super League in 2003 Huddersfield Giants avoided relegation, finishing in 10th place which at the time was by far the club's best Super League finish.\nLeeds Rhinos.\nSmith was appointed head coach of the Leeds Rhinos in a surprise move in November 2003 as the club decided to move incumbent Daryl Powell into an upstairs role for two years from the start of the 2004 season.\nHe guided the Leeds Rhinos to their 2004 Super League Grand Final victory against the Bradford Bulls, their first Championship in 32 years, and went on to beat the Canterbury Bulldogs in the 2005 World Club Challenge at Elland Road. In 2005 Leeds made both the Challenge Cup Final and 2005 Super League Grand Final, but were unsuccessful in both matches, losing to Hull F.C. and the Bradford Bulls respectively. Smith was however named Super League coach of the year for 2005 and signed a contract extension to the end of the 2006 season.\nThe Leeds Rhinos failed to win a trophy in the 2006 season, suffering defeat at the Semi-Final stage of the Challenge Cup and losing out to the Warrington Wolves in 2006's Super League XI Play-Offs.\nSmith secured his second Super League championship with victory in the 2007 Super League Grand Final, his final game as coach of Leeds Rhinos.\nGreat Britain.\nSmith was announced as the successor to Brian Noble and became the full-time coach of Great Britain. He saw out his Leeds contract until the end of the 2007 season and combined the GB coaching role with that of performance director and headed up the Rugby Football League's technical department at Leeds Metropolitan University.\nHis first game in charge of Great Britain was a victory over France. The 3-0 whitewash of New Zealand followed with a 20–14 victory at Huddersfield, a 44-0 thrashing of the Kiwis in the 2nd test at Hull and a final test win at the JJB by 28 points to 22. Leeds Rhinos players contributed hugely to these victories including captain Jamie Peacock, half-backs Rob Burrow and Danny McGuire, 2nd Row Gareth Ellis and centre Keith Senior. As this was the last test series as a Great Britain side on home soil. Smith then led the England side into the 2008 World Cup. Only overseas touring sides now use the Great Britain name.\nAt the end of the year, Tony was named the RLIF Coach of the Year for a successful 2007 season.\nEngland.\nSmith became a naturalized British citizen on 8 September 2008 at a ceremony in Huddersfield. He coached England in the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, making the semi-finals.\nWarrington Wolves.\nOn 5 March 2009, Warrington Wolves announced that Smith was to take over as their new head coach while continuing to coach England on a part-time basis. His first game in charge of Warrington was a 14–20 defeat at home to former club Leeds Rhinos.\nOn 29 August 2009, he led Warrington to their first Challenge Cup Final since 1990, and ultimately the team's first final victory since 1974, beating his former club the Huddersfield Giants 25–16.\nSmith coached the Warrington Wolves to their 2010 Challenge Cup Final victory over the Leeds Rhinos at Wembley Stadium, their second consecutive Cup victory. and there are groups on Facebook about smith \nSmith coached the Warrington Wolves to their first League Leaders' Shield in the Super League era in 2011 and the Warrington Wolves became the first team in 6-years to break 1,000 points scored during one season (the last team to do so being Smith's Leeds Rhinos, along with St. Helens and the Bradford Bulls in the same season).\nHe led the Wolves to their 2012 Challenge Cup Final victory over the Leeds Rhinos at Wembley Stadium.\nHe coached the Warrington Wolves to the 2012 Super League Grand Final defeat by the Leeds Rhinos at Old Trafford.\nHe played in the 2013 Super League Grand Final defeat by the Wigan Warriors at Old Trafford.\nHe coached the Warrington Wolves to the 2016 Challenge Cup Final defeat by Hull F.C. at Wembley Stadium.\nAfter leading Warrington Wolves to the Super League Grand Final in 2012, 2013 and 2016 at Old Trafford, and also his second League Leaders' Shield in 2016, his spell as Warrington Wolves coach ended in 2017 when he departed the club at the end of the 2017 Super League season; at the time he was the league's longest-serving coach.\nHull Kingston Rovers.\nSmith was announced as the new head coach of Hull Kingston Rovers on 6 June 2019 following the sacking of former Hull KR coach Tim Sheens the day before. At the end of the 2019 Super League season, Hull KR finished 11th on the table. In Smith's first full season as head coach in 2020, Hull KR finished bottom of the Super League but were spared from relegation due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the expulsion of Toronto. In the 2021 Super League season, Smith guided Hull KR to sixth on the table as they qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 2013. After upsetting Warrington 19–0 in the first week of the playoffs, Hull KR travelled to France for the semi-final against Catalans Dragons. Hull KR would lose the match 28-10 which ended their season one game short of the grand final.\nOn 4 July 2022, Smith was terminated as head coach of Hull Kingston Rovers after the club had only won a single match since St. George's Day of the 2022 season with the side were sitting 10th on the table. Smith had announced in April that he was leaving the club at the end of the campaign which resulted in a massive drop in form. Smith was replaced by interim head coach Danny McGuire.\nHull F.C..\nOn 13 September 2022, Smith was announced as the new head coach of Hull F.C.\nIn the Super League XXVIII season, Smith's first year in charge ended with a 10th placed finish.\nOn 11 April 2024, Smith stepped down as head coach after 18 months in charge. Hull F.C. had started the 2024 Super League season poorly losing six of their first seven matches with their only victory coming in a last gasp effort against the London Broncos. Under Smith, Hull F.C. in 2024 conceded 50 points or more on three occasions."

        "title": "Frank Grant (baseball)",
        "text": "Ulysses Franklin Grant (August 1, 1865 – May 27, 1937) was an American baseball player in the 19th century. Early in his career, he was a star player in the International League, shortly before race-based restrictions were imposed that banned African-American players from organized baseball. Grant then became a pioneer in the early Negro leagues, starring for several of the top African-American teams of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He is widely considered to have been the greatest African-American player of the 19th century. In 2006, Grant was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nBaseball career.\nGrant was born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. He played semipro baseball in Pittsfield and in Plattsburgh, New York.\nIn 1886, Grant played for the Meriden Silvermen team of the Eastern League, based in Meriden, Connecticut. After Meriden folded during the season. Grant signed with the Buffalo Bisons in the International League, one level below the major leagues. Though most sources indicate the official integration of organized baseball would not come for several more decades, Grant was one of five black players who played in baseball's otherwise white minor leagues at the time. When he debuted with the team, a Buffalo newspaper reporter referred to Grant as \"a Spaniard\". His batting average was .344 with Buffalo that season.\nIn an April 1887 preseason game against the Philadelphia Phillies at the Jefferson Street Grounds, Grant homered and was cited for his \"remarkable fielding.\" During the 1887 season, the 22-year-old batted .353, paced the IL with 11 home runs and 49 extra-base hits, and led Buffalo with 40 stolen bases. In 1887, Jack Chapman, the Bisons' veteran manager, valued Grant's services at $5,000—a compliment when Chicago had recently sold superstar King Kelly to Boston for $10,000. During the 1887 season, Grant hit for the cycle in one game and stole home twice in another. Despite significant racial turmoil that year, Buffalo forced the IL to rescind a proposed color line to keep Grant in town.\nBy 1888, anti-black sentiment was all around the league, and it seemed only Buffalo argued against segregation (possibly because of Grant). While with the Bisons, Grant led the team in batting average every year but was disliked by his teammates. He frequently faced hostile opponents who tried to injure him on the field. When blacks were banned from organized, white-controlled baseball in 1889, Grant went on to become a successful Negro leaguer for the Cuban Giants, Cuban X-Giants, Big Gorhams, Brooklyn Royal Giants, and Philadelphia Giants into the 20th century. His career ended in 1903.\nAuthor Jerry Malloy described Grant as \"the greatest Negro baseball player of the 19th century.\" In the late 19th century, few black hitters matched up with Grant. He had substantial power at the plate, often hitting home runs and very often getting extra-base hits. Grant hit for extra bases every four times he got a hit. He achieved this even though he was quite small (5'7\", 155 pounds).\nA middle infielder, mostly a second baseman, Grant had fielding skills widely praised as the best in the league. He was known as \"The Black Dunlap\", a comparison drawn to the defensive skills of 19th-century white second baseman Fred Dunlap. Grant is also notable for becoming the first black player to play on the same team in organized baseball for three consecutive seasons.\nLater life.\nAfter his baseball career, Grant's name rarely appeared in the press. He lived a quiet life as a waiter for a catering company. Grant died at age 71 in New York City. His grave in East Ridgelawn Cemetery, Clifton, New Jersey, was unmarked until June 2011.\nIn 2006, Grant was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. He is the earliest Negro league player to have received that honor."

        "title": "Philadelphia Stars (baseball)",
        "text": "The Philadelphia Stars were a Negro league baseball team from Philadelphia. The Stars were founded in 1933 when Ed Bolden returned to professional black baseball after being idle since early 1930. The Stars were an independent ball club in 1933, a member of the Negro National League from 1934 until the League's collapse following the 1948 season, and affiliated with the Negro American League from 1949 to 1952.\nIn 1934, led by 20-year-old left-hander Slim Jones, the Stars defeated the Chicago American Giants in a controversial playoff series, four games to three, for the Negro National League pennant. At their high point in mid-1930s, the team starred such greats as Biz Mackey, Jud Wilson, and Dick Lundy. Following his release by Cleveland, Satchel Paige signed with the Stars in July 1950, before returning to the Majors with Bill Veeck and the St. Louis Browns.\nThe club disbanded after the 1952 season.\nHistory.\nThe Stars were founded and organized by Ed Bolden. Bolden had owned the Hilldale Club that won the Eastern Colored League pennant in 1923, 1924, and 1925, and which beat the Kansas City Monarchs in the Negro League World Series in 1925. Bolden was also a founder of the ECL. Bolden was instrumental in building the Stars' 1934 championship club and ran the team until his death in 1950.\nAfter Bolden's death, his ownership passed to his daughter, Hilda Bolden Shorter. Shorter ran the club through 1952.\nThe team was financed, and owned in part by sports promoter Eddie Gottlieb who also owned the Philadelphia Sphas and Philadelphia Warriors basketball teams. Gottlieb leased Penmar Park from the Pennsylvania Railroad for use by the Stars. In addition to the Stars, Gottlieb was the booking agent for all the Negro league teams in the Northeast, taking 10-percent of gate receipts for his work.\n1933: Independent.\nEd Bolden organized the Philadelphia Stars who played their first season in 1933. The Negro National League was composed primarily of mid-western teams in 1933 and many east-coast clubs were independent. The Stars were originally one such unaffiliated club and primarily played against local white semi-professional and professional teams. For example, by June 1933, the Stars' only games against black teams had been against the Philadelphia Bacharach Giants and the Pittsburgh Crawfords.\n1934–1948: Negro National League.\nThe Negro National League used a split-season playoff system in 1934 with the season's first-half winner playing the second-half winner for the championship. The Chicago American Giants won the first-half. The Stars won the second-half with a record of 11-4.\nThe Stars won the 1934 Negro National League Championship by beating the Chicago American Giants 4-3-1 in a best of seven game series. The championship series, however, was beset by problems.\nThe first four games of the best-of-seven series were played in Chicago. The games went smoothly and Chicago won three of four. But game 5 was delayed by 10 days for unexplained reasons. When the Series resumed in Philadelphia, the Stars won game 6 to tie the series but did so amidst controversy.\nEarly in game 6, Stars’ third-baseman Jud Wilson seemed to hit umpire Bert Gholston which should have meant immediate ejection. Over the protest of Chicago manager Dave Malarcher, Gholston refused to eject Wilson. Later in the game, Stars catcher Ameal Brooks pushed another of the umpires who also refused to eject the Stars player.\nPrior to game 7, Malarcher filed a protest with NNL Commissioner Rollo Wilson over Jud Wilson's actions. The Commissioner met with the team owners and umpires. Gholston claimed he had wanted to eject Wilson but was threatened by Stars players and intimidated into allowing Wilson to play. Stars owner Bolden threatened not to play game 7 if Jud Wilson was suspended and the Commissioner buckled under the pressure.\nThe teams played game 7 on October 1 at Passon Field. The game ended in a 4-4 tie due to darkness. Game 8 was played the following day and Slim Jones pitched the Stars to a 2-0 victory and the championship.\nBoth the Stars and Giants filed protests over games 7 and 8. Giants player Turkey Stearnes hit an umpire and controversy hung over the series. The Stars claimed the Giants had used ineligible players. The Giants protested that two games should not have been played at night. Nevertheless, the Stars championship was upheld by the league.\nThe Stars finished in fourth place in 1945 and 1946, fifth in 1947, and finished in fourth place again in 1948 with a 27–29 record.\n1949–1952: Negro American League.\nAfter integration and the collapse of the Negro National League, the Stars popularity and impact declined dramatically before folding at the end of 1952 season.\nHome ballparks.\nThe team played at Passon Field during the 1934 and 1935 seasons. Passon Field was located at the current site of West Philadelphia High School's athletic field (baseball and football) now called Pollock Field and was the former home of the Philadelphia Bacharach Giants. \nIn 1936, the Stars moved to 44th and Parkside Ballpark where they played the majority of their home games through 1947 when they lost their lease. \nThe Stars often played on Monday nights at Shibe Park which had a higher seating capacity and which was located in North Philadelphia. 24,165 fans saw the Stars defeat Satchel Paige and the Kansas City Monarchs on June 21, 1943.\nAfter 1947, the Stars played home games at area ballparks including Wilmington Park in Delaware, home of the Wilmington Blue Rocks minor-league team.\nLogos and Uniforms.\nThe Stars did not have an official team logo as professional and collegiate teams have today. It was not common practice for teams to have such standardized team symbols in the 1930s and 1940s. The Stars wore uniforms with red and navy blue decoration. The cap most commonly associated today with the Stars is their 1938 cap, seen above, which has a navy crown, red brim, and white star with a red sans-serif P. For most of their history, they wore a white cap with a red brim, and red sans-serif P as seen to the left. Another style cap worn by the Stars was an all navy cap with a red P.\nThe Negro Leagues Baseball Museum (NLBM) created a series of team logos in the 1990s for the well-known Negro league teams so that the NLBM could license such logos and collect royalties for their use on merchandise. Such revenue helps sustain the museum. The Stars were one such team for which a contemporary logo was created. It is seen on NLBM-licensed Stars merchandise and while it supports the educational efforts of the Museum, it is not a historical logo.\nNotable players.\nAll-Star Team Selections.\nThe Negro League Baseball All-Star Game was called the East-West Game. Players were not divided by league, but by geographical location; Stars players played for the East. Players were voted to the teams by the fans with votes tallied by the Chicago Defender and the Pittsburgh Courier newspapers. These Philadelphia Stars appeared in the All-Star game for the East team. &lt;br&gt;\"Only players from the Pittsburgh Crawfords and Washington Elite Giants played for the East in the 1936 game. &lt;br&gt;Two games were played in 1939, 1942, and 1946–1948.\"\nHall of Famers.\nNo player has been enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame with a Stars cap and the following inductees were with the Philadelphia Stars in their career.\nStars co-owner Eddie Gottlieb was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1972 for his pioneering work as a team owner, promoter, and league official."

        "title": "Bob Priddy (baseball)",
        "text": "Robert Simpson Priddy (December 10, 1939 – September 28, 2023) was an American professional baseball player. He was a right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball from 1962 to 1971, with the exception of the 1963 season. Priddy batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . He was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and graduated from high school in nearby McKees Rocks.\nBaseball career.\nAfter signing with his hometown Pittsburgh Pirates in 1959, Priddy spent 13 seasons in professional baseball. Called to the Pirates after the completion of the 1962 minor-league season, he got credit for a victory in his MLB debut. Entering the September 20 game in the ninth inning with the Bucs trailing the Cincinnati Reds 3–1 at Forbes Field, Priddy held Cincinnati off the scoresheet. Then, in the home half of the ninth, Pittsburgh rallied for three runs to claim the victory for Priddy.\nHis next major-league audition came during the 1964 campaign, when he worked in 19 games pitched, all of them in relief, and compiled a 1–2 won–lost record, with one save and an earned run average of 3.93.\nThe Pirates then packaged Priddy in a February 1965 trade, sending him and first baseman Bob Burda to the San Francisco Giants for veteran catcher Del Crandall. The Giants loaned Priddy to the Pirates' Columbus Jets\nTriple-A affiliate for the bulk of the 1965 season, but were able to use him in eight games out of the bullpen. Then, in 1966, Priddy spent his first full season in the majors, working in 38 games for the Giants, including three assignments as a starting pitcher. Although Priddy lost all three starts, they were the only defeats he absorbed all year, going 6–0 as a relief pitcher with one save. San Francisco then used him in an off-season inter-league trade with the Washington Senators to reacquire left-hander Mike McCormick.\nThe 1967 Senators and 1968 Chicago White Sox gave Priddy 26 opportunities as a starting pitcher. Two of Priddy's 1967 starts came against the pennant-bound Boston Red Sox, and he defeated them each time (on June 16 and August 23). But he won only three contests all year, and lost seven decisions, with four saves. The White Sox acquired Priddy in February 1968, and he worked in 114 innings pitched for them, a career high, with 18 starts that season. But he posted a 3–11 won–lost mark, and soon was on the move again, traded to the California Angels on May 14, 1969 in a deal that netted Chicago second baseman Bobby Knoop.\nAfter 15 games with the Angels, and a stint at Triple-A Hawaii, Priddy was acquired by the contending Atlanta Braves on September 8, along with Baseball Hall of Fame knuckleball artist Hoyt Wilhelm; one of the prospects the Angels received in return was Mickey Rivers, then a 20-year-old minor-leaguer. Atlanta turned out to be Priddy's last stop in professional baseball. He worked in 82 games, all in relief, through the 1971 season, won nine games (losing 14) and saved 12 more, with a mediocre ERA of 4.79.\nFor his major-league career, Priddy appeared in 249 games, 220 in relief, and posted a 24–38 (4.00) record with 18 saves and three complete games. In 536 innings pitched, he permitted 518 hits and 198 bases on balls, with 294 strikeouts.\nLater life.\nPriddy died on September 28, 2023, at the age of 83. He is interred at Homewood Cemetery."

        "title": "Royal Rumble (2006)",
        "text": "The 2006 Royal Rumble was the 19th annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown! brand divisions. The event took place on January 29, 2006, in the American Airlines Arena in Miami, Florida. As has been customary since 1993, the Royal Rumble match winner received a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 2006 event, the winner received their choice to challenge for either Raw's WWE Championship or SmackDown!'s World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 22.\nSix professional wrestling matches were featured on the event's supercard, a scheduling of more than one main event. The main feature of the event was the 2006 Royal Rumble match, which featured wrestlers from both brands.\nSmackDown!'s Rey Mysterio, the second entrant, won the match by last eliminating Randy Orton, the thirtieth entrant, also from SmackDown!. The primary match on the SmackDown! brand, which was the main event match of the card, was Kurt Angle versus Mark Henry for the World Heavyweight Championship, which Angle won to retain the title. The predominant match on the Raw brand was Edge versus John Cena for the WWE Championship, which Cena won to win the title.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every January by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, dubbed the \"Big Four\". It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The 2006 event was the 19th event in the Royal Rumble chronology and was scheduled to be held on January 29, 2006, in the American Airlines Arena in Miami, Florida. It featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown! brands.\nThe Royal Rumble match generally features 30 wrestlers. Traditionally, the winner of the match earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For 2006, the winner could choose to challenge for either Raw's WWE Championship or SmackDown!'s World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 22.\nStorylines.\nThe event included matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\".\nPrior to the annual Royal Rumble match, several qualifying matches for the match took place on WWE's flagship television programs. The first three qualifying matches were held on the January 9, 2006 edition of \"Raw\". Chavo Guerrero Jr. defeated Rob Conway, Shelton Benjamin defeated Val Venis and Kane defeated Snitsky, meaning they had earned a place in the Rumble. A Battle Royal also took place on the January 16, 2006 edition of \"WWE Heat\" in addition to a Singles match between Trevor Murdoch and Antonio Thomas, which Murdoch won.\nThe main feud heading into the Royal Rumble on the Raw was between Edge and John Cena, with the two feuding over the WWE Championship. The feud started at New Year's Revolution when Cena won an Elimination Chamber match also involving 5 other superstars to retain the WWE title. Immediately after the match, however, Vince McMahon came out and stated that Edge was cashing in his Money in the Bank contract that he won at WrestleMania 21. Edge then came out with Lita and, two spears later, he pinned Cena to become WWE Champion. Then the next night, Edge held a live sex celebration which got smashed up by Cena and Cena delivered an FU on Lita and sent a message to Edge.\nThe main feud heading into the Royal Rumble on the SmackDown! brand was between Kurt Angle and Mark Henry over the World Heavyweight Championship. The World Heavyweight Championship was originally held by Batista. He defended the title against Henry at a \"SmackDown!\" live event in a steel cage match. Henry was disqualified in the match and Batista retained the title but his triceps were injured. As a result, he was forced to vacate the title on the January 13 episode of \"SmackDown!\". Later on, a 20-man battle royal was arranged to determine the new World Heavyweight Champion. Raw superstar Kurt Angle won the battle royal last eliminating Mark Henry and winning the vacant title thus also starting a rivalry between the two. This also made Angle leave Raw and move to SmackDown!. The next week, Henry defeated Rey Mysterio to become the Number One Contender to Angle's title.\nEvent.\nDark match.\nBefore the event went live on pay-per-view, Finlay defeated Brian Kendrick in a match that aired on \"Heat\".\nPreliminary matches.\nThe opening match was a 6-Way Cruiserweight Open match for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship which was held by Kid Kash at the time. Funaki, Jamie Noble, Nunzio, Paul London, and Raw superstar Gregory Helms joined the match to challenge Kash for the Cruiserweight Championship. A memorable spot from this match was Paul London executing a shooting star press onto all of the challengers. Gregory Helms executed a flying neckbreaker on London. Kid Kash nailed London with a Dead Level. He covered London but Nunzio and Funaki broke up the count. Noble held Funaki in the dragon sleeper. Helms attempted a shining wizard on Noble, but he avoided the move. Helms threw Noble out of the ring and then pinned Funaki after a shining wizard to win the Cruiserweight title.\nThe second match was a divas match between Mickie James and Ashley Massaro. Trish Stratus was the special guest referee for this match. Before the match started, James told Stratus backstage that she loved her. While the match started, Massaro worked over James's arm. While Massaro pounded James into the corner, Stratus pulled James. James would later up work out on Massaro's back and neck. Massaro made a comeback in the match, but finally, James powerbombed her to win the match.\nIn the third match, The Boogeyman faced John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (with his valet Jillian Hall). In the match, JBL tried to do everything to measure out Boogeyman. Finally, JBL had Boogeyman measured and went for the Clothesline from Hell but he missed the move and was sent crashing shoulder first into the post. Boogeyman nailed JBL with a pumphandle slam to win the match. After the match, he tried to throw worms in JBL's mouth but JBL threw his valet Jillian into the ring and Boogeyman threw worms in her mouth.\nThe fourth match was the 2006 Royal Rumble match. Triple H drew as the No. 1 entrant while Rey Mysterio drew No. 2. Mysterio and Triple H fought off each other in the beginning of the match. Later on, the two teamed up to eliminate No. 3 entrant Simon Dean. Mysterio eliminated No. 4 entrant Psicosis on his own. Ric Flair drew No. 5 but he made a mistake by charging Triple H near the ropes. Triple H simply sidestepped the charge and eliminated Flair from the match. No. 6 entrant was Big Show and No. 7 entrant was Jonathan Coachman. Coach was quickly eliminated with a swat of Big Show's hand. Bobby Lashley drew No. 8 while Big Show's World Tag Team Championship partner at the time, Kane drew No. 9, while making made his tenth appearance in a Royal Rumble match, tying the record for most Royal Rumble appearances with Rikishi. It also marked his eighth consecutive appearance in the Royal Rumble as Kane, breaking the previous record of seven consecutive appearances held by himself, Owen Hart and Rick Martel.\nBig Show and Kane teamed up to eliminate Lashley and then the two targeted each other trying to eliminate each other at the ropes. Triple H took the advantage and eliminated both men from behind. In addition, Tatanka and Rob Van Dam returned to WWE television in this Royal Rumble match with Tatanka drawing No. 15 while RVD drawing No. 20. RVD taking down all superstars in the ring (except Mysterio). He went to eliminate Road Warrior Animal, Goldust, and later Carlito. Shawn Michaels entered No. 25 into the match and started attacking his enemies. He went on to eliminate Trevor Murdoch, Johnny Nitro, and Shelton Benjamin.\nAs Michaels eliminated Benjamin from the match, Mr. McMahon's music played which distracted Michaels. McMahon made his way to the ring while Shane McMahon (not an official entrant) eliminated Michaels from behind. Michaels returned to the ring and tried to attack Shane until Triple H beat him and Michaels delivered Sweet Chin Music to Triple H. As a result, Triple H, Mysterio, Carlito, RVD and Randy Orton remained the final five participants. Carlito worked on RVD but RVD countered and threw him out of the ring with the final four participants remaining. Mysterio and RVD formed an alliance against two former Evolution partners Triple H and Orton. RVD tried to perform a five-star frog splash on Orton, but Triple H attacked RVD and then threw Mysterio into RVD which sent RVD crashing to the floor.\nTriple H, Mysterio and Orton were the final three participants. Triple H and Orton teamed to eliminate Mysterio but failed to do so, instead, Mysterio performed a 619 on both men, and then eliminated Triple H from the match. As retaliation, Triple H assaulted Mysterio and threw him into the steel steps, before rolling him back into the ring for Orton to eliminate. Orton tried to eliminate Mysterio, but Mysterio countered and was able to eliminate Orton to win the 2006 Royal Rumble match. Mysterio paid tribute to Guerrero by winning the match saying that he had won the match for Guerrero. Mysterio broke the record for lasting the longest in a Royal Rumble match, 1:02:12. The previous record was 1:01:30, set by Chris Benoit at the 2004 Royal Rumble. Finally, Mysterio was the second person to win from the #2 slot, the first being Vince McMahon in the 1999 Royal Rumble.\nThe fifth match was between Edge and John Cena for the WWE Championship, with Edge defending the title in their New Year's Revolution rematch. Cena entered the ring on a large steel catwalk-like scaffold that had been lowered from the ceiling. Before Cena's entrance, fireworks started throughout the arena. Cena had the match in control in the beginning but later on he was forced to retreat to the floor on multiple occasions. Finally, Cena had enough and followed him, but Edge used Lita as a decoy. Edge speared Cena into the steel ring steps and following a baseball slide which threw Cena into the crowd. Edge remained in control and set Cena on the top rope but was subsequently pushed down. Cena went for a top rope splash but Edge moved away. Cena would make a comeback and try an FU but failed. Cena made a comeback during the conclusion of the match. He went for a Five Knuckle Shuffle but was distracted when Lita jumped on the apron to draw Cena's attention. Edge recovered as Cena and Lita argued, but when Edge charged, Cena sidestepped and Edge ran into Lita. Cena took advantage of the situation and quickly executed an FU on Edge and then put him into an STFU. Edge couldn't escape, so he submitted, making Cena the new WWE Champion.\nThe main event was between Kurt Angle and Mark Henry for the World Heavyweight Championship. Angle defended the title in this match against Henry. The match marked the first time that two former Olympians battled for a world title in history. Angle began the match in trying to put Henry down but instead, Henry dumped him to the floor, where Angle was beaten by former manager Daivari. Henry controlled Angle using his power but Angle managed to apply the ankle lock. After Henry kicked out after an Angle Slam, Angle locked in an ankle lock once more. Daivari distracted the referee and when Henry broke the hold again, he sent Angle crashing into the referee. At that point, Kurt got a chair. Daivari tried to stop him but Angle hit Daivari with the chair. When Angle tried to use the chair, Henry blocked the attempt and tossed Angle to the mat. As Henry advanced though, Angle low blowed Henry, which was followed by two chair shots. Angle went for the pin, but Henry kicked out. Angle untied one of the turnbuckle pads on the middle rope. Angle ended up in that corner, but as Henry charged, Angle sidestepped and tripped him into the exposed steel. Angle rolled up Henry to retain the World Heavyweight Championship but as Angle celebrated, there was all darkness and The Undertaker's music played. Undertaker made his return to WWE television, in his first appearance since Armageddon, entering on a horse-drawn chariot. He intimidated Angle and then the ropes went down and the ring collapsed.\nAftermath.\nChris Benoit and Booker T continued their feud over the WWE United States Championship. Benoit went on to win the title from Booker at No Way Out. Rey Mysterio was awarded a match against Kurt Angle for the World Heavyweight Championship which was scheduled to take place at WrestleMania 22, but before that, Mysterio defended his spot against Randy Orton at No Way Out. Orton won the match and Rey's title shot. Mysterio would later be readded to the match, forming a Triple Threat match between Angle, Mysterio and Orton. At No Way Out, Angle successfully defended the World Heavyweight Championship against The Undertaker, but lost the title to Mysterio at WrestleMania.\nIn February, the \"Road to WrestleMania\" tournament was arranged to determine a new number one contender to John Cena's WWE Championship. This was an eight-man tournament on \"Raw\". Triple H, Rob Van Dam, and Big Show faced each other in the final round of the tournament which was a triple threat match. RVD performed a Five Star Frog Splash on Big Show, but when he made the pin, Triple H pulled the referee. While the referee was distracted, Big Show was able to kick out. Triple H took advantage and performed a Pedigree on RVD to win the tournament and become the number one contender to the WWE Championship. At WrestleMania 22, Cena defeated Triple H to retain the WWE Championship via submission after forcing Triple H to submit to the STFU.\nIn mid-2006, WWE launched a third brand dubbed ECW, which featured wrestlers from the former Extreme Championship Wrestling promotion, as well as newer talent. Additionally, the ECW World Heavyweight Championship was reactivated to be the brand's top championship, and third concurrently active world title in WWE.\nResults.\nRoyal Rumble entrances and eliminations.\n(*) Rey Mysterio broke the longevity record for lasting 1:02:15, previous record held by Chris Benoit (lasting 1:01:35) in Royal Rumble 2004. This record would stand for 17 years (not counting Daniel Bryan lasting for 1:16:05 since it happened in a 50-man version of the Royal Rumble match at the Greatest Royal Rumble) before it would be broken by Gunther (lasting 1:11:40) in 2023.\n(**) Shane McMahon was not a participant in the match."

        "title": "Snap shot (ice hockey)",
        "text": "A snap shot is an abbreviated wrist shot in ice hockey.\nThe purpose of the snap shot is to combine the main advantages of the wrist shot (shot accuracy and quick delivery) and slap shot (puck speed).\nThe snap shot is accomplished with a quick snap of the wrists while the puck rests in place. The difference between a snap shot and a wrist shot is that the stick blade is accelerated towards the puck from a small distance behind it. This allows the player to flex the shaft on the ice and strike the puck at speed – although not to the degree of a full slap shot. The stick is usually not lifted higher than the knee during the shot, which makes this shot legal in most old-timer hockey leagues despite its rapid pace. Snap shots are the most common shot taken when the crease player receives the pass and decides not to one-time the puck.\nThe snap shot is often considered a compromise between the wrist shot and slap shot, and can sometimes be mistaken for one or the other due to its inherently deceptive nature. Consequently, while many players are renowned for their wrist shots (\"e.g.\" Alexei Kovalev, Joe Sakic, Teemu Selänne, Pavel Bure, Paul Kariya) or slap shots (heavy claps) (\"e.g.\" Zdeno Chára, Al MacInnis, Bobby Hull, Brett Hull, Shea Weber, Sheldon Souray), few players are known for exceptional snap shots. Among the players who often score on snap shots are Joe Sakic, Teemu Selänne, Steven Stamkos, Alexander Ovechkin, Ilya Kovalchuk and Phil Kessel."

        "text": "Sindh cricket team was a domestic cricket team in Pakistan representing Sindh province. It competed in domestic first-class, List A and T20 cricket competitions, namely the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, Pakistan Cup and National T20 Cup. The team was operated by the Sindh Cricket Association.\nHistory.\nBefore 2019.\nSindh played its first first-class game in December 1932, when they drew with Ceylon at the Gymkhana ground in Karachi. On 22 November 1935 Sindh and Australia played a three-day match - Figure 1. The match was seen by 5,000 Karachiites. The team played its inaugural season in the Ranji Trophy in 1934. From 1934–35 until 1947–48 Sindh participated in the Ranji Trophy. On 27 December 1947 Sind hosted the first first-class game to be played in Pakistan, but were defeated by an innings and 68 runs by Punjab. The greatest Sindh player in the Ranji Trophy period was Naoomal Jeoomal who played in India's first test match against England at Lord's in 1932. Jeoomal became coach of the Pakistan cricket team in 1960. In Pakistani domestic cricket, Sindh played in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy each season from 1953–54 to 1956–57, but then made only sporadic appearances at first-class level until the 1970s, when two Sindh teams (Sind A and Sind B) competed in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy for several years; the province also played List A cricket. Until 2019, Sindh's last first-class match under that name was a seven-wicket loss in January 1979 against Habib Bank Limited. After that, a \"Sind Governor's XI\" played three games in the 1980s and one in 2000, while a \"Rest of Sindh\" team took part in the 2001–02 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy (finishing bottom of Pool A with no wins from eight games) and One Day National Tournament.\nSince 2019.\nThe team was introduced as a part of the new domestic structure announced by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on 31 August 2019.\nStructure.\nAs of 2019, domestic cricket in Pakistan was reorganised into six regional teams (on provincial lines). A three tier bottom-up system is in operation with the Tier 1 teams participating in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy (First Class), Pakistan Cup (List A) and National T20 Cup (Regional T20). The Tier 2 teams participate in the City Cricket Association Tournament whilst the Tier 3 teams participate in various local tournaments as both tiers feed players to the Tier 1 team. \nSeason summaries.\n2019/20 Season.\nSindh finished in fifth place in both the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy and National T20 Cup. The Pakistan Cup was cancelled this season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n2020/21 Season.\nThe team finished in sixth and third place respectively in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy and the National T20 Cup.

        "title": "List of Indianapolis 500 broadcasters",
        "text": "The Indianapolis 500 has been broadcast on network television in the United States since 1965. From 1965 to 2018, the event was broadcast by ABC, making it the second-longest-running relationship between an individual sporting event and television network, surpassed only by CBS Sports' relationship with the Masters Tournament (since 1956). In 2014, ABC celebrated fifty years televising the Indianapolis 500, not including 1961 through 1964 when reports and highlights of time trials were aired on \"ABC's Wide World of Sports\". Since 2019, the race has aired on NBC.\nFrom 1965 to 1970, ABC televised a combination of filmed and/or taped recorded highlights of the race the following weekend on \"Wide World of Sports\". The 1965 and 1966 presentations were in black-and-white, while all subsequent presentations have been in color. From 1971 to 1985, the Indianapolis 500 was shown on a same-day tape delay basis. Races were edited to a two- or three-hour broadcast, and shown in prime time. Starting in 1986, the race has been shown live in \"flag-to-flag\" coverage. In the Indianapolis market, as well as other parts of Indiana, the live telecast is blacked out and shown tape delayed to encourage live attendance. For 2016, the race was completely sold out, and as such the local blackout was lifted for that year. Since 2007, the race has been aired in high definition.\nCurrently, the television voice of the Indy 500 is Leigh Diffey, who has been working the race since NBC took over in 2019. The last television voice of the Indy 500 for ABC was Allen Bestwick, who held the position from 2014 to 2018. Past television anchors include Chris Schenkel, Jim McKay, Keith Jackson, Jim Lampley, Paul Page, Bob Jenkins, Todd Harris, and Marty Reid. Other longtime fixtures of the broadcast include Jack Arute, Sam Posey, Jackie Stewart, Bobby Unser, and Jerry Punch.\nOn August 10, 2011, ABC extended their exclusive contract to carry the Indianapolis 500 through 2018. Starting in 2014, the contract also includes live coverage of the IndyCar Grand Prix on the road course.\nIn 2019, the Indianapolis 500 moved to NBC, as part of a new three-year contract that unifies the IndyCar Series' television rights with NBC Sports (the parent division of IndyCar's then-current cable partner NBCSN), and replaces the separate package of five races broadcast by ABC. The Indianapolis 500 is one of eight races televised by NBC as part of the new deal, which ended ABC's 54-year tenure as broadcaster of the event. WTHR is the local broadcaster of the race under this contract; the existing blackout policy is expected to continue should the race not sell out. As no spectators were allowed for the 2020 Indianapolis 500, the race was aired live in the Indianapolis market.\nSame-day tape delay coverage.\nFrom 1971 to 1985, the Indianapolis 500 was shown on a same-day tape delay basis. Races were edited down to a between two and three hour broadcast, and shown in prime time. It was also blacked out in the Indianapolis market until a later date. The broadcasts would typically open with the rendition of \"Back Home Again in Indiana\", and the starting command, but no other pre-race ceremonies. In addition, the broadcast was supplemented with some pre-recorded, in-depth featurettes, aired during down times. Later telecasts included live introductions at the top and bottom of the broadcast, with the closing segment sometimes an interview with the race winner, which by that time, had been revealed to the viewers. During this period, the announcers' commentary at both the start and finish of the race were recorded as those events transpired. However, the commentary of the middle parts of the race was semi-scripted, and recorded in post-production, and edited into the broadcast as it was being aired.\n\"Wide World of Sports\" &amp; closed-circuit coverage.\nRace commentary for ABC's \"Wide World of Sports\" broadcasts was recorded during post-production. During the actual running of the race, anchor Jim McKay occasionally served as a roving reporter, recording interviews in the pits and garage area, which was later edited into the broadcast. In some years the broadcast also included highlights of time trials. From 1964 to 1970, the Indianapolis 500 was shown live on closed-circuit television in theaters and other similar venues across the United States. All live closed circuit broadcasts were anchored by Charlie Brockman.\nLocal live coverage.\nThe Indianapolis 500 was first broadcast on television from 1949 to 1950 on WFBM (now WRTV) in Indianapolis. It was done to boost sales of television sets. At the time, there was consideration for the race to be broadcast nationally by 1951 or 1952, possibly through a network syndication arrangement originating through WFBM. After two years, however, the Speedway management decided to eliminate live television coverage, fearful that live local television coverage would hurt gate attendance. Likewise, the cost to expand the broadcast nationally was considered prohibitive. For 1951, WFBM-TV was permitted to televise time trials live, but not the race itself. In future years, local live coverage of time trials would continue in various forms, but the race itself was to be blacked out in the Indianapolis area. Only twice (2016 and 2021) would the local blackout be lifted on race day.\nTime trials and practice.\nABC carried highlights of time trials for the first time in 1961. ABC continued to cover time trials exclusively through the 1970s and early 1980s. In 1987 ESPN began covering portions of time trials. From 1987 to 2008, time trials was aired over a combination of ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2, in varying levels of air time. From 2009 to 2013, time trials was aired on Versus/NBCSN. Time trials returned to ABC in 2014-2018. NBC and NBCSN have aired time trials since 2019.\nIn 1993, ESPN began covering daily practice session, with a wrap-up show each afternoon. The \"Indy Live Daily Reports\" continued through 2006, and in some years were packaged as part of \"RPM 2Night\" or \"SportsCenter\". Since 2009, Carb Day has been aired by Versus/NBCSN. Live streaming of practice began in 2001. Streaming providers have included: Indy500.com official site (2001, 2004), Yahoo! (2002-2003 &amp; 2006), WhiteBoxPC/NeuLion (2009), YouTube (2010-2018), NBC Sports Gold (2019-2020) and Peacock Premium (2021)."

        "text": "Boxing at the 1984 Summer Olympics took place in the Memorial Sports Arena in Los Angeles, California, United States. The boxing schedule began on July 29 and ended on August 11. Twelve boxing events were contested with the participation of 354 fighters from 81 countries. A Soviet-led boycott resulted in the withdrawals of the Soviet Union, Cuba, East Germany, Bulgaria and other Eastern Bloc nations from boxing competitions.\nAt the 1980 Summer Olympics, that was impacted by an American-led boycott, Cuban boxers won 10 medals, with 6 of them being gold, and had again been expected to do well. However, the nation withdrew from the games following the announcement of the Soviet boycott. Teófilo Stevenson, who was going to try for his fourth Olympic gold medal before the boycott was officially announced, had previously defeated Tyrell Biggs twice (one by knockout) and Hermenegildo Báez had previously defeated Henry Tillman. Soviet Alexander Yagubkin defeated both Biggs and Tillman during the USA–USSR duals. Cuban and Soviet boxers, however, were more seasoned than their American counterparts. While US athletes typically turned pro after the Olympics, while still in their early twenties, Cubans and the Soviets were not allowed to do so and stayed on in the amateurs, participating in multiple Olympic cycles.\nEvander Holyfield was controversially disqualified in the Light heavyweight semifinals for punching New Zealand boxer Kevin Barry after what seemed to be a stop. However, replay shows that the referee stopped the bout after his punches. Under IABA health regulation Barry was not allowed to box for 28 days, so he was scratched from the final, giving Yugoslav boxer Anton Josipović the uncontested gold medal. During the medal ceremony, Josipović pulled bronze medalist Holyfield onto the highest step of the podium and raised his hand, acknowledging that Holyfield deserved to compete in the final.\nDue to the increasing size of heavyweight boxers (which put lighter heavyweights at a disadvantage), the Heavyweight division was split in two. The boxers above 200 pounds, were placed in the newly created Super Heavyweight division. "

        "text": "The India national cricket team toured Pakistan for cricket matches during the 2005–06 season. Both India and Pakistan had already played Test matches during this season; India were coming off a 2–0 series win at home over Sri Lanka, while Pakistan beat England by the same margin. In ODI cricket, India's last series, in November 2005, ended in a 2–2 draw with South Africa, while Pakistan beat England 3–2 in December 2005. The tour began on 7 January 2006 with India playing Pakistan A in a non-first class game, and continued till 19 February.\nPakistan's captain, Inzamam-ul-Haq, said that India started as favourites in the Test series, while former fast bowler Sarfraz Nawaz has said that \"it's easy to get them (Indian batsmen) out\". The official ICC Test Championship had India in second place and Pakistan in fourth, while the ICC ODI Championship had Pakistan in the third place and India in the fifth place, at the end of 2005.\nPakistan won the Test series, claiming the third Test after 36 wickets Fall in the first two games combined, while India took the ODI series by a comfortable 4–1 margin.\nTo date, this is the most recent tour by an Indian cricket team of Pakistan.\nTest series.\nTour match: Pakistan A v Indians (7–9 January).\nMatch drawn\nThe Indians won the toss and chose to bat at the Bagh-e-Jinnah in Lahore, and in 77 overs on the first day, they made 298 for four after half-centuries from Gautam Gambhir, Wasim Jaffer, Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar. V. V. S. Laxman and Yuvraj Singh retired after making half-centuries on the second day, and after 27 second-day overs the tourists declared 414 ahead. The Indian seamers Ajit Agarkar and Irfan Pathan got a wicket each in their opening spell, but a 162-run stand between Imran Farhat and Hasan Raza closed the gap. Pathan eventually broke the partnership when Raza, the captain of Pakistan A, was caught behind for 75 off 62 balls, and Farhat was also out shortly afterwards, ending with 107. Faisal Iqbal made 87 for Pakistan A on the final day before they declared on 358 for 9, and Gambhir and Jaffer batted out 13 overs before the game was declared a draw.\nFirst Test.\nDay 1.\nPakistan won the toss, and after losing Salman Butt in a run out with the thirteenth ball of the match, but as Irfan Pathan was the only one to take a wicket, Pakistan built a lead of 326 on the first day of the match in Lahore. The BBC described their batsman as \"dominating India\" in a headline, with Shoaib Malik, Younis Khan and Mohammad Yousuf all passing fifty on the first day.\nSourav Ganguly returned for India, after being left out of the ODI side on recent tours, and the former captain saw action in the first session when he was called upon to bowl four overs of medium pace, but neither he nor any of the two spinners Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble could get a wicket in the morning session, and Malik completed his half-century off 109 balls just before the lunch break when he turned a ball from Kumble around to make two runs. The century stand came up shortly afterwards, before Pathan got the only wicket to a bowler's name on the first day; Malik was caught by Harbhajan for 59 off 145 balls. However, another century stand was to follow - Pakistan were 220 for 2 at tea, and Yousuf and Younis added a further 106 in the evening session, 30 of those coming in the last five overs against the new ball. With five overs remaining on the clock, bad light stopped play, with Yousuf five short of his century; in the previous over, he had been dropped by Sehwag in the gully.\nClose of play: Pakistan 326/2 (Younis Khan 147*, Mohammad Yousuf 95*; 85 overs)\nDay 2.\nPakistan continued to build their first innings total in the morning. Yousuf reached 173 before being stumped off an Anil Kumble delivery. Younis increased his score to 199 before being runout. Shahid Afridi scored a quick century, plundering 27 off a Harbhajan Singh over in the process. This equalled the second highest score off a single over in Test matches. Harbhajan had some small measure of revenge however, taking the catch that dismissed Afridi for 103. Wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal also scored a century, the fastest ever by a wicketkeeper, and Pakistan declared immediately thereafter with a mammoth total of 679 for 7.\nVirender Sehwag and Rahul Dravid opened India's first innings. They successfully withstood 13 overs before bad light stopped play and had scored 65 runs in the process.\nClose of play: Pakistan 679/7d, India 65/0 (Sehwag 36*, Dravid 22*; 13 overs)\nDay 3.\nIn a rain interrupted day reduced to just 15 overs, Sehwag and Dravid advanced India's score to 145, with Sehwag finishing the day on 96 not out.\nClose of Play: India 145/0 (Sehwag 96*, Dravid 37*; 28 overs)\nDay 4.\nSehwag and Dravid continued their partnership throughout the day, with Sehwag recording the second-fastest double century in test history by reaching 200 off 181 balls. By the end of the day Sehwag and Dravid were just 11 runs short of the record opening stand set by India fifty years ago.\nClose of play: India 403/0 (Sehwag 247*, Dravid 128*; 75 overs)\nDay 5.\nIndia resumed at 403 for no wicket and there was no prospect of a result in another interrupted day's play. Sehwag finally fell for 254, leaving India just three runs short of the record partnership. Play was abandoned at the tea interval.\nClose of Play: India 410/1 (Sehwag 254; Dravid 128*)\nSecond Test.\nDay 1.\nBoth sides made two changes, with India dropping Sourav Ganguly and Ajit Agarkar for Zaheer Khan and R. P. Singh, with Agarkar suspected to have a hamstring injury. India elected to choose five bowlers on what was an excellent batting pitch. This is the first time that a Test team has fielded three left-arm fast bowlers. Pakistan dropped Rana Naved-ul-Hasan and the ill Mohammad Sami, with Abdul Razzaq and Mohammad Asif coming in. Pakistan won the toss, batting first to reach 4/379 at stumps with Inzamam-ul-Haq &amp; Shahid Afridi approaching centuries, on 79 and 85 respectively. On a tough day for bowling, R. P. Singh made a promising debut, taking three wickets.\nDay 2.\nPlay resumed on day two with Razzaq replacing Inzamam, who was confined to the dressing room due to a back injury. Afridi reached 156 from just 128 deliveries before being dismissed, ending a combined partnership of 257 with Inzamam and Razzaq. Inzamam returned to complete his century (119), and free-spirited hitting on a benign pitch by Shoaib Akhtar (47) allowed Pakistan to reach 588. R. P. Singh took 4/89, the best bowling figures. India started their reply confidently until Virender Sehwag (31) was dismissed. Captain Rahul Dravid (46*)and V. V. S Laxman (28*) proceeded cautiously to end the day at 1/110.\nDay 3.\nLaxman and Dravid batted fluently throughout the first session to reach lunch at 83 and 97 respectively. India suffered a collapse after lunch, losing 4/45 as Laxman (90), Dravid (103, run out), Sachin Tendulkar (14, walking despite replays suggesting he missed the ball) and Yuvraj Singh (4) were all dismissed. However, MS Dhoni (116*) and Irfan Pathan (49*) counter-attacked to save the follow-on to close at 5/441.\nDay 4.\nDhoni and Pathan continued their partnership until Dhoni (148) was stumped trying to loft Kaneria over midwicket, ending a 210-run partnership. Pathan fell short of a century (90), but the tail wagged (Harbhajan Singh 38, Zaheer Khan 20*) to give India 603, and a slender lead of 15. Pakistan started their second innings confidently, reaching 1/152 at the close with Younis Khan on 64 and Kamran Akmal (opening in place of Shoaib Malik who had returned to Sialkot to be with his gravely ill father) on 59.\nDay 5.\nAkmal was dismissed on 78, but Younis reached his fourth century in as many Tests against India. Along with Mohammad Yousuf (126), they added 262 for the third wicket. The loss of Razzaq (32) and Younis (194) caused a collapse of 5/2 reduced Pakistan to 8/490. This was the end of the innings, as both Inzamam and Malik were unavailable to bat. Zaheer Khan took 4/61. India batted 8 overs to reach 0/21 were the match was drawn.\nAs the game faded away, Indian wicket-keeper MS Dhoni and Pakistani batsman Younis Khan, both infrequent bowlers at international level, took the new ball. R. P. Singh was named the Man of the Match, on his debut."

He was born in Jacksonville, Florida.\nIn 1921, his batting average was reportedly .484. Lundy became the player-manager of the Bacharach Giants from 1925 through 1928, leading the team to two Eastern Colored League pennants (1926, 1927). In the 1926 Colored World Series, Lundy had six RBIs, four runs scored, and six stolen bases. The Giants, however, lost the series. Lundy made one appearance in the East-West All-Star Game, playing shortstop for the East. By this point, he had become part of what was called the \"million dollar infield\", along with Oliver Marcell, Frank Warfield, and Jud Wilson, playing for the Baltimore Black Sox in 1929. His career was often compared to that of Joe Cronin.\nAt age 54, Lundy received votes listing him on the 1952 \"Pittsburgh Courier\" player-voted poll of the Negro leagues best players ever.\nLundy remained in baseball around 33 years, finishing out his baseball career as a manager. He died at age 63 in Jacksonville after a lingering illness. He was among 39 Negro leagues players, managers, and executives who were considered for the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006, but fell short of the necessary 75% vote. Writer Bill James ranked Lundy as the third-greatest shortstop in Negro league history, behind John Henry Lloyd and Willie Wells.\nExternal links.\n and Baseball-Reference Black Baseball stats and Seamheads"

        "text": "The Fiji national rugby sevens team has competed in the World Rugby Sevens Series, Rugby World Cup Sevens and the Olympics. Fiji won the gold medal in the inaugural rugby sevens at the Summer Olympics in 2016 in Brazil, the country's first Olympic medal in any event, and repeated as Olympic champions in the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, defeating New Zealand. Thus Fiji is the sole nation to have won mens Olympic gold in the sport. They are the only country in the world to have won the Sevens Treble (the Olympics, Sevens Series, and World Cup), the three major achievements in Sevens. They have won multiple World Rugby Sevens Series and Rugby World Cup Sevens.\nFiji Sevens is watched and enjoyed by fans around the world for its style of play — the \"Flying Fijians\" play with Fijian flair. Their passing and offloads can be unorthodox for traditional rugby coaching, and more similar to basketball style.\nHistory.\nThe International Rugby Board (IRB) expanded the sevens rugby competition to become a series of 11 tournaments around the world. The debt the FRU incurred from the 2000 sevens series was significant. At the end of December 2000, the FRU was burdened with accumulated losses of F$933,306. Fiji appealed to the IRB for funding, arguing that the sevens tournament was built around Fiji and they would not be able to participate without such funding. From that appeal flowed participation funds that enabled the islands teams to play in the World Sevens Series fully funded. By the end of November 2001, the FRU was sitting on a surplus of F$560,311 compared with the previous year's net loss of F$675,609.\nThe FRU again ran out of money in 2013 to support the national sevens team. The IRB had temporarily suspended funding due to concerns with FRU financial management and governance. The head coach went unpaid for months, another staff was terminated, and the team lacked funds for basic supplies such as rugby balls and bottled water.\nWaisale Serevi is highly regarded as the best player ever in sevens rugby. Nicknamed the \"maestro\", played in this side from 1989 to 2006 leading them to countless tournament victories, two Sevens World Cups in 1997 and 2005.\nWorld Rugby Sevens Series.\nFiji has won the World Rugby Sevens Series four times — first in 2005–06, and most recently in 2018–19. Fiji is one of only two teams — along with New Zealand — to finish in the top four of the World Series every season since its inception.\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nThe following players have been selected to represent Fiji during the 2023–24 SVNS tournament beginning in December 2023.\nRecords and statistics.\nPlayer records.\nThe following section lists player records from the World Rugby Sevens Series.

        "text": "The Hollywoodbets Dolphins are a cricket team representing the KwaZulu-Natal (Coastal) province in South Africa. They take part in the CSA 4-Day Series first-class competition, the Momentum One-Day Cup and the Mzansi Super League T20 competition. The team's home venues are Kingsmead Cricket Ground, Durban and the Pietermaritzburg Oval in Pietermaritzburg.\nHistory.\nThe Dolphins were originally created as an entirely professional franchise team after the South African domestic format was restructured in 2004-05. Up until then eleven provincial teams, with various small changes, had competed in the Currie Cup since 1893-94. \nNatal (as the province was then called) was one of the most successful teams in the 20th century provincial era with twenty title wins. In 1998-99, Natal became KwaZulu-Natal to reflect the political changes that were taking place in the country. The team won one more final title in 2001-02.\nIn 2004-05, the eleven provincial teams were rationalised into six new, entirely professional franchises, in all three formats. The Dolphins were the only squad that did not merge several other provincial teams to form the new side. In the Franchise-era, the Dolphins won only one outright title, with two others being shared wins.\nIn 2020, domestic cricket in South Africa was restructured and the six former franchise teams were dropped. In its place was a return to the more traditional two-division league format, with a total of fifteen professional teams competing due to the previously semi-professional provincial cricket being subsumed (effectively becoming Division 2). \nThe former name of KwaZulu-Natal (Coastal) could have returned during this time (KwaZulu-Natal (Inland) was granted first class provincial status in 2009), however the KwaZulu-Natal Cricket Union decided to maintain the brand recognition from the franchise era, with the new team continuing to be called the Dolphins.\nPlaying kit.\nThe Hollywoodbets Dolphins home kit consists of black shirts and black trousers with green trim during limited overs competitions. The away strip for limited overs competitions is purple shirts and purple trousers with yellow trim.\nSponsors.\nHollywoodbets are the Dolphins' primary shirt sponsors until the end of the 2019/20 season, with local radio station East Coast Radio (ECR 94.5FM) their associate sponsor.\nHonours.\nThe Hollywoodbets Dolphins finished as runners-up in the 2017/18 Ram Slam T20 Challenge, after losing to the Multiply Titans in the final at Centurion.\nThe Hollywoodbets Dolphins reached the final of the 2017/18 Momentum One Day Cup after beating the Cape Cobras in the semi-final. The Dolphins played the Warriors in the final at Kingsmead, however the match was abandoned halfway through the Dolphins first innings due to persistent rain. The rain continued on the reserve day forcing the final to be abandoned, and the trophy was shared between the two teams.\nTeam management.\nImraan Khan (Head Coach), Quinton Friend (Bowling Coach), Mduduzi Mbatha (Fielding Coach), Devon Van Onselen (Strength &amp; Conditioning), Nicholas Moffitt (Physiotherapist), Anderson Ndovela (Manager).\nFormer players.\nFormer Dolphins cricketers include Proteas players Shaun Pollock, Jonty Rhodes, Pat Symcox, Lance Klusener, Andrew Hudson, Errol Stewart, Dale Benkenstein, Imraan Khan, Morné van Wyk, Dane Vilas and Mthokozisi Shezi. Hashim Amla played for the Dolphins for many seasons before moving to the Cape Cobras. Kyle Abbott played for the Dolphins before moving to Hampshire on a Kolpak deal.\nInternational players to play for the Dolphins include Malcolm Marshall, Collis King, Hartley Alleyne, Nixon McLean, Eldine Baptiste, Neil Johnson, Sanath Jayasuriya, Ravi Bopara, Graham Onions and Kevin Pietersen.\nCurrent Proteas cricketers in the Hollywoodbets Dolphins squad include Keshav Maharaj, David Miller, Imran Tahir, Andile Phehlukwayo, Robert Frylinck, Vaughn van Jaarsveld, Khaya Zondo, Senuran Muthusamy and Daryn Dupavillon."

Mario, his friends, and his enemies play golf on a variety of Mario-themed courses. Following \"NES Open Tournament Golf\", it is the second game in the \"Mario Golf\" series. Camelot also developed a Game Boy Color version, which adds role-playing elements.\nThe Nintendo 64 version was re-released on the Wii and Wii U Virtual Console, and on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, in 2008, 2015, and 2022 respectively, while the GBC version was re-released on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in 2012, and on the Nintendo Switch Online service on March 12, 2024.\nGameplay.\nPlayers choose from a variety of characters including Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Wario, and a few original characters. Players can then select from a number of courses which have features adapted to the Nintendo world. As a \"pick up and play\" game, it simplifies the game of golf, without its complicated real-life aspects. Although the game is easy to play and simple in appearance, its engine has many variables that can affect a shot, such as wind strength and direction (indicated by a Boo), rain, characters' individual attributes, spin on the ball, and relief of the land. The variety of gameplay modes include speed golf, ring shot, mini golf, and skins match. Every character in the game has voice samples which can be used to comment on opponents' shots.\nThe Transfer Pak connects the Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color versions, to exchange characters and data. A GBC character earns experience points with each round.\nReception.\nThe Nintendo 64 version received \"universal acclaim\", according to review aggregator website Metacritic. Reviews of the GBC version aggregated slightly stronger than those of the Nintendo 64 version. \"IGN\" called the GBC version \"an absolutely brilliant rendition of golf, and a perfect game for the go\". In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave both versions a score of 30/40."

        "text": "The Central Stags, formerly known as Central Districts, are a first-class cricket team based in central New Zealand. They are the men's representative side of the Central Districts Cricket Association. They compete in the Plunket Shield first-class competition, The Ford Trophy domestic one-day competition and the Men's Super Smash Twenty20 competition. They are one of six teams that make up New Zealand Cricket. They were the fifth of the current teams to compete in the Plunket Shield, which they entered for the first time in the 1950/51 season.\nHistory.\nCentral Districts comprises eight District associations: Hawke's Bay, Horowhenua-Kapiti, Manawatu, Taranaki, Wairarapa and Whanganui in the North Island, and Marlborough and Nelson in the South Island. Previously, many players from these regions competed for Wellington. More than a century before the eventual founding of the Central Districts Cricket Association, the first fully recorded cricket match in New Zealand was played in what is now one of its districts, in Nelson, a men's match in March 1844.\nBetween October 2016 and February 2019, the team set a new Central Districts record for the number of consecutive first-class matches without a defeat, with 21. The previous Central Stags record in the Plunket Shield was 12, while the New Zealand record for most consecutive domestic first-class matches without a loss is 24, set by Wellington (now known as the Wellington Firebirds) between 1984/85 and 1986/87.\nRetired top order batsman Peter Ingram holds the record for the highest individual first-class score for the Central Stags with an innings of 247 in 2008/09, and also scored their second highest individual score with 245 not out in 2009/10.\nThe New Zealand T20 all wickets partnership record is also held by Peter Ingram, having put on 201 for the first wicket with Jamie How at Pukekura Park in 2011/12 against Wellington.\nHow and Jeet Raval share the New Zealand Domestic List A partnership record of 321, set against Northern Districts at Seddon Park in 2012/13, a match in which How became the first player to score a Ford Trophy double century, reaching his hundred in 49 balls and breaking the record that was held by retired Canterbury batsman Peter Fulton.\nOne of New Zealand's greatest batsmen, Ross Taylor, played for the Central Stags. He made his first-class debut for the team as an 18-year-old on 9 January 2003. In 2021/22 at Pukekura Park, Taylor broke the record for the fastest Ford Trophy century, reaching his hundred in 49 balls, breaking the national record that had been held by retired Canterbury batsman Peter Fulton. Taylor played his final match for the Stags in 2022/23.\nIn 2017, Brad Schmulian hit the highest score by any New Zealand cricketer on first-class debut with an innings of 203 for the Central Stags against Northern Districts at Bay Oval. The previous record had stood since the late 19th century.\nIn 2010, Kieran Noema-Barnett set a New Zealand record for the fastest T20 half century, off just 18 balls. In the 2016 Ford Trophy Grand Final, another Central Stags batsman, Tom Bruce, added the record for the fastest one-day half century in New Zealand with his 50 coming off 16 balls.\nTwo batsmen named Ben Smith have played for the Central Stags. Adding to the confusion, both Ben Smith and Ben Smith have scored a first-class double century for the team.\nAmong New Zealand's premier cricketing schools to have produced many Central Stags players are New Plymouth Boys' High School, Palmerston North Boys' High, Napier Boys' High School, Nelson College, Waimea College, Marlborough Boys' College and Whanganui Collegiate.\nThe CEO of Central Districts Cricket Association is a former Central Stags player, Lance Hamilton. In September 2019 former CEO Pete de Wet announced that CDCA had signed renowned international coach Mickey Arthur as the Central Stags T20 coach for the 2019/20 Super Smash season, however Arthur was granted a contract release before the competition began.\nIn 2019/20, the team had a chance to become the first team since 1940 to win the Plunket Shield for three seasons in a row. However, the team was second on the table when the final two rounds of the eight-match season were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Plunket Shield was awarded to the Wellington cricket team, whom they had been about to play at McLean Park, with the Stags declared runners-up.\nIn 2022/23, the team won the first-class Plunket Shield and the List A one-day Ford Trophy in the same season for the first time. The team had previously done the first-class and T20 double in 2019. The team achieved this after both the Ford Trophy Grand Final and the decisive match of the Plunket Shield had been postponed and moved to an alternate venue following Cyclone Gabrielle.\nHonours.\n1953–54, 1966–67, 1967–68, 1970–71, 1986–87, 1991–92, 1998–99, 2005–06, 2012–13, 2017–18, 2018–19, 2022–23\n1984–85, 2000–01, 2003–04, 2011–12, 2014–15, 2015–16, 2022-23\n2007–08, 2009–10, 2018–19\nGrounds.\nCurrent.\nSince 2014–15, Central Districts have used McLean Park, Nelson Park, Napier, Fitzherbert Park and Saxton Oval for first-class matches.

        "title": "Knights (cricket team)",
        "text": "The ITEC Knights are a Division 2 cricket team representing the province of Free State in South African domestic competitions. The Knights take part in the CSA 4-Day Series first-class competition, the Momentum One-Day Cup and the Mzansi Super League T20 competition. The team's home venue is the Mangaung Oval in Bloemfontein.\nHistory.\nThe Knights were originally established as an entirely professional franchise team following reforms that were carried out to the South African domestic leagues in 2004-05. Traditionally, from 1893-94 to 2004-05, eleven provincial teams (with occasional additions) had competed in the Currie Cup. In 2004-05, the eleven provincial teams were rationalised into six new, entirely professional franchises, in all three formats. Griqualand West and Free State were merged to initially form the Diamond Eagles, before rebranding in 2010-11 as the Knights. \nOrange Free State / Free State.\nOrange Free State (as the province was then called) competed in the Currie Cup until 1995-6, without much success. With their first season taking place in 1897-98, Orange Free State had to wait until 1992-93 to secure their first title win. Orange Free State subsequently secured a second title win the following year. From 1995, Orange Free State became Free State in reflection of the political changes that took place in the country during this time. Free State achieved one more title win in 1997-98, as well as continued success in one-day competitions. \nFranchise Era.\nFollowing the 2004-05 domestic reforms, the provincial teams of Griqualand West and Free State were merged to form the Diamond Eagles franchise. The Eagles found success in the first complete franchise season, achieving a shared title win with the Dolphins (formerly Natal / KwaZulu-Natal). An outright, and most recent, 4-day first-class title came in 2007-08. The Eagles also claimed the one-day MTN Championship trophy in 2004-5, 2005-06 and most recently in 2010-11. Success was also quick in coming with the relatively new notion of T20 cricket, winning the Pro20 Series in both 2003-04 and 2005-06. \nThe franchise name was changed for the 2010-11 season across all three formats, with the Eagles becoming the Knights. Like many of the other franchises, sponsorship rights were granted for the beginning of the team name. Until 2021, the official name of the team was the VKB Knights before a new deal was signed, becoming the current ITEC Knights.\nReturn to Provincial Cricket.\nIn 2020, domestic cricket in South Africa was restructured once more and the six former franchise teams were dropped. In its place was a return to the more traditional two-division league format, with a total of fifteen professional teams competing. The previously semi-professional provincial cricket league has been absorbed, effectively forming the leagues second division. Promotion and relegation between the two divisions, not seen since the start of the franchise era in 2004, will return after 2023-24.\nThe former name of Free State could have returned during this time as the Knights are the only representative team from the province. The Free State Cricket Union however decided to maintain the brand recognition from the franchise era, with the new team continuing to be called the Knights.\nPlaying kit.\nDuring the Momentum one-day Cup, the Knights' play in dark blue shirts and trousers with gold accents; for the CSA T20 Challenge they wear dark blue shirts with gold accents and gold trousers with dark blue accents. Their current kit provider is TK Sports.\nSquad.\nPlayers with international caps are listed in bold.\nThis list represents the Knights squad for the 2019/20 season and active amateurs players who have represented them in 2018/19 and 2019/20.\nChampions League Twenty20.\nQualification and first round.\nDiamond Eagles finished second in the 2009 Standard Bank Pro20 and became eligible to play in the 2009 Champions League Twenty20. The team was placed in Group B with New South Wales Blues and Sussex Sharks. The team lost their first match against the New South Wales Blues and were not able to make 100 runs and stayed on 91/9 but the second match went for a tied with Sussex Sharks in which the scores were tied at 119/7 (Sussex) and 119/4(Eagles). Eagles clinched the Super Over. In the Super Over Eagles scored 9/1 while Sussex were knocked of the first two balls by Cornelius de Villiers and the Man of the Match was awarded to Rilee Rossouw.\nSecond round.\nAfter some twists and turns Eagles made it to the next round where they were placed in League A with New South Wales Blues, Somerset Sabres and Trinidad and Tobago. They were counted as a loss to Blues as their previous result and a win against the Somerset Sabres but lost against the Trinidad side in a must-win match. CJ de Villiers again performed well in the game against Somerset CCC. They didn't qualify for the semis but earned 7th out of 12 teams."

The Windies Women later reached the semifinals of the 2022 Women's Cricket World Cup.\nAt the ICC World Twenty20, the side only got to the semi-finals in the 2010, 2012, 2014, 2018 editions of the competition. As well the Windies Women eventually won their first ever title at the 2016 ICC Women's World Twenty20.\nHistory.\nTest history.\nThe first Test series played by the West Indies was at home to Australia in 1975–76, when both the three-day matches were drawn. In 1976–77 the same team then played a six Test series away to India. They lost the fourth and then won the sixth Test by over an innings to level the series. The remaining games were drawn.\n1979 then saw the Windies play their third Test series, this time away to England. However, they fared poorly, losing the first and third Tests and drawing the second to go down 2–0.\nFinally, in 2003–04, after a 24-year wait, the West Indies resumed Test cricket with a one-off match away to Pakistan, this time played over 4 days. The result was a draw.\nOne-Day International history.\nWhen the first World Cup was played in 1973, the West Indies did not compete as an individual unit. Instead a separate team represented Jamaica, and another side represented Trinidad and Tobago. Additionally, three West Indian players participated in an International XI side that also competed in the 1973 World Cup. None of the teams fared well, however, with the International XI finishing in fourth place out of seven with a record of won three, lost two and one no result; Trinidad and Tobago finishing fifth with two wins and four losses; and Jamaica finishing sixth with one win, four losses and one match abandoned.\nThe first one-day internationals (ODIs) played by a combined West Indian side were two games away to England during their 1979 tour. Three ODIs were planned, but the second ODI was washed out without a ball being bowled. In the first ODI, England won comfortably by eight wickets, and in the third ODI saw the West Indies level the series with a two wicket win.\n1993 saw West Indian players compete in a World Cup for the second time, this time as part of a combined team. They finished seventh, with only Denmark and the Netherlands below them, after winning only two and losing five of their seven matches. Their next games were in the 1997–98 World Cup, where they finished in ninth place, above only Denmark and Pakistan. The only match they won was the 9th place play-off game against the Danes.\n2002–03 saw the Sri Lankan women's cricket team tour the West Indies and play a six-match ODI series, which the Sri Lankan's won six-nil. The closest match was the fourth, where the Windies went down by only 9 runs. 2003 saw the Windies greatest cricketing success, when they finished second in the International Women's Cricket Council Trophy, after winning four and losing one of their five games. The Trophy was competed for by the weaker ODI sides – Ireland, Windies, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Scotland and Japan.\n2003–04 saw the Windies play five ODIs in India followed by a seven ODI and one Test tour to Pakistan. All five games against India were lost comfortably. As expected, the tour to Pakistan was more successful and the ODI series was won five-two.\nThey finished fifth in the 2004–05 World Cup, ahead of Sri Lanka, South Africa and Ireland, but behind Australia, India, New Zealand and India. They won two and lost three games, with one no result and one abandoned match. After being eliminated from the World Cup, the team stayed on to play three ODIs against South Africa and won the series two-nil.\nSquad.\nThis lists all the active players who have either played for West Indies in the past 12 months, was named in the most recent ODI or T20I squad, or is Centrally contracted by Cricket West Indies.\nUncapped players are listed in \"italics\".\n\"Updated as on 8 July 2023\"\nNote - Deandra Dottin was also awarded a central contract but has since retired from international cricket."

Slater played his last game for Geneva on March 7, 2017 in game 2 of the 1/4 finals, before being taken out of the lineup as a healthy scratch. Cody Almond assumed the captaincy as Vukovic was suspended.\nOn July 21, 2017, as a free agent, Slater agreed to a one-year contract with HC Fribourg-Gottéron of the National League (NL). He spent two seasons with the club, skating in 93 games.\nOn September 3, 2018, Slater was named to Michigan State's staff as a volunteer assistant coach, effectively ending his professional hockey career.\nOn September 20, 2019, he joined the Washington Capitals' Player Development Department.\nPersonal life.\nHis father, Bill Slater, was a defensive lineman in the National Football League (NFL) for the Minnesota Vikings and the New England Patriots."

Carter played college football for the Florida Gators, earning All-American honors. A first-round pick in the 1995 NFL draft, he played in the NFL for the St. Louis Rams, Tennessee Titans, Miami Dolphins, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nEarly years.\nCarter was born in Miami, Florida. He attended Lincoln High School in Tallahassee, Florida, and was a letterman for the Lincoln Trojans high school football and basketball teams. In football, he was a \"Parade\" magazine high school All-American. Carter was a saxophone player in the marching band until he started his first season of football as a junior. He was a member of the school's Crime and Drug Prevention Task Force and was named Student-Athlete of the Year as a senior.\nCollege career.\nCarter accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he was a four-year letterman for coach Steve Spurrier's Florida Gators football team from 1991 to 1994. During his four seasons as a Gator, the team won three Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships (1991, 1993, 1994).\nIn his freshman season, Carter played in eleven games and started two, and tallied fourteen tackles. Following his sophomore season in 1992, he was a second-team All-SEC selection and a \"Football News\" honorable mention All-American after compiling sixty-four tackles (thirty-eight solo), twelve forced quarterback hurries, 3.5 sacks, and six tackles for a loss. As a junior in 1993, he made fifty-nine tackles (11.5 for losses), 6.5 sacks, twelve pressures and blocked a field goal, and was recognized as a first-team All-SEC Selection.\nAs a senior in 1994, Carter was a first-team All-SEC selection and a consensus first-team All-American. \"Football News\" named him one of five finalists for its 1994 Defensive Player of the Year Award, and he was a semifinalist for the 1994 Lombardi Award, presented to the nation's top lineman. His 42.5 career tackles for a loss and 21.5 quarterback sacks ranked seventh and fifth, respectively, in Gators history. Carter's 11.5 sacks in 1994 were then the third-best seasonal total in school history. He started thirty-eight of his last thirty-nine games at defensive end.\nCarter served as president of the University of Florida chapter of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. In 2000, Carter was voted to the Florida Gator All-Century Team and in 2006 he was voted to the University of Florida Gator 100th Anniversary Team. Carter was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a \"Gator Great\" in 2004.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nAt the University of Florida Pro Day, Carter ran a 4.66 40-yard dash at 274 pounds while recording a vertical jump of 36½ inches.\nSt. Louis Rams.\nThe St. Louis Rams selected Carter in the first round (sixth pick overall) of the 1995 NFL Draft. He signed a contract with the Rams for a reported $10 million over six years.\nDuring his rookie year with the Rams, Carter ranked second on the team and second among rookies with six sacks, while posting 50 tackles, two forced fumbles, one safety and one fumble recovery. He was named the Rams' Rookie of the Year. He recorded his first career sack when he dropped Brett Favre for a 10-yard loss in Green Bay (9/3/1995). He tallied first career safety when he sacked New York Jets quarterback Boomer Esiason in end zone (12/3/1995).\nIn 1998, Carter led the team in sacks with twelve and tied for sixth in the NFC, earning him the Daniel F. Reeves Memorial Award as the Rams' Most Valuable Player. He was also a Pro Bowl alternate.\nHis best season as a pro came in 1999 with the Rams when he tallied a career high 17 quarterback sacks which led the NFL and was the highest sack total by a Ram since Jack Youngblood collected 18 sacks in 1979. These efforts earned him a spot on the 1999 Pro Bowl team. He also became the first defensive end to represent the Rams at Pro Bowl since Youngblood in 1979. Carter was a consensus All-Pro selection in 1999, in addition to being named to the All-Madden and Phil Simms' All-Iron Teams. The 1999 Rams defense, anchored by Carter at left defensive end, had the No. 1-ranked rushing defense in the NFL (74.3 ypg) and led the NFL in quarterback sacks with fifty-seven (tied with the Jacksonville Jaguars).\nCarter (7.5 sacks in the month of November) was recognized as the NFC Defensive Player of the Month and earned NFC Defensive Player of the Week honors in Week Eight versus the Carolina Panthers. He and his teammates ended the 1999 regular season with a 13–3 record and were Super Bowl XXXIV champions. Carter made one of the Rams' sacks in the Super Bowl XXXIV win over the Tennessee Titans.\nIn 2000, Carter totaled 10.5 sacks and started thirteen of the sixteen games he played for the Rams. In 2000, for the first time in his career, Carter moved to defensive tackle in the Rams' nickel defense, with Leonard Little playing the left defensive end position. After the 2000 season he was traded to the Tennessee Titans in exchange for a 2001 first-round draft choice on April 4, 2001, later used on Ryan Pickett.\nTennessee Titans.\nCarter was traded to the Titans in 2001 and continued the same stellar performances he had with the Rams. During his first season, he recorded 61 tackles and two sacks and led the team with 34 quarterback pressures. Carter had 10 sacks and was voted to his second Pro Bowl in 2002 and named second-team All-Pro by \"Football Digest\".\nIn 2003, he started all 16 games, and led the Titans linemen with 79 tackles. He added 5.5 sacks, one forced fumble and a pass defensed. Played both end and tackle and was instrumental in helping Tennessee to the No. 1-ranked rushing defense in the NFL (80.9 yards per game), marking the second time in his career that Carter played on the NFL's top-ranked rushing defense. Although Carter did not gain any individual honors, his play was noticed by opposing NFL coaches. In December 2003, \"Pro Football Weekly\" reported, \"Patriots head coach Bill Belichick argued that DL Kevin Carter—who starts at the DLE spot and plays inside on passing downs—could be considered for league MVP.\"\nIn 2004, Carter started all 16 games for the Titans, however, seven were at his usual left defensive end position and nine were at left defensive tackle. Posted a career-high and team-leading 82 tackles while sacking the quarterback 6 times while recovering one fumble and forcing one fumble and batting away two passes. His contract was terminated by Tennessee on February 22, 2005, after earning $20.5 million in his four seasons with the Titans.\nMiami Dolphins.\nCarter was signed by Miami on March 7, 2005. In 2005, Carter started all 16 games at left defensive end for the Dolphins and totaled 54 tackles, six sacks, four passes defensed, one fumble recovery, and one forced fumble. His sack total tied with David Bowens for second on the team. He notched the second safety of his career in win at New Orleans (October 30, 2005) when he sacked Saints quarterback Aaron Brooks in the end zone.\nThe following season (2006) Carter again started all 16 games for the Dolphins, marking the sixth consecutive season that he started all 16 contests. Carter had 45 tackles, 5.5 sacks and two fumble recoveries. New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick said this about Carter and the Dolphins' front four, \"When they get to third down, they put Vonnie Holliday inside with Kevin Carter, and [David] Bowens and Jason Taylor on the edge, it's the best pass rushing group I think we've seen all year across the board. Every one of those guys can definitely rush.\"\nCarter's contract was terminated by Miami on March 2, 2007. Carter's release came after he was unable to reach an agreement on a restructured contract with Miami. Carter earned $10 million in his two seasons with Miami.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nThree days after his release by the Dolphins, on March 5, 2007, Carter signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Carter played sixteen games while starting fourteen for the Bucs in 2007, compiling forty-three tackles, three sacks and one forced fumble. Carter was released on February 27, 2008, in what was described as a \"cost-cutting\" move. However, on March 25, 2008, Carter re-signed with the Bucs. He reportedly turned down a two-year deal with the Oakland Raiders to sign a one-year $3.5 million deal with Tampa Bay. Carter had earned $5.2 million in 2007 with the Buccaneers and would have earned $5.8 million in 2008 ($3.8 million plus a $2 million roster bonus). Carter's agent stated, \"It was big money he turned down (from Oakland), but he went with heart rather than the pocket\". Carter has a chance to be the Bucs' starting left end in 2008, but he'll likely come off the field on passing downs. He registered forty-nine tackles and four sacks while starting every game for the Buccaneers in 2008. Carter earned $8.7 million in his two seasons with the Bucs. After the 2008 season, the Buccaneers chose not to resign Carter, who was a free agent, and on April 28, 2009, Carter visited the Detroit Lions seeking a contract. After passing on the Lions offer, Carter remained an unsigned free agent and subsequently retired from football.\nIn his fourteen-season NFL career, Carter, never missing a game, played in 224 regular season games, starting in 219 of them. He totaled 104.5 career sacks, reaching double digits four times (1998–2000, 2002) and leading his team five times (1996, 1998, 1999, 2002, 2004). He earned just over $49 million during his career.\nPersonal life.\nCarter is active in community endeavors. He and his wife, Shima, established the Kevin Carter Foundation in 2002, which is an organization created to enrich the lives of children, focusing on youth and character development. One of Carter's favorite quotes from his father is: \"To whom much is given, much is expected\" and he founded his organization on that principle.\nFor the past eleven years, Carter has hosted the \"Waiting for Wishes\" celebrity dinner and reception, where he and his teammates, along with Hollywood stars and musicians have come together to be the waiters and waitresses for dinner attendees. The annual dinner has generated thousands of dollars for the Make-A-Wish Foundation and the Kevin Carter Foundation. Carter was named the Community Man of the Year Award for three straight years by his Titans' teammates, and while he was with the Rams, he was named a United Way African American Leadership Giver.\nIn 1998, Carter founded the Kevin Carter Football Endowment at the University of Florida, which provides scholarships to deserving college athletes. He also serves on the NFL Players Association Executive Committee."

During his time at BC High, Leahy set a school record for points in career (with 140), was named to the Boston Globe and Boston Herald Dream Teams as a senior, and was honored with the titles of team captain and MVP.\nAfter being drafted in the 5th round, 122nd overall, at the 1998 NHL Entry Draft by the New York Rangers, Leahy spent 4 years playing college hockey for Miami University in Oxford, Ohio before he turned pro in 2001.

        "text": "William Mitchell (born April 23, 1977) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman. He is known primarily as a physical defensive defenceman. Mitchell played Junior A in the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL) and Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League (SJHL) before joining the college ranks with the Clarkson Knights of ECAC Hockey in 1997. He won an ECAC championship with Clarkson in 1999, while also earning playoff MVP and ECAC First Team All-Star honours.\nSelected by the New Jersey Devils in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft, he played two seasons with the Albany River Rats of the American Hockey League (AHL) while earning limited playing time with the Devils over two seasons. In 2001, he was traded to the Minnesota Wild where he played four seasons before a brief stint with the Dallas Stars. He signed with the Vancouver Canucks in the 2006 off-season and was named the team's top defenceman twice, in 2008 and 2009. After four seasons in Vancouver, Mitchell signed with the Los Angeles Kings in August 2010. While with Los Angeles, Mitchell won two Stanley Cups (2012 and 2014) before signing with the Florida Panthers in the 2014 off-season.\nInternationally, he has represented Team Canada once at the 2004 World Championships, capturing a gold medal.\nEarly life.\nMitchell was born on April 23, 1977, to Reid and Nadija Mitchell. He has a sister named Chantal. His father is a retired heavy-duty mechanic with Western Forest Products, while his mother is a Croatian-born immigrant who retired as a terminal service agent for B.C. Ferries. Mitchell's grandfather, Les Mitchell, played amateur senior hockey and once earned a tryout with the New York Rangers during the Original Six-era. His grandfather, Les, scored the championship-winning goal for the Nanaimo Clippers in 1945. Les Mitchell was reportedly the last person to skate on the ice at the Civic Arena in Nanaimo before it was torn down.\nMitchell was born and raised in Port McNeill, British Columbia, a small logging town on Vancouver Island. He grew up working on the docks in his hometown unloading fish and cleaning equipment. He first began skating at the age of four and took figure skating. Growing up as a Vancouver Canucks fan, his father would take him across to the mainland to see games at the Pacific Coliseum. He played minor hockey as a winger with the North Island Eagles and won back-to-back double-A provincial titles in pee wee and bantam with the club. At the age of 15, he left home after being recruited to play for Athol Murray College of Notre Dame, a high school in Wilcox, Saskatchewan. It was there that he switched from wing to defence. He played with the Notre Dame Hounds' midget team of the Saskatchewan Midget Hockey League (SMHL) and recorded 15 points over 31 games in 1993–94. From there, he earned an athletic scholarship with Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York.\nPlaying career.\nJunior and college hockey (1994–99).\nAs a junior hockey player, Mitchell began in the BCHL with the Kelowna Spartans in 1994–95, recording 11 points over 42 games. After one season with Kelowna, he joined the Melfort Mustangs of the SJHL. Following his first season with Melfort in 1995–96, he was selected by the New Jersey Devils in the eighth round, 199th overall, in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft. He returned to Melfort for a second season and recorded 56 points in 64 games to earn the Top Defenceman Award and SJHL First All-Star Team honours.\nBeginning in 1997–98, Mitchell began two seasons of college hockey with Clarkson University Golden Knights of the ECAC. In his freshman year, he recorded 26 points over 34 games, fourth among league defencemen, and was named co-Rookie of the Year with Clarkson teammate Erik Cole. He also earned ECAC All-Rookie and ECAC Second All-Star honours. Clarkson advanced to the ECAC Tournament Final against Princeton University, but lost 5–4 in double overtime. The following season, Mitchell led all Golden Knights defencemen in scoring with 29 points (10 goals and 19 assists) and a +13 rating in 34 games. He finished the season with a league player of the week recognition on March 1, 1999. As Clarkson met Princeton in the 1999 ECAC Semi-final, Mitchell scored the game winning goal with a slap shot from centre ice with three seconds remaining in regulation. Clarkson went on to defeat St. Lawrence University 3–2 in the final to capture the ECAC championship. Mitchell earned tournament MVP honours and was also named to the ECAC First All-Star Team and NCAA East Second All-American Team.\nNew Jersey Devils (1999–2001).\nFollowing his sophomore season with Clarkson, Mitchell decided to forgo his final two seasons of college eligibility to turn professional in the New Jersey Devils system. He played the final six games of the 1998–99 AHL season with the Devils' minor league affiliate, the Albany River Rats, registering a goal and three assists.\nIn his first Devils' training camp in September 1999, he broke a finger in his left hand during a fight in a rookie game against the Boston Bruins. The injury required three pins to set the finger in place. Although sidelined, the Devils signed him to a rookie contract in September 1999. After recovering, he was assigned to the River Rats. Mitchell received a call-up late in the season and made his NHL debut on March 27, 2000, in a 5–2 loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs. He stayed with the Devils for a week before being returned to the AHL. He finished the 1999–2000 season with 19 points over 63 games with the River Rats and no points in two games with the Devils.\nThe following season, Mitchell made the Devils' opening lineup, but was a regular healthy scratch. After appearing in 11 games, he was returned to the AHL on November 22, 2000. He registered his first NHL point, an assist, during his initial stint. After injuries to Devils defencemen Scott Niedermayer and Brian Rafalski, Mitchell was recalled on February 10, 2001. The following month, after having been sent back down to the AHL, he was traded to the Minnesota Wild on March 4, 2001, in exchange for defenceman Sean O'Donnell.\nMinnesota Wild and Dallas Stars (2001–06).\nFollowing the trade, Mitchell became a full-time NHLer, playing in 17 games with the Wild to finish the season. He completed his rookie NHL season with a goal and 10 assists over 33 games between the Devils and Wild. In his first full season with the Wild in 2001–02, he recorded three goals and 13 points in 68 games, while earning $550,000 from his initial rookie contract with the Devils. He missed 14 games due to three separate shoulder, groin and wrist injuries. Establishing himself as a top-four defenceman on the team, paired with Brad Bombardir, Mitchell ranked third on the team in average ice time with 21:25 minutes per game. The following season, he improved to a third-ranked plus-13 on the team after going –16 the previous season. He went on to help the club make a run in the 2003 playoffs to the semi-finals, leading the team with a +5 rating in 18 post-season games. He suffered a cheekbone injury during the first round against the Colorado Avalanche that required him to wear a fully visored helmet for the remainder of the playoffs. After defeating the Avalanche and Vancouver Canucks in the first two rounds, the Wild were eliminated in four games by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the semi-finals.\nIn the off-season, he was re-signed to a one-year contract by the Wild on August 11, 2003. He recorded 14 points over 70 games in 2003–04, while leading the Wild with a +12 rating and ranking second in average ice time at 22:35 minutes per game. Minnesota failed to qualify for the playoffs.\nOn June 30, 2004, the Wild tendered Mitchell a qualifying offer, but he later filed for arbitration on July 7. The two sides avoided arbitration by agreeing on a one-year, $1.775 million deal on August 12, 2004. However, due to the NHL lockout, Mitchell was inactive in 2004–05. With NHL play set to resume for 2005–06, he re-signed with the Wild to another one-year, $1 million contract on August 9, 2005. In December 2005, he was named team captain as part of the Wild's monthly rotating captaincy (he was then succeeded by Brian Rolston in February 2006).\nAt the 2005–06 NHL trade deadline, Mitchell was traded away to the Dallas Stars as a rental player in exchange for defencemen Martin Škoula and Shawn Belle on March 9, 2006. Mitchell closed the season playing 16 games and one playoff round with Dallas before becoming an unrestricted free agent in the off-season.\nVancouver Canucks (2006–2010).\nOn July 1, 2006, the Vancouver Canucks signed Mitchell to a four-year, $14 million contract. Canucks General Manager Dave Nonis had previously attempted to acquire him at the previous season's trade deadline before he was sent to Dallas. His acquisition as a free agent followed the signings of goaltender Roberto Luongo and head coach Alain Vigneault, which reflected an effort from Nonis to develop a defence-first system.\nEarly in the 2006–07 season, Mitchell suffered a concussion on October 23 and missed nine games. He then missed 11 more games due to a recurring groin injury in February and March 2007. He finished his first season with the Canucks recording a goal and 11 points in 62 games. His 4:57 minutes of average shorthanded ice time per game ranked third in the NHL behind Derian Hatcher and Adam Foote. He helped the team to the second round of the 2007 playoffs, where they were defeated by the Anaheim Ducks in five games.\nDuring his second season with Vancouver, he missed ten games with a fractured vertebra. The injury was sustained on December 31, 2007, in a loss to the Calgary Flames, while trying to dodge a check. However, Mitchell continued to play with the injury for nine games afterwards. He recorded two goals and 12 points, while leading the team with 108 blocked shots and 1,646:20 minutes in total ice time. At the end of the 2007–08 season, he was awarded his first Babe Pratt Trophy as the Canucks' top defenceman.\nWith the departure of long-time Canucks captain Markus Näslund to free agency in the 2008 off-season, Mitchell was considered a leading candidate for captaincy. The Canucks instead appointed team MVP Roberto Luongo as the first goaltender to be a captain since 1947–48 on September 30, 2008. Mitchell was named alternate captain along with forward Ryan Kesler and defenceman Mattias Öhlund. Due to Luongo's limitations as a goaltender, Mitchell was designated the captain's traditional role of disputing calls by the officials and relaying messages to the coach.\nDuring the subsequent 2008–09 season, Mitchell recorded career-highs with three goals, 20 assists, 23 points and a team-best +29 rating, earning his second consecutive Babe Pratt Trophy. He added two assists and led all Canucks in average ice time at 24:12 minutes per game in the post-season. He helped the Canucks advance to the second round, where they were eliminated by the Chicago Blackhawks in six games.\nEarly on in the 2009–10 season, Mitchell delivered an open-ice hit that concussed Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews in the two teams' first game against each other since the 2009 playoffs. Mitchell had just exited the penalty box when he caught Toews with his head down receiving a pass in the neutral zone; the hit was deemed legal as Mitchell checked Toews with his shoulder. Toews was sidelined for six games as a result. Later on in the season, Mitchell suffered a concussion himself, receiving a hit from opposing forward Evgeni Malkin, causing his head to hit the end boards, during a game against the Pittsburgh Penguins on January 16. He was sidelined for the remainder of the season with post-concussion syndrome, finishing with 12 points and a +13 rating in 48 games.\nUnsure if the injury had ended his career, Mitchell later recalled his subsequent recovery as \"the toughest year of [his] life.\" Not speaking to the media until after the Canucks were eliminated in the playoffs, he expressed criticism towards both Malkin for the hit resulting in his concussion and to NHL Senior Vice President Colin Campbell for not taking any disciplinary action. He denounced Campbell for being \"inconsistent...hand[ing] down suspensions and fines on result [instead of the nature of a hit],\" as Mitchell's injury was not immediately apparent following the game.\nMitchell's four-year deal with the Canucks expired on July 1, 2010, and he became an unrestricted free agent. Mitchell was still involved in negotiations with Vancouver to re-sign, but concerns over his head injury, as well as the new defensive acquisitions of Keith Ballard and Dan Hamhuis in the off-season factored against the possibility of remaining with the Canucks.\nLos Angeles Kings (2010–2014).\nOn August 25, 2010, Mitchell signed a two-year deal worth $3.5 million per season with the Los Angeles Kings. He had interest from several other teams, including the Washington Capitals and San Jose Sharks. The Canucks were also offering a one-year contract between $1.8 and $2 million, but were not willing to match the Kings' deal. Mitchell expressed disappointment in leaving the Canucks, but stated he was \"looking forward to going to a team which, I get the feeling, is really passionate about having me there.\"\nMitchell began the season on a defensive pairing with Drew Doughty. Nearly a month into the campaign, he notched his first goal as a King, scoring short handed against the Dallas Stars in a 5–2 victory on October 28, 2010. In November 2010, he sustained a wrist injury during a game against the Nashville Predators, sidelining him for 12 games. After recovering, he suffered a knee injury, keeping him from another 11 games. Later in the season, during a game against the Phoenix Coyotes, on March 3, 2011, Mitchell was hit in the face by a shot from opposing forward Kyle Turris, requiring 53 stitches. He did not miss any additional games, however. Mitchell finished the season with five goals and five assists over 57 games, ranking third in average ice time per contest with the Kings. He added a goal and an assist in six playoff games as the Kings were eliminated by the San Jose Sharks in the first round. On February 24, 2012, Mitchell signed a two-year contract extension with the Kings. In the 2012 playoffs, Mitchell helped the Kings defeat the Vancouver Canucks in the first round, the St. Louis Blues in the semi-finals (winning four games straight) and the Phoenix Coyotes in the Conference Finals. The Kings made the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 1993 and defeated the New Jersey Devils; this also marked Mitchell's first appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals. Mitchell was the second player, after team captain Dustin Brown, to hoist the Cup after the win.\nDuring the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Mitchell began having knee problems, requiring a first surgery to clean up debris and a second surgery after re-injuring the knee during rehabilitation prior to the 2012–13 King's training camp. Mitchell was out for the remainder of the 2012–13 season and questionable for the 2013–14 season.\nMitchell did return alongside Slava Voynov in the 2013–14 season. Mitchell missed a handful of games in the second round of the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs due to an injury, but returned to beat the Chicago Blackhawks in the Western Conference Finals and win his second Stanley Cup over the New York Rangers. He scored a goal in Game 2 of the Finals, and also assisted on Dustin Brown's double-overtime goal later in the same game.\nFlorida Panthers (2014–2016).\nWith the Kings facing cap constraints, Mitchell was not retained as a free agent. On July 1, 2014, he signed a two-year $8.5 million contract with the Florida Panthers. On October 6, 2014, Mitchell was named the eighth captain in Florida Panthers history.\nOn February 3, 2015, Mitchell was placed on injury reserve for a little more than a month, until a game against the New York Islanders in March.\nMitchell missed the final 42 games of the 2015–16 NHL season largely over concern what another brain injury would mean to his long-term health.\nInternational play.\nMitchell has made one international appearance for Canada in his career. After the Minnesota Wild failed to qualify for the 2004 playoffs, he was named to the national team for the 2004 World Championships in the Czech Republic. He was joined on the squad by Wild teammate Nick Schultz in the first group of players chosen by General Manager Jim Nill on April 5, 2004. Appearing in nine games, Mitchell helped Canada to a gold medal, defeating Sweden 5–3 in the final.\nPlaying style.\nMitchell plays in the style of a stay-at-home defenceman. While with the Vancouver Canucks, he established himself as their top shutdown defenceman, being matched up against opposing teams' best players and spending significant time on the penalty kill. He had usually formed a defensive pairing on the Canucks with the often offensive-minded Kevin Bieksa. Bieksa has credited Mitchell with teaching him to be more aware of game situations before jumping into the rush.\nIn order to defend effectively, Mitchell opts to use a longer-than-usual hockey stick. Prior to a game against the Calgary Flames on February 17, 2009, opposing head coach Mike Keenan accused Mitchell of playing with an illegal hockey stick. Mitchell responded by asserting he used the league maximum length at 63 inches.\nMitchell is also known for his leadership qualities, serving as an alternate captain on the Canucks. During his tenure with the Minnesota Wild, he was named captain for the months of December 2005 and January 2006 as part of the Wild's rotating captaincy system. At the start of the 2014–15 season, Mitchell was also named the captain of the Florida Panthers.\nPersonal life.\nMitchell married his wife Megan, a Minnesota native, on August 17, 2006, in Napa Valley, California. They reside in the Yaletown neighbourhood in downtown Vancouver, while returning to Mitchell's hometown of Port McNeill during the summer, where he fishes avidly. During the 2015–16 NHL season, Panthers rookie Aaron Ekblad lived with Mitchell and his wife.\nMitchell is an active philanthropist around the Port McNeill community. In 2004, he hosted the first Willie Mitchell Classic, a celebrity golf tournament to raise scholarship funds for high school students around his hometown. He has also regularly donated game-used equipment to fundraise for his former minor hockey team, the North Island Eagles.\nIn the summer of 2009, Mitchell threw the first pitch at a Seattle Mariners game against the Toronto Blue Jays at Safeco Field in Seattle, Washington.\nIn 2014, Mitchell was a VIP guest, sitting at the blue team's chef's table in \"Hell's Kitchen\".\nMitchell and wife, Megan welcomed their first child, a son named Paxton, on May 4, 2017.\nOn September 14, 2022, the Tofino Resort and Marina, co-owned by Mitchell, announced the cancellation of their Race for the Blue fishing tournament and temporary closure of the 1909 Kitchen and Bar as a result of allegations of inappropriate behavior by members of staff."

        "title": "Joe Hamilton (American football)",
        "text": "Joseph Fitzgerald Hamilton (born March 13, 1977) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL), NFL Europe and Arena Football League (AFL). He played college football for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, earning consensus All-American honors and winning the Davey O'Brien Award in 1999. After his playing career ended, Hamilton became an administrator and coach. He has served as the running backs coach for Georgia State University and currently works in the recruiting department for his alma mater, Georgia Tech.\nCollege career.\nHamilton accepted an athletic scholarship to attend Georgia Tech, where he played for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team from 1996 to 1999. He set Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) career records for total offense (10,640 yards), touchdown passes (65) and total touchdowns (83). As a senior in 1999, he was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American, won the Davey O'Brien Award, and was a finalist for the Heisman Trophy, finishing as the runner-up in the Heisman voting behind Wisconsin running back Ron Dayne. In 2002, he was named as one of the fifty members of the ACC 50th Anniversary Football Team. Hamilton was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2014.\nProfessional career.\nDue to his lack of prototypical height for an NFL quarterback (standing just 5'10\"/1.78 m), he fell to the 7th round of the 2000 NFL Draft before being drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In three years with the Buccaneers he only played four downs in a single regular-season game. In 2002, the Buccaneers allocated Hamilton to NFL Europe, where he led the Frankfurt Galaxy to 5-2 record in 2002 before suffering a torn ACL. He spent the entire 2002 NFL season on injured reserve and was released by the Buccaneers at the end of the season. He received a Super Bowl ring following the Buccaneers' victory in Super Bowl XXXVII.\nHe signed with the Arena Football League's Orlando Predators in 2004 and guided the team to a 9-5 record and the playoffs, despite suffering another knee injury and missing two and a half games.\nHe was then signed by the Indianapolis Colts in 2004, reuniting with former Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy, but only saw limited action in one game before being released during the season.\nHe returned to the Orlando Predators where he was the starting quarterback through the 2006 season. He has a 32-15 record as the Predators' starter and led them to ArenaBowl XX in 2006, losing 69-61 to the Chicago Rush. With a win, Hamilton would have become the first player in history to own both a Super Bowl and ArenaBowl ring.

        "text": "Derek Terrence Morris (born August 24, 1978) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman who played over 1,100 games in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Calgary Flames, Colorado Avalanche, Phoenix Coyotes, Boston Bruins and New York Rangers. He was originally drafted out of the Western Hockey League (WHL) 13th overall by the Calgary Flames in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft.\nPlaying career.\nMorris played minor hockey in the Alberta Midget Hockey League (AMHL) with the Red Deer Chiefs and was awarded the Brian Benning Trophy as the league's top defenceman in 1995. He went on to play major junior with the Regina Pats of the Western Hockey League (WHL). After his rookie WHL season, in which he scored 52 points in 67 games, Morris was drafted 13th overall by the Calgary Flames in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft, a somewhat surprising pick as Morris had been projected to be a third- or fourth-round pick. He returned to play a second season with the Pats, improving to 18 goals and 75 points before turning pro.\nFollowing Morris's 1996–97 WHL season with the Pats, he was assigned to the Calgary's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Saint John Flames for the final seven games of the regular season, as well as five post-season games. In 1997–98, he scored 9 goals and 29 points in his NHL rookie season with the Flames, earning NHL All-Rookie Team honours. He continued to improve to 34, then 38 points in his second and third seasons with the Flames before an injury-shortened season in 2000–01 kept him to 28 points in 51 games.\nIn 2001–02, Morris was again sidelined after sustaining a left wrist injury. During the season, he was unintentionally involved in a tragic incident in a game against the Columbus Blue Jackets on March 16, 2002, when an Espen Knutsen slap shot deflected off him and into the stands, striking 13-year-old Brittanie Cecil in the temple. She died from the impact two days later, prompting the NHL to implement protective netting at the ends of the rinks at the start of the following season. Morris completed the season with 34 points in 61 games.\nAfter five seasons with Calgary, reaching the 30-point mark four times, Morris was traded to the Colorado Avalanche. He made an immediate impact with the Avalanche in his first season, tallying a career-high 11 goals, 37 assists and 48 points in 2002–03.\nThe following season, Morris was traded for the second time in as many campaigns, this time to the Phoenix Coyotes. He completed the 2003–04 season playing in 14 games and recording 2 assists with the Coyotes after being traded. He finished with a combined 32 points. In his first full season with the Coyotes in 2005–06, Morris tallied 28 points in 53 games, then recorded back-to-back 25-point seasons the following two campaigns.\nOn March 4, 2009, Morris was again dealt at the trade deadline, this time to the New York Rangers. He did not re-sign with the Rangers in the off-season, instead signing a one-year contract with the Boston Bruins worth $3.3 million on July 24, 2009.\nOn March 3, 2010, Morris was traded back to the Coyotes for a conditional fourth-round pick in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft. After the season, Morris signed a four-year, $11 million contract extension with the Coyotes. With Phoenix, Morris went deep into the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs. His highlight of the playoffs was a shot from centre ice in Game 1 of the Conference finals that beat Los Angeles Kings netminder Jonathan Quick. However, the Coyotes lost the series in five games.\nThough he never officially announced his retirement, Morris has not been active since the 2013–14 season.\nInternational play.\nMorris has represented Canada on three occasions at the World Championships. After appearances in 1999 and 2001, he won his first gold medal with Canada at the 2004 World Championships in the Czech Republic. He contributed five assists in the gold-medal effort.\nPersonal life.\nMorris has three sons: Traiten, Presley and Asher. He coached for his son Presley's team, The Jr. Coyotes 02 AA, and also for eldest son Traiten's team, The Jr. Coyotes 00 AA. Morris settled in north Scottsdale, Arizona. In the summers, he and his family return to Alberta.\nMorris is currently an assistant high school coach with Chaparral High."

He played in the Strathroy &amp; District Minor Hockey Association and moved onto the Elgin-Middlesex Chiefs AAA team.\nAndy played Junior B hockey for the Strathroy Rockets. In 1994–1995, he was named the Rockets Most Valuable Player and had the best plus-minus as a forward. From the OHA he received Eastern Division MVP, League MVP, and the OHA Player of the Year. In 1995–1996, he again had the best plus-minus as a forward, was Rocket Player of the Year, MVP, and Playoff MVP. He also received the Eastern Division MVP, League MVP, and League Player of the Year that season. In the playoffs Andy scored the game-winning goal in overtime of game six against the Aylmer Aces that gave the Rockets a huge upset win and their first playoff series win in 19 years.\nAfter being spotted playing in the Western Ontario Junior Hockey League by Stan Moore and Chris Wells, Andy spent four years with a full scholarship at Colgate University alongside fellow Strathroy native Darryl Campbell, the older brother of NHL defenseman Brian Campbell. He led the Division I Red Raiders, culminating his career there with an ECAC scoring championship, being named the ECAC Player of the Year, being selected for the ECAC All-Star Team and was a finalist for the coveted Hobey Baker Award and an All-American.

        "text": "Anthony Stewart (born January 5, 1985) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player, having played in the NHL, AHL, and KHL. He was born in Quebec, and his family moved to Toronto while he was a child. Stewart played minor hockey in Toronto, winning three all-Ontario championships. After his minor hockey career, he was selected by the Kingston Frontenacs in the first round of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) draft. After two seasons with Kingston, he was drafted by the Florida Panthers in the first round of the 2003 NHL Entry Draft, at 25th overall. He spent four years in the Panthers' system, dividing his time between the NHL and the American Hockey League (AHL), after which he joined the Atlanta Thrashers for two years. When the Thrashers moved to Winnipeg to become the new Winnipeg Jets, they did not offer him a new contract, and he signed with the Carolina Hurricanes as a free agent. After one season in Carolina he was traded to the Kings, but spent most of the season in the minor leagues. He signed a professional tryout contract with the San Jose Sharks to begin the 2013–14 NHL season, but was not offered a contract. He subsequently signed with Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg in the KHL. His younger brother Chris also played in the NHL, and retired after the 2019–2020 season playing for Philadelphia Flyers.\nStewart has represented Canada internationally in two World Junior Championships, in the 2003 IIHF World U18 Championships, and twice in the ADT Canada-Russia Challenge. He was the leading goal scorer for Team Canada when they won the World U18 Championships. In the 2004 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, in which Canada won a silver medal, Stewart tied for the tournament points lead. In the 2005 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, he helped Team Canada win a gold medal. Representing the OHL at the Canada-Russia Challenge, Stewart helped his team go unbeaten in both tournaments (4–0), helping Canada to win the Challenge two years running.\nEarly life.\nStewart was born in LaSalle, Quebec, in 1985, the oldest of seven children of Norman and Sue Stewart. Norman immigrated to Canada from Jamaica in 1974, taking mainly seasonal jobs such as landscaping or construction, and Sue was a stay-at-home mother. The family moved to Toronto the year after Stewart's birth. During his childhood they were evicted from their home and moved to a subsidized shelter in what has been described as a \"rough\" neighbourhood of Scarborough. Stewart began skating at the age of four and playing hockey at five. As a young hockey player, he would often walk with his father to hockey games and practices. On one such occasion, the two were walking in a blizzard when they were picked up by a fellow hockey parent, Bob Ziemendorf, who was driving his child to the same place. Ziemendorf drove them home again after the practice, and from then on he regularly gave the family lifts and helped them with the cost of hockey and groceries. During a particularly trying time for the family, Stewart moved in with Ziemendorf and his family for over a year and a half. Stewart later stated that he believed that, without this help, he could not have got into the NHL.\nPlaying career.\nMinor hockey and major junior.\nStewart played minor hockey for the North York Canadians. He played so well that the cost of his hockey was subsidized personally by the head of the organization. With Stewart on the team, the North York Canadians won three all-Ontario championships. He played in the 1999 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with North York. After finishing his minor hockey career, Stewart was selected by the Kingston Frontenacs in the first round of the OHL draft. In his first season in the OHL, he scored 19 goals and 43 points, and in the 2002–03 season he increased his tally to 38 goals and 70 points, then added seven more points in five playoff games. In the off-season, Stewart was named captain of the Frontenacs and was drafted in the first round of the NHL draft. Going into the 2003 NHL entry draft, he was rated as the 19th best prospect among North American skaters. With their second first round draft pick, the 25th overall, the Florida Panthers selected him. While the Frontenacs missed the playoffs the following season, Stewart scored a career high 35 goals. He attended the Panthers' training camp prior to the start of the 2004–05 OHL season. He performed impressively there but was sent back to Kingston to help his growth as a player. In his last OHL season, he led the Frontenacs' scoring with 67 points. After the Frontenacs failed to make the playoffs for the second consecutive year, Stewart made his professional debut, playing 10 games for the AHL team San Antonio Rampage, during which he scored a goal and two assists.\nProfessional.\nStewart began the 2005–06 season in the AHL with the Rochester Americans. After four games he was called up by the Panthers, making his NHL debut on October 18, 2005, against New Jersey. During the game, he recorded his first NHL career point, an assist. Two days later he recorded the first NHL goal of his career, against Washington Capitals' goaltender Olaf Kolzig. He played ten games, scoring two goals and three points, before injuring his wrist when he crashed into the boards after a check by Carolina Hurricanes' defenceman Mike Commodore. The injury required surgery and ended Stewart's season. The following year was spent mainly in the AHL, playing in 62 games and registering 13 goals and 27 points. Stewart appeared in ten games with the Panthers, registering just one assist. In the 2007–08 season he spent more time in the NHL, playing in 26 games for Florida and again only registering one assist. While in the AHL, he played against his brother Chris, then a member of the Lake Erie Monsters. It was the first time they had faced each other in an organized hockey game. Anthony scored a goal and an assist in the game, and Rochester defeated Lake Erie 3–2. He finished the season with 31 points from 54 games. In the 2008–09 NHL season, for the first time in his career, Stewart played no games in the minor leagues. He played in 59 games for the Panthers, scoring 2 goals and 7 points.\nIn the off-season Stewart left the Panthers as a free agent and signed with the Atlanta Thrashers. After the 2009 pre-season he was assigned to the Thrashers' AHL affiliate, the Chicago Wolves. In his first year with them, he achieved AHL career highs in games played (77) and assists (19), and equalled his career high in points (31). Stewart played the entire 2010–11 season with the Thrashers, scoring his first career hat-trick in a game against the Anaheim Ducks. His third goal tied the game 4–4, and the Thrashers went on to win the game in a shootout. In that season Stewart set both NHL career highs and professional career highs in games played and in every major offensive statistical category.\nWhen the Thrashers moved to Winnipeg, the Winnipeg Jets opted not to submit a qualifying offer for Stewart, making him an unrestricted free agent. He signed a two-year, US$1.8 million contract with the Carolina Hurricanes on July 2, 2011. After the first 50 games with the Hurricanes Stewart recorded 6 goals and 13 points, while playing mostly on the fourth line. Despite leading the team with a +4 rating Carolina placed him on waivers. He cleared waivers the following day and remained with the team. He finished the year with 9 goals and 20 points in 77 games, while his plus-minus rating fell to -2.\nPrior to the start of the 2012–13 season the NHL enforced a lockout. Three weeks into the labor dispute Stewart signed with the Nottingham Panthers of the Elite Ice Hockey League in the United Kingdom. Stewart stated that he signed with the team as a way of staying in game shape. He played 19 games for Nottingham recording 11 points. Upon the conclusion of the lockout Carolina traded Stewart to the Los Angeles Kings, along with two draft picks in exchange for Kevin Westgarth. Los Angeles did not play Stewart in their opening game and placed him on waivers prior to their next game. Stewart cleared waivers and was assigned to the Kings minor league affiliate the Manchester Monarchs. The move allowed the Kings to activate Anze Kopitar off of their non-roster list.\nIn the 2013–14 season, Stewart initially signed a one-year contract with Russian club, Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg of the KHL. In failing to establish himself within Avtomobilist, scoring just 1 goals in 19 games, Stewart was mutually released from his contract to join Swiss club, HC Fribourg-Gottéron of the National League A, on a monthly basis contract on December 16, 2013. Stewart contributed with 8 points in 12 games, before he continued his unsettled season, joining his third club and NLA strugglers, Rapperswil-Jona Lakers in a brief stint to end the year.\nOn August 4, 2014, Stewart returned for another attempt in the KHL, signing a trial contract as a free agent with Croatian club, KHL Medveščak Zagreb. He was released from his try-out after 12 games with the club on October 14, 2014.\nInternational play.\nStewart first played internationally at the 2002 World U-17 Hockey Challenge representing Ontario. The tournament is a non-International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) sanctioned event in which Canada is represented by five teams (Pacific, Western, Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic). In the tournament Team Ontario won a bronze medal, defeating team Quebec 5–2 in the medal round. During 2002 he also made his first appearance for Team Canada playing in the non-IIHF sanctioned Eight Nations Cup, helping the team win a gold medal.\nStewart made his IIHF international debut playing for Canada in the 2003 IIHF World U18 Championships in Yaroslavl, Russia. During the tournament he scored six goals, tying for fourth place in tournament scoring. His scoring success ranked him as the top goal-scoring Canadian; however, he contributed no assists, and finished third on the team in points. The Canadian team finished the preliminary round with a 2–2–1 record. In the elimination round they defeated the Slovakian team 3–0 to win the gold medal. At the end of the tournament Stewart was named to the All-Star\nteam. Later that year Stewart represented the OHL in the 2003 ADT Canada-Russia Challenge. He scored one goal, helping the OHL win both their games, which contributed to a 5–1 series win for the Canadian Hockey League (CHL).\nThe following year Stewart was selected to play for Canada in the 2004 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Helsinki and Hämeenlinna, Finland. Canada went unbeaten in the preliminary round and advanced to the final of the elimination round, where they faced the United States team. During the second period of the final, Stewart scored a goal to put Canada ahead 3–1. It was his third point of the game, as he had made assists in the two previous goals. However, Canada conceded three goals in the third period, losing 4–3 and receiving the silver medal. Stewart finished the tournament with 11 points, tying teammate Nigel Dawes and US player Zach Parise for the tournament lead in points scored. Having scored one more goal than Stewart and Parise, Dawes was officially named the tournament's leading scorer. Later in the year Stewart was selected to play in the 2004 ADT Canada-Russia Challenge as part of the OHL All-Stars team, and later he was named an alternate captain. He scored a short handed goal in the OHL's second game of the series, a 5–2 win. The OHL won both of its games in the series, helping the CHL to a 4–2 win in the series.\nIn 2005 Stewart was again selected to play for Canada in the World Junior Championships in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Unlike in previous years, Stewart struggled at this tournament, and in the second game he was relegated to 13th forward. An injury to teammate Jeremy Colliton allowed Stewart to play in the following game, in which he scored two goals, contributing to a 9–0 defeat of the German team. Once more, Canada had an undefeated run to the final, where they faced Russia. In the final Stewart scored the fifth goal in a 6–1 win for Canada, earning him his third international gold medal.\nMedia.\nFrom 2018-2023, Stewart was employed as an on-air analyst by Sportsnet in Canada."

In a 1996 game, he threw a no-hitter with 16 strikeouts and hit a home run. After graduation, he attended Saint Peter's College, New Jersey for three years. At the end of his junior season, the Philadelphia Phillies selected him with the 396th overall pick of the 1999 June draft, as part of that draft's thirteenth round. He signed with the Phillies and began his professional career with the Batavia Muckdogs, where he was honored as a member of the New York–Penn League's All-Star team.\nBrooks began his professional career as a starting pitcher, but he converted to relief partway through the season. He was dominant in Double-A in , striking out 71 batters in 58 innings, while surrendering only 40 hits and five home runs. Brooks's performance caught the eye of the Pittsburgh Pirates, who acquired him in a deadline deal for closer Mike Williams. After the trade, Brooks spent time with two of the Pirates' affiliates, the Altoona Curve and the Nashville Sounds.\nThe New York Mets selected Brooks in the Rule 5 draft that off-season, and then immediately traded him to the Oakland Athletics. Brooks was one of five players chosen from the Pirates in the major league portion of that Rule 5 draft, a series of events that resulted in a great deal of criticism of Pirates' general manager, Dave Littlefield. Brooks failed to stick with the Athletics, but when placed on waivers on March 18, was claimed by the Boston Red Sox. Boston likewise had trouble finding space for him on their roster, and when placed on waivers again on March 31, cleared them and was sent back to the Pirates.\nAfter spending most of at Triple-A, Brooks made his major league debut on August 27, 2004, and went on to appear in eleven games with the Pirates. He pitched well in relief, striking out 17 batters in 16 innings and surrendering only a .175 batting average to opposing hitters, but his final season totals were distorted by a poor performance in an emergency start. The Pirates placed him on waivers to clear roster space at the end of the season, and he was claimed by the Los Angeles Dodgers. Brooks went through spring training with the Dodgers, but was placed on waivers yet again on April 13, 2005, and was claimed by the Atlanta Braves.\nBrooks spent the majority of the 2005 season with the Braves' Triple-A affiliate, the Richmond Braves. He did earn a brief callup to Atlanta, pitching to two batters in a game against the San Diego Padres on May 16. At the end of the year, Brooks signed with the New York Yankees as a minor league free agent. In April , Brooks signed a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals. He was released on June 12 and five days later signed with the Boston Red Sox. Brooks spent the rest of 2006 pitching for the Red Sox Double-A affiliate, the Portland Sea Dogs. On November 8, 2006, Brooks signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres and became a free agent after the season.\nOn April 14, , Brooks signed with the Somerset Patriots of the Atlantic League."

He served as the head football coach at the University of Wyoming (1977–1979), East Carolina University (1989–1991), and the Georgia Institute of Technology (1992–1994), compiling a career college football record of 45–52–2. Lewis was a defensive assistant at many schools and most notably served as an assistant to Vince Dooley at the University of Georgia, helping win a National Championship in 1980.\nCoaching career.\nWyoming.\nLewis was named the University of Wyoming's 22nd head football coach in December 1976 following the hiring of Fred Akers by the University of Texas at Austin to be the Longhorn's head coach. \nLewis compiled a 13–21–1 (.386) win–loss record as Wyoming's coach through the 1977 to 1979 seasons. He was fired at the conclusion of the '79 season and replaced by Pat Dye. His largest margin of victory was 51–21 over the University of Texas at El Paso during the 1978 season. His worst loss as the Cowboys head coach came against LSU the year before, 1977. The LSU Tigers pounced on Wyoming, 66–7, in Baton Rouge. \nDuring his tenure at Wyoming, Lewis produced two noted NFL prospects, Ken Fantetti, a linebacker who went on to play for the Detroit Lions for seven years (1979–1985) and Guy Frazier another linebacker who played six years in the NFL for the Cincinnati Bengals (1981–1984) and the Buffalo Bills (1985–1986).\nEast Carolina.\nIn his most successful head coaching position, Lewis led the East Carolina Pirates to an 11–1 record and an amazing come from behind Peach Bowl victory over North Carolina State in 1991.

The 1991 Pirates finished the season with their highest national ranking, #9 in both the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll, and Lewis received 1991 National Coach-of-the-Year honors from the American Football Coaches Association, United Press International, and Scripps-Howard.\nGeorgia Tech.\nLewis assumed the head coaching position at Georgia Tech in 1991 following Bobby Ross's departure to coach the NFL's San Diego Chargers. Lewis held the position from 1992 until midway through the 1994 season; he resigned (though some reports say he was effectively fired) after a 1–7 start and was replaced by defensive coordinator George O'Leary, who coached the final three games of the season, all losses.\nNotre Dame.\nFrom 2005 to 2007, Lewis served as the assistant head coach and defensive backs coach for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish under Charlie Weis."

        "text": "The Mid-American Conference men's basketball tournament is an NCAA Division I postseason single-elimination tournament. The winner of the tournament receives the Mid-American Conference (MAC) automatic bid to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship. As of 2021, the top eight teams in conference play qualify for the tournament. Since 2000, the MAC Tournament has been held at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Cleveland and is planned to be held there through at least 2030. The finals are broadcast on ESPN2 while the semifinals on CBS Sports Network &amp; the quarterfinals are on ESPN+ for streaming.\nThe tournament was first played in 1980 and expanded to include all conference members in 2000. The tournament continued to involve all conference members (barring postseason bans due to NCAA sanctions) through the 2020 edition, which was canceled in progress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2020, as part of a broader suite of changes to MAC postseason tournaments triggered by the pandemic, the MAC announced it would reduce its men's and women's basketball tournaments to 8 teams, with all qualifying teams playing in Cleveland. Additionally, the MAC eliminated its basketball divisions and increased its conference schedule from 18 to 20 games. These changes will remain in place through at least the 2023–24 season. Ball State, Kent State, and Ohio have the most tournament championships with seven.\nFormat.\nSeeding for the tournament is determined by winning percentage in conference play; during the era of MAC divisional play, divisional alignment did not figure into tournament seeding. The following tiebreakers are used:\n1. Between \"two\" teams:\nA. Head-to-head competition; B. Division Record (only used if the two teams in question are tied for the Division lead); C. Winning percentage vs. ranked conference teams (top to bottom, regardless of division, vs. common opponents regardless of the number of times played); D. Coin flip\n2. For \"multiple\" (3 or more) team ties:\nA. Total won-lost record/winning percentage of games played among the tied teams; B. Two (2)-team tie-breaker procedure goes into effect\nHistorical formats.\nFrom 2016 through the abbreviated 2020 edition, all 12 conference members participated in the tournament. The top four seeds received byes into the quarterfinals; seeds 5-12 played first-round games at the campus of the higher seed. Winners of the first-round games advanced to face the top four seeds in the quarterfinal round in Cleveland.\nFrom 2012 through 2015, the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds received byes straight to the semifinals, with the No. 3 and No. 4 seeds beginning tournament play in the quarterfinals. Teams seeded 5–12 played an additional two rounds. First round games were played at the home sites of the higher seeds, with the remaining rounds being contested at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, then known as Quicken Loans Arena. Under this format, a team seeded fifth or lower had to win four games in six days, while playing five games in eight days, to win the conference tournament. The division winners were guaranteed to receive a seed not lower than four.\nFrom 2002 through 2011, the format for the conference tournament was similar to the 2016 through 2020 format. Each conference member received a berth in the tournament, with the top four seeds receiving byes into the quarterfinals. Unlike the current format, division winners were guaranteed at least the No. 2 seed. First round games for seeds 5–12 were played at the home sites of the higher seeds, with the remaining rounds being contested at Quicken Loans Arena.\nFrom 1980 through 1988, seven teams qualified for the three-round tournament. The No. 1 seed received a bye into the semifinals. In 1989, an eighth team was added and each of the teams participated in all three rounds. The tournament was expanded in 2000 to four rounds and included all 13 conference teams. The top three teams received byes into the quarterfinals.\nPerformance by school.\n\"* No longer member of MAC\""

        "title": "Hoppers Crossing Cricket Club",
        "text": "The Hoppers Crossing Cricket Club is a cricket club located in Victoria, Australia. \nHistory.\nThe club was formed in 1977 as the Hoppers Crossing Footballers Cricket Club after it received its initial financial backing from the Hoppers Crossing Football Club (HCFC). Shortly into its first season, sufficient funds were raised to recompense the Football Club and it was renamed the Hoppers Crossing Cricket Club (HCCC).\nThe first team was entered into the \"B-turf\" section of the Sunshine Cricket Association in season 1977/78. The club were runners-up in the first season. After this, the club grew quickly to a level where four open age teams were taking the field. Junior cricket was introduced and teams were entered into a local Under-14 competition in the Wyndham area. Following the initial set up, HCCC took over the running of this competition, which comprised six teams. The club benefited greatly from this structure, as evidenced by the three Under-14 premierships in a row, on entry into the SCA's Under-14 competition. At the commencement of the 1983/84 season, it transferred into the Williamstown and District Cricket Association (WDCA). This was in conjunction with the club's move from its prior residence, in Heaths Road, to its current Hogans Road address. Shortly after this move, a turf wicket was installed on the number one oval with the assistance of the then Werribee Council. The 1986/87 season saw the appointment of the club's first ever coach, Greg Evans. In his first year at the helm, Greg took the club to the runners-up position. At the commencement of the 1989/90 season, the club took its next evolutionary step by entering its first and second elevens into the Victorian Junior Cricket Association (now the Victorian Turf Cricket Association (VTCA)). During this season under the coaching of Mark Mitchell, it won its first ever First Eleven premiership, in the North Central Division. It then gained promotion into North A through to Senior A. In 2015, the club was entered into the Victorian Sub-District Cricket Association (VSDCA). In that first season, (2015/16) the First and Third Elevens lost in the first week of finals. The Firsts to the eventual runners-up, Caulfield, and the Thirds to the season winners Yarraville. At the beginning of the 2020/21 season, the club completed their fifth ever VSDCA round sweep and first one ever in the opening round. All four sides defeated Melton with the firsts and thirds at MacPherson Park and the seconds and fourths won at home.\nHCCC Alumni.\nSince the commencement of the club, it has produced nine First Eleven District Players with five at Footscray (Mark Mitchell, Jamie Rubeli, Grant Burns, Paul Murray and Nathan Caulfield), two at North Melbourne (Trent Said, Ian Timms), one at University (Greg Kennedy) and one at Richmond (Brodie Andrew). Two of these players have represented Victoria at state level (Mark Mitchell in the Under 19s and Paul Murray in the Under 21s). The club has had numerous junior cricketers represented in the various representative sides available within Victoria.\nEnglishman Stuart Broad played for the team in the summer of 2004-05, and went on to play first-class cricket for Leicestershire, the England U-19 team in 2005 and England A in 2006. Broad played his first One Day International for England against Pakistan in 2006 and made his Test debut against Sri Lanka in 2007. He has recently succeeded in Test cricket by taking his 500th Test match wicket in the 2020 Test series between England and West Indies.\nEnglishman Matthew Boyce, who also represented Leicestershire recently against Pakistan played for the club in its 2003-04 season.\nHoppers Crossing is also the home club of Fawad Ahmed. Fawad played brilliantly during his time at the Cats including taking two 8 wicket hauls. He made his international debut in a T20 against England on the 29th of August, 2013. He then made his ODI debut in a match against Scotland five days later. Ahmed has also had massive success playing with Victoria in the Australian domestic one-day cup and the 4-day Sheffield Shield competition. The leg-spinner won three Shield titles in a row from 2014/15 to 2016/17.\nCurrent Teams.\nCurrently the club fields 4 senior turf sides in the VSDCA, 2 synthetic sides in the WSCCCA plus a side in the Victorian Veterans competition. They also field a senior women's side and under 16 junior girls side in conjunction with Sanctuary Lakes Cricket Club, 9 junior sides in the Western Region Junior Cricket Association and an under 13 girls team in the same competition."

Although rumored to be the destination where Moss would end up, Dallas opted to take a player in Ellis who did not possess the character issues that Moss did.\nHe became a starter at defensive end for Dallas immediately and started 155 of 162 games during his Cowboy career from 1998-2008. For the first eight years he spent a similar amount of time as the starting right end as he did the starting left end.

Other top sack seasons were 2004 (9.0), 2003 and 2005 (8.0 each) and 1999 and 2002 (7.5 each). In 2007 Ellis was selected for the NFC Pro Bowl roster and was named the NFL Comeback Player of the Year, acknowledging his return from a season-ending Achilles tendon suffered during the 2006 campaign.\nThe Cowboys decided to release Ellis on June 2, 2009, saving $4.15 million in cap space.\nOakland Raiders.\nEllis agreed on a 3-year contract for $10 million with the Oakland Raiders on June 15, 2009. In Oakland, Ellis returned to the position of defensive end in a 4-3 scheme. Ellis joined a Raiders line that would also include former Patriot and all-pro Richard Seymour.\nEllis started all 14 games he appeared in for the Raiders in 2009 at right defensive end. He amassed seven quarterback sacks, 26 tackles, two forced fumbles and two fumble recoveries. He was released on March 8, 2010.\nCoaching career.\nIn 2020, Ellis returned to football to become the head football coach at Texas College, a historically black college (HBCU) and National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) members, located in Tyler, Texas.

        "text": "The Premier Volleyball League (PVL) is the top-level women's professional volleyball league in the Philippines organized by Sports Vision Management Group, Inc. The league began in 2004 as the Shakey's V-League (SVL), a women's collegiate league. In 2017 the league was renamed into Premier Volleyball League. From 2011 to 2020, the league was open to participation of corporate clubs and other non-collegiate teams. The league status turned professional in 2021.\nThe Spikers' Turf is the men's counterpart of the league.\nHistory.\n2004–2016: Shakey's V-League.\nThe Premier Volleyball League was established in 2004 as the Shakey's V-League by Sports Vision Management Group, Inc. led by Jun Bernardino, Ricky Palou, Moying Martelino and Rhea Navarro. The Shakey's V-League was initially an inter-collegiate women's league with participants from the UAAP, NCAA, and CESAFI among others. The SVL's establishment was in cooperation with Shakey's Pizza (Philippines) serving as its title sponsor until 2016. Prior to the league's establishment, the sport was in a state of stagnation since the 1990s with the highest level of competitive volleyball being the women's collegiate tournament of the Metro Manila-based UAAP.\nAmong the unique rules implemented by Shakey's V-League upon its founding was allowing the collegiate (and later, corporate managed) teams to have maximum of two reinforcements - termed as \"guest players\" - on their roster. These guest players have ranged from alumni of the participating schools, high school recruits who use the ongoing tournament as preparation for the upcoming collegiate season and foreigners (with the most notable being the Thai Jaroensri Bualee). In a few cases, participating schools had guest players who were alumni of another collegiate program to increase the competitive field.\nPrior to 2011, guest players for colleges were eligible in the two (or in a few instances, three) tournaments held during the year - they were henceforth limited to the Open or Reinforced conferences until such format was succeeded by the one foreign reinforcement per team in 2016 (as \"imports\").\nThe UST Golden Tigresses won the inaugural V-League championship in 2004 defeating the DLSU Lady Archers. But DLSU won the next three conferences, defeating UST in both tourneys of Season 2 and the SSC-R Lady Stags in Season 3, sweeping both in the Finals of the three conferences.\nThe UST Tigresses returned to the league in 2007, after missing Season 3, winning both conferences (tournaments) of Season 4 by defeating the SSC-R Lady Stags in both finals series.\nYear 2008 saw the crowning of two other schools aside from UST and DLSU. Adamson University won the championship in Season 5's First Conference defeating the Ateneo Lady Eagles while San Sebastian College-Recoletos Lady Stags won the succeeding Second Conference by sweeping the two comebacking champion teams: DLSU Lady Archers in the semifinals and UST Tigresses in the finals.\nHowever, the Tigresses made history via a \"three-peat\" winning their fourth, fifth and sixth championships by sweeping both tourneys of Season 6 by defeating SSC-R and Adamson, respectively in both championship series, and again winning the first conference of Season 7 by beating SSC-R for the fourth time in the finals. It was the battle for silver of the prior two conferences when Adamson University faced the Lady Stags of SSC-R in the finals of the 2nd Conference Season 7. Adamson won its second V-League crown after defeating San Sebastian 2–1 in their Finals series.\nThe Ateneo Lady Eagles won their first Shakey's V-League crown by thumping defending champions Adamson in the Finals of Season 8's First Conference. The 2nd Conference for the year was renamed as the Shakey's V-League Open Conference as it was opened to semi-commercial teams with the addition of the Philippine Army, Philippine Navy, Philippine Air Force and Maynilad. The Philippine Army won their first Shakey's V-League championship. Season 8-Open Conference, Shakey's V-League will also aired on GMA Life TV, GMA News TV and GMA Pinoy TV for the international viewers.\nThe Shakey's V-League formallu welcomed the participation of corporate and non-collegiate teams starting 2011.\nSeason 9 was locally aired by the AKTV bloc on IBC13 and the Hyper channel.\nBeginning its 10th Season, Shakey's V-League's new broadcasting partner was GMA News TV. Matches were aired at 1PM to 3PM during weekdays, and 12:45PM to 2:30PM during Saturdays. On May 26, 2013, Shakey's V-League held its first live TV coverage via GMA News TV. It is also announced that the Game 3 matches, both for Championship and the Battle for 3rd will be aired live on GMA News TV on June 2, 2013. In Season 10 Open Conference, Cagayan Valley made history as the Lady Rising Suns scored a tournament sweep, winning all matches from the elimination to the Finals en route to the team's first V-League title with a 2–0 series win over Smart-Maynilad Net Spikers.\nOn October 2, 2014, it was reported that a men's division will be included in its 21st conference with four teams.\nOn May 24, 2016, it was officially announced that Shakey's V-League will be aired on S+A Channel 23 following an agreement between Sports Vision, Shakey's and ABS-CBN Sports.\n2017–2020: Premier Volleyball League, professional status and hiatus.\nThe Shakey's V-League changed its name to the Premier Volleyball League (PVL) starting the 2017 season. The Spikers' Turf, which was spun-off from the league in 2015, was merged back to the PVL and was rebranded as the PVL's men's division. The renaming was part of a bid to secure more sponsorship for the league. There was a plan to rename the league to the Philippine Volleyball League instead but this was abandoned due to another entity already owning the name. The order of its conference was also changed with the league beginning with the import-laden Reinforced Conference and the Open Conference being held close to the start of the UAAP and NCAA tournaments which is usually held near the year's end. Prior to this, the Open Conference was traditionally held earlier. \nThe PVL men's division ended with the 2018 PVL Collegiate Conference as its final tournament. The men's division reverted to the Spikers' Turf. The first tournament since the revert was the Open Conference in October 2018.\nThe 2020 season was indefinitely postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and there were plans to start the season with the Open Conference instead of the Reinforced Conference in September 2020 due to logistics issue of flying in imports for the latter.\nIn October 2020, the Philippines' Games and Amusements Board (GAB) issued a directive that players compensated for non-national team play would be considered as professionals, as well as all sporting events organized for profit. This has raised concerns regarding the status of leagues such as the PVL and its rival league, the Philippine Super Liga (PSL). The PVL in particular was concerned over the financial aspects of operating as a professional league.\nIn November 2020, the PVL announced that the league would turn professional starting with the 2021 season, believing it has enough women players to make the move. The league was already considering move for some time due to the collegiate league UAAP deciding to bar its rookies from playing in commercial leagues starting its UAAP Season 81 (2018-19) in anticipation that all college players would not be allowed to play in the PVL eventually. Prior to the league's professionalization, the PVL was considered as semi-professional and thus, its affairs were not supervised or regulated by the GAB. Six PVL teams—BaliPure, Banko Perlas, Choco Mucho, Creamline, Motolite, and Petro Gazz—agreed to the move of the PVL turning professional.\nA new separate league called the V-League, was formed to accommodate collegiate and amateur teams which could no longer participate in the PVL due to the league's professionalization. Prior to its professionalization, the PVL hosted a collegiate conference.\n2021–present: Return of the league and further expansion.\nPrior to the start of the 2021 season, five PSL teams—Chery Tiggo, Cignal HD, F2 Logistics, PLDT, and Sta. Lucia—joined the PVL, which rendered the PVL a \"unified\" professional league, leaving the PSL with only three inactive member teams.\nThe PVL returned in 2021 with the 2021 Open Conference, which was staged in a bubble set-up. The recurrence of an entire season began the following year. In October 2022, PVL announced the use of video challenge system for the first time in the return of the Reinforced Conference after three years.\nThe 2023 season saw the rebranding of the Open Conference as the All-Filipino Conference to better reflect that only Filipino players could compete in said conference. After the All-Filipino Conference, the league saw the addition of two new teams in Farm Fresh Foxies and Quezon City Gerflor Defenders, and the reappearance of Foton Tornadoes in the Filipino volleyball scene. The three teams pledged to participate in the league for at least the next three years. With the inclusion of three new teams comes with the skipping of Philippine Army Lady Troopers from joining the league due to military training to most of its players. Foton withdrew shortly after their participation in Invitational Conference because some of its players didn't get a contract renewal and they returned to the franchise's main team, the Chery Tiggo. F2 Logistics and Gerflor Defenders were disbanded after the 2023 season.\nStarting the 2024 season, two new established teams will join the All-Filipino Conference namely Strong Group Athletics, who took over the Gerflor Defenders franchise, and Capital1 Solar Spikers. PVL announced \nthat the two conferences—Invitational and Reinforced—merged into one conference to align with the FIVB calendar.\nAwardees.\nBelow is the table for the most awarded players in the league's history (2017–present):\nNotable records.\nBelow is the table for the notable records of the league during its history (2017–present):\nPlaying venues.\nThe Premier Volleyball League (as well as its predecessor) does not use a \"home-and-away\" format since most teams are managed by corporations. Games are presently held at the Filoil EcoOil Centre in San Juan, PhilSports Arena in Pasig, Smart Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City, and SM Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay. Aside from the regular venues, the PVL are holding games outside of Metro Manila, known as the \"PVL on Tour\" since its first season.\nDuring the 2021 season, the league held its first season as a professional league at PCV Socio-Civic &amp; Cultural Center in Bacarra, Ilocos Norte. This was held in an isolation zone (bubble) setup due to the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. And in the 2022 Open, the preliminary round games were held in Paco Arena in Manila in the same bubble format as the last conference. Starting from the playoffs of the said conference, the league officially started reaccepting live audiences to watch the games.\nMedia coverage.\nSimilar to the current structure being done by the Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League, the PVL's predecessor Shakey's V-League utilized an in-house broadcast panel until 2016 to cover the games. Current PBA radio anchor and coliseum barker Noel Zarate and Sev Sarmenta originally served as the longtime play-by-play for the volleyball games with Mozzy Ravena, Noreen Go and Ivy Remulla, among others providing color commentary. Miriam College alumna and volleyball coach Maria Aurora \"Mac\" Gepuela serves as the SVL's main in-venue public address announcer. Upon ABS-CBN Sports' gaining of the league's broadcast rights in 2016, Anton Roxas, Boom Gonzales and the network's in-house personnel replaced Zarate and Sarmenta. Gepuela remained as the public address announcer\nIBC-13 served as the inaugural partner from 2004-2005 before moving to the Associated Broadcasting Company (ABC) from.2005-06. NBN/PTV–4 took over from 2007–2011 before transferring to the AKTV bloc on IBC-13 from 2012–2013 with a concurrent satellite TV coverage through Cignal TV's Hyper. GMA News TV (2013–2015) served as the last partner of Sports Vision's in house broadcast panel before ABS-CBN Sports took over in 2016 through Channel 23. In the aftermath of the ABS-CBN legislative franchise renewal controversy, the PVL moved to One Sports from the 2021 season onwards with former ABS-CBN Sports personnel continuing at the helm\nFor overseas viewers, GMA Life TV, GMA Pinoy TV and GMA News TV International carried the games before transferring to S+A International in 2016"

        "title": "Single-handed sailing",
        "text": "The sport and practice of single-handed sailing or solo sailing is sailing with only one crewmember (i.e., only one person on board the vessel). The term usually refers to ocean and long-distance sailing and is used in competitive sailing and among Cruisers.\nTerminology.\nIn sailing, a hand is a member of a ship's crew. \"Single-handed\" therefore means with a crew of one, i.e., only one person on the vessel. The term \"single-handed\" is also used more generally in English to mean \"done without help from others\" or, literally, \"with one hand\".\nIn the sailing community, the term \"crewed\" (or sometimes \"fully-crewed\") is used to mean sailing with a crew of more than one, in order to distinguish events permitting larger crews from their single-handed equivalents (even though a solo sailor is also correctly referred to as a vessel's crew). Hence, for example, \"Bruno Peyron ... has taken part in almost all the large crewed and single-handed sailing events since the 80's.\" In contrast, the term \"double-handed\" is used to refer to sailing with two persons on board.\nMany significant voyages, such as ocean passages, have been made single-handed, and many single-handed circumnavigations have been accomplished. \"Single-handed\" does not imply \"non-stop\", so a single-handed circumnavigation counts as such even with stops, as in Joshua Slocum's voyage.\nSailing alone.\nThe racing scene.\nSingle-handed sailing has become a major competitive sport, and there are a number of prominent single-handed offshore races. The Single-Handed Trans-Atlantic Race (OSTAR) and the Route du Rhum are trans-Atlantic single-handed races. The single handed transpac (SHTP) starts off Tiburon in the San Francisco Bay, and ends in Hanalei Bay, Kauai. Round-the-world yacht racing began with the single-handed Sunday Times Golden Globe Race. Two modern round-the-world races descended from this event are the Velux 5 Oceans Race (Around Alone), which is run in several stages with stops in between, and the Vendée Globe, a non-stop race around the world and perhaps the ultimate event in single-handed sailing. Many single-handed races make use of Open 50 and Open 60 boats.\nStringent rules apply to single-handed races and speed records. As with any sailing race, the voyage must be completed under sail, and the boat must be operated and powered by wind and muscle-power alone (no electric or hydraulic winches). Some races are carried out in stages, where repairs and resupply may be carried out at the intermediate ports of call; in non-stop races and record attempts, no outside assistance is permitted, whether in the form of a tow, repairs, or supplies. However, anchoring to make repairs under one's own resources is generally permitted.\nIn terms of safety, very stringent entry requirements apply to major races. The crew must meet requirements for both past experience and training, and the vessel and equipment must meet specified standards.\nOne issue that arises with single-handed round-the-world racing is that of verifying that the competitor has actually sailed around the world. In practice, faking such a voyage, along with all of the detailed logs, workings of celestial navigation sights, radio check-ins at various places, and so on, would be virtually impossible; however, in the Golden Globe Race, one competitor did actually attempt this. Today, racers in major offshore races are required to carry location beacons, such as Inmarsat-C with GPS, or the Argos System; these beacons report each boat's position continuously to race headquarters. This is primarily for safety, and to permit daily race reports; however, it also means there is a verifiable record of the competitor's route.\nRequirements.\nComplete competence with sailing and seamanship are required for single-handing, as is a high degree of self-sufficiency. Physical fitness is of particular importance for single-handing, as all of the tasks which would ordinarily be handled by two or more persons must be accomplished by the single sailor. This includes often arduous sail adjustments and sail changes in all weathers, including heavy weather (very windy or stormy weather).\nThis is true many times over for competitive sailors; for example, Ellen MacArthur's \"Kingfisher\" monohull, in which she completed the 2000 Vendée Globe, has an upwind sail area of , as compared to a conservative recreational round-the-world yacht such as a Westsail 32, which has a sail area of only , despite these two boats having virtually the same displacement (weight), at around . With all sail handling being by the muscle power of one person, this huge sail area directly translates to physical effort, and the much greater power-to-weight ratio makes handling the boat a greater physical challenge. In addition, while a recreational sailor might wait for a while before reacting to a change in conditions, a racer will respond to every wind shift with a sail adjustment or change, resulting in much more frequent exertions.\nHazards.\nFalling overboard while single-handed ocean sailing is almost certainly fatal, as there is no one to attempt to recover the crewmember who has fallen overboard. However, the nightmare scenario of floating in mid-ocean while watching one's boat sail away under auto-pilot makes many single-handers very cautious. Staying on the boat (by careful and thorough use of handholds, lifelines, and tethers) is undoubtedly the best approach for any sailor, but some single-handers tow a rope astern, as a last desperate chance if they should fall overboard. \nModern technology has given us EPIRB, PLB, SART Radar SART and AIS SART devices which can help recover victims of a man overboard (MOB) incident. Additionally the most modern autopilot systems eg NKE Gyropilot have - or can have added as a retro-fit option - remote control handsets which not only allows the autopilot to be remotely controlled from anywhere on the boat but also detects when an individual carrying/wearing one goes over board, sounding the alarm and, depending on type of installation and mode selected, either turning the boat into the wind or locking the rudder hard over on the opposite tack causing the yacht to stall/forereach, in both cases preventing the boat from continuing on its route and allowing a conscious MOB the possibility of getting back aboard. \nFalling overboard while single-handed sailing also creates a hazard to navigation for all other vessels as the now-uncontrolled vessel can remain afloat for an extended period.\nOne of the greatest challenges facing a lone sailor is managing the need to sleep, since a good watch must be kept at all times while at sea. Many single-handers use the technique of napping for 15 to 20 minutes at a time, using a timer to wake them up for periodic look-arounds; with the relatively slow speed of a sailboat, this allows most hazards to be seen in time. Again the challenge is greater for racers, given their higher speeds and more intense activity, and some racers have carried out considerable research into getting the maximum benefit from short cat-naps. Especially for racing, often routes are chosen that stay away from land, shallow areas and busy shipping routes. In the Southern Ocean sailors often do not see another boat for weeks. Recreational sailors usually choose a more tropical route (through the Panama Canal) closer to land and have to keep a better lookout for shipping. They often stop in ports en route for rest and sightseeing. In recent years the Automatic Identification System has become available to non-commercial shipping, providing advance warning of collision risks.\nNotable milestones.\nThe pioneers.\nThe recorded history of modern single-handed voyages begins with an American sailor, Josiah Shackford, who is reported to have sailed from France to Surinam, in South America, although this has not been reliably authenticated. Another unauthenticated voyage is that of Captain Cleveland of Salem, who was said to have sailed nearly around the world single-handed in a boat around 1800. A more likely account is that of J.M. Crenston, who is reported to have sailed a boat from New Bedford, Massachusetts, to San Francisco (whether by Cape Horn or the Strait of Magellan is unknown).\nSingle-handed sailing received a great impetus in the middle of the 19th century, when it was popularised by three British sailors, R.T. McMullen, John MacGregor and Frank Cowper. Although neither man made a major single-handed offshore passage, MacGregor achieved some fame for sailing a yawl from London to Paris and back in 1867. His book, \"The Voyage Alone in the Yawl Rob Roy\"; McMullen's book, \"Down Channel\", published in 1869, and Frank Cowper's classic \"Sailing Tours\" series (1892–96) inspired many people to cruise.\nThe first authenticated single-handed ocean crossing was made in 1876 by a 30-year-old fisherman named Alfred \"Centennial\" Johnson. Johnson sailed out of Gloucester, Massachusetts, to cross the Atlantic Ocean in an open dory named \"Centennial\". His voyage was timed to celebrate the United States centennial. He set off on the crossing on June 15, 1876; he averaged about a day, and contacted many vessels along the way, getting positions from their navigators. After surviving a major gale that capsized the boat, he finally made landfall at Abercastle, Wales, on August 12, 1876. Another Gloucesterman, Howard Blackburn, made single-handed Atlantic crossings in 1899 and 1901. In 1882, Bernard Gilboy sailed a schooner that he built himself from San Francisco across the Pacific in 162 days until he was picked up exhausted and starving off Queensland, Australia after a swordfish pierced his hull and he lost the rudder.\nWilliam Albert Andrews, of Beverley, Massachusetts, made several significant single-handed voyages, and instigated the first single-handed trans-Atlantic race. Andrews first crossed the Atlantic with his brother in a dory in 1878. He made an aborted attempt at a single-handed crossing in 1888, and then in 1891 he issued a challenge to any single-hander to race him across the ocean for a prize of $5,000. Josiah W. Lawlor, the son of a famous boat-builder, took up the challenge, and the two men built boats for the race. They set off from Crescent Beach near Boston on June 21, 1891. Andrews, capsized several times and was finally picked up by a steamer; but Lawlor arrived at Coverack, Cornwall, on August 5, 1891.\nThe sport of long-distance single-handed sailing was firmly established with the famous voyage of Joshua Slocum, who circumnavigated the world between 1895 and 1898. Despite widespread opinion that such a voyage was impossible (there was no Panama Canal then), Slocum, a retired sea captain, rebuilt a sloop, \"Spray\", and sailed it around the world—the first single-handed circumnavigation of the world. His book \"Sailing Alone Around the World\" is still considered a classic adventure, and it inspired many others to take to the seas.\nIn 1942, the Argentine sailor Vito Dumas set out on a single-handed circumnavigation of the Southern Ocean. He left Buenos Aires in June, sailing \"Lehg II\", a ketch. He had only the most basic and makeshift gear; he had no radio, for fear of being shot as a spy, and was forced to stuff his clothes with newspaper to keep warm. His voyage of was not a true circumnavigation, as it was contained within the southern hemisphere; however, he made the first single-handed passage of the three great capes, and indeed the first successful single-handed passage of Cape Horn. With only three landfalls, Vito Dumas described the legs of his trip as the longest that had been made by a single-hander, and in the most ferocious oceans on the Earth.\nIn 1955, the Filipino immigrant to Hawaii, Florentino Das set out on a home-built 27-footer from Kewalo Basin to his hometown of Allen, Northern Samar, Philippines. His solo sailing feat took him 12 months passing through Ponape, Truk Island, the Hall Islands, and Yap Island. He arrived in Siargao Island in northern Mindanao on April 25, 1956.\nThe beginnings of modern racing.\nOrganised single-handed yacht racing was pioneered by Britons \"Blondie\" Hasler and Francis Chichester, who conceived the idea of a single-handed race across the Atlantic Ocean. This was a revolutionary concept at the time, as the idea was thought to be extremely impractical, particularly in the adverse conditions of their proposed route—a westward crossing of the north Atlantic Ocean. Nevertheless, their original half-crown bet on first place developed into the first single-handed transatlantic yacht race, the OSTAR, which was held in 1960. The race was a success, and was won in 40 days by Chichester, then aged 58, in \"Gipsy Moth III\"; Hasler finished second, in 48 days, sailing the junk-rigged \"Jester\". Hasler's wind-vane self-steering gear revolutionised short-handed sailing, and his other major innovation—using a junk rig for safer and more manageable shorthanded sailing—influenced many subsequent sailors. Chichester placed second in the second running of the race four years later. The winner on that occasion, Eric Tabarly, sailed in the first ever boat specifically designed for single-handed ocean racing, the ketch \"Pen Duick II\".\nNot content with his achievements, Chichester set his sights on the next logical goal—a racing-style circumnavigation of the world. In 1966 he set off in \"Gipsy Moth IV\", a yacht custom-built for a speed attempt, in order to set the fastest possible time for a round-the-world trip—in effect, the first speed record for a single-handed circumnavigation. He followed the clipper route from Plymouth, United Kingdom, to Sydney, Australia, where he stopped over for 48 days, then continued south of Cape Horn back to Plymouth. In the process he became the first single-handed sailor to circumnavigate west-to-east, by the clipper route, with just one stop (of 48 days) in 274 days overall, with a sailing time of 226 days, twice as fast as the previous record for a small vessel. At the age of 65, Chichester had once again revolutionised single-handed sailing.\nThe first single-handed round-the-world yacht race—and actually the first round-the-world yacht race in any format—was the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race, starting between June 1 and October 31 (the skippers set off at different times) in 1968. Of the nine boats which started:\nThe first woman to sail from Los Angeles to Hawaii was Sharon Sites Adams, in 1965 with a 25-foot Danish folkboat. She added to this feat in 1969 by sailing a Sea Sharp II fiberglass Mariner 31 from Yokosuka, Japan to San Diego, CA in 1969. These feats have been documented and described in her book \"Pacific Lady.\"\nThe modern era.\nEven after the main \"firsts\" had been achieved—first solo circumnavigation, first non-stop—other sailors set out to make their mark on history. In 1965, at the age of just 16, Robin Lee Graham set out from southern California to sail around the world in his sailboat \"Dove\", and in 1970 he successfully completed the youngest (at age 16–21) solo circumnavigation. Following in Chichester's wake, Alec Rose, a 58-year-old British grocer, set off in 1967 to sail solo around the world. He completed his voyage on July 4, 1968, after two stops, and was knighted the following day. He subsequently wrote a book, \"My Lively Lady\", about his voyage. Despite his failure in the Golden Globe, Chay Blyth had decided that endurance sailing was for him, and in 1970–1971 he made the first westabout single-handed non-stop circumnavigation via the great capes, i.e., against the prevailing winds of the roaring forties.\nSingle-handed racing continued to develop with the creation in 1977 of the Mini-Transat, a single-handed transatlantic race for boats smaller than . The first edition started from Penzance, UK; today it runs from Douarnenez, France, to Guadeloupe.\nThe major women's firsts were achieved in just over ten years. Poland's Krystyna Chojnowska-Liskiewicz set off to sail around the world by the trade-wind route in 1976 and on her return to the Canary Islands in 1978 became the first woman to perform a single-handed circumnavigation (with stops). Less than two months later, Naomi James completed the first single-handed circumnavigation (with stops) by a woman via Cape Horn, in just 272 days, and in 1988, Kay Cottee became the first woman to perform a solo non-stop circumnavigation in her sloop \"First Lady\", taking 189 days. It was not until 2006, however, that a woman—Dee Caffari—completed a non-stop westabout circumnavigation. The first woman to win overall a single-handed ocean race was Florence Arthaud, who won the Route du Rhum (Saint-Malo, France, to Pointe-à-Pitre, French Caribbean) in 1990.\nIn 1982, the first single-handed round-the-world race since the Golden Globe, the BOC Challenge, was inaugurated. This event is raced in stages, with between two and four intermediate stops, going eastabout by way of the great capes, and is run every four years. The first edition was won by French yachtsman Philippe Jeantot, who won all four legs of the race with an overall elapsed time of just over 159 days. With changes in sponsorship the race later became known as the Around Alone, and is now the Velux 5 Oceans Race.\nWith the success of the BOC, the stage was set for a new non-stop race, and 1989–1990 saw the first running of the Vendée Globe, a single-handed, non-stop, round-the-world yacht race, by way of the great capes. Founded by former BOC Challenge winner Philippe Jeantot, this is essentially the successor to the Golden Globe race. The race, which takes place every four years, is regarded by many as the ultimate event in single-handed sailing. The inaugural event was won by Titouan Lamazou of France, in \"Ecureuil d'Aquitaine II\", with a time of 109 days, 8 hours, 48 minutes.\nIn 2012 the Silverrudder race was established in Svendborg, Denmark. Quickly it grew to become the largest single-handed race in the World with currently (2021) 450 participants signed up. All sailboats can participate. The race is divided into 6 classes: Small, Medium, Large, Extra large keelboats and Small and Large multi hulls. The race is more an endurance test for the skipper than a real race since the boats are so different and no handicap rule is in place. However there are some quite big groups of similar boats who has a race in the race. This being the Seascape 18, 24 and 27 as well as the X-79, X-99 and the Mini Transat 6.50s.\nSingle-handed records.\nThe theoretical distance for each course is shown, and the average speed based on this theoretical distance is shown for each record for comparison purposes. Note, however, that the actual distance sailed will be more than the theoretical distance, particularly on upwind and round-the-world courses; the actual average speed will therefore also be higher than that shown.\nCriticism.\nQuestionable legality.\nThe International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS) is the international agreement between 168 UN member nations forming the 'rules-of-the-road' to be followed by ships and other vessels at sea. Any citizen of a signing nation is bound by these rules when in international waters. As they pertain to single-handed sailing:\nRule #1(a) -- These Rules shall apply to all vessels upon the high seas and in all waters connected therewith navigable by seagoing vessels.\nRule #5 -- Every vessel must at all times keep a proper look-out by sight, hearing, and all available means in order to judge if risk of collision exists.\nSince a single-handed, long-distance sailor will need to sleep at some point, the activity may be in violation of international law. Currently there is no evidence of authorities pro-actively enforcing the look-out rule on non-commercial craft. However, in the event of an incident at sea, if the master of a vessel is found to have violated one or more COLREGS, they may be found completely liable for the costs of rescue efforts, property damages or loss, loss of income, salvage costs, environmental cleanup costs, and so on. In the event of loss of life, criminal gross negligence charges are possible. As a defence, some sailors mention:\nRule #18—A power-driven vessel must give way to: (...), a sailing vessel (...)\nIt is also a reasonable interpretation of the COLREGs to place the boat \"not under command\" and to make no way, displaying proper lighting for such, to inform other vessels that a single-handed boat is not able to perform avoidance maneuvers because the crew is asleep. No legal cases have arisen to date to adjudicate whether or not such an approach is legal, because single-handed sailing is rare and examples of collisions caused by single-handed sailing are difficult to find.\nFinally, sensor technology has reached the point where a proper watch can be maintained by electronics that alert humans. In fact the COLREGs require electronic watch-keeping if technologies such as radar are aboard the vessel. Unmanned ocean-going drones already exist and will become routine within the next few decades, and those watch-keeping technologies will become available to single-handed sailors to ameliorate legal issues arising from the failure to maintain a constant human watch.\nOther.\nWith a spate of teenagers attempting to break the age record for sailing singlehanded around the world, their parents have come under criticism and legal challenges for allowing their offspring to engage in such potentially dangerous activity. This was highlighted by the expensive rescue of Abby Sunderland in 2010, over $200,000, paid for by the Australian government."

        "title": "FC Barcelona Rugby",
        "text": "Futbol Club Barcelona Rugby is a Spanish rugby union club. The senior team currently plays in División de Honor, the premier level of Spanish rugby union. Formed in 1924, the club is a member of the FC Barcelona family. The club currently plays its home games in La Teixonera.\nBefore the Spanish Civil War, the club won the Spain Championship on three occasions and the Catalonia Championship seven times. During the 1940s and 1950s Barcelona was one of the strongest rugby clubs in Spain, winning a further 10 Spanish championships. In 1953 and 1954 they won the first Spanish league titles.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nOn September 21, 1924 Barça played its first match, a friendly against CADCI in San Baudilio de Llobregat. This inaugural match was attended by the then president and founder of the club, Joan Gamper, who was accompanied by numerous executives. Barcelona won the match 9-5.\nFrancisco Baltasar Albèniz was made delegate of the rugby club by Gamper, who was a great admirer of the rugby and who saw Baltasar as a true FC Barcelona man, and a real pioneer of this sport in Spain. For the club's silver anniversary, two international matches were staged: the first against Stade Toulousain, reigning champions in France that year, and the second an exhibition against players from both Stade Toulousain and MSP Perpignan. Both matches were played in Les Corts, and despite the lack of grass pitches, the French players gave a great demonstration of their skills.\nEarly years.\nIn the 1925–26 season, Barcelona rose in the ranks of Spanish rugby and, under Corominas their coach, put together a formidable XV: Blasco, Aximeno, Folch, Fuste, Carreras, Aguilar, Bori, Estapé, Fontanella, Pujalte, Rufus, Isar, Ruiz, Rues, Rossini, Baides and Miquel. They won the club's first championships in Catalonia and Spain, and went on to win Catalan championship five seasons in a row.\n1925 also saw two matches with international opponents: the first a 9-8 victory against Witte Devils of Perpignan, then champions of the Rousillón seconds, the club's first success against a French side. The second was against Stade Toulousain, who again had won the French championship and who comfortably beat Barcelona.\nContinued success.\nThe 1926-27 season was extremely successful, with the both Barcelona's first and second team winning the Catalonia Championships. The Spanish Championship wasn't held that year. A British soldiers' team visited the club, and was defeated 20-0.\nTwo more Catalonia Championships were won in 1927-28 and 1928-29. 1928 also saw Barcelona's first trip abroad, as they travelled to play Lyon.\nDuring the 1929-30 season, the quality of the Catalonia Championship was said to increase notably, but Barcelona won once again, and also won the Spanish Championship, defeating Real Madrid 39-3.\nMore success followed in 1931-32, as both Barcelona's teams won the Catalonia Championship, and also the Catalonia Cup, which was held for the first time. Barcelona won the Spanish Championship for a third time, beating Madrid away 20-3. That year they played a friendly in Valencia, their first ever match against the F.U.E., held in a packed and enthusiastic Estadio de Vallejo. Barcelona won 25-5.\nThe club experienced problems in 1933-34, when the strain of not being able to train properly and not having a home ground for two years took its toll. The Catalonia Championship was won by UE Santboiana.\n1934-35 was more positive, as the club's management rented a pitch in Avenida Diagonal, meaning regular training was possible, and a higher level of playing standards was achieved. The second XV won the Catalonia Championship, while the first XV won the second-ever Catalonia Cup.\nReorganisation.\nAfter the Civil War, F.C. Barcelona underwent reorganisation, and it was not until 1940 that friendly matches were played, in various stadia in Montjuïc, Diagonal and San Baudilio. The club board, presided over by the Marques of the Mesa de Asta, Enrique Piñeyro, gave the rugby club great support, leading to the creation of the Catalan Federation of Rugby at the start of 1941. An exhibition match against R.C.D Espanyol was played to a full house in Manresa, and Barcelona won 3-0.\n1941-42 was a golden season, heralding the club's eighth Catalonia Championship and its fourth Spain Championship. Barcelona defeated Real Madrid 28-0 in the final, before beating SEU Madrid 17-8 in the final. Barcelona's captain Sardá received the cup from General José Moscardó Ituarte, head of the National Sports Delegation at the time. Barcelona's president Piñeyro travelled with the side to Madrid to offer the team moral support.\nIn 1945-46, the first and second teams once again won the Catalonia Championship. The first team won the Spain Championship, now known as the Generalísimo Cup, defeating Frente de Juventudes de Madrid 9-3 in the semi-final, and, in Les Corts, winning the final 23-13 against SEU Madrid.\nOver the next two decades, Barcelona enjoyed regular success, and by 1969 had won 19 Catalonia Championship and 14 Spain Championships, along with the Pyrenees Cup and the Iberian Cup. They won the first two División de Honor titles in 1953 and 1954, but did not participate in the tournament for fifteen seasons thereafter. In 1966, they won the Generalísimo Cupm the successor to the Spain Championship, when they beat neighbours Universitario 3-0 in the final, led by the international player Rocabert, and club legend Ramón Rabassa as their coach.\nBy 1972-73, the club was directed by Dalmacio Moner with Francisco Gallardo as his assistant, someone who had been connected with the club his whole life. These two men, along with Francisco Baltasar, were the men who would lead the club through both triumphs and troubles.\nOne of the major problems the club has had to face regularly is a lack of a permanent playing ground. Enrique Llaudet, club president in 1966, announced a new ground was in the pipeline, but the construction of the Palau de Gel and the Palau Blaugrana obligated the rugby team to move. Once the team was able to move back to its home ground, the finished at the top end of the table in 1972-73.\nRecent years.\nSince the mid-1970s, Barcelona have been promoted and relegated several times, moving between the top three tiers of rugby in Spain. In 1985, they won the Copa del Rey de Rugby, the latest successor of the Spain Championship, but spent much of the 1990s and early 2000s languishing in the lower tiers.\nThey were promoted to the top tier in 2006, after signing an agreement to replace the downsizing USAP Barcelona, but were relegated in the 2007-08 season. According to the terms of their agreement with USAP Barcelona, this meant they were actually demoted to the \"third\" tier, the same division in which their second team were playing. This in turn meant the seconds were relegated to regional levels, and their third team was disbanded. However, both the first and second team were promoted in 2009-10, and the first team, after playing in the second tier División de Honor B for five seasons, were promoted to the top tier División de Honor in 2014.\nIn 2018, Barcelona won the first-ever Catalan Supercup, beating Santboiana 21-17. In 2019, they reached the final of the Copa del Rey de Rugby, losing 23-24 in agonising fashion to Alcobendas, who scored a converted try in the 90th minute of play. In the same season, they finished 6th in the División de Honor, qualifying for the playoffs for the first time.\nCurrent squad.\n "

        "title": "Brian Ashton (rugby union)",
        "text": "William Brian Ashton MBE (born 3 September 1946) is an English rugby union coach and former player. He has been head coach of the England and Ireland national teams.\nYouth.\nAshton was born 3 September 1946 in Leigh, Lancashire to a textile weaver mother and coal miner father Albert, who played professional rugby league on the weekends for Leigh RLFC in 1940. He earned a place at Lancaster Royal Grammar School – one of the few local schools to teach and play rugby union over rugby league.\nPlaying history.\nAfter leaving school, Ashton started working for Trustee Savings Bank in their international banking division then Midland Bank at Farnworth, Bolton. Keith Elleray, his old games master from Leigh Grammar, took him to Tyldesley RUFC, where Ashton played fly-half in his first season in 1965–6, before Elleray retired and Ashton took over his preferred position of scrum-half for 1966–67.\nAlthough offered professional terms by various rugby league clubs, Ashton moved to Fylde – where his teammates included Roger Uttley and Bill Beaumont – and then to Orrell from 1973 to be closer to his Leigh home. On finding his chances limited, he started training as a school teacher, where his first posts were at Ashton High School, brought about by the head master's requirement to introduce rugby, and Hutton Grammar School, Preston.\nAshton was in the England squad which toured Australia in 1975, playing in one game, but was never capped – the closest he came was as an unused replacement on 15 March 1975 against Scotland. He also played representative rugby for Lancashire, England North and the Barbarians.\nHis friend Dick Greenwood – England international and later father of Will Greenwood – persuaded Ashton to extend his career by playing in France for AS Montferrand, and then in Italy with Roma and Milan. As a result, he speaks Italian.\nCoaching career.\nAshton started at Leigh college 1980–81 and turned the side into a formidable team that rucked the ball at speed due to a lack of size in the pack. He was persuaded in 1981 to take up the position of history teacher and rugby master by then assistant-bursar Dick Greenwood at Stonyhurst College where Kyran Bracken was a pupil at the time and to whom he taught history. His local teaching counterparts included Ray French.\nAshton met Jack Rowell in the summer of 1985, when he toured New Zealand as assistant coach with England A. Four years later Ashton was offered an accepted a job as backs coach job at Bath, moving to teach history and coach various sports at King's School, Bruton, Somerset from 1989, where his wife also worked as a teacher.\nWorking under Jack Rowell, he helped establish Bath as the dominant team in English rugby for a decade to the mid-1990s. He took over as head coach from Rowell in 1994 and led Bath to their last domestic trophy in 1996.\nAshton then had a brief and unsuccessful spell as National Coach of Ireland from 1997 to 1998. He had been awarded a six-year contract by the IRFU but resigned 12 months later after a series of disappointing results, and against a background where arguments or disagreements with the team manager, Pat Whelan, were frequently aired in public.\nAshton was Clive Woodward's assistant with England from 1998 to 2002 and was the RFU's National Academy Manager from 2002 to 2005. In this role Ashton played a key part in the launch of England Rugby's National Academy system, creating the Junior and Senior National Academies to develop the most talented players at England A, Sevens, Under 21 and Under 19 level. Ashton also coached some of these feeder teams, including England A.\nAshton returned to Bath as head coach at the start of 2006 but was appointed as England attack coach from May 2006 to assist head coach Andy Robinson, alongside forwards' coach John Wells and defence coach Mike Ford.\nIn December 2006 Robinson was dismissed, and Ashton was appointed England head coach. He chose Phil Vickery as his captain. Ashton won his first two games in charge of the England team, firstly the Calcutta Cup tie against Scotland and secondly beating Italy at Twickenham but led the English team to a crushing defeat against the Irish National Team on his third outing. The 43–13 defeat by Ireland was England's worst ever defeat by Ireland in the 132 years of competition between the two sides.\nEngland's 2007 Rugby World Cup campaign started badly: the team only narrowly beat the amateurs of the United States, and went on to lose 36–0 to South Africa. However, having finished their group as runners up, they recorded a shock victory over Australia, won a very tight semi-final against France 14–9, and lost a closely fought final to South Africa 15–6. Despite criticism of his management, Ashton was reconfirmed as manager of England with an indefinite length contract, on 20 December 2007.\nEngland finished second in the 2008 Six Nations, losing games to Wales and Scotland. On 16 April 2008 Martin Johnson was appointed England team manager with effect from 1 July 2008, with Ashton leaving the post immediately. Ashton was offered the role of head coach of the RFU's National Academy but declined this position.\nHe was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2008 New Year Honours.\nIn September 2008 he was appointed director of coaching at the University of Bath and also successfully coached Oxford University to victory in the 2008 Varsity match.\nIn June 2010 Ashton returned to his old club Fylde to become a coaching consultant to the senior squad. He said he is prepared to contribute as much time as he can spare to assisting Head Coach Mark Nelson in the development of Fylde's senior squad. Fylde won National League 2 North 10/11 and Ashton signed for Fylde for the 2011/12 season as Technical Director.\nAshton has previously said, \"My main strength is as a coach. I see my job as improving players individually, to do the technical work with them, and also to establish the environment, the framework, in which the players operate.\" Ashton's philosophy is that the backs comprise three creative forces (the scrum-half, the fly-half and the inside-centre) and four penetrative finishers (the outside- centre, the two wings and the full-back)."

He married, 30 March 1734, Rebecca Bankson, the daughter of Andrew Bankson Jr., and his wife Gertrude Boore. Claus and Rebecca were living in Neshaminy, Bensalem, Bucks County, Pennsylvania in 1740 when he contributed ten shillings to Gloria Dei, and also at the time of the church census on November 20, 1743. In 1744, they bought a farm in Haverford Township, now in Delaware County, from Amos Lewis. The East course of the Merion Golf Club now occupies that property and their former home is the clubhouse. Claus was a vestryman at Old St. Davids Church in Radnor from 1760 to 1770 and it is presumed that he is buried there. The Merion Golf Club came to being in 1896, when members of the Merion Cricket Club (founded in 1865) opened a golf course in Haverford Township, Pennsylvania.\nTwo new courses.\nIn 1910, the membership decided to build a new course and chose thirty-two-year-old club member Hugh Wilson, a Princeton University graduate, and fine player, to design it. Merion East opened in September 1912, and the original course was closed. The West Course, also designed by Wilson, opened in May 1914. The Merion Golf Club did not officially separate from the Merion Cricket Club until 1941.\nWilson's research pays off.\nHugh Wilson had never designed a golf course, so he went on a seven-month trip to Scotland and England to study British courses. Several features of Merion East are derived from famous British courses, not the least of which are Merion's distinctive Scottish-style bunkers, which are now known as the \"white faces of Merion\" (named by top amateur player Chick Evans). Wilson's layout covers only of land, a very small area for a golf course. It was ranked fifth in \"Golf Digest\"'s \"America's 100 Greatest Golf Courses\" in 2015, and Jack Nicklaus has said of Merion East, \"Acre for acre, it may be the best test of golf in the world.\"\nWilson's designs were the first courses designed to provide both significant penalties (in terms of hazards and boundaries) for deviation from lines of play, and multiple possible means for reaching the pin from the tee. The West Course in particular is relatively little altered from Wilson's design, while the East Course has had alterations made to accommodate the widening of Ardmore Avenue. The club was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1992 for its contribution to these innovations in the sport.\nMerion has held eighteen United States Golf Association (USGA) championship tournaments, more than any other course. The first two, the 1904 and 1909 U.S. Women's Amateurs, were held at the original Haverford course. The first USGA men's tournament held at the East Course was the 1916 U.S. Amateur, won by Chick Evans. This was also the first time Bobby Jones appeared in a national championship; he was fourteen years old. Jones would win his first U.S. Amateur in 1924, also held at Merion.\nBobby Jones completes Grand Slam.\nIn 1930, the U.S. Amateur returned to Merion in late September. Earlier that year, Bobby Jones had won the British Amateur, British Open, and U.S. Open, so anticipation was high to see if he could complete the sweep of all four major championships of the time, the \"impregnable quadrilateral.\" Jones won the medal in the stroke play qualifier and cruised through the first four rounds of match play, to the final 36-hole match against Eugene Homans on Saturday. A gallery of 9,000 was on hand for the start of the match; this swelled to 18,000 by the afternoon round, forcing the competitors to be escorted to the tees and greens. After the morning round, Jones was comfortably ahead by seven holes, and when both players parred the 11th hole Jones had an 8 &amp; 7 victory (eight holes ahead with seven to play). Searching for words to describe the unprecedented feat, Atlanta newsman O. B. Keeler used the term \"Grand Slam\", which has stuck ever since. Seven weeks after the tournament, Bobby Jones retired from competitive golf at age 28.\nHogan's comeback from accident.\nMerion's 1950 U.S. Open was the site of Ben Hogan's comeback, sixteen months after a head-on collision with a bus which shattered his pelvis and nearly killed him. On the 72nd hole (and 36th of the day), in extreme pain and facing an uphill shot of over into the wind, Hogan needed a par to force a playoff, as he had just bogeyed the long par-3 17th (and the par-4 15th). From the fairway, Hogan used a 1-iron to hit a superb shot which stopped on the distant green and two-putted from for par. Hogan then defeated Lloyd Mangrum and George Fazio in an 18-hole playoff on Sunday to win the tournament. Hy Peskin's photograph of Hogan's 1-iron shot, taken from behind during Hogan's follow-through, is among the most famous pictures in golf.\nLost for over three decades, the club resurfaced in the early 1980s, and now resides in the USGA Museum. \nThe point on the 18th fairway where Hogan hit the famous shot is commemorated with a plaque.\nTrevino defeats Nicklaus.\nThe U.S. Open in 1971 at Merion resulted in another playoff, this time between Jack Nicklaus and Lee Trevino, arguably the top two players in the world at the time. Both had missed putts on the 72nd hole to win on Sunday, Trevino for par and Nicklaus for birdie. In the Monday playoff, Nicklaus had trouble early in the bunkers and was behind the rest of the round. Trevino, the 1968 champion, won by three strokes for his second U.S. Open title. It was the second of four times that Nicklaus was a runner-up to Trevino at a major championship.\nStrengthened course tests new generation.\nFollowing David Graham's win at the U.S. Open at Merion in 1981, it was felt by many that the relatively short course of about , small course area of (which limits gallery size), and lack of grounds to hold corporate tents and other infrastructure would preclude Merion from holding a major again. However, following some land acquisition nearby and lengthening of the East Course to nearly , many of these concerns appeared to be addressed. \nAfter successfully hosting the U.S. Amateur in 2005, the USGA awarded a fifth U.S. Open to Merion, held in 2013, 32 years after its last hosting of the national championship. \nJustin Rose captured his first major by posting a score of one-over-par 281 for 72 holes, good for a two-stroke victory over Phil Mickelson and Jason Day. Most of the players who competed in the 2013 Open had very high praise for the course, which featured long, difficult rough following a wet spring. The lowest 18-hole score for the tournament was three-under-par 67, posted by several players, including Mickelson. The course held up very well as a premium test of golf, in spite of pre-tournament worries from some golf media people that many low scores would be posted by the modern generation of players.\nWicker baskets.\nOn the East Course, all pins are topped with wicker baskets instead of the usual flags (which are used on the West Course). \nAs one story goes, when Hugh Wilson was in England studying their golf courses, he happened upon local sheep herders and their flocks. These shepherds held staffs that they used for herding, and the staffs all had wicker baskets at the top. In those baskets, they kept their lunch for the day so that no animals could get into it. Wilson decided to use the idea at Merion, though the exact origin has never been fully verified. One effect is that the baskets are visible even if the wind is not blowing – but they do not give the golfer any indication of wind direction at the green. They have been used since at least 1916, and are featured in the club's logo.\nThe pin markers at Merion East have several other unique features. At , including the baskets, they are taller than standard flagsticks. The poles are solid metal instead of the standard fiberglass, and the baskets themselves are colored red on the first nine holes and orange on the second nine. Interestingly, the 1950 U.S. Open was the only USGA championship held at Merion East in which the pins were marked with flags instead of wicker baskets. In 2013, club historian John Capers indicated that he did not know the reason for the substitution, but speculated that it came about because a player in the previous year's U.S. Women's Amateur, held on the same course, was unnerved when her ball bounced off a basket during match play.\nUp until around 1980, the wicker baskets were made on site by a member of the grounds crew staff. Since then, a woman, whose name and location in South Carolina are purposely kept anonymous, creates the current baskets. Anyone who wins a USGA event at Merion receives a wicker basket top. Wickers are destroyed if the wicker baskets are broken. The golf course assistant superintendents collect the wickers every night, so they will not be stolen.\nTournaments at Merion.\nMajor championships.\n^ 18 hole playoffs: 1950, 1971\nMerion Golf Club in popular culture.\nMerion Golf Club plays a prominent part in the novel \"Back Spin\" by Harlan Coben. The novel features a U.S. Open championship taking place at Merion Golf Club, during which the son of Jack Coldren, the golfer leading the pack, is kidnapped.\nIt is also the inspiration for the name of the Marion Club in Mario Golf for the Game Boy Color."

        "text": "Leland Gaither Allen (January 12, 1915 – May 20, 1969) was an American sportswriter and historian on the subject of baseball. He was known for an accessible writing style that made history more interesting, typically focusing on the people in the stories as much as the events.\nA native of Cincinnati, Ohio, Allen was the son of U.S. Representative Alfred Gaither Allen. After attending Kenyon College as a psychology major, spending a semester at the Columbia University School of Journalism, and working for the Cincinnati Reds as a publicity director and traveling secretary, he began his writing career with the \"Cincinnati Enquirer\", and wrote the Cincinnati entry in the Putnam Publishing series on the Major League Baseball teams.\nHe authored other books, including histories of the National League and American League, the World Series, and a volume about the Giants-Dodgers rivalry. He was also a frequent contributor to \"The Sporting News\", including articles to their annual publications as well as a weekly column called \"Cooperstown Corner\". In the early 1940s Allen assisted Waite Hoyt on Cincinnati Reds radio broadcasts.\nFrom 1959 until his death, he was the historian at the Baseball Hall of Fame, succeeding Ernest Lanigan. In that capacity, and with his substantial collection of biographical information on ballplayers (continuing Lanigan's work), he had a great deal of input to the first edition of the famous MacMillan \"Baseball Encyclopedia\" which was published in the same year he died.\nAlthough Allen had been inspired as a youth by his Hall of Fame predecessor's \"Baseball Cyclopedia\", he was not the \"figger filbert\" that Lanigan was. However, they did share a common interest in the personal stories of the ballplayers. This quote from Allen's SABR profile highlights their differences and similarities. The first sentence is polar opposite to Lanigan's philosophy, the remainder is right in line with Lanigan's work: \"I care very little for statistics as such. My concern is the players. Who are these men? What are they? What problems have they faced? Where are they now?\"\nIn addition to biographies, Allen was also a pioneer in gathering information about baseball parks, and published one of the first comprehensive lists of major league ballparks and their locations, in the 1961 edition of one of \"The Sporting News\" publications.\nHe died of a heart attack in Syracuse, New York while on a road trip researching a subject for a book."

        "title": "New Zealand women's national rugby union team",
        "text": "The New Zealand women's rugby union team, called the Black Ferns (), represents New Zealand in women's international rugby union, which is regarded as the country's national sport. The team has won six out of nine Women's Rugby World Cup tournaments.\nThey have an 84 per cent winning record in Test match rugby, and are the only women's international side with a winning record against every opponent. Since their official international debut in 1990, the Black Ferns have lost to only four of the sixteen nations they have played against — England, France, Ireland, and the United States. They have never been ranked lower than second in the World Rankings since its introduction in 2003. The team performs a Haka before every match; this is a Māori challenge or posture dance. Traditionally the Black Ferns use the haka \"Ko Uhia Mai\".\nHistory.\nWomen's rugby in New Zealand was rising in the late eighties, but recognition and assistance from New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU) wasn't available. It wasn't until 1989 that women's rugby started to get official recognition with the organisation of matches by provinces and clubs. On July 22 that year, New Zealand fielded their first women's rugby union team against a touring United States side, the California Grizzlies.\nTeam's name.\nThe team's name refers to the Mamaku, the black tree fern, which is a \"taonga\" (treasure) of Aotearoa. It also aligns with the colour black and the silver fern, which are iconic New Zealand sporting symbols. For example, the All Blacks is New Zealand's men's rugby team, the Black Caps is the men's cricket team, the White Ferns is the women's cricket team, while the Silver Ferns is the women's netball team.\nWorld Cup wins.\nThe Black Ferns have participated in most Rugby World Cup events since its inauguration in 1991, only missing the 1994 championship in Scotland. Starting with the inaugural International Rugby Board (IRB)-sponsored tournament in 1998, the Black Ferns have gone on to win five more titles — including the 2002, 2006, 2010, 2017, and the 2021 tournament which was hosted in New Zealand.\nFunding.\nWhile rugby is the most popular spectator game in New Zealand, the Black Ferns have suffered in the past from similar problems to any women's sport: under-funding, lack of support and lack of publicity. While the New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) and World Rugby have been criticised to an extent for not doing more to promote women's rugby, support is beginning to improve in those organisations, in large part due to the Ferns' successes. \nThe NZRU started funding the Black Ferns in 1995, therefore giving a great boost to their game, while the Black Ferns have benefitted from being included in NZRU High Performance initiatives. Along with professional coaches, the team has had access to professional development resources such as analysis. In more recent times, the team's profile has risen greatly at a grassroots level, due in great part to their string of successes, and it is increasingly seen to be a national team on the same basis as any other.\nProvincial championship.\nIn January 2010, the Women's Provincial Championship (WPC) came under severe threat after the NZRU announced that it would be shut down due to budget cuts. As the championship was a prime builder of training, skill and competition for New Zealand women's rugby, the decision was a shock for players and supporters, including former captain Farah Palmer - especially since it was a World Cup year. \nWhile NZRU said women's domestic rugby was one of many victims of the tight financial times, they faced widespread criticism for their decision. After the Black Ferns' 2010 World Cup victory, the NZRU immediately apologised and reinstated the WPC, which was renamed the Farah Palmer Cup in 2016 in honour of the Black Ferns' influential former captain.\nInternational competitions.\nThe Black Ferns have won the Canada Cup in 1996, 2000, and 2005, and the Churchill Cup in 2004. From 2002 until their last game of 2009, the Black Ferns enjoyed a streak of 24 consecutive test match wins.\nIn 2018, after the success of the New Zealand women's national rugby sevens team, all Sevens and Black Ferns players have been offered semi-professional contracts. They also played the first Test series against Australian Wallaroos, which was played on the same night as the Men's Bledisloe Cup Tests.\nThe 2018 season finished with a 1–1 drawn series against France, with France becoming only the fourth team in the world to beat the Black Ferns. The Black Ferns' loss in the final game of the year ended a 17-month long winning streak and was also the final game for captain Fa’amausili, who retired from international rugby.\nIn 2019, the Black Ferns won the annual Women's Rugby Super Series for the second time. On 31 October 2021, the Black Ferns played their 100th test match against England at Exeter. They hosted the 2022 Pacific Four Series and won their first title after going undefeated in the series.\nNew Zealand hosted the delayed 2021 Rugby World Cup after beating out neighbour Australia for the rights. New Zealand automatically qualified for the 2021 event as host. The Black Ferns successfully defended their title and claimed their sixth World Championship after beating England in the final.\n2023.\nThe Black Ferns began 2023 with a new coach and a 50–0 thrashing of the Wallaroos in their first test for the year; the win saw them retain the O'Reilly Cup another year and top the Pacific Four Series on points difference. Convincing wins against Canada and the United States in the rest of the series also added a second title to their acclaim.\nNew Zealand hosted the inaugural WXV 1 competition on 20 October, they hosted Australia, Canada, England, France, and Wales in the top tier. France ended their 16-game winning streak in their opening match with a 17–18 score. A 70–7 drubbing of Wales saw them bounce back from their early defeat in their first test in Dunedin since 1997. A title-decider with England saw a rematch of the 2022 World Cup final, the Red Roses overpowered the Black Ferns and went on to claim the inaugural WXV 1 title.\nHaka.\nThe Black Ferns perform a haka (a Māori challenge) before every international match. The Black Ferns traditionally perform the haka \"Ko Uhia Mai\", specially composed by the Māori rugby leader Te Whetū Tipiwai.\nRecord.\n\"The first four games listed below – played at RugbyFest 1990 – are not generally accepted as being internationals by New Zealand authorities. However, in men's rugby it is general practice to award full international status to any games where ONE side considers a game to be an international. As a result all games in that tournament have been treated as full internationals in this article.\"\nOverall.\n \"(Full internationals only, updated to 4 November 2023)\"\nRugby World Cup.\nNew Zealand have won the World Cup six times. They lost to eventual winners the United States in the semi-final of the inaugural competition held in Wales in 1991, but were absent from the following tournament in 1994, due to the late cancellation of the event. They defeated the United States in the final of the 1998 World Cup held in the Netherlands to claim their maiden title. They followed this up with three more consecutive titles, overcoming England in the final of the next three editions; 2002, 2006 and 2010, as well as in their fifth world title in 2017. They won their sixth World Title after defeating England 34-31 in the 2021 Rugby World Cup Grand Final.\nIn the 2014 Rugby World Cup, they lost a pool game to Ireland, while the top two teams in another pool drew their match. This saw them miss out on the semi-finals by a single table point, before going on to heavily defeat Wales and the United States to finish the tournament in fifth.\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nAllan Bunting named the Black Ferns 30-player squad for the 2024 Pacific Four Series on 1 May.\nNotable players.\nFour former Black Ferns have been inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame: Farah Palmer, Anna Richards, Huriana Manuel-Carpenter and Fiao'o Fa'amausili.\nAward winners.\nThe following New Zealand players have been recognised at the World Rugby Awards since 2001:\nCoaches.\nAll Head Coaches of the Black Ferns (1991–Present).

He was a reserve offensive lineman for the remainder of the season and playoffs, while also seeing time on kickoff coverage units.\nYates began yet another season on the practice squad for the Patriots in 2006, but was activated on October 21 and a game later made his first start on October 30, 2006, against the Minnesota Vikings in place of an injured Stephen Neal. He would go on to start the Patriots' next two games at right guard but was injured in the second against the New York Jets and was placed on injured reserve, missing the remainder of the season with a broken leg. Yates, for the first time with the Patriots, made the 53-man roster to open the 2007 season; he started the second game of the year against the San Diego Chargers, his only start of the year.\nWhen Neal began the 2008 season on the Physically Unable to Perform list, Yates started all seven games that Neal missed.

        "title": "All-time Olympic Games medal table",
        "text": "The all-time medal table for all Olympic Games from 1896 to 2022, including Summer Olympic Games, Winter Olympic Games, and a combined total of both, is tabulated below. These Olympic medal counts do not include the 1906 Intercalated Games which are no longer recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as official Games.\nThe IOC itself does not publish all-time tables, and publishes unofficial tables only per single Games. This table was thus compiled by adding up single entries from the IOC database.\nThe results are attributed to the IOC country code as currently displayed by the IOC database. Usually, a single code corresponds to a single National Olympic Committee (NOC). When different codes are displayed for different years, medal counts are combined in the case of a simple change of IOC code (such as from HOL to NED for the Netherlands) or simple change of country name (such as from Ceylon to Sri Lanka). As the medals are attributed to each NOC, not all totals include medals won by athletes from that country for another NOC, such as before independence of that country. Names in italic are national entities that no longer exist. The totals of NOCs are not combined with those of their predecessors and successors.\nList of NOCs with medals (sortable &amp; unranked).\nThe table is pre-sorted by the name of each Olympic Committee, but can be displayed as sorted by any other column, such as the total number of gold medals or total number of overall medals. To sort by gold, silver, and then bronze, sort first by the bronze column, then the silver, and then the gold. The table does not count revoked medals (e.g., due to doping).\nA total of 156 current and historical NOCs have earned at least one medal. Medal totals in this table are current through the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, People's Republic of China, and all changes in medal standings due to doping cases and medal redistributions up to 5 May 2023 are taken into account.\nThe sum total of gold, silver, and bronze medals are not equal for the following reasons:\nList of NOCs without medals (sortable &amp; unranked).\nAfter the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, 68 of the current 206 National Olympic Committees have yet to win an Olympic medal. Seven historic National Olympic Committees and the Refugee Olympic Team are also included in this list.\nList of defunct historical NOCs and special delegations with medals (sortable &amp; unranked).\nDefunct historical NOCs with medals.\nA total of 10 defunct historical NOCs have earned at least one medal.\nSpecial delegations with medals.\nA total of 8 special delegations have earned at least one medal. Medal totals in this table are current through the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, People's Republic of China, and all changes in medal standings due to doping cases and medal redistributions up to 20 February are taken into account.\nTop ten medal rankings (combined NOCs).\nThe following is the overall medal tally (top ten nations) with the records of current NOCs combined with those of their precursors (sorted by gold, then silver, then bronze), through 2022.\nSummer Olympics (including precursors).\nCurrent NOCs combined with records of precursor NOCs:\nSummer Olympics (excluding precursors).\nSeparate current and precursor NOCs (records not combined):\nWinter Olympics (including precursors).\nCurrent NOCs combined with records of precursor NOCs:\nWinter Olympics (excluding precursors).\nSeparate current and precursor NOCs (records not combined):\nTotal, all Olympics (including precursors).\nCurrent NOCs combined with records of precursor NOCs:\nTotal, all Olympics (excluding precursors).\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\nSeparate current and precursor NOCs (records not combined):\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMedal leaders by year.\nSummer.\nNumber of occurrences\nWinter.\nNumber of occurrences\nSpecial case of Germany.\nIf results for East and West Germany are combined, German athletes also won the most gold medals at the 1976 Summer Olympics and the 1988 Winter Olympics.\nVariations.\nEarly Olympics.\nFor the 1900 Summer Olympics several countries are credited with appearances that are not considered official by the IOC. Only one of these cases concerns a medal. A gold medal that is officially added to France's total is given to Luxembourg.\nOther differences from the official table are based on disagreements about which events were Olympic. This affects several of the events in the 1900 and 1904 Olympics. In addition, some sources include the 1906 Intercalated Games when compiling their medal tables.\nAlpinism and aeronautics.\nFrom 1924 through 1936, the IOC on several occasions awarded gold medals for feats of alpinism and aeronautics that occurred in the preceding four-year Olympiad. In 1924, 1932 and 1936, gold medals were awarded to 25 mountaineers from six nations for expeditions in the Himalayas and the Matterhorn. In 1936, a gold medal was awarded to Hermann Schreiber of Switzerland for crossing the Alps in a glider in 1935, the first time that had been done. Some sources include these IOC awards of gold medals in the overall count.\nAustralasia.\nAustralasia was a combined team of athletes from Australia and the Dominion of New Zealand that competed together at the 1908 and 1912 Summer Olympics. When the Olympic Games resumed in 1920 after World War I, the two nations sent separate teams to the Games, and have done so ever since.\nMedal counts:\nBritish West Indies.\nThe West Indies Federation, also known as the West Indies, the Federation of the West Indies or the West Indian Federation, was a short-lived political union that existed from 3 January 1958 to 31 May 1962. Various islands in the Caribbean that were part of the British Empire, including Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica, and those on the Leeward and Windward Islands, came together to form the Federation.The expressed intention of the Federation was to create a political unit that would become independent from Britain as a single state\nBefore that could happen, the Federation collapsed due to internal political conflicts over how it would be governed or function viably.\nAthletes from the West Indies Federation competed under the name Antilles (ANT), \nrenamed to British West Indies (BWI) by the IOC, at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy. Thirteen competitors—two from Barbados, four from Trinidad, and seven from Jamaica—all men, took part in thirteen events in five sports. The short-lived nation only participated at these single Games, as Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago competed independently again in 1964, and Barbados started competing at the 1968 Games.\nMedal counts:\nCzechoslovakia.\nCzechoslovakia first participated at the Olympic Games in 1920, after having competed as Bohemia from 1900 to 1912. The nation sent athletes to compete in every Summer Olympic Games since then, except for the 1984 Games when they were part of the Soviet-led boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics. Czechoslovakia has participated in every Winter Olympic Games since the inaugural Games of 1924.\nAfter the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia sent independent teams to the Olympics starting in 1994.\nMedal counts:\nGermany.\nGermany has competed under five different designations, including as two separate teams at several Games. Sources vary in how they present the medals won by these teams. The table below shows sourced combinations of these teams, when applied to the updated medal totals from the main table. A part of Germany, Saar, competed independently in the Summer Olympic games in 1952, but failed to win any medals. Due to most lists only listing medal counts, it's possible Saar was included as part of Germany in their calculations. Germany was banned on three occasions (1920, 1924, and 1948).\nMedal counts:\nKuwait.\nAt the 2016 Summer Olympics nine athletes from Kuwait competed as \"Independent Olympic Athletes\" (IOA), as the Kuwait Olympic Committee had been suspended by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the second time in five years due to governmental interference.\nAlthough not allowed to compete as a sovereign state at the 2016 Summer Olympics, the nation's participants were able to compete as Independent Olympic Athletes under the Olympic flag. At those games, Kuwaiti shooters Fehaid Al-Deehani and Abdullah Al-Rashidi \nwon a gold medal and bronze medal respectively as independent athletes.\nMedal counts:\nNetherlands Antilles.\nThe Netherlands Antilles participated at the Olympic Games from 1952 until 2008 as a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nThe National Olympic Committee for the Netherlands Antilles was created in 1931 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee from 1950 until 2011 upon the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles. \nAruba left the Netherlands Antilles in 1986 to become a constituent country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Between 1952 until 1984, Aruban athletes competed as part of the Netherlands Antilles. Since the Olympic Games in 1988, athletes from Aruba have competed separately under their own Olympic banner and have participated in each Summer Olympic Games since then.\nAfter the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba became part of the Netherlands as special municipalities of the Netherlands. Curaçao and Sint Maarten became separate constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. \nAt the 2012 Olympics, participants from the five islands competed as independent athletes under the Olympic flag.\nHowever, athletes from the former Netherlands Antilles who qualified for the 2012 Olympics were allowed to participate independently under the Olympic flag, in addition to the possibility of competing for the Netherlands (as for example Churandy Martina did) or Aruba (because they have Dutch nationality). Ultimately, three athletes from the Netherlands Antilles participated as Independent Olympic Athletes.\nMedal counts:\nRepublic of China.\nThe Republic of China (ROC) participated in its first Summer Olympics in 1932 under the name of \"China\". After the Chinese Civil War, the ROC retreated to the island of Taiwan in 1949, and only Taiwan-based athletes have competed on its behalf since then. In 1971, the ROC was expelled from the United Nations, but was permitted to compete under its official name, flag, and anthem in the 1972 Winter, 1972 Summer, and 1976 Winter Olympics. It was denied official representation in the 1976 Summer Olympics and boycotted it as a result. The 1979 Nagoya Resolution allowed the ROC to compete under the deliberately-ambiguous name \"Chinese Taipei\"; it protested against this decision and boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics as well, but has competed under this name since the 1984 Winter Olympics.\nThe Republic of China took part in the Opening Ceremony of the 1924 Summer Olympics, but its four athletes, all of whom were tennis players, withdrew from competition.\nMedal counts:\nRussia and the Soviet Union.\nThe Russian Federation, the Russian Empire, the Olympic Athletes from Russia and the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) are sometimes combined outside of IOC sources. The Soviet Union is often combined with the post-union team that competed in 1992. Some sources combine the Soviet Union and Russia, despite the fact that many republics which subsequently gained or re-gained independence (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan) contributed to the medal tally of the USSR, and there are sources that combine all medals of RU1, URS, EUN, OAR, ROC and RUS. On 31 January 1992, the United Nations recognized, without objection, Russia as legal successor of the rights and obligations of the former Soviet Union, but this has no significance in medal tallies.\nMedal counts:\nRussia combined with precursors\nMedal counts:\nPost-Soviet states (except Russia)\nYugoslavia.\nTeams from Yugoslavia first participated at the Olympic Games in 1920. \"Yugoslavia\" has been the designation for Olympic teams from three distinct national entities:\nThe United Nations affirmed that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had ceased to exist, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) was a new state. All former republics were entitled to state succession, while none of them continued SFR Yugoslavia's international legal personality. As a result of the U.N. resolution, individual FRY athletes were allowed to compete as Independent Olympic Participants at the 1992 Summer Olympics, and FRY was not allowed to compete at the 1994 Winter Olympics.\nThe \"Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\", consisting of the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Montenegro, participated at the Games since 1996. At the 1996 and 2000 Games, the nation was designated with the same code, \"Yugoslavia\" (YUG), as the defunct SFRY. It was rechartered as the \"State Union of Serbia and Montenegro\" in 2003 with there being no territorial changes. The \"Serbia and Montenegro\" (SCG) designation and code were used at the 2004 Games.\nTwo of the successor nations (Croatia and Slovenia) began to compete as independent teams at the Olympics starting at the 1992 Winter Games and Bosnia and Herzegovina at the 1992 Summer Games and as of the 2008 Summer Olympics, all six successor nations, former socialist republics, have participated independently. Kosovo, a former autonomous province, made its Olympic debut as an independent national team at the 2016 Summer Olympics.\nMedal counts:\nOthers.\nIn addition to the teams of Independent Olympians at the Olympic Games mentioned above—Kuwait, Russia, the former Netherlands Antilles, and the former Yugoslavia—several other NOCs were represented by independent Olympic athletes. East Timor's team in 2000 consisted of four athletes competing as Individual Olympic Athletes. In 2012, one independent Olympic athlete represented South Sudan. In the 2014 Winter Olympics, the team from India included one independent Olympic participant.\nNotes.\nDisputed participation notes.\nThe nationalities of many medalists at the 1904 Olympics are disputed as many competitors were recent immigrants to the United States who had not yet been granted US citizenship.\nExternal links.\nAll-time medal counts are compiled by various sources, often adding up related results for Russia, Germany, Serbia, Czech Republic, etc.\nSources"

It was founded by Torbjørn Yggeseth for the 1979/80 season and organized by the International Ski Federation. Women began competing during the 2011/12 season.\nThe rounds are hosted primarily in Europe, with regular stops in Japan and rarely in North America. These have been hosted in 20 countries around the world for both men and women: Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States.\nSummer Grand Prix is the top level summer competition on plastic. The lower competitive circuits include the Continental Cup, the Inter-Continental Cup, the FIS Cup, the FIS Race and the Alpen Cup.\nThe Olympic Winter Games, the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships and the FIS Ski Flying World Championships do not count towards the World Cup. However, the 1984 Olympic Games, the 1982 Nordic World Ski Championships and the 1992, 1994, 1996 and 1998 Ski Flying World Championships were counted towards the World Cup.\nGlobal map of all world cup hosts.\nThe maps display all 65 locations around the globe that have hosted World Cup events for men (58) and women (31) at least one time in the history of the competition. Râșnov in 2020 was the latest new host.\n \n \n \nScoring system.\nEach season consists of 25–30 competitions, usually two competitions on the same hill during a weekend. One competition consists of a qualifying round; first round, with 50 competitors; and second round, with 30. Qualifying round for the main event was introduced in 1990 to limit the number of competitors. The top 30 in the first round advance to the second round, which is held in reverse order, so the best jumper in the first round jumps last. The aggregate score in the first and second rounds determine the competition results. The top 30 are awarded World Cup points. The winner gets 100 points while number 30 receives 1 point. At team events only top 8 receive points.\nMen's standings.\nThe table below shows the three highest ranked jumpers each year.\nMen's tournaments.\nThere are other tournaments as part of the World Cup:\nMen's general statistics.\nupdate: 24 March 2024\nSki flying section.\nupdate: 24 March 2024\nWomen's statistics.\nupdate: 21 March 2024\nWorld Cup winners by nations.\nThe table below lists those nations which have won at least one World Cup race (current as of 24 March 2024).\nHosts.\nMen's super team.\nupdated: 24 March 2024\nWorld Cup all-time records.\nMen.\nupdate: 24 March 2024\nWomen.\nupdate: 21 March 2024\nKey people.\nTorbjørn Yggeseth was a founder of World Cup in 1979. A new function race director was established in 1988 by International Ski Federation, with its first director Niilo Halonen then called FIS coordinator for ski jumping. Before that season this function did not exist. In the premiere Women's 2011/12 World Cup season Chika Yoshida was entitled as World Cup Coordinator, but since the season 2012/13 Yoshida is called Race Director."

The Wimbledon Cup is awarded for the winner of a 1000-yard shooting match — in which the rules permit use of \"any sight\", including telescopes.\nConcurrent with the Wimbledon, service rifle shooters compete for the Farr Trophy, and Palma rifle shooters vie for the \"Doc\" Aiken Trophy.\nHistory.\nThe Wimbledon Cup is a silver tankard wrought by British silversmiths of the Victorian period.\nThe British National Rifle Association inaugurated the prize in 1866. \"The Illustrated London News\" reported on July 26, 1866, that the Wimbledon Cup was a new prize for the Wimbledon Rifle Meeting of that year.\nIn 1875, the trophy was presented to the American rifle team attending the British matches at Wimbledon by Princess Louise, on behalf of the riflemen of Great Britain. Members of the American team competed among themselves for the trophy at Wimbledon; this match was won by Major Henry Fulton. The Wimbledon Cup was taken to the United States and placed in annual competition at Creedmoor Rifle Range as the trophy for a long range match open to any rifle. Michelle Gallagher has won the most cups with five. Her family have won it seven times. Her mother Nancy H. Tompkins-Gallagher won once and her step-father Middleton W.

        "title": "Paul Hackett (American football)",
        "text": "Paul Roger Hackett (born July 5, 1947) is a former American football coach. He served as head football coach of University of Pittsburgh from 1989 to 1992 and at the University of Southern California (USC) from 1998 to 2000. Hackett was quarterbacks coach or offensive coordinator for the San Francisco 49ers, Dallas Cowboys, Kansas City Chiefs, Cleveland Browns, New York Jets, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Oakland Raiders.\nHackett began his college coaching career at his alma mater, the University of California, Davis, in 1969, assisting the freshmen in the first year and then directing them to a 13–0 mark over the next two seasons under College Football Hall of Fame coach Jim Sochor. He then was an assistant at University of California, Berkeley for four years (1972–1975), the first season as a graduate assistant, the next as the receivers coach and the final two as the quarterbacks coach. Then, at age 29, he moved to USC for five years (1976–1980) as an assistant coach under John Robinson.\nHackett then began in the NFL as offensive coordinator for the Cleveland Browns (1981–82), followed by a stint as quarterbacks/receivers coach for the San Francisco 49ers (1983–85)—during which he coached Joe Montana in the 1984 Super Bowl victory—and as offensive coordinator for the Dallas Cowboys (1986–1988).\nFrom 1989 to 1992 Hackett was the head football coach at the University of Pittsburgh. He replaced Mike Gottfried, whom he had served as offensive coordinator, just prior to the 1989 John Hancock Bowl, which resulted in a Pittsburgh victory over Texas A&amp;M.\nHackett then moved back to the NFL as offensive coordinator for the Kansas City Chiefs from 1993 to 1997. He was instrumental in acquiring his quarterback from the 49ers, Joe Montana, to play for the Chiefs from 1993 to 1994. The Chiefs made the playoffs four of five seasons, ranking fifth in offense in his last year.\nHackett moved back to college football as head coach at USC from 1998 until 2000, prior to Pete Carroll taking over. During the first season he guided the Trojans to the 1998 Sun Bowl, losing in a major upset to TCU. Hackett's final two years at the school were difficult, as the fans and alumni base turned against him. His 1999 and 2000 Trojans football teams were the first USC teams to have consecutive non-winning seasons since 1960 and 1961. The 2000 team was tied for last place in the Pacific-10 Conference. His winning percentage as USC coach was .514, compared to the school's then all-time win percentage of .691. USC fired Hackett on November 27, 2000; to do so, it spent $800,000 to buy out the remaining two years of his five-year, $3.5-million contract. Hackett felt he was clearly not given enough time to rebuild and develop his recruits, such as Carson Palmer. \"In two years, I expect to see this team explode,\" he said. He was proved correct; by 2002, the Trojans were ranked fourth in the country with a team built primarily around Hackett's recruits.\nAfter leaving USC, Hackett again returned to the NFL, serving as the offensive coordinator for the New York Jets from 2001 to 2004. He was then the Tampa Bay quarterbacks coach from 2005 to 2007. From 2008 to 2010, Hackett worked as the quarterback coach for the Oakland Raiders, after which he retired from coaching. Hackett is married and has two sons, David and Nathaniel. "

Originally, there were four members of \"The Flintstones\", but Antonio Smith graduated in 1999.\nThe name of the Flintstones rose to prominence during the successful run of Michigan State basketball including three consecutive Final Fours and a national championship. The four made up the core nucleus of the team. The players also sported tattoos bearing the name Flint, along with a basketball on their upper arms.\nThe name has since expanded to become popular to be used to refer to other basketball players, other athletes, and Flint natives.\nThe original Michigan State University \"Flintstones\" were Morris Peterson, Mateen Cleaves, Charlie Bell, Anthony Mull, and Antonio Smith."

        "title": "Roesel's bush-cricket",
        "text": "Roesel's bush-cricket, \"Roeseliana roeselii\" (synonym \"Metrioptera roeselii\") is a European bush-cricket, named after August Johann Rösel von Rosenhof, a German entomologist.\nMorphology.\nAdult insects.\nAdult Roesel's bush-crickets are medium-sized Tettigoniid between 13–26 mm in length. They are normally brown or yellow, often with a greenish shade and a rarer green form also sometimes occurs. An identifying feature is the yellow-green spots along the abdomen, just behind the pronotum, along with a matching margin along the border of the pronotum. This margin is entire, unlike the bog bush-cricket.\nMales and females can be easily differentiated, as the females have a long sword-like ovipositor at the end of their abdomen, which the males lack.\nMacropterous form.\nBoth male and female adults are normally brachypterous. However, a macropterous form, f. diluta (described by Charpentier 1825) also exists. These have much longer wings, and usually make up less than 1% of the total population, but in some populations occur in much higher numbers, usually in areas where the bush-cricket's range has recently expanded to.\nThey are more common in long, warm summers where populations reach higher densities. It has also been suggested that a very localised hostile environment may also produce a higher level of macropterous forms. The macropterous form is a dispersal phase, and it provides the advantage of reaching new, more favourable habitats, within which there is a lower density of Roesel's bush-crickets residing. Well established populations tend to be more highly brachypterous, as high dispersal ability is correlated with lower fecundity in Orthoptera.\nLife history.\nRoesel's bush-crickets have only one generation every year. In the summer and autumn, the sword-like ovipositor of the female adult is used to cut open plant stems (usually grasses) and lay the egg pods within.\nThey emerge in May as nymphs. These must go through five or six instars before becoming adults. The final instar may be the most important in determining whether the insect develops as a brachypterous form or a macropterous form. It has been suggested that production of macropterous forms may be due to juvenile hormone (JH) degradation in the final instar, which leads to a shorter period of JH presence within the nymph. This allows more flight muscle and wing production during metamorphosis.\nAdults tend to emerge in late June to early July. When the climate is mild enough, some can still be found at the end of October. Brachypterous forms disperse through the environment by walking along roadside grasses and ditches.\nEcology and vegetation preferences.\nVegetation structure and species both influence bush cricket distribution. Grass length is one of the key structural factors, as shorter grasses leave the bush crickets more at risk from predation and environmental disturbance, whereas longer grasses block out light. The height of grassland is also important in song propagation, and a higher position for stridulation is essential for many bush crickets as grasslands have a hampering effect on noise. Sward height preferences change depending on the time of year.\nRoesel's bush-crickets have a preference for ungrazed meadows, with tall grass swards, which are a component of its diet. Other parts of their diet are grass seeds and smaller insects. They also have a preference for humidity, and thus require grasslands which remain reasonably undisturbed.\nDue to its affinity for tall grasses, they can be found in a variety of habitats, including long swards at the edges of roads, field borders and pastures.\nRange.\nRoesel's bush-cricket is commonly found throughout southern and central Europe, as well as further North, in Finland, Latvia and Sweden. Its native range stretches from west Europe to western Siberia.\nStatus in Britain.\nRoesel's bush-cricket is native to Great Britain and Ireland. It is becoming one of the most commonly found Orthoptera in the British Isles, and makes up about 16% of records. It used to be found uniquely on the inland side of saltmarshes, and in coastal regions around estuaries, on the North Sea coast. It is becoming increasingly common in southeast England, as well as spreading further north. Over the past 50 years it has ranged further to the west, and large numbers have settled in areas of urban wasteland, especially near railways. It is generally found below 100 metres altitude. Extension to the species range has increased substantially since 1985.\nPresence in North America.\nDespite being native to Europe, Roesel's bush-cricket has made its way into North America. It was first reported in Montreal and Ville St. Laurent by Urqhart and Baudry (1953) in Canada. Since then its range has increased in Ontario and Quebec, and into the United States as far as Illinois. It has been forecasted that Roesel's bush-cricket will disperse even further across eastern Canada and the United States, more likely limited to areas where grasslands are left relatively untouched across the year so as to allow the eggs to hatch.\nSong.\nMale adults start to sing (or stridulate) in July to attract females of the same species. Stridulation occurs for a long time (with only very brief pauses), whilst the weather is hot and sunny. The song is characteristic of the species which allows for easy identification by experts. The song consists of continuous penetrating buzzing, at a high pitch. The sound is similar to that of Savi's warbler, or the hiss of overhead electricity wires.\nDuring the day, the male bush cricket moves to locations within the flora that lie in the sun, in an attempt to achieve the peak temperature for stridulation."

        "title": "Coastal and offshore rowing",
        "text": "Coastal and offshore rowing is a rowing sport performed at sea. In North America, this sport is often called open water rowing.\nDue to conditions at sea, coastal and offshore rowers may face difficult circumstances compared to river or lake rowers. To withstand it the boats usually are wider and more robust.\nInternational competition.\nAt present, most British sea rowing is \"traditional\" fixed seat rowing and competition is of a regional nature. France is leading the development of modern sliding seat seagoing boats, \"Yoles\", and National Competition here is well established with FISA, the worldwide regulatory body for rowing, encouraging the expansion of the sport to other countries.\nSince 2007, the competition has been renamed as the FISA World Club Coastal Rowing Challenge, thus opening the event to all Club rowers without pre-qualification.\nAfrica.\nSouth Africa.\nCompetitive rowing has been taking place on dams and rivers in South Africa since colonial times, but since May 2011 a growing number of people have participated in recreational coastal rowing in Cape Town as well. This has taken place mainly on False Bay from the naval base at Simon's Town, but there have also been regular outings to bodies of water elsewhere in the region, including the Berg and Breede Rivers, Langebaan and Hermanus lagoons, and the Atlantic Ocean in the vicinity of Cape Point. The Cape Coastal Rowing fleet now includes a range of quads, doubles and singles.\nAustralia.\nThe sport of open water rowing is in the early stages in Australia. The American model of lightweight open water boats is generally being adopted. Most open water rowing is done for recreation, but competition will soon be established and the sport is expected to expand.\nSurf boat rowing is very popular in Australia and New Zealand, and to a lesser extent South Africa. The Australian form of the sport is often featured on sporting shows in the summer months. Surf boats are four-oared vessels with pointed bows and sterns. The boat is steered by a sweep who stands in the stern and uses an oar-like rudder to control the boat. During competition surf crews start on the beach and row through the surf to then proceed to a certain number of turning points (often referred to as the can). Crews then race back to the beach. As the boat nears the beach oars are raised and the boat is literally surfed to shore. Surf boat races are conducted on a weekly basis throughout the Australian summer.\nEurope.\nFrance.\nCoastal rowing in France is a well-established activity that takes advantage of the country's lengthy and varied coastline. The sport is particularly prevalent in several key regions known for their maritime heritage and conducive rowing conditions:\nThese regions, among others form a diverse coastal rowing scene in France, where the sport continues to grow in popularity and recognition.\nIreland.\nCoastal rowing in Ireland consists of a number of associations from around the coast of Ireland. The south west coast covering counties Cork and Kerry has the highest concentration of rowing clubs and is governed by the Coastal Rowing Association (CRA),Rowing Ireland and the South West Coast Yawl Rowing Association (SWCYRA), and the South &amp; Mid Kerry Rowing Board (SMKRB). The Irish Sea from Skerries in North Dublin, heading south as far as Arklow, Co. Wicklow is governed by the East Coast Rowing Council. Antrim coast is covered by the Antrim Coast Rowing Association (ACRA), and Wexford is governed by Slaney Rowing Association (SRA).\nThroughout the summer season the different associations of coastal rowing in Ireland hold championships using either the traditional boats of the area or the Celtic Yawl. The season generally ends with the annual All-Ireland Coastal Rowing Championships, These All-Irelands involve in excess of 400 crews across a range of disciplins and is one of the biggest coastal rowing regattas in the British Isles. The Celtic Yawl was first introduced in 2002 by the Irish Coastal Rowing Federation as a means of bridging the gap between the various classes of coastal rowing boats in Ireland, it was designed by Rob Jacob and originally built by Roddy O Connor of Customworks in Cork. John Keohane of Elite Coastal Rowing is now the sole builder. The concept successfully achieved its aim by levelling the playing field for all, irrespective of the qualities of their traditional boat. examples of the classes of coastal boats in Ireland are: East Coast Skiffs, the Cork yawls, the Kerry four oars, Wexford/Slaney cots, Antrim gigs and Donegal skiffs.\nIn addition to fixed seat coastal rowing, sliding seat coastal rowing (called offshore in Ireland to distinguish) also takes place and is a fast growing rowing discipline in Ireland. Rowing Ireland created an Offshore Division in 2017 and since then over 200 offshore boats have been purchased. The highlight of the offshore rowing year is the Irish Offshore Rowing Championships. Irish crews generally participate in large numbers at the club based World Coastal Rowing Championships. Monika Dukarska (Killorglin Rowing Club) won the CW1x World Championship in 2009 &amp; 2016 while John Keohane (Kilmacsimon Rowing Club) won the CM1x in 2010. Ireland has also started to send national teams to the World Rowing Beach Sprint Finals.\nNetherlands.\nCoastal rowing in the Netherlands is gaining popularity fast. The Royal Dutch Rowing Association (KNRB) now has a committee coastal rowing. in 2018 a competition of five races was expected to be held for Yole de mers in Muiden, Loosdrecht, Medemblik Rotterdam and Amsterdam IJburg. There was also to be a demonstration race during the stop over of the Volvo Ocean Race in Scheveningen on July 1.\nSeveral rowing clubs in the Netherlands have adopted Coastal Rowing as a discipline, e.g. Roei- en Zeilvereniging Naarden. This sail and rowing club already started Coastal Rowing in 2004 with two Yole the Mers. Meanwhile, more than 50 coastal rowers practice Coastal Rowing on Gooimeer and IJmeer.\nThe committee coastal rowing also will organise a number of recreational tours and a number of clinics.\nDutch Coastal Rowing (DCR) is organising longer coastal tours.\nNorway.\nCoastal rowing in Norway is primarily practiced in Christiania Roklub, Oslo and Kristiansand. An online community of coastal rowers in Norway called Team Coastal Rowing Norway is based in Oslo. Norway has been increasingly active in participating at the world coastal rowing championships.\nSpain.\nThe Spanish seafaring tradition has left a very important heritage of coastal rowing scull boats, in another time devoted to tasks of fishing, and now used for sport and leisure activities. Among the best known are the “traineras” and “bateles”, typical of northern Spain, the “llaüts” and “faluchos”, from the east regions of Spain, and the “barcas de jábega” in the southeast Spanish Mediterranean coast.\nThe racing of Seine boats takes place each summer in the city of Malaga and in its nearby villages. Currently, there are seven oars, with a length between 7 and 9m and weighing between 850 and 1150 kg. At present, clubs in the province of Malaga are represented by the \"Asociación de Barcas de Jabega\" which coordinates its activities and races.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe Cornish Pilot Gig Association is by far the largest British sea rowing group and preserves a tradition using both original and new boats made to a closely controlled specification. The CPGA has seen a huge continuing growth over the past decade or so and new boats are constantly being built to satisfy the demand. The Cornish gig has been adopted by rowers in the Netherlands and there is a successful gig club in Wales.\nIn recent years, the resurgence in the tradition of boatbuilding in Essex has seen the development of East Coast gigs. Built by the Pioneer Sailing Trust in Brightlingsea, the coxed four Harker's Yard gigs are based on a 19th-century design. A strong racing scene has developed around these gigs and club affiliation extends from Manningtree, on the Essex/Suffolk border, to Maldon, in the south of the county. The gigs are traditionally named after fishing smacks built in Brightlingsea before WWII. The first boat to be built, the \"Velocity\", is owned and raced by Brightlingsea Coastal Rowing Club.\nOther groups thrive throughout British coastal regions: from Shetland in the North, Whitby and Scarborough on the North Sea; and Seine boat rowers on the Teign; to the Channel Islands.\nFollowing some forty years of design development using chined plywood hulls, both Guernsey and Jersey are now importing superior double and single washdeck fibreglass boats from France. Semi-washdeck, chined, double skinned, plywood quads, were under construction in Guernsey during the first decade of this century, though none were built in 2009. A Guernsey designed carbon fibre double and quad appeared in 2008. This design went into production in the UK in 2009, with a fleet being built for the 2009 world championships in Plymouth. Boat building in Jersey ceased in the '80s. All Channel Island boats are now built to FISA dimensions.\nThe open Welsh Celtic Longboat style craft introduced in the mid-70s has since the early 2000s evolved into a double skinned \"washdeck\" boat and now is the only design under construction. From 2006 FISA dimensions are followed in hull design.\nEngland (South Coast).\nCompetitive sliding seat coastal rowing has taken place on the south coast of England since the late 19th century. It is regulated by two bodies, The Hants and Dorset Amateur Rowing Association which regulates competition from Swanage to Southsea; and The Coast Amateur Rowing Association (Worthing to Herne Bay). Due to the fact that both associations were originally unified, Southsea and Worthing, the border clubs of associations, have membership in both, although each predominantly race in one. Both bodies operate under the auspices of the national governing body British Rowing.\nIn common with British flat water rowing, regattas are held in the summer months with races of around , with longer processional head races held in the winter months in more sheltered river and estuary waters. The points system to categorise athletes is slightly different but compatible with the flat water points system, with the same separate statuses for sweep and sculling.\nTalented athletes from HDARA and CARA clubs have found their way into British Rowing's national team programmes for flat water/ Olympic rowing, as the similarity in equipment used and race distance lends itself quite well to changing between the two disciplines. Most CARA and HDARA clubs have fine boats as well as their coastal boats, and club members often also compete in river events.\nCoastal boats used are coxed IVs, coxless pair and single sculls for championships, with double sculls and mixed crews used for non-championship or fun events. All boats are wider than their river counterparts with higher freeboard to cope with coastal conditions. The fours are restricted to in length (the dimensions of an old railway carriage which was used to transport the equipment before the use of cars and trailers) and the pairs and singles to . Some (predominantly HDARA and older CARA boats) have staggered seating to accommodate the rowers in the reduced length and spread the weight across the width of the boat for stability. The reduced dimensions of the boat also aid in the buoy turn, as unlike river races the start and finish points for these forms of coastal events are the same point and require a 180° \"spin\" around a marker (either a buoy, or a float with a flag on top called a \"dan\"). Bow and stroke side is reversed from CARA and HDARA to make the clockwise buoy turn more effective, with bowside pulling the boat around.\nRegatta races are typically conducted along the beach, round a buoy (one for each competitor, moored in a line), and back ( both ways). Regatta locations vary from the rough and exposed, such as Bournemouth or Shanklin to the more sheltered, such as Southampton Water.\nCrews from the Hampshire and Dorset and the Coast Amateur rowing association come together along with those from the West of England ARA each year for the South Coast Rowing Championships which is held alternately in Coastal and River Fine boats.\nScotland.\nThe Scottish Coastal Rowing Association was founded in May 2010, adopting the St. Ayles Skiff as the standard hull for its races. The St Ayles is built from a plywood kit, with the express intention of keeping the construction costs to a minimum to increase the uptake. The design was first launched in October 2009; by mid-2015, 163 kits had been sold in the United Kingdom, with over 100 launched. The class is also gaining popularity in Australia, New Zealand, and North America.\nThe first world championship for the St Ayles was held at Ullapool in Scotland in July 2013 with 30 skiffs in attendance. The next \"Skiffieworlds\" was scheduled to be held in Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland in 2016.\nCompetition thrives, both in a league system, and \"one off\" challenges. The London Great River Race is the major British event for traditional boats, attracting up to 350 crews, but there are many regular events throughout the long March to October season. A similar event takes place in Cork, Ireland every year; the Ocean to City race is traversing Cork harbour. In 2006, 150 traditional boats completed the event.\nWales.\nThe Welsh Sea Rowing Association organises a total of 21 offshore and estuary events each year. These range from league races to the Celtic challenge rowing race, an epic Irish Sea crossing.\nThe annual Interceltic Watersports competition features, amongst other events, sea rowing using both traditional and modern craft. This has greatly helped in the development of open water competition amongst rowers from the ten Celtic nations, and Welsh rowers now compete across Europe, representing Great Britain in France, Italy, and Spain.\nCeltic Sea rowers in Wales and Ireland have adopted modern designs of fixed seat boats, loosely based on the Irish currach, which itself is still used by sea rowers in both countries and the Cork Yawl, which was the base design for the Celtic yawl used for the Irish Coastal Rowing Championships run by Rowing Ireland.\nNorth America.\nIn North America (where the sport is known as \"open water rowing\"), coastal rowing typically involves longer, lighter and faster boats, more similar to flat-water racing shells, yet designed for stability and safety in chop, wakes and swells. Stability is achieved by a broader waterline beam with safety ensured through the use of positive flotation, self-bailing capacity, supplemented by the rower's seamanship skills. North American boats do not conform to the minimum standards established by FISA, because they are too long and do not weigh enough.\nOpen water boats are used for racing, recreation, touring, health and fitness and serve the adaptive rowing community. Open water rowing in North America is popular on the Chesapeake Bay, in coastal towns of Massachusetts, Long Island Sound communities in Connecticut and New York, California, and Washington. Open water racing is practiced on both the west and east coasts of the U.S. Sound Rowers and Paddlers is a Washington club which has sponsored about 15 open water races each year since 1988. \nSouth America.\nIn South America coastal rowing first occurred in Perú, in the Club de Regatas Lima. In the Atlantic Ocean, there is a small group of coastal rowers in the Escuela de Remo de Punta Carretas in Montevideo, Uruguay."

        "text": "Lightweight rowing (abbreviated Lwt or Lt) is a category of rowing where limits are placed on the maximum body weight of competitors. According to the International Rowing Federation (FISA), this weight category was introduced \"to encourage more universality in the sport especially among nations with less statuesque people\".\nAt the international level, for crew boats, the limits are:\nFor single sculls, the limits are for men and for women.\nHistory.\nThe first lightweight events were added to the World Championships in 1974 for men and 1985 for women. Lightweight rowing was added to the Olympics in 1996 but this came under threat in 2002 when the Programme Commission of the IOC recommended that, outside combat sports and weightlifting, there should not be weight category events. The recommendation was initially rejected in 2002, however in 2023, the Executive Board opted to remove all lightweight events from the 2028 Olympics. From 1996–2016, the men's Lightweight 4– was included in the Olympics and from 1996-2024, the men's and women's Lightweight 2x were included in the Olympics. Lightweight Rowing is still raced at the World Championships.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom, lightweight rowing is less prevalent than in the US. At university rowing level, lightweight categories are offered at BUCS events, such as the BUCS Regatta, alongside openweight categories. In addition, both the men's and women's lightweight boat races are contended between the universities of Oxford and Cambridge as part of the Lightweight Boat Races. In club rowing, regattas less often offer lightweight events. An exception is the Henley Women's Regatta where there are numerous lightweight categories. At the Henley Royal Regatta lightweight rowers are expected to compete in openweight categories.\nUnder British Rowing rules of racing, the lightweight limits during winter are different from those in summer.\nUnited States.\nAt the collegiate level, many larger American Division I schools can field between one and three lightweight boats for both men and women. \nIn both lightweight men's and lightweight women's collegiate rowing, competition at the school-funded 'Varsity' level is small but fiercely competitive; the \"de facto\" national championship for both disciplines is the Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championship held each year on Mercer Lake in New Jersey on the weekend after Memorial Day. However, several club rowing programs (e.g., California Lightweight Crew), which receive minimal or no school funding, consistently field lightweight crews that compete for Division III equivalent titles at the Dad Vail Regatta on the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia, and, most recently, at the American Collegiate Rowing Association Championships.\nIn the US collegiate category, the following limits apply as of spring 2011:\nIn contrast, High school age U.S. rowing teams seldom compete in lightweight categories. In recent years the practice of juniors training down to a weight has been questioned, as low BMI has been linked to health and growth problems in adolescents. In 2021, USRowing removed all youth lightweight events at USRowing-run regattas, including the Youth National Championships. However, non-USRowing regattas may still choose to offer lightweight events.\nIn the High School category, the following limits apply as of Winter 2023:"

        "title": "Sailing ship tactics",
        "text": "Sailing ship tactics were the naval tactics employed by sailing ships in contrast to galley tactics employed by oared vessels. This article focuses on the period from c. 1500 to the mid-19th century, after which sailing warships were replaced with steam-powered ironclads.\nOverview.\nEarly history.\nSince ancient times, war at sea had been fought much as on land: with melee weapons and bows and arrows, but on floating wooden platforms rather than battlefields. Though the introduction of guns was a significant change, it only slowly changed the dynamics of ship-to-ship combat. The first guns on ships were small wrought-iron pieces mounted on the open decks and in the fighting tops, often requiring only one or two men to handle them. They were designed to injure, kill or simply stun, shock and frighten the enemy prior to boarding. As guns were made more durable to withstand stronger gunpowder charges, they increased their potential to inflict critical damage to the vessel rather than just its crew. Since these guns were much heavier than the earlier anti-personnel weapons, they had to be placed lower in the ships, and fire from gunports, to avoid ships becoming unstable. In Northern Europe the technique of building ships with clinker planking made it difficult to cut ports in the hull; clinker-built (or clench-built) ships had much of their structural strength in the outer hull. The solution was the gradual adoption of carvel-built ships that relied on an internal skeleton structure to bear the weight of the ship. The development of propulsion during the 15th century from single-masted, square-rigged cogs to three-masted carracks with a mix of square and lateen sails made ships nimbler and easier to manoeuvre.\nGunports cut in the hull of ships had been introduced as early as 1501. According to tradition the inventor was a Breton shipwright called Descharges, but it is just as likely to have been a gradual adaptation of loading ports in the stern of merchant vessels that had already been in use for centuries. Initially, the gunports were used to mount heavy so-called stern chasers pointing aft, but soon gunports migrated to the sides of ships. This made possible for the first time in history coordinated volleys from all the guns on one side of a ship, broadsides, at least in theory. Guns in the 16th century were considered to be in fixed positions and were intended to be fired independently rather than in concerted volleys. It was not until the 1590s that the word \"broadside\" in English was commonly used to refer to gunfire from the side of a ship rather than the ship's side itself.\nNaval tactics throughout the 16th century and well into the 17th century were focused on countering the oar-powered galleys that were armed with forward-facing heavy guns in the bow, which were aimed by turning the entire ship against its target. Though far less seaworthy than sailing vessels and highly vulnerable to boarding by ships that rode higher in the water, the galleys were a serious threat due to their ability to aim accurate heavy gunfire low in the hulls of larger sailing ships and to escape solely sail-powered opponents by rowing into the wind.\nInitial tactics.\nThe line of battle tactic that allowed efficient use of broadside fire was not put into general use until the mid 17th century, as was described by English General at Sea Robert Blake in his \"Laws of War and Ordinances of the Sea\". The previous solution was to make sailing ships fire backwards from the stern, as a defensive measure, or forward from the bow, as an offensive measure. The latter was only partially achieved either by canting (angling) the side guns towards the bow or stern as far as the ship's structure would allow, or by placing guns on the sterncastle and firing them in an arc on either side of the forecastle. Both solutions were problematic since they created a blind spot dead ahead and made it especially difficult to hit low-lying targets, like galleys. The method that was deemed most effective by contemporaries was to simply counter the threat of galleys with other galleys.\nDespite the technical innovations, naval cannon fire also remained grossly inaccurate except at very close ranges. Difficulties in achieving standardization in metallurgy meant that all guns allowed for considerable \"windage\", meaning that bore diameters were about 10 percent larger than their ammunition. Combined with inefficient gunpowder and the difficulties inherent in firing accurately from moving platforms meant that naval tactics for sailing ships throughout the 16th century remained focused on boarding as a means of decisive victory.\nNaval tactics in the Age of Sail were primarily determined by the sailing and fighting qualities of the sailing warships of the time. Three factors, in particular, constrained what a sailing admiral could order his fleet to do.\nThe 16th century saw the development of the man-of-war, a truly ocean-going warship, carrying square-rigged sails that permitted tacking into the wind, and heavily armed with cannons. The adoption of heavy guns necessitated their being mounted lower down than on top of the fore and after castles as previously where anti-personnel weapons had been positioned through the later Middle Ages, due to the possibility of capsizing. This meant that what had earlier been the hold of a ship that could be used either as a merchant ship or warship was now full with cannon and ammunition. Hence ships became specialised as warships, which would lead to a standing fleet instead of one based on placing temporary contracts.\nThe man-of-war eventually rendered the galley obsolete except for operations close to shore in calm weather. With the development of the sailing man-of-war, and the beginning of the great sailing fleets capable of keeping at sea for long periods together, came the need for a new adaptation of old principles of naval tactics.\nA ship that depended on the wind for its motive power could not hope to ram. A sailing vessel could not ram unless it was running before a good breeze. In a light wind, the charge would be ineffective, and it could not be made at all from leeward. It could still board, and the Spanish did for long make it their main object to run their bow over an enemy's sides and invade the deck. In order to carry out this kind of attack they would naturally try to get to windward and then bear down before the wind in line abreast ship upon ship. But an opponent to leeward could always baffle this attack by edging away, and in the meantime fire with his broadside to cripple his opponent's spars.\nAn important organizational innovation was made by Sir Francis Drake. Prior to his leadership, a warship was typically run by a committee of the sailing master, navigator, master-gunner, and captain of marines presided over by an aristocrat. Drake saw no purpose in having a member of the aristocracy without specialist knowledge and established the principle that the captain of the ship would be in sole command based upon his skill and experience rather than social position. This transformation was never quite made in the Spanish Navy where the \"gentlemen\" continued to obstruct operations throughout the Age of Sail.\nThe Revolutionary French Navy made an opposite mistake in promoting seamen without sufficient experience or training, which worked well in the army, but not at sea. The Royal Navy by contrast was well served by many distinguished commanders of middle-class origin, such as Horatio Nelson (son of a parson), Jervis (son of a solicitor) or Collingwood (son of a butcher) as well as by aristocrats who proved themselves at sea such as Thomas Cochrane and even members of the working-class, such as John Benbow.\nLine of battle.\nThe first recorded mention of the use of a \"line of battle\" tactic is attested from 1500. The \"Instructions\" provided in 1500 by King Manuel I of Portugal to the commander of a fleet dispatched to the Indian Ocean suggests its use predated the written instructions. Portuguese fleets overseas deployed in line ahead, firing one broadside and then putting about in order to return and discharge the other, resolving battles by gunnery alone. In a treatise of 1555, \"The Art of War at Sea\", Portuguese theorist on naval warfare and shipbuilding, Fernão de Oliveira, recognized that at sea, the Portuguese \"fight at a distance, as if from walls and fortresses...\". He recommended the single line ahead as the ideal combat formation.\nAn early line of battle tactic had been used by the Fourth Portuguese India Armada in the Battle of Calicut, under Vasco da Gama in 1502, near Malabar, against a Muslim fleet. One of the earliest recorded deliberate uses is also documented in the First Battle of Cannanore between the Third Portuguese India Armada under João da Nova and the naval forces of Calicut, earlier in the same year. This early use of this strategy also consisted in its implementation, in both battles, on only one side of the contenders.\nThe evolution of naval cannons during the first half of the 17th century soon led to the conclusion that the fleet had to fight in a single line to make the maximum use of its firepower without one ship's getting in the way of another.\nThe line of battle was traditionally attributed to the navy of the Commonwealth of England and especially to General at Sea Robert Blake who wrote the \"Sailing and Fighting Instructions\" of 1653. One of the first documented deliberate uses seems to be somewhat earlier in the action of 18 September 1639 by Dutch Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp against the Spanish. The tactic was used by both sides in the Anglo-Dutch Wars, and was codified in written 'fighting instructions'. These formed the basis of the whole tactical system of the 17th and 18th centuries in naval warfare.\nOne consequence of the line of battle was that a ship had to be strong enough to stand in it. In the old type of mêlée battle a small ship could seek out an opponent of her own size, or combine with others to attack a larger one. As the line of battle was adopted, navies began to distinguish between vessels that were fit to form parts of the line in action, and smaller ships that were not. By the time the line of battle was firmly established as the standard tactical formation during the 1660s, merchant ships and lightly-armed warships became less able to sustain their place in a pitched battle. In the line of battle, each ship had to stand and fight the opposing ship in the enemy line, however powerful she might be. A purpose-built warship large and powerful enough to stand in the line of battle came to be known as a ship of the line.\nImportance of the weather gage.\nHolding the weather, or windward, gage conferred several important tactical advantages. The admiral holding the weather gage held the tactical initiative, able to accept battle by bearing down on his opponent or to refuse it by remaining upwind. The fleet with the lee gage could avoid battle by withdrawing to leeward, but could not force action. Even retreating downwind could be difficult once two fleets were at close quarters because the ships risked being raked as they turned downwind. A second disadvantage of the leeward gage was that in anything more than a light wind, a sailing ship that is sailing close hauled (or beating) will heel to leeward under the pressure of the wind on its sails. The ships of a fleet on the leeward gage heel away from their opponents, exposing part of their bottoms to shot. If a ship is penetrated in an area of the hull that is normally under water, she is then in danger of taking on water or even sinking when on the other tack. This is known as \"hulled between wind and water\". Finally, smoke from the gunfire of the ships to windward would blow down on the fleet on the leeward gage. It was common for battles to involve days of manoeuvring as one admiral strove to take the weather gage from his opponent in order to force him to action, as at the battles of Ushant (1778), St Lucia Channel (1780) and the First of June (1794).\nOnly in heavy weather could the windward gage become a disadvantage, because the lower gun ports on the leeward side of a ship would be awash, preventing her from opening her lower-deck ports to use the guns – or risking being swamped if she did. So, in strong winds, a ship attacking from windward would not be able to bring her heavy lower-deck guns into action, while the enemy ship to leeward would have no such problem as the guns on her windward side would be raised by the heel. For this reason, Admiral Rodney ordered his ships to attack the Spanish from leeward in the stormy weather at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent in 1780.\nDevelopment of tactics in the French Navy.\nIn the French Navy, sailing tactics were developed by the treatises of the French tacticians Paul Hoste, Bigot de Morogues and Bourde de Villehuet, which developed the traditional code of practice and were all translated into other languages.\nDuring the 18th century, French governments developed the strategic doctrine of focusing on the mission, rather than fighting for command of the sea. The French government was often reluctant to take tactical risks to achieve its strategic objectives. The navy was hampered by the timidity of its orders. French fleets and squadrons typically sought to avoid battle rather than risk a contest with a British force, as De Ternay did in June 1780 on meeting a smaller British squadron under Cornwallis off Bermuda.\nThis strategy had important tactical ramifications. French ships tended to fire at the rigging of their opponents to disable them and allow the French ships to escape and continue with their mission. French ships typically fired their broadsides on the upward roll of the ship, disabling their opponents but doing little damage to the enemy ships or their crews. This was compounded by the French tendency to fight from the leeward gage, causing the guns to point high as the ships heeled with the wind. British and Dutch ships, by contrast, tended to use the opposite tactic of firing on the downward roll into the enemy hulls, causing a storm of flying splinters that killed and maimed the enemy gun crews. This difference in tactics goes some way to explaining the difference in casualty figures between British and French crews, with French fleets tending to suffer not only more casualties but also a higher proportion of killed than wounded.\nTactical stagnation in the mid-18th century.\nWhen the conflict came to be between the British and the French in the 18th century, battles between equal or approximately equal forces became largely inconclusive. The French, who had fewer ships than the British throughout the century, were anxious to fight at the least possible cost, lest their fleet should be worn out by severe action, leaving Britain with an unreachable numerical superiority. Therefore, they preferred to engage to leeward, a position which left them free to retreat before the wind. They allowed the British fleet to get to windward, and when it was parallel with them and bore up before the wind to attack, they moved onwards. The attacking fleet had then to advance, not directly before the wind with its ships moving along lines perpendicular to the line attacked, but in slanting or curving lines. The assailants would be thrown into \"a bow and quarter line\" – with the bow of the second level with the after part of the first and so on from end to end. In the case of a number of ships of various powers of sailing, it was a difficult formation to maintain.\nThe result was often that the ships of the attacking line which were steering to attack the enemy's centre came into action first and were liable to be crippled in the rigging. If the same formation was to be maintained, the others were now limited to the speed of the injured vessels, and the enemy to leeward slipped away. At all times a fleet advancing from windward was liable to injury in spars, even if the leeward fleet did not deliberately aim at them. The leeward ships would be leaning away from the wind, and their shot would always have a tendency to fly high. So long as the assailant remained to windward, the ships to leeward could always slip off.\nThe wars of the 18th century produced a series of tactically indecisive naval battles between evenly matched fleets in line ahead, such as Málaga (1704), Rügen (1715), Toulon (1744), Minorca (1756), Negapatam (1758), Cuddalore (1758), Pondicherry (1759), Ushant (1778), Dogger Bank (1781), the Chesapeake (1781), Hogland (1788) and Öland (1789). Although a few of these battles had important \"strategic\" consequences, like the Chesapeake which the British needed to win, all were \"tactically\" indecisive. Many admirals began to believe that a contest between two equally matched fleets could not produce a decisive result. The tactically decisive actions of the 18th century were all chase actions, where one fleet was clearly superior to the other, such as the two battles of Finisterre (1747), and those at Lagos (1759), Quiberon Bay (1759) and Cape St. Vincent (1780).\nBritish naval innovation was further slowed by an unseemly dispute between two admirals in the aftermath of the Battle of Toulon. The British fleet under Admiral Thomas Mathews had been unable to draw level with the French fleet, but Mathews nevertheless ordered an attack, intending all the British ships to attack the French rear. He had no signals by which he could communicate his intentions, and the rear squadron under Vice Admiral Richard Lestock, his rival and second-in-command, obtusely remained at the prescribed intervals in line ahead, far to the rear of the action. A subsequent series of courts-martial, in which political influence was brought to bear by Lestock's friends in Parliament, punished Mathews and those captains who had supported him in the battle, and vindicated Lestock. In several future actions, admirals who were tempted to deviate from the Admiralty's fighting instructions were reminded of Mathews's fate.\nDevelopments during the American War of Independence.\nThe unsatisfactory character of the accepted method of fighting battles at sea had begun to be obvious to naval officers, both French and British, by the later 18th century and began to be addressed during the numerous battles of the American War of Independence. It was clear that the only way to produce decisive results was to concentrate the attack on part of the enemy's line, preferably the rear since the centre would have to turn to its support.\nThe great French admiral Suffren condemned naval tactics as being little better than so many excuses for avoiding a real fight. He endeavoured to find a better method, by concentrating superior forces on parts of his opponent's line in some of his actions with the British fleet in the East Indies in 1782 and 1783, such as the Battle of Sadras where Suffren tried to double the rear of the British line. But his orders were ill obeyed, his opponent Sir Edward Hughes was competent, and the quality of his fleet was not superior to the British.\nSimilarly, the British admiral Rodney, in the Battle of Martinique in the West Indies in 1780, tried to concentrate a superior force on part of his enemy's line by throwing a greater number of British ships on the rear of the French line. But his directions were misunderstood and not properly executed. Moreover, he did not then go beyond trying to place a larger number of ships in action to windward against a smaller number to leeward by arranging them at a lesser distance than two-cables length. An enemy who took the simple and obvious course of closing his line could baffle the attack, and while the retreat to leeward remained open could still slip away. Like Suffren, Rodney was a great tactician, but a difficult man to work with who failed to explain his intentions to his subordinates.\nAt the Battle of the Saintes on 12 April 1782, Rodney was induced, by a change in the wind and the resulting disorder in the French line, to break his own line and pass through the enemy line. The effect was decisive. The guns of the British ships were concentrated on a handful of French ships as the British broke through the French line in three places, and the tactical cohesion of the French fleet was destroyed. By the end of the battle, Rodney had taken the French flagship and four other ships. The successful result of this departure from the old practice of keeping the line intact throughout the battle ruined the moral authority of the orthodox system of tactics.\nSir John Clerk of Eldin.\nThe inconclusive results of so many battles at sea interested Sir John Clerk of Eldin (1728–1812), a gentleman of the Scottish Enlightenment, illustrator of geologist James Hutton's \"Theory of the Earth\", and great-uncle of James Clerk Maxwell. He began developing a series of speculations and calculations which he initially published in pamphlets, distributing them among naval officers, and published in book form as \"An Essay on Naval Tactics\" in 1790, 1797 and 1804.\nThe hypothesis which governed all of Clerk's demonstrations was that as the British navy was superior in gunnery and seamanship to their enemy, it was in their interest to produce a mêlée. He advanced various ingenious suggestions for concentrating superior forces on parts of the enemy's line – by preference on the rear, since the centre must lose time in turning to its support.\nTechnical innovations in the late 18th century.\nBy the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793, a series of technical innovations first introduced during the American War of Independence had combined to give the British fleet a distinct superiority over the ships of the French and Spanish navies. These innovations were:\nDevelopments during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.\nBy the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793, technical innovations and the disorganization of the French navy wrought by the revolution, had combined to give British ships a distinct superiority over the ships of the French and Spanish navies. Britain had a far larger ocean trade than any of her main enemies, and a much bigger reserve of professional seamen from which to man warships. Throughout the 18th century the French and, particularly, the Spanish navy suffered from serious manning difficulties and were often forced to complete the ships' crews with soldiers or landsmen.\nBritish ships not only had a higher proportion of seamen, but the long months at sea on blockade or convoy escort gave British captains plenty of opportunities to train their crews. British gun crews achieved a higher rate of fire than French or Spanish gun crews, contributing to the much higher casualties suffered by ships from those fleets. The better seamanship, faster gunnery and higher morale of British crews was a decisive advantage.\nThe leading British admirals like Howe devoted their efforts to how to break the enemy's line in order to bring on the kind of pell mell battle that would bring decisive results. At the Battle of the First of June in 1794, Lord Howe ordered his fleet to steer through the enemy, and then engage the French ships from the \"leeward\", so as to cut off their usual retreat. This had the effect of bringing his fleet into a melee in which the individual superiority of his ships would have free play.\nThroughout the wars, which lasted, with a brief interval of peace, from 1793 to 1815, British admirals like Jervis, Duncan and particularly Nelson grew bolder in the method they adopted for producing the desired mêlée or pell-mell action at the battles of Cape St. Vincent, Camperdown and Trafalgar. The most radical tactic was the head-on approach in column used by Nelson at Trafalgar, which invited a raking fire to which his own ships could not reply as they approached, but then produced a devastating raking fire as the British ships passed through the Franco-Spanish line.\nIt has been argued both that the tactics of these British admirals were too risky, and would have proved disastrous if tried against more skillful opponents; and also that this was an acceptable risk given the lack of a better alternative. That the tactics of British admirals during the wars of 1793–1815 had themselves no such advantage was demonstrated at the Battle of Lissa in 1811. The tactics were justified because the reliance of admirals on the quality of their fleets was well based. A vessel, while bearing down on an enemy's line, could not be exposed to the fire of three enemies at once, when at a distance less than 950 yards, because the guns could not be trained to converge on a nearer point. The whole range of effective fire was only a thousand yards or a little over. The chance that a ship would be dismasted and stopped before reaching the enemy's line was small.\nFighting at anchor.\nTowards the end of the period of sailing navies, a number of fights took place between defending fleets or squadrons anchored close to the shore or in harbours, and attacking fleets forced to sail to within range while under fire.\nSuch battles tended to be decisive, as a wind which was fair to allow the attackers to enter a harbour or anchorage would let neither side out again. As it would normally be more profitable for the attackers to blockade the enemy until they were forced to sortie to accept battle in open water, such attacks were usually forced by lack of time, e.g. by shortage of supplies, the threatened onset of bad weather or the need to coordinate operations with an army on land.\nThe defenders could expect to enjoy several advantages. As they would not need to manoeuvre under sail, most of the ships' crews could man the guns. If properly prepared, the ships would have \"springs\"; extra cables bound to the anchor cables, which they could haul in or let out to veer the ship to bring its guns to bear over a wide arc. If close to a naval establishment (such as at the Battle of Copenhagen), they could rely on boats from the shore to bring extra ammunition or replacements for casualties and if in range the defending ships could be aided by coastal gun batteries. The worst British naval reverse of the Napoleonic Wars occurred during an attack on a protected anchorage at the Battle of Grand Port.\nRules and incentives.\nIn a paper in \"Explorations in Economic History\", Douglas Allen argues the long period of British success fighting under sail depended on organizational rules surrounding officers and paying officers through prizes, which were designed to encourage officers to be at sea, to drill their crews to fight, and to engage the enemy. As a consequence, the Royal Navy did not depend on superior technology, geography, or luck. The rules were discarded with the introduction of steam which allowed for direct monitoring of captains and admirals. In contrast, Allen argues the French incentives did not encourage fighting and led to a Navy better trained in sailing."

It was a natural outgrowth of the informal pick-up games started in 1984 by Arnie Draiman. The ATFI grew into a popular touch football league and in 2002, after thirteen years of touch football, renamed itself American Football in Israel and adopted flag football rules. In 2005, the Israel Football League, a previously pick-up American football league founded by Ofri Becker, merged with the AFI and began organized play with helmets, pads, referees and coaches with the AFI serving as governing body.\nThe AFI has grown to five tackle and flag football leagues, including some 90 teams and over 2000 players. In each league, teams play in colored jerseys displaying the team sponsor.\nThe Moshiko AFI men's contact league is six-on-six and played according to AFI rules. In 2008, Stevie's Boyz came back from a 21-0 deficit to upset Big Blue in the Holyland Bowl, the national flag football championship game.\nAFI operates a successful women's league, the WAFI, and the Israeli national women's team is regarded as one of the top teams in the world. The team took first place at Big Bowl III (2009) in Germany, and at the 2008 Flag Oceane tournament in Le Havre, France.\nIn the fall of 2005, the co-ed non-contact league and boys' non-contact high school league used for the first time EFAF/NFL Flag Football Rules, which is five-on-five.\nIn February 2006, American Football in Israel hosted an international flag football tournament at Kraft Family Stadium in Jerusalem. Known as \"Flag in Jerusalem\", the event marked the first time the State of Israel hosted a sanctioned international flag football competition. Six teams participated in the event including the Italian national team and Germany's Waldorf Wanderers, plus two American and two Israeli teams composed of some of the best talent the AFI had to offer.\nIn 2008, the first edition of the Israel Bowl was organized."

        "text": "The Slovenia men's national basketball team () represents Slovenia in international basketball competitions, and is managed by the Basketball Federation of Slovenia. Since the independence of Slovenia in 1991, the national team has competed at every EuroBasket, and reached the knockout stage at every championship since 2005. Their greatest achievement overall at the tournament came at EuroBasket 2017, where they won all nine games and became European champions.\nAs of September 2023, Slovenia is ranked 11th in the FIBA World Ranking.\nHistory.\nBefore Slovenia's independence in 1991, Slovenian players represented Yugoslavia. Slovenia joined the International Basketball Federation in 1992 and played its first official game on 22 June 1992 against Bulgaria in the qualification rounds for the 1992 Summer Olympics.\nFIBA World Cup.\nSlovenia debuted at the FIBA Basketball World Cup in 2006 after qualifying as the sixth-placed team of the EuroBasket 2005. In the 2010, 2014 and 2023 editions, Slovenia reached the quarter-finals; their highest overall finish is seventh place, achieved in 2014 and 2023.\nEuroBasket.\nBetween May and June 1993, Slovenia competed in the qualifiers for the EuroBasket 1993, where the team won all seven games and therefore qualified for its first EuroBasket. At the main tournament, held in Germany, Slovenia finished in 14th place out of 16 teams with one win and two defeats.\nSlovenia did not reach the knockout stages of the competition until the 2005 edition, where the team, coached by Aleš Pipan, reached the quarter-finals for the first time. In 2009, Slovenia reached the semi-finals for the first time after eliminating Croatia in the quarter-finals with a 67–65 victory. In the semi-finals, Slovenia lost to Serbia after overtime, and later to Greece in the third place game, finishing the competition in fourth place. In the next two tournaments, in 2011 and 2013, Slovenia was eliminated in the quarter-finals by Spain and France, respectively. In 2015, Slovenia failed to reach the quarter-finals for the first time since the 2003 edition after losing to Latvia in the round of 16.\nAt EuroBasket 2017, Slovenia, captained by Goran Dragić and managed by Igor Kokoškov, won the championship after winning nine consecutive games, including victories against the 2013 winners France and the 2015 winners Spain. Dragić, who scored 35 points in the final against Serbia, was named the most valuable player of the tournament.\n2020 Summer Olympics.\nSlovenia qualified for the men's basketball tournament at the 2020 Summer Olympics after competing in the 2020 FIBA Men's Olympic Qualifying Tournaments, winning the tournament in Kaunas. They won all games in the Group B, defeating Poland and Angola. In the Final round, they defeated Venezuela 98–70, and qualified for the final against Lithuania. Slovenia defeated Lithuania 96–85 in Kaunas, led by Luka Dončić (31 points, 11 rebounds, 13 assists), who with his triple-double sent Slovenia to their first Olympic appearance. Dončić was also proclaimed as the MVP of the tournament. \nAt the Olympics, Slovenia was drawn in the group with the host Japan, Argentina, and reigning world champion Spain. In the opening game, they beat Argentina 118–100. With his 48 points in this game, Dončić tied with Eddie Palubinskas for the second highest points scored in a match in the history of the Olympics. In the next game Slovenia defeated host Japan 116–81. In the final match of the group stage, Slovenia faced Spain, the reigning world champions, and beat them 95–87. Mike Tobey, who was named player of the day by FIBA, recorded a double-double with 16 points and 14 rebounds, while Klemen Prepelič scored the crucial three-pointer that put Slovenia ahead 86–85 two and a half minutes before the end.\nThe win gave them the group's top seed, and they were set to face Germany in the quarter-finals. Slovenia won their quarter-final, defeating Germany 94–70. Slovenia then lost the dramatic semi-final against France by one point, 90–89. In the last seconds of the game, Nicolas Batum blocked Prepelič's layup attempt, thus preventing Slovenia from reaching the final. In the bronze medal game, Slovenia played against Australia, and lost 107–93. Slovenia finished their inaugural Olympic tournament in fourth place, and Dončić was selected in the All-Star Team of the tournament.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\nHead coaches.\nSince 1992, the Slovenia national team has been managed by a total of twelve head coaches.

        "title": "Royal Rumble (2003)",
        "text": "The 2003 Royal Rumble was the 16th annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown! brand divisions. The event took place on January 19, 2003, at the Fleet Center in Boston, Massachusetts. It was the first Royal Rumble event produced under the WWE name after the promotion was renamed from World Wrestling Federation (WWF) to WWE in May 2002. It was also the first Royal Rumble to occur under the first brand split.\nAs has been customary since 1993, the Royal Rumble match winner received a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. However, due to the brand split introduced in March 2002, the winner received a match for their respective brand's world championship at WrestleMania XIX, either \"Raw\"'s World Heavyweight Championship or \"SmackDown!\"'s WWE Championship. The main event was the 2003 Royal Rumble match, which was won by \"SmackDown!\"'s Brock Lesnar, who last eliminated The Undertaker, also from \"SmackDown!\".\nThe primary main event from the \"Raw\" brand saw Triple H versus Scott Steiner for the World Heavyweight Championship, which Steiner won by disqualification resulting in Triple H retaining the championship, as titles do not change hands by disqualification unless stipulated. The main event for the \"SmackDown!\" brand was between Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit for the WWE Championship, which Angle won by making Benoit submit to the Ankle Lock, thus retaining the championship.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every January by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\", and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring until that PPV's discontinuation after 2002. It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The 2003 event was the 16th event in the Royal Rumble chronology and took place on January 19, 2003, at the Fleet Center in Boston, Massachusetts. It was the first Royal Rumble to occur under the first brand extension introduced in March 2002, which split the roster between the Raw and SmackDown! brands where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform on their respective shows, thus the 2003 event included wrestlers from both brands. It was also the first Royal Rumble held under the WWE name, following the promotion being renamed from World Wrestling Federation (WWF) to WWE in May 2002.\nThe Royal Rumble match generally features 30 wrestlers and, since 1993, the winner traditionally earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. As a result of the brand extension, the winner of the 2003 Royal Rumble match earned a match for their brand's top championship at WrestleMania XIX: Raw's World Heavyweight Championship or SmackDown!'s WWE Championship. This made it the first Royal Rumble to feature the World Heavyweight Championship, following its introduction on Raw in September 2002 after the WWE Undisputed Championship became exclusive to SmackDown! and was renamed to the WWE Championship. This was subsequently also the first time in which two world championships were eligible to be challenged for by the winner of the titular match.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised six matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown! brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown!\".\nThe buildup to the Royal Rumble match began on the December 23 episode of \"Raw\", when Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff informed viewers that the upcoming Royal Rumble match would feature 15 wrestlers representing the Raw brand and 15 wrestlers representing the SmackDown! brand, since this would be the first Royal Rumble match to take place after WWE's brand extension. The buildup continued on the January 2 episode of \"SmackDown!\", where a vignette aired hyping the impending return of The Undertaker in the Royal Rumble match. Later that night, Paul Heyman announced that Brock Lesnar and Big Show would wrestle in a match at the PPV, with the winner receiving a spot in the Royal Rumble match. On the January 6 episode of \"Raw\", Chris Jericho and Shawn Michaels argued over who would be drawing the #1 entry in the Royal Rumble match. On the January 13 episode of \"Raw\", a Royal Rumble qualification match took place in which Jeff Hardy defeated Raven. Later that night, Jericho defeated Batista, Kane and Rob Van Dam in an over the top rope Challenge to earn the right choose an entry number of his choice. Jericho chose #2 because #1 was already given to Michaels.\nThe main feud heading into the event from the SmackDown! brand was between Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit over the WWE Championship. At Armageddon, Angle defeated Big Show after interference from Brock Lesnar, to win his third WWE Championship. Prior to Armageddon, Angle had promised Lesnar that he would get his suspension lifted if he aided Angle in defeating Big Show. Angle had also promised to give Lesnar the first title shot after winning the championship. However, despite helping Angle win the title, Lesnar was not given his title shot as promised. On the December 19 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Angle announced that he had hired Paul Heyman as his manager and that the two had conspired to get Lesnar reinstated just prior to Armageddon, only to reinforce a stipulation that Heyman had written into Lesnar's contract that he would not receive a title shot if he had lost to Heyman's other client, Big Show, at Survivor Series. Instead, Angle signed to defend against Big Show, who was irate about being used by Heyman and Angle, but went along due to promises made to him by Heyman. Later that night, Angle lost to Benoit in a non-title match by disqualification when Big Show interfered in the match and attacked Benoit. However, Lesnar rescued Benoit from the post-match assault by Angle and Big Show and brutally assaulted Angle, injuring him. On the December 26 episode of \"SmackDown!\", as a result of Angle's injury, the SmackDown General Manager Stephanie McMahon cancelled Angle's scheduled title match against Big Show and decided that Big Show would wrestle Benoit to determine the number one contender for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble; Benoit won the match.\nThe main rivalry heading into the event from the Raw brand was between Triple H and Scott Steiner over the World Heavyweight Championship. On October 24, WWE had announced on its official website that Scott Steiner had signed a three-year contract with WWE. After eight years away from the company, Steiner returned to WWE as a free agent at Survivor Series and attacked Matt Hardy and Christopher Nowinski for insulting New York City. Steiner was then approached by both the Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff and the SmackDown! General Manager Stephanie McMahon, each looking to sign Steiner to their respective brands. He initially decided to join the SmackDown! brand, but after McMahon rejected Steiner's advances, he moved to the Raw brand. At Armageddon, Triple H defeated Shawn Michaels in a Three Stages of Hell to win the World Heavyweight Championship. The following night on \"Raw\", Triple H held an Appreciation Ceremony on winning the title but the ceremony was interrupted by Steiner, who announced that his contract said that he would earn a world title shot. As a result, Steiner and Triple H's match for the World Heavyweight Championship was made official for the Royal Rumble.\nThe secondary rivalry heading into the event from the Raw brand was between Lance Storm and William Regal and The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) over the World Tag Team Championship. On the December 23 episode of \"Raw\", General Manager Eric Bischoff forced Raw commentators Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler to wrestle in a tag team match against Storm and Regal for making bad comments against Bischoff. Ross and Lawler defeated Storm and Regal after interference by the Dudley Boyz. As a result, on the January 6 episode of \"Raw\", Bischoff forced the Dudley Boyz to wrestle 3-Minute Warning (Rosey and Jamal), Rico and Batista in a handicap match. Storm and Regal avenged their loss by costing the Dudley Boyz the match. Later that night, Storm and Regal defeated Booker T and Goldust for the World Tag Team Championship. This led to a title match being signed between Storm and Regal and the Dudley Boyz at the Royal Rumble.\nThe secondary rivalry heading into the event from the SmackDown! brand was between Torrie Wilson and Dawn Marie. At Armageddon, Torrie and Dawn did a lesbian segment in a hotel room. On the December 19 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Torrie gave bad remarks about her storyline father Al Wilson on getting married with Dawn. On the January 2 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Dawn and Al had their storyline wedding in their undergarments. On the January 9 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Josh Mathews announced that Dawn and Torrie would wrestle in a match at Royal Rumble billed as a \"Stepmother\" vs \"Stepdaughter\" match.\nEvent.\nBefore the event aired live on pay-per-view, Spike Dudley defeated Steven Richards by pinning him after a Dudley Dog. The match aired live on \"Sunday Night Heat\".\nPreliminary matches.\nThe first match was a Royal Rumble qualification match between Big Show and Brock Lesnar. After Paul Heyman distracted Lesnar, Big Show executed a chokeslam on Lesnar for a near-fall. Big Show attempted another chokeslam on Lesnar, but Lesnar countered the move and pushed Big Show into Heyman, causing Heyman to fall off the ring apron. Lesnar executed an F-5 on Big Show to win the match and qualify for the Royal Rumble match. A backstage interview occurred next where Terri Runnles questioned Chris Jericho why he decided to enter the Royal Rumble at number 2 instead of number 30. Jericho said he was trying to make himself famous because Shawn Michaels was entering at number 1 (Which he won from in the 1995 Royal Rumble and who he was feuding with).\nThe second match was a tag team match for the World Tag Team Championship between Lance Storm and William Regal and The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley). The Dudley Boyz attempted a 3D on Storm, but Chief Morley interfered in the match and decided that Storm and Regal retained the title by disqualification, but the referee refused and the match continued. Regal attempted to hit The Dudley Boyz with a pair of brass knuckles, but The Dudley Boyz performed a 3D on Regal. D-Von hit Storm with the brass knuckles and pinned him to win the titles.\nThe next match was between Torrie Wilson and Dawn Marie. Wilson performed a swinging neckbreaker on Marie to win the match.\nMain event matches.\nThe fourth match was between Triple H and Scott Steiner for the World Heavyweight Championship. Steiner attempted a Steiner Recliner on Triple H, but Triple H's manager Ric Flair pulled Triple H out of the ring. Steiner chased Flair, but the referee interjected himself to stop Steiner. Triple H attempted a Pedigree on Steiner, but Steiner countered and performed an exploder suplex. Steiner attempted a military press slam, but Triple H countered with a neckbreaker for a near-fall. Flair interfered in the match, prompting the referee to eject him from ringside. Triple H threw the referee out of the ring, but the referee did not disqualify Triple H. Triple H hit Steiner with a sledgehammer, meaning Steiner won by disqualification, but Triple H retained the title. After the match, Steiner applied the Steiner Recliner on Triple H.\nThe next match was between Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit for the WWE Championship. Team Angle (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin) were ejected from ringside before the match. Benoit attempted a diving headbutt on Angle, but Angle avoided the move and attempted an Angle Slam on Benoit, but Benoit countered. Benoit applied the sharpshooter on Angle, but Angle grabbed the ropes to force a break. Angle attempted an Angle Slam, but Benoit countered the move into the Crippler Crossface, but Angle once again grabbed the ropes. Benoit applied the ankle lock on Angle, until Angle countered the hold into an ankle lock on Benoit. Benoit countered the hold into the Crippler Crossface, but Angle countered the move into an Angle Slam for a near-fall. Benoit executed a diving headbutt for a near-fall. Angle performed a super Angle Slam for a near-fall. Benoit applied a Crippler Crossface on Angle, but Angle countered it into a modified ankle lock, forcing Benoit to submit to the hold to retain the title. Afterwards, Benoit received a standing ovation from the crowd for his performance. \nThe main event was the Royal Rumble match. The first two entrants were Shawn Michaels and Chris Jericho. Christian appeared during Jericho's entrance, wearing Jericho's gear and distracting Michaels. Jericho snuck in from the crowd and attacked Michaels from behind. He then hit Michaels with a chair, causing Michaels to bleed. Christopher Nowinski entered at #3 but instead of entering the ring, he stayed outside the ring. Jericho continued to attack Michaels before easily eliminating him. Rey Mysterio entered at #4 and started fighting Jericho while Nowinski stayed out of the ring before eventually attacking Mysterio. Edge entered at #5 and performed Spears on both Jericho and Nowinski. He attempted a Spear on Mysterio, but Mysterio countered and attempted a 619 on Edge, with Edge avoiding the move. Mysterio and Edge continued to fight until Christian officially entered at #6. After entering the ring, Christian attempted to embrace and reconcile with his former tag team partner Edge, but was speared by Edge. Edge and Mysterio then performed a double missile dropkick on Nowinski. The move was somewhat botched, causing Edge to land directly onto Nowinski's face, causing legitimate injuries.\nChavo Guerrero entered at #7. After entering the ring, Guerrero was attacked by Mysterio. Mysterio then eliminated Nowinski from the match. However, after eliminating Nowinski, Mysterio himself was eliminated by Jericho. Tajiri entered at #8. Tajiri fought with Christian, while Edge and Jericho fought with each other. Bill DeMott entered at #9. DeMott started attacking all the participants and nearly eliminated Jericho. Tommy Dreamer entered at #10. Dreamer brought a trashcan with lids and kendo sticks to the ring with him and started attacking everyone. Edge hit DeMott with a kendo stick, causing DeMott to get eliminated by falling over the top rope to the floor. Jericho and Christian then attacked Dreamer with trashcan lids and tossed him over the top rope. Tajiri fought with Jericho and attempted to apply a Tarantula on Jericho but his attempt failed, and Jericho dumped Tajiri over the top rope, eliminating him. B2 entered at #11 but was quickly eliminated by Edge, who then also eliminated Guerrero. Edge also attempted to eliminate Jericho, but he held on. Edge and Christian fought each other until Jericho eliminated both of them from the match and became the only remaining person in the ring until Rob Van Dam entered at #12. After entering the ring, Van Dam began attacking Jericho and performed a Rolling Thunder.\nVan Dam and Jericho continued to battle each other, and Van Dam had nearly eliminated Jericho until Matt Hardy entered at #13 and performed a Side Effect on Van Dam. Jericho and Hardy double-teamed Van Dam until Eddie Guerrero entered at #14 and began attacking Van Dam and Hardy. Guerrero and Hardy then double-teamed Van Dam, where Hardy helped Guerrero from being eliminated and performed a Scoop Slam on Van Dam, allowing Guerrero to perform a Frog Splash. However, Hardy ended his teamwork with Guerrero by performing a Twist of Fate. Jeff Hardy entered at #15 and Jeff began fighting Matt. Jeff performed a Twist of Fate on Matt and climbed the top rope to perform a Swanton Bomb, but Matt's manager Shannon Moore joined the ring and covered Matt with his body in an attempt to protect him. Jeff performed a Swanton Bomb on Moore, that hurt both Matt and Moore. Rosey entered at #16 and started fighting with Van Dam until Test entered at #17 and started attacking everyone in the ring. Test performed a Pumphandle Slam on Matt and began attacking Jericho and had nearly eliminated him. John Cena entered at #18, but instead of immediately entering the ring, Cena began rapping on his way down to ringside, entering the ring after finishing his rap.\nCharlie Haas entered at #19. Haas started fighting with Matt. Van Dam and Jeff started double-teaming Jericho. Jeff climbed on the top rope to perform a high-flying move, but Van Dam pushed him, causing Jeff to fall to the floor and be eliminated from the match. Rikishi entered at #20 and started fighting Rosey. Jamal entered at #21 and began teaming with his 3-Minute Warning partner Rosey to double-team Rikishi. Jericho fought with Van Dam and had nearly eliminated Van Dam, until Kane entered at #22 and started dominating all the participants in the ring. Kane eliminated Rosey by backdropping him over the top rope. After eliminating Rosey, Kane attempted to eliminate Jericho, but Jericho held on. Shelton Benjamin entered at #23 and began teaming with his Team Angle partner Haas. Booker T entered at #24 and performed a Scissors Kick on Kane and a Flapjack on Matt. Booker went on to eliminate Guerrero by backdropping him over the top rope.\nA-Train entered at #25 and started dominating his opponents by performing a Derailer on Cena, a Train Wreck on Benjamin and a Derailer on Van Dam before receiving a Savate Kick by Rikishi. Shawn Michaels angrily returned to the ring after being attacked by Jericho earlier in the match and avenged his elimination by attacking Jericho, allowing Test to take advantage and eliminate Jericho from the match. Michaels and Jericho continued to brawl to the backstage area. Maven entered at #26 but was dominated by Kane. Goldust entered at #27 and started battling Haas and Benjamin, but was quickly eliminated by them. Goldust's tag team partner Booker tried to avenge his partner's elimination by battling Haas and Benjamin, but he too was eliminated by Haas and Benjamin. Batista entered at #28 and started dominating everyone. Shortly after entering, Batista eliminated Test and then Rikishi. Brock Lesnar entered at #29 and started fighting all the participants. Lesnar eliminated Haas and Benjamin and then eliminated Matt by performing an F-5, which sent Matt over the top rope onto Haas and Benjamin. Batista and Lesnar then had a stand off. Finally, The Undertaker returned to WWE after a three-month injury hiatus by entering at #30 as the final entrant of the match.\nUndertaker quickly eliminated Cena and then eliminated Jamal. Maven attacked Undertaker from behind, trying to eliminate him for the second consecutive year, but Undertaker recovered and eliminated Maven. Kane and Van Dam started to double-team A-Train, clotheslining and eliminating him. Afterwards, it looked as if Kane was going to Gorilla press slam Van Dam on Batista, but instead Kane tossed Van Dam over the top rope, eliminating him from the match. Kane and Batista started teaming as they were the remaining participants from Raw and battled Lesnar and Undertaker, who were the remaining participants from SmackDown!. Undertaker eventually eliminated Batista and then battled Kane before eliminating him. Batista was angered at his elimination, so he angrily re-entered the ring and attempted to hit Undertaker with a chair, but Undertaker avoided it and nailed Batista with the chair instead. Lesnar took advantage of the situation and eliminated a distracted Undertaker to win the Royal Rumble match.\nAftermath.\nDue to winning the Royal Rumble match, Brock Lesnar earned a WWE Championship match at WrestleMania. As a result, he began a rivalry with the WWE Champion Kurt Angle. Chris Benoit also continued his rivalry with Angle after losing to him at Royal Rumble. At No Way Out, Lesnar, Benoit and Edge were scheduled to take on Team Angle (Kurt Angle, Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin) in a six-man tag team match, but Edge suffered a severe neck injury before the event, leading him to be written off of WWE television for over a year. As a result, the match became a handicap match; however, Lesnar and Benoit managed to defeat Team Angle. At WrestleMania XIX, Lesnar defeated Angle to win the WWE Championship.\nAfter retaining the World Heavyweight Championship against Scott Steiner by getting disqualified, Triple H continued his rivalry with Steiner over the title. On the February 3 episode of \"Raw\", Steiner became the number one contender for the title by defeating Chris Jericho. At No Way Out, Triple H defeated Steiner to retain the title."

It represents the historic county of Hertfordshire.\nThe team is currently a member of the Minor Counties Championship Eastern Division and plays in the MCCA Knockout Trophy. Hertfordshire played List A matches occasionally from 1964 until 2004 but is not classified as a List A team \"per se\".\nThe club is based at Balls Park, Hertford and also plays matches around the county at Cricket Field Lane in Bishop's Stortford, Long Marston, Brunton Memorial Ground in Radlett and North Mymms.\nEarliest cricket.\nCricket must have reached Hertfordshire by the end of the 17th century. The earliest reference to cricket in the county is dated 1732 and is also the earliest reference to Essex as a county team. On Thursday 6 July 1732, a team called Essex &amp; Hertfordshire played London Cricket Club at Epping Forest \"for £50 a side\". The result is unknown.\nHertfordshire was never considered a first-class county but its teams did appear frequently throughout the 18th century and played against some teams that were normally considered first-class, so there must have been times when the status of a Hertfordshire match was \"borderline\".\nOn 22 June 1814, Hertfordshire played against the Marylebone Cricket Club in the first match to be staged on the current Lord's ground. This fixture was repeated in 2014 to mark the bicentennial of the ground.\nOrigin of club.\nThere were a number of county organisations in the 18th century and one in 1838. The present Hertfordshire CCC was founded on 8 March 1876. It joined the Minor Counties Championship for the first season, 1895, and is the only one of the seven competing sides from that season to have maintained membership continuously ever since.\nClub history.\nHertfordshire has won the Minor Counties Championship four times, in 1936, 1975, 1983 and 1990.\nHertfordshire has won the MCCA Knockout Trophy once since its inception in 1983.

        "title": "1970 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1970 Tour de France was the 57th edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It took place between 27 June and 19 July, with 23 stages covering a distance of . It was the second victory for Belgian Eddy Merckx, who also won the mountains classification, and nearly won every major jersey for a 2nd year in a row but finished second in the points classification behind Walter Godefroot by five points. The previous year only one rider was able to keep him within 20:00 and in 1970 a mere four other riders were within 20:00, with only debutant Joop Zoetemelk finishing inside 15:00 of Merckx.\nTeams.\nThe Tour de France started with 15 teams, of 10 cyclists each, from five different countries. A few days before the Tour started, it became known that Paul Gutty had failed a doping test when he won the French national road championship. Gutty was removed from his Frimatic team, and replaced by Rene Grelin.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nAfter his dominating victory in the previous year, Merckx was the major favourite. The main competition was expected from Luis Ocaña and Bernard Thévenet. Early in the race, 86 journalists predicted who would be in the top five of the Tour. 85 of them expected Merckx to be in the top five; Ocana was named by 78, Poulidor by 73. Merckx had already won important races in 1970, including Paris–Roubaix, Paris–Nice, the Giro d'Italia and the Belgian national road championship. Luis Ocaña, who had won the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré and the Vuelta a España, suffered from bronchitis, but still started the Tour, unable to seriously challenge Merckx.\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1970 Tour de France started on 27 June, and had no rest days. After the financial success of the split stages in the 1969 Tour de France, even more split stages were used in the 1970 Tour. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet mountain pass on stage 19.\nRace overview.\nThe big favourite Merckx won the opening prologue, but he decided not to try to keep this leading position during the entire race. In the next stage, Merckx' team chased back all the escapees, so the stage ended in a bunch sprint, which was won by Cyrille Guimard as Merckx kept the overall lead. In the second stage, a few cyclists escaped, and two of Merckx' teammates, Italo Zilioli and Georges Vandenberghe, joined the escape. Merckx' teammate Zilioli was ranked highest amongst the escaped cyclists, and none of them were considered competitors for the general classification, so Guillaume Driessens, Merckx's team leader, allowed the breakaway to work, and told Zilioli and Vandenberghe to give their best. Merckx however chased his own teammates. The group stayed away, Zilioli won the sprint and became the new leader, 4 seconds ahead of Merckx. After the stage, Merckx was angry at his team leader, because he had allowed Zilioli to \"steal\" Merckx' yellow jersey, but Driessens explained to him that the other teams had spent energy to chase Zilioli, and the argument was over. Team Faema won the team time trial in stage 3A keeping Zilioli the leader with Merckx in second place.\nStage 3B was won by Marino Basso who edged Walter Godefroot and Cyrille Guimard in the sprint. Guimard took the green jersey from Jan Janssen as Zilioli kept his narrow lead in the overall situation. On stage 4 Herman Van Springel, who had finished 2nd in the closest Tour in history two years earlier and was in the top 10 of the general classification, made a late attack to go for the stage win on a slight uphill. He was caught right at the finish line and passed at the last possible second by De Vlaeminck and Godefroot, who took the stage win. Stage 5 was another split stage and Godefroot took another stage win with Daniel Van Ryckeghem and De Vlaeminck rounding out the podium. In stage 5B Jozef Spruyt and Leo Duyndam broke away with still an hour or so to race. Duyndam did all of the work and the two of them survived to the finish about ten seconds ahead of the hard charging peloton. At the very end of the stage Spruyt came around the exhausted Duyndam and stole the stage win. Following this Duyndam took over the Most Combative Rider lead from Joaquim Agostinho for the next few stages.\nStage 6 finished at the velodrome in Valenciennes where Roger De Vlaeminck took the stage win in the sprint. During this stage Zilioli had a flat tire. Normally, if the leader in the Tour de France suffers a flat tire, a teammate would offer his wheel, and some teammates would stay with him to help him get back into the peloton. However, this time Merckx was considered more important, and Zilioli was given no help. Zilioli finished the stage one minute behind. Merckx was now in the Maillot Jaune with Godefroot in 2nd by a few seconds and De Vlaeminck, Janssen and Van Springel less than a minute behind.\nStage 7 was another split stage and in the first segment Merckx went on the offensive and claimed the win. He finished ten seconds ahead of Lucien Van Impe, but won considerable time on those closest to him in the GC. Stage 7B was a short ITT, just over seven kilometers long that was run in the rain. José Antonio González Linares put in the fastest time with Merckx three seconds slower. Notably, Roger De Vlaeminck crashed out during the time trial and had to be taken away in an ambulance. Merckx rode by this scene and this contributed to him taking less risk. At the end of the day Merckx had opened up a legitimate lead on the rest of the field and now only Godefroot and Janssen were within about two minutes as Van Springel, Joop Zoetemelk and Raymond Poulidor were about three minutes behind. As a result of De Vlaeminck crashing out Tour debutant Zoetemelk became the new leader for the Mars–Flandria team.\nIn stage 8 Alain Vasseur made an escape and survived to the finish, winning the stage by over a minute ahead of the peloton as the overall situation remained the same. In stage 9, Mogens Frey and Joaquim Agostinho, teammates, broke away together. They worked together to stay away, but near the end of the stage Frey stopped working and had Agostinho do all the work, even after his team manager told him to help. In the sprint, Agostinho expected his teammate to give him the victory because he had done all the work, but to his surprise Frey started to come around him. Agostinho then grabbed Frey's handlebars, and crossed the finish line first. The race jury did not allow this, and gave the victory to Frey, putting Agostinho in second place.\nStage 10 included a climb to Les Rousses and on this stage Merckx attacked in an attempt to drop all of his competitors yet again. Only Guerrino Tosello, who was not a threat in the GC, and Georges Pintens as well as Zoetemelk were able to go with him. The time gained over the rest of the contenders was substantial as Merckx took the stage win with Pintens and Tosello crossing the line right behind him and Zoetemelk pulling up and crossing two seconds later. Zoetemelk was now in 2nd place at +2:51, Pintens rose to 3rd at +3:55. The rest of the field was considerably distanced with Gösta Pettersson rising from outside the top 10 all the way up to 4th place at +7:44 because he finished within a group including Francisco Galdós and Johny Schleck who themselves put several minutes of time into the other contenders. 3rd place Pintens was initially riding for Herman Van Springel, who was now in 5th place at +8:02.\nZoetemelk said that he would focus on defending his second place, because he thought Merckx was better than the rest of the world.\nStage 11, a split stage, was the 16th stage of the race and it began with a brief ITT just under ten kilometers. Merckx won with Linares, Zoetemelk and Charly Grosskost tying for 2nd at +0:09. 11B ended in a sprint with Basso taking his second stage win ahead of Godefroot and Janssen, all of whom were competing with Merckx in the Points Competition. Stage 12 was a mountainous stage with five notable climbs and Merckx won the stage with only Luis Zubero finishing within +2:00. He held the mountains jersey as well as the overall lead over Zoetemelk by just over six minutes, Pettersson by ten minutes followed by Van Springel, Poulidor and Zilioli. Stage 13 Andrés Gandarias claimed the Mountains jersey from Merckx early in the stage and Primo Mori managed to stay away for the stage win. Merckx crossed the line with Zubero, Van Impe and Godefroot who kept his hold on the green jersey as Merckx added another +0:38 to his lead over 2nd and 3rd place. After the 13th stage, Merckx heard that Vicenze Giacotto, who started the Faema team around Merckx, had died of a heart attack.\nStage 14 Merckx pushed himself to the breaking point to win on Mont Ventoux. This was the first time the Tour returned there since the Death of Tom Simpson. He won the stage, reclaimed the lead in the Mountains and Points classifications and now only Zoetemelk was within +10:00. After he won this stage, Merckx briefly lost consciousness.\nThe next stages were won by Marinus Wagtmans and Albert Van Vlierberghe with no major changes in the overall standings. Stage 17 was won by Luis Ocaña and stage 18 by Bernard Thévenet and the two of them, along with Zoetemelk, would be the most important rivals for Merckx in the coming years.\nStage 19 included the Col du Tourmalet and the Aubisque and was won by Christian Raymond. Stage 20 was the final split stage and Rolf Wolfshohl won the early stage as Merckx then won the short ITT ahead of Tomas Pettersson, the other Fåglum Brother riding the Tour aside from 3rd place Gosta. Merckx was now ten minutes clear of everyone. Stage 21 was won by Basso with Jean-Pierre Danguillaume being victorious the following day. The final time trial on stage 23, the 29th stage, which ended at the velodrome in Paris, was won by Merckx, with only Ocana, who would nearly defeat Merckx the following year, coming within +2:00.\nWalter Godefroot won the Points Classification and Cyrille Guimard won the intermediate sprints. Merckx took the Most Combative Rider as well as the Combination, Mountains and the Overall classifications. Zoetemelk was on the podium in 2nd, Gösta Pettersson in 3rd and Salvarani won the team classification, based on their rider's performance during the final time trial ahead of Kas–Kaskol.\nOf the 150 riders to start the Tour 100 finished. The best new rider was Mogens Frey, Jean-Pierre Genet was voted Team-Rider Number one, Luis Ocaña was voted most elegant rider and Lucien Van Impe was voted friendliest rider. There was no award for the best young rider, but Zoetemelk would have been the best rider under 25. The next year there was an award for the youngest rider to finish the Tour, a color television which was won by Zoetemelk.\nMerckx was the third cyclist to win the Giro-Tour double in one year; Fausto Coppi and Jacques Anquetil had done it before. Coppi and Anquetil were over thirty years old at their doubles, Merckx was only 25. The margin with the second placed cyclist was less than the year before; according to J.B. Wadley, the difference was that Merckx stopped attacking in 1970 after the Mont Ventoux; had he been inclined to win more time, he probably would have been able to.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were several classifications in the 1970 Tour de France, three of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, where cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, but was not identified with a jersey in 1970.\nAnother classification was the combination classification. This classification was calculated as a combination of the other classifications, its leader wore the white jersey.\nThe fifth individual classification was the intermediate sprints classification. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but only points were awarded on intermediate sprints. In 1970, this classification had no associated jersey.\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification wore yellow caps.\nThe intermediate sprints classification, sponsored by Miko, was also named \"hot spot\". In addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass-start stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. Roger Pingeon won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award. The new rider classification was first calculated in 1970. It is not the same as the young rider classification, introduced in 1975. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col d'Aubisque on stage 19. This prize was won by Raymond Delisle.\nAftermath.\nMerckx had been so dominant during the entire Tour, that the organisation was afraid the race would become dull. The director Félix Lévitan announced that rule changes were considered to break the power of Merckx's team, that he was considering to return to national teams, and to reduce the number of time trials in the Tour. The 1971 Tour did not see major changes in rules, but the number of individual time trials decreased from five to two."

        "title": "1969 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1969 Tour de France was the 56th edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It took place between 28 June and 20 July, with 22 stages covering a distance of . The participant teams were no longer national teams, but were once more commercially sponsored. The race was won by Eddy Merckx who absolutely dominated the rest of the field. As an example in 1967 nine riders finished within 20:00 of the winner, in 1968 nineteen riders were within 20:00 but in 1969 the 10th place rider was +52:56, the 20th place rider was +1:17:36 and only Roger Pingeon finished inside 20:00 of Merckx.\nThe 1969 race is the only time that a single cyclist has won the general classification, the points classification and the mountains classification as well. Eddy Merckx rode on the winning team, , and also won the combination classification as well as the combativity award.\nTeams.\nIn 1967 and 1968, the Tour was contested by national teams, but in 1969 the commercially sponsored teams were back. The Tour started with 13 teams, each with 10 cyclists: Eddy Merckx had been removed from the 1969 Giro d'Italia in leading position because of a positive doping result, and was initially not allowed to join the 1969 Tour de France, but his suspension was later lifted.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1969 Tour de France started on 28 June, and had no rest days. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit tunnel of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 10.\nRace overview.\nRudi Altig won the prologue, where Merckx finished second. In the team time trial in the second part of the first stage, Merckx's team won, and this gave Merckx the lead.\nIn the second stage, a group escaped, with Merckx's teammate Julien Stevens as highest-ranked cyclist. There were no dangerous competitors in the escape, so Merckx did not chase them. The group stayed away, and Stevens took over the lead, with Merckx in second place.\nIn the fourth stage, Rik Van Looy escaped, because he wanted to show that even at the age of 35, he should still be selected for the Belgian squad for the 1969 UCI Road World Championships. Van Looy quickly took several minutes, and became the virtual leader of the race. With less than 40 km to go, Stevens tried to defend his lead by attacking. He was followed by a group of cyclists, including René Pijnen, one of Van Looy's teammates. Pijnen was trying to stop the chase, and this angered the other cyclists in the group. The group nonetheless was able to reduce the margin to less than a minute, and Stevens conserved his lead.\nIn the fifth stage, Stevens was not able to stay in the first group. Désiré Letort, who had joined Stevens in the chase the previous stage, became the new leader, 9 seconds ahead of Merckx.\nThe first mountains showed up in the sixth stage, with a mountain finish on the Ballon d'Alsace. Merckx won convincingly: Joaquim Galera was second after 55 seconds, Altig after almost two minutes, and the next cyclist came after more than four minutes. Because Letort was more than seven minutes behind, Merckx was now the leader, with Altig in second place, more than two minutes behind. Notably, the 1965, 1967 and 1968 Tour de France winners in Felice Gimondi, Roger Pingeon and Jan Janssen were all distanced into the surviving peloton group which finished some two and a half minutes behind Altig.\nMerckx won the short time trial in stage 8, but only gained two seconds on Altig. Stage 8B was a half stage in which Andrés Gandarias and Michele Dancelli got away from the bunch by almost two minutes setting themselves up for a sprint but Dancelli pulled away near the end and won by four seconds.\nIn the ninth stage, Roger Pingeon and Merckx were away, with Pingeon winning the sprint. Altig lost almost eight minutes, and was out of contention. The second place was now taken by Pingeon, more than five minutes behind. Stage 10 saw the previous year's runner up Herman Van Springel win the stage which included the climbs of the Col du Télégraphe and the Col du Galibier. He finished about two minutes ahead of the Merckx group with the GC only changing slightly.\nMerckx added some time in the eleventh stage, which he won, and the twelfth stage, where he finished in the first group. After the twelfth stage, Merckx was leading by more than seven minutes. After he won the time trial in stage fifteen, it was more than eight minutes.\nBy then, his victory was all but assured, he just had to make sure that he stayed with his competitors. In the seventeenth stage however, Merckx did something historic. This stage would see the climbs of the Col de Peyresourde, Col d'Aspin, Col du Tourmalet and Col d'Aubisque and the Faema team controlled the pace of the bunch from the very start. Martin Van Den Bossche set a devastating pace while climbing the Tourmalet causing the surviving main field to break apart. Nearing the summit Merckx attacked to claim the points but as he cleared the summit he realized no one else was with him and he attacked again as the descent began. At the bottom of the hill several minutes later he had built a lead of about a minute and it only began to grow from there. Lomme Driessens, the Directeur Sportif for Faema, told Merckx to sit up and wait for the others while taking a few minutes to get some food in him as there was still 105 kilometers to go. Merckx didn't always agree with Driessens on tactics and had second thoughts about sitting up and waiting for everyone else to catch up. When he got his next time check and realized he now had a gap of +3:00 he decided to attack even harder and by the time he reached the summit of the Aubisque he had a gap of about +7:00. He rode consistently with undeniable power as the surviving reduced peloton just could not bring him back, or even cut into the lead he was continuously building over them.\nMichele Dancelli crossed the line in 2nd within a group of seven riders just shy of eight minutes behind Merckx. Everyone else including the defending champ was close to or well beyond fifteen minutes behind Merckx. This stage nearly doubled what was already almost certainly an insurmountable lead, and was a defining moment in cycling history when a rider did something that seemed impossible and would likely never be seen again.\nBy winning the final time trial, he increased his winning margin to almost eighteen minutes.\nJuly 20 the race ended with a split stage that arrived in Paris with a 37 km individual time trial. The winner of the Points Classification was Merckx, the winner of the Combination Classification was Merckx, the winner of the King of the Mountains competition was Merckx, the Yellow Jersey was won for the first time by Merckx, Merckx was also named the Most Combative Rider and won six stages. Before or since no other rider has accomplished winning all of these competitions in the same tour.\nEric Leman narrowly won the Sprints Competition ahead of the French speaking, Belgian-British rider Michael Wright.\nDuring the 2019 Tour de France Eddy Merckx and the 50th anniversary of this Tour were honored at the Grand Depart in Belgium.\nDoping.\nAfter the controversial doping-incident with Merckx in the 1969 Giro, the rules for doping offences were changed: riders were no longer removed from the race, but were given a penalty of fifteen minutes in the general classification. After every stage in the 1969 Tour, three cyclists were tested. These were either the first three of the stage, the first three in the general classification, or three randomly selected cyclists. Five riders tested positive: Henk Nijdam, Jozef Timmerman, Rudi Altig, Bernard Guyot and Pierre Matignon. Nijdam, Timmerman and Altig requested their B samples to be tested, but they also returned positive. Altig, Guyot and Matignon were given the time penalty of fifteen minutes; Nijdam and Timmerman had already left the race when the results came out.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were several classifications in the 1969 Tour de France, three of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification.\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, but was not identified with a jersey in 1969.\nAnother classification was the combination classification. This classification was calculated as a combination of the other classifications, its leader wore the white jersey. Specifically it combined the rankings of the general, points, and mountains classifications.\nThe fifth individual classification was the intermediate sprints classification. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but only points were awarded on intermediate sprints. In 1969, this classification had no associated jersey.\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification wore yellow caps.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. Eddy Merckx won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given to the first rider to pass the memorial to Tour founder Henri Desgrange near the summit of the Col du Galibier on stage 10. This prize was won by Merckx."

        "title": "1968 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1968 Tour de France was the 55th edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It took place between 27 June and 21 July, with 22 stages covering a distance of . Eleven national teams of 10 riders competed, with three French teams, two Belgian teams and one from Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, and a combined Swiss/Luxembourgian team.\nThe 1968 Tour marked the first time the race would end at the Vélodrome de Vincennes, replacing the now-defunct Parc des Princes Velodrome which served as the final stop from 1904 to 1967. The general classification was won by Jan Janssen, who overtook Herman Van Springel in the final time trial.\nInnovations and changes.\nAfter the death of Tom Simpson, doping controls had become mandatory. To further protect the cyclists, it was now allowed to get water during the race, and two rest days were added. To get more sponsor income, a new classification was added, the combination classification, calculated from the positions in the general, points and mountains classification. The jersey of the points classification, which has been green in all other years, was red in 1968 for sponsorship reasons.\nTeams.\nThe 1968 Tour started with 110 cyclists, divided into 11 teams of 10 cyclists.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the Tour de France was announced in December 1967. At that time, the last stage was not finalised yet, because the old finish place (the Parc des Princes) was no longer available, and a new one had to be found.\nThe 1968 Tour de France started on 27 June, and had two rest days, in Royan and Font-Romeu-Odeillo-Via. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Port d'Envalira mountain pass on stage 13.\nRace overview.\nThe initial time trial was won by Charly Grosskost, with most favourites shortly behind him. Grosskost also won the next stage, and thus kept the lead.\nIn the first part of the third stage, a team time trial, the Belgian A team won, and because of the time bonuses Herman Vanspringel took over the lead.\nThe next stages were all flat, and the favourites were unable to gain time on each other. In the fourth stage, a group without favourites escaped and won the stage with a margin of a few minutes; Jean-Pierre Genet was the best-placed cyclist of that group, and became the new leader. A similar thing happened in the first part of the fifth stage; Georges Vandenberghe was the only cyclist who had been present in both escape groups, and he became the new leader of the general classification.\nVandenberghe was now a few minutes ahead in the general classification, and kept that lead until the start of the Pyrenees after stage eleven.\nVandenberghe was expected to lose the lead in the twelfth stage, because he was not known to be a good climber. But he surprised, and stayed with some of the favourites, keeping the lead. In that stage, the Dutch team was reduced to four cyclists, and the leader Jan Janssen did not look strong. On the other hand, the leader of the French team Raymond Poulidor had gained time, and seemed to be the best-placed favourite, in fifth place in the general classification.\nIn the thirteenth stage, Vandenberghe again was able to stay at the front. In the last day in the Pyrenees during stage fourteen, Janssen won the stage, but won little time by that, as almost all cyclists were in the group just behind him.\nIn the fifteenth stage, Raymond Poulidor was hit by a motor, but was able to remount and reach the finish, although he lost more than a minute on his direct competitors.\nIn the sixteenth stage, French internal rivalry was dominating; while Roger Pingeon of the France A team was slowing down to drink, Lucien Aimar of the France B team attacked, and took a group of favourites with him. Although Aimar was later dropped from that group, Godefroot, Janssen, Vanspringel, Bracke and Gandarias stayed at the front, while Pingeon, Poulidor and Vandenberghe lost more than nine minutes, and were out of contention. The new leader was now Rolf Wolfshohl, with San Miguel in second place and Franco Bitossi in third place.\nIn the eighteenth stage, Pingeon fought back and escaped early in the stage. He was joined by Bitossi, who was keen on taking over the lead in the general classification. On the last climb, Bitossi was out of energy and lost considerable time. Pingeon won the stage, and San Miguel climbed up to the first place in the general classification. However, the top eight was within two minutes of each other.\nIn the nineteenth stage, San Miguel lost a little time on Vanspringel, who became the new leader. The next few stages did not change anything in the top of the general classification. The Tour ended with a time trial, and before the time trial, Herman Van Springel was leading, followed by San Miguel at 12 seconds, Janssen at 16 seconds and Bitossi at 58 seconds. Janssen won the final time trial, with Van Springel in second place, but the margin was large enough for Janssen to win the Tour.\nDoping.\nDoping controls were performed daily on the first three riders to complete the stage and three more riders by random drawing. Gimondi advised the Tour de France organizers adopt the aforementioned system, which was used at the Giro d'Italia earlier that year, in order for him to agree to participate in the race. In total, 163 doping tests were performed. Two returned positive:\nBoth were removed from the race, suspended for one month and given a fine.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were several classifications in the 1968 Tour de France, two of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification. The jersey for the points classification leader was red in 1968, unlike all other years since its introduction in 1953, when it was green.\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification. The leader of the mountains classification, which had been calculated since 1933 but had never had a jersey, also became identifiable by a \"macaron\" on his jersey.\nA newly introduced classification was the combination classification. This classification was calculated as a combination of the other classifications. The leader was not identified by a jersey, but wore a \"macaron\" on their jersey.\nThe fifth individual classification was the intermediate sprints classification. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but points were only awarded on intermediate sprints. In 1968, this classification had no associated jersey.\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification wore yellow caps. The Switzerland/Luxembourg team finished with only two cyclists.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the cyclist considered most combative.

        "title": "1967 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1967 Tour de France was the 54th edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It took place between 29 June and 23 July, with 22 stages covering a distance of . Thirteen national teams of ten riders competed, with three French teams, two Belgian, two Italian, two Spanish, one each from Germany, United Kingdom and the Netherlands, and a Swiss/Luxembourgian team.\nThe Tour was marred by the fatal collapse of Tom Simpson on the slopes of Mont Ventoux.\nTeams.\nThe previous years, the Tour had been contested by trade teams. Tour director Félix Lévitan held the team sponsors responsible for the riders' strike in the 1966 Tour de France, and therefore the formula was changed, and the national teams returned. The Tour started with 130 cyclists, divided into 13 teams of 10 cyclists.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nNational teams\nSecondary national teams\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1967 Tour de France started on 29 June, and was the first to have a prologue, a short individual time trial prior to stage racing, held in the evening, adding to the occasion. There were had two rest days, in Belfort and Sète. Whereas in previous years the trend had been that the Tour became shorter, in 1967 it was longer, with 4779 km. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit tunnel of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 10.\nRace overview.\nThe prologue was won by Spanish José María Errandonea, with Raymond Poulidor in second place, six seconds behind. In the next few stages, the lead in the general classification changed hands several times, but the margins between the top favourites were small.\nIn the first part of the fifth stage, in Belgium, a group of fourteen cyclists including some Belgian cyclists escaped early in the stage. On the advice of his teammate Jean Stablinski, Roger Pingeon bridged the gap and joined the escaped group. The group stayed away, and Pingeon escaped 60 km before the finish, riding alone until the end of the stage. Pingeon won the stage, and also became the leader of the general classification.\nPingeon's lead was not challenged in the sixth stage, but he lost it in the seventh stage to his teammate Raymond Riotte, after Riotte was in a group that escaped. In the eighth stage, Riotte lost considerable time, and Pingeon was back in the lead. On that stage, Raymond Riotte lost more than 11 minutes, also because of a fall and mechanical problems, and announced that he would ride the rest of the Tour in support of Pingeon.\nPingeon gained a few seconds in the ninth stage after a split in the peloton. In the tenth stage, Poulidor helped Pingeon over the major climbs, and after that stage Pingeon had a margin of more than four minutes over the next rider, Désiré Letort from the Bleuets team.\nThere were few changes in the general classification in the next two stages. The thirteenth stage was run in hot weather, and featured high climbs. During the climb of the Ventoux, Tom Simpson died. Unaware of what happened behind them, Jan Janssen won the stage, closely followed by Roger Pingeon, who extended his lead.\nThe riders in the peloton decided to ride the fourteenth stage in dedication of Tom Simpson, and let his teammate Barry Hoban win the stage.\nIn the sixteenth stage in the Pyrenees, Julio Jiménez won back a few minutes, and was now in second place behind Pingeon, 123 seconds behind. In the twentieth stage, with a finish on top of the Puy-de-Dôme, Jiménez won back some more time, and was now 1 minute and 39 seconds behind Pingeon. This was not enough to put Pingeon's victory in danger; the Tour ended with an individual time trial, and Pingeon rode it much better than Jiménez, and won the Tour de France of 1967.\nDoping.\nAfter the death of Tom Simpson on stage 13, there were accusations of doping use. The organisation decided to increase the doping controls, not only in the Tour but also in the simultaneously run Tour de l'Avenir. The Tour de France gave no positive tests, but several riders from the Tour de l'Avenir were disqualified.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were several classifications in the 1967 Tour de France, two of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, but was not identified with a jersey.\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification wore yellow caps.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award, in which a jury composed of journalists gave points after each stage to the cyclist they considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. At the conclusion of the Tour, Désiré Letort won the overall super-combativity award, also decided by journalists by a jury. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given to the first rider to pass the memorial to Tour founder Henri Desgrange near the summit of the Col du Galibier on stage 10. This prize was won by Julio Jiménez."

The team has played in the Minor Counties Championship since 1904 and became champions in 2012. They also play in the MCCA Knockout Trophy. Cornwall played List A matches occasionally from 1970 until 2004 but is not classified as a List A team \"per se\".\nThe club play home matches at various venues including Roskear in Camborne, Trescobeas in Falmouth, Boscawen Park in Truro and Wheal Eliza ground in St Austell.\nHistory.\nEarliest cricket in Cornwall.\nThe first recorded mention of cricket in Cornwall is an advertisement in the \"Sherborne Mercury\" on 18 June 1781 for the sale of cattle at St Teath, near Camelford. The advertisement was dated 14 June 1781 and signed by Nathaniel Long and finished with a note, viz \"The evening of the same day will be circketed for a very handsome silver-laced hat.\"\nAccording to Bowen (1970) a county organisation is known to have existed in 1813 and the first cricket club in Cornwall was known as the Cornish Cricket Club of Truro. The club moved to a new ground at Bosvigo, near Treyew, in 1844, and at about this time the name of the club was changed to Truro Cricket Club. A number of clubs were formed in the 1820s and for the first time regular inter-club matches took place, as well as the matches within towns such as Over Thirties v Under Thirties and Married v Singles. By the 1850s the large Cornish land-owning families, such as the Fortescue family of Boconnoc and the Agar-Robartes of Lanhydrock began to encourage the game, and between 1858 and 1870 many of the best English players toured Cornwall with teams such as the \"All England Eleven\", \"North of England Eleven\" and the \"United Eleven of All England\". In 1859 Cornwall lost to the Gentlemen of Devon and matches continued for a few years but were stopped following heavy Cornish defeats; Cornwall did beat Devon by an innings and 29 runs in 1887. Compared with other places, the lack of public schools seems to have held back the development of cricket, but by 1900 there were over one hundred and sixty clubs in Cornwall.\nOrigin and history of CCC.\nThe present Cornwall CCC was founded on 11 November 1894 at a meeting presided by Lord Robartes at the Talbot Hotel, Lostwithiel. Fifteen affiliated clubs and 114 subscribers contributed £151 6s 0d towards the new club. The first match was played against Devon on 22–23 July 1895 and they first competed in the Minor Counties Championship in 1904, appearing every year since with the exception of 1920. Cornwall won the Minor Counties Championship for the first time in their history in 2012, beating Buckinghamshire in the final. In 2015 Cornwall won the Unicorn Knockout Trophy beating Northumberland by 7 wickets at Sir Paul Getty's Ground, Wormsley, Buckinghamshire.\nHonours.\nNotable players.\nThe following Cornwall cricketers have played in the first-class game:"

It represents the historic county of Berkshire.\nThe team is currently a member of the National Counties Championship Western Division and plays in the NCCA Knockout Trophy. Berkshire played List A matches occasionally until 2005 but is not classified as a List A team \"per se\".\nHistory.\nAccording to Rowland Bowen in his \"Growth and Development of Cricket\", the first reference to cricket being played in the county of Berkshire was in 1751. Cricket certainly reached Berkshire much earlier than that for it originated on the Weald in Saxon or Norman times and was definitely being played in Berkshire's neighbouring county of Surrey in 1550.\nThe first definite mention of cricket in Berkshire relates to the famous all rounder Thomas Waymark who resided at Bray Wick, near Maidenhead in the 1740s, though there are earlier mentions of the game at Eton College. The first definite mention of cricket in Berkshire relates to a team called \"Buckinghamshire, Berkshire &amp; Hertfordshire\" in September 1740, which played two matches against London Cricket Club at Uxbridge and the Artillery Ground. London won the first \"with great difficulty\" but no post-match report was found of the second. See H. T. Waghorn: \"Cricket Scores 1730–73\".\nBy the late 18th century, Berkshire had achieved first-class status. Its strength was in the prominent Old Field Club of Bray, near Maidenhead, which had a team representative of Berkshire as a county and was capable of taking on other leading teams of the time. The first time Berkshire is recorded as a county team is in a match against Surrey in June 1769 and the county was top-class from then until August 1795 when, after losing to MCC at Lord's, it abruptly ceased to appear in first-class matches.\nClub origins.\nThe Oldfield Club was effectively a Berkshire county team but it was not formally constituted as a county club. Rowland Bowen's researches discovered evidence of a county organisation by 1841, but it may only have been a loose association of local clubs, as was sometimes the case elsewhere.\nBerkshire CCC was founded on 17 March 1895, the same year that the Minor Counties Championship began. It did not compete in the first year of the competition but joined for 1896.\nNotable players.\nInternational.\nThis list includes those Berkshire players who have played in Test cricket since 1877, One Day International cricket since 1971, or a Twenty20 International since 2004.\nEngland \nNetherlands \nSouth Africa \nWest Indies "

Wiltshire played List A matches occasionally from 1964 until 2005 but is not classified as a List A team \"per se\".\nThe club is a member of Wiltshire Cricket Limited, the governing body for cricket in the county.\nVenues.\nThe club is peripatetic, playing its matches around the county at:\nEarliest cricket.\nCricket probably reached Wiltshire by the end of the 17th century. The earliest known reference to cricket in the county is dated 1769.\nJohn Major points out that \"cricket did not spread evenly across whole counties\" but had a tendency towards \"local adoption\". He mentions a match at Stockton, Wiltshire in 1799 which was reported as \"an event so novel in the county of Wiltshire\". But cricket was being played by then at several other venues in the county including Calne, Devizes, Marlborough, Salisbury and Westbury.\nOrigin of club.\nA county organisation was formed on 24 February 1881. The present Wiltshire CCC was founded in January 1893, and joined the Minor Counties Championship for the 1897 season, competing every season since then.\nHistory.\nWiltshire has won the Minor Counties Championship twice, in 1902 and 1909. The Edwardian years were the club's \"most successful period\" and a 1903 report described the team as \"the equal of any first-class county\". Wiltshire's original captain, until 1920, was Audley Miller, also of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), who had played a Test match for England in South Africa in 1895–96.\nMiller was succeeded as captain by Robert Awdry, who had played first-class cricket for Oxford University through 1902–04. Awdry led the side until 1934 and the next captain from 1935 to 1939 was William Lovell-Hewitt, who made 3 first-class appearances for the Minor Counties through 1938–39.\nThe team experienced some lean seasons after the Second World War but improved during the 1950s under the captaincy of James Hurn. The best players at this time were opening batsman John Thompson, formerly of Warwickshire, who played regularly for Wiltshire from 1955 to 1958; and seamer Anthony Marshall, who played occasionally for Kent and was a Wiltshire stalwart from 1955 to 1970.\nDavid Richards, who played for Wiltshire from 1949 to 1965 was captain in the last three years of his career and the team were championship runners-up in both 1963 and 1964. Long-serving batsman Ian Lomax, who played for Wiltshire from 1950 to 1970, captained the side in the mid-sixties and played first-class for Somerset and MCC. He was succeeded in 1968 by Brian White, who served the county even longer, for 28 seasons from 1964 to 1991. White relinquished the captaincy after the 1980 season.\nAll-rounder Richard Gulliver succeeded White and was captain until he retired in 1983. In Gulliver's last season, Wiltshire lost the Minor Counties Championship in the final match when they were beaten by Dorset and that enabled Oxfordshire to \"pip them at the post\".\nWiltshire has never won the MCCA Knockout Trophy since its inception in 1983. The team was the beaten finalist in 1993, losing to Staffordshire by 69 runs; and in 2005, losing to Norfolk by 6 wickets. Wiltshire has reached the semi-finals on four other occasions.\nWiltshire has played numerous matches against first-class opponents, including touring teams, but none of these matches have themselves been classified as first-class. The team has played in several List A matches since 1964, all of them in the various incarnations of the ECB's limited overs knockout tournament. Wiltshire's best performance in these matches was a victory over Scotland by 7 wickets in 2000, but Wiltshire has never beaten a first-class team.\nNotable players.\nThe following Wiltshire cricketers also played with distinction in first-class cricket:"

In the latter year, according to Tony Percival, a club at Atcham was advertising to play county matches against teams from neighbouring counties but seemingly attracted little interest. The next revival occurred in 1844 when, following a letter from Shrewsbury solicitor G.M. Salt to \"Bell's Life in London\" asking for teams from neighbouring English counties or Wales to play Shropshire, Worcestershire played two matches both won by Shropshire.

The club play at Carlisle (Edenside Ground), Workington and Penrith from Cumberland as well as Westmorland's former grounds in Kendal (Netherfield Cricket Club Ground) and Barrow-in-Furness, the latter originally Lancashire.\nHistory.\nCricket probably reached Cumberland and Westmorland during the 18th century. The earliest references to cricket in the region are in 1827 (Westmorland) and 1828 (Cumberland). According to Rowland Bowen's research, there was reportedly an informal county club in Westmorland about 1835. It is known that a county organisation was established on 2 January 1884.\nThe club formed on 10 April 1948 and has been renamed twice:\nNotable players.\nThe following Cumberland cricketers also made an impact on the first-class game:"

        "title": "Buckinghamshire County Cricket Club",
        "text": "Buckinghamshire County Cricket Club is one of twenty minor county clubs within the domestic cricket structure of England and Wales. It represents the historic county of Buckinghamshire.\nThe team is currently a member of the Minor Counties Championship Eastern Division and plays in the MCCA Knockout Trophy. Buckinghamshire played List A matches occasionally from 1965 until 2005 but is not classified as a List A team \"per se\".\nThe club has its administrative headquarters at Little Chalfont and plays its matches around the county at various locations including at Wormsley on the Getty Estate. Until 1979 it played regularly at Ascott Park, the home of the Rothschild family which was prominent in the club's foundation.\nEarliest cricket.\nA match in October 1730 on Datchet Heath (now known as Datchet Common), outside the village of Datchet near Windsor, is the first reference to cricket in Buckinghamshire. Datchet is nowadays in Berkshire but was historically part of Buckinghamshire.\nIn September 1740, a team called \"Buckinghamshire, Berkshire &amp; Hertfordshire\" played two matches against the famous London Cricket Club at Uxbridge and the Artillery Ground. London won the first \"with great difficulty\" but no post-match report was found of the second.\nIn 1759, an All-England team that played three matches against the noted Dartford Cricket Club included a wicketkeeper called Gill from Buckinghamshire. The same player almost certainly featured in another All-England team in 1772.\nA number of games involving Buckinghamshire teams are mentioned in newspapers of the late 18th century. Unlike neighbouring Berkshire, Buckinghamshire was never considered a first-class county.\nOrigin of club.\nThe present Buckinghamshire CCC was founded on 15 January 1891 as \"Bucks County Cricket Club\" with the Rothschild family prominent in its formation. Family member Anthony Gustav de Rothschild even represented the club.\nClub history.\nBuckinghamshire joined the Minor Counties Championship in the competition's second season, 1896. Buckinghamshire declined an invitation to join the first-class County Championship in 1921 because of the lack of first-class facilities in the county. Buckinghamshire has won the Championship outright ten times (1922, 1923, 1925, 1932, 1938, 1952, 1969, 1987, 2009 and 2023) and shared the title in 1899 with Northamptonshire. In 2006, they won the Eastern Division, but lost in the final to Devon. Buckinghamshire has won the MCCA Knockout Trophy once since its inception in 1983, in 1990, defeating Lincolnshire in the final at Lord's The most successful period for the county came under the captaincy of Walter Franklin, who led them to five Championships in the 1920s and 1930s.\nThe county first played List A cricket in the 1965 Gillette Cup against Middlesex. The county appeared in 32 List A matches from 1965 to 2005, winning eight and losing 24, the majority of which against first-class opponents. The county claimed a first-class scalp once, defeating Somerset in the 1987 NatWest Trophy. Buckinghamshire lost the right to play List A cricket when the Minor counties were excluded from the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy from the 2006 season onward.\nNotable players.\nThe following Buckinghamshire cricketers also made an impact on the first-class game:\n1st XI Grounds.\nThe club have no fixed home, but play their matches at various grounds across the county. Grounds used for the 2011 season included:"

        "title": "Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball",
        "text": "Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball is a Super NES baseball game that was released in 1994. The game has a Major League Baseball (MLB) license but not a Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) license, meaning that the game has real stadiums and real teams, but not real players (except Ken Griffey Jr.). The fictitious players have the same statistics as their real-world counterparts, and the game comes with a name-changing feature that allows players to change the athletes' names. Nintendo released a portable version of the game in 1997 for the Game Boy with real players and stats from the 1996 season. The gameplay is similar to its predecessors, though it is sometimes sluggish due to hardware restrictions. The SNES version came with a promotional Griffey collector's card packed inside. It is often rated by the public as one of the best baseball games of all time.\nGameplay.\nThe game was groundbreaking and had a long list of features for its time. The game featured statistics from the real-life MLB season, and also kept statistics for the team controlled by the user throughout a season, though all of the statistics of CPU-controlled teams remained unchanged. The team rosters are based on the 1993 MLB season, with stats included.\nNearly every team has its own venue, sometimes complete with unique features, including Dodger Stadium's \"slants\" by the outfield crowd (the outfield \"roof\"), Shea Stadium's minuscule center field crowd, and the large scoreboard in the right field of Comiskey Park. Due to cartridge space limitations, some stadiums could not be added, and in those cases a generic stadium with green or blue walls is used (this layout was mostly used for the concrete donuts such as Riverfront Stadium and Three Rivers Stadium, themselves noted for being generic). Some of the stadiums are particularly realistic; Fenway Park's trademark Green Monster is in the game, as is Joe Robbie Stadium's teal wall and Oriole Park at Camden Yards' trademark Warehouse in right field. The Cincinnati Reds have a blue outfield wall as opposed to their signature green wall at Riverfront Stadium.\nThe Kansas City Royals and Chicago White Sox are the only two teams to play night games at their respective ball parks. Kauffman Stadium features its signature water falls in the outfield and signature scoreboard in Center Field. Both Yankee Stadium and Tiger Stadium are almost identical except that Yankee Stadium has shorter right field bleachers and the ball can be hit out of the park while Tiger Stadium has an upper deck all the way around. Toronto's SkyDome hotel/restaurant are visible in play if a homerun heads to center field. Wrigley Field has its signature Ivy on the outfield wall but is missing the apartment houses in left and right field respectively and the manual operated scoreboard in center field. The Kingdome has its signature large right field wall as does the Metrodome.\nThe Philadelphia Phillies are the only team to play in the generic stadium with astroturf and the green outfield wall. The Colorado Rockies, San Francisco Giants, and the Oakland Athletics are the only teams to play in the generic stadium with natural grass and the green outfield wall. The Pittsburgh Pirates, St. Louis Cardinals, Houston Astros, Montreal Expos, and Cincinnati Reds are the only teams to play in the generic stadium with astroturf and have a blue outfield wall. The Atlanta Braves, Milwaukee Brewers, San Diego Padres, and California Angels are the only teams to play in a generic stadium with natural grass and a blue outfield wall.\nThe Chicago White Sox wear their black alternate top as their home uniform in the game. The Los Angeles Dodgers have a player on the bench, Lou Graves (actually Darryl Strawberry), who is known for timely home runs in clutch situations; he is often substituted in at shortstop.\nPitching is one of the simplest elements in this game. There is also a battery-backed season mode, where players can select a team to play for 26, 78, or all 162 games. Players who finish first in their division earn a playoff berth and a chance to play in the World Series. Unique to the game was the ability to choose playing a season using a system of either four or six divisions, as the game was released after the six division system was proposed for MLB, but before the first MLB season with six divisions (1994).\nThe game also features the five new logos and uniforms designs of the Houston Astros, Milwaukee Brewers, San Francisco Giants, Texas Rangers, and the Detroit Tigers compared to what they looked like in 1993. The game also features the new ballparks The Ballpark in Arlington (home ballpark of the Rangers), and Jacobs Field (home ballpark of the Cleveland Indians), which replaced Arlington Stadium and Cleveland Stadium, respectively.\nFeatures.\nFictitious players in the game are themed with their teammates. Some of the themes include:\nAt the end of every game, the game provides box scores and scoring summaries in newspaper format, providing a humorous newspaper headline on other goings-on in the world of Major League Baseball.\nThe game has several other features, including a home run derby in which players practice their power hitting against either Ken Griffey Jr. or against one of five fictitious power batters - Warren Track, Barny Tater, Sammy Scrap, Can O' Corn and Nick Noheart.\nThe game features the voice of former MLB umpire Steve Palermo for called strikes, balls and outs.\nThe game's other vocal soundbite, that of a batter turning to the umpire and screaming \"Oh come on!\" after a called strike three was sampled from a Jim Belushi line in the 1985 movie \"The Man With One Red Shoe\".\nBugs.\nDue to a bug, during a full season some home run totals for players reset to zero after the All-Star game. A Nintendo Customer Service representative acknowledged this bug, further claimed that sometimes during the World Series players are prevented from using their best pitchers, and bluntly summarized, \"\"Ken Griffey Jr. Baseball\" sports some pretty serious bugs.\"\nSaved information, such as edited player names or seasons, are known to erase unexpectedly.\nGame Boy version.\nThe game was released in 1997 for the Game Boy, with Super Game Boy capabilities. Due to cartridge space, there is only one stadium. Unlike its predecessor, the Game Boy port's players have stats from the 1996 season, but they play in the 1997 season. It also has both a Major League Baseball and a Major League Baseball Players Association license- a first for a Ken Griffey Jr. game on a Nintendo console. The home run derby in this version is also free of the six player limit, so gamers can select any non-pitcher MLB player. 1997 Rookies of the Year Scott Rolen and Nomar Garciaparra debut in this game, along with Deivi Cruz.\nThe Game Boy and Game Boy Color versions of the game were developed by programmer Brian Beuken, who was working freelance for Software Creations at the time.\nReception.\n\"Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball\" received generally mixed reviews. \"GamePro\" heavily criticized the game's lack of realism, citing the fictitious players, inaccurate ballparks, inability to adjust defense, \"stylized\" player sprites, and the ability to control the ball even after it leaves the pitcher's hand. However, they acknowledged the game has good music, \"one of the best manuals for a baseball game\", and gameplay that is very accessible to beginners. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" criticized that the computer is too difficult to beat in one-player mode, but praised the digitized voices of Steve Palermo and Jack Buck and the general playability. They scored the game a 6.6 out of 10. In 2018, Complex ranked the game 91st in their \"The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time\".\nBy July 1994, the game sold 750,000 copies. The game ultimately sold 1.2 million units.\nLegacy.\nNintendo later published three more games featuring Ken Griffey Jr., one developed by Rare and two developed by Angel Studios."

        "title": "The Stars' Tennis Balls",
        "text": "The Stars' Tennis Balls is a psychological thriller novel by Stephen Fry, first published in 2000. In the United States, the title was changed to Revenge. The story is a modern adaptation of Alexandre Dumas's 1844 novel \"The Count of Monte Cristo\", which was in turn based on a contemporary legend.\nThe original title comes from a quotation taken from John Webster's \"The Duchess of Malfi\", which reads: \"We are merely the stars' tennis balls, struck and bandied which way please them.\"\nPlot summary.\nIn 1980, Ned (Edward) Maddstone is a seventeen-year-old student, the sort of person for whom everything goes right. He is head boy, talented at sports, and following in the footsteps of his father towards Oxford University and a career in politics. A school friend, Ashley Barson-Garland, discovers that Maddstone read part of his diary and knows that Ashley is ashamed of his working-class roots. Barson-Garland plots to tarnish Maddstone's character with an arrest for drug possession. He enlists Rufus Cade, who is jealous of Maddstone's good looks and popularity, and Gordon Fendeman, the Jewish-American cousin of Portia, the object of Maddstone's affection with whom Fendeman is also in love (Fendeman also agrees with Portia's non-practising Jewish parents that she should not marry outside the faith).\nWhen Maddstone is arrested, an envelope from his dying sailing instructor is discovered in his pocket. It is a coded message from the Irish Republican Army. Maddstone is whisked away from the police station by a smooth Secret Services operative called Oliver Delft, who listens calmly to Maddstone's explanation of events until he learns that the envelope was to be delivered to the home of Delft's mother. Wanting to cover-up his hidden familial relationship to a Fenian traitor, Delft decides that Maddstone must disappear. Maddstone is beaten up, pumped full of drugs, and taken away to a remote lunatic asylum off the coast of Sweden. For years he is programmed by the resident psychiatrist, Dr. Mallo, to believe that his memories of his former life are delusional. After several years, Maddstone starts to believe Mallo's mental programming. Mallo deems him \"well enough\" to fraternise with other inmates, and Maddstone begins to talk to Babe, a fellow Englishman. Babe informs Maddstone that he has not been in the asylum for three or four years as he believed, but he has in fact been there a whole decade. Maddstone is in shock, but he and Babe subsequently talk every day.\nThe two men become close friends. Over the course of another decade, Babe educates Maddstone, helping him to master chess and teaching him to speak multiple languages, among other things. Eventually Maddstone breaks Mallo's programming completely and regains his memory. With Babe's help, he determines who betrayed him and how, although he is still baffled by their motives. When Ned mentions the name of Oliver Delft, Babe, who has eidetic memory, remembers a list of IRA sympathisers that he once saw, which gives Ned another clue to the conspiracy. Several weeks later, Babe dies of a heart attack. He leaves Maddstone instructions detailing how to escape by hiding in Babe's coffin. Once free, he trades some prescription drugs (stolen from the asylum) to a dealer in Hamburg in exchange for a German passport. Following Babe's instructions, Ned travels to a Swiss bank. He gains access to Babe's account, in which Babe had deposited large sums of stolen money. The money has been accruing interest during Babe's imprisonment; the balance is over £324 million.\nNow fabulously wealthy, Ned assumes the identity of Simon Cotter, a famous and mysterious Internet entrepreneur who makes huge profits investing in high-risk ventures. He returns to England to begin his revenge. He arranges for the thugs who beat him, now in prison themselves, to be beaten, humiliated and robbed of all privilege and power. Albert Fendeman, the seventeen-year-old son of Gordon and Portia, starts to work for Cotter, and becomes a personal acquaintance.\nMaddstone targets Rufus Cade, survivor of several failed marriages and a regular drugs user. Due to Ned's intervention, Cade mistakenly sells sherbet instead of cocaine to a group of Turkish drug dealers. Moments after Ned reveals his true identity to Cade and his intent to destroy him, Cade is brutally mutilated by the dealers. Maddstone allows him to bleed to death over the course of an hour.\nAshley Barson-Garland is now a backbench Member of Parliament, a rising star in the Conservative Party known for his vocal stance on Internet censorship and the preservation of family values. On a broadcast of Barson-Garland's television programme, \"Threat of the Net\", Maddstone's ally, a young woman who facilitated his Hamburg drug deal, reveals evidence that Barson-Garland is deeply involved in child pornography. Fleeing the television studio during the show, Barson-Garland receives a trojan worm from Maddstone that reveals Ned's true identity and intent as it floods his hard drive with pornographic videos of under-age boys. As the police arrive, Barson-Garland kills himself.\nOliver Delft, no longer with the Intelligence Service, accepts a job from Cotter. Maddstone secretly reveals his identity to Delft's mother, who is paralysed and mute due to a stroke, and describes what he suffered on her account and his intent to utterly destroy her son. Maddstone believes she will be tortured by being unable to warn her son, but instead (although he does not know) she is ecstatic that her son is going to suffer for the years of torment he put her through after discovering her secret.\nMaddstone discovers that Gordon Fendeman was involved in a swindle in South Africa five years previously, that left an entire African tribe homeless, landless, and mired in poverty and starvation. Cotter reveals this information to the press. Albert, angered by this personal attack on his father, attempts to discredit Cotter. While showing Portia a mocking website he has made about Cotter, Albert unknowingly reveals Cotter's true identity to her. Maddstone replies to Albert's attack on him by infecting his computer with a virus. Portia visits Maddstone in his office and convinces him to make peace with Albert.\nGordon Fendeman is offered a deal by his board of directors that will allow him to resign without disgrace. Cotter, having become the chairman of the board just that morning, attends the meeting with the princess of the tribe that Fendeman double-crossed in Africa. The princess relays the tribe's view of events, and claims that when she was thirteen Fendeman raped her. Fendeman tries to kill himself, but dies of a heart attack on the boardroom floor.\nMaddstone has Delft beaten, and threatens to have him drugged, and flown to the asylum in Sweden. He offers Delft a choice: he can spend the rest of his life in the asylum, or commit suicide by swallowing hot coals. Delft chooses the latter and dies a gruesome death. Maddstone shoots the men who served as Delft's lackeys on the day that he was arrested, completing his revenge.\nMaddstone goes to the Fendeman house hoping to resume his relationship with Portia, but finds only Portia's father, who informs Maddstone that Portia and Albert have fled to an unknown location to mourn Gordon. Left on the kitchen table are the love letters that Portia and Maddstone exchanged as teenagers. Maddstone takes them, realizing that he will never find Portia and Albert.\nMaddstone tears up the love letters and scatters them at sea. He returns to what he now realises is his only real \"home\": the asylum, which he now owns.\nCharacter allusions/references.\nIn the novel's afterword, Fry states he tried to make his novel appear more of a conscious homage by changing the characters' names to anagrams or references to Dumas' original work:\nReception.\nReviews of the book were positive. Jane Shilling declared in \"The Times\" \"This is an odd, interesting, ambitious book with a complex pedigree\" and Harry Mount wrote of Fry in the Daily Telegraph \"He seems to be concentrating more on producing a taut thriller. This he does to good effect, adding a talent for terror and suspense-writing to his quiverful of skills\". However, Stephen Moss, writing in the Guardian opined that it was a \"good read rather than great book, pacy, well constructed and rather gruesome. If one were to make a criticism, one might say that it was a trifle banausian. It works like clockwork, but one does not buy a novel to tell the time.\""

        "title": "Carlos Alvarez (American football)",
        "text": "Carlos Alvarez Vazquez Rodriguez Ubieta (born April 1, 1950) is a former American football college player who was a consensus All-American wide receiver for the Florida Gators football team of the University of Florida from 1969 to 1971.\nEarly life.\nAlvarez was born in Cuba in 1950, the youngest of Licinio and Isola Alvarez's three sons. Alvarez's father Licinio had been a successful lawyer in Cuba, but his parents fled to the United States to escape Fidel Castro's communist revolution in 1960, when Alvarez was a 10-year-old boy.\nHe was raised in Miami, Florida and attended North Miami Senior High School in North Miami, Florida, where he was an all-county high school football player for the North Miami Pioneers. Alvarez was the Pioneers' star halfback who could run and catch, and was touted by the local newspapers as the best back in Dade County—on offense and defense. On at least two occasions, he played all forty-eight minutes of a high school game, playing on both offense and defense.\nHe was highly recruited by multiple universities, including the hometown University of Miami and the University of Florida, but he ultimately chose Florida where his older brothers Arturo and Cesar were already enrolled. It was reported that his brother Arturo was the best athlete in the family and could cover Carlos one-on-one. Alvarez graduated from North Miami High School in 1968.\nCollege career.\nAfter graduating from high school, Alvarez accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, and played for coach Ray Graves and coach Doug Dickey's Florida Gators football teams from 1969 to 1971. During Graves' final season as Florida's head coach in 1969, Alvarez was one of several talented second-year Gators known as the \"Super Sophs\" who led the team to its then all-time best record of 9–1–1. At the close of his sophomore season, he was honored as a first-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) selection and a consensus first-team All-American, and he caught a nine-yard touchdown pass to provide the Gators' margin of victory in their 14–13 upset of the Tennessee Volunteers in the 1969 Gator Bowl.\nAlvarez was known for his speed on the football field, and the media dubbed him the \"Cuban Comet.\" He was also the Gators' leading receiver in 1970 and 1971, marking three straight seasons as the Gators' top offensive weapon. Alvarez was also a first-team Academic All-American in 1969 and a second-team Academic All-American in 1970 and 1971, and was chosen for the Academic All-American Hall of Fame in 1991.\nIn the last game of that 1969 season against the University of Miami he heard a popping sound in his right knee, which would be the start of a series of injuries. In 1970, he was limited with a balky right knee that tended to swell at the slightest irritation and was thought of having an arthritic condition. He was able to come back in 1971, but played sparingly, although against the University of Maryland, he had 10 receptions for 134 yards, including a spectacular 16-yard touchdown, helping the Gators win 27–23. In 1972, he did graduate work in law. On January 9, he saw part-time action in the American Bowl. Two days later, he had surgery on his left knee (which he had previously injured as a junior in high school). Three days later, the apartment he shared with his brother was destroyed by fire.\nFlorida Gators receiving records.\nAlthough Florida has fielded many prolific offenses including 17 All-American receivers and three Heisman Trophy-winning quarterbacks since Carlos Alvarez last played in 1971, he is still the Gators' record holder for pass receptions in a single game (15), in a single season (88), and career receiving yards (2,563)/ At the end of his three-year college career, Alvarez held many Gator and SEC pass receiving records, including career, season and game pass receptions and yardage records.\nThe only SEC player in the last 50 years to hold at time of graduation all but one SEC career, season, and game record. Only record not held was career receiving touchdowns – held by College Football Hall of Famer Terry Beasley, Auburn. Only Gator receiver in the last 50 years to hold all Gator career, season and game pass receiving records at time of graduation. Alvarez still holds some individual game, season and career records and is in the top five of almost all other Gator receiving categories. The 88 catches in 1969 had been exceeded up to that season by only three players in the history of college football (Howard Twilley -Tulsa, Glen Meltzer – Wichita State, Jerry Hendren – Idaho). The 88 catches and 1329 yards in his sophomore season remain 50 years later the highest numbers by any sophomore player in SEC history. This was done in a 10-game season. Was in the top 5 in the SEC for season receiving yards in 1969 (1), 1970 (5) and 1971 (4) despite severe knee injuries in 70 and 71 and a coaching change that led to a more run oriented offense. At the time in 1969, first consensus All-American sophomore since Heisman Trophy winner Doak Walker (SMU) in 1947. One of only two Gator players (Danny Wurfell is the other) to be inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame and the Academic All-American Hall of Fame. The Gators have produced 17 All-Americans at the wide receiver position and two Heisman Trophy winning quarterbacks (Steve Spurrier played before Alvarez) since Alvarez’ graduation in 1972.\nHis career record of 176 receptions was broken by Andre Caldwell in 2007, and he ranks second in Gator history (and third in SEC history) in receiving yards in a single season (1,329 yards in 1969) and second on the receiving yards charts in a single game (237 against Miami in 1969). He ranks ninth among all-time Gators receivers in career touchdown receptions (26), seventh in touchdown receptions in a single season (18), and is tied for third for most touchdown receptions in a single game (3). His 133 yards per-game average in 1969 is still the all-time single-season best among Gators, and has only been exceeded once in the SEC.\nAlvarez ranks second among Gators receivers with thirteen games for 100 yards or more receiving, one behind career leader Jabar Gaffney. He ranks first among Gators for most 100-yard receiving games in a season, also tied with Gaffney and Travis McGriff, all with eight. Alvarez achieved this in 1969 when six of those 100-yard games were achieved consecutively—also a team record he shares with two other Gators.\nLife after football.\nAlvarez graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor's degree in political science, with honors, in 1972. The Dallas Cowboys selected him in the fifteenth round (390th overall pick) of the 1972 NFL Draft, hoping he could return to health, but he did not sign a contract because of his chronic knee injuries. He received an NCAA Post-Graduate Scholarship Award to attend the Duke University School of Law in Durham, North Carolina, and earned his juris doctor (J.D.) degree \"summa cum laude\" in 1975. After graduation, he worked as a law professor at the Southern Methodist University School of Law in Dallas, Texas, where he was named the Outstanding Law Professor in 1980.\nFollowing in the family legal tradition of his father and older brothers, Alvarez became a practicing attorney. He is a member of The Florida Bar, and has been admitted to practice before the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, and the U.S. Court of Claims. He has served on the Florida Elections Commission and Second Judicial Circuit Nominating Commission, and was awarded the Jose Marti Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Cuban Community from the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Alvarez is an environmental and land use attorney based in Tallahassee, Florida, but his current practice emphasizes mediation, arbitration and alternative dispute resolution.\nAlvarez was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a \"Gator Great\" in 1986, and elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2011. In one of a series of articles written in 2006, \"The Gainesville Sun\" recognized him as No. 7 among the top 100 all-time Gators football players from the first 100 years of the team.\nIn October 2020, ESPN SEC Storied series broadcast a documentary on Carlos Alvarez titled, \"The All-American Cuban Comet\". It was directed and produced by Gaspar Gonzalez. It covers approximately the first 22 years of Alvarez' life and his desire to become an American citizen after leaving Cuba at the age of 10 and how football became part of that struggle. It includes a perspective of that struggle during the socially turbulent times of the 60's and Alvarez' political activism during that time."

        "title": "Bowling pin",
        "text": "Bowling pins (historically also known as skittles or kegels) are the target of the bowling ball in various bowling games including tenpins, five-pins, duckpins and candlepins.\nTenpins.\nPin specifications are set by the United States Bowling Congress (USBC). World Bowling, formerly World Tenpin Bowling Association, has adopted the USBC specifications. Pins are tall, wide at their widest point, and weigh ±. The first British made tenpin was by H Massil and sons who received the permit no.1 from the British Tenpin Bowling Association (BTBA)\nThe USBC indicated that, effective August 1, 2023, it is certifying string pinsetters and string pin bowling as an independent category of equipment and competition separate from conventional free-fall pinsetters. USBC lab data indicated strike percentage on string pin bowling is 7.1% lower, causing the USBC to plan additional testing to determine whether a scoring conversion should be created between the categories. String pinsetters are less expensive and easier to maintain, motivating bowling centers to phase them in.\nDuckpins and fivepins.\nDuckpins are shorter and squatter than standard tenpins. Canadian fivepins are between duckpins and tenpins in size, but have a thick, inch-wide rubber band around the widest part of the pin to increase pin action when struck.\nCandlepins.\nCandlepins are dissimilar to the others, being the tallest of all at , but only wide and in weight, each pin nearly matching the maximum weight of a candlepin ball. They are nearly cylindrical in shape with a slight taper toward either end, making them vaguely resemble candles (hence the name). Unlike other bowling pins, because they are vertically symmetrical, candlepins may be set on either end. Due to their width and construction, candlepins tends to produce a billiard ball-like sound when struck.\nKegels.\nPins used in the German bowling game \"kegel\" appears to combine the design of tenpins and duckpins. The overall shape of the pin resembles a standard ten-pin bowling pins, and its small size is comparable to duckpins. Similar to five-pin bowling, these pins have strings attached on top of each, which connects them to the pinsetter.\nPin construction.\nBowling pins are constructed by gluing blocks of rock maple wood into the approximate shape, and then turning on a lathe. After the lathe shapes the pin, it is coated with a plastic material, painted, and covered with a glossy finish. Because of the scarcity of suitable wood, bowling pins can be made from approved synthetics. Currently there are synthetic pins sanctioned for play in five-pin, duckpin, and candlepin. There is one synthetic ten pin model approved by the USBC. When hit by the ball, synthetic pins usually sound different from wooden pins.\nJuggling clubs could be mistaken for bowling pins due to their similar shape. The two differ greatly in construction and weight."

        "title": "Tennessee–UConn women's basketball rivalry",
        "text": "The women's basketball rivalry between the Lady Volunteers of the University of Tennessee and the UConn Huskies of the University of Connecticut is one of the fiercest rivalries in college basketball, and could be considered one of the first to reach national consciousness out of the women's game. The matchup features two long-tenured and media savvy coaches generally acknowledged among the top five ever in their sport, over two dozen players who went on to play in the WNBA, and two programs that have combined for 19 national championships. Their head-to-head matchups were consistently the top-rated games in the college women's field. \nUntil the 2006-07 season, the two programs met annually in winter at one or both of the schools, but the rivalry is unique for having a third of its games occurring in the women's NCAA tournament. Four times, the national championship has been on the line.\nThe schools started playing each other in 1995. UConn leads the series 16-9, including 5-2 in the tournament and 4-0 for the title. On the day of every meeting during the rivalry series, both schools have ranked in the top 25 of the Associated Press rankings, until 2023 when Tennessee was not ranked for the first time in the series. \nIn AP Poll history, Tennessee and UConn have the two longest appearance streaks in women's college basketball. Tennessee had a 565-week run spanning 32 years and UConn currently has a more than 500-week run covering almost 30 years. In addition, UConn has the most No. 1 appearances with 246 with Tennessee in second at 112.\nThe two schools halted the regular-season series after the 2006-2007 season, and didn't play again for 13 years. The next season, both teams made the 2008 Final Four, but Stanford defeated UConn in the semifinals. Tennessee won the championship.\nIn 2018, a home and home series was announced with the next meeting at UConn on January 23, 2020. Thirteen years after the series halted, UConn beat Tennessee in the rivalry rematch, 60-45.\nAccomplishments by the two rivals.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs.\nThe coaches.\nIn its heyday, the rivalry was notable among team sports in that it almost unerringly focused on the sidelines rather than the floor. The two coaches were far and away the best known and best paid in their sport, with both being in the Basketball Hall of Fame and Women's Basketball Hall of Fame. Between them, they account for over 2,000 wins.\nOn the Tennessee side was Pat Summitt, the all-time winningest NCAA Division I college basketball coach, male or female. Summitt won eight NCAA women's tournaments. She was the acknowledged dean of women's college basketball in the modern era. She was the Naismith College Coach of the Year six times.\nOn the UConn side is Geno Auriemma, who has won eleven of the last twenty-four NCAA women's tournaments, four at the expense of Summitt in the finals. A media firebrand in the heart of ESPN country, Auriemma has become the most accomplished coach in the last decade, which included a record-breaking 111-game winning streak which began in the fall of 2014 and ended during the Final Four of 2017 NCAA women's tournament. He has seven Naismith awards to Summitt's six.\nThe two poured gasoline on the fire in press conferences, with Auriemma at one point calling Tennessee the \"Evil Empire\". The two apparently mended fences after some sparring, as Auriemma noted in his autobiography, \"Geno.\"\nThe games.\nThe two schools first met on January 16, 1995, when televised women's basketball was a rarity. At this high point, with dominant players such as Rebecca Lobo, Kara Wolters and Jennifer Rizzotti, UConn's program was on the rise, beating Tennessee during the regular season and again for the title and an undefeated regular season. They would win another rivalry game in 1996.\nThe next three years belonged to Summitt, as the Lady Vols won four of the next five meetings with the Huskies en route to three straight national championships. The \"Meeks\"—Chamique Holdsclaw, Semeka Randall, and Tamika Catchings—and point guard Michelle M. Marciniak powered Tennessee past all rivals, including UConn.\nOn the horizon, though, were Auriemma's most dominant classes yet, and possibly the strongest lineup ever in the women's game. The starting five of Sue Bird, Asjha Jones, Swin Cash, Tamika Williams, and (for the latter part of the run) Diana Taurasi gave UConn four of the next five national championships. In that run of 2000 to 2004, UConn crushed Tennessee in the rivalry, winning nine of the next eleven meetings, including the 2000, 2003, and 2004 championship games.\nIn the three seasons after Taurasi went to the WNBA, Summitt rebounded with strong new players like Candace Parker, and won each meeting. UConn's program lacked a dominant scorer like Taurasi, and Tennessee made the most of this vulnerability.\nWith these results, the rivalry continues to be top-of-mind in the women's game, even years after its discontinuation. A matchup in the 2002 Final Four at the Alamodome in San Antonio was in front of the largest crowd in women's history (29,619). The 2006 regular-season game at Thompson–Boling Arena in Knoxville drew the largest crowd ever for a regular-season women's game (24,653).\nAfter the 2007 game, Auriemma noted that the rivalry, while still intense, lost some of its edge because of increasing parity in the women's game. As an illustration, 2006 was the first time since 1999 that neither UConn nor Tennessee had made the Final Four. He remarked, \"In some sense, a small sense, it's still the Red Sox and the Yankees. It still is. But there's still a lot more good things going on in college basketball now. That's just the reality of it.\"\nThirteen years after the series ended, the rivalry resumed in 2020, with UConn winning all 4 games through the 2023 season.\nOther sports.\nFootball.\nThe rivalry spread into other sports as the two schools agreed to play each other in other matchups. On September 4, 2008, UConn and Tennessee agreed to a home and home series in football for the 2015 and 2016 seasons, but in order for Tennessee to play Virginia Tech at Bristol Motor Speedway in 2016, the series has been postponed. Furthermore, because of UConn's \"Group of Five\" status while Tennessee was in the \"Power Five,\" future matchups are likely to be rare. The two ultimately faced off in Knoxville on November 4, 2023, with the Volunteers winning 59-3.\nMen's basketball.\nNearly a year later on July 22, 2009, Huskies men's basketball head coach Jim Calhoun and Vols men's basketball head coach Bruce Pearl agreed to a home and home basketball series in the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 seasons. Summitt's son Tyler was on the Volunteers' roster for both games, which the two schools split.\nDuring the 2012-13 season, Tyler Summitt joined Marquette's coaching staff for the women's team, the final year of the pre-split Big East. The Huskies won against the Golden Eagles in both games. The Summitt family's rivalry is now at Connecticut 16, Summitts 10—Pat was 9-13 during the rivalry, while Tyler was 1-1 at Tennessee against Connecticut as a men's basketball player, and 0-2 as Marquette's assistant coach."

        "title": "Speed skating at the Winter Olympics",
        "text": "Long track speed skating has been featured as a sport in the Winter Olympics since the first winter games in 1924. Women's events were added to the Olympic program for the first time in 1960 Squaw Valley Olympics.\nHistory.\nThe governing body for speed skating, the International Skating Union (ISU), was included in the list of recognized federations when the International Olympic Committee was founded, but was first discussed seriously for the 1908 Summer Olympics in London. No speed skating events were contested, although figure skating – also governed by the ISU – was on the programme. The preliminary calendar for the 1916 Summer Olympics, to be held in Berlin, listed a 3-event allround competition, but these Games were cancelled because of World War I.\nThe International Winter Sports Week in Chamonix, retro-actively dubbed the 1924 Winter Olympics, contained five speed skating events. Uncommon for the time, it not only included an all-round competition, but also awarded medals for the individual distances: 500 m, 1500 m, 5000 m and 10000 m. The all-round event was dropped before the 1928 Games, even though it remained the only World Championship format in the sport until the 1970s; single distance World Championships were not established until 1996.\nThe 1932 speed skating events were held according to the North American rules, meaning the skaters competed in small packs of skaters (the format paved the way for the development of short track speed skating), instead of the common against-the-clock format. These Games in Lake Placid, New York, also saw the first female speed skaters at the Olympics in a set of demonstration events, with all victories being achieved by North American athletes. Women's events were also set to be held at the 1940 Winter Olympics, which were cancelled. After the war, they were withdrawn again by the decision of the IOC until the 1960 Olympics in Squaw Valley, when the women skated 500 m, 1000 m, 1500 m and 3000 m.\nFollowing the introduction of World Sprint Championships in the early 1970s, the 1000 m for men was added in Innsbruck 1976, while the women's 5000 m, reinstated by the ISU as an official distance in 1981, made its Olympic debut in 1988. The latest addition to the Olympic speed skating programme is the team pursuit, which was added for the 2006 Turin Games. Its inclusion was remarkable as it had not yet been contested at a senior World Championship in the form skated at the Olympics at the time of inclusion. It had however been contested at a senior World Championship, the Dutch team won the 2005 title in Inzell, but in that form they only had to skate once and be the fastest, while the Olympic form required three starts.\nAt the 2010 Winter Olympics, Haralds Silovs became the first athlete in Olympic history to participate in both short track (1500m) and long track (5000m) speed skating, and the first to compete in two different disciplines on the same day.\nEvents.\nMen's.\nThe following table shows when events were contested at each Games. Women's events were demonstrated in 1932.\n• = \"official event\", (d) = \"demonstration event\"\nWomen's.\n• = \"official event\", (d) = \"demonstration event\"\nMedal table.\nSources (after the 2022 Winter Olympics):&lt;br&gt;\n\"Accurate as of 2022 Winter Olympics.\""

        "title": "Bill Cleary (ice hockey)",
        "text": "William John Cleary Jr. (born August 19, 1934) is an American former ice hockey player, coach, and athletic administrator. He is an alumnus of Belmont Hill School, played on the United States men's national ice hockey team that won the gold medal in ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics, and was inducted into the International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame in 1997.\nCareer.\nPlaying.\nCleary was an All-American hockey player at Harvard, starring for two years and setting several team records (many of which still stand) along the way, including most goals in a game (6), longest goal-scoring streak (15), most goals in a season (42) and most points in a single season (89). Cleary's scoring prowess was instrumental in Harvard's invitation to the 1955 NCAA Tournament, the first in school history, and Cleary was named to the All-Tournament First Team after Harvard's third-place finish.\nWhile at Harvard, Bill and his brother Bob played collegiate summer baseball together for the now defunct Sagamore Clouters of the Cape Cod Baseball League.\nTaking a year away from college, he won a silver medal as a member of the U.S. ice hockey team at the 1956 Winter Olympics, after turning down a professional-contract offer from the National Hockey League's Montreal Canadiens and Boston Bruins (Cleary opted to go into the insurance business instead and made more money than he probably would have in the NHL). At the 1959 World Ice Hockey Championships, he won the IIHF directorate award for best forward. At the 1960 Winter Olympics, in Squaw Valley, California, Bill and his brother Bob teamed up to win a gold medal with the U.S., with Bill leading the team in scoring through the tournament with 14 points.\nCoaching.\nAfter the 1960 Olympics Cleary retired as a player and became an ice hockey official for several years before returning to Harvard in 1968 to coach the freshman squad. Bill was quickly promoted to assistant coach of the varsity team and then became the head coach in 1971 when Cooney Weiland retired. Cleary's teams got off to a fast start with a top two finishing in each of his first four years. Though he couldn't manage to win a tournament in the time (conference or national) Cleary had established himself enough to carry through a down period in the late 1970s.\nHarvard missed the postseason each year from 1977 to 1981, ending with a losing record in four of those seasons. There was a slight recovery in 1981-82 when Harvard won its division and was able to use it to propel itself into the ECAC title game and receive a subsequent invitation to the 1982 NCAA Tournament despite its rather bland record. The next season saw return to prominence for the Crimson as they won the ECAC Tournament and made the team's first National Title game, losing 6–2 to Wisconsin. For the stark turnaround not only did Cleary receive the Spencer Penrose Award but Mark Fusco was awarded the Hobey Baker Award.\nAfter a brief dip in the standings for 1983-84, Harvard was a national contender for the remainder of the 1980s, winning at least 20 games each year from '85 to '89. Cleary won four consecutive ECAC regular season titles from '86 to '89 (one shared) and reached the National Championship for a second time in 1986, losing 6–5 to Michigan State. That season Cleary coached his second Hobey Baker winner, Scott Fusco, who remains the top career scorer in the history of the program. Three years later Harvard was once again in the title tilt, this time coming out on top with a 4–3 overtime win against Minnesota, garnering not only Harvard's first (and only) National Title, but their third Hobey Baker winner in Lane MacDonald (the team's all-time goal scoring leader).\nCleary coached the Crimson for one more season before moving on to become an administrator for Harvard's athletic department and formally retired on June 30, 2001.\nAwards and honors.\nAmong many of the honors he has received include being named to the NCAA Ice Hockey 50th Anniversary team, chosen as the US Hockey Player of the Decade (1956–1966), tabbed as one of the 100 Golden Olympians by the USOC as well as being named the 33rd-best Massachusetts athlete in the 20th century by Sports Illustrated and #68 on the Boston Globe's top 100 New England athletes of the 20th century. Additionally Cleary is the only person in the history of Harvard University's athletic department to have his jersey number (4) retired. Cleary's three Hobey Baker winners ties him for having coached the most players ever with Mike Sertich and Doug Woog.\nCleary was the driving force behind the structure of ECAC Hockey and a mentor to several successful college coaches, including 1987 CCHA Coach of the Year Val Belmonte. The Cleary Cup, named in his honor, is awarded to the ECAC's regular-season champion.\nCleary was Ryan O/Neal's stand-in for key ice hockey action scenes in the 1970 film, \"Love Story\", which was about a Harvard hockey player protagonist."

        "text": "Aaron Michael Miller (born August 11, 1971) is an American former professional ice hockey defenseman. Over the course of his 14-year career in the National Hockey League (NHL), which lasted from 1994 to 2008, Miller played for the Quebec Nordiques/Colorado Avalanche, the Los Angeles Kings and the Vancouver Canucks. In 2002, he was selected as a member of United States hockey team at the 2002 Winter Olympics, where he won a silver medal. Prior to making his professional debut, Miller earned a degree in business from the University of Vermont.\nEarly life.\nMiller was born and raised in Buffalo, New York, one of six children to Bill and Joan Miller. As a youth, he played in the 1984 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Buffalo. After playing forward at St. Francis High School and the Niagara Scenics in Buffalo, Miller was given a scholarship to the University of Vermont. Prior to attending the university, he was drafted 88th overall by the New York Rangers in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft. Miller was named team captain at the start of the 1992-93 season. He scored four goals and 13 assists in 30 games over the year, and was named to both the ECAC First All-Star Team and the NCAA East Second All-American Team. After four years at Vermont, he graduated with a degree in business. He finished his university career with 11 goals and 62 points in 122 games, later being named to Vermont's All-Time Men's Hockey Team, \"The ECAC Years\".\nProfessional career.\nQuebec Nordiques/Colorado Avalanche.\nThough he was drafted by the Rangers in 1989, Miller opted to go to university and complete his degree. It was while he was at university that Miller was traded by the Rangers. On January 17, 1991, he was sent to the Quebec Nordiques (along with the Rangers' fifth-round draft pick, used to select Bill Lindsay) in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft in exchange for Joe Cirella.\nAfter graduating from university, Miller made his professional debut in 1993 for the Nordiques minor league affiliate, the Cornwall Aces of the American Hockey League (AHL). On January 15, 1994, he made his NHL debut in Quebec against the Washington Capitals. Miller's first professional season ended with 1 NHL and 64 AHL games, where he scored four goals and ten assists. The next season, he appeared in nine games for the Nordiques, earning three assists. Miller also played 76 games for the Aces, finishing with totals of 4 goals and 22 points.\nOn June 21, 1995, the Quebec Nordiques transferred to Denver and became the Colorado Avalanche. Miller joined the team in Colorado and split the 1995–96 season between Colorado and Cornwall. In 62 games with Cornwall, he had 4 goals and 23 assists while going scoreless in five games with the Avalanche. Because he did not appear in enough games, Miller was not considered as part of the Stanley Cup-winning Avalanche team.\nThe 1996–97 season was Miller's first full season in the NHL. In a game against the Chicago Blackhawks on October 11, 1996, Miller scored his first NHL goal. He finished with 5 goals and 17 points while appearing in 56 games for the Avalanche, and his plus-minus was a +15, the best in the NHL for rookies. It also marked the Miller's Stanley Cup playoffs, where he registered 1 goal and 2 assists in 17 playoff games. The following season, he had 4 points in 55 games for the Avalanche, while going pointless in seven playoff games. Miller had his most productive season in 1998–99. After scoring a career-high 18 points in 76 games, Miller participated in 19 playoff games with a career-best five assists and six points. He would only play in 53 games the next season, but did suit up for every playoff game, scoring 1 goal and 1 assist in 17 games.\nAfter 56 games with the Avalanche during the 2000–01 season, where he had 13 points, Miller was traded for the second time in his career. On February 21, 2001, Miller was sent to the Los Angeles Kings alongside Adam Deadmarsh, a player later to be named (Jared Aulin, who would be traded on March 22, 2001) and Colorado's first-round draft picks in the 2001 (Dave Steckel) and 2003 (Brian Boyle) Entry Drafts in exchange for Rob Blake and Steven Reinprecht. Miller was not originally meant to be traded, but the Kings insisted he be part of the deal.\nLos Angeles Kings.\nMiller would finish the 2000–01 season with the Kings. In the final 13 games of the regular season, he had five assists, finishing with a career-best 14 assists and matching his career high of 18 points in one season. He contributed an assist in 13 playoff games as the Kings played the Avalanche, Miller's former team, who defeated Los Angeles as they went on to win the Stanley Cup for the second time.\nIn his first full season with the Kings, Miller played in 74 games for the team, scoring 5 goals and 12 assists during the 2001–02 season. At the conclusion of the regular season, Miller was named the winner of several Kings team awards: best defenseman, best defensive player and the teams unsung hero. During the playoffs, he went pointless while playing in all seven of the Kings' games. Abdominal surgery and a broken foot limited Miller to 49 games with the Kings the next season, recording one goal and five assists for six points.\nIn a game against the Atlanta Thrashers on December 10, 2003, Miller injured his neck. It would lead him to miss most of the 2003–04 season, appearing in 35 games and scoring one goal and two assists. The 2004–05 NHL lockout resulted in a cancelled 2004–05 season. Unlike many other players, Miller did not play in a different league. He returned to play for the 2005–06 season and earned eight assists in 56 games. For the first time in his career, Miller played in all 82 games during the 2006–07 season, again scoring eight assists.\nVancouver Canucks.\nAs an unrestricted free agent, Miller signed a one-year, $1.5 million contract with the Vancouver Canucks on July 9, 2007, ending his time with the Kings. On December 18, 2007, Miller scored a goal against Martin Brodeur of the New Jersey Devils, his first goal in 193 games, a span lasting over four years. The goal, the game-winner, marked the longest stretch of Miller's career between scoring goals. In a game on March 6 against the Nashville Predators, Miller injured his shoulder and ultimately missed the remainder of the season. Following the conclusion of the 2007–08 season, in which he had eight assists in addition to the goal, Miller retired from professional hockey.\nInternational play.\nDuring his playing career Miller represented the United States in several international tournaments. His first appearance was at the 1991 World Junior Championships. He scored a goal and an assist in eight games. Miller was also chosen to play in the 2002 Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City. In six games, Miller went pointless as the Americans won the silver medal, and experience he referred to as \"best part of [his] career.\" Two years later, he joined the bronze medal-winning American team at the 2004 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships. He contributed an assist in nine games. Later that year he participated in the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, and appeared in 5 games. Miller made a return to the World Championships in 2005, playing seven games and scoring two assists. He was named to the 2006 Olympic Winter Games in Turin, but pulled out due to back problems.\nPost-retirement.\nMiller resides in South Burlington, Vermont and is the owner of 11 Buffalo Wild Wings franchises with his business partner in Burlington; Concord, Manchester, and Nashua, New Hampshire; Southington, Waterbury, and Windsor, Connecticut; Chicopee, Massachusetts; and Plattsburgh, New York. He also provided color commentary for select Vermont Catamounts men's ice hockey radio broadcasts from 2009 to 2010 on AM 620, WVMT. In 2015 he was inducted into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame. He and his wife Kristy had three children: Grace, Ava, and Sullivan."

        "text": "A swimming gala is a swimming competition between clubs or groups of swimmers, usually of young people. This term is primarily used in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and South Africa. In Australia \"swimming carnival\" is the norm.\nOverview.\nIn the UK swimming galas are traditionally held at the end of the summer and through the autumn. Typical groups that compete at galas include schools, Girl Guides and Scouts other youth groups and between swimming clubs and between individual swimmers.\nAs well as the usual swimming events, there are sometimes more fun or unusual events such as swimming backwards or varieties of mixed relays and special races are often staged for the group leaders. This could also be extended to others as well as leaders many others will have a go at the race.\nSwimming galas serve several purposes including competition, fund raising and social bonding.\nThere are a variety of galas, some of which are listed here. League galas are a set of galas (often three) between different clubs where in each race points are awarded, and whichever club get the most points win and get promoted to the next division. County galas are for individual swimmers that have achieved the qualifying times and wish to compete at a county level. After these come regional galas which have the same concept as county galas but for bigger areas so they have faster qualifying times. The next stage up are national galas which are for the best swimmers in the country. Open galas are galas hosted by clubs/organizations to raise money. Other galas include club galas which include swimmers from the same club competing against each other and galas hosted purely for fun."

        "text": "Chris Clark (born March 8, 1976) is an American former professional ice hockey right winger who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Calgary Flames, Washington Capitals and Columbus Blue Jackets.\nIn 2019, he was named the general manager of the American Hockey League's Cleveland Monsters.\nPlaying career.\nCollege.\nClark played four years for the Clarkson Golden Knights in the ECAC (NCAA Division I), recording 128 points (63 goals and 65 assists) and 392 penalty minutes in 142 games. He was named to the ECAC Second All-Star team in 1998.\nProfessional.\nClark was drafted in the third round, 77th overall, by the Calgary Flames in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. He played five seasons with the Flames. In his final season with the team, he played in every game and helped the team to the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals, which they lost to the Tampa Bay Lightning.\nClark was traded to the Washington Capitals as a restricted free agent on August 4, 2005, in exchange for a conditional pick in the 2006 Entry Draft. He scored 20 goals and 19 assists (39 points) with the Capitals in his first season, playing alongside rookie Alexander Ovechkin. The Capitals named Clark their new team captain on September 13, 2006. Clark then set career-high numbers in goals (30), assists (24) and points (54) during the 2006–07 season, continuing to play alongside Ovechkin.\nClark was injured in the third period of a 2–1 shootout loss to the Florida Panthers on November 28, 2007, and missed the next 18 games with a strained groin muscle. He returned to the lineup on February 13, 2008, but played only one shift against the Philadelphia Flyers. Clark kicked out his skate in an attempt to stop a pass when he aggravated the groin injury. Clark missed the remainder of the regular season and playoffs.\nAfter suffering a wrist injury in February 2009, Clark required surgery which ended his 2008–09 season. He skated with the team during the pre-game skate before Game 5 of the 2009 Stanley Cup playoff game against the New York Rangers, but did not return until Game 7, taking the place of Donald Brashear, who was suspended for six games after his late hit on New York's Blair Betts.\nOn December 28, 2009, Clark (along with defenseman Milan Jurčina) was traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for winger Jason Chimera. Clark was the third-longest tenured captain in the history of the Washington Capitals, behind only Hockey Hall of Famer Rod Langway and Dale Hunter.\nDuring the 2011 off-season, Clark accepted a try-out invitation from the Boston Bruins. Despite having an impressive pre-season, he was released from the Bruins training camp on October 5, 2011, without a contract. On November 3, 2011, Clark signed a professional tryout agreement with the Providence Bruins, the American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate of the Boston Bruins. He was released by Providence on November 21, 2011, after six games, failing to record a point during his tryout period.\nRetirement.\nAfter he was released by Providence, Clark took up a scouting position with the Columbus Blue Jackets organization for the remainder of the 2011–12 season before being named the team's development coach. In 2019, the Blue Jackets named him the general manager of their American Hockey League affiliate, the Cleveland Monsters.\nInternational play.\nDuring the 2004–05 NHL lockout Clark continued his career in Europe. Clark first played through a short stint with Swiss team SC Bern, then with Norwegian outfit Storhamar Dragons.\nIn 2007, Clark was chosen as the captain of the United States national team for the 2007 IIHF World Championship, where he scored two goals and one assist in six games."

        "title": "List of Indianapolis 500 pole-sitters",
        "text": "The Indianapolis 500 (also called the Indianapolis 500-Mile Race) is an annual American open-wheel car race held on American Memorial Day weekend at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS), in Speedway, Indiana. It was first held in 1911 after the track's owners had experimented with several other long-distances auto races over the previous two years. The race was not held in 1917 or 1918 and again from 1942 to 1945 because of war. It was administered by the American Automobile Association between 1911 and 1955, then by the United States Auto Club from 1956 to 1997, and finally by the Indy Racing League/IndyCar beginning in 1998. The polesitter is the driver that has qualified for the event in pole position, at the inside of the front of the starting grid. Since 1989, the polesitter has received a $100,000 cash prize, and they and their car owner receive a small trophy at a ceremony that takes place after qualifying. The award is currently sponsored by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone; past sponsors include Anheuser-Busch through its Budweiser brand, PPG Industries, MBNA America Bank, WorldPoints Visa Card, AAMCO Transmissions, Peak Performance Motor Oil, and Verizon. Out of the 107 completed Indianapolis 500s (as of the 2023 race), the driver that has started in first place has gone on to win the race 21 times.\nThe qualifying speed format has been changed four times since the first race in 1911. The starting grid for the first race was determined by the date the IMS received entries, and all cars had to reach on a quarter-mile part of the main straight. This was adjusted to drivers averaging on the whole track in 1912, while the starting grid was still set by the order IMS received postal entries. A blind draw was conducted in both 1913 and 1914 once drivers reached the minimum speed. The qualifying format was revised in 1915 so that the grid was determined by drivers' speeds over a single lap, with a minimum speed of . From 1920 to 1932, drivers set the starting order by completing four-lap () qualifying runs at a set minimum speed between . From 1933 to 1938, it was a ten-lap () qualifying speed format with cars carrying of fuel. The four-lap speed format was reinstated in 1939, and the minimum speed requirement was dropped after 1963.\nQualifying is held on the Saturday (Bump Day) and Sunday (Pole Day) of the weekend preceding the event, whereas qualifying was formerly held over two weekends. There have been a number of different qualifying systems in the past; earlier, from 2005 to 2009, pole position through eleventh was determined on the first day of qualifying, with the rest of the grid order set over the next three days. Since 2010, drivers have competed in a knockout-style qualifying system and select qualifiers are awarded season points towards the IndyCar Series championship. The top twelve cars from the first day proceed to the second round the following day, and the top six drivers from that round advance to the third and final round, which determines the top six starting places, including pole position. Since 1965, a blind draw is held the night before to determine the qualifying order, and every car has been guaranteed at least one attempt to qualify in the pole position round, regardless if weather or other circumstances interfered since 1971. Previously, the qualifying order was set by teams presenting their cars in a queue beginning at the garage area. Warm-up laps were limited to three after World War II before dropping to two in 1982. Unlike other IndyCar events, each driver completes a four-lap qualifying run with no other cars on track across two days, and their average speed over each lap is used to determine their final starting position.\nA total of 66 drivers have won the pole position . Rick Mears holds the record for the most Indianapolis 500 pole positions, having qualified first on six occasions. Scott Dixon is second with five pole positions and Hélio Castroneves, A. J. Foyt, and Rex Mays are third with four poles. Eleven drivers have qualified in the pole position for two consecutive years, but no one has won in three years in a row. Mays and Cliff Bergere are the youngest and oldest Indianapolis 500 pole winners, qualifying on pole at the ages of 22 years, 81 days in 1935 and 49 years, and 175 days in 1946, respectively. Álex Palou and Gil Andersen set the fastest and slowest four-lap average pole speeds of in 2023 and in 1912, respectively.\nProcedure.\nSpeeds were recorded by the front wheels of cars travelling over a wire stretched across the circuit at the start/finish line an inch from the ground to activate the mechanism to record a lap time on a paper card before switching to using an electric eye in 1946. Since 1990, lap times and speeds have been recorded by electronic scoring devices or timing beacon wires embedded in certain places of the track (such as the start/finish line) and are activated by wireless transponders with a unique digital identification carried inside each car. They send digital timing information to a computer system via radio, which includes speed and lap time estimated to the thousandth of a second.\nAll drivers have been permitted two warm-up laps since 1982, down from three between 1946 and 1981. The decision to continue or abandon the effort had to be made before the second warm-up lap was completed. A qualifying attempt begins when a team representative waves a green flag. If they wave the yellow flag, the attempt will not count, and the driver must return to the pit lane. If the team did not display a green flag, a vehicle may leave the pit lane as many times as it wanted. Prior to 1974, drivers raised one of their hands in the air to signal to officials that they wanted to start their qualifying run before the change was made to be in line with the procedure conducted at other race circuits. Teams are allowed to modify certain parts or electronics on their cars in their pit box following the completion of their qualifying run.\nSince 1965, a blind draw conducted by a selected representative from each team (a driver, family member or team representative) has been held the night before qualifying to decide the qualifying order in order to reduce congestion or misunderstandings. All participants have been guaranteed at least one try to qualify in the pole position round, regardless of weather or other circumstances since 1971. Every driver does their qualifying run with no other car on the circuit and their average speed over all of their laps is used to determine their final starting place. The grid is arranged by 11 rows of three participants each for a total of 33 starting drivers.\n1911–2004.\nIn 1911, the starting order was determined by the date the IMS received entries, and all cars had to reach on a quarter-mile part of the main straight. This was adjusted to drivers averaging on the whole track in 1912, while the starting grid was still set by the order IMS received postal entries. A blind draw was conducted in both 1913 and 1914 once drivers reached the minimum speed. The qualifying format was revised in 1915 so that the grid was determined by drivers' one-lap speeds, with a minimum speed of . From 1920 to 1932, participants set the starting order by completing four-lap () qualifying runs at a set minimum speed between . From 1933 to 1938, it was a ten-lap () qualifying speed format with cars carrying of fuel. The four-lap speed format was reinstated in 1939, and the minimum speed requirement was dropped after 1963.\nThe draw is conducted on a \"first-come, first-served\" basis, with the fastest 33 drivers starting the race regardless of when they qualified. Previously, the qualifying order was set by teams presenting their cars in a queue that began in the garage area. The quickest qualifier on the first day or the top qualifier following a single trip through the original timing line took pole position, whichever came last. All cars were given three attempts to qualify and its speed was made official after completing four-laps () and cannot re-qualify. The driver could requalify in another vehicle if it did not qualify or withdrew. After 33 cars qualified, the slowest qualifier, regardless of position in the provisional starting order, could be demoted by a faster car. All successful qualifiers were assured participation in the race based on their qualifying time and speed. The first day's quickest qualifier took the pole position, while the first day qualifiers were followed by those from the previous two or three days through their set qualifying speed, respectively.\nIn 1996 and 1997, the top 25 cars in the Indy Racing League (IRL) points standings were guaranteed a starting position in the race with the final eight spots open for all other entries.\n2005–2009.\nIn order to boost interest, increase action, and attract more spectators, IMS officials changed the qualifying format to a four-session format known as \"11-11-11\" in 2005. On the first three days, 11 cars qualified, and bumping occurred on each day once position 11 was taken and within the allocated positions. Positions 11 to pole position were taken on the first day, positions 12 to 22 on the second, and positions 23 to 33 on the third. If the third day completed the starting order, the fourth and final day (Bump Day) permitted a participant that lapped faster than one that qualified in the previous three days to demote the slowest entrant from the starting order. It would take 33rd place or better if the driver went faster than any other Bump Day qualifier. Bumping would be widespread throughout the starting order under this format, rather than being restricted to the slowest vehicles. If the 11 starting slots on one day were not filled, they would be considered for the next day. Rain could not end a session early if all 33 spots were filled. If the field was not complete, the IRL and IMS decided the time teams would have for the next available day.\nAll cars, backup or primary, were given three attempts each day or twelve over all four days to qualify for the race. Any driver who set the same qualifying time and speed as a participant on the first day would be placed based on where they qualified on that day. If the time and speed are the slowest overall, the participant who set the time and speed on the second day will be the first to fail to qualify. If a vehicle failed to qualify on any qualifying day, it was allowed to return to the qualifying line and attempt to re-qualify based on how many attempts it had left. Entrants could still withdraw a qualified car if necessary, although it could still attempt to qualify based on the number of tries it had left for that day. Unlike previous formats, no car had to be withdrawn from the race. If a car was withdrawn from the event, the rest of the field would gain one position. This system, according to IMS historian Donald Davidson and author Rick Shaffer, offered the best drivers more chances to claim the pole position.\n2010–2013.\nIn 2010, a new \"made-for-TV\" two-day shootout format based loosely on the IndyCar Series' road and street course qualifying procedure was implemented. The format gradually decreased the field to determine the pole position starter. The first six-hour qualifying day filled the top 24 spots. All cars had three tries to set a qualifying speed, and positions 10 through 24 were set after the session. The quickest nine entrants' lap times and speeds were erased, and they all advanced to the 90-minute Fast Nine Shootout session, which determined pole position through ninth. They started from the fastest to the slowest, and each driver had to finish at least one more run with the option of another if time allowed.\nIf the Fast Nine Shootout was cancelled due to inclement weather, the starting order would be set by each driver's lap times from the previous session. The following day's session determined places 24 to 33, and bumping commenced when 33 cars qualified. Any qualifying speed quicker than a previously qualified car would mean that car was demoted from the starting grid, regardless of the day it qualified, and any car other than those that qualified for the Fast Nine Shootout risked not qualifying. The demoted entrant was withdrawn from the field but granted three attempts to return to the grid, time permitting, and the car that demoted it was put at the back of the starting grid. There would only be one day of qualifying if rain disrupted the first day. All 33 starting positions would be set and the Fast Nine Shootout would not happen.\nIn contrast to previous IndyCar Series races, where only the polesitter received one point, all 33 qualifying drivers earned championship points. The pole winner earned 15 points, with second and third receiving 13 and 12, respectively. Those who qualified on the second and third rows scored between 11 and 6 points in descending order. Each driver in positions 10 to 24 gained four points, while drivers in positions 25 to 33 got three points. Following the first and fastest four-lap average speed recorded during the Fast Nine Shootout by driver Hélio Castroneves, which was therefore unbeatable, the rules were changed such that all nine entrants of the session would run in reverse order from slowest to quickest.\n2014–2018.\nIn 2014, a two-day format was established. IndyCar officials planned three sessions over two days to increase broadcast viewership, track attendance, and entertainment. On the first day, the top 33 entries completed the provisional starting grid, and each car had at least one qualifying attempt. The fastest nine entrants qualified for the following day's Fast Nine Shootout. If more than 33 vehicles were entered, a driver who was not among the top 33 qualifiers did not advance to the second day's session.\nThe pit lane was divided into two distinct lanes. The first was called the \"Priority Lane\" for non-qualified vehicles or ones that had their previous qualifying lap times withdrawn, while the second was for already qualified drivers who desired another attempt. The withdrawal of the time was unnecessary. All of the previous day's laps were erased the next day, and those in positions 10 to 33 had to make another attempt to set the starting order. To set the top nine positions, the Fast Nine Shootout's nine qualifiers went out in reverse order from the previous day's slowest to fastest speeds.\nEvery qualifier on the first day received points, with the fastest driver getting 33 points and the slowest contender receiving one point. The pole sitting earned nine points, while the driver in ninth received one point. In 2016, this was changed to qualifying's second day, with the pole sitter collecting 42 points down to the 33rd-placed qualifier earning one point. The qualifying points format was significantly revised in 2018, with the pole sitter receiving nine points, down to one point for the ninth-placed qualifier.\n2019–present.\nFollowing debate when driver James Hinchcliffe failed to qualify in 2018, a modified version of the two-day format intended to be more exciting was used from 2019. Every driver had one qualifying run to claim a top 30 starting position on the first day, but more attempts could be made time and weather permitting until the track was closed. Positions 10 to 30 were claimed and did not re-qualify the following day. The second day included a one-hour Last Row Shootout for the slowest three qualifiers, as well as the Fast Nine Shootout. Each car in both sessions received one try, and their prior day's times were erased. The Last Row Shootout's order to set places 31 to 33 and demote any one from the starting order was based on the previous day's results, and the Fast Nine Shootout to set pole position through ninth ran in reverse order from the slowest to the quickest car from the previous day. The Last Row Shootout was extended to 75 minutes in 2020 to give each competitor three qualifying chances.\nIndyCar modified the format again in 2022 to more closely resemble its qualifying procedure on road and street circuits. Following the first day of qualifying to determine positions 13 to 30 through drivers' speeds, there would be two sessions to set the first four rows, including the pole position. The 60-minute Last Chance Qualifying session would occur if there were more than 33 entries and all were guaranteed of one or multiple tries until the session ended to decide positions 31 to 33 and the car that does not qualify for the race. Those in 13th to 33rd had their starting positions guaranteed if just 33 cars were entered. If a driver makes multiple tries, all of their other times are deleted, and the top non-qualified entry takes 33rd place. Participants got an extra cool-down lap after each attempt to reduce the effect of heat soak and to make further tries until there were 10 minutes left. The top 12 qualifiers compete in the second round of qualifying, with the fastest six advancing to the ensuing Fast Six Shootout to determine pole position to sixth place based on their final performance. The top six slowest qualifiers start from places seven through twelve according to their set time. Each driver receives one attempt in each session, which are run in reverse order from slowest to fastest.\nBeginning in 2023, the format's schedule was adjusted. The Top 12 Qualifying session now occurs before the Last Chance Qualifying session. Points are currently granted to the first 12 qualifiers, with the pole position starter earning 12 points and the driver starting in 12th place earning one."

        "text": "The Warriors are a Division 1 cricket team representing the Eastern Cape in South African domestic competitions. The Warriors take part in the CSA 4-Day Series first-class competition, the Momentum One-Day Cup and CSA T20 Challenge. The team's home venue is St George's Park in Port Elizabeth, as well as Buffalo Park in East London.\nHistory.\nThe Warriors were originally established as an entirely professional franchise team following reforms that were carried out to the South African domestic leagues in 2004–05. Traditionally, from 1893–94 to 2004–05, eleven provincial teams (with occasional additions) had competed in the Currie Cup. In 2004–05, the eleven provincial teams were rationalised into six new, entirely professional franchises, in all three formats. Eastern Province CC and Border CC were the former clubs that merged to form the Warriors.\nEastern Province CC and Border CC.\nEastern Province and Border both competed in the provincial Currie Cup from the 1890s until the creation of franchise teams in 2004. For both clubs, success was largely elusive throughout this period. Eastern Province's peak came in the mid to late 1980s with the team winning the series title in 1988–89, sharing the cup in 1989–90, and then a final outright win the following season in 1991–92. Four one-day titles, such as the Standard Bank Cup and the Nissan Cup, were also won during this time.\nBorder was one of the weakest cricketing teams in South Africa during the provincial domestic era. Border hold the record for the lowest aggregate score by a first class side in a match. During a Currie Cup match against Natal at Jan Smuts Ground in 1959–60, Border scored only 34 runs in the match - 16 in the first innings and 18 in the second innings. Border failed to win any first-class or List-A titles during the provincial era.\nFranchise Era.\nFollowing the 2004-05 domestic reforms, the provincial teams of Eastern Province and Border were merged to form the Warriors franchise. The Warriors were the most unsuccessful franchise between 2004–05 and 2020–21 in the 4-Day domestic series, failing to win a single title. The 2009–10 season was the most successful for the team, winning both the one-day title and the T20 cup. One more one-day title followed in 2017–18, however this was shared with the Dolphins.\nLike many of the other franchises, sponsorship rights were granted for the beginning of the team name. Until 2015, the official name of the team was the Chevrolet Warriors.\nReturn to Provincial Cricket.\nIn 2020, domestic cricket in South Africa was restructured once more and the six former franchise teams were dropped. In its place was a return to the more traditional two-division league format, with a total of fifteen professional teams competing. The previously semi-professional provincial cricket league has been absorbed, effectively forming the leagues second division. Promotion and relegation between the two divisions, not seen since the start of the franchise era in 2004, will return after 2023–24.\nThe former name of Eastern Province or even Eastern Cape could have returned during this time, however Eastern Province Cricket decided to maintain the brand recognition from the franchise era, with the new team continuing to be called the Warriors.\nDuring the month of October each year, the side eschews their traditional black and electric green colours in favour of a bold pink playing kit to show their support of Breast Cancer Awareness as well as their fundraising efforts for Reach for Recovery.\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nPlayers with international caps are listed in bold.\nThe above list represents the Warriors squad for the 2019/20 season."

        "text": "The 1912 Indianapolis 500-Mile Race, or International 500-Mile Sweepstakes Race, the second such race in history, was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Thursday, May 30, 1912. Indiana-born driver Joe Dawson won the race, leading only the final two laps. Ralph DePalma dominated the race, leading 196 of the 200 laps, and pulling out to an over 5-lap lead. But with just over two laps to go, his car failed with a broken connecting rod.\nSummary.\nIn the aftermath of victory by Ray Harroun in the single-seat Marmon \"Wasp\" in the first 500-Mile Race the year before, new rules made the presence of riding mechanics mandatory; maximum engine size remained 600 cubic inches (9.83 liters) displacement. At $50,000, the race purse was nearly double that of 1911.\nOut of 29 original entries, 24 qualified for the race by sustaining a speed faster than a minimum of 75 mph (120.7 km/h) for a full lap, an increase from the quarter-mile qualifying distance of the inaugural year. David Bruce-Brown was fastest at 88.45 mph (142.35 km/h), but starting positions were again determined by entry date. Lining up five cars to the first four rows and four to a fifth, a change from the previous year's starting method was movement of the pace car, a Stutz, from the inside of the first row to out in front of the field.\nUpon wave of the then-red starting flag, Teddy Tetzlaff took the lead in a Fiat from the third starting position in the center of the first row, and lead for the first two laps before being overtaken by the grey # 4 Mercedes of Ralph DePalma.\nDePalma's domination of most of the event was total, as he built an eventual five-and-a-half lap, eleven-minute advantage over second, and lead uncontested for the next 194 laps. On lap 87, DePalma led his 85th lap and became the all-time Indianapolis 500 lap leader with 89 laps led (he led 4 laps in the 1911 race), a title he would hold until lap 200 of the 1987 race, 75 years later. But at the beginning of lap 197, as his Mercedes began misfiring, and slowed on the main stretch at the conclusion of the lap. Nursed through the 198th lap by DePalma at reduced speed, the car finally lost all power at the end of the backstretch on lap 199, as a broken connecting rod tore a hole in the crankcase.\nWith the car's momentum carrying it around to the fourth turn, DePalma and riding mechanic Rupert Jeffkins then entered themselves into motor racing lore, as well as inspired the cheers of the more than 80,000 in attendance, as they climbed from the vehicle and begin pushing it down the five-eighths of a mile main stretch toward the start-finish line.\nIndianapolis driver Joe Dawson and riding mechanic Harry Martin, running in the second position for most of the race in their blue and white National Motor Vehicle Company entry, finally passed DePalma midway down the main stretch to assume the lead for the concluding two laps, a record that would be held for the fewest led laps in history until 2011, following DePalma's 196 laps in the lead being the most ever in a race by a non-winner. Finishing more than ten minutes ahead of newly-second place Tetzlaff, Dawson completed another two laps for good measure upon fear of a scoring miscue. Sometime thereafter, DePalma and Jeffkins finally brought their car across the line, but in twofold futile endeavour: Speedway rules, requiring that all entries move under their own power, marked DePalma's final number of circuits at 198, and the push across the line, even if it counted, brought them only to the beginning of the final lap.\nDawson's run in the American-manufactured, four-cylinder National, with a winning time of 6:21:06 and averaging 78.719 mph (126.686 km/h), was twenty-one minutes two seconds faster than the previous 1911 record; The National team garnered $20,000 and additional contingency awards.\nThroughout the remainder of the field, only the top ten finishers earned prize money, rules stipulating all entries complete the to collect. Ralph Mulford, being forced to stop numerous times due to clutch problems in his Knox, found irritation with the requirement and proceeded to drive on, long after all others were presented the chequered flag...and even after Speedway president Carl Fisher and starter Fred Wagner left the grounds (the latter after getting into an argument over whether to flag Mulford off before he had completed the distance, Wagner in favor and Fisher against).\nThrough numerous accounts of the run, including his reportedly changing shock absorbers for a gentler ride, as well as stopping for a dinner-on-the-go of fried chicken and ice-cream with his riding mechanic, Mulford's finish finally arrived, amid deserted grandstands and a setting sun over the main straightaway, 8 hours and 53 minutes after the start (approximately 6:53 p.m. local time), and with an average speed of 56.285 mph (90.582 km/h), which remains a record: the slowest finishing speed to date in 500 history.\nStarting grid.\nEntries were required to complete one lap in excess of 75 mph in order to qualify. However, starting grid was determined by order of entry date.\nNote: (*) Car qualified by Lee Frayer\nBox score.\nNote: Relief drivers in parentheses\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nNotes.\nRace field average engine displacement:\nRace field average qualifying speed:\nFinishing entries average time and finishing speed:"

        "text": "Christopher Robert Mason (born April 20, 1976) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender. He most recently played with Augsburger Panther of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). He previously played for four National Hockey League (NHL) teams. Mason is the colour analyst covering Predators games broadcast on Bally Sports South.\nPlaying career.\nWhile completing a junior career in the Western Hockey League (WHL) with the Prince George Cougars, Mason was originally drafted 122nd overall in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft by the New Jersey Devils. Embarking on his professional career and un-signed from the Devils, Mason signed as a free agent by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim on June 27, 1997. After his rookie professional season with the Ducks' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks, and on the eve of his sophomore season, Mason was traded by Anaheim along with Marc Moro to the Nashville Predators in exchange for Dominic Roussel.\nMason made his debut in the NHL with the Predators during the 1998–99 season, relieving in three games. After a further three seasons within the Predators organization, Mason left as a free agent and signed a contract with the Florida Panthers. Mason was assigned to Florida's AHL affiliate, the San Antonio Rampage, for the duration of the 2002–03 season. He re-signed with the Panthers to a one-year extension, however he never featured for the club before he was claimed in the 2003 NHL Waiver Draft to return to the Nashville Predators.\nIn the 2003–04 season, Mason joined the Predators full-time as the backup to starter Tomáš Vokoun. In 17 appearances that season, Mason finished with a 4–4–1 record with a 2.18 goals against average (GAA) and .926 save percentage.\nDuring the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Mason played for Vålerenga Ishockey in the Norwegian league with fellow Predator Scott Hartnell. Being hailed as the best goalie in the league ever, he played a big part in Vålerenga securing their 25th league championship and their 24th Norwegian Championship by winning the playoffs.\nOn April 15, 2006, when he was starting because starting goaltender Vokoun was lost for the year with a blood condition, Mason was credited for a goal when Phoenix Coyotes forward Geoff Sanderson shot the puck into his own net. Mason became the ninth NHL goaltender to score a goal and joined Damian Rhodes as the only goalies to be credited with a goal in both the AHL and the NHL.\nIn response, Mason said, \"It was a cheesy goal. Someone else should have received it.\"\nIn the off-season of 2007, Vokoun was traded to the Florida Panthers for a few draft picks, leaving Mason as the starter for Nashville, alone with backup goaltender Dan Ellis. Mason quickly won the first two games, the collective scores of which were 9–1 in favor of the Predators, but then dropped a startling seven straight games. Dan Ellis, however, was able to step up for the Predators and win four straight. Mason returned to play against the Detroit Red Wings in a 43-save loss. The loss was no surprise, but Mason did show that he could effectively remain the Nashville starter, and continued to start for the remainder of his time with the Predators.\nOn June 20, 2008, Mason was traded by the Predators to the St. Louis Blues for a fourth round draft pick. In two seasons as the Blues number one goalie, Mason appeared in career high 61 and 57 games, to post 27 and 30 wins respectively.\nOn July 1, 2010, Mason left the Blues and signed a two-year, $3.7 million deal with the Atlanta Thrashers, marking the first time in his NHL career that Mason played for an Eastern Conference team. Mason's 2010–11 campaign was a disappointment, as it marked the first time in his career that he posted a GAA above 3.00. Following the team's relocation, Mason played out the second season of his contract for the Winnipeg Jets.\nOn July 1, 2012, Mason returned for a third stint with the Nashville Predators, on a one-year deal to serve as the team's backup goalie. During the lockout shortened 2012–13 season, Mason was unable to recapture his earlier career form posting a career low goals against and save percentage.\nWith limited NHL interest at season's end, Mason signed abroad in Italy to a one-year contract with Ritten-Renon of the Elite.A on August 6, 2013. After a successful season in Italy, on May 23, 2014, he moved to Germany to sign a one-year contract with the Augsburger Panther of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL).\nOn September 21, 2015, Mason announced his retirement from professional hockey and that he would be joining the Nashville Predators Radio Network as a colour commentator for select games during the 2015–16 season.\nInternational play.\n \nMason made his international debut with Canada at the 2006 World Championships but did not play. He won a gold medal with team Canada at the 2007 World Championships as a third goaltender. He played his first game at the 2009 World Championships in Switzerland where he went 4–0 with a 1.00 GAA, and helped Canada to a silver medal.\nBased on the strong performance in 2009 World Championships and in the NHL regular season leading up to the Olympics, Mason was selected as a reserve by Team Canada for the 2010 Winter Olympics as a stand-by goaltender should an injury occur. He would play as the starting goaltender at the 2010 World Championships in Germany, where they lost against Team Russia in the quarter-finals. Mason also played for Team Canada at the 2013 Spengler Cup."

In front of a home crowd, they won the 2014–15 Hockey World League as the first international title after Aymar's retirement from the national team the previous year.\nAt a continental level, Argentina has dominated and won every tournament they played, including the Pan American Cup and the Pan American Games leaving the United States with second place on most events until they lost the 2011 Pan American Games final for the first time.\nIn July 2003, after the implementation of an official World Ranking System, Argentina reached the top of the FIH Women's World Ranking for the first time, reaching it again in 2010 after obtaining the World Cup title and once more in late 2013.\nHistory.\nHockey was introduced in Argentina by English immigrants at the beginning of the 20th century, and the first women's teams were officially formed in 1909. In 1997, Sergio Vigil, a former player for the men's national team, was appointed coach. Under his leadership, \"Las Leonas\" achieved their first World Hockey Cup title, their first Olympic medals, their first Champions Trophy medals, and many other achievements. The team went from having a rather limited audience to becoming a national sensation, with some of the players even appearing as models in advertising campaigns.\nNickname.\nThroughout its history, the team has developed a reputation for being tenacious even when a match appears to be lost. For this reason, a lioness was chosen as their symbol when the team qualified for the 2000 Summer Olympics. During the second round of games, Argentina played against the powerful Dutch team, and they chose this occasion to place the image of a lioness on their shirts for the first time.\nThe image was designed by then-player Inés Arrondo together with Vigil's sister-in-law. Argentina won that match, went on to win the silver medal, and \"Las Leonas\" were born. Subsequently, the junior (under 21) team is called \"Las Leoncitas\" (\"the baby lionesses\" or \"the lioness cubs\").\nThe lioness logo was redesigned in 2006 by the team kit supplier, Adidas, along with Confederación Argentina de Hockey and even some of the most representative players. This is slightly different from the original, showing the lioness' tail pretending to be a hockey stick while holding a ball.\nThe nickname also falls in line with an unwritten Argentine tradition of naming national teams after big cats: the men's field hockey team is called \"Los Leones\" (\"The Lions\"), the men's rugby union team is called \"Los Pumas\" (\"The Pumas\"), and the women's volleyball team is known as \"Las Panteras\" (\"The Panthers\").\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nThe following players were called to play a test match serie against United States between February 17th and 29th in Charlotte, United States. \nHead coach: Fernando Ferrara\nRecent call-ups.\nThese players were called up in the last 12 months.\nNot in use jersey numbers.\nWhen Luciana Aymar (eight-time FIH Player of the Year Award winner and regarded as the best player in the history of the sport), retired from the national team in 2014 after 376 international matches played, some of Aymar's teammates (such as Carla Rebecchi) asked the Confederation for the retirement of her iconic number 8 worn by her during 17 years with the national team. Nevertheless, the number is not officially retired by the CAH, although it has not been assigned to other players since.\nHonours.\nSince its breakthrough in the 2000 Summer Olympics (where the team nicknamed \"Las Leonas\"' for the first time), Argentina has won more than 20 official titles, which are detailed below:"

        "title": "Walter Davis (basketball)",
        "text": "Walter Pearl Davis (September 9, 1954 – November 2, 2023) was an American basketball player. After his college years with the North Carolina Tar Heels he played professionally as a forward/guard for 15 years in the National Basketball Association (NBA), spending the majority of his career with the Phoenix Suns. Davis was a six-time NBA All-Star, a two-time All-NBA Second Team member, and the NBA Rookie of the Year in 1978. In 1994, the Suns retired his No. 6 jersey and in 2004 he was enshrined in the team's Ring of Honor. Davis' 15,666 points during his time with the Suns is the most in franchise history. In 2024, it was announced that Davis would be posthumously inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nHigh school and college career.\nBorn in Pineville, North Carolina, Davis was the youngest of 13 children born between 1937 and 1954. His high school teams at South Mecklenburg High School in Charlotte won three state titles and lost only four games. After his senior year, he prepped at the Sanford School in Hockessin, Delaware, and made the Delaware All-State team in the 1972-73 season.\nAs a standout college player at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, he was selected to play on the USA men's basketball team coached by UNC's Dean Smith that won the gold medal at the 1976 Summer Olympics. In his freshman year, Davis hit a buzzer-beating jump shot against Duke at the end of regulation to send the game into overtime. At Chapel Hill, Davis was called \"Sweet D\" because of his seemingly effortless, smooth style of play and because of his strong defensive play.\nNBA career.\nThe Suns selected Davis with the fifth pick of the 1977 NBA draft. He made an immediate impact, playing in 81 games and averaging 24.2 points per game in his first season, which would also be his career-high. He won the 1978 Rookie of the Year Award, and earned second team All-NBA honors. Over his first ten seasons, Davis averaged over 20 points per game six times, and earned trips to six All-Star Games.\nOn February 25, 1983, Davis set an all-time NBA record when he successfully scored his first 34 points before finally missing a shot. He made his first 15 field goals and converted four straight free throws before missing a jumper with 55 seconds left in the game. Larry Costello had formerly held the record, having made all of his attempts on his first 32 points for the Syracuse Nationals in 1961. The following year, during the 1984 NBA Playoffs, Davis led the Suns to the Western Conference Finals, averaging 24.9 points, 6.7 assists, and 2.7 rebounds through 17 games, before Phoenix was eliminated by the Los Angeles Lakers.\nOver his career, Davis averaged 18.9 points, 3.8 assists and 3.0 rebounds per game. Davis was affectionately known as \"The Greyhound\" for his speedy style and sleek physical appearance. Suns broadcaster Al McCoy created many alternate nicknames for him, including \"The Candyman\", \"Sweet D\" and \"The Man with the Velvet Touch.\" Davis is the Suns' all-time leading scorer with 15,666 points.\nDavis's later years with the Suns were marred by recurring back problems and an ugly drug scandal. In 1987, he was called on to testify on illegal drug use by other Suns players in exchange for immunity from prosecution. (He had twice entered rehabilitation clinics to deal with cocaine addiction.)\nDavis's decline mirrored the short decline of the Suns franchise, and at the expiration of his contract in 1988 at age 33, the team did not seriously attempt to re-sign him, offering a one-year contract at half his previous salary.\nDavis signed a two-year, $1.35 million deal with the Denver Nuggets as an unrestricted free agent. He ended up playing for two years beyond this contract, and was included in a three-team trade in early 1991 that sent him to the Portland Trail Blazers for half a season. Davis finished 479 points shy of 20,000 points in a career. In the summer of 1991, he returned to Denver to close out his playing career.\nAfter basketball.\nDavis later served as a broadcaster for the Nuggets and as a scout for the Washington Wizards. As time passed, Davis and the Suns repaired their relationship. In 1994, his No. 6 was retired by the Suns, and in 2004 he was enshrined in the team's Ring of Honor. On October 28, 2023, Davis was reintroduced and given a commemorative watch from new Suns owner Mat Ishbia to celebrate the revamped version of the Phoenix Suns Ring of Honor.\nDavis was the uncle of UNC men's head coach Hubert Davis, who also played for UNC and in the NBA.\nDavis died in Charlotte, North Carolina, on November 2, 2023, at the age of 69. Following his death, Davis received his first nomination to be inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. On April 6, 2024, it was announced that Davis would be inducted to the Hall of Fame as part of the 2024 class."

Many of these features were eventually covered when interior bleachers were built, but in some cases that was not possible, and the terrace remained for the life of the ballpark.\nThis feature is to be distinguished from the normal gradual \"turtleback\" grading that is or was sometimes done in baseball and football fields in order to facilitate drainage."

        "title": "Howard Jones (American football coach)",
        "text": "Howard Harding Jones (August 23, 1885 – July 27, 1941) was an American football player and coach who served as the head coach at Syracuse University (1908), Yale University (1909, 1913), Ohio State University (1910), the University of Iowa (1916–1923), Duke University (1924) and the University of Southern California (1925–1940), compiling a career record of 194–64–21. His 1909 Yale team, 1921 Iowa team, and four of his USC teams (1928, 1931, 1932, 1939) won national championships. Jones coached USC in five Rose Bowls, winning all of them. Before coaching, Jones played football at Yale (1905–1907), where he played on three national title-winning teams. He was a member of the inaugural class of inductees into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1951; his younger brother, Tad, joined him as a member in 1958.\nEarly life and playing career.\nJones was born in Excello, Ohio, near Middletown. He played football for three seasons at Yale University, from 1905 to 1907. During his three years, the Yale Bulldogs never lost a game, going 28–0–2. Yale claims national championships for all three seasons.\nCoaching career.\nSyracuse, Yale and Ohio State.\nAfter graduating in 1908, Jones became the head coach at Syracuse University on the advice of Walter Camp, leading the Orangemen to a 6–3–1 record before returning to Yale as the head coach. He led Yale to a 10–0 record in 1909, a season in which Yale claims another national championship. Yale's 15–0 victory over Syracuse in 1909 was significant in that it was the first time that two brothers had ever faced each other as opposing head coaches. Syracuse was then coached by Howard Jones's brother, Tad Jones.\nAfter the 1909 season, Howard Jones served a one-year stint as head football coach at Ohio State University in 1910, leading the Buckeyes to a 6–1–3 record. Jones spent four of his next five years in private business, returning only to coach Yale to a 5–2–3 record in 1913. A lack of team talent drove him toward greener pastures, and he would eventually enjoy great success at the University of Iowa and the University of Southern California.\nIowa.\nReed Lane, a businessman on the Iowa Athletic Board, was a classmate of Jones's when they both attended a Yale preparatory school. When Jesse Hawley left after the 1915 season, Iowa offered Jones a contract to become Iowa's 11th head football coach on the recommendation of Lane. Jones accepted a five-year contract at $4,500 annually, the longest commitment and most money ever offered to a coach at Iowa.\nJones's first two years were highlighted by a 67–0 loss to Minnesota in 1916 and a 47–0 loss to Nebraska in 1917. Jones vowed he would never lose by such scores again, and he did not; they remained the two worst losses of his career. In 1918, Iowa defeated Minnesota for the first time in school history. It would be the first of five straight wins over Minnesota for Jones, and three over Nebraska.\nThe loss of Fred Becker hurt Iowa during that time. Becker was Iowa's first first team All-American as a sophomore in 1916. He could have been a potential star for Jones, but he played just one season before enlisting for the service with the outbreak of World War I. Becker was killed in combat just ten months after being named an All-American.\nWorld War I altered the college football landscape. Eligibility rules were relaxed in the Big Ten Conference in 1918. Iowa's athletic director also left to serve in the war, so Jones was appointed to that position as well. Iowa's game with Coe College in 1918 was played with no fans in the stands, as public officials feared a flu epidemic. Iowa reportedly won, 27–0. In 1918 and 1919, Iowa fell just short of the Big Ten title, with losses to Illinois costing the Hawkeyes the crown in both seasons. Jones also coached the Iowa baseball team in 1919. In 1920, Iowa had the top two scorers in the Big Ten and finished with a 5–2 record.\nStill, Iowa had not won a conference title in 21 years. All that changed in 1921, when Iowa finished with a perfect 7–0 record and won the Big Ten title outright. The most notable win of the season was a 10–7 triumph over Notre Dame. It was Jones's first meeting with Notre Dame coach Knute Rockne. The win snapped a 20-game winning streak for Rockne and Notre Dame, which would be the longest winning streak of Rockne's career. One of the criticisms fans had of the previous Iowa coach, Hawley, was that he could not convince talented Iowa players to play at Iowa. Jones succeeded in that respect; the 1921 Hawkeyes started 11 native Iowans.\nDespite the graduations of many key players, Iowa again posted a perfect 7–0 final record in 1922. Iowa again went 5–0 in the Big Ten, capturing its second straight Big Ten crown. It is the only time in Iowa history that the Hawkeyes have won consecutive conference titles. The most notable win of the 1922 season was a victory over Yale, then coached by Howard's brother, Tad. It was the first time a \"western\" team had ever defeated Yale in New Haven. Iowa's winning streak from 1920–1923 under Jones lasted 20 games and almost three full years.\nHoward Jones's wife was not fond of Iowa City, and he demanded a new contract, which would allow him to coach and live in Iowa City only during football season. A conflict between Jones and the chairman of the Athletics Board at Iowa contributed to the tension, and Jones eventually resigned as head coach and athletic director at Iowa.\nDuke and USC.\nJones coached in 1924 at Trinity College, now known as Duke University, before leaving for USC in 1925. In 16 seasons at USC, Jones coached seven Pacific Coast Conference championship teams and four more national champions, and won each of the five Rose Bowls in which his Trojans played . In the 1920s, USC won two Rose Bowls, in 1923 and 1930. Heading into the 1930 Rose Bowl, USC had defeated its crosstown rival UCLA 76–0 in their first meeting.\nMoments before a USC-Stanford game, Jones visited the Stanford locker room and discovered Stanford All-American halfback Bobby Grayson was nursing an injured knee. Jones returned to the USC quarters and instructed his players to avoid hitting Grayson in the crippled leg. They never did.\n In 1939 and 1940, Jones's teams again won the Rose Bowl. In those two Rose Bowl games, USC faced teams that were unbeaten, untied and unscored-upon. First it was Duke, which led after an early fourth quarter 23-yard field goal by Tony Ruffa, but backup USC quarterback Doyle Nave completed four straight passes to \"Antelope\" Al Krueger who outmaneuvered Eric \"The Red\" Tipton, scoring the winning touchdown with one minute remaining. Krueger's touchdown marked the first points scored against Duke during the season. In the 1940 Rose Bowl, the Trojans defeated the Tennessee Volunteers 14–0, ending a 23-game Tennessee winning streak and scoring the first points scored against the Volunteers all season.\nUSC historian Al Wesson remarked, \"Howard lived and breathed football. If it were not for football, he would have starved to death – couldn't possibly have made a living in business.\"\nOne of the players Jones coached while at USC was legendary film star John Wayne.\nWesson also recalled, \"His assistants tried to get him to organize the practices and let them do most of the heavy work. He'd promise to do it, but after 15 minutes on the field, he'd be down on the ground showing them personally how to block, following every play on the dead run, and acting as though he were still playing end at Yale. He just couldn't relax and let others do the heavy work.\"\nJones lived in Toluca Lake, California. On the hot morning of July 27, 1941, while home alone and washing and waxing his car, Jones fell ill and called his doctor, who lived nearby. By the time he arrived, Jones was dead; he had suffered a heart attack. The sudden, unexpected death was a shock to family, friends and fans: Several thousand people attended his funeral at First Methodist Church in Hollywood. He was buried in Woodside Cemetery &amp; Arboretum at Middletown, Ohio.\nCoaching style and personality.\nJones was known for being completely absorbed in the sport and aloof outside of it. While he and Notre Dame's Knute Rockne were the two most famous coaches in America in the 1930s, beyond football their personalities were completely different: Rockne was a natural showman, Jones was a terrible public speaker and humorless. His appearance, described as \"stone-faced\" and \"severe-looking\" kept him intimidating.\nThough quiet off the field, when coaching, Jones was intimidating and energetic. Although his players and assistant coaches had a hard time relating to him, all had absolute confidence in his abilities. While admired for his integrity and scruples, Jones's formidable personality led him to be an authoritarian coach at times, and he did not tolerate discussion. Jones did not like spending time on recruiting, relying mostly on his assistants, and recruited only very few players. His assistants Bob McNeish, Hobbs Adams and Jeff Cravath are credited with bringing in the players who enabled USC to win two more Rose Bowls after lean years in the mid-1930s.\nHonors.\nAll told, Jones's career record was 194–64–21, a .733 winning percentage, in over 28 seasons at Syracuse, Yale, Ohio State, Iowa, Duke and Southern California.\nThe USC–Ohio State game on October 5, 1946 was designated as the \"Howard Jones Memorial Game\" in honor of the late Trojan and Buckeye coach. The dedication was intended to drive funding to build a \"Howard Jones Memorial Fieldhouse and Armory\" on campus at the University of Southern California.\nJones was a member of the College Football Hall of Fame's inaugural class of inductees in 1951."

        "title": "Tour de France (song)",
        "text": "\"Tour de France\" is a song by German electronic band Kraftwerk. It was first issued in early August 1983, peaking at number 22 in the United Kingdom singles chart on 6 August.\nBackground.\nIt is notable for the use of sampled voices and mechanical sounds associated with cycling that were used to supplement a simple electro-percussion pattern – an approach Kraftwerk had used on earlier tracks such as \"Metal on Metal\" (from \"Trans-Europe Express\") and \"Numbers\" (from \"Computer World\"). The music is credited to Ralf Hütter, Florian Schneider and Karl Bartos; the lyrics are credited to Hütter and Maxime Schmitt, a French label associate of the band. The melody appears to quote a fragment of the opening section of Paul Hindemith's \"Sonata for Flute and Piano\" (\"Heiter Bewegt\").\nThe sleeve design depicted the band on road bikes in a paceline, superimposed across an angled representation of the French national flag. The design was adapted from an image that had appeared on a 1953 Hungarian postage stamp, one of a sport-themed set commemorating the opening the Népstadion (People's Stadium) in Budapest. The piece was also included in the 1984 film \"Breakin\"', also known as \"Breakdance\" internationally. Although the song did appear briefly in the film, Kraftwerk did not let the song appear on the movie soundtrack; instead, a cover version of the song was released by a group called \"10 Speed\".\nComposition.\nFor Kraftwerk, \"Tour de France\" was a departure from the technological tone of the two previous albums, \"The Man-Machine\" and \"Computer World\". Instead, the song is a joie de vivre celebration of cycling, marking the group's increasing interest in the sport. Of the current line-up, Hütter and Fritz Hilpert have been known to take part in cycling events. The track was originally recorded with the intention of being included on the subsequently abandoned \"Techno Pop\" album. The single was originally released on seven and twelve inch vinyl, and as a cassette-single. It has the most complicated set of variants of any Kraftwerk song, having been variously edited and remixed to the point that there is no completely definitive version.\nReleases.\nOriginal release.\nIn Germany it was released in both German- and French-language versions, one on each side of the vinyl disc, but in other countries the versions of the song that were issued were sung only in French. Typically, the seven-inch sides were edited down versions of the longer tracks released on twelve-inch singles. In the UK however the seven-inch B-side was an instrumental edit of the A-side track; an additional instrumental track of percussion and samples, \"Tour de France, Étape 2\", was included on the UK twelve-inch and cassette releases.\nRemix release.\nOn 22 June 1984 the song was re-released in two new versions: a substantially different and largely instrumental arrangement, remixed by François Kevorkian in New York; and a Kraftwerk-remixed alternative version of the original arrangement, featuring longer percussive sections than the 1983 version in the latter half of the track. Sleeves for later UK pressings of this version included the message \"As featured in the film \"Breakdance\"\" on the front. The remix reached number 24 on the UK Singles Chart and number 4 on the US Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart.\nDigital remaster.\nIn October 1999, the recordings were digitally remastered and released, this time as a CD and a twelve-inch single, with a slightly modified version of the original cover design: the faces of former members Karl Bartos and Wolfgang Flür, who had left the band by 1999, were replaced by faces presumably representing current members Fritz Hilpert and Henning Schmitz.\nThe 1999 vinyl twelve-inch had the 1984 Kraftwerk remix as the A side (now sub-titled \"Kling Klang Analog Mix\") and the Kevorkian version as the B side (re-titled \"Remix François K\"). The CD also included the 1983 seven-inch single edited mix of the song (re-titled \"Radio Version\") and a QuickTime format file of the video, featuring an edited version of the 1984 Kraftwerk remix with German lyrics (\"Multi-Media-Track\") over an amended video. The video itself was re-edited to remove sequences showing the 1983 incarnation of the band and now comprised only archive footage of Tour de France cyclists, such as the Italian champion Fausto Coppi and the French champion Jacques Anquetil.\n2003 version.\nA completely new recording was made for the 2003 album \"Tour de France Soundtracks\", based on the original 1983 arrangement. The album was remastered and re-released in 2009.\nMusic videos.\nFor the 1983 release a video clip with cycling footage was released. The 1984 Kevorkian version had a rare video which included footage of the band members in Düsseldorf on their bicycles. The 1999 release had the same video as the 1983 Version.\nTrack listing.\nUK 12-inch vinyl, 1983\nCatalog number: 12 EMI 5413\nUK 7-inch vinyl, 1983\nCatalog number: EMI 5413\nUK cassette, 1983\nCatalog number: TC-EMI 5413\nUS 12-inch vinyl, 1984\nCatalog number: 20146\nUK 12-inch vinyl, 1984\nCatalog number: 12 EMI 5413\nUK 7-inch vinyl, 1984\nCatalog number: EMI 5413\nGerman 12-inch vinyl, 1983\nCatalog number: 1CK 052 1652046\nGerman 7-inch vinyl, 1983\nCatalog number: 1C 006 1652047\nGerman 12-inch vinyl, 1984 (1)\nCatalog number: 1CK 052 1652046\nGerman 12-inch vinyl, 1984 (2)\nCatalog number: 1CK 062 2003776\nGerman 7-inch vinyl, 1984\nCatalog number: 1C 006 200376-7\nEU 12-inch vinyl, 1999\nCatalog number: 7243 8 87421 6 0 "

        "title": "James Harrison (American football)",
        "text": "James Henry Harrison Jr. (born May 4, 1978) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Kent State Golden Flashes and was signed by the Pittsburgh Steelers as an undrafted free agent in 2002. A five-time Pro Bowl selection, Harrison won two Super Bowls with the Steelers: XL and XLIII. In 2008, he became the only undrafted player to be named Associated Press NFL Defensive Player of the Year. Harrison was known for his hard-hitting style during games.\nHarrison also played for NFL Europe's Rhein Fire and had brief stints with the Baltimore Ravens and Cincinnati Bengals. After the 2013 season, he stated that he would be retiring from the NFL, but he came out of retirement to return to the Steelers, and spent part of his final NFL season with the New England Patriots. Harrison is tied with Cameron Heyward for second on the Steelers' all-time sack leader ranking, behind only T. J. Watt, with 80.5. He currently appears on FS1 as a football analyst.\nEarly years.\nBorn in Akron, Ohio, Harrison was the youngest of 14 children to James Sr. (a chemical truck driver) and Mildred. He played Little League baseball in Scranton, Pennsylvania for Sloan Little League's Green Team. He was selected to the All-Star team in 1991. He grew up in Akron, and his favorite NFL team was the Cleveland Browns, who played only 40 miles from his house. Initially, his mother did not want him to play football. It took both Harrison and his best friend from childhood, David Walker, to convince her. When he started to play, he excelled at both linebacker and running back. He attended two high schools his freshman year, Archbishop Hoban High School then Coventry High School, where, in addition to football, also participated in track &amp; field, competing in events ranging from the shot put to the high jump. He had PR of 15.63 meters (51 ft 3in) in the shot put, 38.86 meters in the discus throw (127 ft 5 in) and 1.85 meters (6 ft 1 in) in the high jump. He was also a state-qualifier in the 4 × 100 m relay. Harrison along with Jonathan Holloman were two of the first African-Americans to play football at Coventry. Harrison graduated in 1998.\nHis high school football ability was great, but his lack of maturity at times was a struggle. Harrison did not pay attention to his grades or college entrance tests, and by his senior year he had become disruptive to his football team. Early in his senior year, Coventry staff had to suspend him for two games for challenging an assistant coach to a fight. After he returned from his suspension, in his next game, he began the game by carrying 3 times for nearly 100 yards and 2 touchdowns. After his second TD, he ran down the opposing team's sideline, and was ejected and later suspended for one game for making obscene gestures to the fans. Harrison was in court soon thereafter, after he shot a BB gun in the school locker room towards a defensive coach. He pled guilty to a minor charge and was able to return to school to finish his senior year. Due to his off-the-field issues, powerhouse football programs like Ohio State, Notre Dame, and Nebraska rescinded their scholarship offers.\nCollege career.\nHarrison attended Kent State University and walked on the Kent State Golden Flashes football team. After sitting out his freshman season in 1998 due to NCAA academic guidelines, Harrison became a starter for the last three games of the 1999 season and led the team with 106 total tackles and 13 tackles for a loss. He also had an interception and three fumble recoveries.\nDuring his last collegiate game against Miami University, Harrison finished with 12 tackles, 5 sacks, and a forced fumble. At the end of the fourth quarter, he sacked future teammate, Ben Roethlisberger on third and fourth down to seal a 24–20 victory. In 2001, he recorded 98 total tackles, 20 tackles for loss, and led the MAC conference with 15 sacks, while also being voted to first-team Mid-American Conference.\nAfter graduating, he returned in 2010 to be inducted into Kent State's Varsity \"K\" Hall of Fame along with San Diego Chargers tight end, Antonio Gates. Harrison also made a donation of $100k to his alma mater, who in turn named the field house in his honor. In 2013, Kent State retired Harrison's jersey number 16.\nProfessional career.\nPittsburgh Steelers.\nHarrison went undrafted in the 2002 NFL draft, as teams feared he was too short (six feet) to play linebacker, and too light (240 pounds) to play on the defensive line. A few teams did send him training camp invites.\nThe Steelers signed Harrison as an undrafted rookie in 2002, making him the first Kent State alumnus to play at linebacker for the team since Hall of Famer Jack Lambert.\nHarrison spent two years on and off the practice squad for the Steelers, being released three times, and also was briefly on the active roster towards the end of the 2002 season, playing only special teams. Teammate and fellow linebacker, James Farrior, later told NFL Network that Harrison was so green early on in his career that he would simply \"give up\" on plays on which he was struggling and even would ask the coaches not to play him when he was struggling. Farrior said, \"He was a knucklehead that didn't know the plays. We'd be in practice, in training camp, and he might not know what he was doing so he'd just stop and throw his hands up and tell (the coaches) to get him out of there. We thought the guy was crazy.\"\nHarrison wore number 93 during this period before adopting his more well known number 92, which at the time was worn by fellow linebacker and Pro Bowler Jason Gildon.\nBaltimore Ravens and Rhein Fire.\nHe was signed by Baltimore in late 2003, then sent to the Rhein Fire of NFL Europe, but eventually was cut by the Ravens.\nSecond stint with Steelers.\n2004.\nAfter being cut for a fourth time, Harrison considered not playing anymore. Shortly thereafter, he was signed a fourth time by the Steelers during training camp in 2004 after Clark Haggans sustained an injury in an offseason weightlifting accident. Showing much improvement, Harrison made the final roster and remained with the Steelers through the 2012 season. Harrison later told the \"Beaver County Times\" that if not for Haggans's injury, he planned to retire from football at age 26 to focus on becoming a veterinarian, something that Harrison still plans on doing now that his football career has ended. Harrison also considered following in his father's footsteps to become a truck driver, and to this day does have a commercial driver's license.\nThroughout the 2004 season, Harrison mostly played on special teams and on defense at linebacker, with occasional reps at defensive end. His first career start came against his hometown Cleveland Browns in Cleveland on November 14 after teammate Joey Porter and Browns running back William Green were ejected for fighting during the pregame warm-ups. Harrison had a good game statistically in the Steelers' 24–10 victory against their hated rival.\nHarrison scored his first career touchdown on a fumble recovery in the final week of the season against the Buffalo Bills.\n2005–2006.\nHarrison started in three games of the 2005 season when starting linebacker Clark Haggans was injured. His biggest highlight of the year was in a game against the San Diego Chargers, where he intercepted a Drew Brees pass for a 25-yard return. During the return, he made a huge leap over LaDainian Tomlinson, the Chargers star running back.\nHarrison gained some attention and popularity when he restrained a Cleveland Browns fan during a 41–0 Pittsburgh win on Christmas Eve. The intoxicated fan was on the field when Harrison lifted the man and slammed him on the ground. Harrison restrained the fan until authorities took him away.\nThe Steelers went on to win Super Bowl XL that season. Although Harrison was not a major factor in the game, he did play and earn a Super Bowl ring with the team, recording a team-high three special teams tackles.\n2007.\nIn the 2007 offseason, with longtime head coach Bill Cowher resigning after 15 seasons and Mike Tomlin taking over the reins, the Steelers controversially cut Joey Porter for salary cap reasons. Although the Steelers drafted two linebackers with their first two picks that year (Lawrence Timmons and LaMarr Woodley), Harrison was appointed the starter in place of Porter. The decision would ultimately pay off, as Harrison would go on to have a breakout season, making All-Pro Second-team and earning his first trip to the Pro Bowl as a starter on the AFC squad.\nOn November 5, Harrison had a standout game on \"Monday Night Football\" against the Baltimore Ravens. He piled up 9 total tackles, 3.5 sacks, 3 forced fumbles, 1 fumble recovery, and 1 interception. The most memorable moment of the game, however, was Harrison's tackle of Baltimore safety Ed Reed. After a Steelers punt by Daniel Sepulveda, Reed had recovered the kick and was looking to return it. As Reed ran up the sidelines, he was blindsided by Harrison and the ball was knocked away from Reed's grasp. Pittsburgh linebacker Lawrence Timmons immediately recovered the fumble. The Steelers would go on to blow out the Ravens, 38–7.\nOn November 26, during a Monday Night Football game, an announcer gave Harrison the nickname, \"Mr. Monday Night\", because of his outstanding performance on November 5. He piled up 8.5 sacks, 7 forced fumbles, 3 recovered fumbles, and 98 tackles on the year. He was voted team MVP for the 2007 season.\n2008.\nIn the Steelers' Week 4 \"Monday Night Football\" game against the Baltimore Ravens, Harrison recorded 10 total tackles, 2.5 sacks, 2 tackles for a loss, and a forced fumble.\nAlong with LaMarr Woodley, who by this point was a starter in his own right, after the team chose not to re-sign Clark Haggans the previous offseason, Harrison and Woodley had become arguably the team's best pass-rushing duo since Greg Lloyd and Kevin Greene in 1994. Harrison amassed 16 sacks, breaking the team record set by Mike Merriweather in 1984. The two teammates set a team record with 27.5 sacks.\nHarrison also played special teams on a regular basis, making him one of the few regular NFL starters to also play special teams. His most notable special teams play for 2008, however, arguably cost the Steelers their game against the New York Giants in Week 8. With the Steelers leading 14–12 in the fourth quarter and having to punt from their own end zone, Harrison played as long snapper after regular long snapper Greg Warren suffered a season-ending knee injury earlier in the game. Harrison inadvertently snapped it over Mitch Berger's head for a safety, tying the score.\nOn January 5, 2009, Harrison was named the AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year for the 2008 season, beating out Cowboys linebacker DeMarcus Ware for the award. Harrison became the first undrafted player to win the award.\nDuring Super Bowl XLIII, Harrison made his most famous play when he intercepted a pass from Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner at the goal line and ran back the length of the field for a 100-yard touchdown at the end of the first half. In a memorable scene, Harrison collapsed in the endzone and spent several minutes regaining his breath as his teammates celebrated. It was the longest play in Super Bowl history (surpassing Desmond Howard's 99-yard kickoff return in Super Bowl XXXI, being broken by Jacoby Jones in Super Bowl XLVII with a 108-yard kickoff return) and helped the Steelers defeat the Arizona Cardinals 27–23. It was also the longest interception return in Steelers franchise history, surpassing the 99-yard return by Martin \"Butch\" Kottler which occurred in the club's and was the oldest team record on the books.\nBefore the game, Gregg Easterbrook (author of \"Tuesday Morning Quarterback\" from Page 2 on ESPN.com) named Harrison the 2008 \"Tuesday Morning Quarterback Non-QB Non-RB NFL MVP\". When receiving the trophy for the award, Harrison said he never even heard of the award. The week before, Easterbrook named Harrison to his annual \"All-Unwanted All-Pros\" due to his struggles earlier in his career of having been cut four times, three by the Steelers.\nOn February 7, 2009, Harrison was parodied on \"Saturday Night Live\"s \"Weekend Update\" by cast member Kenan Thompson. Thompson depicted Harrison as being seemingly still out of breath and exhausted after his 100-yard interception return in the Super Bowl the week before.\n2009.\nOn April 13, 2009, it was reported that Harrison signed a 6-year, $51.75 million contract extension with the Steelers.\nIn four games in October Harrison had 7.0 sacks, 25 tackles, two forced fumbles and a fumble recovery. He earned AFC defensive player of the month honors for October. Harrison ended the Season with 79 tackles, 60 of them being solo, and 10 sacks. This outstanding performance made him a starter in the Pro Bowl that year. Although Heath Miller, LaMarr Woodley, and Casey Hampton were named Pro Bowlers as well, Harrison was the only starter from his team.\n2010.\nHarrison's 2010 season was marred by committing several penalties and fouls. He was fined for the hits that were deemed to be illegal by referees and the NFL. In Week 2, Harrison was fined for flipping Vince Young of the Titans. On October 17, he knocked out two Browns wide receivers; Mohammed Massaquoi, and his former college teammate, Josh Cribbs. On Halloween against the Saints, he hit quarterback Drew Brees late from behind. Against the Raiders, he hit another QB, Jason Campbell. The following week at Buffalo, another incident occurred when Ryan Fitzpatrick had thrown a complete pass to David Nelson, Harrison came out of the line and speared Fitzpatrick. Harrison was fined an estimated $120,000 in total.\nIn 2010 Harrison logged 100 tackles total, 70 solo tackles, 10.5 sacks, 2 interceptions and 6 forced fumbles.\nHarrison would help the Steelers reach the Super Bowl for the third time in six years. In Super Bowl XLV, Harrison recorded a sack on Aaron Rodgers, but lost 31–25 to the Green Bay Packers.\n2011–2012.\nIn 2011, Harrison recorded 59 tackles and nine sacks in 11 games. In 2012, he had six sacks and 70 tackles.\nOn March 9, 2013, Harrison was released by the Steelers for salary cap reasons after they could not agree on a pay cut.\nCincinnati Bengals.\nHarrison signed with the Cincinnati Bengals on April 23, 2013. He recorded 30 total tackles (16 solo), 2 sacks and an interception in limited playing time. On March 13, 2014, he was released by the Bengals.\nInitial retirement and third stint with Steelers.\nHarrison announced his retirement on August 30, 2014 and officially retired as a member of the Pittsburgh Steelers on September 5, 2014. On September 23, 2014, rumors surfaced that Harrison was set to return to the NFL after Mike Tomlin noted in a press conference that there were significant injuries suffered by members of the Steelers defense. The Steelers posted a message on their Twitter page announcing that Harrison would return to the Steelers.\nHarrison officially signed with the Steelers on September 23, 2014. He recorded 45 tackles and 5.5 sacks in 11 games.\nOn March 22, 2015 Harrison signed a two-year extension with Pittsburgh for $2.65 million and a $500k signing bonus.\nOn February 17, 2016, Harrison announced that he would be returning for a 14th season with the team.\nOn November 20, 2016, Harrison surpassed Jason Gildon to become the Steelers' all-time sack leader with 77.5, during a 24–9 win over the Cleveland Browns and finished the season with 79.5 sacks during his Steelers career. On January 8, 2017, he recorded ten combined tackles, sacked Matt Moore 1½ times, and forced a fumble in a 30–12 AFC Wildcard victory over the Miami Dolphins.\nOn March 1, 2017, Harrison signed a two-year contract extension with the Steelers. Through the first 12 games of the 2017 season, Harrison played only 29 snaps, with 15 of those coming in Week 6 against the Kansas City Chiefs. Following injuries to Ryan Shazier and Tyler Matakevich and the subsequent move of Arthur Moats from the outside to the inside linebacker position, Harrison played 11 snaps in Week 14 against the Baltimore Ravens. On December 23, 2017, Harrison was released by the Steelers after only playing in five games and being a healthy scratch for most of the season.\nNew England Patriots and second retirement.\nOn December 26, 2017, Harrison signed a one-year contract with the New England Patriots. In his debut, Harrison registered two sacks, a forced fumble, and five total tackles against the New York Jets. Harrison and the Patriots went on to reach Super Bowl LII, but lost 41–33 to the Philadelphia Eagles.\nOn April 16, 2018, Harrison announced his second retirement from the NFL after 15 seasons, saying in an Instagram post, \"I’ve missed way too much for way too long...I’m done\".\nActing.\nHarrison plays Apocalypse on \"Heels\". Harrison also appeared on \"S.W.A.T.\" in the Season 2 episode \"The B-Team\", playing Marcus King, the social media manager for the Los Angeles Fire Department when the LAFD goes against the Los Angeles Police Department in a charity competition.\nPersonal life.\nAs well as being nicknamed \"Silverback\", Harrison's teammates also call him Deebo, after the character from the \"Friday\" movies.\nHe has two sons, James Harrison III, born in 2007, and Henry, born in 2009.\nHarrison elected not to visit the White House with the rest of the team after the Steelers won Super Bowl XLIII. Skipping the visit gained some media attention, as Harrison said that Barack Obama (who supported the Steelers in the game and considers his second favorite NFL team after his hometown team, Chicago Bears) would have invited the Arizona Cardinals had they won: \"This is how I feel — if you want to see the Pittsburgh Steelers, invite us when we don't win the Super Bowl. As far as I'm concerned, he [Obama] would've invited Arizona if they had won.\" Harrison had also skipped the team's visit after winning Super Bowl XL when George W. Bush was president.\nArrest.\nHarrison was arrested in March 2008 and was charged with simple assault and criminal mischief stemming from a domestic altercation with his girlfriend, Beth Tibbott. On April 3, 2008, the district attorney dropped all charges because Harrison had completed anger management counseling and psychological counseling.\nThe arrest gained some controversy after the team released wide receiver Cedrick Wilson in a similar, but unrelated, incident around the same time but did not release Harrison. The Steelers even issued a press release shortly after they released Wilson stating that Harrison's incident and Wilson's incident were examined \"on a case-by-case basis\" and Wilson's incident determined that his warranted release while Harrison had \"taken responsibility for his actions.\" Steelers owner Dan Rooney, a lifelong devout Catholic, added that the incident was concerning their son's baptism, that Harrison's girlfriend reportedly did not want their son baptized, and that Harrison promptly called the Rooney family about the incident. Nonetheless, there were still accusations of a double standard because of the timing of both Harrison's and Wilson's incidents. The NFL, which had been cracking down on off-the-field conduct, took no action in either incident.\nDog incident.\nOn May 23, 2009, Harrison's son, James III, sustained an injury to his thigh when the family's pit bull became agitated and bit him. The boy's mother, Beth Tibbott, who had let the dog out of his cage, was also bitten when she tried to intervene. The dog also bit the player's massage therapist, who needed three stitches. Harrison's agent, William Parise, said the boy's injuries were \"serious but certainly not life-threatening.\" Three days later, James III was released from the hospital. The pit bull was scheduled to be euthanized but, through the team, Harrison was able to place the dog in a temporary home which specializes in training aggressive dogs.\n\"Men's Journal\" article.\nOn July 13, 2011, a controversial magazine article titled \"James Harrison: Confessions of an NFL Hitman\" was published by Paul Solotaroff in \"Men's Journal\". In the article, Harrison was asked multiple questions about who he is and why he plays the game of football the way he does. The controversy comes into play when Harrison begins talking about the NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. Harrison called Goodell a \"crook and a puppet\", and then proceeded to say that \"I hate him and will never respect him.\" Harrison also made comments towards his quarterback, Ben Roethlisberger, and other players in the National Football League such as Brian Cushing. Harrison released an apology for his statements on July 14, 2011."

One of the new rules put into place by the new league was that all teams had to be located in cities that had a population of 75,000 or more.

        "text": "David Alan Lewis (born 1 June 1964) is a former Irish cricketer and rugby union referee. He is also an occasional media commentator on Irish cricket. His father, Ian, and daughters, Robyn and Gaby, have also played cricket for Ireland,\nCricket.\nA right-handed batsman and right-arm medium pace bowler, he played 121 times for the Ireland cricket team between 1984 and 1997, including eight first-class matches against Scotland and 23 List A matches.
