        "title": "Jason Rowe (basketball)",
        "text": "Jason L Rowe (born June 16, 1978) is an American former professional basketball player. He played at Buffalo Traditional School in his native Buffalo, New York, leaving as the all-time leader in points and assists, and then signed to play college basketball for the Loyola Greyhounds in the MAAC, where he was a two-time all-conference performer. \nAfter his senior year at Loyola he went undrafted in the 2000 NBA draft and moved to Cyprus, where he made his professional debut with APOEL. In his 15-year career he has played in Argentina, Cyprus, France, Greece, Israel, Morocco, Poland, Spain, Turkey and Ukraine; in 2006 he was the top scorer of the LNB Pro A, the top level of French basketball, and was named the league's Foreign MVP the same year.\nRowe is currently head coach of Bishop Timon – St. Jude High School.\nHigh school career.\nJason Rowe was born in Buffalo, New York; his family enjoyed basketball: his father Jerry played in high school and was a local scout, while uncle Lester Rowe played in the NCAA Division I for the West Virginia Mountaineers. Rowe started playing the sport at a very young age, and when he was 8 years old he was playing with older kids (aged 13 and under). He enrolled at Buffalo Traditional School in the fifth grade, and in the 8th grade he participated in a basketball camp organized by Georgia Tech. In his freshman year he was already considered one of Traditional's varsity team best players. Playing under coach Joe Cardinal, Rowe averaged 23 points, 6 rebounds and 12 assists per game in his sophomore season.\nIn his junior year, Rowe was named in the Class C first team. He was described by \"The Baltimore Sun\" as a 5-foot-9, 155-pounds point guard with good court vision and a 36-inches vertical leap. Rowe averaged 22 points, 12 assists and 5 steals his junior year. He and Tim Winn were named co-Players of the Year by \"The Buffalo News\". The summer before his senior year, Rowe took part in the ABCD Camp, where he got injured. In his senior year at Traditional, Rowe won the 1996 Class C state title and was an all-state first team selection. That year he averaged 24 points, 6 rebounds, 8 assists and 5 steals per game, and shot 58% from the field; he also recorded a quadruple double with 36 points, 13 rebounds, 10 assists and 11 steals in a game against Lafayette High School. The \"Racine Journal Times\" mentioned him as one of top 100 seniors in the nation. He and Winn again shared \"Buffalo News\" Player of the Year honors. Rowe was the first player in the state of New York to score more than 2,000 points and record more than 1,000 assists. He finished his career at Buffalo Traditional with a school record 2,286 points (some other sources state 2,327), 1,098 assists and more than 500 rebounds and 500 steals. He ranks among the best scorers in the history of New York state high school basketball and according to the National Federation of State High School Associations his 1,098 career assists are the 10th highest mark in U.S. high school basketball history.\nIn 2009 as \"The Buffalo News\" celebrated 50 years of All-Western New York (WNY) basketball selections, Rowe, who was thrice an All-WNY first team selection was a third team selection for the All-time All-WNY team along with Gary Bossert, Jonny Flynn, Aaron Curry, and Jimmy \"Bug\" Williams.\nCollege career.\nRowe drew marginal interest by big Division I programs, and received generic letters by Duke and Michigan. He was recruited by Marquette and Loyola (MD); he decided to sign for Loyola in early November 1995, and chose to major in elementary education. Coach Brian Ellerbe, who had recruited Rowe, included him in the starting lineup since the beginning of the season, and he started all 27 games. Rowe averaged 13.7 points, 3.2 rebounds and 4.1 assists, was the best assistman on the team, and he was the third best scorer behind junior guard Mike Powell and senior forward Anthony Smith. Rowe was a candidate for the MAAC Rookie of the Year award, which went to Ricky Bellinger of Saint Peter's, and led the MAAC freshmen in assists, steals and 3-point field goals.\nFor Rowe's sophomore season Ellerbe left the team, being replaced by Dino Gaudio. On December 13, 1997 Rowe recorded a career-high 10 assists against Towson. On January 4, 1998 Rowe recorded 7 steals against Saint Peter's, one of the best marks in school history. On January 25, 1998, Rowe converted 7 three-pointers, which at the time was tied for the highest in a single game in Loyola history. Rowe improved his scoring average to 18.1 points per game, which ranked second on the team and on the entire MAAC conference, behind teammate Mike Powell. He also led the conference in total steals (86) and steals per game (3.1), while he ranked second in assists to Siena guard Melvin Freeny. His 3.1 steals per game ranked 4th in the entire Division I. His 152 total assists in '98 were among the top-5 in school history, while his 86 steals were a new school record. At the end of the season he was named in the All-MAAC Second Team.\nIn his junior season, Rowe was considered one of the best players of the MAAC, and led his team in points, assists and steals per game, recording 161 total assists (among the best result in Loyola history) and established Loyola's all-time high for steals in a single season with 95. He played 956 total minutes, for a 34.1 per game average. His 3.4 steals per game also ranked third in the whole Division I, behind Shawnta Rogers' 3.6 and Tim Winn's 3.5. Rowe tied his career high in assists with 10 on November 28, 1998 against Kent State. He also recorded his career-high in points per game with 21.9, and led the MAAC in assists per game (5.8) and steals per game (3.4). At the end of the year, Rowe was an All-MAAC First Team selection.\nRowe's senior season saw him starting well: on November 20, 1999 he recorded 8 steals against UMBC, and on January 5, 2000 Rowe again tied his career high in assists with 10 against Canisius. On January 28, 2000, Rowe was expelled by the academic board of Loyola for poor academic performance, after his grade-point average had fallen in the previous weeks. This effectively ended Rowe's career in college basketball; he retired as the top 3-point shooter in Loyola history with 186 3-point field goals made (the record has since been surpassed and Rowe is 5th as of 2019). His 486 total assists were the second-best mark at Loyola, while his 272 steals are an all-time record at Loyola; the record still stands as of 2019. He also scored 1,678 total points, which at the end of his career were the 5th best mark in school history. The Loyola Greyhounds list Rowe's total career points at 1,703.\nProfessional career.\nAfter his senior year of college, Rowe was automatically eligible for the 2000 NBA draft: he had drawn NBA interest in his junior year of college, but was not selected in the draft. He was drafted in the 2000 USBL draft (74th overall) by the Washington Congressionals, but did not sign for the team and instead went to Cyprus, making his professional debut in the Cyprus Basketball Division A. In 2001 he joined Elitzur Ashkelon of the Israeli Basketball Premier League, where he averaged 18.7 points, 2.9 rebounds and 3 assists over 18 games. Later in 2001 he signed for Spójnia Stargard, a team of the Polish Basketball League: Spójnia Stargard had issues paying his salary, and Rowe left the team after 5 games during which he had averaged 11.2 points, 4 rebounds and 3.2 assists. For the 2001–02 season he played for ALM Évreux in the LNB Pro B, the second level of French basketball, and averaged 21 points, 4.3 rebounds and 8.3 assists, shooting 55.2% from the field (42.9% on three-pointers). He also had a brief stint at Independiente de General Pico in the Argentine Liga Nacional de Básquet: in 10 games he averaged 24.2 points, 3.3 rebounds and 5.4 assists, shooting 39% from three.\nIn 2002 he signed for BCM Gravelines, making his debut in the LNB Pro A, France's top league. He also had the chance to play at international level, and appeared in 2 games of the 2002–03 ULEB Cup, averaging 7.5 points, 3 rebounds and 2.5 assists in 21.5 minutes per game. He also played 4 Pro A games, averaging 6.8 points. In 2003 he joined Hyères-Toulon Var (HTV), and played 29 games in the 2003–04 season, averaging 19.5 points and 6.8 assists per game; in the following season he slightly improved his scoring average to 19.6 points over 32 appearances, shooting 36.5% from three. In 2005–06 Rowe had his best season in Pro A: he scored 21 points per game, and added 3.5 rebounds and 6.6 assists, shooting 37.2% from behind the arc and 80.8% on free throws. He was the top scorer of the league, and was also named the LNB Pro A Foreign MVP.\nAfter his MVP performance in France Rowe signed for Basket Livorno, a team of the Italian Serie A. He played 25 games (34.2 minutes per game), and posted averages of 15 points, 2.6 rebounds and 3.9 assists (which ranked 4th in Serie A behind Michael-Hakim Jordan, Terrell McIntyre and Randolph Childress). After his season in Livorno Rowe went back to France, and signed for JDA Dijon, where he was preferred to Lee Humphrey. After 6 games for Dijon Rowe left the team and signed for P.A.O.K., a team of the Greek Basket League. In the 2007–08 season Rowe appeared in 12 games, averaging 9.6 points and 3.8 assists. He then spent two seasons with Dinamo Sassari of LegaDue, the second level of Italian basketball. In his first season he averaged 19.2 points and 4.9 assists, while in the following season his averages decreased to 17.7 points and 4.3 assists. In 2010 his team earned the promotion in Serie A, and Rowe was also named MVP of the LegaDue Italian Cup.\nIn 2010 he left Italy for Turkey and joined Tofaş S.K. of Bursa, in the Turkish Basketball League. He played 30 games with the team, and averaged 13.2 points, 3 rebounds and 4.6 assists per game. He then went back to Italy and played for Veroli Basket in LegaDue; he left the team in December and was replaced by B. J. Elder. In February 2012 he signed for BC Odesa of the Ukrainian Basketball SuperLeague, and played 12 games with the team during the 2011–12 season (12.4 points, 5.1 assists). He joined Greek team KAOD in January 2013 and appeared in 12 games before leaving the team. In 2013 he was signed by Liga ACB side CB Valladolid, and he played 18 games in the 2013–14 ACB season, with averages of 8.4 points, 2.1 rebounds and 3.6 assists. He was named ACB Player of the Week on week 7. After a brief stint at AS Salé of Morocco, Rowe retired after the 2014–15 season, spent in the Nationale Masculine 1 (third level of French basketball) with UB Chartres Métropole.\nCoaching career.\nRowe has been head coach at Bishop Timon – St. Jude High School since July 2017.

        "title": "1989 Georgetown vs. Princeton men's basketball game",
        "text": "On March 17, 1989, during the first round of the 1989 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, the Georgetown University Hoyas played a college basketball game against the Princeton University Tigers at Providence Civic Center in Providence, Rhode Island. The Hoyas, who were seeded first in the East regional bracket, faced the Tigers, who were seeded 16th in the East.\nThe Hoyas, who were strong favorites, won by an unexpectedly narrow margin of 50–49, only securing their win by preventing a Princeton basket on the final possession of the game. Had Princeton won, they would have been the first 16-seed in tournament history to defeat a 1-seed, a feat that was not achieved until UMBC upset Virginia in 2018.\nMedia outlets have dubbed the Georgetown–Princeton match-up as \"the game that saved March Madness\". The game is credited with halting discussions to downsize the NCAA tournament by eliminating automatic bids for smaller conferences. It also reportedly factored into CBS's decisions to renew their NCAA contract later that year, and to obtain exclusive broadcasting rights for the first-round games two years later.\nBackground.\nGeorgetown entered the NCAA tournament with a 22–4 regular-season record, and a roster that included future NBA stars such as Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo. They earned an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament by winning the Big East regular season and tournament titles, and were ranked second in both major polls.\nPrinceton came into the tournament with a 17–7 regular season record. They earned an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament by winning the Ivy League championship. In the three previous NCAA tournaments, the Ivy League representative had lost by an average of 40 points. Princeton was a 23-point underdog.\nThe matchup of Georgetown and Princeton was the very first game shown during the selection show, the televised event wherein the seeding and first-round games are announced. The game was set to take place at the Providence Civic Center in Providence, Rhode Island.\nBroadcast.\nAlthough CBS was the primary TV broadcaster of the 1989 tournament, the Georgetown–Princeton game was carried by ESPN. CBS had other programming lined up for primetime on Thursday and Friday of the tournament's opening weekend, and thus limited their first round coverage to the late-night slots. ESPN was left with 14 games across Thursday and Friday to pick from for their national coverage. The decision to air the Georgetown–Princeton game has been attributed to Tom Odjakian, who was in charge of ESPN's college basketball programming at the time. Interviewed in a 2015 documentary, Odjakian said he chose the game because he believed it had a higher ceiling for ratings in the unlikely event that it was a close game.\nRon Perry and Mike Gorman provided game commentary out of Providence Civic Center. From ESPN's studio, John Saunders and Dick Vitale provided color commentary and coverage of other tournament games before and after the game and during halftime. During the pre-game show, Vitale told Saunders \"If Princeton can beat Georgetown, I'm going to hitchhike to Providence, which isn't that far from here. I'm going to be their ball boy on their next game and then I'm going to change into a Princeton cheerleading uniform. I'm going to lead all the cheers. 'Let's go Tigers. Let's go Tigers.'\"\nAs the first half ended with Princeton leading by 8, Saunders and Vitale expressed their shock during ESPN's halftime coverage, with Saunders opening with the remark, \"I guess 'speechless' would be the way to describe us here.\" After the game, Vitale wore a Princeton sweatshirt and praised the underdog's performance, remarking, \"That would have been the greatest upset in the history of the NCAA tournament.\"\nGame summary.\nPrinceton led Georgetown for most of the first half, and led 29–21 at halftime. Georgetown never held a lead until a basket by forward Sam Jefferson gave them a 39–37 lead with 10:25 to play in the second half.\nThe game remained close to the very end. With seconds left, Alonzo Mourning sunk a free throw to give Georgetown the 50–49 lead. With 15 seconds remaining, Princeton senior Bob Scrabis attempted a three-pointer but was blocked by Mourning, sending the ball out of bounds. Kit Mueller received the inbound pass with one second left to attempt a final shot, but Mourning executed another successful block as time expired.\nAftermath.\nAs the NCAA tournament uses a single-elimination bracket, the Princeton Tigers were eliminated and their season was over. The Georgetown Hoyas advanced to the second round to face the 9th seeded Notre Dame Fighting Irish, who had defeated the 8th seeded Vanderbilt Commodores that same day to advance. The Hoyas went on to defeat the Fighting Irish in the second round and the 5th seeded NC State Wolfpack in the regional semifinals, before falling to the 2nd seeded Duke Blue Devils in the East regional final.\nLegacy.\n\"Sports Illustrated\" and \"Time\" have called it \"the game that saved March Madness\". Prior to this near-upset, the NCAA had been considering eliminating automatic tournament bids for smaller conferences such as Princeton's Ivy League; this game is widely credited with halting those discussions.\nAiring in primetime on ESPN, the game garnered strong ratings, which drew the attention of network executives. The game is reported to have played a role in CBS's decision later that year to sign a new seven-year contract. Starting with the 1991 tournament two years later, CBS took over broadcasting responsibilities for all games from the first round."

While the plans got so far as hiring a contractor to begin designing the building, the Bulldogs would still have to use the temporary Yale Arena for the 1913–14 season, which had been improved by the addition of artificial ice.\nThe Arena was ready for its first practice on January 20 and just four days later, Yale hosted its first game against the St. Nicholas Hockey Club. Work was still being done on the Arena when the Elis welcomed Princeton to New Haven and gave the Tigers all they had. Yale scored first and held the powerful Princeton offence off the scoresheet in the first half, then extended their lead in the second. In the final five minutes Princeton scored twice to tie the game. The two teams agreed to play two 5-minute overtimes and, after Princeton score twice more in the first extra session, Yale began a furious attack but all shots were repelled and the Bulldogs fell 3–5.\nYale lost their next match to Dartmouth, also in double overtime, leaving the team hungry for a win against arch-rival Harvard. Yale was at a disadvantage with the game being in Boston, but the team still battled their foes to a draw after both halves. Once more two overtimes were ordered but it was Harvard who scored in the first and then relied on their oppressive defense to keep the lead, resulting in a 4–3 victory for the Crimson. The rematch was just days later back in New Haven and that time it was Yale's defense that won the day. Both goaltenders were stellar throughout the match but it was Yale's offense that proved superior. The Elis scored three goal to Harvard's one and set up a rubber match at the end of February.\nThe win over Harvard appeared to buoy the spirits of the team and it rolled off three consecutive wins over the next ten days. The victories sent Yale into their final confrontation with Harvard at the end of the month with pride at stake. With Princeton having already wrapped up the Intercollegiate championship the two teams could focus solely on defeating one another. Harvard got off to a fast start, scoring just 29 seconds into the game. Yale tried to return the favor but the Crimson defense held them back. The Elis managed only one goal in the game while Harvard's four gave them the season series.\nYale was able to tack on a game against Massachusetts Agricultural College to give themselves one official home game before the rematch against Harvard. Yale scored first and led at the half but, similar to the Princeton game, Harvard scored three goals and dominated the period. The Elis closed the gap with less than a minute to play but they could not stop Harvard from claiming the Intercollegiate title.\nFor the first time since 1901, Yale didn't end their season against Harvard, instead playing one more home game and winning against a local club team.\nThomas Daniels served as team manager.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#00356B\" | Regular Season"

The Lions followed that up with a miraculous victory over Dartmouth; the greens jumped out to a 3–0 lead after the first half but the offence came alive in the second half. With Bates leading the way, Columbia scored five times and won 5–4, giving the Lions hope that they could finally break through for a championship.\nThe next game came against Princeton with the championship in the balance. While Yale had yet to play a game, Harvard had left the league, leaving the match between Columbia and Princeton as the deciding contest. Unfortunately the Tigers boasted the best player in college hockey and Hobey Baker led Princeton to a 6–3 victory. Bates was again a force for the Lions, recording a hat-trick, but the Tiger's offense was just too much to overcome. Columbia ensured themselves of a second-place finish when they defeated Yale in February and, despite losing the championship, the Lions were encouraged with the growth of the program over the previous two seasons.\nAn ill omen came later as despite possessing a good schedule, there was so little interest in the freshman hockey team that it was disbanded in mid-February.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

After his playing career, Connolly served as a head football coach with his most notable tenure being that as head coach at Xavier University.\nEarly life.\nConnolly was born in Norwalk, Connecticut, in 1920 and attended Norwalk High School. He played high school football at Norwalk under Frank Leahy, who coached on a part-time basis while serving as the line coach at Fordham University. When Leahy became the head coach at Boston College, he recruited Connolly to play for him there. \nCareer.\nConnolly followed Leahy and played college football for the Boston College Eagles from 1940 to 1942. He was a versatile player known for his speed as a runner, passing ability, kicking, and also his propensity for intercepting passes on defense. In November 1942, \"The Boston Globe\" called him \"B. C.'s best all-round athlete, most versatile football player\".\nConnolly was selected by the Steagles in the fifth round (37th overall pick) of the 1943 NFL Draft, but he never played in the NFL. Instead, he served in the Navy during World War II. He was assigned to the North Carolina Pre-Flight Cloudbusters football team.\nAfter the war, Connolly played in the All-America Football Conference for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1946. He appeared in three games, two of them as a starter, and rushed for 18 yards on eight carries and completed two passes for 29 yards.\nAfter his playing career, Connolly became a coach at the high school and college level.

        "text": "An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each team position—who in turn are given the honorific \"All-America\" and typically referred to as \"All-American athletes\", or simply \"All-Americans\". Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. The 2020 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that include All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), the \"Sporting News\" (TSN), and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) for the 2019–20 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. All selectors choose three teams, while AP also lists honorable mention selections.\nThe Consensus 2020 College Basketball All-American team was determined by aggregating the results of the four major All-American teams as determined by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Since United Press International was replaced by TSN in 1997, the four major selectors have been the aforementioned ones. AP has been a selector since 1948, NABC since 1957 and USBWA since 1960. To earn \"consensus\" status, a player must win honors based on a point system computed from the four different all-America teams. The point system consists of three points for first team, two points for second team and one point for third team. No honorable mention or fourth team or lower are used in the computation. The top five totals plus ties are first team and the next five plus ties are second team.\nAlthough the aforementioned lists are used to determine consensus honors, there are numerous other All-American lists. The ten finalists for the John Wooden Award are described as Wooden All-Americans. The ten finalists for the Senior CLASS Award are described as Senior All-Americans. Other All-American lists include those determined by USA Today, Fox Sports, Yahoo! Sports and many others. The scholar-athletes selected by College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) are termed Academic All-Americans.\nIndividual All-America teams.\nBy team.\nAP Honorable Mention:\nAcademic All-Americans.\nThe College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) announced its 15-member 2020 Academic All-America team on March 9, 2020, divided into first, second and third teams with Skylar Mays of LSU chosen as men's college basketball Academic All-American of the Year.\nSenior All-Americans.\nThe 10 finalists for the Senior CLASS Award, called Senior All-Americans, were announced on February 5, 2020. On March 31, Markus Howard was announced as the recipient, with the first and second teams also announced at that time."

        "text": "\"The Fighting Cricket\" () is a short story by Pu Songling first published in \"Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio\". Set in a society whose emperor has an obsession with fighting crickets, the story follows a boy who metamorphoses into one such cricket to save his father.\nPublication history.\nThe story was originally titled \"Cuzhi\" () and first appeared in Pu Songling's anthology of supernatural tales, \"Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio\" (\"Liaozhai\") published in 1740. It was first translated into English as \"The Fighting Cricket\" by the British sinologist Herbert A. Giles and was included in his 1880 translation of \"Strange Tales\". It reappeared with modifications in a subsequent edition, published in 1908. \nInspiration.\nCricket fighting was commonplace during the Qing dynasty which Pu lived in, with established clubs in the more developed cities like Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. Pu evidently drew some inspiration from the Ming dynasty guidebook to Beijing titled \"A Brief Guide to Sights in the Capital\", having published a condensed version of it with a foreword of his own. Technical details found in \"A Brief Guide\", like the diet of a cricket and the different types of cricket, are incorporated in Pu's short story, while other phrases in the guidebook are copied verbatim. Pu's \"connoisseurship\" and the influence of specialised handbooks on him can also be seen in another \"Strange Tales\" story titled \"A Strange Matter Concerning Pigeons\" which revolves around pigeons instead of crickets. \nThemes and analysis.\nAdrian Hsia argues that in \"The Fighting Cricket\", Pu is rallying against the unfair treatment of the peasants that he would have personally witnessed: \"The fighting cricket is a sign of the inhuman exploitation through taxes which can destroy every family.\" He likens the story to \"The Metamorphosis\" by Franz Kafka, pointing out that both works \"create, through their animal figures, an artistic world which is parallel to the human world\" while adding that the \"affinity\" between the two stories was \"striking\" to Chinese critics."

The reigning World Champion was Enzo Lefort of France. \nQualification.\nA National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to 3 qualified fencers in the men's foil. Nations were limited to three fencers each from 1928 to 2004. However, the 2008 Games introduced a rotation of men's team fencing events with one weapon left off each Games; the individual event without a corresponding team event had the number of fencers per nation reduced to two. Men's foil was the first event this applied to, so each nation could enter a maximum of two fencers in the event in 2008. Foil would have been affected by this system again in 2020, but the 2020 Games eliminated this rotation and all weapons had team events.\nThere are 34 dedicated quota spots for men's foil. The first 24 spots go to the 3 members of each of the 8 qualified teams in the team foil event. Next, 6 more men are selected from the world rankings based on continents: 2 from Europe, 1 from the Americas, 2 from Asia/Oceania, and 1 from Africa. Finally, 4 spots are allocated by continental qualifying events: 1 from Europe, 1 from the Americas, 1 from Asia/Oceania, and 1 from Africa. Each nation can earn only one spot through rankings or events.\nAdditionally, there are 8 host/invitational spots that can be spread throughout the various fencing events. Japan has used 2 host places to complete a men's foil team (it had 1 place through individual qualifying).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic delayed many of the events for qualifying for fencing, moving the close of the rankings period back to April 5, 2021, rather than the original April 4, 2020. All of the events that are considered for the men's team foil rankings had been finished before the pandemic caused postponements, however, so the men's teams were known over a year before the event. This meant that the NOCs qualifying 3 fencers for the individual event were known as well: the United States, France, Italy, Russia, Hong Kong, Egypt, Canada, and Germany. The remaining 10 spots based on rankings and continental events remain open until April 2020, as well as whether Japan will use host places in the men's foil (and how many).\nCompetition format.\nThe 1996 tournament had vastly simplified the competition format into a single-elimination bracket, with a bronze medal match. The 2020 tournament will continue to use that format. Fencing is done to 15 touches or to the completion of three three-minute rounds if neither fencer reaches 15 touches by then. At the end of time, the higher-scoring fencer is the winner; a tie results in an additional one-minute sudden-death time period. This sudden-death period is further modified by the selection of a draw-winner beforehand; if neither fencer scores a touch during the minute, the predetermined draw-winner wins the bout. Standard foil rules regarding target area, striking, and priority are used.\nSchedule.\nThe competition is held over a single day, Monday, 26 July. The first session runs from 9 a.m. to approximately 4:20 p.m. (when the quarterfinals are expected to conclude), after which there is a break until 6 p.m. before the semifinals and medal bouts are held. Men's foil bouts alternate with the women's sabre event bouts."

Because Japan qualified a women's team through normal team qualification, it did not need to use any host quota places for women's team foil.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic delayed many of the events for qualifying for fencing, moving the close of the rankings period back to April 5, 2021 rather than the original April 4, 2020.\nCompetition format.\nThe 2020 tournament is a single-elimination tournament, with classification matches for all places. Each match features the three fencers on each team competing in a round-robin, with 9 three-minute bouts to 5 points; the winning team is the one that reaches 45 total points first or is leading after the end of the nine bouts. Standard foil rules regarding target area, striking, and priority are used.\nSchedule.\nThe competition is held over a single day, Thursday, 29 July. The first session runs from 10:50 a.m. to approximately 4:25 p.m. (when all matches except the bronze and gold medal finals are expected to conclude), after which there is a break until 6:30 p.m. before the medal bouts are held.\nResults.\n5–8th place classification"

        "text": "The Noosa Surfing Dog Championship, officially called the VetShopAustralia Surfing Dog Championships, is an annual dog surfing contest held in Noosa, Australia as part of the Noosa Festival of Surfing. It was founded in 2012 and is organized by online retailer, VetShopAustralia.\nCompetition.\nThe championship comprises a single, invitational event in which 8 to 10 teams of dogs and humans on stand-up paddle boards compete to win the Best Wave Award. The award is judged on skill, coordination between dog and person, and entertainment value. One of the competing dog owners claims: \"Spike turns from casual family dog into hyper hound when he sees a glimpse of the beach and will no doubt want to get his paws submerged and on the trophy one more time.\"\nThe VetShopAustralia Surfing Dog Championships usually takes place at Noosa Main Beach on the first or second Saturday of March. \nThe VetShopAustralia Surfing Dog Championship is understood to be the only surfing dog championship event in Australia and is reportedly the largest dog surfing event in the world. Other surfing dog events are held in the US and the UK.\nThe Australian event is not related to the Norcal Dog Surfing event &amp; World Championships held in California, USA.\nHistory.\nThe event was first held in 2012 and was called the VetShopAustralia Surfing Dog Spectacular. It has since been held annually as part of the Noosa Festival of Surfing. In 2018, the event was renamed the Surfing Dog Championships in recognition of the increased quality of surfing from the competitors and the competitive nature of the event\n2012.\nThe inaugural VetShopAustralia.com.au Surfing Dog Spectacular took place on Sunday, 11 March 2012 and proved to be the highlight of the Noosa Festival of Surfing opening ceremony, giving former pros and surf legends a run for their money in the popularity stakes. Crowds swarmed as the surf dogs lined up and prepared to show off their doggy surfing skills to the world. The four-legged contestants did not disappoint, with an exciting display of surfing given by each of the furry surfers.\nThe 2012 event was preceded by a Teach Your Dog to Surf Clinic which was hosted by VetShopAustralia.com.au and Chris de Aboitiz of Natural Balance at Noosa, Queensland, Australia.\nNo winner was announced for the 2012 event.\n2013.\nThe VetShopAustralia.com.au Surfing Dog Spectacular had even more woofs and waves when it was held for the second time on 10 March 2013. The 2013 Spectacular marked the second year in a row the competition was held as the opening event of the Noosa Festival of Surfing. Festival organizers were keen to have the doggie surfing stars back again this year after they drew a crowd large enough to rival the spectators of the professional (people) surfing competition.\nThe Surfing Dog Spectacular was again headlined by Chris de Aboitiz, a former tandem surfing world champion and professional dog trainer. Chris combines his two passions by surfing with his three dogs - known affectionately as The Pack. He has spread the word about dog surfing, which is often found to strengthen the bond between pet and owner.\nThe winner of the 2013 Best Wave Award was Paul \"Jonesy\" Jones and Opal Jones with their dog Hugsley.\n2014.\nThe 2014 event was held on Sunday, 9 March to another packed crowd at Noosa Main Beach. Seasoned dog surfer Chris de Aboitiz and his talented pack of surfing dogs, Rama, a Border Collie cross and Murph, an Australian Shepherd, were joined in the water by a stellar cast of furry competitors. Hugsley, a Spanador (Cocker Spaniel x Labrador) and last year's winner of the Best Wave award, was joined in the surf by Patches, a Jack Russell x Fox Terrier x Cattle Dog, Indi, a Border Collie, and northern New South Wales newbies, Pepper, a Staffie x and Kosta, a Bulldog x Mastiff.\nThe winner of the 2014 Best Wave Award was Morgan and Jesse Dittman with their dog Kosta.\n2015.\nThe 2015 event was held on Sunday, 8 March and saw VetShopAustralia partner with GoPro to kit out the dogs in waterproof cameras that captured their unique view from on the board.\nThe winner of the 2014 Best Wave Award was Paul \"Jonesy\" Jones and Opal Jones with their dog Hugsley (two-time champion).\n2016.\nThe winner of the 2016 Best Wave Award was former world champion tandem surfer Chris de Aboitiz with his dogs Rama and Millie.\n2017.\nThe winner of the 2017 Best Wave Award was Caitlin Jones with dog Indi.\n2018.\nThe winner of the 2018 Best Wave Award was Rob with dog Spike.\n2019.\nThe winner of the 2019 Best Wave Award was Chris Oakley with dog Banjo.\n2020.\nThe winner of the 2020 Best Wave Award was Paul \"Jonesy\" Jones, Opal Jones, and Huey Jones with dog Hugsley (three-time champion).\n2021.\nThe winner of the 2021 Best Wave Award was Dan Bleicher with dog Pickles.\n2022.\nThe winner of the 2022 Best Wave Award was Opal Jones and Lilly Shadforth with first time competitor Freddie.\n2023.\nThe winner of the 2023 Best Wave Award was Poppy a Groodle.

The reigning (2019) World Champion was Gergely Siklósi of Hungary.\nQualification.\nA National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to 3 qualified fencers in the men's épée. Nations were limited to three fencers each from 1928 to 2004. However, the 2008 Games introduced a rotation of men's team fencing events with one weapon left off each Games; the individual event without a corresponding team event had the number of fencers per nation reduced to two. Men's épée was the second event this applied to, so each nation could enter a maximum of two fencers in the event in 2012. The 2020 Games eliminated this rotation and all weapons had team events.\nThere are 34 dedicated quota spots for men's épée. The first 24 spots go to the 3 members of each of the 8 qualified teams in the team épée event (France, Italy, Ukraine, Switzerland, South Korea, the United States, the ROC, and China). Next, 6 more men are selected from the world rankings based on continents: 2 from Europe, 1 from the Americas, 2 from Asia/Oceania, and 1 from Africa.

The 2020 tournament continued the use of that format. Fencing is done to 15 touches or to the completion of three three-minute rounds if neither fencer reaches 15 touches by then. At the end of time, the higher-scoring fencer is the winner; a tie results in an additional one-minute sudden-death time period. This sudden-death period is further modified by the selection of a draw-winner beforehand; if neither fencer scores a touch during the minute, the predetermined draw-winner wins the bout. Standard épée rules regarding target area, striking, and priority are used.\nSchedule.\nThe competition is held over a single day, Sunday, 25 July. The first session runs from 9 a.m. to approximately 4:20 p.m. (when the quarterfinals are expected to conclude), after which there is a break until 6 p.m. before the semifinals and medal bouts are held.

Japan used 2 host places to fill its men's sabre team (adding to the 1 place earned through general qualification).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic delayed many of the events for qualifying for fencing, moving the close of the rankings period back to April 5, 2021 rather than the original April 4, 2020.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1996 tournament had vastly simplified the competition format into a single-elimination bracket, with a bronze medal match. The 2020 tournament continued to use that format. Fencing is done to 15 touches or to the completion of three three-minute rounds if neither fencer reaches 15 touches by then. At the end of time, the higher-scoring fencer is the winner; a tie results in an additional one-minute sudden-death time period. This sudden-death period is further modified by the selection of a draw-winner beforehand; if neither fencer scores a touch during the minute, the predetermined draw-winner wins the bout. Standard sabre rules regarding target area, striking, and priority are used.\nSchedule.\nThe competition was held over a single day, Saturday, 24 July. The first session was scheduled to run from 9 a.m. to approximately 4:20 p.m. (when the quarterfinals were expected to conclude), after which there was a break until 6 p.m. before the semifinals and medal bouts were held. Men's sabre bouts alternate with the women's épée event bouts."

Nations were limited to three fencers each from 1928 to 2004. However, the 2008 Games introduced a rotation of women's team fencing events with one weapon left off each Games; the individual event without a corresponding team event had the number of fencers per nation reduced to two. Women's sabre was the second event this applied to, so each nation could enter a maximum of two fencers in the event in 2012. The 2020 Games eliminated this rotation and all weapons had team events.\nThere are 34 dedicated quota spots for women's sabre. The first 24 spots go to the 3 members of each of the 8 qualified teams in the team sabre event.

        "title": "Cornell–Syracuse lacrosse rivalry",
        "text": "The Cornell–Syracuse lacrosse rivalry is an intercollegiate lacrosse rivalry between Cornell Big Red and Syracuse Orange. The two New York state programs are historical lacrosse powers, combining for 23 national titles. Since the creation of the NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship, Cornell and Syracuse have appeared in 40 Final Fours and captured 14 total titles. Syracuse leads the series 66–38–1 through 2020.\nSeries History.\nEarly Years (1920s to 1960s).\nOnly an hour away from each in upstate New York, the two programs first met in 1920 and would meet annually until World War II would halt the matchup in 1943. During this early stretch, both programs experienced streaks of success in the rivalry. Syracuse would win eight of the first nine meetings, including the initial game, a 5 to 3 victory. Each team would maintain five game winning streaks in the 1930s, while Cornell won the last game prior to World War II.\nAfter the Big Red won the 1942 contest in Ithaca, Syracuse would embark on the longest streak in the history of the rivalry, ripping off 16 straight games from 1946 to 1957. A 22–5 victory was the largest in series history at the time, but the following year the narrative flipped.\nCornell Dominance (1958 to 1982).\nCornell would dominate the contest in 1958 and would take five of seven games for its best series stretch since the 1930s. In 1966, the Big Red would win the first of 12 straight meetings against the Orange. During this period, Cornell was one of the top lacrosse programs in the country, capturing three national titles and appearing in six Final Fours. In contrast, under Roy Simmons Jr., Syracuse would only make their first NCAA tournament appearance in 1979. The games were increasingly lopsided during this period; the Big Red won seven by at least ten goals, including a 27 to 4 rout in 1974. Simmons would call the era's Cornell squads \"the finest attack I've ever seen.\" Syracuse would halt the streak with a 1980 victory in Ithaca, but would not truly take back the series until 1983.\nSyracuse's Rise to National Power (1983 to 1999).\nIn the 1983 meeting, #4 Syracuse defeated Cornell en route to its first national title in 26 years. The next nine matchups would feature an unprecedented streak where the winning team was ranked either #1 or #2 on top of the polls. After four consecutive Orange victories, Richard Moran's team would sweep the 1987 meetings, including the first postseason game between in the two. In the 1987 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship, the Big Red would top Syracuse in a thrilling Final Four game by a score of 18–15. The Orange would get revenge the following year, topping unseeded Cornell in the championship game to capture their second NCAA title. Syracuse would dominate the rest of the century, winning four more national titles and the remaining eleven matchups between the two. Cornell would struggle, only making two more tournament appearances, neither time escaping the first round.\nRecent Years (2000 to Present).\nThe 21st century brought renewed energy, as under third-year head coach Dave Pietramala, the Big Red would return to the tournament after a successful 2000 season, headlined by a 13–12 victory over the Orange in Ithaca. With Jeff Tambroni taking the helm in 2001, Cornell would return to the ranks of the nation's elite and restore balance to the series. The rivalry reached a new crescendo in 2009, as the two teams meet in Foxborough to decide the national title. In an instant classic, Syracuse nabbed its 11th national title with a 10–9 overtime defeat of the Big Red, their second victory over the team in a championship game. After forcing a turnover with 27.6 seconds remaining in the game, Cornell seemed poised for their fourth national title until Kenny Nims stripped the ball and finished the break with four seconds left to force an extra period. In overtime, Syracuse senior &lt;dfn&gt;Dan Hardy assisted&lt;/dfn&gt; &lt;dfn&gt;Cody Jamieson, who sunk&lt;/dfn&gt; the game-winner to successfully defend the Orange's 2008 crown. Since then, Syracuse has defeated in Cornell in six of the last eleven meetings, in a relatively balanced era for a rivalry driven by long streaks. Recently, Cornell prevailed over the Orange in their fourth postseason game, a 10 to 9 victory in the 2018 First Round. The 2020 contest was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the first year without the annual game since 1978 and only the fifth overall since the series began in 1920.\nRival Accomplishments.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Big Red represent Cornell University in the NCAA's Ivy League.\nCornell began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1898. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Cornell's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2019–20 season."

        "text": "The Tubac Golf Resort and Spa is a historic hotel in Tubac, Arizona, on of what was the Otero Ranch in Santa Cruz County, Arizona. It was opened as a hotel and golf resort in 1959.\nThe resort's buildings include an original hacienda and other ranch buildings, a chapel which is a reproduction of a Spanish mission, and guest haciendas. The prevailing architectural style is Spanish Colonial. Its 18-hole original golf course was designed by golf course architect Robert Lawrence. Another 9 holes were added in 2006. The golf course was a principal setting for the 1996 film \"Tin Cup\", starring Kevin Costner as a dissolute golfer.\nIt has been listed by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as a member of the National Registry of the Historic Hotels of America since 2008.\nOtero Ranch.\nThe Otero Ranch became the largest cattle ranch ever in the state of Arizona. It was formed from land grants, the first being the first land grant in Pimería Alta, to Don Toribio de Otero in 1789. The area became part of the United States in the Gadsden Purchase of 1853. The family learned the cattle ranching business while away during the American Civil War and built up a huge herd of cattle in the following years. While large portions of the ranch were sold off after 1914, the original ranch homestead property was held by the Otero family until 1937. Artifacts remain on the Tubac Golf Resort, including the Otero family home and well.\nTubac Golf Resort.\nThe property was purchased by a group of businessmen including Bing Crosby in 1959, who planned to transform the estate into \"a luxurious holiday retreat. Debuting as the Tubac Golf Resort and Spa, they had meticulously persevered its historical integrity throughout the renovation process. The group of investors even began installing a series of golf fairways onsite, making the resort a one-stop destination for avid golfers.\"\nIn 1988, the resort was purchased by Albert Kaufman and Robert Zukin. The resort attracted golfers nationally, and director Ron Shelton chose to shoot much of his film, \"Tin Cup\", there in the mid-1990s.\nThe property was put up for sale after Kaufman died in 2000. After waiting about two years for a competing sale deal to fall through, developer Steve Allred, representing a group of 20 investors, was able to complete a purchase of the property in 2002. In 2002 \"Allred said that he likely won't alter the layout of the golf course, stressing that changes to the property will mostly come in the form of upgrades rather than drastic overhauls. 'What we are going to do is renovate some of the existing historic buildings that we want to keep and possibly add on to them,' Allred said. 'The history of this area is what we really want to preserve, and we always do everything with a really high level of quality.'\"\nAllred had previously developed the Rancho Manana Gold Club in Cave Creek, Arizona and the 3,000-acre Telluride Ski &amp; Golf Co. in Colorado. He intended to make the resort into a \"destination resort\" for mostly regional customers including those from Mexico.\nA spa was added in 2007 and as of 2018 the property comprised approximately 500 acres."

Although he originally harbored dreams of playing football, Wilson was instead encouraged to play basketball due to his height. He emerged as a star at Central Lafourche as he averaged 30 points per game during his final two seasons and was named Louisiana's Most Valuable Player during his senior season in 1975. With the constant attendance of coaches from major colleges at his games, Wilson was one of the nation's most sought-after prospects and received an estimated 250 athletic scholarship offers.\nAt the end of his high school career, Wilson initially committed to play for the LSU Tigers. A few weeks later, he changed his mind and decided to play for the Division II Nicholls Colonels due to his good relationship with head coach Don Landry and a desire to play close to home for his family. With the Colonels, Wilson led the Gulf South Conference in scoring for four consecutive seasons and was named the conference's Player of the Year twice. He ranks first in total points and fourth in total rebounds for the Colonels program.\nWilson was selected by the Atlanta Hawks as the 38th overall pick in the 1979 NBA draft. During a team practice, he slipped on a wet patch on the court and stretched every major ligament in his knee. Wilson was unable to play to his full potential again and retired in 1980 without having played a game professionally. He returned to his hometown of Raceland, where he gained employment with Bollinger Shipyards and coached youth basketball.\nWilson was inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 2010."

        "text": "The 2021 Masters Tournament was the 85th edition of the Masters Tournament and the first of the men's four major golf championships held in 2021. It was held from April 8–11, 2021, at the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia.\nAfter the 2020 tournament had been postponed to November because of the COVID-19 pandemic and held behind closed doors, the 2021 edition returned to its traditional April dates and admitted spectators, although in reduced numbers and with social distancing measures in place. For the second year in succession, the traditional Par-3 contest was canceled due to these restrictions.\nHideki Matsuyama became the first Japanese male golfer to win a major championship, and the first Asian-born golfer to win the Masters, finishing with a 72-hole score of 278 (−10), one shot ahead of Will Zalatoris.\nField.\nParticipation in the Masters Tournament is by invitation only, and the tournament has the smallest field of the major championships.

His four-shot lead after the first round was tied for second-largest in Masters history. It was Rose's fourth time holding the first-round lead at the Masters, tying Jack Nicklaus for the tournament record.\nDefending champion Dustin Johnson opened with a two-over round of 74, ending his streak of 11 consecutive under-par rounds at the Masters, the longest in tournament history.\nWill Zalatoris, making his Masters debut, eagled the par-5 15th and shot 70 (−2) to share fourth place. Jordan Spieth, the 2015 champion, chipped in for eagle on that hole and finished at one-under, in a tie for eighth place.\nTommy Fleetwood made a hole-in-one at the par-3 16th, the 32nd hole-in-one in the history of the Masters.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, April 9, 2021\"\nJustin Rose was three-over on his front-nine to see his four-shot lead at the beginning of the round disappear. He rebounded, though, with three birdies on the back-nine to shoot an even-par 72 and maintain a one-shot lead after 36 holes.\nMasters rookie Will Zalatoris birdied his final three holes in a round of 68 (−4) to get into a tie for second place with Brian Harman, a shot behind Rose. Jordan Spieth made a 30-foot birdie putt on the 17th and was part of a tie for fourth place at 5-under. Justin Thomas birdied all three holes around Amen Corner and didn't make a bogey until the 18th hole to shoot 67 (−5) and jump into a tie for sixth.\n54 players, scoring 147 (+3) or better, made the cut. Defending champion Dustin Johnson shot a three-over 75 and missed the cut by two strokes. Others to miss the cut included Rory McIlroy, who failed to make the weekend at the Masters for the first time since 2010, as well as 2020 runner-up Im Sung-jae. None of the three amateurs in the field made the cut for the first time since 2015.\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, April 10, 2021\"\nHideki Matsuyama was one-under on his round and two shots off the lead playing the 11th hole when play was halted for 77 minutes by inclement weather. When play resumed, Matsuyama birdied the hole from the trees on the right. He also birdied the par-three 12th before hitting his second shot on the par-five 15th to six feet and making the putt for an eagle. Matsuyama hit his approach at the par-3 16th to four feet for another birdie. After getting up-and-down from over the green on the 18th, Matsuyama carded a seven-under 65 and the only bogey-free round of the week, opening up a four-shot lead entering the final round. He was the first Japanese player to hold the overnight lead after any round at the Masters.\nJustin Rose, leader after the first two rounds, birdied his first two holes to take a three-shot lead. But he made only one more birdie the rest of the round to go with three bogeys and shot an even-par 72 to join a group of four tied for second place. Xander Schauffele birdied the par-5 13th and holed a 61-foot eagle putt on the 15th to shoot 68 (−4). They were joined in second place by Marc Leishman and Masters rookie Will Zalatoris.\nCorey Conners made a hole-in-one on the par-3 sixth hole, the sixth on that hole in Masters history, but three-putted from 30 feet on the 13th after having a chance at an eagle and bogeyed the 14th. He came back with birdies on the 15th and 17th to shoot 68 and sit alone in sixth place, five shots behind. Jordan Spieth made four birdies but also double-bogeyed the seventh in an even-par round; he was six shots back in seventh place. Justin Thomas got within one of the lead after birdies on holes 2 and 3, but fell from contention after hitting his third shot on 13 into the tributary of Rae's Creek and making a triple-bogey 8.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, April 11, 2021\"\nSummary.\nHideki Matsuyama, who led by four shots entering the round, saw his lead cut to just one after he bogeyed the first hole while Will Zalatoris made birdie at the first and second. Matsuyama came back with three birdies on the front-nine and led by as many as six shots on the back-nine.\nXander Schauffele, tied with Zalatoris for second at the start of the day, birdied the seventh and eighth holes, then made four straight birdies from holes 12 to 15 to get within two of Matsuyama. At the par-3 16th, Schauffele hit his tee shot into the water and made triple-bogey, dropping him out of contention. He shot an even-par 72 and finished at 7-under for the tournament, three shots back in a tie for third.\nMatsuyama, meanwhile, bogeyed the par-3 12th after failing to get up-and-down from a greenside bunker. After making a birdie on the par-5 13th when his tee shot ricocheted off a tree back into play, he hit his approach shot on the par-5 15th into the water over the green for another bogey. Zalatoris birdied the hole and left his second shot on the 17th six feet from the flag for another birdie to finish at 9-under following a round of 70. With a two-shot lead and two holes to play, Matsuyama two-putted for par on 17. At the 18th, he hit his second shot into the greenside bunker and missed a five-foot par putt but tapped in for bogey and a one-shot victory at 10-under. With the win, Matsuyama became the first Japanese player to win the Masters and the first Japanese male to win a major championship.\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\""

        "title": "2020 Super League Grand Final",
        "text": "The 2020 Super League Grand Final was the 23rd official Grand Final and championship-deciding game of Super League XXV. The game was won 8–4 by St Helens over their local rivals Wigan Warriors. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was the first Super League Grand Final not held at Old Trafford.\nStadium selection.\nInitially, Old Trafford was confirmed as the venue for the 2020 Super League Grand Final, with the Premier League scheduling Manchester United's tie against Southampton, on the same day, to be played away at St Mary's Stadium in order to allow Old Trafford to accommodate the Grand Final. However with an increasing number of positive COVID-19 tests in rugby league players and match postponements approaching the game, Manchester United and the Super League withdrew from the agreement on 17 October as Old Trafford would be unable to accommodate a change in date with them hosting İstanbul Başakşehir and Paris Saint Germain midweek either side of the Grand Final weekend in the Champions League. On 22 October it was announced that the game would be played at the KCOM Stadium, Hull on Friday 27 November with an 8pm kick-off. Criticism was met with the selection of KCOM as the venue, with some people saying it was a poor attempt to expand rugby league's reach, whereas other were saying it was the most iconic Super League stadium and that stadium selection did not matter as fans were not allowed to attend.\nBackground.\nThe two finalists finished first and second in the regular season with Wigan winning 13 of their 17 games and St Helens 12 out of 17. These league positions earned both clubs byes to the second (semi-final) round of the play-offs and home advantage in their semi-final matches.\nRoute to the final.\nWigan Warriors.\nWigan finished first in the regular season, to claim their first League Leaders Shield since 2012, and a first trophy for head coach, Adrian Lam. In their semi-final they played Hull F.C. the lowest ranked winning team from the elimination finals. Wigan won the match 29–2, with tries from Joe Burgess, Harry Smith, Zak Hardaker, Jake Bibby and Bevan French to reach the grand final, for an 11th time.\nSt Helens.\nReigning and defending champions St Helens finished second in the regular season against Catalans Dragons the higher ranked winning team from the elimination finals. St Helens won the match 48–2, to reach the grand final, for a record 12th time.\nMatch details.\nBoth teams normal kit colours are red and white, but with Wigan having finished higher in the league, they were the 'home team' which meant that they were playing in their normal red and white colours, with St Helens playing in their alternate blue and white kit.\nThe game was the lowest scoring grand final in the history of Super League, but has been described as one of the greatest and most dramatic grand finals.\nIn a game dominated by defences, there was no scoring until the last minute of the first half, when St Helens were awarded a penalty for a shoulder charge by Morgan Smithies on Lachlan Coote. Coote took the kick himself to give St Helens a 2–0 half-time lead. The closest effort to a try had seen Wigan's Zak Hardaker prevented from scoring by five St Helens defenders, when he was held-up over the St Helens goal line after 28 minutes\nThe second half continued in the same fashion, with scoring opportunities limited. St Helens thought they had scored on 55 minutes, when Zeb Taia grounded a kick from James Roby, but referee Chris Kendall disallowed the try for offside, a decision confirmed by video referee Ben Thaler.\nWigan's Jake Bibby finally scored the first try of the game, after 66 minutes when he touched down in the corner. Hardaker's conversion attempt bounced off the crossbar to give Wigan a 4–2 lead. With less than 10 minutes left, St Helens were awarded another penalty as Jackson Hastings was adjudged to have high tackled Theo Fages. Coote made his second successful kick to level the scores up at 4–4. In the 78th minute, Wigan were awarded a penalty when Theo Fages was ruled offside. From just inside the Saints half of the field, Hardaker's kick drifted right of the goalposts, leaving the scores tied. As the game went into its final seconds, Saints winger Tommy Makinson attempted a drop goal, and as the hooter sounded the end of the game, the ball bounced back off the goal post, and bounced into the Wigan in-goal area, where St Helens centre Jack Welsby out-sprinted Wigan fullback Bevan French to score the match winning try."

        "text": "The 2018 Commonwealth Games Athletes Village was an accommodation centre to house all participating athletes, as well as officials and athletic trainers of the 2018 Commonwealth Games. It was located in Southport, Gold Coast.\nDevelopment.\nPriority development areas.\nThe Economic Development Queensland (EDQ), Queensland Government’s specialist land use planning and property development unit, engages with state and local governments to identify areas of land for development within Queensland which are called Priority Development Areas (PDAs). PDAs are planned for development that provides commercial, industrial, residential and/or community development opportunities. The Minister for Economic Development Queensland (MEDQ) declare a PDA under the Economic Development Act 2012 and EDQ manages development projects in some PDAs.\nParklands redevelopment.\nA 29-hectare of area in Parklands which is three kilometres from Southport Central Business District and 3.6 kilometres east of the Pacific Motorway was identified by EDQ and declared as a PDA in 2013. The Parklands PDA was declared to facilitate the Athletes Village for the 2018 Commonwealth Games, which would be leased by the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games Corporation (GOLDOC) during the Games, and later the Gold Coast Health and Knowledge Precinct.\nThe Australian urban design and architecture firm, Archipelago Architects designed the original competition winning entry for the Commonwealth Games bid, and following a series of reference designs produced for cabinet to form an economic position on the project thereafter, Archipelago were appointed by EDQ to complete reference designs to assist in framing the PDA. Archipelago designed the master plan for the redevelopment of Parklands. \nThe design and delivery of the project was undertaken as a joint venture between Archipelago, Arkhefield and ARM Architecture. The project featured 1,252 housing units, comprising 1,170 one and two-bedroom apartments and 82 three-bedroom townhouses over 18 buildings with 8 floors each and a 'village heart' with over 5800 m2 of retail. The Dutch company Arcadis provided engineering inputs into the concept and feasibility phase through to delivery of the Parklands site .\nAustralian company Grocon was appointed to construct the infrastructure of the Parklands project and the construction work commenced in late 2015. Its construction cost was A$550 million over 1800 workers were involved in the site's construction. \nAustralian construction companies BMD Urban and JMac Constructions (JMac) (both belonging to BMD Group), constructed some of the works on the Parklands Project. BMD Urban constructed the community infrastructure in the project at a cost of A$65 million. JMac constructed the village heart at a cost of A$17 million.\nRemodel to athletes village.\nThe site was handed over to the GOLDOC in October 2017 which allowed them to complete its transformation into the Athletes Village for the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Australian property and infrastructure company Lendlease, appointed by GOLDOC, managed the overlay to the Athlete's Village which also included the development of the fully-equipped gymnasium and dining facilities in the Village.\nAwards.\nThe Parklands developments has been recognised extensively for excellence in planning and design: \nFacilities.\nThe Athletes Village was officially opened from 25 March 2018 and provided accommodation and services to 6,600 athletes and officials in 1252 permanent dwellings. There were 1170 one and two-bedroom apartments and 82 three-bedroom townhouses. The village had three zones - International, Residential and Operational.\nThe residential zone accommodated athletes and officials and also offered recreation, gym and medical facilities. The gym was designed by the Australian Institute of Sport and equipment in the gym was sponsored by Technogym. Adjoining the gym was the Athlete Recovery Area.\nThe International Zone consisted of retail services, shops and a self service buffet-style dining hall. The Festival 2018 events were also held in the International Zone. The Dining hall served over 18,000 meals per day to the athletes during the Games. Australian telecommunications company Optus opened a store in the International zone named \"Yes Optus Store\" which provided free calling services to the athletes and officials and other services such as phone charging and watching events of the Games in televisions. Optus also provided free Wifi services in the village. Athletes claimed that the Athletes Village was better than the Olympic Village built for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.\nPost use.\nAll apartments are currently offered for long-term rent generally for tenants from the Griffith University’s Gold Coast campus, Gold Coast University Hospital, Gold Coast Private Hospital and the Southport Central Business District. The complex has been renamed to \"Smith Collective\". BWS and Woolworths also opened their stores in the complex in early 2019."

The league donated $2.5 million to disaster relief funds in association with the match. Selection for the two teams was under state of origin rules – with players of Victorian origin eligible for Victoria, and all other players eligible for the All-Stars – and it was the first interstate representative match featuring AFL-listed players since the AFL Hall of Fame Tribute Match held in 2008.\nTeams.\nOn 18 February the AFL announced 27-player teams for each of the Victoria and All-Stars side. All AFL teams had at least one player selected in one of the sides. The match was played with an extended interchange bench of nine players instead of four.\nThree late changes were made to the side due to injuries between the initial team announcement and the game itself, with Eddie Betts replacing Dayne Zorko in the All-Stars side and Travis Boak and Andrew Gaff replacing Robbie Gray and Ben Cunnington for Victoria.\nDamien Hardwick and John Longmire were the coaches of Victoria and the All-Stars, respectively, and were also primarily responsible for selecting players for their sides.\nRichmond captain Trent Cotchin and Fremantle captain Nat Fyfe were named to captain Victoria and the All-Stars, respectively.\nBest-on-ground award.\nThe best-on-ground medal was awarded to Dustin Martin, who kicked two goals and had 23 disposals for Victoria."

Great Britain has won the last three sprint competitions.\nQualification.\nA National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to 2 qualified cyclists in the men's sprint. Qualification is entirely through the 2018–20 UCI nation rankings. The eight nations that qualify for the team sprint event may enter two cyclists each in the individual sprint (as well as the Keirin). The nations that qualify a cyclist through the Keirin rankings may also enter that cyclist in the sprint. Finally, seven places are allocated through the individual sprint rankings; these places must ensure that each of the five continents are represented. Because qualification was complete by the end of the 2020 UCI Track Cycling World Championships on 1 March 2020 (the last event that contributed to the 2018–20 rankings), qualification was unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCompetition format.\nFor the first time since 2000, the sprint competition format is seeing significant changes. The number of main rounds is increasing from 5 to 6 and the number of repechages from 2 to 3. The competition begins, as usual, with a qualifying round of time trials (flying start 200 metres). The top 24 cyclists in the qualifying round (up from 18) qualify for match rounds. In each match round, the cyclists start side by side and must complete 3 laps of the track (750 metres). The last 200 metres are timed. The match rounds are as follows."

Canadian rider Kelsey Mitchell won gold, with Olena Starikova from Ukraine and Lee Wai-sze from Hong-Kong completing the medal positions.\nThe medals were presented by Yasuhiro Yamashita, IOC member, Olympian, 1 Gold Medal, Japan; and the medalists' bouquets were presented by David Lappartient, President of the UCI, France.\nBackground.\nThis will be the 9th appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics since the introduction of women's track cycling in 1988.\nThe reigning Olympic champion is Kristina Vogel of Germany. The reigning World Champion is Emma Hinze, also of Germany.\nQualification.\nA National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to 2 qualified cyclists in the women's sprint. Quota places are allocated to the NOC, which selects the cyclists. Qualification is entirely through the 2018–20 UCI nation rankings. The eight nations that qualify for the team sprint event may enter two cyclists each in the individual sprint (as well as the Keirin). The nations that qualify a cyclist through the Keirin rankings may also enter that cyclist in the sprint. Finally, seven places are allocated through the individual sprint rankings; these places must ensure that each of the five continents are represented. Because qualification was complete by the end of the 2020 UCI Track Cycling World Championships on 1 March 2020 (the last event that contributed to the 2018–20 rankings), qualification was unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCompetition format.\nFor the first time since 2000, the sprint competition format is seeing significant changes. The number of main rounds is increasing from 5 to 6 and the number of repechages from 2 to 3. The competition begins, as usual, with a qualifying round of time trials (flying start 200 metres). The top 24 cyclists in the qualifying round (up from 18) qualify for match rounds. In each match round, the cyclists start side by side and must complete 3 laps of the track (750 metres). The last 200 metres are timed. The match rounds are as follows."

Quota places are allocated to the NOC, which selects the cyclists. Qualification is entirely through the 2018–20 UCI nation rankings.

The cyclists follow a pace motorcycle for 3 laps (750 m); the motorcycle then pulls away and the cyclists race for another 3 laps. These distances are changed from the 2016 Games, shortening the paced section from 5.5 laps and lengthening the unpaced sprint from 2.5 laps. The motorcycle starts at 30 km/h and increases speed to 50 km/h before it pulls off.\nThe tournament consists of four main rounds (up from three in 2016) and a repechage:\nResults.\nFinals.\nFinal A.\nThe Keirin final was won by Jason Kenny in what would be his last race, riding in position one behind the derny, and taking advantage of the nervous Matthew Glaetzer in second wheel to create a gap of a few bike lengths over the field as the derny prepared to pull off. As Glaetzer held the field up very marginally with his attention on the riders behind him, Kenny then launched a highly unusual and ferocious breakaway attack immediately as the derny left the track, putting half a lap into his rivals before they were fully aware what had happened. Despite a frenzied chase led by Dutch sprint and team sprint gold medalist Harrie Lavreysen, seeking to replicate the sprint 'triple crown' previously won by Kenny in 2016 and Chris Hoy in 2008, Kenny was able to hold off the field, winning the event by the length of a straight. The gold medal made Kenny the most successful British Olympian, and the most successful Olympic cyclist, in history. It also made Kenny one of the elite number of Olympians to have successfully defended an Olympic gold medal in three different events (in Kenny's case, team sprint between 2008 and 2016, sprint between 2012 and 2016 and keirin between 2016 and 2020), the others being Michael Phelps, Ray Ewry, Larisa Latynina, Jenny Thompson and Sawao Kato."

Teams score points in two ways: lapping the field and sprints. A team that gains a lap on the field earns 20 points; one that loses a lap has 20 points deducted. Every 10th lap is a sprint, with the first to finish the lap earning 5 points, second 3 points, third 2 points, and fourth 1 point. The points values are doubled for the final sprint. There is only one round of competition.\nResults.\nWhereas the women's race had been a showcase for one team's complete dominance, the men's race was delicately poised between several teams until the closing laps, with all three medalists separated by only three points, and no team able to take a lap in the entire race. Although they won only 3 of the sprints, Denmark's Lasse Norman Hansen and Michael Mørkøv had, with consistent points finishes, sewn up the gold medal before the final sprint for ten points. This left the final sprint between the British pair of Ethan Hayter and Matthew Walls and the French duo of Benjamin Thomas and Donavan Grondin. The British pair held off all challengers to win silver, claiming the ten points for the final sprint, bringing them level with France on 40 points, but condemning the French to bronze based on finishing position in the final sprint."

Of the theoretically available 65 sprint points, they took 58 - no other team took more than 21.\nBy winning the inaugural women's madison, Laura Kenny completed a hat-trick of inaugural wins, having won (and then defended) the inaugural women's team pursuit and omnium titles in 2012. She also became the first female cyclist, or female British Olympian, to claim five gold medals, making her Great Britain's most successful female Olympian, and the most successful Olympic female cyclist, in history.

        "text": "Fred McLeod (2 May 1939 – 25 December 2019) was a Scottish rugby union player. He became the 110th President of the Scottish Rugby Union.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nMcLeod went to Daniel Stewart's College in Edinburgh. He played rugby for the school team.\nHe then played for Stewart's College FP. He played for the club for 23 years until in 1970 a detached retina forced him to quit his playing career.\nAdministrative career.\nHe became a club selector of Stewart's College FP in 1970.\nWhen Stewart's College FP and Melville College FP merged in 1973 to form Stewart's Melville, McLeod became Secretary of the new club. He later became President of Stewart's Melville.\nIn 1979 he was secretary of the Co-Optimists. He managed them to the final of the Hong Kong Sevens in 1981 and the quarter-finals in 1986. He also took the side on tour to Zimbabwe and later became a President of the Co-Optimists.\nHe was elected to the SRU committee in 1981.\nHe became SRU Vice-President in 1985.\nHe became the 110th President of the Scottish Rugby Union. He served one year from 1996 to 1997.\nHis spell of the Presidency was notable as he had to deal with the new professional era of rugby union in Scotland. Despite the SRU professionalising the District sides, the situation was tense as many still argued that the club sides should be turned professional instead.\nMcLeod was one of the three IRB members that recommended professionalism for the sport in a 1995 report. \"The National\" newspaper concluded: 'Fred got pelters for that around Murrayfield but stood his ground and was proven correct' and also backed Jim Telfer in his view that the District sides should be professional and not the club sides.\nMcLeod also had to deal with England's expulsion from the Five Nations Championship in 1996. This was short-term and England played in the next tournament.\nHe had to step in as SRU chairman in 2005 when the previous chairman David Mackay and chief executive Phil Anderton were forced out of the post. This lasted until the summer of that year when Allan Munro took over as chairman; and Gordon McKie became the chief executive.\nTributes.\nAndy Irvine:\nFreddie was rugby through and through. He was a great servant to the game and I really enjoyed working with him."

When she accompanied a inebriated King to his hotel room, King \"came up behind her, grabbed her, pressed her against his body, and refused to let go of her even though she says she tried to kick and elbow him to get him off her.\" When she got free, he then refused to let her open the door to his room until she received a call from one of the talent managers.\nAfter the incident occurred, Suarez informed production, who then instructed King to sleep on the boat during non-filming days, after originally offering to fire King for his misconduct. Suarez also alleges that she should not have been put in the position she was regarding King's employment on the show, considering the limited agency and power her position on the show provided.\nTwo other production members also commented on King's behavior on set for the story, noting that he touched \"a female cast member’s butt and continue[d] to touch her inappropriately even though she said, “No,” and told him to stop,\" as well as grabbing \"production crew member's genitals\" on two separate occasions while inebriated."

        "text": "Marvin O'Connor (born July 11, 1978) is an American former professional basketball player. He played high school basketball at Simon Gratz in his native Philadelphia, winning the Philadelphia Public League title as a senior in 1997. After his freshman year in college at Villanova, O'Connor transferred to Saint Joseph's, where he was an all-conference selection in all of his three seasons there, and won the Robert V. Geasey Trophy as the best basketball player in the Philadelphia Big 5 in 2001. He went undrafted in the 2002 NBA draft and spent his only professional season with KK Partizan in Serbia, playing in the 2002–03 Euroleague. He is a member of the St. Joseph's Hawks Hall of Fame (inducted in 2008) and of the Big 5 Hall of Fame (2013).\nHigh school career.\nO'Connor was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1978, to Alfred and Alexandria Dockins. He attended Simon Gratz High School, where he was named a starter as a sophomore in 1994–95 by coach Bill Ellerbee. That season, he scored a season-high 20 points against Central. In the following season, his junior year, O'Connor was one of the main players on the team, and was the team's top scorer in 11 out of 14 regular season games in the Philadelphia Public League. He scored a regular season-best 24 points against Roxborough, 29 points in the semifinals against Frankford and 35 points (a then-career high) against Thomas Edison High School. At the end of the season he was named in the All-City Second Team and in the All-Public League First Team after averaging 15.6 points per game in Public League play. Overall, O'Connor averaged 17 points, 9 rebounds and 3 assists per game in a total of 28 games in his junior season.\nIn O'Connor's senior season, he led the team in scoring in 10 out of 16 games during the Public League, including 39 points against Olney (a new career-high), 34 against Fels and 30 against Northeast. During the playoffs, O'Connor scored 22 points in the semifinals against Strawberry Mansion, and 14 points, along with 13 rebounds, in the championship game win against Engineering and Science, which was led by Lynn Greer.

O'Connor scored a total 1,258 points at Simon Gratz.\nCollege career.\nO'Connor was highly recruited in high school and received offers from several NCAA Division I programs, drawing interest from Clemson, Xavier, NC State, Miami (FL), Penn, Penn State, Princeton, Temple, UMass, and Villanova. He signed to play for Villanova in late November 1996. As a true freshman at Villanova, O'Connor found little playing time under coach Steve Lappas, starting 5 out of 21 games, and scoring a season-high 12 points against Temple. At the end of the season he had averages of 4.7 points, 1.7 rebounds and 1.2 assists per game.\nAfter the end of his first season at Villanova, O'Connor decided to transfer to Saint Joseph's. He had to sit out the 1998–99 season due to NCAA transfer rules. He debuted for Saint Joseph's in 1999. Head coach Phil Martelli immediately included O'Connor in the starting lineup, and he averaged 16.6 points, 4.4 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 1.1 steals per game in 31.5 minutes of playing time. He led the team in points per game (16.6), steals with 31 (1.1 average), three-pointers made (73) and ranked second in assists per game behind Tim Brown. He scored in double figures in 25 out of 28 games, being the team's top scorer in 18 of these occasions, and at the end of his first year at Saint Joseph's he was named in the All-Atlantic 10 Third Team and in the All-Big 5 First Team.\nIn O'Connor's junior season he was joined in the backcourt by freshman point guard Jameer Nelson.

On December 11, 2000, O'Connor scored a new career-high 32 points on 11/17 shooting against his former team, Villanova: the game ended with Saint Joseph's losing, 75–78. On March 3, 2001, O'Connor scored 18 points in 57.5 seconds, reaching a new career-high of 37 points in a game against La Salle. The Hawks qualified for the 2001 NCAA tournament, where O'Connor debuted scoring 21 points against Georgia Tech. On March 17, 2000, he scored 37 points (equalling his career high) against Stanford shooting 15/20 from the field, including a perfect 10/10 on 2-point field goals.

In December 2001 he was included in the Midseason Top 30 list for the Wooden Award. He scored at least 10 points in 26 out of 29 games, and in 8 of these he scored more than 20 points. He was the team's leading scorer for the third season in a row and he was named in the All-Atlantic 10 Second Team, the All-Big 5 First Team, and in the NABC All-District First Team. He ended his career at Saint Joseph's with a total of 1,678 points (14th in program history as of 2018) and 231 three-point field goals made, which at the time of his graduation were the highest mark in Saint Joseph's history (4th as of 2018). He started all the 89 games he played with the Hawks.\nIn 2008 he was inducted in the Saint Joseph's Hall of Fame, and in 2013 he was inducted in the Big 5 Hall of Fame.\nProfessional career.\nAfter the end of his senior season at Saint Joseph's, O'Connor was automatically eligible for the 2002 NBA draft.

        "text": "Ivan Stewart (1894–1952) played for the New Zealand rugby league team. He was Kiwi number 119 and played one test, against Australia in 1919. He played for the North Shore Albions after returning from the war in 1917, and then for City Rovers in the Auckland Rugby League competition from 1918 to 1920.\nEarly life and war.\nIvan Stewart was born on 28 August 1894. His mother was Elizabeth Margaret Stewart (1863-1952) and his father was Duncan Stewart (1860-1934). He had three sisters; Kitoria Olivette Stewart (1888-1979), Rita Phillis Stewart (1891-1977), and Edna Marion Stewart (1898-?), and two brothers; James Douglas Stewart (1889-1973), and William Oscar Stewart (1893-1966).\nStewart was a very strong swimmer in his teen years, winning many competitions. He enlisted in the New Zealand army and served in World War I. He had been working in Te Puke but was living with his father on Nelson Street in Auckland at the time of enlistment. He fought in Egypt and the Western Front, where he was wounded before returning to New Zealand and being discharged on 2 April 1917.\nPlaying career.\nIvan Stewart debuted for the City Rovers in round one of the 1918 season. He was part of the team who won the Roope Rooster that same season when they defeated Maritime 6–3 in the final at the Auckland Domain in front of 7,000 spectators. He was named in the reserves to play in the Auckland match with Canterbury but did not take the field.\nNew Zealand debut.\nStewart made his debut for New Zealand on the 1919 tour of Australia. In total he played in 6 of the 11 tour matches. He debuted in the 3rd tour match against Tamworth at halfback alongside the legendary Thomas McClymont. Stewart scored 2 tries in a 21–13 win. These were to be his only points in a New Zealand jersey. He played centre against New South Wales Firsts in a 31–39 loss. And he played there again against the same opponents 2 days later when they again lost 19–22 \nStewart moved back to the halves for the match against Ipswich Firsts which New Zealand won 11–8. Stewart played his fourth and fifth successive matches in 13–26, and 13-16 point losses to Queensland\nAfter the tour of Australia (which involved no test matches) the Australian national team toured New Zealand. Stewart was selected to play for New Zealand against Australia at the Auckland Domain in the 4th test of the series. New Zealand trailed the series 1-2 and lost 32–2 in front of 15,000 spectators with Stewart playing halfback. Stewart would get to play the Australian team again this time for the Auckland Province team made up of players from the Auckland club competition and the wider district although this particular team like most other Auckland Provincial teams in this era was totally dominated by Auckland Rugby League club players. Auckland lost 8–32 which then went on to utterly demolish its remaining provincial opponents by well over 50 points.\nAuckland appearance.\nIn 1920 Stewart played for the Auckland team which beat the touring England side 24–16 at the Auckland Domain in front of an enormous crowd estimated at 30,000.\nRetirement.\nIt is unclear if he continued to play in 1921 or beyond as there are no records of him playing rugby league or any other code in New Zealand.\nPersonal life and death.\nIvan Stewart did not marry and had no children. He died on 4 August 1952 in Auckland aged 58. He was buried at Waikumete Cemetery."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Flyers represent the University of Dayton in the NCAA's Atlantic 10 Conference.\nDayton began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1903. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Dayton's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the conclusion of the 2023–24 season."

        "text": "The Tour de France is an annual men's multiple stage bicycle race primarily held in France, generally considered the most famous bicycle race in the world. It was founded by the French sports journalist and former professional road racing cyclist Henri Desgrange, who became the first director of the race. He was passionate about taking the Tour up to the highest reachable points of elevation in the Alps and Pyrenees using the most difficult routes.\nThe highest point of the first Tour de France in 1903 was the summit of the Col de la République mountain pass in the Mont Pilat area of the Massif Central highland region. The following year the route remained identical, but in 1905 and 1906 the Tour moved into the Alps, in particular the Dauphiné Alps, and up to the Col Bayard at . The 1907 Tour took the race higher, up to with the Col de Porte in the Chartreuse Mountains. This point was again the highest for the next two Tours. \nThe race first reached high altitude on the ninth edition in 1910 when it passed the Col du Tourmalet in the Pyrenees. Not satisfied with that height, Desgrange the following year introduced his favoured Col du Galibier in the Alps, which summited at via a single-laned tunnel that first opened in 1891. At the time, Desgrange eulogised over the Galibier in comparison to the Tourmalet and other climbs, saying: \"Oh Sappey, oh Laffrey, oh Bayard, oh Tourmalet! I will not shirk from my duty in proclaiming that compared to the Galibier you are no more than pale and vulgar babies; faced with this giant we can do no more than tip our hats and bow!\" The Galibier was the highest point of elevation in each Tour to 1937, which led it to become one of the most iconic climbs in the race. The 1938 race went higher up to the Alpine Col de l'Iseran at . Various Alpine passes, including the Galibier, were the highest points reached in Tours until the 1962 race saw a new high of at the Cime de la Bonette in the Alps, a short loop road which forks from the summit of the Col de la Bonette. , this remains the highest point of elevation reached by the Tour de France. Since 1962, all the highest points of Tours bar one have remained above , using passes in the high Alps and Pyrenees."

        "text": "The 1912–13 Yale Bulldogs men's ice hockey season was the 18th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nPrior to the season, Yale, a founding member of the Intercollegiate Hockey Association, withdrew from the league. The Bulldogs' exit was precipitated by the building of the Yale Rink on campus, which meant the team no longer had to travel to find stable ice. League rules required all inter-squad matches to be played at the St. Nicholas Rink or the Boston Arena. Another matter was the disparity in play between the teams. Yale, Princeton and Harvard were widely considered as the cream of college hockey, with each competing for the championship year after year, while the remaining teams would rarely demonstrate an equivalent level of play. Rather than be forced into matches that would not enhance Yale's record, the Elis wanted to play the Canadian universities more often and buoy its reputation.\nAfter an agreement between Yale, Princeton and Harvard to play best-of-three series against one another, the Intercollegiate Hockey League was tentatively formed. Yale, however, could hardly have picked a worse season to declare itself among the college hockey elite as it failed to defeat St. Paul's School, a prep school in its opening game. Yale dispensed with its usual winter break trip and instead played a single game against McGill. While the team performed far better than they had in their first contest they did fall to the Canadian club.\nAfter returning from the break, Yale scheduled 10 games for the remainder of their season, with a majority taking place at the Yale Rink. In their first game the Elis appeared to have righted the ship by downing Columbia 6–0, though the game had to be played on the road instead of New Haven. the Yale Rink did not provide the stable ice the team hoped it would; the match against MIT was called off due to no ice at the rink which also caused the first game against Princeton, originally scheduled for the 13th, to be pushed to later in the year. A third home game against Toronto was also cancelled.\nYale had to travel to the St. Nicholas Rink for their next game and despite missing out on three games, the Elis gave Princeton a tough fight. After opening the scoring, Yale found itself down by two goals early in the second half. A furious effort by Yale saw the team score four times in the span of four minutes and take a 5–4 lead late in the match. Unfortunately, 17 seconds before regulation ended, Princeton tied the game and then scored twice in overtime to take the first game of the series. A fifth home contest, this time versus Cornell, was cancelled and left the Elis without a home game for the entire month of January.\nThe team returned to the ice in February when they travelled to Boston for the first game against Harvard. Yale could not, however, field its normal lineup as several players were missing due to illness or injury. The result was that the Elis could hardly make a dent in the stout Harvard defense and fell 0–4 to the Crimson. The shot total of 34 to 6 in favor of Harvard demonstrates how lopsided the match was.\nTwo further home games were cancelled with the second being moved to the St. Nicholas Rink, where Yale fell to Dartmouth 2–3. The next day the Elis were finally able to play at home, defeating the Freshman team in an exhibition match. The second match against Princeton began well for the Bulldogs with Yale leading 1–0 at the half. The second half, however, was a nightmare for the Elis. Princeton scored 8 goals, four coming from Hobey Baker, as the defense was swamped and Yale was soundly beaten 8–2.\nYale was able to tack on a game against Massachusetts Agricultural College to give themselves one official home game before the rematch against Harvard. Yale scored first and led at the half but, similar to the Princeton game, Harvard scored three goals and dominated the period. The Elis closed the gap with less than a minute to play but they could not stop Harvard from claiming the Intercollegiate title.\nThe team did not have a coach, however, Alfred Cowles served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#00356B\" | Regular Season"

The men's basketball tournament for the school year 2007-08 began on July 7, 2007 and the host school for the season was also UST.\nThe Tigers, the Season 69 champions, ended the double round-robin eliminations in joint fourth place with the FEU Tamaraws with eight wins and six losses. They then won over FEU in the playoff for the fourth and final semifinal slot. UST held the Tamaraws to a season-low of 6 points in the second quarter. They were eliminated by the Ateneo Blue Eagles in a knockout game of the first round of the stepladder Semifinals for the right to face the second-seeded De La Salle Green Archers in the second round.\nUST suffered back-to-back losses at the start of the season but recovered by winning four of their next five games to finish the first round at third place with a 4–3 record.\nTwo of their games went into overtime and were both against La Salle who had rejoined the league after serving a one-year suspension in Season 69 for fielding ineligible players in the past three years.. The first was an 86–90 first round loss and the other was an 81–73 win. They have defeated the Green Archers for the first time since the 1999 Finals where the Tigers lost in a three-game series with Game Three also going into overtime.\nJervy Cruz was named Most Valuable Player of the season. He topped the statistical points tally with 75.9 at the end of the second round of eliminations on top of 11 double-doubles that included two playoff games. The last UST player to win the MVP was Chris Cantonjos in 1995. Cruz was third in the league in scoring with an average of 16.7 points per game behind the 21.3 average of Adamson's Patrick Cabahug and the 17.6 points per game of NU Bulldogs' Edwin Asoro. He led the league in rebounds with a 15.4 per game average.\nFrancis Allera was chosen Player of the Week by the UAAP Press Corps for the duration of July 19–22, while Khasim Mirza received the citation twice on the weeks of August 2–5 and 23–26.\nIneligibility issues.\nJojo Duncil, the Finals MVP of last year's championship series has announced to the team his decision to turn professional and forego his last playing year in the collegiate ranks.\nIt was revealed on July 2 during the press conference for the upcoming UAAP Season 70 by Institute of Physical Education and Athletics (IPEA) director Fr. Ermito de Sagon that Duncil's age eligibility was being questioned by other member schools after it was discovered that Duncil had two NSO certificates that showed varying data. One birth certificate had 1983 as Duncil's year of birth while another had shown that he was born in 1982.\nAccording to Fr. de Sagon of the season's host school, the team decided to exclude him from the roster to avoid future games being put under protest which can only cause distraction to the rest of the team. De Sagon added that Duncil, being the rector's nephew is undoubtedly only 24 years old and is eligible to play this season.\nSchedule and results.\nPreseason tournaments.\nThe Nike Summer League and the Filoil Flying V Preseason Invitational Cup games were aired on Studio 23.\nUAAP games.\nElimination games were played in a double round-robin format and all of UST's games were televised on Studio 23."

        "title": "Bill Williams (rugby league)",
        "text": "Bill Williams (1899 – 21 November 1927) was Kiwi number 123. He played in 4 test matches for New Zealand debuting in 1919 and last playing for them in 1921. Williams played for the Newton Rangers club in Auckland from 1915 to 1924.\nEarly life.\nWilliam (Billy) Williams was born on February 7, 1898, in Karangahake, Ohinemure, Waikato. His father was also named William Williams (b.1870-1945) and his mother Emma (Ella) Josephine Houghton (1875-1934). He had an older brother, Stanley Williams (b.1896-1944), and two younger brothers, Morris Andrew Williams (b.1906-1974), and Bernard Clive Williams (b.1915-1939).\nPlaying career.\nWilliams was a forward and made his debut for the Newton Rangers senior team in 1915 aged just 16. Though in his initial games he played on the wing. With so many men going away to fight in the war the senior ranks became populated by very young players and older players as teams struggled to continue to field sides. Auckland played very few representative matches during the war years and he wasn’t to debut for Auckland until 1918. He played in a trial match on 7 September to help pick the Auckland side. He was then picked for the Auckland team and was part of the 45–9 win over Canterbury played at the Auckland Domain in front of 10,000 spectators.\nIn 1919 Williams had a very busy season. He played in a New Zealand trial match on 14 May and was part of the A Team which lost 14–15. He was subsequently selected for the New Zealand team to tour Australia. On 24 May he made his New Zealand debut in a match against Auckland prior to the teams departure for Australia. New Zealand won the match 25–19.\nWilliams was to play in 10 of the 11 tour matches which along with Stan Walters was the most of any of the touring 22. He played in 4 losses to New South Wales (18–23, 9–20, 31–39, and 19–22), 2 losses to Queensland (13–26, 13–16) and wins over Tamworth (21–13), Northern Division (11–8), Rockhampton (23–0), and Toowoomba (42–14). He scored twice in the thrashing of Toowoomba which was the final match of the tour. He played in the second row in all the matches aside from the wins over Tamworth and Northern Division where he played at hooker.\nA month later the Australian side was to tour New Zealand playing 9 matches including 4 tests. Williams was to become very familiar with the tourists after he played in all 4 tests and a match for Auckland against them.\nWilliams test debut came in the 21–44 defeat at the Basin Reserve in Wellington in front of 8,000 spectators. A week later Williams was part of the victorious New Zealand team in the second test with New Zealand winning 26–10 at Sydenham Park, Christchurch in front of 7,200 fans. Williams scored the first try early in the match after taking a pass from Karl Ifwersen and scoring near the corner. The third test was played in Auckland and Williams played in front of 20,000 spectators at the Auckland Domain. New Zealand went down 23–34. Williams was to play his final test match for New Zealand in the 4th test once again at the Auckland Domain. New Zealand was completely outplayed by the Australians who won by 32 points to 2 in front of 15,000. Following the match Williams was selected to play for Auckland against Australia. For this match Williams moved into the front row but again had a hard time of it with Auckland defeated 8–32 in front of a crowd of 15,000 at the Auckland Domain.\nIn 1920 Williams did not play rugby league but returned to the field in 1921, again wearing the Newton jersey. He was selected to play for New Zealand again on their tour of Australia and he played for them against the Auckland team at the Auckland Domain prior to leaving for Australia. New Zealand won 22–16 with Williams scoring a try just before halftime to take the lead out to 13–8.\nWilliams played in the first 4 tour matches and the final match. New Zealand was thrashed 56 points to 9 by New South Wales with Williams playing in the second row. He was to play all of his matches in this position. He had a happier time of it in the second match against Queensland 25–12 in front of 35,000 spectators. Despite the opponents being from the north the match was played at Sydney Cricket Ground. Williams crossed for a try in the second half. Williams travelled north to Brisbane where New Zealand were defeated by Queensland 16–21 on 11 June at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground. Queensland again defeated New Zealand 8–3 a week later with Williams once again playing in the second row. He wasn’t to play again until the final tour match against Newcastle which New Zealand won 27–14 the Newcastle Showgrounds in very wet conditions. This was to be the last time Williams would pull on the New Zealand jersey.\nAfter the tour Williams returned to Auckland where he was to play 3 matches in an Auckland jumper. He played in a 31–8 win over Wellington in what was the first ever match for Auckland on Carlaw Park. He then played in an 18–3 defeat of Hawke’s Bay, and a 58–25 thrashing of King Country.\nDuring the 1921 season Newton Struggled for players and defaulted a match. Soon after Williams transferred to the Fire Brigade side where he played 3 matches before the season ended. The following year he appears to have transferred back to rugby union but did not play a game before then asking the Auckland Rugby league if he could be regraded from 1st grade to 2nd grade and this was granted. Later in the season he transferred back to the Newton Rangers and scored tries in 3 consecutive matches. He was named in the reserves several times in the 1923 season but did not take the field.\nDeath.\nBill Williams died on 21 November 1927 aged just 28 when the 12 ft mullet yacht he was sailing capsized on its way from Milford on Auckland’s North Shore to Islington Bay on Rangitoto Island. Williams who was said to be a good sailor had persuaded Stanley John Easdown to go with him to Islington Bay to go fishing and shooting. They later saw James Bowman at Milford and he asked them if he could also go. The lone survivor (Easdown) went through harrowing conditions both in the water and once ashore on Rangitoto Island in an attempt to find help. A search failed to find either William's body or that of James Bowman.\nWilliams married Ivy Hazeldine Gildin Thomas (b.1896-1988) in 1922 they were living in Takapuna at the time with their young children."

        "title": "1988 Women's Cricket World Cup final",
        "text": "The 1988 Women's Cricket World Cup Final was a one-day cricket match between Australia and England played on 18 December 1988 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne, Australia. It marked the culmination of the 1988 Women's Cricket World Cup, the fourth edition of the tournament. Both Australia and England had previously won the competition; England won the inaugural tournament in 1973, while Australia won in both 1978 and 1982. Australia won the match by eight wickets to claim their third world title.\nAustralia and England finished first and second in the league-stage to claim their places in the final. England batted first in the final, but were hindered by a slow outfield, and found scoring difficult. The humid conditions helped Australia's spin bowlers, Lyn Fullston and Lyn Larsen, who combined for five wickets. Jan Brittin top-scored for England with 46 runs, as they made 127 for seven. In response, Australia initially struggled, losing two early wickets for 14 runs. An unbroken partnership of 115 runs between Lindsay Reeler and Denise Annetts saw Australia to victory with more than 15 overs remaining.\nBackground.\nThe 1988 Women's Cricket World Cup was the fourth Women's Cricket World Cup. The first had been held in 1973, pre-dating the first men's Cricket World Cup by two years. The 1988 tournament featured five teams; Australia, England, Ireland, the Netherlands and New Zealand. It took place between 29 November and 18 December, featuring 22 matches over 20 days. England had won the first World Cup on home soil, before Australia claimed both the next two. Neither of the first two tournaments had featured a final, but had rather been league competitions, in which the team which finished with the most points won. Australia had defeated England by three wickets in the final of the 1982 World Cup.\nRoute to the final.\nEach team played eight matches during the round-robin stage of the tournament, facing each other twice. The top two teams would progress directly to the final. Australia won all but one of their matches. Their 255-run win over the Netherlands on the opening day of the tournament remained the largest win by runs until 1997. Australia's only loss came against England, who beat them by 15 runs. Australia's opening batters, Lindsay Reeler and Ruth Buckstein, scored four of the five centuries made during the tournament; Reeler's 108 not out against New Zealand was the only one that was not scored against the Netherlands. England won six of their matches, and lost two; against Australia and New Zealand. Australia finished top of the group with 28 points, followed by England whose 24 points were four more than New Zealand in third. Ireland and the Netherlands were well behind, with 8 and 0 points respectively.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe final was held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, in Melbourne, Australia, on 18 December. The match was broadcast live on radio and on ABC Television in Australia, and in front of a crowd of 3,326. The Melbourne Cricket Ground was a large ground, capable of seating 90,000 people; England's Jan Brittin later said: \"The ground was wall-to-wall seating with no one sitting in them, which didn't lend itself to a big-match atmosphere.\" There had been a thunderstorm overnight, and the rain had left the outfield very wet. The England captain, Jane Powell, won the toss and decided to bat first. Her decision was primarily based on Australia's public aversion to batting second, and having to chase a target. Heather Smith of \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" suggested that, due to the wet conditions, \"England may have unwittingly helped their own downfall\".\nCarole Hodges and Wendy Watson opened the batting for England, and neither scored a run until the sixth over; the only runs attributed to England before that were wides bowled by the Australians, which \"The Age\" attributed to the \"excitement of playing on the MCG for the first time\". After 25 overs, England had scored 40 runs without losing a wicket, but both openers were frustrated by the slow run-rate. Watson was dismissed two overs later for 17; playing an aggressive shot, she was caught by Denise Annetts at cover off the bowling of Lyn Fullston. She had shared a 42-run opening partnership with Hodges, but John Woodcock of \"The Times\" complained that they \"lacked pace between the wickets, when something very spritely was needed\". England added ten more runs before Hodges was bowled by a delivery from Lyn Larsen which dislodged her off-bail. Hodges had scored 23, and England were 52 for two. Three of England's middle-order batters were dismissed for low scores: their captain, Powell, was caught behind off Larsen's bowling for one run; Karen Hicken was bowled by Fullston for five; Janet Aspinall was caught and bowled by Fullston for two. Brittin, who had come to the crease when Watson was out, remained not out; England were 74 for five.\nAfter lunch, Brittin and Jo Chamberlain scored more quickly for England, earning praise from both \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" and \"The Times\", but after putting on 26 runs together, Chamberlain was run out for 14 after the ball deflected off the bowler. Woodcock suggested that Brittin was England's only remaining hope. Patsy Lovell was trapped leg before wicket for four runs, while Suzie Kitson remained one not out at the end of the innings. Brittin had made England's highest score, 46 not out. Woodcock said that: \"It was a pity, really, that Brittin had not got in before the 27th over, with the touch she has.\" England scored 127 runs, a total \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" said \"was never going to be enough\". Throughout their 60-over innings, England scored two boundaries. In humid conditions, they especially struggled against spin bowling; Fullston took three wickets and allowed 29 runs, while Larsen took two wickets for 22. The wet outfield also slowed scoring; this dried as the match went on, giving Australia the better of the batting conditions. In the \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", Carol Salmon estimated that the slow outfield cost England between 20 and 30 runs.\nAspinall, who opened the bowling for England, struggled for accuracy; conceding extras, particularly wides, had been a problem for England all tournament and the final was no exception. In spite of this, England made an early breakthrough: Chamberlain, who according to \"The Age\" \"worried the Australians with her accurate medium-pacers\", trapped the Australian opener Buckstein leg before wicket without scoring in the second over. Australia's next batter, Sharlene Heywood only scored five runs in nine minutes until confusion between herself and Reeler led to Heywood being run out, leaving Australia on 14 for two. Annetts joined Reeler at the crease, and early in her innings was criticised by \"The Age\" for \"[dangling] a dangerously limp bat\". Reeler was troubled by the quicker bowling of Kitson, and in the 14th over, England were convinced that they had dismissed her, caught behind, but the umpire turned down the appeal. Reeler claimed the ball had clipped her pads, rather than her bat, before being caught by the wicket-keeper. After the appeal, Reeler played more circumspectly for a while, before taking the offensive with \"elegant driving and delicate cutting\", according to \"The Age\". In contrast to Reeler's technical style, Annetts played powerful shots, predominantly into the leg side. Reeler brought up her 50 and Australia's 100 from successive deliveries; the first a cover drive which went for a boundary, and the second an on drive. Annetts secured victory with a pull through the on side. Reeler finished with 59 runs, and Annetts with 48. The pair shared an unbroken 115-run partnership, and secured victory for Australia with eight wickets and more than 15 overs remaining.\nScorecard.\nUmpires:\nKey\nAftermath.\nReeler finished the tournament as the leading run-scorer, with 448 runs, while for the second successive World Cup, Fullston took the most wickets, with 16. After the tournament, Sharon Tredrea, Australia's vice-captain and former captain, announced her retirement. She was the only player who had appeared in all four World Cups. Between them, Australia and England have won ten of the eleven Women's Cricket World Cups; only in 2000 did one of the pair fail to win, when New Zealand beat Australia in the final."

        "text": "The Louisville Cardinals basketball statistical leaders are individual statistical leaders of the Louisville Cardinals men's basketball program in various categories, including points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Cardinals represent the University of Louisville in the NCAA's Atlantic Coast Conference.\nLouisville began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1911. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Louisville's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

The tour was founded in 1961 as the Far East Circuit. The first series of five tournaments was held in 1962 and consisted of the national open championships of the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong, plus a final tournament held in Japan. The tour gradually grew over the subsequent years, eventually becoming a regular ten tournament circuit in 1974.\nLeading players in the end of season standings were granted exemptions into major tournaments around the world, such as The Open Championship, the U.S. Open and the Memorial Tournament, and in later years were rewarded with playing status on the PGA of Japan Tour. Tournaments on the circuit also carried world ranking points between 1986, when the rankings were founded, and 1997.\nFor much of its early history the Asia Golf Circuit was dominated by players from Taiwan, Japan and Australia. The circuit became popular with young American professionals during the 1970s through into the 1990s, with future major champions Payne Stewart and Todd Hamilton having considerable success. In 1994 Asian players formed the Asian Professional Golfers Association and the following year started their own Asian PGA Tour, with twice the number of tournaments as the existing tour. Over the next few years, the national opens steadily defected to the new tour and although some replacement tournaments were added, the Asia Golf Circuit declined until it eventually ceased operating some time after 1999.\nHistory.\nIn 1959 Hong Kong Golf Club member Kim Hall wrote to Australian professional Eric Cremin to inquire as to whether some of the Australian professionals who were travelling to play in the Philippine Open, the only major open golf tournament in Southeast Asia at the time, would consider also playing in a tournament in Hong Kong during their trip. The result was the first Hong Kong Open which was contested by 24 golfers and won by Lu Liang-Huan. The success of the Hong Kong tournament prompted the foundation of the Singapore Open in 1961, with the assistance of multiple Open Championship winner Peter Thomson, and a circuit was beginning to form. An organising committee was established in October 1961, with the first Far East Circuit being held in 1962, when the three opens were joined by the Malayan Open and the Yomiuri International in Japan. The tournaments were played over five weeks in February and March with Seagram sponsoring a circuit prize for the four players with the lowest aggregate scores. Thomson was declared the first circuit champion, with fellow Australians Kel Nagle and Frank Phillips in second and third place, and New Zealander Bob Charles in fourth.\nFor the second season of the Far East Circuit, an additional tournament was scheduled in Osaka, Japan but it succumbed to adverse weather, with the course being covered in four inches of snow. In 1964 an additional tournament was scheduled for the Philippines, however this time Japan were unable to host their tournament during the circuit schedule so the tour again remained at five tournaments. Expansion finally happened later in the year when Thailand joined the circuit, with the Thailand Open being added to the schedule for 1965 with prize money for all tournaments far in excess of even the flagship tournaments in Australia. The circuit continued to grow, with the addition of the China Open in Taiwan in 1966. As the circuit continued to thrive, it was decided that a body was needed to oversee the running of the tour and introduce a single set of rules and conditions across all tournaments, and in 1967 a sub-committee was set up within the Asian Golf Confederation, which had been founded in 1963 and already taken on governance of the circuit.\nIn 1968, India and South Korea were expected to join the confederation with the intention of adding their pre-existing national open championships to the circuit, and the tour became known as the Asian Golf Circuit. After a short delay, the Indian Open, which had been first held in 1964, and Korea Open, which was founded in 1958, were added to the circuit schedule for the first time in 1970. In 1972 the Yomiuri International was cancelled when sponsors decided to discontinue the event for political reasons; it was swiftly replaced by the Sobu International Open. The Asia Golf Circuit reached ten tournaments in 1974, with the addition of the Indonesia Open. The circuit remained at an even ten for all but a few years of its life, despite attempts to expand further. In 1978, Papua New Guinea joined the confederation, prompting a rename of the organisation to the Asia-Pacific Golf Confederation, but attempts to add a tournament to the schedule were aborted. In 1982, South Korea withdrew their national open from the circuit due to a desire to reschedule it to later in the year when the weather would be more favourable, and the Maekyung Open was founded as a replacement. The Asia Golf Circuit did finally expand to eleven tournaments when Pakistan Open was added in 1989, with the intention for it to be held in alternate years, but it proved to be only a one-off. In addition, on several occasions the circuit was effectively reduced to nine events as the Philippine Open was not counted for the Order of Merit in 1979, and removed from the circuit from 1984 through 1986.\nBy the late 1980s, the Asia Golf Circuit had begun to feel the effects of the expanding PGA Tour of Australia, European Tour and PGA Tour, which had also introduced a development tour, schedules, as the number of big name players arriving for tournaments started to dwindle. Then in the early 1990s, the Australian Tour began to hold tournaments in Southeast Asia, with the Malaysian Masters, Perak Masters and Singapore PGA Championship being added to their Order of Merit schedule in 1991. In 1993, the Singapore Open joined the now renamed Australasian Tour and although organisers wished to also remain on the Asia Golf Circuit, this was rejected by the Asia-Pacific Golf Confederation. Later in the year, the Australasian Tour put forward a proposal to merge the two tours, however the Asia-Pacific Golf Confederation eventually dismissed them as unfavourable and saw themselves as being in the stronger position. In 1994, the circuit had been sponsored for the first time by Newsweek International, and known as the Newsweek Asian Tour, but the agreement was terminated after just one year with much blame being placed on circuit promoters, Spectrum, and the confederation severed ties with them after just two years of a five year deal.\nFurther problems for the Asia Golf Circuit soon arose as its players, who were unhappy with a lack of playing opportunities due to the limited number of tournaments and the number of overseas players on the tour, and prompted by promoter Seamus O'Brien of World Sport Group, founded the Asian PGA in 1994 with the intention of creating their own tour. The Asian PGA Tour launched in 1995 with twice the number of tournaments as the existing circuit. The Asia Golf Circuit responded by adding tournaments, including the Bali Open and Rolex Masters in early 1995, with further tournaments planned for later in the year along with the rescheduled Hong Kong Open, which was moved to November. Initially the two tours ran side by side, largely avoiding scheduling conflicts, but steadily the Asia Golf Circuit started losing tournaments to its neighbour. The Sabah Masters, which had only been on the circuit since 1994, joined the Asian PGA Tour in 1996; the Indonesian Open left in readiness for the 1997 season; Thailand, Korea and India followed suit a year later.\nAlthough the Asia-Pacific Golf Confederation added further tournaments to the schedule, such as the Southwoods Open and Manila Open, the circuit continued to lose ground to the Asian PGA. At the end of 1997, Official World Golf Ranking points were withdrawn from the Asia Golf Circuit, and the following year the Asian PGA Tour gained further recognition when it became an affiliate member of the International Federation of PGA Tours. The remaining national opens of Hong Kong, the Philippines and Malaysia soon joined the Asian PGA Tour and although the Asia Golf Circuit still ran a six tournament schedule in 1999, this proved to be the end of the tour."

The finals was then scheduled to take place between Friday 31 July and Saturday 22 August under a revised finals model similar to the NBL1 format.\nIn the wake of the coronavirus outbreak in Australia in early to mid March 2020, the season was suspended indefinitely with no games having taken place. On 14 May 2020, the season was officially cancelled due to the ongoing pandemic.\nWest Coast Classic.\nTo fill the void of a cancelled SBL season, a state amateur competition known as the West Coast Classic (WCC) was announced on 12 June 2020.

        "text": "The 1915–16 Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey season was the 19th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nBefore the season began, former members of the old Intercollegiate Hockey Association (Cornell and Dartmouth) agreed to join the then current Intercollegiate Hockey League. Instead of playing a best-of-three series against all members, the new squads would only play their conference opponents once during the season.\nHarvard began their title defense with a tune-up game against the Boston Athletic Association just before the winter break. After returning the Crimson faced Queen's and lost a close match to their Canadian opponents. The result of the game was secondary to the response from the crowd and an appeal to the Harvard faithful was made to show up in force to the remaining contests.\nIn their next game against Cornell the offense played rather poorly, with many scoring opportunities failing to the wayside. The team's defense, however, was in its typical stout form. Though the Big Red were hamstrung by a lack of practice, Harvard didn't give the Ithacans any chance and shut out Cornell for their first win of the season. The next game against a stronger Princeton squad and Harvard had to weather a barrage from the Tigers early in the game, but Wylde and the defense turned everything aside. In the second half Princeton got into penalty trouble, allowing the Crimson to score three times with the man-advantage and take the contest 3–0.\nThe rematch with Princeton one week later turned into a goaltending dual between Ford and Wylde. The two netminders kept their opponents scoreless through forty minutes of regulation and caused a pair of 5-minute overtimes to be used. Halfway through the first extra session Percy finally scored the first goal of the game to give Harvard the lead. Despite a furious pushback, Princeton was unable to solve Wylde and a further Crimson goal in the second overtime gave Harvard the series win over Princeton.\nHarvard's three-game shutout streak was finally ended by McGill at the end of the month, but the Crimson were still able to win the match and head into the second half of their season with an excellent chance at winning a championship. In the match against Dartmouth, Harvard continued the season-long shutout against fellow universities and entered the series against Yale just two wins away from the intercollegiate championship. In the initial game Harvard used six substitutions and 13 saves from Wylde to tally its fifth shutout of the season.\nBefore the rematch with the Elis, Harvard earned a somewhat surprising victory over the St. Nicholas Hockey Club who were led by Hobey Baker. The team speed, particularly from Percy, and the overall defensive effort allowed Harvard to keep their opponents at bay for most of the game and respond when their foes did manage to score. The second game from Yale saw the Crimson receive a better fight that they had all year, with the Bulldogs scoring twice to end Harvard's pursuit of a perfect defensive campaign against intercollegiate competition. Yale scored first in each of the two half but Harvard responded both times with a pair of goals and Harvard skated to a series sweep against the Elis, a perfect record into intercollegiate matches and their second consecutive intercollegiate championship.\nJohn Wylde's 5 shutouts on the season was a program record (tied) for 89 years while his 1.50 goals against average was one of the best results for a Crimson netminder.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The \"Glasgow Herald\" told of the time when Ross - with a SRU party of dignities - was with their sports journalist travelling to watch Scotland play France. The party was directed by the French police the wrong way up a one-way street to speed their progress to the Parc des Princes. The journalist recalled Ross's quip: 'If they had got their army to the Front this quickly, the course of history might have been changed'. The obituary noted that Ross was a journalist's delight: a man with an opinion on everything; and his best stories were told against himself.\nHe was cremated on 29 December 1997."

        "text": "The 1911–12 Princeton Tigers men's ice hockey season was the 13th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAfter a disappointing end to their previous season, second-year captain Alfred Kay looked to lead the team back to the top of the Intercollegiate Hockey Association. That job was made slightly easier due to Harvard removing itself from the conference due to a new policy by the operators at the St. Nicholas Rink. The Tigers began their season just after the start of the winter break with a game against Williams. Princeton won the extraordinarily lopsided game 14–0 and the headed to Cleveland for a three-game series with Yale. As they had the year before, Princeton won two of the three games but through their first four games it was apparent that the Tigers had a budding star on their hands.\nSophomore Hobey Baker distinguished himself from the first game against Williams, scoring 6 goals and immediately becoming the focal point of the Princeton offense. Baker's first real test with the team came in early January against Dartmouth. In their first conference game of the year Princeton utterly dominated the greens, posting the largest victory in the history of IHA play, 14–0. Throughout the game Baker was obvious as the best player on the ice and, while he scored four goals himself, he was responsible for a dozen of Princeton's scores, assisting directly on five of Kuhn's six tallies.\nThe next game came against Harvard who, despite having left the IHA, had agreed to play two games against Princeton that year. Despite their impressive wins to that point the Tigers had yet to face a team as talented as the Crimson and that was proven when Harvard skated away with a 3–2 win. Even in defeat Baker starred, scoring a goal and assisting on the other while simultaneously trying to hold back the vaunted Harvard attack. Still stinging after the defeat, Princeton laid into defending champion Cornell in their next game with Baker again the center of attention. The rover scored his second hat-trick of league play and assisted on at least two other goals in the Tigers' 6–1 win. A week later the Tigers played their second game against Harvard, this time at the Crimson's home venue. Princeton repaid Harvard for the earlier loss with their own 3–2 victory with Baker's second goal of the game serving as the eventual game-winner.\nPrinceton returned to its conference schedule just two days later against an improving Columbia team. The Lions kept the game close until midway through the second half when Baker scored a natural hat-trick to give the Tigers a commanding lead that they would ride to a 6–2 victory. In Princeton's final game of the season they took on Yale, the only team that could stop them from claiming the IHA championship. The two teams battled to a 0–0 draw after the first half but in the second half, as he had done all season, Hobey Baker came alive for the Tigers. He recorded yet another hat-trick and added an assist on Alfred Kay's goal to give the Tigers a 4–1 victory and their second championship in three years.\nDespite being a sophomore, Hobey Baker was the best player on his team and likely the best in college hockey, if not the entire country. He scored a hat-trick in each of the four IHA games, notching 26 goals and at least 15 assists in just 10 games. The team, recognizing his talent and leadership, elected him captain for the following season.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 1912–13 Princeton Tigers men's ice hockey season was the 14th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nWith both Yale and Columbia dropping from the Intercollegiate Hockey Association the league champion would be so in name only. As a result, Princeton made arrangements with Harvard and Yale to play best-of-three series against one another. Despite the upheaval, Princeton began the season well with a pair practice game wins before throttling Williams to open the season. Team captain Hobey Baker set a program record by recording 8 goals in the game and added three assists.\nPrinceton then embarked on a road trip to Syracuse for a three-game series with Cornell where the Tigers claimed all three contests. Despite being beset by two defenders for parts of the games, Baker scored 10 goals while assists were not recorded. For the first conference game Princeton jumped out to an early lead thanks to the efforts of Baker and Kuhn but Dartmouth clawed back into the game with a strong effort but ultimately fell short. The next game against Cornell was a lopsided affair with Baker scoring 5 goals and notching at least one assist in the 9–0 win that gave Princeton the IHA championship.\nThe difficult portion of their schedule began after claiming the conference title when the Tigers faced their toughest opponent to date, Yale. The Bulldogs followed a similar tactic to earlier opponents by pitting two defenders against Baker but with the increased talent possessed by the Elis their efforts were more effective. While Baker was held goal-less the rest of the team was able to build a two-goal lead in the second half but a flurry of three goals in three minutes by Yale left the Tigers reeling. Kilner managed to tie the game late and push the match into overtime. The tough defensive work done by Yale in regulation appeared to be all the Elis could give and just 12 seconds into the extra frame Patterson scored. The Tigers kept the pressure on, allowing Baker to score his only goal of the night just before the end of the 5-minute session and give Princeton the win.\nTheir next game came against Harvard and the two teams fought a close affair that required overtime. Crimson netminder Gardner stopped some 40 shots in the game and his team rewarded him with a victory, handing Princeton its first loss of the season. After two wins against non-college foes, Princeton faced Harvard in a rematch and would have to win the game to retain any hope of claiming a collegiate championship. The Tigers did just that, downing Harvard 3–1 with Baker repeating his earlier effort with a goal and an assist. The win set up a deciding game between the two but first Princeton would have to face Yale in a rematch.\nThe Tigers started slowly, being unable to beat Yale netminder Harmon, and allowed the Bulldogs to take a 1–0 lead into halftime. The game picked up speed in the second and the powerful offense for Princeton came to the fore. The Tigers scored 8 goals to Yale's 1 with Baker contributing on at least three goals including scoring the game-winner. Their final game of the year would serve as a de facto championship game against Harvard as the two teams had defeated all other peers throughout the season. Princeton played the Crimson hard and fired 29 shots on goal but all were turned aside and Harvard won the contest 3–0, sending a disappointed Tiger team packing.\nDespite the disappointing end, Hobey Baker's minimum of 35 goals on the season is a (unofficial) program record as of 2020. It's unknown how many assists he also scored, as the statistic was not officially recorded, but he was credited with at least 16 for the year. \nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "2020 Chinese Professional Baseball League season",
        "text": "The 2020 Chinese Professional Baseball League season was the 31st season of the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL). The season was scheduled to begin on 14 March, earlier than previous seasons in order to free up time for the CPBL players to participate in the final qualifying tournament of the 2020 Summer Olympics. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, opening day was delayed. On 1 April, the CPBL announced that the season would begin on 11 April with the rematch of last season's Taiwan Series teams: the champions Rakuten Monkeys hosting the CTBC Brothers, but behind closed doors with no fans attending. \nDue to inclement weather, game #1 and #2 hosted by Monkeys were postponed. This led to game #3, the CTBC Brothers hosting the Uni-President Lions on April 12 at Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium, becoming the first game of the season to play to completion. On May 8, a maximum of 1,000 fans were permitted to attend games. Restrictions were further relaxed on June 5: as long as there was one-seat spacing between spectators, attendance number was no longer restricted, and masks were no longer required while seated; food prepared on-site was again allowed.\nThe CPBL received international coverage because other major baseball leagues such as Major League Baseball in North America, Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan, and the KBO League in South Korea were still severely impacted by the virus outbreak and unable to confirm the dates of their respective season openings. The first-ever English broadcast of CPBL games also attracted international attention. \nThe annual CPBL All-Star Game was cancelled for the first time to accommodate to the compact schedule. The season concluded on 8 November with the Uni-President Lions winning the seasonal championship, by defeating the CTBC Brothers in Game 7 of the Taiwan Series with a score of 7:4.\nCompetition.\nFour teams, the Rakuten Monkeys, Uni-President Lions, Fubon Guardians, and CTBC Brothers will contest the CPBL, the highest level of professional baseball played in Taiwan. The season is divided into two halves, with each team playing 60 games in each half. The winners for each half-season plus the non-winner with the best overall record will qualify for the playoffs. In the event that the same team wins both halves, the next 2 teams with the best overall records will advance.\nIn May 2019, commissioner John Wu announced that the CPBL had reached an agreement with Ting Hsin International Group, largest and managing shareholder of Wei Chuan Foods Corporation, to reactivate Wei Chuan Dragons. The Dragons would participate in the minor league during 2020 season and expected to return to the major league in 2021.\nDuring first-half season, it was discovered that the coefficient of restitution (COR) of the official game baseball had an average of 0.573 between two tests, above the 0.550~0.570 target only below the 0.540~0.580 rejection limit, resulting in faster ball-batted speed and high homerun production. After the May General Managers meeting, the League decided to tighten quality control of the official game baseball, with COR of 0.560 as the target. On the test conducted in July, the COR was 0.563, meeting the new requirements. This had resulted in less offense-centric and more balanced games in the second-half season.\nBroadcast rights.\nFollowing a dispute between the CPBL and MP &amp; Silva during the , broadcast rights to CPBL games were acquired over the intervening seasons by Eleven Sports, , , and Videoland Television Network. English-language broadcasts were added on a trial basis and streamed via the Twitter account of Eleven Sports Taiwan. A number of international fans tuned in, and all CPBL teams subsequently announced that they would feature English commentary.\nStandings.\nFirst half standings.\nThe CTBC Brothers claimed the first half Championship on July 14, by defeating Uni-President Lions with a score of 6:1 in the resumption of game #62, which was suspended on May 26 at top of third inning with a score of 1:0 due to rain.\nSecond half standings.\nThe Uni-President Lions clinched the second-half Championship on October 24 at the last regular season game, by defeating CTBC Brothers with the score of 3:2 in the resumption of game #193. Game #193, hosted by Lions at their homefield Tainan Municipal Baseball Stadium, was suspended on September 12 at the top of Third inning after one out due to rain, with the score tied at 1:1. This was Lions' first half-season Championship since the 2013 second-half Championship.\nPlayoffs.\nBecause the first-half and second-half championships were won by different teams, the 2020 Taiwan Series, a best of seven series, was played. The first-half champions, the CTBC Brothers, faced the second-half champions, the Uni-President Lions, with the first game scheduled on October 31 and the seventh game on November 8. The Brothers, by having a better yearly record, earned home field advantage, hosting games 1, 2, 6, and 7 at their home field, Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium. The Lions hosted games 3, 4, and 5 at their home field, Tainan Municipal Baseball Stadium. The two teams last faced off at a playoff series in the 2009 Taiwan Series.\nRules.\nAll regular season rules apply with the following exceptions:\nGame summaries.\nGame 5.\nDown 1-3 in the series, Uni-Lions' starting pitcher Brock Dykxhoorn pitched a complete-game shut-out using 126 pitches. Coupling with timely hits from the bottom-half of the batting order, the Uni-Lions defeated the Brothers with a score of 6:0 in the final home game of the season and forced the series back to Taichung."

The Oberliga operated with two regional leagues, North and South. 24 teams competed in the season that spanned from 28 September 2019 till 11 March 2020. The regular season and championship playoff qualifiers was completed, but the season was then cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the remainder of the Oberliga season was cancelled by DEB.

EV Landshut left the league after being promoted to DEL2. EV Füssen joined the league from the Bayernliga while EHC Waldkraiburg went the other direction.

        "text": "The Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball statistical leaders are individual statistical leaders of the Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball program in various categories, including points, three-pointers, assists, blocks, rebounds, and steals. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Cavaliers represent the University of Virginia in the NCAA's Atlantic Coast Conference.\nVirginia began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1905. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Virginia's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2021–22 season."

        "text": "The North Dakota State Bison men's basketball statistical leaders are individual statistical leaders of the North Dakota State Bison men's basketball program in various categories, including points, three-pointers, assists, blocks, rebounds, and steals. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Bison represent North Dakota State University in the NCAA's Summit League.\nNorth Dakota State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1897. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nAn added complication in statistical recording is that North Dakota State did not begin playing in Division I until the 2004–05 season, having previously been in Division II. This is significant because the NCAA did not officially record assists, blocks, and steals in D-II until several years after it began doing so in D-I. The NCAA briefly recorded assists as a statistic in 1950–51 and 1951–52, before the NCAA first split into divisions in 1956. However, after 1952, assists were not officially recorded again in D-I until the 1983–84 season. Blocks and steals were first officially recorded in D-I in the 1985–86 season. By contrast, assists were not officially recorded in D-II until 1988–89, and blocks and steals were not officially recorded in that division until 1992–93. Nonetheless, North Dakota State's record books includes players in these statistics before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

Through 2020, the team has an all–time record of 50–50.\nIn the team's inaugural season, Boston U scored its first-ever program victory with a 13 to 5 defeat of the Lafayette Leopards. In the program's short history, the Terriers defeated their first ranked foes in route to a 12–5 record in 2017, their best to date. During that campaign, the team upset #17 Navy 8–7 in Annapolis, Maryland, before topping the #19 Loyola Greyhounds 12–11 in an overtime showdown. The victory over the Greyhounds clinched the program's first berth in a Patriot League postseason game and first national ranking. However, a difficult defeat at the hands of Army in the semifinals of the Patriot League tournament denied the Terriers a shot at their first NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship appearance. In 2019, the Terriers again upset Loyola, ranked #2, in a resounding 7 point victory for the highest ranked victory in team history. The victory propelled Boston U to their third consecutive appearance in the Patriot League tournament. Additionally, sophomore attacker Chris Gray gained a 2019 Tewaaraton Award nomination and gained second-team All-American honors after the campaign, prior to his transfer to North Carolina.\nSeason Results.\nThe following is a list of Boston U's results by season:\n†NCAA canceled 2020 collegiate activities due to the COVID-19 virus."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Crusaders represent the College of the Holy Cross in the NCAA's Patriot League.\nHoly Cross began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1900. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Holy Cross's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "Jermaine Johnson Sr. (born July 4, 1985) is an American politician, political advisor and former professional basketball player. A member of the Democratic Party, he is the representative for South Carolina's 70th district. Johnson previously represented the 80th district in the South Carolina House of Representatives prior to redistricting.\nEarly life.\nJohnson was born on July 4, 1985, in Los Angeles, California. He grew up during the crack epidemic and his family struggled with homelessness, living in and out of motels following home evictions. His father spent time in prison and his brother was in the military. Johnson's face was scarred when he was pistol-whipped as a teenager.\nAthletic career.\nHigh school and college career.\nJohnson's AAU coach helped him get into prep schools for basketball. Johnson attended seven high schools while growing up including Trinity-Pawling School and Redemption Christian Academy. He eventually attended and graduated from the Winchendon School. \nIn high school, Johnson received interest from the College of Charleston and Long Beach State for basketball. He committed to the College of Charleston. Three months into his redshirt freshman season, Johnson got into an altercation with his teammate Jeff Horowitz. Johnson intended to transfer to Long Beach State, but ended up staying at Charleston College.\nIn 2008, Johnson scored the first points in the TD Arena for the Cougars.\nJohnson served as Charleston's captain during his senior year. He finished his career as one of only four players in school history with at least 1,100 points and 850 rebounds.\nProfessional career.\nD-League.\nJohnson was drafted by the Reno Bighorns in the 6th round of the NBA Development Draft. He was released from the team after one year. He trained with James Harden and Amar'e Stoudemire during summer workouts in Los Angeles.\nInternational career.\nJohnson played more than six years, professionally overseas including in France, Mexico, Hungary and Canada. He starred during his time in the Mexican Basketball League where he averaged 21 points and 8 rebounds per game.\nPolitical career.\nJohnson is the founder and CEO of the New Economic Beginnings Foundation, which helps educate and find employment for opportunities for troubled youth and veterans.\nCurrently, Johnson serves as the 3rd Vice Chair of the Richland County Democratic party, Richland County Recreation Commissioner, Vice Chair of the Young Democrats of the Central Midlands and Minority Caucus Chair of the Young Democrats of South Carolina.\nJohnson served as the South Carolina Campaign Chair for Andrew Yang's 2020 presidential campaign.\nSouth Carolina House of Representatives.\nIn 2020, Johnson announced he would challenge Democratic incumbent Jimmy Bales for his seat in the South Carolina House of Representatives. Johnson centered his campaign around universal basic income, community investment, economic investment, district enhancement and access and accountability. He earned endorsements from former 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang, former South Carolina State Representative and current CNN political analyst Bakari Sellers and current South Carolina State Representative JA Moore. In June 2020, Johnson defeated Bales in the Democratic Primary and became the Democratic nominee.\nAfter redistricting following the 2020 United States census, Johnson's district was merged into House District 70. This forced Johnson to run in a contested primary against fellow-representative Wendy Brawley. In the primary, Johnson garnered 50.11% person of the vote to defeat Brawley by 115 votes.\nJohnson currently serves on the House Education and Public Works Committee. He is Secretary of the House Minority Caucus.\nPersonal life.\nJohnson has three children. He received a Doctorate of Business Administration and Organizational Leadership from Northcentral University in 2018."

Prior to that teams played either in the University Division, which became Division I, or the College Division, which was split into Divisions II and III. College Division independents are listed here for reference as a majority of the College Division programs joined the Division II level regardless of where their respective schools were reclassified.\nDuring the 1960s and 70s most western schools competed in the NAIA and did not fall under the jurisdiction of the NCAA. This began to change once the NCAA instituted the Division II Tournament in 1978. In some cases NCAA teams were invited to participate in the NAIA tournament, leaving the ordering of schools at that time unclear."

Because only six schools play at the D-II level, no NCAA Tournament is currently being held (as of 2023). A seventh school, Stonehill, left the D-II ranks in July 2022 when it moved its athletic program to the Division I Northeast Conference.\nThe teams comprising the Division II level played in Division III conferences until 2009 but have been playing their conference tournaments since 2000."

        "text": "The 2021 PDC World Darts Championship (known for sponsorship reasons as the 2021 William Hill World Darts Championship) was the 28th World Championship organised by the Professional Darts Corporation since it separated from the British Darts Organisation. The collapse of the BDO in September 2020 and subsequent postponement of the World Darts Federation-sanctioned event meant that this edition was the first undisputed World Championship in the sport since John Lowe won the BDO World Darts Championship in 1993. The event took place at the Alexandra Palace in London from 15 December 2020 – 3 January 2021, and was played behind closed doors, except for the first day of the tournament, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPeter Wright was the defending champion, after defeating Michael van Gerwen 7–3 in the 2020 final. However, he was surprisingly eliminated by Gabriel Clemens in the third round.\nGerwyn Price won the World Championship for the first time in his career, beating Gary Anderson 7–3 in the final. As a result of winning the title, Gerwyn took over from Michael van Gerwen as world number 1.\nSteve Beaton played in a record 30th consecutive World Championship (including the BDO version), breaking the record he jointly held with Phil Taylor, but lost in the first round to Diogo Portela.\nJames Wade hit his first World Championship nine-dart finish and the first PDC World Championship nine-darter since 2016 in his third round defeat to Stephen Bunting.\nFormat.\nAll matches were played as single in, double out; requiring the players to score 501 points to win a leg, finishing on either a double or the bullseye. Matches were played to set format, with each set being the best of five legs (first to three). A rule which has been in place for previous tournaments, where the final set had to be won by two clear legs, was removed in order to prevent sessions overrunning.\nThe matches got longer as the tournament progresses:\nPrize money.\nThe prize money for the tournament was £2,500,000 in total – the same as in the previous year. The winner's share was £500,000.\nQualification.\nQualifiers.\nThe top 32 from the PDC Order of Merit began the competition in the second round. The 32 highest ranked players on the PDC Pro Tour Order of Merit (not already qualified) and 32 qualifiers from around the world began in the first round.\nOrder of Merit \"Second round (seeded)\"\n \"(quarter-finals)\"\n \"(third round)\"\n (champion)\n \"(second round)\"\n \"(second round)\"\n \"(third round)\"\n \"(third round)\"\n \"(semi-finals)\"\n \"(fourth round)\"\n \"(second round)\"\n \"(quarter-finals)\"\n \"(fourth round)\"\n \"(runner-up)\"\n \"(third round)\"\n \"(quarter-finals)\"\n \"(fourth round)\"\n \"(third round)\"\n \"(third round)\"\n \"(fourth round)\"\n \"(third round)\"\n \"(second round)\"\n \"(third round)\"\n \"(second round)\"\n \"(third round)\"\n \"(third round)\"\n \"(semi-finals)\"\n \"(fourth round)\"\n \"(second round)\"\n \"(fourth round)\"\n \"(third round)\"\n \"(fourth round)\"\n \"(third round)\"\nPro Tour Order of Merit\"First Round\"\nInternational Qualifiers\"First Round\"\nBackground.\nMichael van Gerwen, the runner-up in the 2020 PDC World Darts Championship and winner of the 2014, 2017 and 2019 championships, was top of the two-year PDC Order of Merit and number one seed going into the tournament, having won the UK Open and Players Championship Finals titles in 2020. The reigning champion from 2020 Peter Wright was second seed, having additionally won the 2020 European Championship; and 2020 World Grand Prix champion Gerwyn Price was the third seed. As well as Van Gerwen and Wright, three other previous PDC world champions qualified as seeds: two-time champions Gary Anderson (13th seed) and Adrian Lewis (21st seed), and 2018 champion Rob Cross (fifth seed). Two champions of the BDO World Darts Championship qualified as seeds: three-time BDO champion and 2020 Premier League Darts winner Glen Durrant (12th seed) and 2014 BDO champion Stephen Bunting (26th seed).\nThe top seeds below Van Gerwen, Wright and Price were 2019 World finalist Michael Smith, Rob Cross, 2019 UK Open champion Nathan Aspinall, 2020 Grand Slam and European Championship finalist James Wade, 2019 World Grand Prix finalist Dave Chisnall, and 2020 World Matchplay winner Dimitri Van den Bergh. 2020 Grand Slam of Darts winner José de Sousa was seeded 14th.\nDamon Heta, in his first full year as a full PDC tour card holder, was the highest-ranked non-seed on the 2020 PDC Pro Tour Order of Merit. Two-time BDO World Champion Scott Waites qualified for the PDC World Championship for the first time, and was one of two former BDO Champions to qualify through the Pro Tour, alongside Steve Beaton, the 1996 BDO champion, competing in a record-breaking 30th consecutive World Championship.\nAs well as Waites, six other players from the Pro Tour made their PDC Championship debuts; Mike De Decker, Martijn Kleermaker, Maik Kuivenhoven, Jason Lowe, Ryan Murray and Derk Telnekes. Other players to qualify via the Pro Tour included 2020 World Grand Prix finalist Dirk van Duijvenbode and 2012 PDC World Championship runner-up Andy Hamilton.\nThe international qualifiers were heavily impacted by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, with a number of qualification tournaments being cancelled. The North American Darts Championship was cancelled, with the place being given to Danny Lauby, the winner of the 2019 CDC Continental Cup. The cancellation of the Oceanic Masters resulted in a second place being given on the Dartplayers Australia tour; and the cancellation of the New Zealand championship saw the place instead being given to the top player on the Dartplayers New Zealand tour, Haupai Puha. The qualifiers for India and South America were both cancelled, with the Indian place going to the Indian Darts Federation number one Amit Gilitwala, and the South American place being given to Diogo Portela, who had won the South American qualifier the three previous years it had been held.\nThe PDC Asia Tour was fully cancelled, with the four places being awarded to the winners of one-off qualification events in China, Hong Kong, Japan, and the Philippines. The Tom Kirby Irish Matchplay as well as qualifiers for Southern Europe, Western Europe, and Central Europe were not held in 2020; with these places being given to the final Pro Tour holders qualifier. One further change saw the two qualification events for female players being replaced with the new, four-event long, PDC Women's Series, with the top two players over those events – four-times BDO Women's World Champion Lisa Ashton and Deta Hedman – qualifying for the World Championship.\nThe final six places – four from uncompleted qualifiers and two as planned – were given to the winners of an event for Tour Card holders held at the conclusion of the PDC Series. Four places were reserved for players from the UK and Ireland and two from the rest of the world; a change from previous years where the places were unassigned. The six players to get through the qualifier included Jamie Lewis, a former World Championship semi-finalist.\nThirteen players from international qualifiers made their PDC World Championship debuts; Bradley Brooks, Cameron Carolissen, David Evans, Edward Foulkes, Amit Gilitwala, Dmitriy Gorbunov, Deta Hedman, Nick Kenny, Danny Lauby, Haupai Puha, Toru Suzuki, Di Zhuang and Niels Zonneveld.\nMartijn Kleermaker withdrew from the tournament after testing positive for COVID-19 on 20 December. As the first alternate Josh Payne had been in close contact with someone who had also received a positive test, Kleermaker's first round opponent Cameron Carolissen received a bye.\nSummary.\nUK government regulations following the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom allowed Tier 2 areas, including London, to hold sporting events with up to 1,000 spectators indoors. The Professional Darts Corporation announced that the World Championship would be the first PDC event in the United Kingdom to allow fans, since the UK Open in March 2020. Fans attending the event were not allowed to wear fancy dress and 'football style' chanting was prohibited. With London subsequently moving to Tier 3 on 16 December, it meant that the tournament was held behind closed doors for all sessions barring the opening night.\nThe top quarter of the draw saw number one seed Michael van Gerwen defeat Ryan Murray in the second round, before a 4–0 win over Ricky Evans qualified him for the fourth round. In that round, Van Gerwen came from 3–1 down and survived two darts at the bullseye from Joe Cullen to win in a sudden death last leg and reach the quarter-final for the fifth consecutive year and the eighth time overall. Number eight seed Dave Chisnall reached his third PDC World Championship quarter-final after wins over Keegan Brown, Danny Noppert and Dimitri Van den Bergh. In the quarter-final, Chisnall stunned Michael van Gerwen with a 5–0 whitewash win over the world number one to reach the first PDC World Championship semi-final of his career. This defeat was van Gerwen's first whitewash loss (without winning a set) since 2009, when he lost to Phil Taylor.\nThe two highest seeds in the second quarter were both eliminated early, with fourth seed Michael Smith losing 3–1 to debutant Jason Lowe and fifth seed Rob Cross losing in a sudden death last leg to Dirk van Duijvenbode. Former world champion Adrian Lewis also exited in the second round, losing to American Danny Baggish 3–1. Two time champion Gary Anderson beat Madars Razma in the second round before beating Mensur Suljović 4–3 in a controversial game, with Anderson accusing his opponent of gamesmanship. Anderson then whitewashed Lowe's conqueror Devon Petersen to reach the eighth PDC World Championship quarterfinal of his career. Van Duijvenbode followed up his win over Cross with a 4–0 win over Adam Hunt and a second last-leg victory, this time over Glen Durrant, to reach his first PDC World Championship quarter-final. Van Duijvenbode won the first set against Anderson in the quarter-final, but Anderson turned the game around including a run of ten legs in a row to win the match 5–1.\nPeter Wright opened his title defence with a 3–1 win over Steve West, appearing on stage dressed as The Grinch. Wright's reign was ended in the next round, after Gabriel Clemens won a last leg decider over him. Krzysztof Ratajski made it past Ryan Joyce and Simon Whitlock without dropping a set, before knocking out Clemens with a last leg victory of his own, with both players missing multiple darts to win before Ratajski finally hit double one to take the win and become the first Polish player to make a PDC World Championship quarter-final. Seventh seed James Wade was eliminated in the third round by Stephen Bunting, despite hitting the first perfect Nine-dart finish at the World Championship since Gary Anderson at the 2016 PDC World Darts Championship. Bunting overcame Ryan Searle in the fourth round to qualify for the quarter-finals for the second time. In the quarter-final; Bunting took the first three sets and led 4–1 after the fifth. Ratajski closed the gap to 4–3 over the next two sets but Bunting broke throw in the eighth set to complete the win and qualify for his first PDC World Championship semi-final.\nIn the fourth quarter, third seed Gerwyn Price came thorough a last set decider against fellow Welshman Jamie Lewis and a sudden death last leg decider against 30th seed Brendan Dolan to reach the fourth round, where he took a 4–1 win over Mervyn King to reach the quarter-final for the second consecutive year. He was joined in the quarter-final by Daryl Gurney, who reached that stage for the second time after wins over William O'Connor, Chris Dobey, and Vincent van der Voort. In the quarter-final, Price twice led by two sets at 2–0 &amp; 4–2; and on both occasions Gurney won the next two sets to level. The final set went to a final leg, with Price eventually hitting the double 20 to win and reach a second consecutive semi-final.\nThe first semi-final played was between Price and Bunting. Price won the first set and took a 2–0 lead in the second before Bunting fought back to take the second set and the next two. Price took the fifth and sixth sets to level before Bunting again fought back from 2–0 down in a set to lead after the seventh set. Price levelled the match by winning the eighth set and won the last two sets by 3–0 and 3–1 to become the first Welsh player to reach a PDC World Championship final. The thirteen 100+ finishes thrown by the two players was a record combined count for a PDC World Championship match.\nIn the second semi-final, Anderson and Chisnall shared the first two sets, before Anderson claimed the next two to take a 3–1 lead. Chisnall broke Anderson's throw to take the fifth set, but Anderson immediately broke back and won the sixth. Again, Chisnall won the seventh set but Anderson restored the two set advantage with an eighth set victory. Anderson won all three legs in the ninth set to secure a 6–3 win, qualifying the two-time World Champion for his fifth PDC World Championship final.\nThe final between Anderson and Price was held on 3 January 2021. Anderson threw first in the first set and won the first two legs, but missed four darts for a 3–0 set win, and Price came back to take the set 3–2. Anderson broke back with a 3–1 win in the second set. Price broke again in the third set despite a \"big fish\" 170 finish from Anderson, and held his throw in the fourth set to take a 3–1 advantage. Price again broke Anderson's throw in the fifth set, and won the sixth 3–0. Price took a two leg lead in the seventh set, but Anderson fought back to take only his second set of the match. Price regained the four-set advantage by winning the eighth set to go one away from winning the title. Price missed nine darts for the championship in the ninth set, which Anderson won. In the tenth set, Price fought back from 2–0 to eventually take the set and the championship, winning the title on double five.\nPrice's first World Championship additionally saw him take the number one spot on the PDC Order of Merit away from Michael van Gerwen, the Dutchman having held the title for seven years since winning the 2014 PDC World Darts Championship.\nDraw.\nThe draw took place on 3 December 2020, live on Sky Sports News.\nTop averages.\nThis table shows the highest averages achieved by players throughout the tournament.\nRepresentation.\nThis table shows the number of players by country in the 2021 PDC World Championship.

With that goal in mind the Quakers sought to have a good season to prove that they belonged in the conference. Unfortunately the first squad they faced was defending champion Princeton and the Quakers were outmatched in a 0–7 defeat. Over the winter break the team was to play a two-game series in Cleveland, however, no mention of the trip can be found in the University newspaper.\nA further game was scheduled in February against Army but that game was never played. While efforts were made to secure opponents for the team, nothing came to fruition and the season ended with a whimper.\nWhile the effort to restart the ice hockey program had begun well, the lack of a local rink to use became too big of a stumbling block for the team and efforts to keep it afloat ceased. Ironically, the IHA, the league that Penn wanted to rejoin, would not survive much longer either.

        "text": "The 2019 Diamond League Shanghai was the 15th edition of the annual outdoor track and field meeting in Shanghai, China. Held on 18 May at the Shanghai Stadium, it was the second leg of the 2019 IAAF Diamond League – the highest level international track and field circuit. 24 events were contested with 15 of them being point-earning Diamond League disciplines. The other events were held for Chinese nationals, except for the men's 200 m which attracted an international field of Olympic and world medalists.\nHighlights included an Asian and Chinese record in the women's pole vault by Li Ling with a mark of 4.72 m on her second attempt (though she placed second to world champion Katerina Stefanidi who vaulted the same height but on her first attempt), and a meeting record by Lyu Huihui in the javelin throw of 66.89 m to defend her 2018 meeting title. Also in the women's events were the world leading times of 4:01.15 in the 1500 m by Rababe Arafi, and 9:04.53 in the 3000 m steeplechase by world record holder Beatrice Chepkoech, the latter also a meeting record. 19-year old Sydney McLaughlin, the fastest junior in history in the 400 m hurdles, stepped into the hurdles-free 400 m and was able to stay with the reigning Diamond League champion Salwa Eid Naser for most of the race, but Naser pulled away in the home straight with a seasonal best of 50.65 seconds.\nOn the men's side one of the most anticipated events was the 400 m hurdles in which Abderrahman Samba and Rai Benjamin, the second and third fastest in history respectively in the event, met for the first time in competition. Samba however ran away with a clear victory in a meeting record and world leading 47.27 seconds, ahead of second place Benjamin who finished in a seasonal best of 47.80 seconds. The 100 m was a much closer race, with reigning Diamond League champions Christian Coleman and Noah Lyles in the 100 m and 200 m respectively both finishing in a world leading 9.86 seconds. In an upset the victory was given to Lyles after an analysis of the race footage showed Lyles finishing in 9.852 to Coleman's 9.858. Olympic and world champion Omar McLeod came back to win for the fourth year in a row in the 110 m hurdles, dedicating his achievement to his aunt who died the day before the race. Additional world leads were set in the 5000 m by Yomif Kejelcha (13:04.16) and in the javelin throw by Andreas Hofmann (87.55 m).\nDiamond League results.\nAthletes competing in the Diamond League disciplines earned extra compensation and points which went towards qualifying for one of two Diamond League finals (either Zürich or Brussels depending on the discipline). First place earned 8 points, with each step down in place earning one less point than the previous, until no points are awarded in 9th place or lower."

        "text": "There have been 21 editions of the FIFA World Cup which is an international association football tournament established in 1930. It is contested by the men's national teams which are members of FIFA, the sport's global governing body. The tournament has taken place every four years since its inauguration, apart from 1942 and 1946 due to World War II. The last tournament was hosted in Qatar, which was won by Argentina in 2022.\nThe World Cup final match is the last of the competition, and the result determines which country is declared world champions. If after 90 minutes of regular play the score is a draw, an additional 30-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If such a game is still tied after extra time, it is then decided by a penalty shoot-out. The team winning the penalty shoot-out are then declared champions. The tournament has been decided by a one-off match on every occasion except 1950, when the tournament winner was decided by a final round-robin group contested by four teams (Uruguay, Brazil, Sweden, and Spain). Uruguay's 2–1 victory over Brazil was the decisive match (and one of the last two matches of the tournament) that put them ahead on points and ensured that they finished top of the group as world champions. Therefore, this match is regarded by FIFA as the \"de facto\" final of the 1950 World Cup.\nEach final is hosted at usually the host nation's largest stadium, as the final attracts the largest crowds and the most attention. Two stadiums have hosted multiple finals, these being the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, Mexico and the Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Alongside those two cities, Rome, Italy has also hosted multiple finals. These were held at the Stadio Nazionale PNF and the Stadio Olimpico. Île-de-France has also hosted two finals, them being at the Stade Olympique de Colombes in Colombes and the Stade de France in Saint-Denis."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Wolverines represent the University of Michigan in the NCAA's Big Ten Conference.\nMichigan began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1909. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Michigan's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2022–23 season."

        "text": "Garrett Fitzgerald (14 June 1954 – 14 February 2020) was an Irish rugby union player and coach, who was CEO of Munster Rugby between 1999 and 2019.\nLife.\nBorn in Knockraha, County Cork, Fitzgerald attended Christian Brothers College, Cork and won a Munster Schools Rugby Senior Cup during the 1970s. During an 18-year playing career in rugby union, Fitzgerald played in the front-row for University College Cork R.F.C. and Cork Constitution. In a 19-year coaching career, Fitzgerald coached Christian Brothers College to five Munster Schools Senior Cups, as well as working with Irish Universities, Munster under-20s and UCC. Perhaps his most famous achievement as a coach came in 1992, when he coached Munster to a 22–19 victory against then-world champions Australia in Musgrave Park.\nFitzgerald became Munster's CEO in 1999 and was a driving force behind the province becoming a European powerhouse. He was at the helm for some of the greatest days in the province's history, including their coveted first Heineken Cup success in 2006, followed by a second triumph in 2008, as well as three league triumphs in 2002–03, 2008–09 and 2010–11. He also oversaw the redevelopment of both Thomond Park and Musgrave Park, and the consolidation of Munster's training bases in Cork and Limerick into one base at the University of Limerick.\nIn June 2019, upon reaching retirement age, Fitzgerald duly retired from his role at Munster. He was, at the time, the longest serving provincial chief executive in Irish rugby. Post-retirement, Fitzgerald was honoured with the \"Richard Harris Patron's Award\" at Munster's annual London dinner in September 2019. The award recognises an individual who encapsulates Munster's values, and Fitzgerald was similarly recognised by the \"Federation of Irish Sport\" for his contributions. In December 2019, the University of Limerick awarded Fitzgerald an honorary doctorate.\nFollowing a battle with illness, Fitzgerald died on 14 February 2020 at Marymount University Hospital and Hospice, Cork. He is survived by his wife, Áine, and their children Megan, Jamie and Michael. Many ex-colleagues of Fitzgerald's, including former Munster coaches and players, were quick to pay tribute to him. Fitzgerald was posthumously inducted into the Munster Rugby Hall of Fame in November 2020, and, in 2021, the trophy awarded to the winners of the Munster Schools Rugby Senior Cup was renamed the \"Garrett Fitzgerald Cup\" in tribute to him."

He played college football at West Virginia, and previously played for the St. Louis BattleHawks of the XFL and the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League (NFL).\nEarly years.\nRobinson grew up in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, and began his high school career as a freshman at Central Catholic before transferring to University Prep. His junior season was derailed by a leg injury. After the season, Robinson transferred to Imani Christian Academy for his senior year. He was named PIAA all-state 1A first-team as a defensive back. A 3-star recruit, Robinson committed to West Virginia over offers from Virginia Tech, Iowa State, Toledo, Temple, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh.\nCollege career.\nRobinson mainly played safety for the West Virginia Mountaineers after playing cornerback for several games as a freshman. He returned an interception 94 yards for a touchdown against Texas as a freshman and made the game-saving pick versus Kansas State. Robinson had 123 tackles and 7 interceptions, two of which were returned for a defensive touchdown, in his two-year college career. He was named to the First-team All-Big 12 Conference after his sophomore season. Robinson was expelled from West Virginia after a student code of conduct violation involving academic fraud. He initially entered the transfer portal in June 2019, but ultimately decided to join the XFL to provide for his family's immediate needs.

He said he chose the XFL to help his mother, who had been diagnosed with cancer. In Week 3 of the season, Robinson had an interception, and in Week 5, he was nominated for the XFL's Star of the Week with a pick and a sack. In the coronavirus-shortened XFL season, Robinson started all five games for the BattleHawks and had 21 tackles and two interceptions. He had his contract terminated when the league suspended operations on April 10, 2020.\nCarolina Panthers.\nThe Carolina Panthers selected Robinson with the 152nd pick in the fifth round of the 2020 NFL Draft, making him the first XFL player to be drafted into the NFL. Robinson was represented at the draft by Beyond Athlete Management. He was waived on September 6, 2020, and re-signed to the practice squad the next day. Robinson was promoted to the active roster on October 20.\nOn August 31, 2021, Robinson was waived by the Panthers, and re-signed to the practice squad the next day.

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Pirates represent Seton Hall University in the NCAA's Big East Conference.\nSeton Hall began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1903. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Seton Hall record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "The first night game in Major League Baseball history occurred on May 24, 1935, when the Cincinnati Reds beat the Philadelphia Phillies 2–1 at Crosley Field. The original plan was that the Reds would play seven night games each season, one against each visiting club. Night baseball quickly found acceptance in other Major League cities and eventually became the norm; the term \"day game\" was subsequently coined to designate the increasingly rarer afternoon contests.\n\"Monday Night Baseball\" was born on October 19, 1966, when NBC signed a three-year contract to televise the game. Under the deal, NBC paid roughly $6 million per year for the 25 \"Games of the Week\", $6.1 million for the 1967 World Series and 1967 All-Star Game, and $6.5 million for the 1968 World Series and 1968 All-Star Game. This brought the total value of the contract (which included three Monday night telecasts each season) up to $30.6 million.\nThe last non-expansion/non-relocated team to play all their home games in the daytime were the Chicago Cubs; they played their first official night game in Wrigley Field on August 9, 1988, and beat the New York Mets 6–4, one night after their initial attempt at night baseball (against the Philadelphia Phillies) was rained out before it became official. The Cubs still play the fewest home night games of any major league club (35 per season, as of 2014).\nThe first night All-Star Game was held at Philadelphia's Shibe Park in 1943, while the first World Series night game was Game 4 of the 1971 Series at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh. All All-Star Games since 1969, and all World Series games since Game 6 of the 1987 Series, have been played at night."

        "text": "The 1913–14 Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey season was the 17th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAfter paring the team down to 24 men, Harvard began its first year as a major sport with a tune-up game against the Boston Athletic Association. Soft ice and early-season jitters contributed to a less-than-stellar effort from the Crimson and they lost the match 1–3 while cycling through many of their alternate players. The loss was unfortunate but hardly damaging to their season. A bigger development was the continued and expanding interest of ice hockey for the student body. Undergraduates were so enamored with the idea of joining the team that a second squad of 34 men, completely separate from the Varsity and Freshman teams, was organized and a schedule arranged.\nAfter the rather poor effort in the B. A. A. game, Harvard exploded out of the gate against MIT and did not take the pressure off all game, ending with a dominant 11–1 victory. The convincing victory demonstrated how the good the team could be as they embarked on their first ever holiday trip over the winter break. They would play Syracuse HC and Ottawa each twice with the team being billeted at the home of team captain Willetts in nearby Skaneateles.\nThe trip started well with the team producing a solid win against the Syracuse Club, but afterwards the results turned sour. Syracuse earned a split with a 2–1 win, then Ottawa strangled the Crimson offense, not allowing a goal in either of the two matches. The defense from Harvard, provided mostly by Willetts and Clafin, was notable but the lack of scoring punch doomed the Crimson from the start. The terrible results portended a bad season for the Crimson, and once they began their intercollegiate schedule began those predictions bore fruit.\nHarvard could only just defeat Amherst a team they should have had not trouble against. Despite the close shaves, the Crimson alternates were gaining much needed game experience. Against Massachusetts Agricultural College the offense continued to struggle, showing up just in the nick of time to overcome a deficit in overtime and again escape with a one-goal victory. When the hosted Dartmouth the score was tight once more, but the team looked to be performing much more as a cohesive unit.\nTheir next game came against Princeton. Harvard had been a thorn in Princeton's side over the previous two years, being the only team to beat the Tigers the previous year. The Crimson defense had faced Princeton star Hobey Baker before and knew how to play against him. They used that experience to restrict the speedy Baker and keep the game tied for most of the contest. Even when Princeton opened the scoring it was a scant few minutes before the game was knotted at 1-all. Afterwards, no matter how hard the Tigers tried, they could not penetrate the stifling defense. A 14-minute overtime session was played to no effect, then an open-ended second overtime began and followed sudden-death rules. Harvard took full advantage of its many alternates while Princeton was forced to play with nearly the same seven players all game. The Tigers flagged from fatigue and in the 78th minute of what was scheduled as a 40-minute game, Saltonstall ended the game in Harvard's favor.\nHarvard dropped their next game to McGill but when they faced Yale the four goal effort from Hopkins gave Harvard a chance at a second consecutive intercollegiate title. The Crimson had played each game over the previous month at the Boston Arena, however, and now they would have a second chance to prove their mettle on the road. When they met Yale in New Haven the Crimson were not prepared for the hard checking from the Elis and Yale pushed Harvard around for most of the game.\nThree days later in a second rematch, Princeton could have tried to follow Yale's game plan but they stuck to their own high-octane game and simply outplayed the Crimson, scoring the final three goals in 4–2 victory. Worse for Harvard, Willetts and Philips were injured in the game and doubt was cast on their ability to compete in the final games against Princeton and Yale. Both players started the rubber match with Princeton a week later but it was clear that the Tigers were the better team. Despite keying their defense on Baker, the Tiger star could not be contained and assisted on three Princeton goals in a 4–1 victory.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

After a subpar end to their season, Harvard had ample reason to reclaim the intercollegiate championship.\nThe Crimson began the year with a convincing 6–2 win over MIT, scoring the first six goals and using the remainder of the game to ease their alternates into game action. The team lost a match against the Boston Athletic Association before pausing for the winter break.\nHarvard lost their first game back but recovered a few days later with a dominant performance against Cornell. The first big test for the team was against defending champion Princeton, but the Tigers were missing far too many players from the previous year to put up much of a fight. With Harvard sailing towards a championship they were shocked in their very next game by Dartmouth. Without a second game against the Greens, Harvard could only hope that Dartmouth would lose to keep the championship dreams alive.\nA sterling performance from Wylde allowed Harvard to complete the season sweep of Princeton. A week later the Elis came to town and Harvard once more proved the better team. After a shutout of Mass. Agg. Harvard was stymied by McGill, as they had been the year before, but the ensuing 9–1 win over Williams demonstrated that the Crimson was still atop their game.\nHarvard has an eleven day layoff leading to their rematch with Yale, and the game could scarce have meant more. Harvard was one win away from the IHL championship and, because of the Bulldogs' win over Dartmouth at the beginning of the month, the Crimson could finish with a 3-way split for the collegiate championship as well. Harvard's defense proved stout once more as the Crimson skated to a 3–1 win capturing the season series.\nWith Harvard, Dartmouth and Yale having defeated one another during the season, none had a solid claim for the Intercollegiate championship. A playoff was suggested to determine the sole champion between the three, however, Harvard disbanded their team shortly after defeating Yale with the expectation that the team would claim the championship.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "Herbert Dixon (1869 - 20 September 1952) was a Scottish rugby union player who became the 43rd President of the Scottish Rugby Union. He was, for a period, a director of the Adam Brothers shipping company, a family business.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nDixon played for London Scottish.\nReferee career.\nHe was a touch-judge for the Scotland versus France international in 1923. The other touch-judge representing the French Federation was C. F. Rutherford, a Scot who previously played for Racing Club and began the first secretary of the FFR, the referee was Welsh; Tommy Vile.\nAdministrative career.\nDixon was elected as Honorary Secretary of London Scottish in 1904. and 1905. In 1908, He put out a communication asking for Scots resident in London and interested in rugby union to contact him at his home address of 17 Gracechurch Street. The club would then hold a trial on Richmond Athletic Ground.\nIn 1910, Dixon stood as Honorary Secretary in place of R. O. Robertson.\nDixon was elected as Office-bearer in the Scottish Rugby Union for the London district in 1911, 1913, and 1914.\nHe was elected vice-president of the Scottish Rugby Union in 1921.\nHe was the Scottish Rugby Union president from 1922 to 1923.\nHe had to make a statement when both George Aitken and Johnnie Wallace left Blackheath to join London Scottish. The players were selected for a Scottish Trial side and then joined the London Scottish side as they thought it would further enhance their credentials for Scotland selection. Dixon stated that the players did this of their free will and that they stood the same chance of selection for Scotland at London Scottish as they did at any side. He stated that Aitken's parents were Scottish and his father still resided in Blairgowrie; and in the case of Wallace all four of his grandparents were Scottish. Rumours had abounded that the Scottish Rugby Union had coerced the move - Dixon described this sharply as 'a tissue of lies'. Not at issue: Aitken and Wallace had already represented New Zealand and Australia, respectively. At this time switching nationalities was pemissable - indeed Wallace switched back later to captain Australia.\nFamily and the Shipping business.\nDixon's grandfather was Thomas Adam of Eden, Aberdeenshire. Dixon is recorded going to his grandfather's funeral in 1893. Adam was in the shipping industry and his funeral was well attended by representatives from shipping companies and the shore porter's society. His sons Thomas Adam, Alexander Chivas Adam and John Birnie Adam took over the family business as the Adam Brothers shipping company.\nWilliam Scott Dixon was the son of Williamina (Mina) Adam (1840-1881) and Herbert Scott Dixon (1832-1879). Mina was the daughter of Thomas Adam of Eden, and the sister of the Adam Brothers. William has born in County Durham, sometime between July and September 1869, and was brought up in Banff.\nWith both parents and his grandfather dead, Dixon goes into the family business. Dixon's London address while at London Scottish is given as 17 Gracechurch Street. E.C. This is also the same address as the Adam Brothers, steamship owners.\nThe London city directory of 1913 has Dixon working for Adam Brothers at this address. In May 1914 Dixon was appointed to the board of this company.\nIt is noted that after the First World War, the company now in the hands of another grandson Thomas Livingstone Adam, fell into difficult times and was liquated in 1920.\nIn 1934, Dixon and his brother William Goodchild Dixon and his niece Mina Goodchild Dixon head to Buenos Aires on the Almeda Star. He arrives back in Liverpool, England in 1939."

While the NCAA's current three-division format has been in place since the 1973–74 season, the organization did not sponsor women's sports until the 1981–82 school year; before that time, women's college sports were governed by the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW).

Three points were now awarded for a win, one point for a tie and no points for a loss. The new method used was a convoluted arrangement where a team's conference record would still be recorded based upon the standard NCAA format where wins and losses accrued in the 5-minute 5-on-5 overtime were included in the win column. However, the CCC tracked overtime wins and losses so that if a team won a game in overtime they would receive two points instead of the normal three while if a team lost an overtime game they would receive a point. Teams that recorded a tie would follow a more typical situation where they would receive one additional point for a 3-on-3 overtime win or a shootout win but would not receive any additional points for a loss in either case.\nThe formula for the points standings were as follows: Points = (wins x 3) + (ties) – (5-on-5 overtime wins) + (5-on-5 overtime losses) + (3-on-3 overtime wins) + (shootout wins)"

He started his high school career at Potomac High School in Dumfries, Virginia, and transferred to Oak Hill Academy in Mouth of Wilson in his junior year, winning the Virginia Mr. Basketball award in his senior season in 2000. He then signed to play college basketball at Kentucky, where he stayed 4 years, advancing to the NCAA tournament Sweet Sixteen in 2001 and 2002 and to the Elite Eight in 2003. In 2004, his senior year at Kentucky, he was an all-conference selection. After going undrafted in the 2004 NBA draft Hawkins started his professional career in Italy with LegaDue team JuveCaserta. He has played in Italy, France, Croatia, Turkey, Japan, Poland, Cyprus and Georgia in his 8-year professional career.\nHigh school career.\nHawkins was born in Alexandria, Virginia, to Ricky Hunter and Monique Wilhite. A left-handed guard, he attended Potomac High School in Dumfries, where he was named in the Virginia All-AAA Second Team by the \"Washington Post\". Hawkins' sophomore year saw him averaging 19.3 points, 4.3 rebounds and 4.2 steals per game, shooting 58% from the field, and was named in the All-Met team selected by the \"Washington Post\", the first sophomore to receive a selection in an All-Met team. In the state semifinal against Hampton High School, Hawkins scored 31 points, and on the defensive side held All-American Ronald Curry to 6 points. Potomac reached the championship game, where they were defeated by George Washington High School of Danville. The \"Washington Post\" defined Hawkins the state's top sophomore, and he was a first-team Class AAA All-State selection.\nIn July 1998, the summer before his junior year, Hawkins participated in the ABCD Camp, a camp for the best high school players in the United States. Hawkins decided to transfer to Oak Hill Academy in Mouth of Wilson for his junior year; Oak Hill coach Steve Smith praised his all-around playing style, and particularly his on-ball defense skills. In his first season with the Warriors, he was the only non-senior player to be in the starting lineup, playing at shooting guard; he averaged 11.7 points, 2.3 rebounds, 5.4 assists and 3.9 steals (the best mark in the country), shooting 50% from thie field (30% from three) and 62.5% from the free throw line. He established a new Oak Hill record for steals in a single season with 120. In July 1999 Hawkins participated in the ABCD Camp for the second time in his career. Coach Smith moved Hawkins to point guard for his senior year, and Hawkins averaged a double double with 10.1 points and 12.5 assists per game: his 400 total assists were a new record for Oak Hill, as were his 167 steals (5.4 per game), which surpassed his own record of 120 established in the previous season. He also averaged 3.6 rebounds and shot 48% from the field and 66.7% from the free throw line. At the end of the season, Hawkins was named Oak Hill's Most Valuable Player and was named Virginia Mr. Basketball by the \"Roanoke Times\".\nHawkins was one of the top players in the country as a senior; scout Bob Gibbons compared him to Kentucky guard Wayne Turner, and he was ranked in the top 50 by several recruiting services. He was the 36th best player overall according to the Recruiting Services Consensus Index (RSCI), while \"Hoop Scoop\" ranked him 84th.\nCollege career.\nHawkins was recruited by many NCAA Division I schools: he had originally committed to play at New Mexico, but later signed with Kentucky in mid-November 1999, knowing that the program needed a point guard after the graduation of Wayne Turner. Hawkins decided to wear jersey number 1 for the Wildcats, and played 33 out of 34 possible games in his freshman year (11 minutes per game), being used as a reserve by head coach Tubby Smith. Hawkins scored his first points on November 21, 2000, against Jacksonville State, and also recorded 4 steals in 15 minutes in that game. He scored a season-high 11 points against North Carolina on December 2, 2000, and he had 7 assists against LSU on February 21, 2001. In the 2001 NCAA tournament Hawkins and the Wildcats reached the Sweet Sixteen, where they were eliminated by USC.\nIn his sophomore year, Hawkins saw increased playing time when coach Smith promoted him to a starting role. He started his first game against Western Kentucky on November 15, 2001, and December 18, 2001, he scored 15 points against Duke in an overtime loss; on December 22 he scored a career high 17 points against Indiana. On January 5, 2002, he recorded a career high in assists with 10 against Mississippi State, and one week later he scored a game winner against South Carolina. In the 2002 NCAA tournament Hawkins started all the games and averaged 6.3 points, 4.3 rebounds and 4.7 assists: the Wildcats were eliminated by Maryland in the Sweet Sixteen.\nHawkins had academic issues at the beginning of his junior year, and missed the first 7 games; he also lost his starting role in the lineup, and only started 1 game out of 29 appearances. Coach Smith used Hawkins as a sixth man and the guard had his best year in shooting, posting career highs in three-point field goal percentage (38.1%) and free throw percentage (74.7%). Hawkins reappeared on the court on December 21 against Indiana after missing the first games of the year, and scored 4 points and had 5 rebounds and 5 assists in 26 minutes of play. He then scored 14 points (a season high) on February 23, 2003, against Mississippi State, and he posted 9 assists in the SEC tournament win against Vanderbilt. In the 2003 NCAA tournament Hawkins debuted with 13 points and 6 assists in 22 minutes against IUPUI (2/3 from the three-point line), followed by another 13-point performance against Utah. He then scored 4 points (with 4 steals) against Wisconsin, and in the loss against Marquette he had 9 points, 2 rebounds and 3 assists in 27 minutes. At the end of the season he was an Honorable mention AP All-SEC selection, and he led his team in assists (3.8) and steals per game (1.4).\nHawkins gained back his starting assignments in his senior year, and he started at point guard all of his 32 appearances. Hawkins recorded career highs in all statistical categories with 30.6 minutes, 10.3 points, 2.9 rebounds, 5.2 assists, and 2.3 steals per game. He led the SEC in assists per game and total steals, while he was second in steals per game. During the 2004 NCAA tournament Hawkins debuted with 14 points and 4 assists against Florida A&amp;M, and ended his career at Kentucky with 9 points, 2 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 steals in 26 minutes in the loss against UAB. At the end of the season he was named in the All-SEC Third Team by the Associated Press. Hawkins scored a total of 839 points for the Wildcats, and ranks 7th all-time in total assists with 468, and 3rd in total steals with 199.\nProfessional career.\nAfter the end of his senior season at Kentucky, Hawkins was automatically eligible for the 2004 NBA draft, but he was not selected by an NBA franchise. In July 2004 Hawkins signed with JuveCaserta in Italy: in 4 LegaDue games he averaged 8.5 points, 1.8 rebounds 2.3 assists, and 3 steals per game in 30.3 minutes of playing time. He then left the team and joined the Yakima Sun Kings of the Continental Basketball Association. He played 27 games (11 starts) in the 2004–05 CBA season, averaging 12 points, 3.6 rebounds and 6.1 assists in 29.4 minutes per game. In spring-summer 2005 Hawkins participated in the 2005 United States Basketball League (USBL) season with the Dodge City Legend, winning the league title. In July he joined the New Jersey Nets for the Las Vegas NBA Summer League, where he played 5 games (4 starts) averaging 4.8 points, 1.4 rebounds and 1.2 assists per game.\nAfter a brief experience with Clermont-Ferrand in France, Hawkins joined the Fayetteville Patriots of the NBA Development League, and in the 2005–06 season he started in 9 out of his 14 appearances, averaging 9.5 points, 2.1 rebounds and 6.1 assists per game. Later that season he joined Cedevita, a team of the Croatian league, and in 14 games he averaged 10.9 points and 3.4 assists. He then spent the 2006–07 season in Turkey with Selçuk Üniversitesi, and over 11 games in the Turkish Basketball League he posted averages of 11.5 points, 3.5 rebounds and 4.9 assists per game on 32.4 minutes of playing time.\nHawkins moved to Japan in 2007 and signed a contract with OSG Phoenix of the Japan Basketball League. In the 2007–08 season he led the league in assists (7.5) and steals per game (2.3). He then went back to Europe and signed with Polish PLK team Bank BPS Kwidzyn, and in his first season in Poland he averaged 6.9 points, 2.2 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 1.9 steals per game. He then joined another PLK team, Trefl Sopot, which were playing their inaugural season. He was a full-time starter with the new team, and averaged 10.3 points, 3.8 assists and 1.8 steals per game in 36 appearances.\nAfter briefly playing for AEL Limassol in Cyprus, Hawkins spent the 2010–11 season back in Poland, this time with PBG Poznań where he posted averages of 6.8 points, 3 rebounds and 4 assists over 25 games. In 2011 he moved to another European country, Georgia, and signed with BC Armia of Tbilisi.

For his senior season, Johnson transferred to Bemidji State and was the team's leader in assists and an all-conference honorable mention.\nCoaching career.\nJohnson would stay on Bemidji State's bench following his senior year as a one-year stop as an assistant coach before moving on to Southwest Baptist as an assistant from 2004 to 2007, where he was part of a Bearcats MAIAA team which made the NCAA Division II Tournament. After a one-year stop at Cal State Northridge where he tied for first in the Big West Conference , Johnson would join Jim Boylen's staff at Utah. In 2008–09, the Utes won a share of the Mountain West Conference Championship and the postseason conference tournament title. Utah finished the season ranked No. 25 in the AP poll and earned a No. 5 seed in the Midwest Region, at the time the highest seed ever given to a Mountain West team. He landed at Drake for an assistant coaching spell from 2011 to 2013 before joining Herb Sendek's staff at Arizona State, where he remained until 2015, helping guide the Sun Devils to an NCAA Tournament appearance in 2014. In 2015, Johnson joined Steve Wojciechowski's staff at Marquette, and was a part of two Golden Eagles NCAA tournament teams. Johnson was responsible for recruiting Markus Howard to Arizona State and, ultimately, Marquette where Howard became a consensus First Team All-American selection as a senior.\nOn March 20, 2020, Johnson was named the head coach at Loyola Marymount, replacing Mike Dunlap."

The snowboard cross route is 980 meters long and the parallel slalom route is 280 meters long.\nHistory.\nSnowboarding was added to the FIS competition program in May 1994. The first Snowboard World Championship was held in 1996.\nIn the 2010/11 season, the Snowboard Cross World Cup was held in Lech am Arlberg, before it continued to be held in Montafon. There, the first Snowboard Cross World Cup took place in December 2012.\nIn December 2014, the snowboard cross had to be cancelled due to warm temperatures. Instead, a parallel slalom and mixed team competition were held. In 2018, snow production was impossible for the track, due to warm temperatures once again, so that year the snowboard cross had to be cancelled.\nIn the season 2020/21, due to policies regarding COVID-19, all races in Montafon (FIS Ski Cross Weltcup, FIS Snowboard Cross World Cup) had to be postponed to 15 and 16 January 2021, and later be cancelled completely.

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Rams represent the University of Rhode Island in the NCAA's Atlantic 10 Conference.\nRhode Island began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1903. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Rhode Island's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

He'd follow Anderson to Jackson State and stay for six seasons until joining the staff of Grand Canyon, then an NCAA Division II under his former Ole Miss assistant Russ Pennell. After the 2014 season, Boone would follow Pennell again as he became head coach of the WNBA's Phoenix Mercury for a short spell in 2013.\nWhen Pennell landed the Central Arkansas job, Boone joined him once more as an assistant coach. After a 1–8 start to the 2019–20 season, Pennell took a leave of absence in December 2019 and eventually resigned in January 2020, with Boone taking over on an interim basis.

He also served as a Director and Chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nTulloch played with Kelvinside Academicals.\nHe had to resign from the captaincy and his playing career after an injury he sustained playing against Royal HSFP on 5 October 1901. It was remarked that Tulloch was one of the best Three Quarters had Scotland had produced for many years; and that the injury was more serious than originally anticipated. John Knox would take over the captaincy of the club.\nProvincial career.\nTulloch played in 1900 inter-city match for Glasgow District\nTulloch played for the Cities District in 1899. He played again for Cities in 1901. He suffered an injury and strained his tendon.\nInternational career.\nHe was twice selected for Scotland but on both occasions injury ruined his chances of a Scotland cap.\nTulloch was due to get a Scotland cap against Wales in 1899 after impressing in the Cities versus Provinces match and was in the original selection. \"The Scottish Referee\" journalist concluded that 'J. T Tulloch has earned his place through sheer merit and I would be terribly disappointed if he did not add to his reputation in the Wales match'.\nDue to the injury Tulloch picked up in the 1901 Cities v Provinces match, although he was originally selected for Scotland duty Tulloch had to withdraw from the Scotland Home Nations side. A. N. Fell was selected in his place.\nReferee career.\nAfter Tulloch's playing career was ended abruptly due to injury he became an international referee. He refereed Scottish Districts matches.\nHe refereed 9 test matches in all.\nOne famous match he was scheduled to referee - but did not - was the Ireland v South Africa match of 1912. The Scottish Rugby Union offered Tulloch when the English referee Frank Potter-Irwin fell sick. Some reports still have Tulloch refereeing the first half; but in fact it was John Dallas, another Scottish referee, that took Tulloch's place. The match was notable, not only for a South Africa emphatic win, but because Dallas could not continue for the second half and an Irish referee had to take over for the second half. It was the first time a referee was substituted in a test match.\nTulloch did referee the England v South Africa match of the 1912-13 season tour.\nAdministrative career.\nTulloch became the Vice-President of the Scottish Rugby Union in 1905.\nHe became the 33rd President of the Scottish Rugby Union. He served one year from 1906 to 1907.\nFinancial career.\nTulloch became a Charted Accountant. He became a Director of the Royal Bank of Scotland; and served as the Bank's chairman of the board for two terms. He resigned his position of Ordinary Board Member in March 1943 due to ill-health; but was then immediately elected an Extraordinary Board Member.\nTulloch died later that year. The bank stated: we mourn the loss of a valued colleague of engaging personality whose wide experience of men and affairs was always at the service of the bank. The following year Lord Elgin gave a moving eulogy to Tulloch and quoted a poem by Henry van Dyke Jr. to honour him.\nOutside of rugby and finance.\nTulloch was added as a Director of Kelvinside Academy in December 1913, alongside James Greenlees. Another famous Scottish rugby union player Douglas Schulze was the Academy rector at the time.\nTulloch gave a lot of his time to the Boys Brigade. A company officer, he then became Treasurer and finally President of the Glasgow battalion."

        "text": "An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each team position—who in turn are given the honorific \"All-America\" and typically referred to as \"All-American athletes\", or simply \"All-Americans\". Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. The 2020 NCAA Women's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that include All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), and the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) for the 2019–20 NCAA Division I women's basketball season. Both AP and USBWA choose three teams, while WBCA lists 10 honorees.\nA consensus All-America team in women's basketball has never been organized. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by AP, USBWA, the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), and \"Sporting News\" to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus All-America men's basketball team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.\nBefore the 2017–18 season, it was impossible for a consensus women's All-America team to be determined because the AP had been the only body that divided its women's selections into separate teams. The USBWA first named separate teams in 2017–18. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA), continues the USBWA's former practice of selecting a single 10-member (plus ties) team. \"Sporting News\" does not select an All-America team in women's basketball.\nAcademic All-Americans.\nThe College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) announced its 15-member 2020 Academic All-America team on March 9, 2020, divided into first, second and third teams with Brittany Brewer of Texas Tech chosen as women's college basketball Academic All-American of the Year.\nWhen a player is listed with two grade-point averages, the first is her undergraduate GPA. Players listed with two majors separated by a slash are double majors unless explicitly designated as undergraduate and graduate programs.\n\"Notes\":\nSenior All-Americans.\nThe finalists for the Senior CLASS Award, called Senior All-Americans, were announced on February 5, 2020. Due to a tie in voting, 11 finalists were named instead of the normal 10. \nOn March 31, Sabrina Ionescu was announced as the recipient, with the first and second teams also announced at that time."

However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Duke's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.

The slow return allowed Princeton to restart many of its athletic programs, including the ice hockey team. There was a predictable delay before the team was formed and able to play its first game, but an agreement was reached with Harvard and Yale where each squad would play the other two.\nPrinceton's first game came against the St. Nicholas Hockey Club with the Tigers taking an early lead. After the opposing captain was injured and was forced to leave the game, Princeton agreed to play the remainder of the contest 6-on-6. The speed of St. Nicholas allowed them to carry the play for the balance of the game and finish with a 6–4 victory over Princeton. After losing a close practice game against the Brooklyn Hockey Club, Princeton was outplayed by Yale in a 1–6 loss.\nThe final game was a route at the hands of Harvard with the Crimson winning 7–2.

        "text": "The ISSF World Cup was introduced by the International Shooting Sport Federation in 2016 to provide an equivalent competition to the ISSF World Cup, but for junior shooters. It covers a variety of both Olympic and non-Olympic events in rifle, pistol and shotgun, and covers one or two competitions per year in each event. Unlike in the senior version of the event, there is currently no junior world cup final.\nUnder the 2023 ISSF rules, an athlete ceases to be a 'junior' on December 31 of the year they turn 21. This means they can still participate in Junior events for that year, even if they turned 21 on January 1st. Previous rules had defined a junior as an athlete who would be under the age of 21 on December 31st of the competition year, meaning they could not compete as a junior in that year even before their birthday.\nSeasons and venues.\nThe venues are decided by the ISSF from time to time. However, some are more common than others. Save for the 2017 world cup, Suhl in Germany has hosted a competition every year. Other stages of the competition have been held both in and out of Europe: for example in Porpetto, Gabala and Sydney.\nNote that the 2017 world cup consisted of only shotgun events, as the Junior World Championships of the same year covered rifle and pistol events.\nEvents.\nThe following events have all featured in the ISSF Junior World Cup in recent years:"

        "title": "Kiss My Super Bowl Ring",
        "text": "Kiss My Super Bowl Ring is the fourth studio album by American experimental rock duo The Garden. The album was released on March 13, 2020 through Epitaph Records.\nBackground.\nThe album was announced on January 16, 2020 along with the release of the lead-off single, \"Clench to Stay Awake\". Promotional pictures and videos showed the band in an abandoned, dilapidated house, and the band interacting with a goblin-like creature.\nAs with the band's previous releases, the album is self produced; however, the tracks \"Hit Eject\" and \"Lurkin'\" were produced by 100 gecs member Dylan Brady, and the track \"Sneaky Devil\" was produced by Kero Kero Bonito member Jamie Bulled under his solo project WHARFWHIT.\nComposition.\nMusic.\n\"Kiss My Super Bowl Ring\" features a significantly heavier sound and tone than its predecessor. The album's musical style, in contrast to the band's lighter and more melodic \"Mirror Might Steal Your Charm\", \"Kiss My Super Bowl Ring\" exhibits more of a straightforward \"punk\" style, exploring some of the rawer sides of the band’s \"vada vada\" style. A major influence on the album was crust punk, in which Wyatt stated in a Reddit AMA was inspired by bands such as Dystopia, Rudimentary Peni, and Antischism. Many songs off the album also exhibit influences from genres as diverse as post-punk, aggressive drum and bass (a staple in The Garden's music), and even surf music in some of the guitar parts. The drums and vocals provided by Fletcher, and the guitar and bass work provided by Wyatt are significantly more abrasive. Many of the songs feature shrieked vocals, fast tremolo picking, and blast beats that are reminiscent of black metal, but many songs also feature a handful of rapping in the album’s more electronic sounds.\nLyrics.\nThe lyrics on \"Kiss My Super Bowl Ring\", as previous albums do, follow a running motif of self-confidence and perseverance, with \"Clench to Stay Awake\" featuring lyrics of overcoming physical obstacles. Despite some songs containing more positive messages, a majority of songs features pessimistic and bleak lyrics, with songs like \"A Struggle,\" \"Sneaky Devil\", and \"Please, Fuck Off\" all having a theme of struggling with distaste for ones self and others. The title track, as well as the album title and the phrase itself, means \"kiss my ass\".\nCritical reception.\n\"Kiss My Super Bowl Ring\" received generally favorable reviews from contemporary music critics. On review aggregator website, Metacritic, the album has an average rating of 71 out of 100 indicating \"generally favorable reviews based on 5 critics\". On \"Album of the Year\", the album has an average rating of 65 out of 100 based on eight critic reviews.\nWriting for, \"Exclaim!\", Spencer Nafekh-Blanchette, gave \"Kiss My Super Bowl Ring\" a positive review, praising the seamless fusions of genre-crossing and the chemistry between Wyatt and Fletcher Shears. Nafekh-Blanchette said the album is \"their most viscerally intense release thus far\". Further, Nafekh-Blanchette said that the album \"has the Garden screaming as much as they are singing, and transitioning between the two within a matter of seconds. Somehow, the Shears brothers are able to make it work\". Nafekh-Blanchette gave the album an 8 out of 10.\nIn a mixed review, Abby Jones, writing for \"Pitchfork\" said that \"Kiss My Super Bowl Ring\" is \"proudly defiant; the title, Wyatt has clarified, essentially means “kiss my ass.” But where deviation from the norm has spawned countless artistic geniuses, Super Bowl Ring too often comes off as just a hodgepodge of ideas. “Vada vada,” it seems, has hurt the Garden as much as it's helped them.\" Jones ultimately gave the album a 6.4 out of 10.\nMaria Lewczyk, writing for \"NME\", gave the album four stars out of five. Lewczyk praised the music's unique sound compared to many of their rock music contemporaries. Of the sound, Lewczyk said, \"you get the overarching sense that they are more than a little bored with the current musical landscape and want to inject it with their own restless brand of creativity. If this is art rock, then the Shears brothers have crafted a pretty damn impressive collage.\"\nPersonnel.\nThe following individuals were credited with the production of the album:"

        "title": "Race Across the World series 1",
        "text": "The first series of \"Race Across the World\" first aired on BBC Two from 3 March to 7 April 2019. Five pairs of racers travelled from London to Singapore, with the contestants each given £1,329 for the whole race without using air transport. The racers travelled over a distance of 12,000 miles in 50 days.\nThe first series featured five pairs of competitors at the start of the race: Natalie and Shameema, Jinda and Bindu, Darron and Alex, Josh and Felix, and Sue and Clare. Jinda and Bindu withdrew due to family illness in the first episode, and were replaced by Elaine and Tony. Sue and Clare were eliminated when they finished last in Baku. Retired PE teachers Elaine and Tony Teasdale were the first to reach the final checkpoint in Singapore, and were crowned the winners.\nThe series was the most successful debut for a factual entertainment show on BBC Two in over three years, and one of the most-watched shows of the year for the channel.\nResults summary.\nColour key:\nRoute.\nThe checkpoints in the first series are:\nRace summary.\nLeg 1: London → Delphi.\nThe race started from Old Royal Naval College in London, finishing the first leg at the Amalia Hotel in Delphi, Greece.\nJosh and Felix made it to Calais on the first day and went down to Munich on the second. They worked in a farm outside Munich and gained a significant increase in cash. They quickly spent this on a train to Budapest and a coach to Athens, swapping buses to reach Delphi on the sixth day.\nDarron and Alex went on an overnight coach to Düsseldorf on Day One followed by another coach to Budapest, before catching a train to Belgrade. They were forced to splash out on a taxi to avoid being delayed in the Balkans, arriving 4 hours behind the leaders.\nAfter a slow start, Natalie &amp; Shameema took the ferry to Calais on Day Two before working in Lyon. They then went via Milan and over to the ferry port of Brindisi. They were the third team to reach Delphi.\nSue and Claire went via Lille and Paris to reach Milan, then travelled to Venice to catch a ferry to Greece. They arrived in Delphi 24 hours behind Josh and Felix.\nJinda and Bindu caught the ferry to Calais on Day One and made it to Aachen on the evening of Day 2, but returned home after receiving news of a family illness. Tony and Elaine took their place and went through France, Germany and into Italy and caught a ferry to Greece. They reached Delphi just a few minutes after Sue and Claire.\nLeg 2: Delphi → Baku.\nThe teams were informed that whoever arrived in Baku last would be eliminated. The two leading teams Josh &amp; Felix and Darron &amp; Alex took a boat to Çeşme, and then to Ankara where they took a slow Eastern Express train to Kars, which allowed the other teams to catch up. Fearing they were at risk of finishing fifth, Josh &amp; Felix took an expensive taxi ride from Tbilisi to Baku.\nAll the other teams chose the land route via Istanbul, where Natalie &amp; Shameema worked to earn some money. As they came last in the previous leg, Elaine &amp; Tony chose to travel non-stop by train and bus to Tbilisi, and managed to reach Baku in first place on Day 13. In contrast, Sue &amp; Clare decided to take a break in Tbilisi after a long bus journey, which resulted in their elimination.\nLeg 3: Baku → Tashkent.\nAll four teams ended up on the same ferry from the Port of Baku in Älät to Kuryk. However, due to a storm on the Caspian Sea, they had to stay on the ship for five days.\nOn reaching Kazakhstan, three teams travelled through Uzbekistan from its western border with Kazakhstan to Tashkent. Only Josh &amp; Felix chose the more northerly route through Kazakhstan. They stopped in Shymkent and travelled to watch a game of kokpar. Although their journey was longer, they arrived at the checkpoint at Tashkent only a couple of minutes behind Elaine &amp; Tony.\nElaine &amp; Tony travelled by taxis exclusively over a thousand miles from Kazakhstan until Samarkand, partly financing their spending spree by working as farm hands at a nomadic camp in the Kyzylkum Desert. Although both Darron &amp; Alex and Elaine &amp; Tony reached Samarkand around the same time, Darron &amp; Alex managed to get an earlier train to Tashkent and so arrived first at the checkpoint at Hotel Uzbekistan. Darron &amp; Alex also managed to work in a paper factory in Nukus. This was not televised, but was revealed in an interview with Alex.\nNatalie &amp; Shameema took advantage of a free car ride from Kuryk; however, their departure was delayed for 36 hours while their driver made arrangements for his trip. He then paused in Khiva while waiting for word from a friend, so the pair decided to continue by train, but still finished in last place.\nLeg 4: Tashkent → Huangyao.\nAll teams travelled to Almaty in Kazakhstan to cross into China, via the Khorgas Border Crossing. Natalie &amp; Shameema stopped in Almaty to visit the Shymbulak ski resort. All teams had to pass through Xinjiang—one of the autonomous regions of China and a politically sensitive region, which did not permit filming.\nDarron &amp; Alex went to Chengdu, where they worked in a flower shop to earn money, before using local knowledge to find the fastest connections. They reached Huangyao on Day 35, a day before the other teams. All the other teams travelled to Xi'an before heading south to Guilin in Guangxi, although Natalie &amp; Shameema went to Jiayuguan first to see the Great Wall of China at Jiayu Pass. After arriving in Guilin, Josh &amp; Felix decided to spend time and money going rock climbing at Yangshuo.\nIn order to save money, Tony &amp; Elaine travelled on a slow train to Guilin, and took a break there. At the end of this episode, Tony &amp; Elaine had still not arrived at the checkpoint. Their arrival was shown in the following episode, at which point it was confirmed that they were 38.5 hours behind leaders Darron &amp; Alex, who had already departed on the next leg.\nLeg 5: Huangyao → Koh Rong.\nElaine &amp; Tony were a long way behind the other teams, so they decided to spend money on taxis and express train to reach Vietnam on the same day they left the checkpoint before the border closed for the night. They were the only team to succeed in this effort, and made up much of the time lost during the previous leg.\nDarron &amp; Alex, despite a 22-hour advantage on their closest rivals, had to work in Hội An selling sugarcane juice as they were running low on funds, which allowed Elaine &amp; Tony to catch up with them and they crossed the Cambodian border on the same bus. Darron &amp; Alex decided to work for bed and board at an elephant sanctuary in Mondul Kiri while Elaine &amp; Tony worked in a rice field in Kratié, but both teams took the same boat to Koh Rong and came in joint first place.\nBoth Josh &amp; Felix and Natalie &amp; Shameema opted for the southern route, and ended up on the same train to Ho Chi Minh City. They were delayed on the train by a typhoon for 14 hours, and arrived at Koh Rong on the same boat.\nLeg 6: Koh Rong → Singapore.\nBoth Elaine &amp; Tony and Natalie &amp; Shameema spent funds on taxis to the Cambodian border. Darron &amp; Alex and Josh &amp; Felix had less money, and had to take a longer route to Bangkok via Phnom Penh. As Darron &amp; Alex had little money left, they worked in Bangkok as dog walkers at a dog training centre. Tony injured his back while on the bus, and was forced to take a break in Krabi. However, Elaine &amp; Tony managed to get the last seats on the direct bus to Singapore from Hat Yai. Although their bus broke down in Malaysia, they were the first team to reach the last checkpoint on the observation deck at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, ahead of Darron &amp; Alex.\nNearly out of cash, Josh &amp; Felix had to work in a hostel in Krabi. They eventually finished last, and did not have enough money to reach the final checkpoint. However, they were given the money by Natalie &amp; Shameema so they could complete the race.\nReception.\n\"Race Across the World\" has received generally positive reviews mixed with some negative reviews. Michael Hogan of \"The Telegraph\" found the first series \"fiendishly addictive\", and thought that it \"reaffirmed one's faith in human nature\" where friendships are \"formed across cultural divides\", with the series ending on an act of kindness that was \"apt\" and \"heartwarming\". Jeff Robson of the \"i\" newspaper regarded the series \"flawed but engaging\", and considered that although the show lacked the \"challenges of some extreme travelogues, nor the sense of peril\", it \"succeeded in recreating the combination of unexpected highlights, soul-destroying lows and crucial budget decisions which characterised old-school seat of the pants travel\". Carol Midgley of \"The Times\" regarded the challenge of racing to be \"quite tough\" and \"dramatic\".\nRatings.\nThe first episode had an overnight viewing figure of 1.5 million. The audience grew over the weeks, and in the final episode, it had an overnight viewing figure of 2.4 million."

        "text": "The 2020–21 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team represented Michigan State University in the 2020–21 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Spartans were led by 26th-year head coach Tom Izzo and played their home games at Breslin Center in East Lansing, Michigan as members of the Big Ten Conference.\nThe Spartans finished the regular season 15–13, 9–11 in Big Ten play to finish in a tie for eighth place. The 9–11 finish marked the first time the Spartans had finished with a record under .500 in conference play under Izzo. As the No. 9 seed in the Big Ten tournament, they lost to No. 8-seeded Maryland marking the first time the Spartans did not play in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten tournament in the tournament's history. The Spartans received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as the No. 11 seed in the East region. The selection marked the school's 23rd straight tournament appearance. In their First Four matchup, they were defeated by UCLA.\nWith Duke failing to make the NCAA tournament, Izzo took over the streak for the longest consecutive appearances in the tournament by a coach with 23.\nPrevious season.\nThe Spartans finished the 2019–20 season 22–9, 14–6 in Big Ten play to earn a share of their third straight Big Ten regular season championship. Their season ended following the cancellation of postseason tournaments due to the coronavirus pandemic. MSU was led by Cassius Winston who averaged 18.6 points and 5.9 assists per game and Xavier Tillman who averaged 13.7 points and 10.3 rebounds per game.\nCOVID-19 issues.\nOn November 9, it was announced that Tom Izzo had tested positive for COVID-19 and would quarantine for 14 days. Izzo returned to the team on November 23.\nOn January 13, 2021, the school announced that Izzo's son, walk-on Stephen Izzo had tested positive for the virus. Freshman center Mady Sissoko also tested positive for the virus. Both players would be required to quarantine and sit out for 17 days. That same day, a third player tested positive for Michigan State leading to the postponement of the Iowa game on January 14. The next day the school postponed its January 17 game against Indiana. On January 18, the school announced that three more members of the MSU program, including walk-on Davis Smith, had tested positive the day before and that the game against Illinois on January 23 would also be postponed.\nShortly before returning to play on January 28, the school announced that Gabe Brown and assistant coach Dane Fife had tested positive and would miss further time due to COVID-19 protocols.\nOffseason.\nDepartures.\nMSU lost consensus All-American point guard and all-time Big Ten leader in assists, Cassius Winston to graduation. Winston scored 1,969 points and dished out 890 assists in his four-year career at MSU. Winston was picked with the 53rd overall pick in the NBA draft by the Oklahoma City Thunder. He was then traded to the Washington Wizards.\nReserve guard Kyle Ahrens and forward Conner George also graduated from MSU.\nJunior forward Xavier Tillman announced on March 24, 2020, that he would explore the NBA draft process, but would not sign with an agent, leaving the possibility he could return to play in the 2020–21 season. On August 2, Tillman announced he would stay in the NBA draft, thereby ending his collegiate career. Tillman was selected with the 35th overall pick in the NBA draft by the Sacramento Kings. He was then traded to the Memphis Grizzlies.\nSophomore guard Aaron Henry announced he would enter the NBA draft as well, but would also leave open the ability to return to school. Also on August 2, Henry announced he was withdrawing from the NBA draft and would return to Michigan State.\nWalk-on red-shirt junior center Braden Burke entered his name in the transfer portal on April 10 and announced he was transferring to Central Michigan on April 25.\nRecruiting classes.\n2020 recruiting class.\nOn April 2, 2019, days after the Spartans advanced to the Final Four, four-start point guard Jalen Terry announced he would sign to play with the Spartans in 2020. However, on October 15, Terry announced he would reopen his recruiting and decommitted from MSU. On September 9, four-star center Mady Sissoko committed to MSU. On October 6, four-star point guard A. J. Hoggard announced he intended to play with MSU in 2020.\nIncoming transfers.\nOn May 28, 2019, Marquette forward Joey Hauser announced he would transfer to MSU. Due to NCAA transfer rules, Hauser had to sit out the 2019–20 season, but will have at least two years of eligibility left beginning in the 2020–21 season.\nEarly offseason rankings.\nIn April 2020, most early pollsters listed Michigan State as a preseason top-15 team for the 2020–21 season. These included ESPN (No. 8), Sports Illustrated (No. 11), Yahoo! Sports (No. 13), USA Today (No. 19), NBC Sports (No. 5), and CBS Sports (No. 12).\nPreseason.\nPreseason rankings.\nMSU was ranked No. 13 in the preseason AP Poll. The Spartans were ranked 12th in the preseason Coaches Poll.\nPreseason Big Ten polls.\nAaron Henry was the lone Spartan representative on the preseason Big Ten poll chosen by a panel of conference media members.\nCBS Sports picked MSU to finish fourth in the conference.\nPrior to the start of the season, unofficial awards and a poll were chosen by a panel of 28 writers, two for each team in the conference. Michigan State was picked to finish in fourth.\nInjuries.\nOn November 9, 2020, Tom Izzo announced that freshman AJ Hoggard underwent knee surgery, but was not expected to miss any games.\nRegular season.\nNon-conference games.\nEastern Michigan.\nMSU began their 2020–21 season on November 25 at home in front of no fans at the Breslin Center against Eastern Michigan. Foster Loyer got the start for the Spartans and scored a career-high 20 points on six three-pointers. The Eagles kept it close throughout the first half, but the Spartans pulled away for a 16-point advantage at half time. The Eagles never threatened again, as MSU held on for the 83–67 win. Joey Hauser scored 15 points and grabbed nine rebounds. Joshua Langford, in his first gameplay in almost two years, added 10 points on two of seven shooting from three. The win gave the Spartans a 1–0 record to begin the season.\nNotre Dame.\nTwo days after Thanksgiving, MSU welcomed Notre Dame to Breslin. In a similar story to the EMU game, Notre Dame kept the game close before MSU closed the first half on a 17–0 run to take a 13-point halftime lead. MSU kept up the strong defense in the second half, scoring the first nine points in the half to push the lead to 22 points over the Fighting Irish. Aaron Henry led the Spartans with 14 points and added three assists. Joey Hauser notched 16 rebounds and 10 points as MSU pushed the lead to nearly 30 before relaxing and substituting heavily. Rocket Watts also played well, scoring 13 points and handing out a game-high six assists as the Spartans won 80–70. The win pushed MSU to 2–0 on the young season.\nDuke.\nAs part of the re-worked Champions Classic, MSU traveled to Duke to face the Blue Devils on December 1. Once again, MSU trailed early falling behind by 10 points in the first 10 minutes. However, the Spartans again turned up the defensive pressure and the offense came alive, led by Julius Marble who scored a career-high 12 points in 12 minutes of action. The Spartans went to the half leading by four and pushed the lead to as many as 16 in the second half as Aaron Henry scored 14 points and notched five assists while Rocket Watts scored 20. Malik Hall and Joey Hauser each had a double-double as the Spartans won easily 75–69. The win marked MSU's first-ever victory at Cameron Indoor Stadium and was only the third time an Izzo-led squad defeated Duke. The win moved MSU to 3–0 on the season.\nDetroit Mercy.\nThe Spartans returned home to play Detroit Mercy for the first time since 1997 on December 4. Despite being a heavy favorite, the Spartans could never pull away from the Titans and the game was tied at 35 at the half. Rocket Watts took over in the second half, scoring a team-high 23, many of which came late in the game as the Spartans were able to hold off Detroit Mercy for the 83–76 win. Gabe Brown started in the place of Josh Langford who sat out the game due to a sore knee which Tom Izzo said was a mere precaution. Brown scored 16 points while Aaron Henry added 12 points. The win moved MSU to 4–0 on the season.\nWestern Michigan.\nTwo days later, Western Michigan came to Breslin for their Second game of the season after spending a week off due to COVID-19 cancellations. The Broncos also gave the Spartans hard time, keeping the game within 10 points until less than 10 minutes remained. Joey Hauser notched a career-high 24 points on six of 10 shooting from three. Gabe Brown again got the start, this time starting in place of Aaron Henry who had arrived late to a film session earlier. The Spartans were finally able to take control of the game in the final 10 minutes, winning by 18, 79–61. The win moved the Spartans to 5–0 on the season.\nOakland.\nAfter traveling to Virginia for a game that was postponed the night before it was scheduled to take place, the Spartans returned home without playing a game. On December 13, the No. 4-ranked Spartans returned to play against Oakland whom the Spartans were 18–0 all-time against. The Spartans started well, taking an early lead, but could not put much distance between themselves and the Golden Grizzlies. MSU led by only four at the half and struggled defensively throughout, eventually allowing Oakland to score 91 points. MSU did pull away early in the second half with a 13–0 run and outscored Oakland by 14 in the half. Led by Gabe Brown's career-high 20 points, Aaron Henry added 15 points while seven Spartans scored in double figures. The 109–91 win moved MSU to 6–0 on the season.\nConference games.\nNorthwestern.\nAfter a week off for finals, the Spartans opened Big Ten play with a trip to Northwestern. MSU, as it had done the majority of the season, quickly fell behind to the Wildcats. Having last lost to Northwestern in 2012, the Spartans trailed by 13 at the half. MSU's defense struggled mightily, allowing Northwestern to shoot 52.9% from the field and 47.6% from three. Meanwhile, the Spartan offense was even worse. MSU made only eight of 31 three-point attempts and shot under 39% from the field in the game. Northwestern pushed their lead to as many as 21 in the second half and answered every push MSU made, keeping MSU trailing by double digits through most of the second half. Aaron Henry led the Spartans with 11 points while Gabe Brown added 10. However, Rocket Watts and Joey Hauser could only manage five points each. As a result, MSU lost 79–65, marking their first loss on the season and dropping them to 6–1 and 0–1 in conference play. Tom Izzo commented, \"That was one of the more inept performances of my 26 years.\"\nWisconsin.\nAfter dropping to No. 12 in the polls, the Spartans returned home to faced No. 9-ranked Wisconsin. The game stayed close throughout the first half as both offenses played well, scoring 42 points each in the first half. In the second half, the Spartans took a nine-point lead and looked to pull away, but the Badgers quickly rallied. MSU made eight of 11 three-pointers in the game including three for Joey Hauser, but their defense continued to struggle. MSU allowed the Badgers to shoot over 50% from the field as Wisconsin retook the lead and pulled away for a nine-point victory, 85–76. Hauser scored 27 points for MSU while Henry scored 12, but no other Spartan managed more than eight points in the second straight loss. The loss moved the Spartans to 6–2 on the season and 0–2 in conference play.\nMinnesota.\nThe Spartans went on the road to face No. 21-ranked Minnesota on December 28. Minnesota took an early lead and did not look back, blowing out the Spartans 81–56. MSU struggled mightily on offense, managing only 16 points in the first half and shooting 25% from the field in the game. Aaron Henry did not start the game because Tom Izzo chose to start Josh Langford after Rocket Watts asked Izzo to not play point guard. Henry did lead the Spartans in scoring with 11 points while no other Spartans scored in double figures. Joey Hauser, coming off a career-high 27 points against Wisconsin, managed only six points on 1–8 shooting. The loss dropped the Spartans to 6–3 overall and 0–3 in Big ten play for the first time since 2002. The win was the largest margin of victory for Minnesota over MSU ever.\nNebraska.\nThe Spartans next traveled to Nebraska on January 2. The Spartans offense recovered well with AJ Hoggard making his first career start and Rocket Watts coming off the bench. The Spartans scored 40 points in the first half against the Cornhuskers, but could not put them away, allowing Nebraska to shoot 49% from the field. The Spartans took a lead as big as 18 in the second half, but Nebraska prevented the Spartans from turning the game into a rout. Aaron Henry scored a career-high 27 points for MSU while Joshua Langford added 15 and Gabe Brown scored 10. Joey Hauser struggled, scoring only five points in 20 minutes while Watts scored nine in just 15 minutes. Watts was in the game late as the point guard to protect the lead. The Spartans pulled out a narrow 84–77 win to notch their first Big Ten win on the season. They moved to 7–3 overall with the win.\nRutgers.\nThe Spartans, having dropped to a No. 23 ranking, returned home to face No. 15 Rutgers. MSU jumped out to an early 11–4 lead and led throughout. Aaron Henry again led the Spartans in scoring with 20 points, but MSU only led by six at the half. However, MSU's defense stifled the Scarlet Knights holding them to 30.5% shooting in the game and 25% from three. Joshua Langford and Rocket Watts added 11 points each as MSU blew out Rutgers 68–45. The Knights shot an abysmal six of 17 from the free throw line while the Spartans made 16 of 19 from the line. Joey Hauser added nine points and 14 rebounds as MSU outrebounded the Knights by 20. The win moved MSU to 8–3 on the season and 2–3 in conference play.\nPurdue.\nThe Spartans next faced Purdue on January 8. MSU started well despite being much smaller than Purdue's frontline players, Tom Izzo played Julius Marble, Maddy Sissoko, and Marcus Bingham significant minutes in the first half. MSU's big men limited Purdue's offensive punch in the half as the Spartans limited the Boilermakers to 26% shooting in the first half while the Spartans shot over 52% from the field. As a result, the Spartans led by 15 at the half. In what looked like would be an easy win, Izzo confusingly did not play Marble, Sissoko, or Bingham in the second half while Purdue's big man Trevion Williams ended with 26 points, 22 of them in the second half. MSU still held on to the lead with less than a minute remaining, but missed free throws by Aaron Henry, AJ Hoggard, and Rocket Watts left the door open for Williams who sank the go-ahead shot with 4.5 seconds left. Henry's rush down the court and ensuing shot rimmed off as MSU lost 55–54. The loss, after leading by as many as 17 was \"[o]ne of the more disappointing losses\" according to Izzo. The loss dropped MSU to 2–4 in conference and 8–4 overall and resulted in the Spartans falling from the rankings.\nRutgers.\nTwenty days later, following a two-week pause and the postponement of three games due to COVID-19 issues within the MSU program, the Spartans finally returned to the Court with a visit to Rutgers. After only being able to practice a few days together, the Spartans fell behind early to Rutgers 15–0. MSU rallied to pull with three at 22–19, but the Knights held a 26–20 lead at the half. MSU fell apart in the second half, managing to score only 17 points while surrendering 41 points by Rutgers as the Spartans were blown out 67–37. No Spartan scored in double figures. Aaron Henry scored seven on three of 10 shooting as the Spartans shot 28.6% from the field and 20% from three. The game marked the first time MSU had lost to Rutgers ever. The loss dropped MSU to 2–5 in conference and 8–5 overall. Gabe Brown did not play in the game as he had recently tested positive for COVID-19. Assistant coach Dane Fife also tested positive and missed the game.\nOhio State.\nWith their chances at making the NCAA tournament dwindling, MSU traveled to face No. 13 Ohio State on January 31. MSU again struggled defensively, allowing the Buckeyes to shoot over 45% from the field. And, once again, MSU struggled offensively, shooting just 20% from three and 32% from the field. Despite a decent first half performance, they still trailed by 12 at the half. Joshua Langford led the Spartans with 14 points while Joey Hauser added 11. MSU was simply overwhelmed by OSU and lost 79–62 further putting at risk their 22-game NCAA tournament streak. The loss left MSU at 8–6 overall and 2–6 in conference play.\nIowa.\nNearing desperation as the Spartans' chances for the NCAA tournament continued to weaken, MSU traveled to face No. 8-ranked Iowa on February 2. MSU jumped out to an early lead, leading by as many as 12 in the first half and hitting their first six three-pointers. Foster Loyer got the start at point guard for the Spartans and Aaron Henry paced the Spartans, scoring 24 points. Iowa, with National Player of the Year candidate Luka Garza, rebounded to take the lead later in the first half. MSU trailed by five at halftime despite playing their best basketball in some time. The Hawkeyes looked to run away with the game in the second half, leading by 12 on several occasions before MSU tied it at 62. MSU again trailed 78–70 with about two minutes left in the game, but the Spartans scored eight of the next nine points to narrow the lead to two with less than 30 seconds remaining. However, Joshua Langford missed a mid-range shot on the next possession and Iowa iced the game with free throws. The 84–78 loss showed that the Spartans had not given up on the season. Tom Izzo was unhappy with officiating as the Hawkeyes shot 35 free throws to MSU's 15. The loss dropped the Spartans to 8–7 overall and 2–7 in Big Ten play, their worst start in conference since 1970.\nNebraska.\nMSU returned home to face Nebraska who was coming off a pause due to COVID-19 on February 6. MSU started well, taking the lead in the first half and building a 12-point lead at the half. The Spartans limited Nebraska to 25% from the field in the first half while MSU shot 44%. Joshua Langford led the Spartans with 18 points while shooting four of six from three. MSU could not put the Cornhuskers away in the second half, never stretching the lead to double figures for more than a few minutes. MSU held on for their first win since January 5, winning 66–56. Aaron Henry added 16 points, but no other Spartan scored in double figures. Gabe Brown returned after missing three games after testing positive for COVID-19. Joey Hauser continued his poor play, fouling out with zero points in 14 minutes of action. The win moved MSU to 9–7 overall and 3–7 in Big Ten play. Thomas Kithier left the game in the first half after not feeling well and was to be tested after the game. Tom Izzo said later that he repeatedly tested negative for COVID-19 in the ensuing days.\nPenn State.\nThree days later, MSU took on Penn State at Breslin Center. The Spartans played well in the first half, limiting Penn State to 32% shooting including only one of 10 three pointers. MSU made three of six threes in the first half while shooting just under 45% and taking an eight-point lead at the half. Penn State shot a bit better in the second half, making 30% of their threes and 37% from the floor, but MSU struggled, shooting less than 40% from the field and making only one of nine three-pointers. As a result, Penn State narrowed the lead and even took the lead with less than four minutes remaining in the game. However, PSU failed to make a basket from the field in the final 4:29 and Joey Hauser and Marcus Bingham hit free throws down the stretch to give MSU the 60–58 lead with 1:14 remaining, PSU missed three three-pointers on their next three possessions as MSU held on for the 60–58 win. The win moved the Spartans to 10–7 and 4–7 on the season. Aaron Henry led the Spartans with 20 points while Malik Hall added 10 points.\nIowa.\nNo. 15 Iowa next visited MSU on February 13. MSU trailed from the outset as Iowa shot over 50% from three, but the Spartans were able to limit Luka Garza to only eight points in the game. However, that was not the recipe for success as the Spartans were blown out 88–58 resulting in the school's worst home loss under Tom Izzo. The loss further lessened the Spartans already unlikely chances of qualifying for the NCAA tournament. Gabe Brown led MSU with 15 points while Aaron Henry added 13. MSU shot 35% from the field and 28% from three in the blowout. The loss moved MSU to 10–8, 4–8 on the season.\nPurdue.\nOn February 16, MSU traveled to face Purdue in West Lafayette. MSU kept the game close throughout, even taking the lead at points in the second half. Aaron Henry led the Spartans with 15 points and Maddy Sissoko played well in the first half, scoring five points in six minutes. Julius Marble added 10 points in 19 minutes. Sissoko did not play in the second half as the Spartans went mostly with Thomas Kithier and Marble. As a result, the Boilermakers were able to pull away and won by 11, 76–65. MSU shot the ball pretty well, making 44% of their field goals including 43% from three. Purdue struggled from three, making only three, but dominated inside as Trevion Williams scored 28 points to lead all scorers while Purdue's other big man, Zach Edey added 10 points in just eight minutes of play. The loss moved MSU to 10–9, 4–9 on the season.\nIndiana.\nOn February 20, MSU traveled to Indiana to face the Hoosiers. MSU trailed early, struggling offensively and defensively as Indiana built a double-digit lead. However, the Spartans countered to pull within four at the half. The Spartans only made two threes in the first half despite shooting 41% from the field. In the second half, MSU's offense came alive as Tom Izzo settled on a lineup consisting of Rocket Watts, Josh Langford, Gabe Brown, and Aaron Henry. With Thomas Kithier and Julius Marble alternating at the center position, the Spartans shot over 56% from the field including five of nine from three. MSU also made 15 of 18 free throws after not getting to the free throw line at all in the first half. Aaron Henry tied a career-high with 27 points while Josh Langford and Gabe Brown each scored 14. MSU took the lead with just over eight minutes remaining and pushed the lead to 12 with less than five minutes remaining. The Spartans held on from there despite missing several free throws with less than two minutes remaining. The 78–71 win moved MSU to 11–9 on the season and 5–9 in conference play.\nIllinois.\nOn February 23, No. 5-ranked Illinois visited the Breslin Center. MSU started the game with the lineup that did the most damage in the Indiana game, Rocket Watts at point guard and Josh Langford, Gabe Brown, and Aaron Henry on the wings. Julius Marble got the start to face Illinois big man Kofi Cockburn, playing only seven minutes, scoring six points, and fouling out of the game. Thomas Kithier (six minutes) also fouled out of the game and Maddy Sissoko (eight minutes) was ejected for a hard foul late in the game. Marcus Bingham (11 minutes) committed four fouls as MSU threw all their big men at Cockburn and limited him to 13 points in the game. After trailing 5–0 early in the game, the Spartans took control of the game and dominated Illinois in the first half, limiting them to only 24% from the field and leading 36–26 at the half. Langford grabbed 10 rebounds in the first half, tying his career-high in a game. MSU stretched the lead to as many as 18 in the second half before the Illini narrowed the lead. Langford grabbed 16 total rebounds while Henry led the Spartans with 20 points. Watts, Langford, Brown, and Henry each played over 30 minutes as Tom Izzo settled into the smaller lineup as the team's best chance to win. MSU was forced to play Joey Hauser at center late in the game, but he had his best game in months, scoring 13 including a clutch three-pointer and making several free throws late in the game. Illinois attempted 34 free throws, but only made 19 as MSU pulled out a 81–72 win. The win, by far the biggest of the season for MSU, moved the Spartans to 12–9 and 6–9 in conference play and put MSU back into the discussion for a possible berth in the NCAA tournament.\nOhio State.\nTwo days later, the Spartans welcomed their second straight top-five opponent as No. 4 Ohio State visited Breslin. Ohio State took the early lead in the first half, shooting 56% from the field while MSU shot just 46%. As a result, Ohio State led by five at the break. Ohio State led by as many as nine in the second half as MSU made only one basket in 14 attempts in a period from the end of the first to the beginning of the second. However, MSU rallied, led by Aaron Henry's 18 points and Gabe Brown's 11 points. For the second straight game, Joey Hauser hit a clutch three-pointer to draw the Spartans within a point. Rocket Watts struggled in the game, shooting one of 10 from the field and playing only 24 minutes. The Spartans went without a point guard down the stretch as Henry ran the point. Up by one, after free throws by Henry, Josh Langford hit a jumper to push the lead to three for the Spartans with 30 seconds remaining. Ohio State moved to within one after free throws by E.J. Liddell. Hauser was fouled with 12 seconds remaining and missed one of two free throws leaving OSU down by two. A good defensive play by Langford gave the ball back to the Spartans, but Langford also missed one of two free throws leaving Ohio State within three with just over a second remaining. MSU held on for the win, 71–67 win, notching a second win against a top-five team in three days. The win moved MSU to 13–9 overall, and 7–9 in conference and put the Spartans squarely back on the bubble and in contention for an at-large berth to the NCAA tournament that seemed completely impossible only a week or two earlier.\nMaryland.\nOn February 28, MSU traveled to face Maryland. The Spartans started slowly, falling behind 11–0. Maryland made six of 10 three-pointers in the first half, but the Spartans narrowed the lead to single digits for most of the half. With MSU trailing by 10 at the half, the Spartans rallied on several different occasions, bringing them within five points on a few occasions. However, Maryland's free throw shooting, making 23 of 24 shots, kept the Spartans from getting any closer. The Terrapins were able to pull away and win by 73–55. MSU, playing its fourth game in eight days, showed fatigue, shooting 33% from the field and 28% from three in the loss. The loss dropped the Spartans to 7–10 in league play and 13–10 overall, but they remained in consideration for an at-large berth to the NCAA tournament.\nIndiana.\nThe Spartans played their fifth game in 10 days as Indiana visited Breslin on March 2. Both teams struggled offensively in the first half, Indiana shot under 28% while the Spartans shot under 37% from the field. As a result, the game was tied at 26 at the half. In the second half, both teams continued to struggle and neither team could manage to take a large lead. MSU made four of 17 three-pointers while limiting Indiana to two three-pointers in the game. Aaron Henry took over late in the game, scoring 12 straight points at one point as MSU pulled away to notch a six-point win, 64–58. Henry finished the game with 22 points, eight rebounds, and five assists. The win moved MSU to 14–10 on the season and 8–10 in conference play. The win also kept the Spartans in the discussion for an at-large berth to the NCAA tournament with only two regular season games remaining. Prior to the game, the Spartans announced that guard Foster Loyer had had shoulder surgery and would miss the remainder of the season.\nMichigan.\nTwo days later, MSU traveled to face rival Michigan on March 4, marking their sixth game in 12 days. MSU kept the game close through most of the first half, but Aaron Henry received his second foul on a controversial \"flagrant one\" call with 2:43 remaining in the half. Tom Izzo sent him to the bench to avoid his third foul and Michigan closed on a 9–2 run to take 39–28 halftime lead. In the second half, the Wolverines blew out the Spartans, leading by as many as 25. MSU only managed six points in the first 14 minutes of the half and lost 69–50. MSU failed to make a three-pointer for the first time since 2013 and shot only 36% from the field while Michigan shot 50%. The win gave Michigan the regular season Big Ten championship. The loss moved MSU to 14–11 and 8–11 in conference play with one game remaining in the regular season and their NCAA tournament hopes still alive.\nMichigan.\nDue to rescheduling caused by COVID-19 issues, the Spartans finished the season at home playing their second straight game against Michigan on March 7, their seventh game in 15 days. The Spartans started the game well, shooting 40% from the field and making two of four three-point attempts. Michigan guard Eli Brooks was forced to leave the game five minutes in after twisting his ankle. Rocket Watts played well, scoring 11 of his game-high 21 points in the first half while Joey Hauser also added nine points in the half. In the second half, MSU took control, leading by as many as 11 and limiting Michigan to 33% shooting. Michigan was able to narrow the lead to two points, but Josh Langford hit a big three with 49 seconds remaining and the Spartans made their free throws down the stretch to pull out the 70–64 win. Aaron Henry scored 18 points, including six points in the last 3:43. Watts, who played in front of his mom for the first time in college, led the Spartans in shooting 50% from the field and adding four assists and four rebounds. The win all but assured MSU of an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament and marked the third top-five ranked team MSU had beaten in the last five games. The win moved MSU to 15–11 and 9–11 in league play, marking the first time the Spartans had finished with a sub-.500 record in league play under Tom Izzo.\nPostseason.\nBig Ten tournament.\nMSU finished in a tie for eighth place in conference play with Maryland. However, due to tiebreaking rules, MSU received the No. 9 seed in the second round of the Big Ten tournament and will face Maryland on March 11.\nMaryland.\nMSU played Maryland on March 11 in the second round of the Big Ten tournament. MSU started well, jumping to an early 12-point lead and looking like they would win easily. But, as in their prior meeting, Maryland took over defensively and led by four at the half. They pushed the lead to as many as 19 in the second half before Malik Hall scored many of his career-high 19 points to make the score more respectable as MSU lost 68–57. Aaron Henry scored 12 runs and corralled nine rebounds in the loss. The loss did prevent MSU from playing on Friday in the tournament, the first time MSU had not played in the quarterfinals in tournament history. The loss was not expected to hurt MSU's chances at receiving an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament.\nNCAA tournament.\nThe Spartans received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, and were categorized as one of the last four teams in the tournament. As a result, they received an 11 seed in the East region and faced UCLA in the First Four.\nUCLA.\nMSU started strong and built a 14-point lead late in the first half and led 44–33 at the half. MSU shot over 56% from the field in the first half, but their defense still allowed the Bruins to shoot 50% from the field in the first half. In the second half, MSU shot just 42% from the field and made only one of seven three-pointers as UCLA was able to close the gap and even take the lead in the half. UCLA shot 60% from the field in the second half, but still trailed by three with over a minute remaining. UCLA rebounded a missed free throw on a poor box-out of the shooter by Aaron Henry. Marcus Bingham then fouled the shooter, Jaime Jacquez Jr. who made the basket and the ensuing free throw to tie the game. Holding the ball for the last shot, Henry missed a jumper and UCLA missed a half-court heave to move the game to overtime. In overtime, MSU unraveled, scoring only one basket and losing 86–80. Henry finished the game with 16 points in his last game as a Spartan. Josh Langford, also in his last game as a Spartan, added 12 points.\nRoster.\nFollowing Xavier Tillman's decision to enter the 2020 NBA draft, Jack Hoiberg was given the team's last remaining scholarship. On September 3, 2020, the school released the official roster showing a new walk-on on the team, Davis Smith, son of former Spartan star Steve Smith.\nSchedule and results.\nDue to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the start of the season was pushed back from the scheduled start of November 10. On September 16, 2020, the NCAA announced that November 25 would be the new start date. Matchups for ACC–Big Ten Challenge were released on October 30. The Champions Classic, which was originally to be held on November 10, was later moved to December 1 and was to be held in Orlando. However, due to disagreements between ESPN, who was staging the event (and others), over health and safety protocols related to COVID-19, the event was canceled. It was hoped that the event could be still held elsewhere. Additionally, the Orlando Invitational tournament, also to be held in Orlando by ESPN, was canceled. It was later reported that the Spartans would play their Champions Classic game at Duke while Kentucky and Kansas would play in Indianapolis due to conflicting COVID-19 protocols by the respective schools.\nOn December 8, one day before they were scheduled to play, Virginia announced it was postponing its ACC–Big Ten Challenge game with the Spartans due to COVID-19 issues at Virginia. On January 12, 2021, it was announced that the game against Iowa on January 13 would be postponed due to at least three positive COVID-19 tests at Michigan State. The next day, the school announced that the game against Indiana on January 17 would also be postponed. On January 18, Tom Izzo announced that the game against Illinois on January 23 would also be postponed due to further positive COVID-19 tests in the MSU program.\nOn January 25, it was announced that the game against Michigan on February 6 would be postponed due to an outbreak at Michigan of a COVID-19 variant.\nThe Iowa game was rescheduled for February 2. As a result, and due to COVID-19 issues at Nebraska, the Nebraska game scheduled for February 3 was moved to February 6 to replace the postposed Michigan game. On February 8, it was announced that the Illinois game has been rescheduled for February 23, 2021.\nThe Indiana game was rescheduled to March 2 and the Michigan game to March 4 meaning MSU would finish the season with seven games in 16 days.\n!colspan=9 style=|Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big Ten regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big Ten tournament\n!colspan=9 style=|NCAA tournament\nPlayer statistics.\nSource"

        "text": "The second series of \"Race Across the World\" began airing on 8 March 2020 with five teams setting off from Chapultepec Castle in Mexico City in a race to the most southerly city in the world, Ushuaia in Argentina, covering a distance of 25,000 km in 2 months, passing through 7 checkpoints in Honduras, Panama, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, and Argentina. Each racer was given £1,453 for the whole trip, roughly £26 per day. Filming started in September 2019.\nIn this series, the 5 teams of racers were Dom &amp; Lizzie, Jo &amp; Sam, Jen &amp; Rob, Shuntelle &amp; Michael, and Emon and Jamiul. No one was eliminated this series but two teams decided to quit; Shuntelle &amp; Michael left after losing half their money in leg 2 of the race, while Jo &amp; Sam withdrew after they had run out of money in leg 7. The no-fly rule was abandoned this series due to civil unrest in Ecuador which made land travel through the country unsafe, and all the teams were flown from Colombia to Peru to continue the race. The winners were Emon and Jamiul.\nThe number of episodes increased to nine this series; eight episodes on the race followed by a reunion special.\nResults summary.\nColour key:\nRoute.\nThe checkpoints in the second series are:\nRace summary.\nLeg 1: Mexico City → Copán Ruinas.\nThe first checkpoint was Copán Ruinas in Honduras. Shuntelle &amp; Michael decided to travel to the northern Caribbean coast of the Yucatan Peninsula enroute to Belize. Dom &amp; Lizzie chose to go from Oaxaca City to Guatemala via the Pacific coast route, but visited the infinity pool at Hierve el Agua while waiting for a bus at Oaxaca City. Emon &amp; Jamiul chose the interior route so they could see the Mayan ruins at Palenque. Initially they had intended to go via Tonalá, but found that it would mean a six hour detour, and so changed bus half-way through.\nJo &amp; Sam also initially intended to go to Belize, but a stranger in San Cristóbal de las Casas advised them the ideal route was via Guatemala. This proved fortunate as it allowed them to reach Copán Ruinas first on day 6 of the race, despite stopping along the way to work for money at an organic farm in Antigua Guatemala.\nAt Belize, Shuntelle &amp; Michael and Jen &amp; Rob managed to catch the boat from Placencia to Puerto Cortés in Honduras, but had to take shelter in Honduras after getting caught in Tropical Storm Karen on their way to Copán Ruinas. Emon &amp; Jamiul missed the boat despite taking an expensive taxi ride to Placencia and had to wait until the following day for a boat. They finished last in this leg.\nLeg 2: Copán Ruinas → Panama City.\nJo &amp; Sam chose to go through El Salvador to get to Nicaragua. Although they were the first team to leave, they worked for a day at a hostel in El Cuco, El Salvador collecting turtle eggs to earn some money, which lost them their lead. In an effort to get to the front, Dom &amp; Lizzie decided to travel non-stop in Honduras from Santa Rosa de Copán on back-to-back buses, hopping from town to town, and became the first team to cross into Nicaragua. After stopping in Limón, Costa Rica to work in a farm with the Bribri tribe, they arrived at the checkpoint in Panama City first on Day 14 of the race.\nAs they were a long way behind, Emon &amp; Jamiul took the faster CA1 route via San Salvador to make up time. They also took an expensive direct bus ride from Managua to David, Panama. They overtook Jen &amp; Rob, who took a break in León and the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve and were the last team to arrive at Panama City.\nIn Honduras, after buying food at a stop, Michael found that he had lost his money belt containing £1,155, more than half of the team's remaining funds. Even though they tried to earn some money at the Ballena National Marine Park, Shuntelle &amp; Michael decided to quit the race at the second checkpoint as they felt they could no longer compete with too little money left.\nLeg 3: Panama City → Villavieja.\nThe original destination was to be Quito, Ecuador; however, due to civil unrest, the checkpoint was moved to the Bethel Hotel near Villavieja in the Tatacoa Desert of Colombia. The teams were instructed to avoid the Darién Gap, so they travelled by sea over the northern coast of Panama from Puerto Tupile in Cartí to the Colombian town Capurganá.\nAlthough Dom &amp; Lizzie were the first to leave, they had to stay overnight at Playón Chico and then missed the boat from Capurganá to Necoclí. As a result, all the teams met up at the port, just as two teams were queuing to leave for Necoclí. Jen &amp; Rob managed to catch the next boat 5 minutes later, but Emon &amp; Jamiul wrongly believed they had missed their chance, and decided to stay for a day at Capurganá and worked at a local scuba-diving school. Fortuitously, they were advised by the locals to travel on an obscure route from Medellín to Neiva. This choice helped them leap to the front, and they reached the checkpoint in the Tatacoa Desert near Villavieja first.\nIn order to save on accommodation cost, Jen &amp; Rob took two night buses to reach Bogotá via Medellín. After a night in Bogotá, they took a bus heading to Neiva, but arranged a drop-off near Villavieja to avoid a detour. They then trekked to a river, crossing it by boat before reaching the checkpoint to finish second.\nJo &amp; Sam decided to take a break at Medellín to relieve the stress of travelling. They then travelled via Cali where they tried to work in a dance club La Matraca, although Sam failed to complete his work as he found it stressful. \nDom &amp; Lizzie took a detour to work at Guatapé before going to Bogotá. However, this choice cost them the lead, and they finished behind all the other teams.\nLeg 4: Villavieja → Puno.\nDue to the continuing civil unrest in Ecuador, the teams were not allowed to travel to Peru by land or sea and were flown to the nearest airport in Jaén in Peru to continue the race. The teams left the Jaén airport in the same order that they arrived in at the checkpoint in the Tatacoa Desert. All the teams went down to the coast to travel to Peru's capital Lima. Emon &amp; Jamiul went to Trujillo and they worked with fishermen for bed and board at Huanchaco, while Jen &amp; Rob went via Chiclayo to a sanctuary for the spectacled bear. They again employed the strategy of travelling on a night bus to save on accommodation.\nBoth Jo &amp; Sam and Dom &amp; Lizzie also went to Lima via Chiclayo. Jo &amp; Sam chose a more expensive bus ride for greater comfort, as well as taking a break to go sandboarding in the desert oasis of Huacachina near Ica before travelling to their destination in Puno, which depleted their funds. However, as they did not stop to work along the way, Jo &amp; Sam reached the checkpoint first, a hotel on an island connected to the shore of Lake Titicaca at Puno.\nBoth Emon &amp; Jamiul and Dom &amp; Lizzie went from Lima to Puno via a steeper route through Cusco. Although ahead of the others, Emon &amp; Jamiul took a detour to see the Rainbow Mountain. Jen &amp; Rob travelled in a slower but more gradual climb to Puno via Arequipa. They reached Puno at the same time as Emon &amp; Jamiul, and beat them to the second spot at the checkpoint on Day 27.\nDom &amp; Lizzie spent a night working at a bar in Cusco. It delayed their journey to Puno, and they finished last for the second time.\nLeg 5: Puno → Cafayate.\nAll three teams apart from Dom &amp; Lizzie went through Bolivia to reach their destination in this leg, which was at a vineyard outside of Cafayate in Argentina. The three teams travelled via La Paz but needed to pass through Bolivia within three days due to a pending election which would close the border.\nEmon &amp; Jamiul visited Valle de la Luna near La Paz and worked at the salt flat of Salinas Grandes to earn some extra money, but still managed to reach the checkpoint Grace Cafayate first on Day 33.\nJo &amp; Sam visited the salt flat of Salar de Uyuni before taking a train from Uyuni to the border town of Villazón to cross into Argentina, where they worked for bed and board in Quebrada de Humahuaca before travelling to Cafayate.\nDom &amp; Lizzie chose to go via Chile as the high altitude was making Dom feeling unwell. Dom suffered a seizure while trying to leave Puno, and was forced to stay an extra day back at the checkpoint hotel, before he and Lizzie left 35 hours after the leaders. In order to catch up, they travelled on back-to-back buses, but were trapped at San Pedro de Atacama by a lack of connecting routes, so were forced to take a break in the Atacama Desert. However, civil unrest broke out in Chile and they had to be evacuated to Argentina by car. They were again the last team to arrive at the checkpoint.\nLeg 6: Cafayate → Ilha Grande.\nThe racers embarked on the longest leg of the race so far, travelling 3,600 km east to Ilha Grande in Brazil. The long journey across more expensive countries depleted the funds for all the teams.\n3 teams concluded that they had to travel via Salta to catch a bus to the border. Both Emon &amp; Jamiul and Jen &amp; Rob chose a shorter route via Paraguay. Emon &amp; Jamiul stopped at Asunción to work in a retirement home. Jen &amp; Rob went to see the Iguazu Falls, and they also took a longer detour for a break to attend the Oktoberfest at Blumenau, which delayed their journey further. They finished second to Emon &amp; Jamiul on Day 40 of the race.\nBoth Jo &amp; Sam and Dom &amp; Lizzie went on a longer route from Argentina to Brazil before travelling up along the Atlantic coast. Although Dom &amp; Lizzie were the last to leave, at the Cafayete bus station, they were informed by a local that there was a direct bus route to Corrientes. There they caught up with Jo &amp; Sam, who had been forced to stay in Salta overnight. Both teams decided to share a mini-van ride to the border with Brazil to avoid further delay.\nJo &amp; Sam went to Praia do Rosa where they worked for bed and board, as well as a chance for Sam to learn how to surf. Both the last two teams arrived at the checkpoint on the island at the same time, with Dom &amp; Lizzie just pipping Jo &amp; Sam to the third spot.\nLeg 7: Ilha Grande → Mendoza.\nThe teams travelled back to Argentina to the penultimate leg of the race. Apart from Jen &amp; Rob, all teams faced financial restrictions in continuing with the race. Jen &amp; Rob, despite missing their boat and bus and working in a hostel in Porto Alegre, travelled the quickest and reached the destination in Mendoza, Argentina first on Day 47.\nEmon &amp; Jamiul chose a longer route through Uruguay as they needed to earn money. They cleaned yachts in Punta del Este, and then worked at a barber shop in Buenos Aires. Dom &amp; Lizzie also had to find ways to save on money, and decided to hitch-hike from the border of Argentina to Posadas, where they worked cleaning boats, before travelling to Mendoza.\nJo &amp; Sam no longer had enough money to finish the leg, so were forced to travel in the opposite direction for work in Rio de Janeiro. They also worked on the bus in Argentina to pay for half their fare to go to Córdoba, Argentina, where they worked on a cattle ranch. With their funds virtually gone, they quit the race at the ranch.\nLeg 8: Mendoza → Ushuaia.\nJen &amp; Rob went to Neuquén before deciding to take the mountain route to Bariloche to work. However, travelling to the mountain instead of the faster coastal route delayed their journey. As Emon &amp; Jamiul were running low on money, they decided to work in Mendoza while waiting for a bus to Bahía Blanca. They also worked on a fishing boat in Puerto San Julián. They secured a free ride with a fisherman to Río Gallegos.\nDom &amp; Lizzie also went to Neuquén for work in an almond plantation nearby. They spent most of their money going to Río Gallegos and were the first to arrive there. However, there was no connecting bus to Río Grande until the following day, which allowed all the teams to meet up, and they travelled on the same bus to Río Grande. Dom &amp; Lizzie did not have enough money to pay for a taxi to Ushuaia, so had to hitch-hike all the way and were the last to arrive. Both Jen &amp; Rob and Emon &amp; Jamiul took taxis. Although Emon &amp; Jamiul did not have enough money to pay for all the fare, they negotiated with the driver to pay for the rest of the fare with an mp3 player. Both teams reached Ushuaia around the same time, and in a foot race, first to Arakur Ushuaia hotel and then the final checkpoint at the summit of Cerro Alarkén, Emon &amp; Jamiul beat Jen &amp; Rob to win the race by 20 seconds.\nReception.\nIn the second series, Joel Golby of \"The Guardian\" judged it \"an astounding piece of TV\" that \"captures all the vibrant highs and exhausted lows of travel in all of their raw glory\", and one that made him \"genuinely caring how this one ends and the impact it will have on the lives of those who lived it\". Anita Singh of \"The Telegraph\" thought \"the casting is one of the strengths of the series\" and she \"can't help but warm to these wacky racers\". However, Chris Moss of the same paper was more negative; he found that the obstacles the contestants faced were \"largely fictive\" and the tension \"fabricated\", and thought the show used the \"old idiot abroad trope\", and the viewers were \"asked not to marvel at faraway places but to engage with the participants\". Equally negative was Barry Didcock of \"The Herald\" who considered the show's premise of travelling without flying \"a frivolous exercise\" and of questionable taste as the budget of racers would exceed that of a refugee at the Mexico-Guatemala border. In contrast, Shaun Kitchener wrote in \"Metro\" that the show \"is the heartfelt light we all need in these dark times\" as it was aired during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the \"masterful combination of escapism (the scenery!), warmth (the contestants!), drama (the conflict!) and adrenaline (the actual race!), \"Race Across the World\" is a merciful piece of TV to keep us briefly distracted over the next few weeks\".\nRatings.\nThe first episode had an overnight rating of 1.9 million. The penultimate episode showing the final leg of the race was watched by an overnight audience of 3.3 million."

        "text": "Schism.\nIn 1964, after three years of existence, the 29-team conference ECAC Hockey was split in two. This was done partly due to its ponderous size but also because many of the programs in the conference were competing with differing levels of investment. The conference was divided between teams that, in essence, had indoor, artificial-ice arenas and those that didn't. A special provision was made for a few programs but by and large the 14 teams that were placed in ECAC 2 either couldn't or wouldn't fund their programs to a level where they could compete with the upper-echelon programs. The split resulted in the first official delineation of divisions in college ice hockey.\nAt the start there was no NCAA-sponsored tournament. Between the two extant conferences (ECAC 2 and MIAC) only ECAC 2 played a conference tournament, making the ECAC champion a de facto College Division champion (the MIAC would not hold a conference tournament until 1986).\n \nSecond Schism.\nLess than a decade after splitting from ECAC Hockey, ECAC 2 had swollen to more than 30 teams and a further, lower division was made (ECAC 3). ECAC 3 began its conference tournament immediately, however, as they were lower-tier than their parent conference, the ECAC 2 champion was still the de facto College Division champion.\nIn 1973 the NCAA reclassified its sporting divisions numerically. The first official Division II season was 1973–74 yet no second-tier national championship was held until 1978.\n \nTournament Play Begins.\nThe NCAA began holding a lower-tier national tournament in 1978. While most of the teams that played as Division II ice hockey programs actually belonged to schools who were classified as Division III, due to the relatively small number of programs the NCAA did not require the teams to be D-II.\nThe NAIA had been holding an ice hockey tournament since 1968 which was used mostly by western schools. With the advent of the NCAA tournament many western programs began to gravitate back to the NCAA and eventually caused the discontinuation of the NAIA Championship.\nIn 1983 the NCAA created a championship for the Division III level and began requiring that teams participate only in the championships at their level. Due to the low numbers of teams at the Division II level, the D-II tournament survived for only one more season before being discontinued.\n \nTournament Returns.\nThe NCAA agreed to restart the NCAA tournament due to increased interest from Division II programs. With no D-II conferences, the selection committee was left with only the overall records of teams to use when deciding the participants. Bemidji State participated in the first 6 championships, winning 4, but by 1998 most of the teams at the Division II level had left to join the top division, leaving the second tier with just a handful of programs and the tournament was, once again, discontinued.\n \nNortheast 10.\nAfter the NCAA Division II tournament was discontinued in 1999, the few remaining D-II programs were barred from participating in conference tournaments in order for those conferences to retain automatic qualifiers. As a result, the eastern teams began holding a separate cross-conference tournament. This arrangement continued until the teams formally created the ice hockey division of the Northeast 10 in 2009. Because there were no Division II teams outside the conference there was no need for the NCAA to resurrect the National Championship leaving the tournament champion as the de facto Division II champion.\n "

        "text": "The 1985 World Championship of Cricket Final was a One Day International (ODI) match played on 10 March 1985 between India and Pakistan at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Melbourne. Popularly known as \"World Championship of Cricket\", this ODI tournament was held from 17 February to 10 March 1985 in Australia and it marked the culmination of the only World Championship of Cricket with India defeating Pakistan by 8 wickets.\nRoad to the Final.\nIndia reached the final by defeating New Zealand by seven wickets.\nAfter the group stages, the expected outcome was that the 1983 Cricket World Cup finalists India and West Indies would meet again in the final of the World Championship. India held up their end of the bargain by beating New Zealand in the first semi final, however Pakistan produced the one major upset of the tournament to beat West Indies by seven wickets.\nDetails.\nHeading into the match, Pakistan had to play Azeem Hafeez instead of Wasim Akram, from their semi-final victory over West Indies while India made one change with Chetan Sharma replacing Roger Binny from their victory over New Zealand. Pakistan skipper Javed Miandad won the toss and elected to bat. Kapil Dev had Pakistan reeling at 29/3 as he dismissed Mudassar Nazar, Mohsin Khan and Qasim Umar. Soon Rameez Raja was dismissed by Sharma cheaply, but Captain Javed Miandad and Imran Khan steadied Pakistan with 68 runs partnership after both had been controversially given not out by umpire Raymond Isherwood, having edged deliveries to the wicketkeeper. Ironically for India, Imran was yet to open his account. Finally the partnership was broken as Imran was run out for 35. Later Saleem Malik and Javed Miandad, both got dismissed by L Sivaramakrishnan with the same score reading 131.\nAt one stage, Pakistan were 145/9 in 42 overs, but Wasim Raja, the last official batsman for Pakistan remained unbeaten on 21 as he pushed the score with the help of tailender Azeem Hafeez. At the end of the stipulated 50 overs, Pakistan made only 176 for 9, a below par score in a final. For India, Kapil Dev claimed three wickets, While Sharma, Madan Lal and Mohinder Amarnath had economical spell of under 3 runs per over. 19-year-old leg spinner Laxman Sivaramakrishnan had been a revelation during the tournament and produced another superb spell in the final claiming 3 wickets. It was the first time, in the tournament, that India had failed to bowl out the opposition. India bagged 49 out of a maximum possible 50 wickets in the tournament.\nIndian openers Ravi Shastri and Krishnamachari Srikkanth, each had wonderful tournament and chasing the target of 177 to win, their century opening stand did most of the work for their strong batting line-up. Finally Srikkanth was dismissed for 67 by Imran. Azharuddin had a 39 runs partnership with Shastri before being dismissed for 25. Ravi Shastri and Vengsarkar remained unbeaten on 63 and 18 respectively as Indian chased down 177 in 47.1 overs. None of the Pakistan bowlers threatened Indian batsmen, even though Imran Khan, Azeem Hafeez, Tahir Naqqash and Mudassar Nazar had economical spells. For their consistency, at the end of the match, Srikkanth won the Player of the Match award, while Shastri was named the player of the tournament, or as it was known, the Champion of Champions. He was awarded his prize of an Audi 100 motor car, valued at A$35,000 and immediately drove it around the MCG with his entire team sitting either in or on the car The attendance of 35,296 in the match was the highest in Australia at a match in which the home side was not involved\nScorecard.\nFall of wickets: 1-17 (Mohsin Khan), 2-29 (Mudassar Nazar), 3-29 (Qasim Umar), 4-33 (Ramiz Raja), 5-101 (Imran Khan), 6-131 (Saleem Malik), 7-131 (Javed Miandad), 8-142 (Tahir Naqqash), 9-145 (Anil Dalpat)\nFall of wickets: 1-103 (Kris Srikkanth), 2-142 (Mohammad Azharuddin)"

The opportunities and opponents for the Tigers were also expanding, however, college ice hockey was still encountering the same problem it always had; lack of available ice.\nPrinceton spent a week in Concord, New Hampshire at the St. Paul's School facility which they were able to use to prepare for the start of their season. When they hit the ice in January they played at the Pavilion rink in Cambridge because the Boston Arena had been partially destroyed in a fire and was being rebuilt. The rink was so small that teams were forced to play with 6 players aside for the entire contest. Though they played well the Tigers fell 4–5. The following night Princeton was dominated by Toronto and, despite allowing 11 goals, Maxwell was noted as having played particularly well in the game.\nPoor weather caused delays in the construction of the Philadelphia Ice Palace which caused several of the team's games to be rescheduled. They were able to play a game at New Rochelle, losing to the home team 2–4, but playing better with the normal 7 players. The Tigers returned to the Pavilion at the end of the month but several weeks of idleness due to the weather left the team at a disadvantage to Harvard who handed Princeton their fourth loss.\nPrinceton played the first intercollegiate game at the Philadelphia Ice Palace against Yale, losing 0–4. a few days later the Tigers managed to earn their first win of the season by downing the restarted Pennsylvania squad. After earning a second win over Quaker City Hockey Club the Tigers faced Yale in a rematch. In the second game against the Elis, the teams agreed to play the entire contest at 6-on-6 with three 15-minute periods. This may be the first college game purposefully played under modern conditions.\nPrinceton played well against Dartmouth, keeping up with their opponents until the fourth overtime period, a new program record. Four nights later, however, the Tigers were routed by Harvard again as the Crimson claimed the Championship.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

It was the first staging of the World Women's Snooker Championship since 2019, following an 18-month suspension of the World Women's Snooker Tour between March 2020 and August 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to receiving the newly renamed Mandy Fisher Trophy, the winner of the tournament earned a place on the professional World Snooker Tour from the start of the 2022–23 snooker season.\nReanne Evans was the defending champion, having defeated Nutcharut Wongharuthai 6–3 in the 2019 final to win her 12th women's world title. However, Evans lost 1–4 to Wendy Jans in the quarter-finals, the first time in her career that she had not reached the semi-finals of the tournament. Three-time champion Ng On-yee came from 0–3 behind in her quarter-final against Wongharuthai to force a deciding frame, but Wongharuthai won the match 4–3 on the final black. The quarter-final losses by Evans and Ng meant that no former champion reached the semi-finals.\nWongharuthai won the tournament, defeating Wendy Jans 6–5 in the final. She became the first Thai player to win the women's world title, the 13th different winner of the tournament since its inception in 1976, the first new champion since 2015, and the only player besides Evans or Ng to win the title in 19 years. She gained a two-year professional tour card, allowing her to join the World Snooker Tour from the beginning of the following season. Upon her return to Thailand, she was granted an audience with the country's prime minister Prayut Chan o-cha, and its Minister for Tourism and Sports Pipat Ratchakitprakarn.\nPrize fund.\nThe breakdown of prize money for the event is shown below:\nFinal summary.\nThe final, contested as the best of 11 frames between Thai player Nutcharut Wongharuthai and Belgian player Wendy Jans, lasted five hours and 40 minutes. Although Wongharuthai took an initial 2–1 lead, Jans then won four of the next five frames to lead 5–3, also contributing the final's highest break of 84 in the fourth frame. Wongharuthai later stated: \"When I was 5–3 behind I thought that I had lost, and I really just started to play for fun because I was too tense. Luckily, it worked.\" Wongharuthai won the next two frames to level the scores at 5–5. Requiring a snooker in the decider with only the colours remaining, Jans potted the yellow and green before obtaining four foul points when Wongharuthai failed to escape from a snooker on the brown. Jans then potted the brown, blue, and pink, but missed a long black into the yellow pocket, leaving it over the middle. Wongharuthai potted the black to clinch the title."

The Hoosiers finished the season 12–15, 7–12 in Big Ten play to finish in a tie for the 10th place. As the No. 10 seed in the Big Ten tournament, they lost in the first round to Rutgers.\nOn March 15, 2021, the school fired Miller after four years and began its search for the next men's head basketball coach. Two weeks later, the school named former Indiana player and New York Knicks assistant Mike Woodson as the new head coach.\nPrevious season.\nThe Hoosiers started off another strong campaign by going 11–1 before dropping back-to-back games in late December 2019 and early January 2020. During the bulk of the conference season, IU was able to win most of their home games (7–3), while stealing a few road games (2–8) to end their final season with an overall record of 20–12 and a conference record of 9–11. Indiana entered the Big Ten tournament as the 11-seed where they faced the 14-seeded Nebraska Cornhuskers. The first round matchup ended in an 89–64 IU victory, staging a second round matchup with 6-seed Penn State. However, on the morning of March 12, 2020, the Big Ten Conference announced that it would be cancelling the remaining tournament games due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following suit, that afternoon, the NCAA announced that it was cancelling all winter and spring championships. This announcement officially, and abruptly, ended the Hoosiers' season, where they were expected to make the NCAA tournament for the first time in 4 years.\nOffseason.\nRecruiting class.\nMiller continued to implement his \"inside-out\" approach to recruiting by adding two more highly ranked recruits from Indiana: Trey Galloway and Anthony Leal, who was named 2020 Indiana Mr. Basketball on April 10, 2020. With Leal earning this honor, he made three straight Indiana Mr. Basketball's to attend IU, the first time to happen in the storied history of the program.

        "title": "Fort Shaw Indian School Girls Basketball Team",
        "text": "The Fort Shaw Indian School Girls Basketball Team was made up of seven Native American students from various tribes who attended the Fort Shaw Indian Boarding School in Fort Shaw, Montana, United States. They became World Champions at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition (more commonly known as the St. Louis World Fair) by defeating basketball teams from across the United States and world.\nHistory of Indian Boarding schools.\nAmerican Indian Boarding schools, otherwise known as Indian Residential Schools, were established in the 19th and 20th centuries with the primary purpose of assimilating Native American children and teenagers into mainstream Euro-American culture. Richard Henry Pratt opened the first Indian Boarding school, the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, basing the curriculum and structure on his years of military background. Pratt's goal was to \"kill the Indian and save the man.\" The strict assimilation policies at the schools often prevented students from visiting their families and returning to familiar language and customs. Upon arrival, students were forced to give up any \"tribal\" clothing and were given new Christian names. The Fort Shaw Indian School was modeled after Pratt's Carlisle school.\nSport at Indian boarding schools.\nAthletics were an important aspect of the boarding schools across the country and were fundamental for assimilation. Football was popular at the Carlisle Industrial school and they became well known for their football and other athletic programs. Most historians agree that the primary purpose of athletic teams at Indian boarding schools was to promote physical health. Diseases and poor health were constant points of concern for the Indian boarding schools, a fact that became well known after the 1928 Meriam Report exposed the high number of deaths among students. Medical research at the time cited that physical activity in general and outdoor activity more specifically were the best practices to combat disease. Also common in American society at the time, sport was assumed to help build moral character by instilling hard-work, discipline, and sportsmanship, especially in boys. Pratt also believed that athletic teams of Indians would show the white community that Native Americans were more than \"savages\" and capable of being good sportsmen with whites in their own games.\nHistory of Fort Shaw Indian School.\nAbandoned by the United States Army on 1 July 1891, Fort Shaw (located in north central Montana) was originally built between Fort Benton and Helena to protect the settlers from Indian attacks. In 1892, nearly 5,000 acres of the fort and its surrounding land were re-purposed as the Fort Shaw Government Industrial Indian Boarding School by the Department of the Interior after a government school in northeastern Montana burned down. It opened its doors on December 27 of that year with 52 students. By the turn of the century the school had over 300 students, ages five to eighteen, with thirty employees. Typically, academic classes were taught in the morning with more vocational courses, like cooking and sewing, in the afternoons. The Blackfoot tribe saw the greatest representation at the Fort Shaw school.\nThe school lost government funding on April 17, 1910 as a result of a growing support for the abolishment of non-reservation schools in Congress and growing integration of public schools. The site was ceded to the U.S. government.\nBeginnings of the Fort Shaw Indian School Girls Basketball Team.\nThe Fort Shaw school had boys' basketball, football, and track teams that competed against regional high schools and colleges from the schools opening. Originally Fort Shaw girls were only offered a \"physical culture class,\" but by 1897 basketball was introduced to the Fort Shaw girls by student and \"Indian Assistant\" Josephine Langley. Langley was introduced to the sport after a semester at the Carlisle Boarding School and was supported by superintendent Frederick Campbell in establishing basketball as an indoor sport for students to play during the winter. The dance hall of the Fort Shaw military establishment was converted into a court and in 1902, a girls team was started with a team of seven girls who played together for the next three years. The reception to the girls' basketball team was just as enthusiastic as for the boys because in most Native American cultures, girls were encouraged to play sports with the same intensity as the boys. It was also the only sport girls were allowed to participate in.\nWhen the team was started, none of the girls had played basketball before, although they had played shinney and double ball (two related Indian field games). Girls at the Fort Shaw school played by the boys' rules: full-court, 20-minute halves with no breaks rules. The games were generally low-scoring, partially due to the time length of the game, running the clock while retrieving the ball and conducting center court tip-offs after every basket. The players' cumbersome uniforms and the slightly bigger ball than the one used today also contributed to the low scores.\nCoaches and assistants.\nFrederick C. Campbell became the school's second superintendent in 1898. For years he doubled as superintendent and coach when the team started in 1902. He resigned from the school in 1908. As superintendent, he expanded the school's athletic program because he believed it would help the student's self-esteem as it had helped him while playing baseball at the University of Kansas. He was the one to introduce competitive basketball to Fort Shaw as well as in surrounding schools so the team would have competition.\nSadie Malley became the assistant coach in the team's second season. She had been teaching at the school since 1899. She had been Josephine Langely's substitute in coaching the team before they became competitive and Campbell took over. It was under her insistence that the team not play by the \"girls' rules\" (half-court).\nLizzie Wirth, the sister of player Nettie Wirth, joined the team during their second season to serve as a chaperone and choreographed exercises and drills meant to prepare the girls for programs they performed at the 1904 fair.\nFern Evans was the music teacher at Fort Shaw who organized the music program that they performed at the fair to fund their travel and games.\nLillie B. Crawford was tasked with training the team in recitation performances also for funding their games and travels.\nThe Road to World Champions.\n1902–03 Season.\nThe school's season record was 9 wins and 2 losses. It was a year of growing recognition for the team as well as the sport in general.\n1903–04 Season.\nFor their second season, the team was unable to defend their title as unofficial state champions. Possible reasons include trouble scheduling games or reluctance from other teams to play them. Campbell instead schedules exhibition games around the state. At these games, the athletes performed mandolin concerts, literary recitations, and calisthenics in order to pay for food and lodging. They eventually traveled outside the state to North Dakota and Minnesota before heading to St. Louis for the fair. As the superintendent, Campbell had been asked by the fair to send students to the school. He recommended the basketball team but ultimately left the choice to participate up to the players.\n1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition.\nInformally known the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair, the Louisiana Purchase Exposition was held from April 30 to December 1, 1904. The 657 acre fairground provided entertainment through performances, circuses, battle reenactments, a Ferris wheel, and anthropology exhibits.\nAnthropology Days.\nThe Louisiana Purchase Exposition is known for its many Anthropology Days displays of \"exotic peoples\" to, \"reaffirm notions of racial superiority while simultaneously challenging many popular stereotypes.\" Native American people were put on display to demonstrate their possibility for \"progress.\" Anthropology Days architect W. J. McGee designed his events to illustrate the evolution of humans from \"savagery\" to \"barbarism\" to \"civilization.\" The displays were also ways for the imperialist countries who presented them to justify their subjugation of indigenous people worldwide.\nModel Indian School.\nThe Model Indian School, home to 150 students during the fair, was located on \"Indian Hill\" at the fair next to the fair's own reservation where traditional housing was set up and ancient crafts were created in order to compare the students to those on the reservation. The Model Indian School was strategically placed between the \"realistic\" huts of the most \"savage\" human exhibits and the green fields of the modern athletic complex, demonstrating the evolutionary scale in a visual and physical nature.\nThe girls' presence and decorum at the fair helped show fair-goers that Indians were not \"savages.\" Historian Nancy Parezo notes that the Fort Shaw Girls' championship title disproved theories of Anglo-European athletic superiority, something that the anthropologists studying the fair would never have admitted.\nBecoming World Champions.\nThe basketball exhibition ended with a best of three competition between the Fort Shaw seven member team faced off against the Missouri All-Stars, alumnae of Central High in St. Louis. After an entire summer playing exhibition games at the Model Indian School twice a week, the anticipation was high for the games. Fort Shaw won the first game 24-2. The St. Louis team failed to show up for the second game and forfeited. However, the team asked to continue the competition and Fort Shaw agreed. At the end of the second game the score stood 17 to 6, winning the Fort Shaw girls the title as the basketball champions of the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. On August 25 the girls won the silver and gold cup for women's basketball at the fair. Despite being signed up to play only in the women's basketball bracket, the team won in the general competition, something which was conveniently omitted from \"Spalding's Athletic Almanac.\"\nAfter the Fair.\nWith their heads held high from their victory and with their new title, they returned home to Montana. The team continued to play basketball and were, \"Willing to Play Against Any Girls' Team in Existence\" as a Great Falls Tribute headline stated in the June 27th 1904.\nImmediately following the girls' championship success, seven of the school's graduates were promised all-paid-for educations at Vassar College from the Christian Philanthropist Charles H. Madison. His generosity, however, seemed short lived when he instead decided to tour the team in \"vaudeville\" fashion to make money for his work with rescue missions. The team became quickly disillusioned and returned home in December.\nThe team played for one more year after the Exposition, during which they won the Championship of the Pacific Northwest, before the team was disbanded due to the closing of the school."

        "text": "Andrew Jones (born December 9, 1997) is an American professional basketball player who currently plays for BC Orchies in the French Nationale Masculine 1. He played college basketball for the Texas Longhorns of the Big 12 Conference.\nEarly life and high school career.\nJones was born in Midland, Texas, and moved with his family to Irving, Texas, at age seven. When Jones was in second grade, he suffered minor bruises in a car accident near Sweetwater, Texas, that left his sister, Alexis, with a broken wrist and his father, David, paralyzed from his chest down. Due to his father's disability, Jones learned to cook and care for his father. He played basketball for MacArthur High School in Irving, where as a senior he averaged 30 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists per game and led his team to a 22–7 record. Jones played in the McDonald's All-American Game and Jordan Brand Classic. A four-star recruit, he committed to Texas on December 14, 2015, over Arizona, Baylor, Louisville, Oklahoma State, and Texas A&amp;M, among others. He credited his commitment to a strong relationship with coach Shaka Smart.\nCollege career.\nOn February 25, 2017, Jones scored a freshman season-high 18 points in a 77–67 loss to third-ranked Kansas. As a freshman, he started in 23 games and averaged 11.4 points, 3.9 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 1.2 steals per game. At the end of the season, Jones took part in the NBA Draft Combine and team workouts before ultimately withdrawing from the 2017 NBA draft.\nOn December 5, 2017, as a sophomore, Jones scored a season-high 19 points in a 71–67 win over VCU but left with a right wrist injury in the final minutes. In his next two games, he played limited minutes because he felt tired, prompting Texas to send him for tests. On January 10, 2018, it was announced that Jones was diagnosed for leukemia. He was honored by several other schools and received more than $130,000 in donations for his medical expenses from a fundraising website set up by the Texas athletic department. Jones went to the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center for treatment, and after being released in late February, he finished outpatient treatment in August. While recovering, Jones missed the second half of his sophomore season and was granted medical redshirts for both the 2017–18 and 2018–19 seasons. On October 13, 2018, he suffered a fractured toe in practice, shortly after his return to the team. He returned to action on November 6, scoring one point in nine minutes in a 71–59 victory over Eastern Illinois, one of his two appearances in the season.\nJones made his redshirt sophomore season debut on November 5, 2019, scoring a then-career-high 20 points in a 69–45 win over Northern Colorado. He established a new career high on February 19, 2020, after recording 21 points in a 70–56 victory over TCU. On March 2, Jones was named Big 12 Conference Co-Player of the Week after scoring a career-high 22 points twice in wins over West Virginia and Texas Tech. By the end of the season, he was averaging 11.5 points, 2.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game and was named All-Big 12 honorable mention. He reached double figures in scoring 15 times on the season.\nJones chose to return for a sixth season in 2021–22 after the NCAA ruled that the 2020–21 season, heavily disrupted by COVID-19, would not be counted against the athletic eligibility of any basketball player. At the end of that season, he was named as one of two recipients of the Perry Wallace Most Courageous Award, presented by the United States Basketball Writers Association to one or more individuals associated with men's college basketball who have exhibited extraordinary courage on and off the court. Both Jones and his fellow recipient, Justin Hardy of NCAA Division III Washington (MO), averaged double figures in scoring during the season while battling cancer (with Hardy battling stomach cancer).\nProfessional career.\nOn July 20, 2022, Jones signed with SC Rasta Vechta in the German ProA. He signed with BC Orchies in the French Nationale Masculine 1 on January 10, 2024.\nPersonal life.\nJones is a Christian. Jones' older sister, Alexis, plays in the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). A decorated basketball player at MacArthur High School, she played for Duke and Baylor at the collegiate level, before winning a WNBA championship with the Minnesota Lynx. His favorite subject in high school was mathematics, and he said “I like dealing with numbers and money,” adding that it would help him with the business side of basketball."

The Jayhawks, members of the Big 12 Conference, played their home games at Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence, Kansas. They were led by 18th year Hall of Fame head coach Bill Self. The Jayhawks finished the regular season 20–8 overall and 2nd in the Big 12. They were selected to the 2021 NCAA tournament as a 3 seed. They would be eliminated in the second round.\nSeason notes.\nOn November 30, 2020, the Jayhawks were ranked in the AP poll for the 223rd consecutive week, breaking UCLA's record of 222 from 1966 to 1980. They had been ranked in every weekly AP poll since February 3, 2009. The Jayhawks went on an eight-game winning streak after losing their season opener. Following road losses to Oklahoma State, Baylor, and Oklahoma, the Jayhawks lost 3 straight games for the first time since the 2012–13 season and only the third time under Self. The streak is only the 9th losing streak of any length under Self. In total they lost five of seven games, which lead to them unranked being in the AP poll released on February 8, 2021, ending their ranked streak at 231. After going 3–0 in games that week, they would re-enter the rankings at 23 on February 15, 2021. The Jayhawks were swept by Texas, which was only the 2nd time under Self they were swept in the regular season. They finished 12–6 in Big 12 play, which gave them a 2nd-place finish in the conference. It is the 21st consecutive season the Jayhawks finished in the top three of the Big 12. Additionally, each year of the Big 12's 25 years of existence, Kansas has finished in the top five of the conference. They were selected to the NCAA tournament, their NCAA record extending 31st consecutive tournament, as a 3 seed. The Jayhawks would lose in the second round to USC 51–85, their worst defeat in the NCAA Tournament and their 3rd worst defeat overall in program history. The loss was also the Jayhawks lowest points scored in the NCAA Tournament since the shot clock was introduced in the 1985–86 season. The Jayhawks also ended their streak of 15 consecutive seasons with 25 or more wins, additionally, their 21 wins was the team's lowest win total since the 1988-89 season. However, both win totals were due in part to the Jayhawks playing fewer non-conference games than normal due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRoster changes.\nGraduation.\nBelow are players from the previous season who ran out of college eligibility.\nSchedule and results.\nCOVID-19 impact.\nDue to COVID-19, KU's annual Late Night in the Phog, the Jayhawks name for their Midnight Madness event, was done virtually. On October 13, Kansas and Missouri announced their scheduled renewal of their rivalry would be postponed a year and will begin play in 2021. On October 26, the University of Kansas announced that about 1,500 fans would be allowed, about 10% capacity. Despite the announcement saying that 1,500 fans would be allowed, the school has consistently reported attendance numbers of 2,500 for home games.\nIn total, nine games and the Wooden Classic, which the Jayhawks were scheduled to play in, were cancelled, and one game was postponed.\nThe Jayhawks finished the regular season without any known positive COVID-19 tests from players, coaches, or support staff. They would, however, have an unnamed player test positive prior to the semifinals of the Big 12 tournament. When Bill Self announced the positive test, he also confirmed that two other players had tested positive making a total of three positive tests.

There were 12 NPB teams, split evenly between the Central League and Pacific League.\nSeason schedule.\nThe 2020 season was originally scheduled to begin on 20 March, with a break from 21 July to 13 August, for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. On 26 February 2020, the league announced that its remaining spring training games would be held without fans in attendance, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. With health related precautions in place, the media was allowed into some ballparks. Following another league meeting on 9 March, commissioner Atsushi Saito stated that the 2020 season would be postponed until April. Saito also said that the league aimed to retain a full regular season schedule of 143 games. This announcement marked the first time since 2011 that a Nippon Professional Baseball season was delayed.\nOn 18 April, the league announced that it would remain delayed indefinitely through the entirety of May, with the 18-game interleague schedule removed to accommodate a 125-game schedule. The delay of the 2020 Olympics meant that the three-week Olympic break would no longer be needed. Therefore, it was removed from the schedule. Before the league began play, the 2020 season was shortened to 120 games, and scheduled to end on 7 November. As a result of the condensed schedule, it was also announced that the First Stage of the Pacific League Climax Series would not be played, with the top two teams from the regular season competing in a best-of-5 Final Stage which the regular season winner enters with a one-game advantage. The Central League would do away with its Climax Series entirely, with its regular season winner advancing directly to the 2020 Japan Series.\nWith the lifting of states of emergency over major Japanese cities, NPB announced that it would begin its regular season on 19 June behind closed doors. \"Warm-up\" games began 26 May. All twelve NPB teams played on as scheduled on 19 June. On 10 July NPB began allowing a limited number of fans to attend games, with plans to further ease restrictions in the near future. On 19 September, attendance was expanded to a maximum of 20,000 fans per game, or 50% of stadium capacity."

He was named All-Central Iowa Metro League.\nCollege career.\nWilson began his college career at Kirkwood Community College. As a freshman, he averaged 14.1 points, 6.6 rebounds and 1.9 blocks per game and was named a NJCAA Division II Second Team All-American. Following the end of the season, he committed to transfer to South Dakota State after his sophomore season. He averaged 21 points and 8.7 rebounds per game as a sophomore and was named a first team NJCAA All-American, the Iowa Community College Athletic Conference Player of the Year and the DII Player of the Year as he led the Eagles to the NJCAA Division II national championship.\nWilson became an immediate starter at power forward for the Jackrabbits. He was named the Summit League Men's Basketball Player of the Year and Newcomer of the Year as well as First Team All-Summit League recognition in his first season with the team. Wilson missed the Summit League quarterfinal loss to Purdue Fort Wayne with an injury. He averaged 18.7 points and 6.4 rebounds per game on a team that finished 22–10. As a senior, Wilson averaged 16.7 points, 5.4 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game, earning Second Team All-Summit League honors. He opted to return for an additional season of eligibility, granted by the NCAA due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2022, Wilson was named to the First Team All-Summit League, while teammate Baylor Scheierman was named Player of the Year.\nProfessional career.\nIn October 2022, Wilson signed with ALM Evreux Basket in France but never played for the team after failing a physical due to a possible enlarged heart.

        "title": "Random surfing model",
        "text": "The random surfing model is a graph model which describes the probability of a random user visiting a web page. The model attempts to predict the chance that a random internet surfer will arrive at a page by either clicking a link or by accessing the site directly, for example by directly entering the website's URL in the address bar. For this reason, an assumption is made that all users surfing the internet will eventually stop following links in favor of switching to another site completely. The model is similar to a Markov chain, where the chain's states are web pages the user lands on and transitions are equally probable links between these pages.\nDescription.\nA user navigates the internet in two primary ways; the user may access a site directly by entering the site's URL or clicking a bookmark, or the user may use a series of hyperlinks to get to the desired page. The random surfer model assumes that the link which the user selects next is picked at random. The model also assumes that the number of successive links is not infinite – the user will at some point lose interest and leave the current site for a completely new site.\nThe random surfer model is presented as a series of nodes which indicate web pages that can be accessed at random by users. A new node is added to the a graph when a new website is published. The movement about the graphs nodes is modeled by choosing a start node at random, then performing a short and random traversal of the nodes, or random walk. This traversal is analogous to a user accessing a website, then following hyperlink formula_1 number of times, until the user either exits the page or accesses another site completely. Connections to other nodes in this graph are formed when outbound links are placed on the page.\nGraph definitions.\nIn the random surfing model, webgraphs are presented as a sequence of directed graphs formula_2 such that a graph formula_3 has formula_1 vertices and formula_1 edges. The process of defining graphs is parameterized with a probability formula_6, thus we let formula_7.\nNodes of the model arrive one at time, forming formula_8 connections to the existing graph formula_9. In some models, connections represent directed edges, and in others, connections represent undirected edges. Models start with a single node formula_10 and have formula_8 self-loops. formula_12 denotes a vertex added in the formula_13 step, and formula_14 denotes the total number of vertices.\nModel 1. (1-step walk with self-loop).\nAt time formula_1, vertex formula_12 makes formula_8 connections by formula_8 iterations of the following steps:\nFor directed graphs, edges added are directed from formula_12 into the existing graph. Edges are undirected in respective undirected graphs.\nModel 2. (Random walks with coin flips).\nAt time formula_1, vertex formula_12 makes formula_8 connections by formula_8 iterations of the following steps:\nFor directed graphs, edges added are directed from formula_12 into the existing graph. Edges are undirected in respective undirected graphs.\nLimitations.\nThere are some caveats to the standard random surfer model, one of which is that the model ignores the content of the sites which users select – since the model assumes links are selected at random. Because users tend to have a goal in mind when surfing the internet, the content of the linked sites is a determining factor of whether or not the user will click a link.\nApplication.\nThe normalized eigenvector centrality combined with random surfer model's assumption of random jumps created the foundation of Google's PageRank algorithm."

        "text": "The 2020–21 Gallagher Premiership was the 34th season of the top flight English domestic rugby union competition and the third one to be sponsored by Gallagher. The reigning champions entering the season were Exeter Chiefs, who had claimed their second title after defeating Wasps in the 2020 final. Newcastle Falcons had been promoted as champions from the 2019–20 RFU Championship at the first attempt.\nThe competition was broadcast by BT Sport for the eighth successive season and with five games also simulcast free-to-air on Channel 5. Highlights of each weekend's games were shown on Channel 5 for the final time, with extended highlights on BT Sport.\nSummary.\nHarlequins won their second title after defeating Exeter Chiefs in the final at Twickenham after having finished fourth in the regular season table. No team was relegated this season after a moratorium was agreed.\nDue to changes to the global rugby calendar implemented this year and the COVID-19 pandemic prolonging the 2019–20 Premiership Rugby season, this edition featured a later start and later finish and would take place over a reduced timeframe of 32 weeks.\nThe season also featured a two-week break in January due to the suspension of both of the European Professional Club Rugby competitions.\nRule changes.\nNew regulations were introduced this season for games cancelled as a result of the pandemic or otherwise. A brief outline of the new regulations are:\nWhen cancellation is as a result of COVID-19 points will be awarded as follows.\nThere are also changes to the regulations allowing the Testing Oversight Group to cancel matches.\nRegulations for the semi-finals and final will be published later in the year.\nThis season also includes a moratorium on relegation due to the effects of the pandemic.\nThis season is the last under the current regulations before changes are made next season and again before 2024–25.\nTeams.\nTwelve teams compete in the league – the top eleven teams from the previous season and Newcastle Falcons who were promoted from the 2019–20 RFU Championship after a top flight absence of one year. They replaced Saracens who were relegated after twenty five years in the top flight following two large points deductions during the season.\nFixtures.\nFixtures for the season were announced by Premiership Rugby on 29 September 2020 - this was delayed from July due to the previous season being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.\nThe London Double Header no longer features after being discontinued in 2018. \nLeague Season.\nThe league season began on 20 November 2020.\nPlay-offs.\nAs in previous seasons, the top four teams in the Premiership table, following the conclusion of the regular season, contest the play-off semi-finals in a 1st vs 4th and 2nd vs 3rd format, with the higher ranking team having home advantage. The two winners of the semi-finals then meet in the Premiership Final at Twickenham on 26 June 2021.\nLeading scorers.\nNote: Flags indicate national union as has been defined under WR eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-WR nationality.\nMost points.\nSource:\nMost tries.\nSource:"

        "text": "The San Beda Red Lions basketball program represents San Beda University (SBU) in men's basketball as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines) (NCAA). The San Beda Red Lions are the only remaining founding team in the NCAA.\nHistory.\nThen known as San Beda College (SBC), the Mendiola-based school co-founded the NCAA in 1924, winning its first seniors' basketball title in 1927, then three straight titles from 1934 to 1936. Their three-year title run during the 1930s was led by Charles Borck.\nZamora Cup and 1970s back-to-back titles.\nThe Zamora Cup was awarded to the first NCAA team that wins three titles after World War II. San Beda led by Carlos Loyzaga emerged as the frontrunner in 1952, winning two titles by then. Ateneo then won the next two titles. In 1955, San Beda and Ateneo made it to the Finals, in which the Red Lions won and kept permanent possession of the trophy. San Beda finished the 1950s with another title in 1959, this time led by Alberto Reynoso.\nSan Beda would not a win title again until 1977. Coached by Loreto Carbonell and led by Frankie Lim and Chito Loyzaga (Carlos's son), the Red Lions defeated the Ateneo Blue Eagles, with the deciding game being played behind closed doors due to rampant hooliganism at that time. The Red Lions defended their title in 1978, defeating the De La Salle Green Archers. San Beda withdrew from the NCAA in 1984 to focus on intramural events;\nReturn to the NCAA.\nSan Beda returned in 1986 The Red Lions made it to the Finals in 1991, only to be thwarted by Benny Cheng's game winner for the Mapua Cardinals. They made another Finals appearance in 1996, this time against the undefeated four-time defending champions San Sebastian Stags but lost. The Red Lions again made it to the Finals in 1997 but were again defeated by the Stags. During this back-to-back Finals appearance, they were coached by Dong Vergiere.\nSan Beda won't make it to the playoffs again until 2004. On that season, they took the Perpetual Altas to two games in the semifinals before they were eliminated. Nash Racela, who was coaching the Red Lions at this time, was sacked at the middle of the next season and was replaced by Koy Banal.\nDynasty.\nIn the 21st century, the Red Lions have qualified to 14 consecutive Finals, from 2006 to 2019. This was after a successful \"End 28 at 82\" run where they defeated the PCU Dolphins to end their 28-year title drought during the NCAA Season 82. The iconic team coached by Koy Banal the Red Lions were led by Yousif Aljamal, Ogie Menor and Nigerian import Samuel Ekwe. The next year, they matched the 1977–78 team by winning back-to-back titles defeating the Letran Knights. The Red Lions made it three consecutive titles in 2008, beating the JRU Heavy Bombers.\nThe Red Lions were now gunning for a fourth consecutive title, but were stopped by San Sebastian in 2009. The Red Lions won the next two Finals match-ups against the Stags. In the basketball offseason, the Red Lions men's basketball team were involved in a brawl with the San Sebastian women's volleyball team; this led to the NCAA suspending Lim for two years. Lim left the Red Lions and was replaced by Ronnie Magsanoc. With players like Garvo Lanete, Borgie Hermida and American import Sudan Daniel, Magsanoc coached the team to a convincing Finals decider against Letran. Boyet Fernandez replaced Magsanoc in the next season, and won two more titles, in 2013 with a rematch against Letran, and in 2014 against the Arellano Chiefs. This five-year title run matched San Sebastian's domination from 1993 to 1997.\nSeeking an unprecedented sixth straight championship in 2015, the Red Lions, now coached by Jamike Jarin, faced Letran anew in the Finals, the Knights won, and stopped San Beda's title run at five. The team would return in the Finals in 2016, against the Chiefs; bannered by Robert Bolick, Javee Mocon and Finals MVP Arnaud Noah of Cameroon, Jarin clinched his first NCAA title against Arellano. Fernandez returned in 2017, and won two consecutive titles against the Lyceum Pirates, being reinforced by the Cameroonian Donald Tankoua.\nIn their 21st Finals appearance, the 2020 Red Lions faced the last team that defeated them in the Finals in Letran. The Knights won in the Finals in three games. Due to the COVID pandemic, the NCAA did not hold the basketball events in the 2020 season, and played the 2021 tournament in early 2022. San Beda were upended by the Mapua Cardinals in the elimination round and entered the playoffs without the twice-to-beat advantage. The Cardinals eliminated the San Beda, snapping their Finals streak at 14 years. Management decided not to renew Fernandez's contract, and hired Yuri Escueta to replace him. Escueta coached the Red Lions to another Final Four appearance, but failed to progress to the Finals, losing out to the Benilde Blazers. On his second campaign, Escueta led the Red Lions to a third seed finish after the eliminations, then upset the Lyceum Pirates in the semifinals. San Beda won the title in three games, defeating the #1 seed Mapua Cardinals.\nCurrent roster.\nNCAA Season 99"

The San Sebastian Stags jointly own the longest championship streak in seniors' basketball, winning five straight titles from 1993 to 1997.\nHistory.\nFirst titles.\nColloquially known as \"Baste\", the school has won 14 NCAA seniors' basketball titles. The Stags joined the NCAA in 1969; they won their first title in 1974 led by David Supnet, Jimmy Otazu and Benjie Cleofas. The Stags next title came in 1985; in 1988, the Stags then became the first team to win both pennants, finishing with a 10–0 record and an automatic title. San Sebastian was led by Eugene Quilban and Paul Alvarez. On the next season, the Stags faced the PHCR Altas in the Finals, averting an upset to win back-to-back titles.\nFive-peat.\nIn 1993, San Sebastian began a 5-year title romp, starting with the efforts of Jesse Bardaje and Ulysses Tanigue, giving coach Turo Valenzona his first NCAA title. The Stags won the title again in 1994, again winning all 10 elimination round games, giving Rodney Santos the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award and Rommel Adducul the Rookie of the Year award. They next became the fifth team to win three consecutive NCAA titles, winning the first nine games of the season, only to lose against eventual Finalist Mapua. The Stags won all two games in the Finals though.\nIn 1996, the Stags were gunning for then unprecedented four consecutive titles. In the school's 50th anniversary, Adducul was named MVP and led the Stags to a Finals sweep against the San Beda Red Lions. The Stags won a record five straight titles in 1997, winning all 13 games for a perfect season. Now coached by Bay Cristobal, the Stags had a Finals rematch with San Beda, whom they defeated easily. Adducul had another MVP year, and was backed by Banjo Calpito, Jasper Ocampo, Tanigue, Brixter Encarnacion and team captain Rommel Daep.\nTurn of the millennium titles.\nTwo years later, the Stags were in the playoffs again, but were upset by eventual champions Letran Knights, who were the #4 seed, in the semifinals. The Stags made it to next season's Finals as #4 seed themselves, only to lose to the Benilde Blazers. San Sebastian broke through in 2001, beating the JRU Heavy Bombers in the Finals. In a Finals rematch with Benilde, the Stags won this time to win the title in 2002. The Stags failed to defend the title in 2003, losing to Letran. The Stags barely missed the playoffs in 2004 due to tiebreakers, but made it to the playoffs in the next year, only to lose to Letran in the semifinals. At this time, the Stags were led by Leo Najorda and Red Vicente, and coached again by Valenzona.\nPinatubo trio.\nThe Stags were not to make the playoffs until 2009; in 2008 coached by Jorge Gallent, they finished joint-2nd with 4 other teams, but a series of tiebreaking playoffs eliminated them from contention. Gallent resigned after the season.\nIn 2009, San Sebastian debuted three players from Pampanga, the so-called \"Pinatubo trio\" from Mount Pinatubo. Calvin Abueva, Ian Sangalang and Ronald Pascual, together with senior Jimbo Aquino and coached by Pampanga native Ato Agustin, the Stags finished joint first in the elimination round, and defeated three-time defending champions San Beda. The Red Lions defeated the Stags in a 2010 Finals rematch, and again in 2011, this time now coached by Topex Robinson. Robinson won the postseason 2011 Philippine Collegiate Championship, defeating UAAP champion Ateneo Blue Eagles in the Finals. The Pinatubo Trio, now coached by Allan Trinidad, lost to Letran in the 2012 semifinals. Coached by a returning Robinson in 2013, the Stags would have a semifinals rematch with Letran where they lost. Robinson coached the Stags to a losing season in 2014, after which he resigned.\nAfter the Pinatubo trio.\nRodney Santos, part of the 1990s champion team, was appointed coach in 2015. Santos was sacked after coaching the rebuilding team to a losing season. Now coached by Egay Macaraya, the Stags made it to semifinals in 2017 led by Michael Calisaan and in 2019 led by RK Ilagan, but were eliminated in the stepladder semifinals by San Beda and Letran respectively. In the return of competition after the COVID-19 pandemic, the Stags ended Season 97 on a losing record, with later results not going their way resulting in their elimination. Now led by Ichie Altamirano, the Stags were eliminated in Season 98 playoffs, with Macaraya being ejected for complaining to the officials. Macaraya was then replaced by John Kallos for the 2023 season."

        "title": "Letran Knights basketball",
        "text": "The Letran Knights basketball is the collegiate men’s basketball program of the Colegio de San Juan de Letran. The Knights have won 20 championships since joining the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). It is the second winningest team in the NCAA, just behind the San Beda Red Lions.\nHistory.\nPre-war: first championship.\nThe Letran basketball team found its humble beginnings in \"Liga Catolica\" until the 1920s. Letran then joined the NCAA in 1928. Letran College withdrew, however, in 1933, after a dispute over a decision of one of its team member during the Letran-Ateneo basketball game. Letran then later rejoined the league in 1936. Two years later, the Knights won their first senior basketball title under coach Jacinto Ciria Cruz and team captain Felicisimo Fajardo by beating San Beda, 42-30.\n1950–1980: after the war.\nThe Knights emerged as the top team in 1950. Dubbed as the Letran Murder Inc., Letran could have won the NCAA title by a sweep, but it was beaten by underdog San Beda in the final game of the tournament. The team was coached by Angel de Leon and led by 1948 Olympian Lauro \"The Fox\" Mumar.\nDuring this period, the Knights made a habit of winning championships around the turn of every decade. In 1960 the team, which were led by Clemente Bargas, Augusto Cepeda, bigman William Jance, and rookies Freddie Webb and Basilio Go, faced the Jose Rizal Heavy Bombers in the championship round at the Araneta Coliseum. They finally clinched the championship, thanks to Basilio Go's game-winning jumper from the free throw area to win the game, 75-73, thus ending a ten-year title drought. The 1960 champion team was coached by Bibiano Ouano, former Ateneo Blue Eagle and member of the 1936 Summer Olympics men's basketball team. Later in 1966, the Knights, coached by Nilo Verona and were led by Larry Albano, Nemie Villegas, Augusto Fermin, and Eddie Reyes, beat the much taller Heavy Bombers for the championship. In the 1970 season, the Knights, led by Molet and Ricky Pineda, Rudy Hines and bigman Dave Regullano, beat the De La Salle Green Archers, for the championship.\nIn 1979, two sides from the Intramuros district of Manila, the oldest part of the city, battled one another in the championship round of the tournament. The so-called 'Battle of Intramuros' saw the Letran Knights and the Mapua Cardinals face off for the championship. Coached by the legendary Nemie Villegas, and led by Most Valuable Player (MVP) Ramon San Juan, shooting forward Angelito \"Itoy\" Esguerra, spitfire Pedrito \"Bong\" Aninon, Timoteo \"Tim\" Coloso, Nonito \"Nonie\" Robles, and team captain Ed Baldomero, the Knights defeated the Leo Isaac-led Cardinals to take home the school's 6th championship.\nIn 1980, hooliganism again marred the league. Fans of the Letran Knights, hoping for a back-to-back winning season, and the fans of the De La Salle Green Archers, got involved in a large brawl inside the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex. The BAP ordered the game to be re-played but the NCAA Policy Board decided to cancel the whole tournament. Letran was suspended from all events because of its participation in the brawl, and got reinstated in 1981.\nEarly 80s: Samboy Lim era and the first three-peat.\nThe Letran Knights started the 1982 season under the tutelage of new coach Larry Albano which featured a very exciting player named Avelino \"Samboy\" Lim, a product of San Beda's high school program. After sweeping the first round, the Knights continued to pile up victories in the second round and was two wins ahead of second-ranked San Sebastian Stags. The Knights were unofficially crowned champions but they still had to play Trinity College in a no-bearing game to officially finish their NCAA campaign. The Knights lost that game 102-89 but it didn't matter as the school's 7th title was still presented to them.\nIn 1983, Samboy Lim and the Knights advanced to the championship round where they will meet Nani Demegillo and the San Sebastian Stags for the title. The championship game was decided on a best-of-3 series and both teams split the first two games but in Game 3 the Knights played inspired basketball thanks to Samboy Lim's heroic deed of choosing to play instead of resting in his hospital bed due to an asthma attack prior to the game, and captured their second straight championship. Romy Ang was named MVP of the season. With San Beda taking a leave of absence in 1984, the NCAA kicked off the season with only five schools participating and the Knights become the first school to finish the season undefeated and champions. Samboy Lim was named MVP of the season.\nLate 80s: second back-to-back.\nIn 1985, hopes for a rare four-peat vanished as the Knights succumbed to the Stags in the Finals as they lost five of its key players, notable of which was Samboy Lim.\nIn 1986, Letran won the 2nd round eliminations to arrange a championship match again with the defending champions San Sebastian, led by \"Mr. Excitement\" Paul Alvarez, for the third time in five years. The Knights were coached by Eddie Reyes and bannered by Fernando \"Dong\" Libed, Arthur Ayson, Cayetano Salazar, Jing Ruiz, Robert Ruiz, and Justino Pinat. Letran won the series in three games.\nIn 1987, the Letran Knights swept the 2nd round eliminations to secure a spot again in the Finals to face their rivals San Sebastian Stags in a best-of-three series. The Stags won Game 1 via Eugene Quilban and Napoleon Hatton's heroics. In Game 2, Letran found an unlikely hero in rookie Erwin Santos to secure the win. Letran finally won the series in three games, 63-62, highlighted by a game-winning fadeaway jumper by Dong Libed at the buzzer, making the whole Letran gallery erupted in jubilation and spilled the court.\nThe 1990s: three more titles.\nIn 1992, Letran won the 2nd round of the eliminations and the right to face the 1st round winners San Sebastian Stags in a best-of-three Finals. Led by season MVP Ronald \"Joy\" Peña, Gilbert Castillo, and Wilmon Yu, the Knights defeated the Stags in three games. A power outage hit the area with 42 seconds left and Letran students and supporters poured onto the court for an early celebration while waiting for the lights to be restored.\nIn 1997, the team, bannered by Willie Miller and then-rookie Kerby Raymundo, went on to the Final Four. They beat Mapua in the first round of the step-ladder, but got eliminated by San Beda in the 2nd round.\nIn 1998, the Knights, led by Kerby Raymundo and season MVP Chris Calaguio, and now coached by Louie Alas, faced the sixth-peat seeking Stags in the Finals. Letran won the series via Nicholas Pacheco's game-winning three point shot to capture their 13th championship. Louie Alas then left the team to coach the Philippines men's national basketball team in the 1999 SEA Games in Brunei.\nDuring the 1999 season, the Letran Knights were mentored by Binky Favis. History was made when the Letran Knights became the first team ranked fourth to beat a number one ranked team, the San Sebastian Stags, in the semi-finals that year. The Letran Knights went to the best-of-three Finals to face the JRC Heavy Bombers, led by Ernani Epondulan and Ariel Capus. Letran won Game 1 via Aldin Ayo's late-game layup. During the 2nd game with only 3 minutes remaining, Letran's John Paul Prior and JRC's John Dale Valena got into a fistfight on the court, causing the crowd from both sides to throw all sorts of debris onto the playing court thus delaying the game, and later triggering a brawl that reached outside the ULTRA stadium. JRC officials then decided to concede the game with Letran leading 83-60, thus gave the championship to the Knights. Kerby Raymundo was named season and Finals MVP.\n2000s: return of Louie Alas.\nFrom the 2000 to 2002 seasons, the Letran Knights struggled as they underwent a rebuilding process. In 2002, former mentor Louie Alas came back as the head coach of the Knights after his stints in Manila Metrostars in the MBA, and the Mobiline Phone Pals in the PBA.\nThe 2003 series culminated with a play-off between the Letran Knights and the hosts, the San Sebastian Stags, who had won the previous two championships. The Knights, led by Ronjay Enrile, were aiming to break Ateneo de Manila University's record of 14 titles. The series reached a deciding third game. In the final minutes, Boyet Bautista, Aaron Aban and Jonathan Piñera ignited an 8–0 run, turning a 56–58 deficit into a 64–58 title-clinching victory. Ronjay Enrile was voted as NCAA Finals MVP.\nEmerging at the end of the elimination round during the 2004 season with a 9–5 standing, the Letran Knights faced, in the Final Four tournament, a Philippine Christian University Dolphins bannered by Jayson Castro, Gabby Espinas, Beau Belga, and Rob Sanz, who had a 10–4 standing and a twice-to-beat advantage. The match was forced to a deciding game, but Aban and Enrile both split their free throws in the 4th quarter and the game went into overtime. The Dolphins went on to win their first NCAA title against the season host, UPHSD Altas.\nIn the 2005 season, the Knights and the defending champions Dolphins faced each other again in the playoffs, this time in the best-of-three Finals series. The Dolphins shocked the Knights as they emerged as winners in Game 1. The Knights, however, won Game 2 to force a deciding game led by John Paul Alcaraz. The deciding game was won by the Knights, with Boyet Bautista winning Finals MVP honors. Louie Alas won his third NCAA title and was awarded Coach of the Year.\nIn the 2006 season, the Knights had a 6-0 start but were beaten by San Beda in the first round finale. The Knights won several more games, but with losses to eventual semifinalists Mapua, PCU, and San Beda in their last three elimination round games, they were forced to face-off with PCU. The Knights lost this game and went on to lose another in the final four, finishing second runner-up. Letran Knight Boyet Bautista won the Most Improved Player award.\nLouie Alas described the 2007 season as a \"rebuilding\" season, with Boyet Bautista and Aaron Aban leaving the team after being drafted into the Philippine Basketball Association. The Philippine Christian University Dolphins were suspended, leaving only 7 teams in the competition. The Letran Knights won their first four games before losing to the hosts, the JRU Heavy Bombers. They went on to defeat the San Beda Red Lions, who until then had been unbeaten, and so finished on top after the first round. The team was beaten by Mapua and San Beda in the second round, but still finished second. They defeated the Heavy Bombers in the semifinals but lost to San Beda Red Lions in the Finals.\nIn 2008 season, Letran won the first six games of the season, including a come-from-behind win against UPHSD, but faltered in the first round finale against San Beda. In the elimination round finale, Letran was on the verge of winning a twice-to-beat advantage but a game went into overtime. In the extra period, Letran was leading by 4 points when San Beda rallied to lead by two. RJ Jazul scored on a driving lay-up with 5 seconds remaining but Borgie Hermida scored a buzzer-beater with a looper from the free-throw line to seal San Beda's third straight semifinal appearance with the twice to beat advantage. After San Beda's win against Letran, four teams, including the Knights, were tied from 2nd to 5th, with only 4 teams advancing to the semifinals. Letran defeated Mapua, 62-52, in the classification round and managed to qualify for the second-seed playoff game against JRU. But JRU defeated Letran and the former clinched the second-seed and twice-to-beat advantage. The two teams meet again in the semi-finals, but still Letran lost.\nIn 2009, the Knights were still led by RJ Jazul and Rey Guevarra, who were on their final year of eligibility. Joining them was the former Letran Squire star, Kevin Alas. On their last elimination game, San Beda had an easy win against Letran, but not before Rey Guevarra was injured after a bad fall in a collision with San Beda's Sudan Daniel. Guevarra would be ruled out for the rest of the season with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Letran garnered a fourth-place finish and allowing themselves to qualify in the Final four where they faced, and still lost, to San Beda.\n2010–2012: rebuilding and end of Louie Alas era.\nIn 2010, the Knights failed to advance to the Final 4 for the second time in the Louie Alas era but 2 weeks after the tournament they started their preparation for Season 87.\nIn 2011 the team was joined by Kevin Racal, JRU transferees Joel Gabriel and Carlo Lituania, and spitfire point guard Mark Cruz and Zyron Cudal from the Letran Squires program. From 5th place the previous year, the Knights cruised to the Final 4 as the #3 seed and faced the #2 seed San Sebastian Stags. They beat the Stags in the first game to force a do-or-die game but eventually lost in the second game. Kevin Alas and Raymond Almazan were named to the Mythical 5 and Almazan also bagged the Defensive Player of the Year award.\nThe 2012 season was a roller coaster ride for the Knights as they start the season sinking down as far as the 6th spot and it didn't stop there as star center Raymond Almazan was missing a lot of games in the first round due to unknown reasons. Almazan vowed to come back in the 2nd round and with him back in the lineup, the Knights became the hottest team in the NCAA as they won 7 of their 9 games just enough to secure the #3 spot to force a Final 4 rematch against San Sebastian. In the first game Kevin Alas made history as he scored 43 points, breaking former CSB Blazers star Sunday Salvacion's previous record of 39 points in 2001, to force a knockout game. In the do-or-die game, the game went down to the wire but Jojo Belorio made sure it will be Letran this time by scoring the game winning free throws to book the last ticket to the Finals. They met San Beda in the finals. They were lost in the first game, but avoided defeat in the second game. In Game 3 they were blown out by the Red Lions. A month later after the tournament, longtime head coach Louie Alas resigned.\n2013–2019: coaching changes and back to championship form.\nIn 2013, Letran hired then-Rain or Shine Elasto Painters assistant coach Caloy Garcia as their new head coach, replacing long-time mentor Louie Alas. Joining the team are UPHSD transferee Franz Dysam and former NCAA Season 87 juniors MVP Rey Nambatac from their juniors program. Letran went again to the finals but still lost to San Beda in three games. Raymond Almazan was named season MVP and Defensive Player of the Year.\nIn 2014, the team added former Letran squire and NCAA Season 88 juniors MVP John Quinto. With the departure of Raymond Almazan to the pros, the Knights struggled to enter the Final Four with a 9-9 record. After the tournament, Caloy Garcia parted ways with the Knights. Letran officials then named former Letran Knights player Aldin Ayo as the new head coach.\nIn 2015, Letran officials named Filipino boxing icon Manny Pacquiao as their new team manager. The Knights finally ended its ten-year title drought as they captured their 17th NCAA men's basketball championship by beating San Beda in three games. Mark Cruz was named NCAA Finals MVP. Just weeks after leading the Knights to a championship, Aldin Ayo left Letran to coach the De La Salle Green Archers in the UAAP citing personal reasons.\nThe following year, Letran officials formally named then-NU Bullpups coach Jeff Napa as the new head coach of the Knights. However they struggled to enter the Final Four for two seasons.\nIn 2018, SMC Sports director Alfrancis Chua was named as the Knights' Special Assistant to the Rector for Sports Development. The Knights also added transferees Fran Yu and Edson Batiller from UE, and Larry Muyang from La Salle. They finally barged into the Final Four, but they were eliminated by Lyceum. John Quinto was named as one of the Mythical Five, while Larry Muyang bags Rookie of the Year award.\nIn 2019, coach Jeff Napa formally part ways with Letran after his three-year contract. A month later, former longtime Lyceum Pirates head coach and then-NorthPort Batang Pier team manager Bonnie Tan formally announced as the new head coach of the Knights. After the elimination rounds, Letran finished third place, thus securing a spot in the Final Four. Letran then eliminated San Sebastian and Lyceum via the step-ladder format and entered the Finals, where they faced the unbeaten and defending champion San Beda and defeat them in three games to capture their 18th NCAA championship. Fran Yu was named NCAA Finals MVP and Most Improved Player. After the team's bonfire celebration, Jeff Napa returned to Letran as a team consultant.\n2020–2022: COVID-19 pandemic and second three-peat.\nThe whole NCAA league suffered a setback when the Philippines was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, thus suspending the 95th season to an indefinite halt. In that year, UST Growling Tigers players Rhenz Abando, Brent Paraiso, and Ira Bataller formally transferred to Letran. When the NCAA men's basketball finally resumed in the second semester of the academic year 2021-22, the Knights finished the elimination round at first place with an unblemished record. Letran then eliminated UPHSD and entered the Finals and faced their Intramuros neighbors the Mapúa Cardinals and defeat them in two games to successfully defend and capture their 19th basketball title. Team captain Jeo Ambohot was named NCAA Finals MVP, NCAA All-Defensive Team, and a Mythical Five member, while Rhenz Abando became the 11th Letran Knight to capture the Season MVP award. Abando also bagged the Rookie of the Year award and was also named in the Mythical Five.\nAfter leading the Knights to the NCAA Season 97 title, Rhenz Abando decided to forego his final playing year to pursue his basketball career as a professional player. Abando then signed with the Anyang KGC of the Korean Basketball League. Even without the presence of their MVP, the Knights, still bannered by team captain Fran Yu, Louie Sangalang, and Brent Paraiso, successfully defended and captured its 20th NCAA basketball championship, and their third consecutive title, by beating the number one seeded Benilde Blazers in three games. King Caralipio was named the Finals MVP and also named in the Mythical Five.\n2023–present: Under new management.\nIn March 2023, Letran has reach an agreement with Bacoor mayor and Letran alumnus Strike Revilla as its main backer of the Knights.\nA month later, multi-titled mentor Bonnie Tan stepped down as head coach of the Knights to focus on his duties as the main tactician of the NorthPort Batang Pier in the PBA.

The JRU Heavy Bombers are the varsity teams with the longest continuous membership in the NCAA, having been a member since 1927 without interruption, and have the longest championship drought.\nHistory.\nPrior to the Commission on Higher Education granting it university status in 2000, the school was known as José Rizal College (JRC).\nJRC won the 1963 and 1964 NCAA titles via the exploits of Rene Canent and Egay Gomez; the former would later be the first president of the Philippine Basketball Association Players Association. The Bombers had another back-to-back title romp in 1967 and 1968 led by 1967 Most Valuable Player Rhoel Deles, Carlos Villamayor and Sixto Agbay. \nTheir last title was in 1972, when they were led by Philip Cezar, his brother David, and Jimmy Santos. Its entire starting line-up was later drafted in the Philippine Basketball Association. Francisco Calilan coached the Bombers in these five championships, and for 31 seasons from 1958 to 1989.\nStarting in 1987, Vergel Meneses led the Heavy Bombers, but would not able to lead them to the championship. \nIn 1999, JRC was defeated by the Letran Knights in a violence-marred title series. Two years later, now known as JRU, the Bombers lost to the San Sebastian Stags in the Finals. They would next make it to the Finals in 2008 led by John Wilson, but were defeated by the San Beda Red Lions. Coached by Ariel Vanguardia at this time, he coached JRU to three consecutive playoff appearances from 2007 to 2009, after which he resigned. Meneses would then coach the team from 2009 to 2018.\nIn Meneses' first season, they lost to the San Sebastian Stags in the semifinals, but had Wilson named as the MVP. Meneses further led the Bombers to semifinals finishes in 2010, 2011, 2014 and 2015.\nAfter finishing last place in 2018, and in order to run as mayor of him hometown in Bulakan, Bulacan, Meneses was replaced by former De La Salle coach Louie Gonzalez. JRU missed the playoffs in 2019. Under the bubble set-up, the Heavy Bombers won just once in the condensed 2021 season. JRU missed the playoffs again in 2022, but defeated Final Four qualifier Letran in their final game. The 2022 season was marked with John Amores going on a punching spree against Benilde Blazers players. Amores was then suspended for the rest of the season by the NCAA, and was removed from the team by JRU.\nCurrent roster.\nNCAA Season 98"

        "text": "Sean Christian Smith (born December 24, 1999) is an American professional basketball player for the Iowa Wolves of the NBA G League. He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins. He earned first-team All-Pac-12 honors as a junior in 2020, when he was also named the conference's most improved player. Undrafted out of college, Smith signed a two-way contract to play with the Detroit Pistons of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and their development team, Motor City.\nEarly life and high school career.\nSmith's father, Sean, was his coach in middle school. During his first two years at Fort Worth Country Day School, Smith was the quarterback on the football team in addition to playing basketball. He grew between his freshman and sophomore years in high school. He transferred to Huntington Prep School. In January 2017, Smith announced he would reclassify from the class of 2018 to the class of 2017. A three-star recruit, Smith signed with UCLA after considering offers from Oregon, TCU, Michigan, Ohio State, North Carolina, and Virginia Tech.\nCollege career.\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" described Smith as \"a 6-foot-9, 215-pound string bean\" that \"played his first slate of nonconference games for the Bruins at 17, sprinkling enticing potential atop a mound of mistakes.\" He averaged 3.9 points and 1.9 rebounds per game as a freshman but struggled with turnovers. In his sophomore season, Smith scored in double figures in his first five games but only reached double figures scoring in five of the remaining games. He averaged 6.3 points and 3.7 rebounds per game as a part-time starter, making 28.1 percent of his three-point field goals. \nDuring his junior year in 2019–20, Smith averaged 11.1 points per game during nonconference play as the Bruins went 7–6. He improved his performance during the season, posting his first double-double of 17 points and 12 rebounds on January 2, in a win against Washington followed by 22 points in a loss to Washington State. Smith scored a career-high 30 points on January 31, in a 72–68 win against Colorado. Smith led UCLA in scoring with 13.1 points per game as well as averaging 5.4 rebounds, 1.6 assists and 1.0 steals per game. He helped the Bruins finish second in the Pac-12 Conference and was named first-team All-Pac-12 as well as the conference's most improved player. Following the season, Smith declared for the 2020 NBA draft, but he later withdrew, returning to UCLA for his senior season.\nEntering the 2020–21 season, Smith was named to the preseason watch lists for the Naismith College Player of the Year, John R. Wooden Award and Julius Erving Award. On December 31, 2020, he suffered a knee injury in the first half against Utah but returned in the second half. However, he was later diagnosed with a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and ruled out for the season. Smith had been inconsistent on offense, but he was having his best game of the season against the Utes, making all six of his first half shots and finishing the game with 16 points in 22 minutes. He ended the season with averages of 12.6 points and 6.4 rebounds, which were both second on the team at the time. After undergoing knee surgery, Smith spent a month away from the team before returning to rehabilitate with UCLA staff and supporting the team from the sidelines. He was not expected to be able to resume basketball activities until the fall. After the season, Smith declared for the 2021 NBA draft while retaining the option to return to UCLA. An extra year of eligibility was granted to athletes because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but he later confirmed that he was remaining in the draft.\nProfessional career.\nAfter going undrafted, Smith was named to the Detroit Pistons roster for the 2021 NBA Summer League, but he was not expected to play because of his injury. On August 17, 2021, he signed a two-way contract to play with the Pistons and the Motor City Cruise of the G League. On March 8, 2022, Smith injured his left knee against the Canton Charge. He underwent an ACL reconstruction procedure on March 29 and was ruled out for the remainder of the season. On April 3, he was waived by the Pistons without playing an NBA game. In 18 games with Motor City, he averaged 8.7 points, 5.3 rebounds and 1.1 assists.\nOn January 1, 2023, Smith was acquired via waivers by the Salt Lake City Stars, but was waived on November 9. On November 24, he joined the Grand Rapids Gold, but was waived on December 9 only to rejoin them six days later. On January 2, 2024, he was waived by the Gold, but rejoined them on January 8, lasting five days until being waived.

They were fifth in the standings at 5 wins and 7 losses, while UE was fourth with a 7–5 record. They were also hoping for the Red Warriors to lose their remaining two games for a playoff to happen.\nThe game resulted to a two-point loss for UST. The Tigers had struggled throughout the game with errors and inconsistencies. Their opponent had led by 22 points at the end of three quarters.

When he was 15, Williams participated in the 1977 Centrobasket for the Virgin Islands national basketball team. He was the youngest member of the team.

They did so because the university was able to reach an agreement with the newly opened New Haven Arena and the Yale men's team possessed its first permanent home venue. They played their first game at the arena on December 16 against the New Haven Hockey Club, losing a disjointed game 1–4.\nThe team played twice over the winter break, with its full regular lineup, and broke even in the matches at the St. Nicholas Rink. When the Elis played their next home game the team had rounded into form and played a strong game against the Aggies, winning their first intercollegiate game of the year. Yale continued to beat up on the smaller colleges, winning twice more before heading to Canada for a match against Toronto. The Bulldogs played poorly in the first half, surrendering 3 goals to the Blues but recovered their game in the second. The team outplayed Toronto but couldn't overcome the sizable lead and returned to the States after a 2–3 loss.\nYale won one more game before their showdown against defending champion Princeton. The Tigers, however, were missing much of the previous year's offense and the Elis were able to hold Princeton to a single goal in a 3–1 win. A few days later the team was in Boston for a game against Harvard. The Crimson goaltender Wylie was the star of the game, turning aside many good shots for a 4–2 win over the Elis.\nThe Elis continued to burnish their record with wins over McGill and Dartmouth. They lost a close match to the St. Nicholas Hockey Club due to the incessant attack led by Hobey Baker. A few days later the team faced Baker's alma mater in a rematch. Despite their reduced offense, Princeton was able to restrict Yale to a single goal and captured the game in overtime, necessitating a third game three days later.\nThe rubber match was another tight checking battle with both defenses playing well. It was Yale's defense that held throughout the game, however, and the three goals from the Elis allowed them to win the game and capture the first series for the team since they had begun three years earlier. The rematch with Harvard happened just three days later and with the IHL series on the line the Elis had no margin for error. Yale played a tremendous game, outshooting Harvard 24 to 13, but the Harvard netminder was again the hero and Harvard skated away with the 3–1 win, along with a series victory and the Intercollegiate Championship.\nThomas Connors served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#00356B\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 1988–89 Florida Gators men's basketball team represented the University of Florida as a member of the Southeastern Conference during the 1988–89 NCAA men's basketball season. They were coached by Norm Sloan, who was in his ninth consecutive (and final) season at the school.\nThe Gators were ranked in the AP preseason poll for only the second time in program history despite the loss of both starting guards from the previous season, Vernon Maxwell and Ronnie Montgomery. They were expected to be led by steady senior guard Clifford Lett and star center Dwayne Schintzius, but while Lett stepped into his new starting role with aplomb, Schintzius was suspended four games for getting involved in an altercation outside a Gainesville nightclub in which he allegedly wielded a tennis racket.\nSchintzius' temporary absence contributed to a disappointing start to the season, and the Gators' record stood at 5-7 after losing their first conference game in early January. However, the team improved markedly from that low point, with the turnaround beginning during a key conference road game at Vanderbilt. Florida committed a turnover with one second remaining while trailing 72-70, seemingly sealing a loss. However, before play resumed, several tennis balls were tossed onto the court from the stands, apparently in taunting reference to Schinztius's earlier altercation. The officials called a technical foul on the home team, and Schintzius hit the resulting two free throws to send the game into overtime. He then scored Florida's first seven points in the extra period to lead the Gators to an 81-78 win. The improbable win was the second victory in what grew into an 11-game conference streak that ran from mid-January until early March.\nThe Gators ended the season one game ahead of Vanderbilt and Alabama in the conference standings to earn the program's first ever regular season SEC basketball championship. They were the runners-up to Alabama in the SEC tournament and received their third consecutive at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as a #7 seed. However, a poor shooting performance led to an upset loss to Colorado State in the first round, ending the Gators' season.\nFlorida was again ranked in the AP preseason poll leading up to the following season, but days before the first game in November 1989, Sloan was forced to resign due to an NCAA investigation into the program. Dwayne Schintzius quit the team over conflicts with interim coach Don DeVoe, and the program's streak of consecutive NCAA tournament appearances ended in 1989-90 with their first losing record in six years.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| SEC tournament\n!colspan=9 style=| NCAA tournament"

It was the inaugural final of the CONCACAF Nations League, an international soccer competition involving the men's national teams of the member associations of CONCACAF. The match was originally scheduled to be held on June 7, 2020, at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, United States. On April 3, 2020, the final tournament was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On July 27, 2020, CONCACAF announced that the Nations League Finals would be held in March 2021, though on September 22, 2020, CONCACAF announced that the event was again rescheduled until June 2021.\nThe United States won the final 3–2 after extra time to become the first champions of the CONCACAF Nations League.\nVenue.\nThe final was played at Empower Field at Mile High, an American football venue in Denver, Colorado. The venue seats 76,125 spectators (although COVID-19 regulations at the time of the match artificially reduced capacity by 50%), and is primarily used by the Denver Broncos of the National Football League, but had hosted the Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer in the past.

The match was broadcast in Mexico by Televisa and in Canada by OneSoccer.\nMatch.\nFirst half.\nMexico wasted little time opening the scoring, as forward Jesús Corona intercepted a poor pass by US defender Mark McKenzie in the attacking third and fired a shot past goalkeeper Zack Steffen and into the back of the net just over a minute into the contest. Mexico continued to apply pressure, and appeared to double their lead when Héctor Moreno headed the ball into the back of the net off a free kick, but VAR judged Moreno to be offside, and the goal was disallowed. \nFour minutes later, the United States equalized when a Christian Pulisic corner kick found the head of Weston McKennie. While his attempt at goal struck the post, the rebound fell to Giovanni Reyna, who easily scored from close range to make it 1–1, which would stand as the scoreline until half-time.\nSecond half.\nThe United States made several threatening attempts to take the lead off of set pieces, notably two headed attempts at goal by McKennie and McKenzie, both of which required impressive diving saves by Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa. In the 67th minute, Zack Steffen suffered an injury and was replaced by Ethan Horvath. \nIn the 79th minute, Mexico substitute Diego Lainez broke the deadlock mere minutes after coming on, dribbling past US defender Tim Ream before slotting a left-footed shot beyond the outstretched arms of Horvath to restore Mexico's lead. However, three minutes later, the US would equalize again, as McKennie headed a Reyna corner that grazed the fingertips of Ochoa but ultimately found the net, making the score 2–2. Following an acrobatic diving save by Horvath, denying Hirving Lozano a would-be winner in stoppage time, and a brief delay following offensive Mexican chants from the crowd, the full time whistle sounded and the match proceeded into extra time.\nExtra time.\nMexico controlled most of the game in the first extra session, but could not convincingly threaten the United States' goal, and the first 15 minutes ended goalless. \nIn the second period, Pulisic was brought down in the box. While play initially continued, VAR eventually alerted the referee, who awarded a penalty to the US after consulting the review monitor. In the 114th minute, Pulisic successfully converted the spot kick with a strike into the upper-right corner of the goal, giving the US their first lead of the match 3–2. \nImmediately, Pulisic took off his shirt, running towards the left-side corner flag joined in celebration by his teammates and taunting the Mexico fans by putting a finger to his lips. Some of the fans responded by throwing projectiles onto the pitch toward the US players, one of which hit Reyna in the head. Reyna briefly fell to the ground in pain but was ultimately not seriously injured.\nMexico would have one final chance to send the match to a penalty shoot-out, which would have been the first in the 87-year history of the Mexico-United States rivalry. With time winding down, a header from a Mexican corner struck the hand of McKenzie inside the box. This was initially unspotted, but following consultation with VAR, the referee awarded Mexico a penalty. In stoppage time, Mexico captain Andrés Guardado stepped up to take the penalty, which was met with a save by Horvath. Minutes later, the final whistle sounded, giving the United States their first non-friendly victory over their arch-rivals since a World Cup qualifier in 2013, and their first defeat of Mexico in a CONCACAF final since the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup final.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section end=\"Final\" /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules"

        "text": "The 2020–21 Road Safety World Series was the inaugural season of the Road Safety World Series, a Twenty20 cricket league featuring retired international cricketers. It was organised by the Road Safety World Series to raise awareness about road safety. The 2020–21 edition of the series featured players from India, England, Sri Lanka, West Indies, South Africa, Australia and Bangladesh. Sunil Gavaskar, former India captain, was the commissioner of the series, while Sachin Tendulkar was its brand ambassador.\nBackground.\nThe Road Safety World Series was founded by Ravi Gaikwad and approved by the Board of Control for Cricket in India. The first edition of the tournament began in March 2020, with the tournament taking place at venues in Mumbai and Pune in India. The tournament was to be played in a round-robin format with the top two finishers playing the final.\nOnly four matches were played in 2020 and on 13 March, as a result of an advisory by Indian Government following the COVID-19 pandemic, the remaining seven matches were rescheduled to a later date. Initially it was decided that the remaining matches would be played behind closed doors at DY Patil Stadium; but the tournament was later indefinitely postponed.\nInstead of starting afresh in 2021, the organisers opted to resume the previous edition. Bangladesh Legends and England Legends were added to the tournament after Australia Legends opted out due to COVID-19 restrictions making overseas travel impossible for Australians.\nVenues.\nThe 11 matches were initially scheduled to be played at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai, and MCA Stadium in Pune with the final initially scheduled for 22 March 2020 in Pune. In 2021 the remaining matches were held at Raipur.\nLeague stage.\nAll times are in to Indian Standard Time (IST).\n2021.\nThe remaining six group matches were rescheduled to 2021. With Australia unable to play their matches, all matches involving the side were ruled as walkovers, with the opposing side gaining four points. With the expansion of the tournament the number of group-stage matches increased.\nKnockout stage.\nThe knockout stage started with semi-finals at Raipur, the winners of each progressing to the final at Raipur. If any match ended in a tie, a Super Over would be used to determine the winner. If the scores in the Super Over were also tied, the winner would be determined by another Super Over and continues, until the team wins the Super Over.\nOn 10 March 2021, Sri Lanka Legends became the first team to qualify for the semi-finals after beating Bangladesh Legends at Raipur. Three days later, saw tournament hosts India Legends, the second team to qualify after they defeated South Africa Legends at Raipur on 13 March 2021. The following day after, South Africa Legends became the third team to qualify after they beat Bangladesh Legends at Raipur on 15 March 2021. The following day, in the final match of the league stage, West Indies Legends and England Legends played for the final spot in the semifinals. Eventually, West Indies Legends became the fourth and final team to qualify for the semi-finals after they beat England Legends in a virtual quarterfinal match.\nThe first semi-final was played between India Legends and West Indies Legends at Raipur, while the second semi-final was played between Sri Lanka Legends and South Africa Legends at the same venue again.\nSemi-finals.\nThe first semi-final between India Legends and West Indies Legends was played at Shaheed Veer Narayan Singh International Cricket Stadium in Raipur on 17 March 2021.\nBatting first, India Legends got off to a fantastic start, but lost opener Virender Sehwag, after he gave Indians the perfect start, having scored 35 runs. However, the Indians continued their high scoring rate, as Sachin Tendulkar combined with Mohammad Kaif and Yusuf Pathan for partnerships of 53 and a quick 31 respectively. Tendulkar scored 65 runs before he was the third man out in the 14th over. After his dismissal, Yuvraj Singh combined with Yusuf Pathan for an unbeaten partnership of 78 runs, also scoring a quickfire unbeaten 49* from just 20 deliveries, which included 6 sixes, out of which 4 came in 18th over bowled by Mahendra Nagamootoo. The Indian Legends finished with a score of 218/3, after a fantastic display of batting at the end of their 20 overs.\nThe West Indies Legends saw William Perkins fell to Manpreet Gony in the second over, but the West Indians scored 71/1 in the first six overs, with Dwayne Smith combining with Narsingh Deonarine going berserk after the Indian bowlers. After a partnership of 99 runs for the second wicket between Dwayne Smith and Narsingh Deonarine, Smith was dismissed for 63. After Kirk Edwards was stumped by Naman Ojha off Pragyan Ojha’s bowling, falling for a first-ball duck, Brian Lara was joined by Narsingh Deonarine for a partnership of 80 runs for the fourth wicket that left West Indies Legends needing 32 runs from the final three overs; however, after the dismissal of Brian Lara and Narsingh Deonarine, within a span of 4 runs and good tight bowling by Vinay Kumar, Manpreet Gony and Irfan Pathan, Indians managed to stop West Indies Legends at 206/6, entering into finals of Road Safety World Series.\nThe second semi-final saw Sri Lanka Legends take on South Africa Legends at Shaheed Veer Narayan Singh International Cricket Stadium in Raipur on 19 March 2021.\nSri Lanka Legends won the toss and chose to field first. South Africa Legends made a steady start to their innings but lost Andrew Puttick in the third over. Alviro Petersen was joined by Morné van Wyk and combined for a 53 runs partnership. Apart from these batsmen, no other batsman could significantly contribute towards the total as they lost wickets at regular intervals. Nuwan Kulasekara ran through the South African batting lineup and took 5 wickets. Somehow, the South African Legends managed to score 125, with Morné van Wyk top-scoring with 53.\nSri Lanka Legends took their time to get going in the run chase but were soon making progress before Tillakaratne Dilshan was dismissed by Makhaya Ntini for the first wicket. Quick-hitting Sanath Jayasuriya with Upul Tharanga had a small partnership of 39 runs before Petersen dismissed Jayasuriya for 18 runs. Chinthaka Jayasinghe promoted up the order, started to smash bowlers all over the park, while Tharanga played the anchor's role in the chase. The Sri Lankan Legends successfully chased the target with more than two overs to spare and saw them entering the finals against India Legends, to be played on 21 March 2021.\nStatistics.\nThe top 5 players in each category are listed."

        "text": "The 1911–12 Yale Bulldogs men's ice hockey season was the 17th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nYale began the season looking to recover from a poor showing in 1911. After opening with a win over St. Paul's School, Yale headed into their winter break with two 3-game series on the slate. They met Princeton in Cleveland and got their first look at one of the game's rising stars, Hobey Baker. Yale played admirably, winning the last game in overtime, but it was clear that the Bulldog defense had its hand's full with the Tiger rover. The Elis fared better in the series with Cornell, taking the first two games from the defending champions before the Big Red offense awoke for the third match.\nThe team returned home and had to wait more than a week for the next game. When it came the Elis welcomed MIT for the first game at their new on-campus rink. The facility was a temporary erection near Yale Field and the Bulldogs christened the venue with a 5–3 victory where they demonstrated a great deal of teamwork.\nWith Harvard having withdrawn from the IHA, Yale's biggest competition for the crown came from Princeton but they were sure to receive a fight from Cornell as well. In the match against the Big Red the two teams fought to a 1–1 tie after regulation. The team captains agreed to play one overtime sessions which would only end once a goal had been scored. The sudden death session continued unabated for 25 minutes and 8 seconds before Archer Harmon scored to give the Elis the win. The game set a record for the longest overtime period played at the St. Nicholas Rink.\nAfter downing Mass Ag 3–0 the Bulldogs faced Princeton in what was expected to be the game to ultimately decide the IHA champion. Neither team was able to score in the first half, with Yale's defense playing particularly well. The Elis opened the scoring with a goal from Cox but afterwards Hobey Baker took over the game. In the final 17 minutes he scored a hat-trick and assisted on a fourth goal to give Princeton a 4–1 victory and all but seal their league championship. Despite the disappointment Yale's season was far from over and they responded with two wins before their third league game.\nColumbia entered the game with neither team having much chance for the title but that didn't stop the two teams from producing a very competitive game. The pair battled to a 3–3 tie at the end of the first half but Columbia took over in the second, scoring four times en route to a 7–4 win. The team avoided disaster in the following game by producing a 4-goal second half to overcome a 2-goal lead to down Dartmouth. The game was notable for most of the regular defensive corps being absent, including Carhart who was replaced in net by Thayer.\nYale ended its season with a best of three series against Harvard. Poor ice hampered both teams in the first game but it was the home Crimson who were able to earn the win with their typical oppressive defense. Line juggling and a change of venue allowed Yale to even the series a few days later despite a furious attack by Harvard at the end of the game. In the final game, however, Harvard opened with the first four goals, all in the first half, and Yale could not come back from such a deficit. The Elis fell to the Crimson 4–2, ending the season with a loss that must have left a sour taste in their mouths despite posting a winning record.\nThe team did not have a coach, however, Esmond O'Brien served as team manager.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#00356B\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 2018–19 Oberliga season was the 60th season of the Oberliga, the third tier of German ice hockey. The Oberliga operated with two regional leagues, North and South. 25 teams competed in the season that lasted from 21 September 2018 till 30 April 2019. The Tilburg Trappers and EC Peiting won the North and South premierships respectively. EV Landshut was crowned Oberliga champion for winning the playoffs, and by doing so they also secured promotion to DEL2. EHC Waldkraiburg, EC Harzer Falken, and ECC Preussen Berlin were all relegated to the Regionalliga.\nTeams.\nOberliga North planned to expand to a sixteen team competition for 2018/19. However, those plans did not eventuate when the champions of Regionalliga North (Weserstars Bremen), East (ELV Tornado Niesky) and West (Herforder EV) all declined promotion to Oberliga North. The runners-up of each league also declined to submit an application for a licence. As such, the relegation of EC Harzer Falken was overturned and the team from Braunlage remained in the league. In August 2018, EHC Timmendorfer Strand 06 withdrew from the league and filed for bankruptcy. Oberliga North started the season with 13 teams.\nOberliga South planned to expand to a fourteen-team competition for 2018/19. However, those plans were scrapped when the league was unable to find any suitable candidates in the Regionalliga East, South-West, or Bavaria. Deggendorfer SC left the league after being promoted to DEL2. Regionalliga South-West champion, SC Bietigheim-Bissingen U23 was unable to join the league due to the club having their first team in DEL2. TEV Miesbach also left the league after being relegated the previous season. Joining the league was the recently relegated DEL2 team, Bayreuth Tigers. On 16 May 2018, the DEL2 team SC Riessersee also joined the league after having their DEL2 licence cancelled. SC Riessersee had a protracted negotiation with DEL2 but ultimately was unable to agree to rejoin the league. SC Riessersee then agreed to join Oberliga South for 2018/19. Oberliga South admitted the team with strict conditions, including Riessersee not being able to participate in the championship playoffs and being forced to participate in the relegation playoffs regardless of their regular-season performance. Oberliga South started the season with 12 teams.\nOberliga North.\nOberliga North ran from 21 September 2018 till 3 March 2019. The league operated with a 48-match (4 matches against each team) regular season. The top six teams automatically qualified for the championship playoffs. The next four teams advanced to the qualification playoffs, playing for two final spots in the championship playoffs. Teams finishing eleventh to thirteenth had their season end after the regular season. The thirteenth team would be relegated to the Regionalliga. After 26 days into the season, the Hamburg Crocodiles opened insolvency procedures, however, they were allowed to continue to compete during the regular season. The Oberliga board decided to impose the same conditions on Hamburg as they did SC Riessersee, the Crocodiles would be excluded from the championship playoffs. If they finished within the qualification positions, the next team below the qualification positions would take their place. \nQualification playoffs.\nTeams finishing seventh to tenth play best of three match series in the qualification playoffs to determine the final two places from Oberliga North in the Championship playoffs. Due to Hamburg being excluded and finishing ninth, Erfurt Black Dragons, who finished eleventh, progressed to the qualification playoffs instead. The matches occurred between 5 March and 10 March 2020.\nOberliga South.\nOberliga South ran from 28 September 2018 till 10 March 2019. The league was broken into two stages. Stage one, the regular season, had all twelve teams compete in a home and away round before splitting into two regional groups for a second home and away round for a total of 32 matches. The top ten teams advanced to the Oberliga South qualification round to determine the league premier and eight qualifiers for the Oberliga championship playoffs. Normally the bottom two teams advanced to the relegation playoffs with eight Bayernliga teams, however, due to SC Riessersee entry conditions to the league, the bottom team and Riessersee would advance to the relegation playoffs.\nRelegation playoffs.\nTen teams took part in the relegation playoffs. Eight Regionalliga teams and two Oberliga teams. The top two teams from the eighteen match playoffs would qualify for the Oberliga in 2019/20. The bottom eight would qualify for the 2019/20 Regionalliga. SC Riessersee topped the playoffs to retain its status as an Oberliga team. EHC Waldkraiburg finished ninth and was relegated from Oberliga. EV Füssen secured promotion to Oberliga after finishing second.\nChampionship playoffs.\nThe championship playoffs to determine the Oberliga champion and promotion to DEL2. The championship playoffs consisted of eight teams each from North and South who play a best of five series elimination format from the round of 16 to the Oberliga final. EV Landshut won the championship final series 3:2 over Tilburg Trappers to be crowned Oberliga-Meister and secure promotion to DEL2."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Rams represent Fordham University in the NCAA's Atlantic 10 Conference.\nFordham began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1902. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Fordham's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "Charles Frederick \"King\" Kelly (June 14, 1887 – May 31, 1974) was a Canadian amateur and professional ice hockey centre forward, primarily active during the 1910s. He played four games for the Vancouver Millionaires of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association during the 1919 season. Kelly's career span over six provinces across Canada as he played in Ontario, Québec, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, British Columbia and Alberta.\nHe died in Calgary on May 31, 1974, at an age of 86.\nCareer.\nKelly began his career in his home town of Arnprior where he represented the Arnprior Shamrocks in the Upper Ottawa Valley Hockey League (UOVHL). Arnprior Shamrocks claimed the 1910 UOVHL championship title on March 16, 1910, by defeating the Pembroke Hockey Club 3 goals to 2 in Renfrew and Kelly scored two of the goals for Arnprior, including the game winning 3-2 goal in the second half of the game.\nKelly played in Montreal during the 1910–11 and 1911–12 seasons, in the city league and in the Interprovincial Amateur Hockey Union (IPAHU), with the Montreal Stars and the Montreal Shamrocks, and during the 1911–12 season his younger brother Ernie Kelly joined him playing on the Stars and the Shamrocks.\nIn 1912–13 and 1913–14 Kelly played for the Grand-Mère HC from Grand-Mère in Québec, in the IPAHU. Grand-Mère HC won the IPAHU championship both in 1913 and 1914. In 1913 Grand-Mère HC won league honors by defeating the Ottawa New Edinburghs in the final 7 goals to 4 over two games (7-1, 0-3), and in 1914 the club again emerged victorious in the IPAHU and challenged the Regina Victorias for the Allan Cup, but the Victorias held on to the Allan Cup by defeating Grand-Mère 10 goals to 5 over two games (6-4, 4-1) on home ice in Regina.\nKelly joined the Winnipeg Victorias in the Winnipeg Amateur Hockey League for the 1914–15 season, but mostly appeared as a spare player during the season behind Alex Romeril. He did start a league game at his natural centre forward position on January 21, 1915, against the Winnipeg Hockey Club, a game which the Victorias won 11 games to 5, with Kelly scoring a goal off of Percy Galbraith's skate.\nThe three following seasons, between 1915 and 1918, Kelly played hockey in Saskatoon (with the Saskatoon Pilgrims and the Saskatoon Quakers) where he was a prolific scorer. The March 5, 1917, issue of the \"Saskatoon Daily Star\" concluded that Kelly had not lost his speed from his Grand-Mère days and that he had also added more cunningness to his game, and that he had a \"flip\" shot that caused disruption for the opposing goaltenders.\nPCHA stint and Big-4 League.\nFrank Patrick of the Vancouver Millionaires of the PCHA signed Kelly from the Vancouver Shipyards Coughlans well into the 1919 season, on January 31, and used him as a spare player for the rest of the regular season. Kelly was given sweater #10 with the Millionaires, but he did not score any goals for the club.\nKelly joined the Calgary Columbus Club of the Alberta Big-4 Hockey League for the 1919–20 season, where he became a teammate of Mickey MacKay who had also starred on the 1919 Vancouver Millionaires in the PCHA. While not playing hockey with the Columbus Club Kelly worked as an insurance adjuster.\nAfter his playing career was over Kelly stayed in Calgary, and in the 1930s he acted both as a hockey coach and as a referee in the city. In 1935–36 he coached the Calgary Rangers of the Alberta Senior Hockey League."

        "title": "Maryland–Virginia lacrosse rivalry",
        "text": "The Maryland–Virginia lacrosse rivalry (or Virginia–Maryland lacrosse rivalry) is an intercollegiate lacrosse rivalry between the Virginia Cavaliers and Maryland Terrapins. The teams first met in 1926 and have met 96 times, the second-most for UVA and third-most for UMD against any opponent. The two are some of the most historically successful intercollegiate programs, combining for twenty-one national titles, ten of which have come in the NCAA era. The Cavaliers and Terrapins were league foes in the Atlantic Coast Conference from 1954 to 2014, before Maryland joined the Big Ten the following year. The teams ceased their annual matchup until a meeting five years later in the 2019 NCAA Lacrosse Championship, won by Virginia on the way to their sixth NCAA championship. The 2020 season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but games have resumed since.\nThese rivals have met twice to decide national titles, with Virginia winning their fifth and seventh NCAA championships (in 2011 and in 2021) over Maryland in hotly contested title matches. They had previously met once in the semifinals, in 2003, with the Cavaliers defeating the Terps en route to Virginia's third NCAA championship.\nMaryland leads the all-time series 50–47 through 2024, but Virginia has held the upper hand, 39–21, since 1980.\nSeries history.\nMaryland's early dominance (1926 to 1968).\nThe series was dominated by Maryland early on, with each of the first four meetings being no closer than nine goals. After five games in six years, the series would go on an 18-year hiatus before resuming as an annual fixture in 1950. Virginia grabbed its victory in nine tries with a five-goal win in College Park.\nThe following year, the teams would meet in 1954 as conference foes for the first time. Maryland continued its early series dominance in response to its first series loss by reeling off another eight consecutive victories. Virginia would snap that streak with its first home victory in 1962, before closing the decade with its first victory in College Park since 1953 in a 9–7 win. A victory the following year would be the final before the advent of the NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship. At the end of this era, Maryland would hold a commanding 21 to 5 series lead, punctuated by its eight-game winning streaks.\nThe advent of the NCAA tournament and rise of Virginia as a major lacrosse power led to a hotly contested period in the series's history. However, the Terps would win the final five meetings of the 1970s, including their first meeting in the postseason, a 15 to 10 victory in the 1978 quarterfinals.\nVirginia's modern dominance (1980 to present).\nVirginia would grab the initiative in 1980, winning seven of the next eight, though Maryland would again top the Cavaliers in the 1983 quarterfinals. Since 1980, the Cavs have won 37 of 55 meetings to narrow Maryland's series lead to just two games. Nonetheless, the meetings have often been between top five ranked teams and have led to numerous classic games. One of the most significant was the sole meeting in 2009, the longest lacrosse game in NCAA history. An unintentional whistle by the officiating staff negated what would have been a game-winning goal by Terrapins attackman Grant Catalino in the first overtime. After seven overtime periods, the Cavaliers finally put away Maryland with the game-winning tenth goal to prevail 10–9, and preserved its perfect record, 11–0. The game would ultimately be the determinant in the ACC regular season championship, as the Terrapins' loss tied them with Virginia in a split title.\nWith the advent of the ACC postseason lacrosse tournament in 1989, the two teams would meet even more frequently. The programs would meet 14 times in the ACC postseason, with UVA holding a 8–6 lead in these games. In the NCAA tournament, the Cavaliers hold the series lead at four victories to three, winning each of the last four matchups. The most significant NCAA meeting occurred in the 2011, as Virginia downed the Terps in the title game by two goals to win their fifth NCAA championship.\nAfter the Terps departed the ACC for the Big Ten, they would not play the Cavs again until the 2019 edition of the NCAA tournament. Old sentiments stirred again in a controversial Virginia victory in the quarters. While Maryland controlled much of the match and held a commanding five-goal lead at one point, the Cavaliers rallied in the fourth quarter, helped by a critical call that attackman Michael Kraus' shot was deemed a score despite clanging off the post. Virginia took the opening faceoff in overtime, and Matt Moore scored 45 seconds later to propel the Cavaliers into the semifinal and end the Terps’ season short of the final four for the first time since 2013. UVA would ultimately defeat Yale in the final to win their eighth national championship. In 2020, the teams were scheduled to resume the rivalry with a regular season matchup that was ultimately cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nVirginia narrowly defeated Maryland, 17–16, in the Championship Game of the 2021 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship to win their second consecutive and seventh overall NCAA Championship, and their second in a decade won by way of defeating Maryland in an NCAA title match.\nRival accomplishments.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs."

        "text": "The Creighton Bluejays basketball statistical leaders are individual statistical leaders of the Creighton Bluejays basketball program in various categories, including points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Bluejays represent Creighton University in the NCAA Division I Big East Conference.\nCreighton began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1916. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Creighton's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.\nThese lists are updated through Creighton's game against Princeton in the Sweet Sixteen of the 2023 NCAA tournament."

        "text": "The 1918–19 Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey season was the 21st season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nWhen World War I ended in November, many American servicemen began to return home. With a transatlantic flight having yet to be completed, the weeks-long sea crossing was the quickest way to return home. It was no mean feat for Harvard to play its first hockey game exactly two months after the ceasefire, but the team was aided by the informal team that had played during the previous winter.\nThe ice hockey team had to overcome an additional hardship due to their home rink, the Boston Arena, having been seriously damaged by fire shortly after the War ended. On short notice the team was able to secure the Charlesbank Rink for three games, so named due it being located on the banks of the Charles River, near where the Daly Memorial Rink currently sits (as of 2020). The team played the Boston Hockey Club on January 11 and swiftly surrendered two goals to their opponents. Harvard redoubled their efforts to cut the lead in half before the end of the half and then allowed Avery to score twice in the second half to complete his hat-trick earn the win for the Crimson.\nIt would be almost three weeks before the team would play their next game, but by that time they had settled on a captain. Robert Gross, who had bee on the 1917 squad and led the informal team the year before, was chosen to lead the squad once more. The first match with Gross as captain was against the Camp Devens team and, despite playing on soft ice, Harvard was able to overcome the larger team. \nThe next night the Crimson faced Boston College for the first time in their history. Harvard was dominant in the inaugural game for what would become an enduring cross-town rivalry.\nAfter a second win over the Boston Hockey Club, Harvard headed south to renew its rivalry with Yale at the Brooklyn Ice Palace. Harvard jumped on the Elis early, scoring twice in the first seven minutes of the game and adding a fourth just before the end of the half. The second was a more even period but the Crimson skated away with a 4–1 victory. The following week Harvard headed up to Concord, New Hampshire, for a narrow victory over St. Paul's School that was marred by soft, slushy ice, and then returned to Brooklyn for their final game against Princeton. The Tigers blitzed Harvard early, scoring 45 seconds into the match, but Harvard settled the game down afterwards and scored three timed before Princeton could tally again. The Crimson were utterly dominant in the second half, possessing the puck for much of the time and scoring four times to take the match with a convincing win.\nHarvard finished the season with a perfect record, including wins over Princeton and Yale, but with so few teams playing and most competing in only a handful of games, Harvard would not lay any claim to a championship. They would, however, use their success in 1919 as a springboard for the following year with a full season expected.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "Army–Navy lacrosse rivalry",
        "text": "The Army–Navy lacrosse rivalry is an intercollegiate lacrosse rivalry between the Army Black Knights and the Navy Midshipmen. The two programs, historical rivals in other sports like football and soccer, have a fierce and nationally-relevant rivalry in lacrosse as well. With 25 national championships, 10 Final Fours in the NCAA era, and 190 consensus first team All-Americans, the two teams have been integral to the game's history. The rivalry carries a different spirit than many others in collegiate lacrosse, described by former Navy goalie Ryan Kern as: \"t’s the same camaraderie that you had in the fall with the football game and it kind of comes out again in the spring with the lacrosse game,” Navy junior goalie Ryan Kern said. “No doubt, all the other sports are important, but just the sheer number of people that come to this game is crazy — just like the football game. You see 16,000 people come to a regular season lacrosse game, and that’s not happening at other lacrosse programs.\" After 103 meetings, Navy leads the series 63–37–3 through 2023.\nSeries history.\nPre-NCAA era (1924 to 1970).\nThe teams first met in 1924, with the Midshipmen shutting out Army 5–0 in West Point. The rematch occurred the next year in Annapolis, the second of four consecutive Navy victories to begin the series. A tie in 1928 was part of the Midshipmen's first national championship season and 7–1–1 record. That game was followed by a three goal Army win five years later, their first in the rivalry; the series has been played annually since. The 1940s were a high point for the rivalry, as Army would capture national championships in the 1944 and 1945 seasons, sharing the '45 title with the Midshipmen. Navy campaigns in 1943, 1946, and 1949 also resulted in titles during this period.\nAnother crucial period began in the late '50s, as either Army or Navy won at least a share of the Wingate Memorial Trophy every year from 1958 to 1970. The lone exception during this stretch was 1968, when Johns Hopkins won the national championship outright. Navy's dominance over the sport was only checked by the Black Knights, the only team from the 1959 to 1966 to defeat the Mids. '61 and '63 victories in Annapolis by the Cadets were the only by a collegiate program during this period. Both teams entered the 1964 game with identical 8–0 records, with Navy pulling off their first win of four straight victories.\nNavy dominance (1970s to 2010).\n1970 ended with a three-way split of the national title between Navy, Hopkins, and Virginia. In the final game, Navy prevailed over Army to complete its undefeated season and secure a share of its 17th national title. The following year, the first NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship was held. The 1971 edition featured both the Cadets and Midshipmen, who both fell in the Final Four. Beginning in 1973, the Naval Academy would win its first of nine consecutive against Army, including a 16–13 victory in the 1978 NCAA tournament. The quarterfinals matchup was led by two Mids players, Mike Hannan and Mike Buzzell, with 6 and 5 goals respectively. In 1981, the Black Knights would halt the streak with a one goal victory in Annapolis. However, a postseason rematch would go the way of the Midshipmen. Outscoring Army nine to three in the second half, Navy would prevail 16 to 10.\nIn 1991, Army would join the Patriot League and relinquish its previous status as an independent program. The Midshipmen would abstain from conference membership until 2000, when it joined the ECAC Lacrosse League. Despite being a full member of the Patriot League since 1991, Navy would finally move its lacrosse program to the conference in 2004. That season would be the best for the Mids since the 1970s, as they captured both the regular season and conference tournament championships. That included an 18–10 victory over #9 Army in their first conference meeting. In the 2004 NCAA Championship, Navy would earn the 2 seed and make a run to the title game against the Syracuse Orange. A Michael Powell game winner capped a 3–1 Syracuse run in the final five minutes to deny the Mids their first NCAA title.\nSubsequent years would generally not be kind for the Cadets. From 1973 to 2009, Navy would go 34–8 against Army, including a 13 game winning streak spanning 1998 to 2007. While Army would snap that streak in 2008 with a nine to six victory, the Cadets would not win more than two consecutive games until 2010.\nRecent years (2010 to present).\nIn 2010, Army won their first of six straight games against Navy, their longest streak in the rivalry's history. A 2011 victory in Annapolis was the Cadets' first since the 1997 campaign. Since 2015, the series has been relatively balanced, with the Midshipmen taking four of seven matchups. This has included two overtimes games, a 2016 victory for the #9 Mids to clinch the league title and a 2019 win for #20 Army, the 100th game in the rivalry's history. In the Patriot League tournament, the teams have split six meetings, three of which came in the final. After the 2020 game was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the teams met again in 2021, with #16 Navy pervailing over #10 Army 9–4. Army won the latest meeting in 2023, 11-6.\nRival Accomplishments.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs."

        "text": "Ian Mitchell (born January 18, 1999) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman for the Providence Bruins of the American Hockey League (AHL) while under contract with the Boston Bruins in the National Hockey League (NHL).\nPlaying career.\nCollegiate.\nMitchell was selected 57th overall by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft, but committed to play college ice hockey at the University of Denver starting in the 2017–18 season. Mitchell immediately found success on Denver's blue line, scoring two goals and 28 assists in 41 games for the team. Denver would win the 2018 NCHC Tournament, securing an automatic bid in the 2018 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey tournament. However, the Pioneers would fall in the second round of the tournament to the Ohio State Buckeyes.\nMitchell was named an alternate captain for the 2018-19 season. He would put together another good season, scoring six goals and 21 assists. Despite falling early in the 2019 NCHC Tournament, Mitchell and the Pioneers still qualified for the 2019 NCAA tournament, where they would put together a run to the Frozen Four before losing to the UMass Minutemen.\nMitchell considered going pro and signing with the Blackhawks prior to the 2019–20 season, but elected to stay with Denver, where he would be named captain. He would put together his most successful collegiate season, scoring a career high 10 goals, as well as 22 assists for 32 points. For his efforts, he was named AHCA First-Team All-American. Denver was set to play the Omaha Mavericks in the 2020 NCHC Tournament, but the tournament was canceled before any games were played due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, the 2020 NCAA tournament was also cancelled.\nProfessional.\nChicago Blackhawks.\nMitchell decided to forgo his senior season at Denver, and signed an entry-level contract with the Blackhawks on April 11, 2020.\nMitchell made the Blackhawks' opening night roster to start his delayed rookie season. Mitchell would log his first NHL point on January 22, 2021 against the Detroit Red Wings with an assist on a goal by Calvin de Haan. He would then later score his first NHL goal on February 11, 2021 against the Columbus Blue Jackets. Although not a lineup regular, Mitchell stayed with the NHL club for the majority of his rookie season, finishing with three goals and four assists in 39 games.\nIn 2021–22 Mitchell would not find the same NHL success that he found in his rookie season, as he spent the majority of the year with the Blackhawks AHL affiliate, the Rockford IceHogs. In the AHL, he scored 11 goals and 24 assists for 35 points in 57 games. He would also play in five playoff games, registered a goal and assist before the IceHogs were eliminated in the second round by the Chicago Wolves. Mitchell managed to play with the NHL club for eight games, registering a lone assist.\nAlthough he started the 2022–23 season with the IceHogs again, Mitchell was called up on November 18, 2022. After that, he served as a reserve body for Chicago's defense, rotating in-and-out of the lineup as needed, but could not lock down a consistent spot in the everyday lineup. He would score a goal and add seven assists in 35 games with the Blackhawks.\nBoston Bruins.\nOn June 26, 2023, as an impending RFA, Mitchell was traded by the Blackhawks to the Boston Bruins with Alec Regula in exchange for Taylor Hall and Nick Foligno, reuniting him with his head coach from Denver, Jim Montgomery. Mitchell signed a one-year, two-way contract worth $775,000 with the Bruins on July 10, 2023, avoiding arbitration.\nMitchell would win the seventh defensemen job out of training camp for the Bruins, and would start the season on the NHL roster. Mitchell would score his first point as a Bruin with an assist on a goal by Matt Poitras against the Anaheim Ducks on October 22, 2023. Mitchell was placed on waivers on October 25, but cleared. Mitchell was quickly called back up a few days later, after playing a few games for the Bruins AHL affiliate, the Providence Bruins. However, on December 29, 2023, Mitchell was once again put on waivers, and once again cleared. Mitchell would spend the rest of the regular season playing for Providence, helping them to a playoff berth in the 2024 Calder Cup playoffs."

However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Arkansas's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.

It is owned by Bob Parsons, an American entrepreneur, who is the founder of GoDaddy and Parsons Xtreme Golf, and his wife, Renee, president of PXG Apparel. The property provides an uncontested 360-degree views and is protected on three sides by preservation wilderness.\nHistory.\nUntil 2013, the course was known as The Golf Club of Scottsdale. It was renamed by Parsons after he acquired the golf course for $600,000. In 2014, he unveiled a $35 million plan to redevelop some of the course's holes and build a new clubhouse. Since that time, a second clubhouse and member villas have been constructed, and Parsons has invested about $250 million in the property.\nScottsdale National Golf Club now consists of two 18-hole courses and a nine-hole course. The original course, called \"Mine Shaft,\" is a par 72 spread across 290 acres (1.2 km2) designed by Jay Morrish and Dick Bailey. The second course, called \"The Other Course\" is a par-72 links course designed by Jackson Kahn Design. The 9-hole par-3 course is called \"The Bad Little Nine,\" also designed by Jackson Kahn Design. According to Today's Golfer, the 9-hole course is considered as one of the \"“trickiest”\" courses in the world. Parsons has kept an offer on the table to give a golfer $1,000 if he or she finishes under par when the flags are in their trickiest locations.\nThe club also has an extensive practice facility, which includes a driving range more than 400 yards deep, a short game area, and five different bunker and green scenarios.\nIn 2017, construction was completed on new contemporary villas for members, which feature local artwork, as well as a second clubhouse. Members can bring guests and stay on property to golf, dine, access the spa facilities and other amenities.\nTournaments.\nSNGC hosts the annual \"Wild West Invitational\" tournament. It's a three-day event for women and a four-day event for men with luxury food and drinks, and gifts for all of the players. The player's objective is to win their flight and proceed to the final round, called \"The Stampede\". In \"The Stampede,\" competitors must contend with a number of distractions that could include mobile deejays with music blaring over loudspeakers, sounds of jackhammers and helicopters, and even Bob Parsons heckling players with a bullhorn.\nGolf Immersion Program.\nThe \"Xperience\" is a three-days golf immersion program at SNGC that includes PXG club fittings for two people by a PXG master fitter. The day after the clubs are fitted, they are delivered to the participants for their playing rounds on all three golf courses. The \"Xperience\" also includes a tour of the club, accommodations and dinners."

        "text": "The 1916–17 Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey season was the 20th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nWith many of the players from the consecutive championship teams returning, it was a bit galling for Alfred Winsor to watch his team play so poorly in their first game against the Boston Athletic Association. Despite the loss of wingers Kissel and Bliss the hard practices arranged by Windsor seemed to wake up the Crimson and the team responded with a convincing 7–2 win over the Boston Hockey Club.\nAfter the winter break, Harvard played their first official game of the year, trouncing MIT 8–0. After a second shutout, this time over Dartmouth, Harvard left its home rink for the first time to play Princeton. The Tigers played Harvard tough all game long, attacking the Harvard net whenever they could. The first half ended with both team tied at 1, and the staunch defensive work from both goaltenders continued in the second half. Just when it looked like overtime would be needed, Princeton captain Schoen scored the winning goal with 15 seconds to play, putting a wrench in the works for Harvard's championship hopes.\nBefore the rematch Harvard faced Queen's and were able to exact their revenge from a year before with a 5–1 victory. Harvard flipped the script against Princeton by scoring first and keeping the pressure on the Tiger net, but Schoen scored twice in response to give Princeton a 2–1 lead at half. Harvard was undeterred and scored three times in the third period, carrying the play for most of the second half. Schoen completed his hat-trick late in the game but it was too late to change the outcome and Harvard tied the series to keep their championship window open. A week after a shutout of McGill, Harvard began their series against Yale in New Haven, and once more the Crimson offense couldn't get on track away from Boston. Yale's goaltender, York, stifled Harvard all game long, leading the Elis to a 2–0 win and the first shutout of Harvard by a contemporary in over seven years. The victory was the first for Yale over Harvard since February 1914, but the Crimson would still have a chance to redeem themselves before the season ended.\nWhile Harvard was eager to even the series against Yale, they had to play the rubber match against Princeton first. With the game at home Harvard had the advantage, and a sterling effort from the defense allowed Wylde to record his fourth shutout of the season and gave the series to the Bostonians. With the Tigers thus defeated, Harvard was two wins away from another intercollegiate championship and after they evened the series with Yale by another shutout, it appeared that they were heading for a third consecutive title. Unfortunately, their final game against Yale took place at the New Haven Arena, with a rink much smaller than the Crimson were used to at the Boston Arena. With the captains for both teams sitting out, the Elis relied on their speed and tenacity to keep Harvard at bay. The tactic worked and Yale were able to shut Harvard out for the second time, winning the series 2–1.\nBecause Princeton had triumphed over Yale, the three teams found themselves locked in a three-way tie in the IHL standings. Rather than try to determine a sole champion the tie was allowed to stand, leaving 1917 without a team able to claim the intercollegiate championship.\nWylde tied his program record with 5 shutouts on the season. His 10 career shutouts was an unofficial team record until 2005.\nLess than a month after the season ended, the United States formally entered World War I. As a result, the ice hockey program was mothballed until after the armistice was signed on November 11, 1918.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Billikens represent Saint Louis University in the NCAA's Atlantic 10 Conference.\nSaint Louis began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1915. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Saint Louis record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

He was described as the most 'acute of these [secretaries], wearing his two hats with vast aplomb from 1928 to 1949.'\nThe book \"Rummle them up! The Border Rugby Story\" explains the difficulties of holding the Border League and District Union post at the same time:\n[The secretary] could never allow his left hand to know what his right hand was doing. League and Union representatives would meet in the same place on the same night, in a quorum composed of much the same people, but the secretary kept two minute books, one for Union eyes, the other strictly for home consumption in the League. \nAt a Gala rugby dinner as SRU representative, Hogg responded to a question about the press picking the Scotland international team instead of the SRU selection committee. His response was scathing of the press:\nIt would be a revelation to see the team chosen by experts of the Press, especially if the responsibility was on their shoulders. It must be apparent to the public that the sensational titbits which appeared about rugby football, were, with a few exceptions. only a prostitution of the game. They wrote their puerile nonsense about the game for personal gain, and a friend of his had ranked them as second rate prostitutes. Personally, he only disagreed with that in a matter of degree; he would say they were third rate!\nHogg was elected Vice-President of the SRU in 1956.\nHe became the 71st President of the Scottish Rugby Union. He served the standard one year from 1957 to 1958.\nOutside of rugby union.\nHogg was made the Chairman of the committee for the Galashiels festival, the Braw Lads Gathering, in 1939."

She soon began taking ice skating lessons and began playing in a local co-ed recreational team, but wouldn't join a competitive hockey team until she was 11 due to a lack of ice hockey programs for girls in her area. During high school, she attended the National Sports Academy in Lake Placid, New York and played four seasons with the school's women's ice hockey team in the Junior Women's Hockey League (JWHL).\nFrom 2010 to 2014, she played NCAA Division I women's ice hockey with the Providence Friars women's ice hockey program of the Hockey East conference, scoring 60 points (16 goals + 44 assists) across 136 games played. As a freshman, she was named the February 2011 Hockey East Rookie of the Month and was selected for the Hockey East All-Rookie Team. In 2013, she was named a All-Hockey East Honorable Mention on defense.\nAfter her career with the Friars concluded, she took a few years off from playing hockey to complete her master’s degree, before returning to sign as a practice player with the New York Riveters (renamed Metropolitan Riveters in 2017) for the 2016–17 NWHL season. She moved up to becoming a roster player for the team in the 2017–18 season, in which she picked up her first career NWHL goal and helped the Riveters to their first Isobel Cup victory.\nShe was named an alternate captain for the Riveters ahead of the 2019–20 season. That year, her fourth in the NWHL, she was named to the All-Star Game for the first time, with a career-high 11 points in 24 games, leading all Riveters defenders in scoring, and was honoured with the NWHL Foundation Award.\nMorse re-signed with the Riveters for the 2020–21 NWHL season.\nOn August 11, 2021, Morse signed with the Connecticut Whale of the NWHL (later renamed PHF) for the 2021–22 PHF season after playing 5 seasons with the Metropolitan Riveters.\nPersonal life.\nMorse's hockey nickname is \"Moose\" and her teammates regularly refer to her as such in interviews.\nShe has a bachelor’s degree in marketing and a MBA from Providence College. Outside of hockey, she worked full-time in marketing in Manhattan until she laid off when her role was cut due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its financial implications for her employer. She served as a communications intern for the New Jersey Devils in 2015.\nShe has been a resident of Roselle, New Jersey.\nMorse is an out lesbian and is an outspoken advocate for LGBT rights and racial justice."

        "title": "Bill Walsh (rugby league)",
        "text": "William George Walsh was a New Zealand rugby league player. He first played for New Zealand in 1919 on the tour of Australia and became Kiwi number 122. He ended with 8 matches for New Zealand in total playing one test against Australia. He played his entire club career with the Ponsonby United club in the Auckland Rugby League.\nPlaying career.\nPonsonby United.\nIn 1914 Bill Walsh was tipped to make the Ponsonby senior team after previously having played in their second grade team, and to go on to representative honours. He was described as a “fast and tricky player”. Indeed, he was to debut for their senior side this year playing alongside Kiwi legend Thomas McClymont. He would go on to play for Ponsonby for 11 seasons from 1914 to 1924 which was an extraordinary period of time in that era, particularly for one club. He was part of their team which won 3 titles in 1917, 18 and 19. They were the first club to do this. He also won the Roope Rooster with Ponsonby in 1917, 1922, and 1923. In his 11 years with the Ponsonby senior team Walsh scored 17 tries and kicked 3 goals.\nAuckland debut.\nWalsh made his representative debut for Auckland in 1915 against Thames. Auckland won the match 27 to 16 at Victoria Park in front of 4,000 spectators. He was unfortunate, in terms of his representative career, in that his early playing years occurred during the war. Auckland Rugby League had made the decision to play little to no representative matches in this time. In the 4 years prior to the outbreak of war Auckland played 34 representative matches while during the 4 years of the war this dropped to just 8. His second match for Auckland was in the return match against Thames when the team travelled to their opponents home and went down 13–25. They travelled by boat on board the Wakatere along with 350 supporters.\nIn 1917 Walsh played in a charity match for the combined Ponsonby-North Shore team against a City-Newton combined team. The match was to raise money for the family of the late William Mackrell. Ponsonby-North Shore won the match with Walsh scoring 2 tries. Despite being a back Walsh was not renowned for his try scoring ability, averaging around 2 tries a season throughout his career. In 1918 Walsh played in a Thacker Shield match for Ponsonby against Sydenham in Christchurch. Ponsonby was the challenging team as Sydenham were the holders. Ponsonby won 11–0 to bring the trophy to Auckland where it would remain for several years until a ruling by New Zealand rugby league. They ruled that the trophy had originally been donated and intended to be played for by rugby league teams in the South Island. Walsh scored a try in the win.\nIn 1918 Walsh played for Auckland in a 45-9 thrashing of Canterbury at the Auckland Domain in front of 10,000 spectators.\nNew Zealand selection.\nThe 1919 season was to be the most significant season for Walsh as he gained selection for the New Zealand team on their tour of Australia. He played in 5 of the 11 tour matches playing in the halfback position in each of them. His New Zealand debut was against New South Wales Firsts in an 18–23 defeat on June 17 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in front of 46,157 spectators. He played again in the second tour match against the same opponent with New Zealand losing 9-20. Walsh experienced a win in a New Zealand jersey for the first time in their 11–8 victory over Northern Division at the Newcastle Showgrounds with Walsh scoring a try. He scored again against the New South Wales Firsts team in a high scoring match with New Zealand going down 31-39 before 20,000 fans at the Royal Agricultural Society Showground in Sydney. Walsh's last tour match was to be in the 6th match of the tour. Walsh was paired with the prolific Karl Ifwersen in the halves and New Zealand ran the New South Wales team close before going down 19–22. Walsh was injured in the match and was unable to play again in the tour.\nHis one and only test was against Australia when they toured later in the 1919 season. New Zealand suffered a 23–34 loss at the Auckland Domain in front of 24,300 spectators. Walsh played halfback alongside George Bradley at standoff.\nWalsh played for Auckland on August 20 against King Country at the newly opened Carlaw Park. Auckland trounced their opponents 58–25.\nBoating tragedy.\nOn April 1, 1923 Walsh was involved in a serious boating accident on the Tairua Bar which claimed the lives of 4 people. He was one of seven onboard the launch, Lorraine when it capsized shortly before 9pm on the Tairua Bar. The boat had attended a regatta at Whitianga when it was returning. There was a strong wind and heavy seas at the time. The deceased were William Southernwood (a Ponsonby teammate), H Chappell, T Culhane, and N Robson all of Auckland. When the launch capsized Walsh and T Jenkins were trying to retrieve the dinghy when Walsh got his feet tangled in fishing line. Three breaking waves then struck them smashing the boat into \"matchwood\". One of the survivors, Silston Cory-Wright had managed to secure a benzine tin to hold on to in the water. Walsh was described as being \"nearly done for\" but was saved by Cory-Wright who had also cleared Walsh's feet of fishing line from which he had become entangled and reached him with the benzine tin. Cory-Wright then managed to put a life belt over Walsh's shoulders and kept him afloat until they could be pulled onboard. Both men were described as being \"in a pretty bad way\". Prime Minister William Massey telegraphed to Tairua his sincere sympathy from himself and his wife for the bereaved relatives. Walsh recovered sufficiently and was able to assume the position of club captain which he had been elected to for the 1923 season.\nRetirement.\nIn 1928 Walsh turned out for a charity “Old Timers’ Match” as curtain raiser to the Newton Rangers v Ponsonby United Roope Rooster semi-final replay."

Gus Hornfeck was replaced as coach by former assistant and captain of the '10 team, Clarence Peacock with several players from the previous year's squad serving as assistants. After several days of practice the final cuts produced a varsity team that had few returning players.\nPrinceton began their season well, winning three of four to start with only Boston Athletic Association able to stop the Tigers. Despite the wins there was concern for the team after it was barely able to defeat Mass Ag. Regardless of the worries, Princeton went 2–1 over the following week as the team geared up for the championship series with Harvard and Yale.\nPrinceton produced a paltry effort against the Crimson, losing 1–4. After a week off there was no improvement to their game as Harvard won the rematch 5–1. Princeton was heading for a terrible end to their season after a loss in the first match with Yale but the team recovered for the second contest, holding the Elis to a single goal with captain Grant Peacock scored both goals in a double overtime win. While they couldn't sustain the level of play, losing the rubber match to Yale, Princeton's win against the Bulldogs did provide hope for the future of the young team.\nAfter the season John Humphreys was named as a first-team all-collegian.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

Players have several available gameplay modes such as a story mode along with additional single and multiplayer settings. The game allows players to choose from seven available character models to start a career with. Players do not have a preset skill level for each character, and the game allows players to instead determine their skill with Skill Points to be distributed among the attributes of Distance, Accuracy, Control and Recovery.\nDevelopment.\nIn 1999, many third-party developers, including T&amp;E Soft, joined Sony. Not only that but according to IGN, Sony \"showed how another winning characteristic that helped to launch it to the top of the console heap\". On February 8, 2000, T&amp;E Soft announced a release postponement for the game. The game was announced as a PlayStation 2 launch title in Japan, and was scheduled for release on March 23, 2000, priced at 5,800 yen (around $54 US). The game was later shown at the PlayStation Festival in 2000. Before the game was released in Japan, Sony released the demo of the game via a shady source.\nOn May 26, 2000, Electronic Arts picked up the publishing rights to the title.\nOn October 12, 2000, Electronic Arts promoted to advertise the game in the United States. The ad covered a two-page span, where the left three-fourths of the spread shows two golfers at urinals holding golf bags on their backs. The golfer on the left is smaller but has a larger golf bag holding a variety of clubs, while the larger golfer on the right the right has a tiny bag with only a couple of clubs. The text written in the upper left hand corner of this layout says, \"Whoever has the most toys wins.\" The game was released in the United States on October 26, 2000, the same date as the launch of the PlayStation 2.\nReception.\nThe game received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\"IGN\" member David Zdyrko praised the graphics as \"beautiful\" for a PS2 game. He stated it was \"a lot like Hot Shots Golf with some cool improvements, as well as some minor downfalls.\" He also stated that it \"might not be as great as Hot Shots Golf, but it's a phenomenal golf game nonetheless.\" \"GameSpot\"s Frank Provo said that the Japanese import is \"a game whose features and execution could barely be explained by a book, let alone by a review.\" \"GameRevolution\"s G-Wok called the game \"a fun little golfer whose attitude and extras keep the game from getting too dull.\" He did criticize the loading screens and stated that \"some problems with minor slowdown and the lack of creative courses are a disappointment, but the game doesn't suffer too greatly.\" \"NextGen\"s Blake Fischer said, \"If you want a middle-of-the-road game for your PS2 and you dig golf this might be worth a try, but you're probably better off waiting for \"Tiger Woods [PGA Tour] 2001\".\" In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of 27 out of 40."

        "text": "Major League Baseball (MLB) and the MLB Players Association (MLBPA) announced the creation of a domestic violence policy in August 2015. Officially, the domestic violence policy is included within the broader Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Policy. According to the policy, the Commissioner can place any player suspected of domestic violence, sexual assault, or child abuse on administrative leave for up to seven days while conducting an investigation. The Commissioner can choose to suspend or reinstate the player, or can defer judgment until after criminal proceedings conclude. The policy does not include minimum or maximum punishments.\nUnder baseball's collectively bargained policy, players undergo mandatory domestic violence training once a year in spring training. MLB conscripted a San Francisco-based nonprofit, Futures Without Violence, to spearhead its training program. The nonprofit is also part of MLB’s joint committee on domestic violence, a collaboration between the players’ union and the commissioner’s office.\nPrior to MLB's 2015 policy on domestic violence, no club took disciplinary action against a player accused of or arrested for domestic violence until the Boston Red Sox suspended Wil Cordero in 1997 following a domestic violence arrest. In March 2016, the league suspended Aroldis Chapman for 30 games following an alleged incident between Chapman and his girlfriend. He was the first player suspended by the league following the implementation of the league-wide policy."

        "title": "Arthur Matthews (rugby league)",
        "text": "Arthur Matthews (1889–?) played for the New Zealand rugby league team in 1919 on their tour of Australia. He was Kiwi number 117. He played in 3 tour matches but did not play in any tests as there were none played on this tour. He lived in Auckland and played for the Ponsonby United and North Shore Albions senior teams from 1915 to 1920.\nPersonal life.\nHe was born on 28 June 1889. The son of Louisa and Charles Matthews. He had several siblings. They were Clara Louisa (b.1879), Florence Sarah (b.1881), Charles Bosley (b.1883), NR (b.1885), Eric William (b.1899), and May Elizabeth (b.1892). It appears that he later moved to Australia and died in Western Australia in 1951.\nPlaying career.\nArthur Matthews began his career playing for Ponsonby United in the Auckland Rugby League competition. He played for them in the 1915 and 1916 seasons. He was an electrician by trade and in 1917 he volunteered for the war effort on 16 March while he was living in Thames. After being physically examined he was declared fit for active duty though he never went away to fight.\nHe was involved in some controversy early in the 1917 season. He and his brother (W Matthews) turned out for the North Shore Albions without having formalised a transfer. Grafton Athletic protested and the Auckland Rugby League stood down both players and stated that the match should be replayed. It was later reported that it was an oversight as W Matthews had just returned from war service and had played some matches for Ponsonby 3rd grade team years earlier, while the Ponsonby 3rd grade team had withdrawn from the competition due to a lack of playing numbers. As a result, the Ponsonby club had granted both brothers transfers. The transfers were duly processed allowing Arthur Matthews to turn out for North Shore in their second round match against City Rovers.\nIn 1918 North Shore were forced to withdraw from the senior competition due to a lack of playing numbers. Many sports were struggling at this time because so many of their players had gone away to fight in the First World War. As a result, Matthews transferred back to the Ponsonby club where he played for the remainder of the season. He played for them in their Thacker Shield winning effort where they beat Sydenham in Christchurch 11–0 and scored a try\n. In 1919 the North Shore team was revived and he returned to them. This was to be the most impressive season of Matthews career.\nIn May 1919 he played in a trial match to make the New Zealand team. The match was played at Victoria Park and he was listed in the centres. Subsequently, he was selected for the New Zealand team on their 1919 tour of Australia. He was named in the reserves to play for New Zealand in a warm up match against Auckland but did not take the field.\nMatthews played in 3 of the 11 tour matches, being used in 3 different positions. He debuted for New Zealand against Tamworth on 11 June, playing in the centres. New Zealand won the match 21–13. His next match was against Ipswich Firsts on 26 June, where he played fullback in an 11–8 win. He kicked a goal and this was to be his only points for New Zealand. His third match was against Rockhampton on 9 July. This time he was to play in the halfback position and this was to be the last game he would play for New Zealand. New Zealand would also win this match 23–0.\nUnusually Matthews did not represent Auckland until after he had played for New Zealand. Partly this was due to the fact that so few Auckland representative matches were played in previous seasons due to the war. He played for the “Rest of Auckland” team against the touring side on their return. Auckland was to lose 30–45 in front of 6,500 spectators at Victoria Park. This was to be the only time he pulled on the Auckland jersey.\nIn 1920 he again turned out for the North Shore team but at the end of the season on 8 September he was granted an open transfer by the Auckland Rugby League to play for any club outside the Auckland league district in their weekly meeting. It is unknown as to where he was moving to or if he played again."

        "title": "Equestrian statue of Henry Warner Slocum",
        "text": "The equestrian statue of Henry Warner Slocum is a monumental statue in Brooklyn's Grand Army Plaza, in New York City. The equestrian statue, designed by sculptor Frederick William MacMonnies, was dedicated in 1905 in honor of Henry Warner Slocum, who served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War and later as a U.S. Representative from the state of New York.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nHenry Warner Slocum was born in Delphi Falls, New York in 1826. After attending the Cazenovia Seminary and the State Normal School at Albany, he enrolled in the United States Military Academy in 1848. Graduating four years later, he would go on to serve as an officer in the United States Army until the 1850s, when he resigned to practice law and participate in local and state politics. At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, he resumed his military career and served as an officer in the Union Army, rising to the rank of major general by the end of the war. He participated in several major battles, including the First Battle of Bull Run, the Battle of Gaines' Mill, and the Battle of Gettysburg. Following the war, he moved to Brooklyn, New York, where he served several terms as a member of the United States House of Representatives. He died in 1894 in New York City.\nCreation.\nFollowing his death, several Brooklynites began to organize efforts to erect a monument in the city in his honor, with the location of the monument to be determined by the municipal authorities. While planned to initially be funded through donations, it was soon decided that public funds would be used. In 1895, the city government of Brooklyn passed a law allocating funds to the erection of the statue, the cost of which was not to exceed $30,000. American sculptor Frederick William MacMonnies, who at the time was operating out of Paris, was contracted to design the statue. He completed the casting of the statue by 1900, and the statue was shipped to Brooklyn in 1902. However, the statue was kept in storage for some time as the pedestal and foundation were being prepared. The pedestal was designed by architect Stanford White, with the location of the monument being the intersection of Eastern Parkway and Bedford Avenue.\nDedication.\nThe monument's dedication ceremony occurred on Memorial Day, May 30, 1905. The largescale ceremony commenced with a playing of the song \"Hail, Columbia\", followed by an invocation by Bishop Frederick Burgess of the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island. Park commissioner Michael J. Kennedy then presented the statue, which was unveiled by the 6-year-old granddaughter of Slocum. The statue was then accepted by New York City Mayor George B. McClellan Jr. on behalf of the city of New York. \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was then played before a keynote speech was given by President of the United States Theodore Roosevelt. A benediction was then given by Bishop Charles Edward McDonnell of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn. The ceremony ended with a playing of \"America\", followed by a gun salute. A parade followed down the parkway, with Roosevelt reviewing it.\nIn 1924, the monument was moved to the intersection of 15th Street and Prospect Park West, and was again moved to its current location at Grand Army Plaza in 1928.\nDesign.\nThe monument consists of a bronze equestrian statue atop a granite pedestal. On either side of the pedestal are two large bronze medallions, while a bronze eagle with outstretched wings is affixed to the front. Slocum, holding a sword upward, faces to the right. The only inscription on the pedestal is the name \"SLOCUM\". According to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, the monument's pedestal measures approximately tall and covers an area of approximately by . The statue itself stands an additional atop the pedestal. While initially facing west from the intersection of Eastern Parkway and Beford Avenue, the monument now stands at Grand Army Plaza, east of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Arch, near East Plaza Street, where it faces towards Central Library.\nArt historian Kathryn Greenthal compares the \"dramatic image\" of Slocum raising his sword triumphantly to similar equestrian statues of the time, including Augustus Saint-Gaudens's General John Logan Memorial (dedicated in 1897). She claims that these statues are in the \"European tradition\" of such statues as Carlo Marochetti's \"Richard Coeur de Lion\" and Emmanuel Frémiet's \"Jeanne d'Arc\"."

        "text": "An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each team position—who in turn are given the honorific \"All-America\" and typically referred to as \"All-American athletes\", or simply \"All-Americans\". Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. The 2018 NCAA Women's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that will include All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), and the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) for the 2017–18 NCAA Division I women's basketball season. Both AP and USBWA choose three teams, while WBCA lists 10 honorees.\nA consensus All-America team in women's basketball has never been organized. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by AP, USBWA, the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), and the Sporting News to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus All-America men's basketball team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.\nBefore the 2017–18 season, it was impossible for a consensus women's All-America team to be determined because the AP had been the only body that divided its women's selections into separate teams. The USBWA first named separate teams in 2017–18. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA), continues the USBWA's former practice of selecting a single 10-member (plus ties) team. The Sporting News does not select an All-America team in women's basketball."

        "title": "Johns Hopkins–Syracuse lacrosse rivalry",
        "text": "The Johns Hopkins–Syracuse lacrosse rivalry is an intercollegiate lacrosse rivalry between the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays and Syracuse Orange. The two programs are the most historically successful and winningest in collegiate lacrosse, combining for 60 national titles spanning the pre-NCAA and NCAA eras. Since the advent of the NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship, the Syracuse and Johns Hopkins have the first- and second-most titles respectively. Hopkins leads the series 32–29–1 through 2024.\nSeries history.\nEarly years and rise to prominence.\nThe teams first met in 1921 after a hard-fought 4–4 draw. After several more contests in the 1920s and 1930s, they would not meet again until 1963, 29 years after their last meeting. The 60s resulted in five more Hopkins victories and the series did not develop sustained national significance until 1980. That season, the teams met in the NCAA Final Four, the first of 13 meetings between the two in the tournament. The Blue Jays won that initial postseason matchup 18 to 11 en route to its third consecutive national championship. Syracuse would grab its first victory since 1922 with a title showdown three years later, the first national title for the Orange since 1957. The teams would meet again the following year in the championship, with Hopkins prevailing 13–10. After this streak of significant matchups, the two athletics programs scheduled an annual game in the regular season, which has continued uninterrupted to this day. Following that Jays victory, Hopkins again prevailed in the third consecutive title game between the two in a strong 11–4 showing. 1986 snapped the streak of postseason meetings and Hopkins' nine consecutive title game trips, as both teams were felled in the Final Four. Syracuse took three of the next four meetings before the two capped the decade with a classic title game in 1989. The Orange defeated the Jays 13–12 behind the Gaits brothers Paul and Gary. The programs would meet again in the postseason in following years, with Syracuse taking four out of five contests in the 1990s and early 2000s. After splitting the 90s with six wins apiece, the Jays would win seven of the next twelve prior to 2008. Hopkins and the Orange would square off in the 2008 title game, the first between the two since 1989. The fifth game featured the Orange claiming their tenth NCAA title. Beginning with the 2008 season, Syracuse won eight of nine contests in a dominant stretch.\nRecent years (2010s to present).\nThe two programs, long proudly independent, would react to changing conditions in the collegiate lacrosse landscape during the 2010s. The significance of conference postseason tournaments in obtaining postseason bids, along with primary conference obligations for the Orange, led both to give up their independence. Syracuse joined its primary home, the Big East Conference in 2010, before lateraling to the ACC in 2014. Hopkins began exploring membership possibilities in 2013 after missing its first NCAA tournament since the inaugural contest, which broke the longest streak in history at 41 straight seasons. In 2013, the university announced that Hopkins would join the newly formed Big Ten Conference as an affiliate member for lacrosse, beginning with the 2015 season. On the field, Hopkins would snap the aforementioned Syracuse streak with a victory in the quarterfinals of the 2015 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship. The teams split the next four before Syracuse took the first contest of the 2020s with a 15–9 victory in Baltimore.\nRival accomplishments.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs."

        "text": "The 1985–86 Texas Longhorns women's basketball team represents the University of Texas at Austin in the 1985–86 college basketball season. It was head coach Jody Conradt's tenth season at Texas. The Longhorns were members of the Southwest Conference and played their home games at the Frank Erwin Center. They finished the season a perfect 34–0, 16–0 in SWC play to win the regular season and SWC tournament. They received an automatic bid to the NCAA women's basketball tournament where they defeated USC to win their first National Championship.\nNational championship.\nAfter earning a number one national ranking in 1984, but stumbling in the regional's finals to national power Louisiana Tech, Texas seemed poised for a better result in 1985. Not only did the team earn another top national ranking, but they entered the NCAA tournament knowing that if they reached the Final Four, they would have the home court advantage with the final games scheduled for their own Frank Erwin Center. Home court would play a part, but not the part hoped for by the Longhorns. In the regional semi-finals, played at the home court of Western Kentucky University, the Hilltoppers stymied the Longhorn's hopes with a 92–90 victory. They would return to the 1986 tournament viewed as one of the top teams in the nation and were once again ranked the top team in the nation, but they still did not have a Final Four NCAA appearance on their resume.\nThe Texas team won their first game easily, then continued to the regional, this time on their home court. They dispatched Oklahoma easily, then struggled against Mississippi, who were trying to prevent the team from a Final Four yet again. This time, Texas prevailed and beat Mississippi by three points to head to their first NCAA Final Four. Their opponent in the semifinal was none other than Western Kentucky, who had denied them the previous year. This time, the result would be very different, as the Longhorns beat Western Kentucky easily, 90–65.\nThe other semifinal pitted Tennessee against Southern California. Cheryl Miller was the best player at USC, and had led the team to the national championship in 1984. Miller went on to play for the USA national team and helped the USA win the gold medal at the 1984 Olympics. 1986 was Miller's senior year at USC. The game between Tennessee and USC was a rematch of a physical game played in December, in which Miller was thrown out of the game for an elbow. The game was close, but USC ended up with an 85–77 win. In the rematch, Miller would again come out of the game, but under very different circumstances. She was worried about getting hurt, and with a 70–51 lead, didn't need to stay in. In that game, USC won by 24 points, 83–59.\nThat set up the championship game between USC and undefeated Texas. The Texas team was very deep but had suffered a number of injuries during the year. The game was close early with the Trojans leading at times in the first half, but Texas went on a 10–2 run to take a seven-point lead. Miller would have one of the worst games in her career. Although she scored 16 points, twelve of those were from the free throw line. She was only 2 for 11 from the field, without a single point in the second half. In contrast, Texas' Clarissa Davis came off the bench to score 25 and earn Most Outstanding Player honors. USC's Cynthia Cooper scored 27 points, and Texas won the national championship 97–81 to complete the first undefeated season in NCAA history.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"| Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"| SWC women's tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"\"| NCAA women's tournament"

        "text": "The 2010 UST Growling Tigers men's basketball team represented University of Santo Tomas in the 73rd season of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines. The men's basketball tournament for the school year 2010-11 began on July 10, 2010 and the host school for the season was De La Salle University.\nUST finished seventh at the end of the double round-robin eliminations. They won four games against ten losses, giving head coach Pido Jarencio his worst win–loss record in the UAAP.\nThey had an average winning margin of 3.0 points and an average losing margin of 7.7 points.\nTwo of their games went into overtime. The first was an 87–81 win over the UP Fighting Maroons in the first round, and the other was a 76–81 double-overtime loss to the Adamson Falcons in the second round.\nThe Tigers tied Adamson's 2008 record of most three-point shots made in a game which they did twice, both in the first round. They made 16 three-point shots in their overtime win against UP and then repeated the feat against Adamson for a 55.2 field goal percentage.\nRoster changes.\nThe Growling Tigers have lost Season 72 MVP and scoring leader Dylan Ababou as well as Khasim Mirza and Allein Maliksi to graduation, while Tiger Cubs and incoming college freshmen Kyle Neypes and Cedric Labing-isa, both of whom were shoo-ins to the UST Senior team decided to join the rival NU Bulldogs.\nThis year's roster includes Season 72 Rookie of the Year Jeric Teng, three-point specialists Jeric Fortuna and Tata Bautista, and big man Chris Camus among a handful of veterans. Nearly half of the roster are rookies with Ilocos Norte standout Ed Daquioag who was a former high school teammate of Bautista and Cebuano guard Pipoy Marata, who was named NBTC's Most Outstanding Player leading the pack.\nSchedule and results.\nPreseason tournaments.\nIn October 2009, speculations that head coach Pido Jarencio had been fired began to surface. This was related to the past unsuccessful seasons that followed their 2006 championship. Manila Bulletin had written an article about it on October 5, but the school's Institute of Physical Education and Athletics officials, namely Director Fr. Ermito de Sagon and Assistant Director Mrs. Felicitas Francisco were quick to dismiss them as rumors. Jarencio's live contract will expire in March 2010 and from then officials will make an assessment of his tenure. The coach himself dismissed the rumor during an interview in July. He had confirmed receiving offers from the NU Bulldogs, but also said that he \"never thought of leaving UST unless they didn't want him there anymore.\"\nJarencio's contract was extended to December 2010.\nAccording to Jarencio, \"UST did not join the major preseason games for fear that it would affect the morale of the players.\" Another reason for skipping the summer tournaments, was the problems that they encountered in recruiting players. UST Tiger Cubs standouts Neypes and Labing-isa have decided to play for National University after graduation and are currently undergoing residency. Neypes was actually included in the Bulldogs' roster when they competed in the 2010 Filoil Preseason Cup.\nUAAP games.\nElimination games were played in a double round-robin formatt and all of UST's games were aired on Studio 23 and Balls.\nUAAP statistics.\nSource: inboundPASS\nAftermath.\nBecause the Growling Tigers did not participate in any major preseason tournaments, they were not scouted by the other UAAP schools and were able to pull off wins early in the first round of eliminations. They were even third in the standings at 3–2 at one point late in the first round.\nLike the other UST Growling Tigers teams, the 2010 squad had heavily relied on their three-point shooting, and when their shots had failed to connect, the losses began to pile up, mostly on double-digit deficits.\nAccording to head coach Pido Jarencio, this team was more of a stop-gap in preparation for the university's quadricentennial celebration. \"Some of the players I recruited are really made for 2011.\" One of the players that he was referring to was incoming Cameroonian rookie Karim Abdul who had undergone a one year residency and will be able to suit up for the Tigers next season to beef up the team's short front line.\nJarencio who has a deep pool of players from the Team B training team, has plans for a major revamp on the current team. \"If nothing happens (to UST) next year, I will exit the team,\" added the coach."

        "text": "Garrett Antony-Charles Mitchell (born September 4, 1998) is an American professional baseball center fielder for the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball (MLB). Mitchell was selected 20th overall by the Brewers in the 2020 MLB draft.\nEarly life and high school.\nMitchell grew up in Orange, California, and attended the Lutheran High School of Orange County, where he was a four-year member of the varsity baseball team. He was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes at nine years old.\nRegarded as a top collegiate prospect, Mitchell committed to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to play college baseball for the UCLA Bruins during his sophomore year at Lutheran. He batted .299 with 19 runs scored and 11 runs batted in (RBIs) despite a slow start as a junior. He played in the 2016 Perfect Game All-America Baseball Game and the Under Armour All-America Baseball Game.\nThe Oakland Athletics selected Mitchell in the 14th round (411 overall) of the 2017 Major League Baseball draft, but he opted not to sign with the team and attend UCLA. Mitchell played summer collegiate baseball after graduating high school for the Walla Walla Sweets of the West Coast League, batting .462 with one home run and four RBIs in 13 at-bats.\nCollege career.\nAs a true freshman, Mitchell was named the Bruins starting right fielder and the Preseason Freshman of the Year by Baseball America. Over 44 games, he batted .280 with 44 hits and 31 RBIs, missing time during the season due to health issues. Mitchell played summer baseball in the Northwoods League for the Mankato MoonDogs. During his sophomore year in 2019, he batted .349 with 14 doubles, 12 triples (a UCLA single season record), six home runs, 57 runs scored, and 41 RBIs and was named first team All-Pac-12 Conference and a third team All-American by the NCBWA and ABCA. Mitchell spent the following summer playing for the United States collegiate national baseball team.\nMitchell entered his junior season on the watch list for the Golden Spikes Award and as a top prospect for the 2020 Major League Baseball draft. Mitchell batted .355 with nine RBIs and 18 runs with five stolen bases before the season was cut short due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nProfessional career.\nThe Milwaukee Brewers selected Mitchell in the first round, with the twentieth overall pick, in the 2020 Major League Baseball draft. He signed with the Brewers on July 7 and received a $3.2 million bonus. Mitchell was named to Milwaukee's 2021 Spring Training roster as a non-roster invitee and batted .367 with one home run and six RBIs in 22 games.\nMitchell was assigned to the High-A Wisconsin Timber Rattlers to start the 2021 season. He was promoted to the Double-A Biloxi Shuckers in early July after slashing .359/.504/.620 with five home runs, 33 runs scored, 20 RBIs, and 12 stolen bases over 28 games with the Timber Rattlers. Over 35 games with Biloxi to end the season, he batted .186/.291/.264 with three home runs and ten RBIs over 35 games. He missed time during the season due to a leg injury.\nMitchell returned to Biloxi to start the 2022 season. He suffered an oblique injury in May and was placed on the injured list until July 7, 2022, after a rehab assignment with the Arizona Complex League Brewers. Mitchell batted .277 with four home runs and 25 RBIs in 44 games with the Shuckers before being promoted to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds.\nOn August 27, 2022, the Brewers selected his contract from Nashville, promoting him to the major leagues. He missed the phone call from Sounds manager Rick Sweet informing him of his promotion to the majors, telling reporters it was because he was eating a chocolate chip cookie. He made his debut later that day, playing center field at the end of the game. He had his first major league start the day after, on August 28, playing center field and batting 9th. His first at-bat resulted in a flyout to left field.\nHis second at-bat was his first major league hit, a two RBI double into centerfield that gave Milwaukee the lead. He hit his first home run against Wil Crowe of the Pittsburgh Pirates in the bottom of the eighth inning on August 29, 2022. Mitchell completed the 2022 season batting .311/.373/.459 with 19 hits, 2 home runs, and 9 RBI, all in 28 games. \nMitchell made the opening day roster for the Brewers, and also made the starting lineup, batting 7th and playing center field. On April 2, Mitchell hit his first MLB career triple, a sharp line drive to right field, driving in Brian Anderson. Two days later, in a game against the New York Mets, Garrett had his first career two home-run game. On May 4, Mitchell underwent shoulder surgery to repair the labrum in his left shoulder. According to manager Craig Counsell, the procedure was likely to end Mitchell's season. On September 28, Mitchell was activated from the injured list. He played in 19 total games for Milwaukee in 2023, hitting .246/.315/.446 with three home runs and seven RBI.\nIn 2024, Mitchell suffered a broken left hand in spring training and was placed on the injured list to begin the season. He was transferred to the 60–day injured list on April 14, 2024.\nPersonal life.\nAt the age of 9, Mitchell was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, which he regulates with an insulin pump. \nIn 2021, Mitchell married professional softball player Haley Cruse."

Instead of contesting the final at a later date, the two clubs shared the cup.\nRoute to the final.\nThe competition is a knock-out tournament and was contested by 58 teams from Scotland, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in 2019–20. The competition was originally only contested by clubs in the Scottish football league system, but teams from Wales and Northern Ireland were added from 2016–17, the Republic of Ireland in 2017–18, and two teams from the English National League (fifth tier) were added from 2018–19.\nMatch details and cancellation.\nInverness player James Keatings was initially suspended for the final, having been sent off for being shown two yellow cards during the semi-final. An appeal against one of those cards, and the resulting suspension, was rejected by a Scottish Football Association panel. A new appeal hearing was convened when one of the panel members advised the SFA that they had not considered all of the available evidence. This second panel rescinded one of the cards, which would have made Keatings available to play in the final. \nThe match was originally scheduled for 28 March 2020, but all of Scottish football was suspended on 13 March due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Scottish Football Association confirmed on 16 March that the SPFL had postponed the match, pending further information from the Scottish Government about when and how football could be resumed. When the SPFL announced in October 2020 that the 2020–21 edition of the competition had been cancelled, it also said that the 2019–20 final would \"be scheduled for a date later this season\", i.e. during 2020–21.\nOn 30 April 2021, it was announced that the 2019–20 final would not be played and that both clubs would share the title instead."

        "text": "The Northeastern Huskies men's basketball statistical leaders are individual statistical leaders of the Northeastern Huskies men's basketball program in various categories, including points, three-pointers, assists, blocks, rebounds, and steals. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Huskies represent Northeastern University in the NCAA's Colonial Athletic Association.\nNortheastern began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1920. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Northeastern's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

On March 6, 2021, UNC completed a season sweep over rival Duke in a 91–73 win. Following the win, Roy Williams kissed the Smith Center court, causing speculation of possible retirement. Williams later said it was because of the team's 10–1 home record.\nFollowing the season, Williams announced he was retiring after 18 years as head coach of North Carolina and 33 years of coaching.

While the NCAA's current three-division format has been in place since the 1973–74 season, the organization did not sponsor women's sports until the 1981–82 school year; before that time, women's college sports were governed by the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW). The NCAA has officially recorded rebounding statistics since it first sponsored women's basketball. Whereas 3-point field goals were officially instituted by the NCAA for women's play in the 1987–88 season.\nSabrina Ionescu, whose career at Oregon was between 2016 and 2020, also holds a unique NCAA basketball record with 2,562 points, 1,040 rebounds and 1,091 assists; the only NCAA player in any division, whether male or female, to record a 2,000/1,000/1,000. Courtney Paris, who recorded 2,729 points and 2,034 rebounds at Oklahoma between 2005 and 2009, is the only woman with more than 2,000/2,000 and only player overall with more than 2,500/2,000.\nThe only listed player to have played in more than the standard four seasons is Ashley Joens, who played at Iowa State from 2018 to 2023. Joens benefited from a blanket NCAA eligibility waiver that did not count the 2020–21 season, extensively disrupted by COVID-19, against the eligibility of any basketball player."

He went 3–1 with a 1.95 ERA, 0.83 walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) ratio and 46 strikeouts in innings pitched before the season was cut short due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nProfessional career.\nThe Miami Marlins selected Meyer in the first round, with the third overall selection, in the 2020 Major League Baseball draft. He signed with the Marlins for a $6.7 million signing bonus.\nMeyer made his professional debut in 2021 with the Pensacola Blue Wahoos of the Double-A South and was promoted to the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp of the Triple-A East in September. Over 22 starts between the two clubs, Meyer pitched to a 6–4 record, a 2.27 ERA, and 130 strikeouts over 111 innings. Meyer was selected to play in the 2021 All-Star Futures Game. He opened the 2022 season back with Jacksonville. \nOn July 16, 2022, Meyer had his contract selected to the 40-man roster and he was promoted to the major leagues for the first time. In his second MLB start against the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 23, he left the game with elbow discomfort. On August 9, Meyer underwent Tommy John surgery, with a recovery timetable causing him to miss the remainder of the 2022 season and the entire 2023 season.\nMeyer was initially optioned to Triple–A Jacksonville to begin the 2024 season. However, the Marlins later reversed course and included Meyer on their Opening Day roster."

        "text": "The 1913–14 Princeton Tigers men's ice hockey season was the 15th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nWith Hobey Baker in his final season of eligibility, Princeton had a good opportunity to reclaim the intercollegiate championship that had eluded them the year before. They continued the best of three series against both Harvard and Yale with the winner likely to be the best team in the nation. Baker, who had been team captain the year before, stepped to the side to allow fellow senior Wendel Kuhn to serve in that capacity though it was clear that Baker was still the best player on the team. Former team members Clarence Peacock and Cyril Ballin returned to serve as assistant coaches for the team.\nAfter several good practices the team opened their season against St. Paul's School, the alma mater of both Baker and Kuhn, and the speedy Baker demonstrated that he hadn't taken a step back with a double hat-trick in the 8–3 win. Over the holiday break the Tigers played defending Canadian champion Toronto, winning the game 5–2 behind Kuhn's 4-goal game. They then took on the Boston Athletic Association, who had already defeated Harvard, and again won, this time by a score of 4–3. Princeton lost Rolland Peacock to a knee injury in the second match but the pair of goals by Kuhn and Baker were enough to give the Tigers the win.\nAfter the break was over Princeton played Ottawa and the Canadian team proved a difficult match. The Gee-Gees played rough against Baker throughout the game and use a good effort to score three times early. Unfortunately, one of those goals was on their own net so when Baker scored the first goal from a Tiger stick he knotted the game at 2–2. The two teams played an extra session to no effect so a second overtime period was required. Both teams were exceedingly tired by this point but despite the fatigue Ottawa was able to score twice to hand Princeton their first loss of the season. The Tigers took their frustration out on their next opponent, Cornell; after allowing the first goal just 18 seconds into the contest Princeton scored the next nine to win in a convincing fashion. Kuhn netted 5 of the goals while Baker and Kilner each had a pair with the former credited with at least three assists. Their second intercollegiate match came a few days later and, despite a valiant effort by Dartmouth goaltender Donohue, Princeton was victorious. The following game against Army ended up being a strange affair. With Kuhn absent, Baker served as team captain but didn't play the entire game. From the start it was apparent that the Tigers were the better team despite missing some of their normal starters. After building a 4–0 lead in a 15-minute half the game was called after only 5 minutes in the second half on account of darkness but even in that short time Baker was substituted for the first time to give Shenstone a bit of game experience at rover.\nWhen Princeton began the championship series with Harvard they had to do so without two of their starters, Kilner and Grant Peacock. The lack of talent and substitutes harmed Princeton's ability to compete and Harvard took full advantage, winning one of the longest games in college hockey history 2–1. The Tigers' next game came at Yale on the Elis' newly completely steel rink. The Bulldogs jumped out to a 3–1 lead but the speed of Hobey Baker, despite playing on dulled skates, allowed Princeton to the tie the game. The team speed of the Tigers kept them on the attack in the extra session with Kuhn scoring twice to salt the game away. The rematch three days later was nearly the opposite as Princeton jumped out to a three-goal lead less than seven minutes into the game and then slumped badly afterwards. Fortunately for the Tigers the Yale offense wasn't up to the task and could only manage a single goal, allowing Princeton to sweep the series despite Baker receiving the only penalty of his collegiate career, a tripping minor.\nFor the second straight year Princeton entered their rematch with Harvard needing a win to force a third game. Baker was again the star of the game, assisting on Kilner's goal to open the scoring then netting one of his own to tie the match just before the end of the half. Baker's second goal came just past the midway point of the second and put the Tigers ahead for good in a 4–2 win. The final game against Harvard would eventually serve as the championship game and proved to be one of the best performances of the season for Princeton and Baker specifically. While the Tigers star was held without a goal he was instrumental in three of Princeton's tallies and nearly caused a fourth. Kuhn and MacColl each scored twice and the stellar defense provided by Winants and Emmons held Harvard to just a single goal, allowing Princeton to claim the collegiate championship. One week later Princeton made its first trip outside the country when they went to Ottawa to take on the Canadian champion, Ottawa Gee-Gees. The Gee-Gees had given Princeton their first loss of the season and the Tigers were eager to repay them for the favor, and claim an international championship in the process. Both teams proved the measure of one another and an overtime session was required. Just as the first extra period was ending Ottawa managed to find the back of the net and end Princeton's otherwise brilliant season on a sour note.\nHobey Baker led the team in scoring with at least 19 goals and was credited with no less than 13 assists. For his career Baker finished with at minimum 80 goals and 44 assists in 37 games, though it is probable that his true assist total is much higher. Despite that his pace was at least 3 points per game which would place him among the top scorers in the history of college ice hockey.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\nScoring Statistics.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "Big Three (tennis)",
        "text": "The Big Three is a common nickname in tennis for the trio of Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, each considered to be among the greatest players of all time. The trio have dominated men's singles tennis for two decades, collectively winning 66 major singles tournaments; Djokovic leads with an all-time record of 24 titles, followed by Nadal with 22 and Federer with 20. They have been ranked as world No. 1s in singles for a total of 942 weeks (equivalent to 18 years); Djokovic for a record 423 weeks, Federer for 310, and Nadal for 209. One of the three finished the season as the year-end No. 1 player every year from 2004 to 2023, with the exceptions of 2016 and 2022. They collectively occupied the top-three positions of the year-end ATP rankings eight times; in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2014, 2018, and 2019.\nPrior to the adoption of the term Big Three, there was the Big Four, a similar term used from about 2008 to 2017 to describe the larger quartet of Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, and their nearest and most consistent rival, Andy Murray. Although the volume of Murray's achievements would not match the 'Big Three', during those nine years he was in contention on a similar basis for the biggest trophies, reaching the final at all four majors at least once, winning several major and Masters titles, in addition to the ATP Finals and the Olympics, while being the only other player to make it to the top of the ATP rankings (from November 2016 to August 2017) in an 18-year period from 2004 to 2022. The term is occasionally still used when referring to the group. As both a trio and as a quartet, they have been a critical part of what has been labelled a \"golden era\" in men's tennis.\nFederer was the first to come to prominence after winning Wimbledon in 2003, and became the world No. 1 after winning the Australian Open in 2004. Nadal followed in 2005 with a French Open triumph on his first attempt, including a win over Federer, and the duo occupied the top two places of the ATP rankings from July 2005 to August 2009. From 2007, Djokovic and Murray increasingly challenged Federer and Nadal's dominance with consistency. By 2011, Nadal declared that his joint dominance with Federer had ended, following the ascent of Djokovic and later Murray. Djokovic has been a dominant player since the beginning of 2011, gradually approaching or surpassing Federer and Nadal's career achievements. Despite occasional injury breaks by individual members of the Big Three, they have maintained their collective dominance at the majors through to 2023. However, the emergence of new players, commonly referred to as the \"Next Gen\", has tempered their dominance at the ATP Finals and Masters tournaments since 2017.\nThe Big Four regularly held the top four places in the rankings between 2008 and 2013. They were ranked year-end world top four from 2008 to 2012, the longest span of dominance for any quartet of players in tennis history. They held the top-two spots continuously from 25 July 2005 to 14 March 2021, as well as the top ranking from 2 February 2004 to 28 February 2022, meaning that no player outside the Big Four were ranked world No. 1 for 18 years or was in the top 2 for nearly 16 years. All four have reached a career-high ranking of world No. 1: Djokovic has been No. 1 for a record 423 weeks, Federer for 310 weeks, Nadal for 209 weeks, and Murray for 41 weeks. Djokovic was the year-end No. 1 for a record eight years, with Federer and Nadal for five years each, and Murray once.\nAt the Grand Slam tournaments, the trio are the all-time title leaders; Djokovic has won a record 24 majors, Nadal with 22 and Federer 20. They have each completed a career Grand Slam by winning all four majors at least once, with Nadal completing it twice for a double career Grand Slam and Djokovic completing it three times for a triple career Grand Slam. Djokovic has also completed a non-calendar-year Grand Slam, making him the only man in history to hold all four major titles at once across three different surfaces. Nadal and Djokovic have each achieved a Surface Slam by winning majors on hard, clay, and grass courts in a calendar year, making them the only male players in history to do so. The trio have each completed a Channel Slam, with Nadal having achieved it twice. At the Masters tournaments, the trio are also the top-three title leaders; Djokovic leads with a record 40 titles, followed by Nadal with 36, and Federer with 28. Djokovic is the only player to achieve the career Golden Masters by winning all nine active Masters tournaments, a feat he has completed twice. At the ATP Finals, they won 13 titles, with Djokovic winning a record seven titles, and Federer six.\nRepresenting their countries, the Big Four have played vital roles in leading their countries to victory at the Davis Cup, ATP Cup, the Olympics, and the Hopman Cup. At the Davis Cup, Nadal helped Spain to win the title in five editions, Djokovic and Federer helped Serbia (2010) and Switzerland (2014) win their first title in the competition, and Murray helped Great Britain win the title in 2015. At the ATP Cup, Djokovic led Serbia to victory in the inaugural edition in 2020. At the Olympics, the Big Four have won five gold medals, two silver medals, and one bronze medal: Murray won a record two gold medals in singles and a silver in mixed doubles, Nadal won a gold medal in singles (following which he achieved a career Golden Slam) and a gold in doubles, Federer won a silver medal in singles and a gold in doubles, and Djokovic won a bronze medal in singles. Federer is the only member to have won the Hopman Cup for his country, in 2001, 2018, and 2019.\nHistory.\nFederer and Nadal dominance.\n2003 Wimbledon–2004: Federer's ascent to the top of the game.\nThe early 2000s were seen as a time of transition in tennis, with older champions retiring and a few players breaking through at the very top of the game. Roger Federer first played on the ATP Tour aged 17 in 1998, finishing his first full ATP season the following year. By the end of the 2002 season, he was ranked sixth in the world. His breakthrough came in 2003 when he won his first major title at Wimbledon, won the year-end championships, and finished the year as the world No. 2 behind Andy Roddick. Federer then captured three of the four majors in 2004, losing only at the French Open, as well as becoming the world No. 1 on 2 February and maintaining the top position through the end of the year. Federer entered the 2004 Summer Olympics as the heavy favourite, but lost in the second round to Tomáš Berdych.\nRafael Nadal won his first ATP Tour match aged 15 in April 2002, and he defeated Federer in their first meeting at the 2004 Miami Open.\n2005–2007: Federer continues dominance, Nadal dominates clay.\nIn the following three years (2005–2007), Federer dominated the tennis scene except on clay. Between 2005 Wimbledon and 2007 US Open, he captured eight of ten majors with a record of 67–2 in those tournaments (his only two losses in that stretch were delivered by Nadal at the French Open). Federer also maintained the world No. 1 ranking for the entirety of the period.\n2005 was Nadal's breakthrough year, in which he won 24 consecutive matches on clay, including his first French Open title, beating Federer in the semifinals, and he finished the year as the world No. 2. He was dominant on clay, suffering only one loss on the surface (to Federer at the 2007 Hamburg Masters final) between his breakthrough and the end of 2007. He established an 81-match winning streak on clay during this time.\nThe period between 2005 and 2007 was thus entirely dominated by Federer and Nadal. They won 11 consecutive majors between them, meeting in each French Open and Wimbledon final from 2006 to 2008. From 2005 to 2010, they ended each season as the world's top two players.\nNovak Djokovic and Andy Murray were born a week apart, played each other as juniors, and both made their major debuts in 2005. Djokovic made his ATP Tour debut in 2004, while Murray's was in 2005. They both reached the world's top 100 in 2005, and the top 20 in 2006. Djokovic, however, began to excel ahead of Murray in 2007, reaching one major final and two semifinals and beginning to regularly challenge Federer and Nadal. He also won two Masters titles and five overall titles during the season, finishing 2007 as the world No. 3. Murray, who was kept out of the French Open and Wimbledon by injury, ended 2007 ranked 11th.\nBig Four era.\n2008–2010: Federer and Nadal dominance, Djokovic and Murray challenge.\nBetween 2008 and 2010, Djokovic and later Murray attempted to end the duopoly of Federer and Nadal at the summit of tennis. They did not break it but emerged ahead of the rest of the tour.\nAt the 2008 Australian Open, Djokovic defeated Federer in the semifinals, reaching his first Australian Open final and ending Federer's streak of ten consecutive major finals. Djokovic went on to defeat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga (who had eliminated Nadal in the semifinals) to win his first major. Following the win, Djokovic emerged as a clear world No. 3, holding the ranking for the entirety of 2008. Meanwhile, Murray continued to rise in the rankings, reaching his first major quarterfinal at Wimbledon, losing to Nadal. He also won his first two Masters titles.\nNonetheless, Federer–Nadal remained the lead rivalry, as the pair met in the finals of both the French Open and Wimbledon. Nadal won both, with the latter final often described as one of the greatest tennis matches of all time. In August, after winning singles gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and an early loss for Federer at the Cincinnati Masters, Nadal became the world No. 1, ending Federer's record 237 consecutive week streak at the top. At the Olympics, Federer lost in the quarterfinals to James Blake, while Djokovic lost in the semifinals to Nadal, but went on to win the bronze medal. Federer excelled in the men's doubles event and captured the gold medal. At the US Open, all four players reached the semifinals of the same major for the first time. Federer defeated Djokovic in the semifinals, while Murray reached his first major final after upsetting the top-ranked Nadal in four sets. Federer then defeated Murray in the final to win his fifth consecutive US Open title and his 13th major title overall. Following the tournament, Murray entered the top four in the ATP rankings for the first time. All four players qualified for the year-end championships, which Djokovic won for the first time. Despite withdrawing from the event due to injury, Nadal finished the year as year-end No. 1.\nIn 2009, the quartet held the top four places in the rankings for the entire calendar year. This also prompted the first uses of the term 'Big Four' to refer to the players, although results saw Nadal and Federer generally remain clear leaders ahead of Djokovic and Murray, who in turn were regarded as ahead of the rest of the tour. At the Australian Open, Nadal won his first title there in another five-set final, his third consecutive major final victory over Federer, while Murray and Djokovic were eliminated earlier. Nadal continued to dominate in most of the early season, winning three Masters titles. He entered the French Open as the favourite, but was defeated in a massive upset by Robin Söderling in the fourth round. Federer went on to win his first French Open title, defeating Söderling in the final. With the win, he equaled Pete Sampras' then-record of 14 Grand Slam singles titles and completed the Career Grand Slam, having lost to Nadal at each of the previous four editions of the French Open. Federer subsequently surpassed Sampras' record by winning his 15th major title at Wimbledon.\nWith Nadal's injuries, Murray and Djokovic improved in the rankings, with Murray reaching world No. 2 in August and ending the 211-week reign of Federer and Nadal as the top two ranked players. At the US Open, Murray was upset in the fourth round by Marin Čilić, while Djokovic reached his first Grand Slam semifinal of the season and lost in straight sets to Federer. Nadal was defeated by Juan Martín del Potro in the semifinals, and del Potro beat Federer in the final to claim the title. Between 2005 Australian Open and 2014 Australian Open, this was the only major not won by a member of the Big Four. At the end of 2009, Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Murray finished as the top four players for the second consecutive year, with only Nadal and Federer changing positions from 2008. Federer finished the season having reached all four major finals for the third time in his career following 2006 and 2007.\nDuring the 2010 season, the Big Four began to dominate the tour as a group for the first time. They comprised six of the eight Grand Slam finalists and won a combined 16 tournaments (compared to six for the other four competitors at the 2010 ATP Finals). At the start of the year, Federer continued his dominance as the world No. 1 by winning the Australian Open, defeating Murray in the final, but his run of 23 consecutive Grand Slam semifinals came to an end at the French Open when he lost to Robin Söderling in the quarterfinal. He then lost to Tomáš Berdych at Wimbledon, ending his run of seven consecutive Wimbledon finals. Nadal then resumed his domination of the clay-court season, winning all three clay-court Masters events and the French Open, where he defeated Söderling in the final. Nadal also won Wimbledon over Berdych, having missed the previous year's edition due to injury.\nAt the US Open, Djokovic beat Federer in the semifinals to reach his third major final, but lost to Nadal, who went on to complete the Career Grand Slam. With the win, Nadal became the first player to win majors on three different surfaces in a single calendar year, known as the Surface Slam. Each member of the Big Four reached the 2010 ATP Finals semifinals with Federer defeating Nadal in three sets in the final, leading to them achieving their third successive season in the top four positions. Djokovic and Murray were third and fourth respectively, both reaching one Grand Slam final apiece.\n2011–2013: Big Four dominance.\nThe 2011 season was dominated by Novak Djokovic. He won ten titles, including three majors (only the fifth man in the Open Era to do so) and a then-record five Masters titles, enjoyed a 41-match winning streak, and ascended to the world No. 1 position for the first time after defeating Nadal at the Wimbledon final. Djokovic went 12–2 against Nadal, Federer and Murray during the season. His season was described by many experts and former players as one of the best tennis seasons for a singles player seen in history. Pete Sampras described it as \"one of the best achievements in all of sport.\"\nDjokovic's dominance contributed to overall control by the Big Four. They all reached the semifinals at two of the year's Grand Slam events, and between them won every Masters tournament. Nadal was the clear world No. 2 behind Djokovic, winning the French Open and reaching both the Wimbledon and US Open finals (losing both to Djokovic). Nadal ended the season with a 0–6 record against Djokovic, with every encounter between them at a final.\nBy his standards, Federer had a weak season. He failed to win a Grand Slam title for the first time since 2002, losing to Nadal for the fourth time in a French Open final. He dropped to world No. 4 in November, the first time he had been ranked outside the top three since 2002. However, Federer rallied, winning his three final tournaments, including the ATP Finals, which secured an end-of-season ranking of world No. 3. Murray, meanwhile, made the semifinals of all four majors, with a runner-up finish in the Australian Open final to Djokovic. Murray ended the year with two Masters titles for the fourth consecutive year, and five titles in total.\nThe dominance of the Big Four continued and culminated in 2012, because each player won a major this year: Djokovic the Australian Open, Nadal the French Open, Federer Wimbledon and Murray his maiden major title at the US Open. Murray's major win combined with winning the gold medal at the London Olympics at Wimbledon with consecutive victories over Djokovic and Federer – increased Murray's standing as a member of the Big Four: his end-of-season ranking of world No. 3 was his career-best. Djokovic entered the season as the world No. 1 and remained there until July 2012, when he was overtaken by Federer, who reclaimed the top spot for the first time in two years. Federer subsequently overtook Sampras' then-record of 286 weeks as the world No. 1, and extended the record to 302. Federer relinquished his world No. 1 ranking on 5 November to Djokovic, before they met in the final match of the season at the year-end championships where Djokovic won in straight sets and ended his second consecutive season at No. 1. Djokovic was the only player to reach the semifinals at all majors, defeating Nadal in the final of the Australian Open (in what is considered to be one of the greatest tennis matches of all time), and was the runner-up at both Roland Garros and the US Open. He and Federer each won three Masters titles. Nadal, meanwhile, had his season curtailed by an injury. Having won two clay-court Masters titles and Roland Garros, he was eliminated in the second round at Wimbledon – his earliest defeat at a Grand Slam tournament since 2005. He did not compete for the rest of the season, but still ended the year as world No. 4.\nThe 2013 season continued similarly, with Djokovic, Federer and Murray occupying three of the four semifinal slots at the Australian Open, with Nadal still suffering from an injury. Murray beat Federer in a five-set semifinal match, meaning all four members of the Big Four had beaten each other at least once at a major, but he lost to Djokovic in the final. Nadal returned for the clay-court season, winning five events before becoming the only man to win a major eight times by taking the French Open, defeating Djokovic in an epic semifinal clash en route. However, Djokovic ended Nadal's record eight-year winning streak at the Monte-Carlo Masters. Nadal and Federer lost early at Wimbledon, thus ending Federer's record streak of 36 consecutive major quarterfinals. Murray defeated Djokovic in the final, becoming the first Briton to win the men's singles title in 77 years. Nadal dominated the US Open series, winning the Canada Masters, Cincinnati Masters, and US Open, defeating Djokovic in the final of the latter.\nNadal and Djokovic dominated the 2013 season. Nadal won two Majors and five Masters events, and was runner-up at the ATP Finals. Nadal made the final at all eight clay-court tournaments he played, winning six; he also made the semifinals at all eight of his hard-court tournaments, winning four titles. Djokovic won one major, reached two major finals and a semifinal, and finished the year on a 22-match winning streak after taking the ATP Finals beating Nadal in the final. A back injury ended Murray's season prematurely, but he finished fourth in the rankings and was the only player besides Nadal and Djokovic to win a Grand Slam event or Masters title (at Wimbledon and Miami respectively). Federer suffered his worst season in over a decade. He reached just one major semifinal at the Australian Open, failed to win a single Masters, and finished the year sixth in the rankings with one title to his name; he also suffered from a recurring back injury throughout the season.\n2014: Dominance in majors halted.\nAs 2013 came to a close, Federer's fall in the rankings prompted many sources to debate whether the dominance of the Big Four had ended. This debate intensified after the Australian Open, which saw Stan Wawrinka defeat Djokovic in the quarterfinal and Nadal in the final to win his first Slam title, marking just the second time since 2005 and the first since 2009 that a player outside the Big Four had won a major title. Murray and Federer fell to sixth and eighth in the rankings respectively, and after the tournament, several players expressed the opinion that they were now capable of challenging the Big Four. However, the first two Masters titles of the year in Indian Wells and Miami only had Big Four finalists, with Djokovic winning his third and fourth consecutive Masters titles with victories over Federer and Nadal respectively. Nadal struggled early in the clay season at his traditional favorite tournaments of Monte-Carlo and Barcelona. A third loss, to Djokovic in the final of the Rome Masters, was the first time Nadal had lost more than two matches on clay in a season for a decade. He did, however, win the Madrid Masters after Nishikori injured his back whilst leading Nadal 6–2, 4–3 in that final. Nadal went on to defend his French Open title, defeating Murray in the semifinal and Djokovic in the final.\nFollowing his back surgery at the end of 2013, Murray struggled to return to form in the first half of the year, reaching only two semifinals and losing to Grigor Dimitrov in straight sets in the quarterfinals while attempting to defend his Wimbledon title, a defeat which saw him fall to No. 10 in the world rankings. This, and Nadal's loss to Nick Kyrgios in the fourth round, his third consecutive early-round loss at Wimbledon, led former players and experts, including Jimmy Connors, to express the opinion that the \"aura\" around the Big Four had faded. Milos Raonic, who reached the semifinals at Wimbledon, suggested a \"human side\" was visible in the Big Four, which was giving players belief when facing them. However, Djokovic defeated Dimitrov and Federer beat Raonic to make it an all-Big Four final, the 24th they had contested. Djokovic defeated Federer in five sets to claim his second Wimbledon title, a result that left Djokovic, Nadal and Federer occupying the top three places in the rankings.\nFederer continued his return to form reaching the finals of Toronto and winning his first Masters title since 2012 in Cincinnati. Later, he also won the Shanghai Masters, and returned to No. 2 in the rankings, overtaking Nadal, whose season had been curtailed by a wrist injury. The US Open 2014 saw the Big Four's collective grip on the major titles slip still further, however, as Kei Nishikori and Marin Čilić beat Djokovic and Federer in the semifinals respectively to contest the first Slam final featuring none of the Big Four since the 2005 French Open, and the first time since 2003 that multiple first-time Grand Slam tournament winners have been crowned in a single season. Following the tournament, Murray dropped to 11th in the rankings, his first time outside the top ten since 2008. The tournament further signalled the decline of the Big Four's dominance. The Big Four bounced back towards the end of the year, with Federer winning the Shanghai Masters, and Djokovic winning the Paris Masters. Murray managed to return to form, winning three titles in Shenzhen, Vienna and Valencia, allowing him to return to the top ten in the rankings and qualify for the ATP Finals, but he bowed out at the group stages following a defeat by Federer, in which he won just a single game. Indeed, throughout the year, Murray failed to register a single victory against another member of the Big Four in nine meetings.\nAt the ATP Finals, Djokovic won the event after Federer withdrew before the final citing injury following a semifinal win over Wawrinka. Federer recovered to win the Davis Cup as part of the Switzerland team for his, and the country's, first triumph in the competition, leading many people to say that his tennis career was now complete. Collectively, the Big Four won 19 titles in 2014, but two Grand Slam titles and two Masters titles went to other players. In the end-of-year rankings, Djokovic, Federer and Nadal held the top three spots, with Murray in sixth.\n2015–2016: Djokovic domination, Murray and Federer challenge.\nFollowing Murray's strong end to 2014 and reaching the final of the 2015 Australian Open, he moved into the top four in the world rankings for the first time in over a year, meaning that the Big Four held the top four places in the rankings for the first time since early 2013, slowing the idea of the regression of the quartet. Djokovic won the Australian Open, as well as the first three Masters titles of the year in Indian Wells, Miami and Monte-Carlo. In Madrid, Murray defeated Nadal in straight sets. This was also the first time he had beaten another member of the Big Four since Wimbledon 2013, ending a streak of 12 losses against the other members. The defeat saw Nadal slip to seventh in the rankings, his first time outside the top five in more than a decade. Djokovic defeated Federer in the Rome final. Nadal suffered his worst European clay-court season in a decade, failing to win a single title and appearing in just one final, whereas Djokovic and Murray entered the French Open unbeaten on clay. Djokovic defeated Nadal for the first time at the French Open in a straight-sets quarterfinal. This was only Nadal's second defeat at the French Open, seeing him drop to No. 10 in the rankings. Djokovic emerged victorious over Murray in a five-set match that was spread over two days but lost to Wawrinka in the final in four sets.\nFederer beat Murray in straight sets in the semifinals of Wimbledon. Djokovic claimed the other spot in the final, to set up a rematch of the previous year's final, and defeated Federer in four sets to win his second major of the year, denying Federer a record eighth Wimbledon title for the second year in a row. Murray and Federer shared the two North American hard-court Masters titles, at Montreal and Cincinnati respectively, with Djokovic being the losing finalist on both occasions. The US Open final was contested by Djokovic and Federer. Djokovic won in four sets, giving him a third Grand Slam title of the season.\nDjokovic then continued to dominate throughout the remainder of the year, winning in Beijing, Shanghai, Paris and at the ATP Finals. Overall, Djokovic's 2015 season was one of the greatest in the history of the game, with him winning a record 10 Big Titles, including three majors for the second time in his career, a record six Masters titles and the year-end championships. He also became the only man in the Open Era besides Rod Laver and Federer to play all four major finals in the same year. He was dominant even against his fellow Big Four rivals, going 15–4 against them throughout the year and he had a record 31 victories against the top 10 in the season. Federer was the most competitive against Djokovic, winning three of their eight matches, which made up half of Djokovic's total defeats in 2015. Nadal and Murray both struggled against the Serb, with Nadal losing all four of his encounters in straight sets, and Murray winning only one of his seven encounters, in Montreal. However, Murray did lead Great Britain to Davis Cup victory in 2015, winning all eight singles rubbers and becoming the final member of the quartet to win the Davis Cup. Murray did finish at his career-highest year-end ranking of two even if he won fewer titles, reached fewer finals and had less success versus Djokovic when compared with Federer in the number three ranking.\nIn 2016, Djokovic collected his sixth Australian Open title in a straight-sets victory over Murray. He followed up this solid run of form with a record-setting fifth Indian Wells Masters and record-equaling sixth Miami Masters titles. Nadal won in Monte Carlo for a record ninth time. Murray and Djokovic played the Masters finals of Madrid and Rome and split the titles. At the 2016 French Open, Murray reached his first final at Roland Garros to complete his set of Grand Slam singles finals, but Djokovic beat him in the final to become the third Big Four member after Federer and Nadal to complete a Career Grand Slam (Djokovic would complete it two more times in the following years). By winning Roland Garros, Djokovic set a ranking points record of 16,950 and became the first player since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four Grand Slam titles at the same time.\nAt Wimbledon, Murray beat Raonic in straight sets in the final to win his second Wimbledon title, and third major title overall. Murray's victory marked the first time since the 2010 French Open that a member of the Big Four had won a Grand Slam singles title without having to defeat one of the other three members. Federer withdrew from the remainder of the 2016 season due to a knee injury, missing the Olympics and US Open.\nAt the Olympics, Djokovic was knocked out of the men's singles in the opening round by Juan Martín del Potro, in a repeat of the bronze medal match from four years earlier. Del Potro went on to defeat Nadal in an epic semifinal to set up a final meeting with Murray. Murray ultimately won the final in four sets, becoming the first male player to win the singles gold medal twice. Nadal lost the bronze medal match to Kei Nishikori but won gold in the men's doubles event. Djokovic won Toronto with Murray losing in the final of Cincinnati. At the US Open, Djokovic reached the final but lost to Stan Wawrinka in four sets.\nMurray dominated the rest of the year. He won titles in Beijing, Shanghai, Vienna and Paris. As a result, upon reaching the Paris final, Murray gained the number-one ranking, ending Djokovic's 122 consecutive weeks at the top. This meant that all of the Big Four had reached world number one at some point. Following an early loss at Shanghai, Nadal announced that he would skip the remainder of the 2016 season to recover fully from the wrist injury that troubled him earlier in the year. Thus, for the first time since 2001, neither Nadal nor Federer would be present at the year-end championships. At the ATP Finals, Murray beat Djokovic 6–3, 6–4, claiming the title and the No. 1 spot at the end of the year and ending 2016 on a 24-match winning streak, the longest of his career. He became the second player after Andre Agassi to win a Grand Slam singles tournament, ATP Finals, Olympic and Masters titles, and the first to do so in the same calendar year. 2016 marked the first year since 2003 that neither Federer, Nadal or Djokovic finished the year as world number 1. Despite his struggles with form throughout the second half of the year, Djokovic still ended 2016 as world number two. Having suffered from injury-plagued seasons, Nadal and Federer ended the year at number nine and 16 respectively. For Nadal, it was his lowest end-of-year ranking since 2004, while Federer's fall in the rankings meant that November 2016 marked his first time outside the top ten since October 2002.\nBig Three solidified.\n2017–2018 French Open: Federer and Nadal return, Djokovic and Murray sidelined.\nAt the Australian Open, Djokovic and Murray both suffered defeats prior the quarterfinals. Nadal and Federer, meanwhile, both progressed to the final after each won five-set semifinals. In the highly anticipated final, Federer triumphed over Nadal in five sets, winning his 18th Grand Slam title and his first since Wimbledon 2012. Federer went on to win a record-equaling fifth Indian Wells title, defeating Nadal in the fourth round. Federer and Nadal once again met in the Miami Open final, where Federer again won.\nAs the 2017 clay court swing commenced, Federer skipped the entire clay season to rest and focus on the grass and hard-court seasons. Nadal claimed the Monte-Carlo Masters title, which saw him become the first man to win a single tournament ten times and simultaneously establish a new record for the most clay-court titles at 50, surpassing Guillermo Vilas' 49. Nadal also won in Madrid, while Djokovic fell to Alexander Zverev in the Rome final. Nadal breezed through to the French Open title, defeating Wawrinka in the final and not dropping a set at the tournament for the third time in his career. This marked Nadal's first major title since the 2014 French Open. Following the win, Nadal returned to world No. 2, while Djokovic, who lost in the quarterfinals, fell to world No. 4, his lowest ranking since October 2009 and his first time outside the top two of the rankings since March 2011.\nAt Wimbledon, the quartet formed the top four seeds at a major for the first time since 2014. Nadal, Murray and Djokovic all lost before the semifinals. Federer, however, won the title without dropping a set by beating Marin Čilić in the final. Federer's run marked a record-breaking eleventh Wimbledon final and eighth title. This led to the \"Big Four\" being the ATP top four again. Djokovic announced in July that he would skip the rest of the 2017 season to recover from an elbow injury, and Murray did not play another tournament in 2017 as well due to a hip injury. At Montreal, Federer reached the final but sustained a severe back injury there, which took him out of contention for the US Open and the No. 1 ranking. Although Nadal did not reach the semifinals of either North American Masters event, he returned to world No. 1 over the inactive Murray. Nadal then defeated Kevin Anderson in the US Open final. This was the fourth time that Nadal and Federer had won all four majors in the same year, following their sweeps in 2006, 2007, and 2010. Additionally, on 11 September 2017, Nadal and Federer were ranked No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, the first time since 20 March 2011 that they held the top two rankings spots. Federer then returned to Shanghai and won his second title there, defeating Nadal in the final. This was his fourth win out of four meetings with Nadal in 2017, as well as his fifth consecutive.\nIn 2017, Nadal had his best year since 2013, winning two majors and four other titles. Federer finished the year at world No. 2 behind Nadal and overall had his best year since 2007, with his highest number of titles won since that year, winning two majors for the first time since 2009, and ending the year with a winning percentage of 91%, his highest since 2006. Djokovic and Murray both finished with their lowest year-end rankings since 2006, at No. 12 and 16 respectively.\nAt the start of 2018, Murray underwent hip surgery for the injury that had sidelined him since the previous summer. Djokovic and Nadal lost early at the Australian Open. Federer, however, went on to defend his title in a five-set final against Marin Čilić, thus equaling Djokovic and Roy Emerson's then-record of six Australian Open titles, and becoming the first man to win 20 major titles. Soon after, by reaching the semifinals in Rotterdam, Federer overtook returned to world No. 1. In doing so, he became the oldest-ever player to top the ATP rankings (since 1973).\nFederer reached the final of Indian Wells, but lost to Juan Martín del Potro. Federer's early loss in Miami resulted in the loss of the No. 1 ranking with Nadal overtaking him by 100 points. Federer announced that he would again skip the entire clay-court season. Nadal won his eleventh title in Monte Carlo, then claimed an 11th Barcelona title, winning both without dropping a set. Nadal lost to Dominic Thiem in Madrid quarterfinals but came back the following week to win the title in Rome.\nFollowing Djokovic's early exit from the Australian Open, he underwent surgery for the wrist injury that had been causing him issues for the previous year. He returned to the tour at Indian Wells and struggled much with form, failing to reach the quarterfinals of any of his first five tournaments after surgery. He showed promise by reaching the semifinals of Rome, losing to Nadal in two tight sets. He reached the quarterfinals of the French Open, but lost to unseeded Marco Cecchinato. Nadal went on to win the tournament, defeating Dominic Thiem in the final to claim a record-extending 11th French Open title and his 17th major overall. Federer returned to the tour for Stuttgart and won the title there, which saw him return to the No. 1 ranking for a 310th week.\n2018 Wimbledon–2020 Australian Open: Djokovic returns, dominates with Nadal.\nAt 2018 Wimbledon, Federer lost to Kevin Anderson in the quarterfinals despite holding a two-sets-to-love lead and holding a match point in the third set, having suffered a hand injury at the start of the grass season. Meanwhile, Nadal as world No. 1 and Djokovic as world No. 22 made the semifinals where Djokovic defeated Nadal in a five-set thriller to reach his first major final in nearly two years. He then defeated Anderson in the final to win his fourth Wimbledon title and 13th major title overall.\nAt the 2018 US Open series, Nadal won his fourth title at the Canadian Open which was a then-record 33rd Masters title. A week later, Djokovic beat Federer in Cincinnati to win his first Cincinnati Masters title, becoming the first and only player so far to complete the Career Golden Masters. Djokovic advanced to his eleventh US Open semifinal in as many appearances, and proceeded to win his third US Open title and 14th major title overall. With the win, Djokovic returned to the top 3 in the world rankings for the first time since the 2017 French Open.\nDjokovic then won his 4th Shanghai title without dropping a set, which improved his ranking to world No. 2. Nadal withdrew before his first match at the Paris Masters, thus yielding the No. 1 ranking to Djokovic. Djokovic and Federer met in the semifinals, where Djokovic won in three hours. Djokovic was defeated by Karen Khachanov in the final. Nadal withdrew from the ATP Finals to undergo surgery for an ankle injury. Federer and Djokovic were both defeated at the ATP Finals by Alexander Zverev in the semifinals and final, respectively. The year ended with Djokovic, Nadal and Federer occupying the top-three positions in the rankings.\nIn the 2019 Australian Open, Federer was upset in the fourth round by 20-year-old Stefanos Tsitsipas in a tight four-setter. In the final, Djokovic defeated Nadal in straight sets to claim a record-winning seventh Australian Open title and increased his major tally to 15. In the week following the Australian Open, Murray underwent another hip surgery.\nFederer rebounded from his early loss at the Australian Open by winning his 100th title in Dubai. He followed this with a runner-up finish at Indian Wells and a title in Miami.\nAfter withdrawing from Indian Wells due to injury, Nadal initially struggled upon returning for the clay-court season, losing in the semifinals at Monte Carlo, Barcelona and Madrid. However, he returned to form in Rome, defeating Djokovic in the final to win his ninth crown at the event. At the French Open, Federer returned to play at the tournament for the first time since 2015, reaching the semifinals where he was defeated by Nadal in straight sets. Djokovic also reached the semifinals without losing a set, but was beaten in five sets by Dominic Thiem in a match that was spread over two days due to rain. In the final, Nadal prevailed over Thiem for a second consecutive year, winning the tournament for a record-extending 12th time. The win brought Nadal to 18 major titles, just two behind Federer's record of 20. Federer, meanwhile, won his tenth title in Halle, making him the only player in the Open Era besides Nadal to win ten titles at the same event.\nIn Wimbledon, Nadal and Federer again met in the semifinals, their first meeting at Wimbledon since the 2008 final. Federer defeated Nadal in four sets to reach the final, where he faced Djokovic. There, Djokovic defeated Federer in the longest Wimbledon final in history. It was Djokovic's 16th major title, only trailing Federer's 20 and Nadal's 18.\nNadal returned in Montreal where he defended his title. Following his victory, he decided not to play in Cincinnati once again. Murray, meanwhile, continued his comeback to tennis through doubles, however, he returned to singles in Cincinnati, where he lost in the first round to Richard Gasquet in straight sets. There, Federer was upset in the third round by qualifier Andrey Rublev, and Djokovic was upset in the semifinals by the eventual champion Daniil Medvedev.\nAt the US Open, Djokovic retired against Stan Wawrinka in the fourth round due to a shoulder injury, and Federer was upset by Grigor Dimitrov in the quarterfinals. Nadal only dropped one set en route to his fifth US Open final, where he met Daniil Medvedev. Despite Nadal going up two sets to love, Medvedev responded furiously and claimed the next two sets. Nadal then defeated Medvedev 6–4 in the fifth set, claiming his fourth US Open title and 19th major title overall, one behind Federer's record.\nNadal ended 2019 as the world No. 1 for the fifth time, despite not reaching the semifinals of ATP Finals. In the 2019 Davis Cup, Spain won its sixth title (its first since 2011), defeating Canada in the final 2–0. Nadal received the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award for his performance in the tournament after he won all eight matches in which he participated. This was Nadal's fifth Davis Cup title.\nAt the 2020 Australian Open, Nadal lost to Dominic Thiem in the quarterfinals, while Djokovic defeated Federer in the semifinals. Djokovic then won his eighth Australian Open title and his 17th major overall by a narrow victory over Thiem in the final.\n2020–2021: Disrupted seasons, Nadal and Djokovic tie Federer's major record.\nThe 2020 season was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Four of the five Masters tournaments typically held between the Australian and the French Open were cancelled, with the Italian Open the only one to be postponed. The French Open itself was postponed to late September, while Wimbledon was cancelled. The first Masters to be held after the resumption of the tour was the Cincinnati Masters, where Djokovic emerged victorious to complete the double Career Golden Masters.\nNadal opted to skip the US Open, citing concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic, while Federer withdrew due to a knee injury. Djokovic was disqualified from the tournament during his fourth-round match against Pablo Carreño-Busta after inadvertently striking a ball at a line judge after conceding a break. The title was won by Dominic Thiem, who became the first player outside the Big Three to win a major since Stan Wawrinka in 2016. Djokovic rebounded to win a record 36th Masters title in the Italian Open two weeks later. Federer did not enter the rescheduled French Open, still sidelined by his knee injury. Nadal successfully defended his title over Djokovic in a straight-sets final. With the win, Nadal equaled Federer's all-time record of 20 major singles titles and extended his own record to 13 titles at the same major tournament.\nFederer did not compete in the 2021 Australian Open in order to recover from surgery. There, Nadal was upset by Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarterfinals despite taking a two-sets-to-love lead, while Djokovic successfully defended his title by beating Daniil Medvedev in straight sets. The win marked his ninth Australian Open title and 18th major title overall, putting him two titles away from tying Federer and Nadal.\nNadal achieved his 36th Masters victory by defeating Djokovic in the Italian Open final. At the French Open, Federer withdrew after his third round victory in order not to jeopardize his recovery from a knee injury, while Nadal's bid at winning a record 21st major ended when he lost to Djokovic in an epic semifinal encounter. Despite being down two sets to love in the final against Stefanos Tsitsipas, Djokovic rallied to win the title in five sets. With the victory, Djokovic won his second French Open title and 19th major singles title overall, and became the third man after Roy Emerson and Rod Laver to have won each of the four majors at least twice, and the first to do so in the Open Era. Djokovic was then only one title away from tying Federer and Nadal for the most men's singles majors of all time.\nNadal withdrew from Wimbledon due to scheduling reasons. Federer was defeated in the quarterfinals by Hubert Hurkacz. Djokovic won the title and his 20th major against Matteo Berrettini, thereby equaling both Federer and Nadal's all-time tally. The victory made him the first man to win the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon titles in the same calendar year since Rod Laver in 1969, and the second player to win majors on three different surfaces in a calendar year, after Nadal in 2010.\nDjokovic had hoped to emulate Steffi Graf's 1988 Golden Slam in men's tennis by winning the singles Olympic gold and the US Open. However, he lost in the semifinals of Tokyo Olympics to Alexander Zverev, despite being up a set and a break, and subsequently lost the bronze medal match to Pablo Carreño Busta.\nAt the US Open, Federer pulled out of the tournament due to his need for further knee surgery, while Nadal also withdrew due to a nagging foot injury. Djokovic lost in the final to Daniil Medvedev, preventing him from winning a record 21 majors and achieving a Grand Slam, which would have been the first in men's tennis since Rod Laver in 1969. Medvedev thus became the ninth player outside the Big Three to win a major since Federer's first win at 2003 Wimbledon.\nAt the Paris Masters, Djokovic defeated Medvedev in the final to win his sixth Paris Masters title and surpass Nadal for the record of most Masters titles at 37. By reaching the final, Djokovic also clinched the year-end No. 1 ranking for the seventh time, breaking Pete Sampras' all-time record.\n2022–23: Federer retires, Nadal and Djokovic break the major titles record, Djokovic breaks more records.\nDjokovic was unable to compete at the Australian Open for being unvaccinated against COVID-19. Despite multiple appeals for exemption, he was denied a visa to enter the country, which prevented him from defending his title. Federer was unable to compete due to a persistent knee injury while Nadal returned to compete, after a lengthy six-month injury hiatus and a positive COVID-19 result. Despite playing with low expectations, Nadal progressed to the quarterfinals, where he defeated Denis Shapovalov, and Matteo Berrettini in the semifinals. In the 5-hour 24-minute final, he defeated Daniil Medvedev, after coming back from a two-set deficit, to win his record-breaking 21st major and establish a new all-time record for the most men's majors singles titles. He became the fourth man in history to complete the double Career Grand Slam in singles, and the second after Djokovic in the Open Era.\nIn February 2022, Medvedev became the world No. 1-ranked player, following Djokovic's loss in the quarterfinals of the Dubai Championships, thus ending the Big Four's streak of 921 weeks at the top of the ATP rankings which began on 2 February 2004 when Federer overtook Andy Roddick. At the French Open, Federer did not participate while Nadal and Djokovic progressed to a quarterfinal encounter, their record 59th meeting, with Nadal emerging victorious in four sets. Nadal went to contest his 30th major final against Casper Ruud, winning a record-extending 14th French Open title and 22nd major overall. He extended the all-time record for the most men's singles titles and became the third man after Mats Wilander (1982 French Open) and Federer (2017 Australian Open) to defeat four Top-10 players en route to a major title.\nThe 2022 Wimbledon Championships marked the event's first edition since 1998 in which Federer did not compete. Nadal returned to Wimbledon for the first time in three years; however he incurred an abdominal injury during the tournament. He progressed to the quarterfinals to face Taylor Fritz, defeating him in a five-set match that further aggravated his injury. He then withdrew from the tournament before his semifinal encounter against Nick Kyrgios, the latter of whom then advanced to his first major final. Djokovic successfully defended his title by defeating Kyrgios in four sets in the final to win his 21st major title, thereby passing Federer and placing him one behind Nadal. He tied Pete Sampras for the second-most Wimbledon men's singles titles at 7, one behind Federer's all-time record of 8 titles.\nAt the 2022 US Open, Djokovic withdrew from another major for being a foreigner who was unvaccinated against COVID-19, while Federer did not compete due to injuries. Nadal's attempt to win his 23rd major title was thwarted by an upset in the fourth round by Frances Tiafoe. Medvedev's later elimination guaranteed a new champion in Carlos Alcaraz, making it the 13th time that a major featured a new champion since Federer's first Wimbledon title in 2003, and the third consecutive year that the US Open featured a new champion. Djokovic won his 6th ATP Finals by winning the 2022 ATP Finals – Singles, thereby tying Federer's record. At the 2022 Laver Cup, having struggled with a recurring knee injury for the past several years, Federer retired from professional tennis, thus ending the age of the Big Three. He played his last match on Team Europe in doubles partnering Nadal, on a team that also included Djokovic and Murray, the last professional-level tournament featuring the Big Four together.\nAt the 2023 Australian Open, Djokovic returned to Melbourne and won a record-extending 10th Australian Open title, matching Nadal's record of 22 major titles and joining him in the ownership of double-digit titles at a single major. Nadal, on the other hand, was upset in the second round, partially due to a hip injury sustained during the match. That injury would later prevent him from participating the 2023 French Open and the rest of his 2023 season, making it the first time he did not compete there since his debut in 2005. Nadal would later claim that 2024 would probably be his last year on the tour. Meanwhile, Djokovic reached the tournament's final by defeating world No. 1 Alcaraz in the semifinals. He then won in the final to claim his 23rd major title, thereby breaking his tie with Nadal for the most major titles in men's singles and becoming the only man in history to achieve the triple Career Grand Slam.\nAt the 2023 Wimbledon, Djokovic reached a record-extending 35th major final as the favorite for the title, but lost to Alcaraz in five stunning sets in a match lasting almost five hours. The victory made Alcaraz the first non-Big Four player to win Wimbledon since 2002 and marked Djokovic's first loss on Wimbledon's Centre Court in a decade, since losing the 2013 final to Murray.\nDjokovic then defeated Alcaraz in another epic match at the Cincinnati Masters, in the longest best-of-three-sets final in ATP Tour history. At the 2023 US Open, Djokovic beat Daniil Medvedev in straight sets to win his record-extending 24th major title and equal the record for most singles majors in the history of the sport. By reaching the semifinals of the US Open, he set the record for most semifinals' appearances in Grand Slam's among male tennis players with his 47th, surpassing Federer's 46. By reaching the US Open final, he became the second man after Federer to reach all major finals in a year three times, and also became the first man to win at least three slams in the same year four times. He also retained the number 1 ranking after winning his first round match in the US Open.\nDjokovic continued his winning streak by claiming his seventh Paris Masters title and his 40th Masters title overall. By winning his first round-robin match in the ATP Finals, Djokovic secured the year-end No. 1 for the eighth year, thereby extending that record. This victory also allowed him to become the first player in tennis history to be ranked No. 1 for at least 400 weeks. Despite his winning streak ending after losing to Jannik Sinner in his second Round Robin match, he went on to defend his title by defeating Sinner in the finals, thereby winning a record seventh ATP Finals.\n2024: Djokovic challenged by the Next Generation. Nadal's potential last year.\nNadal makes his return in the Brisbane International, making this his first tournament on the tour since the 2023 Australian Open. He loses in the quarterfinals to Jordan Thompson. However, he suffers a tear in a muscle during his quarterfinals match, which leads to him pulling out of the 2024 Australian Open.\nDjokovic enters the Australian Open with the goals to win an 11th title in the tournament and a 25th overall Grand Slam title. He advances to the semifinals, while in the process, tying Federer's record of most Grand Slam quarterfinals appearances at 58. In the semifinals, however, Djokovic's goals are thwarted by Sinner, who defeats him in four sets. Sinner gave Djokovic his first loss in the tournament since 2018 and ended his 33 consecutive wins in the tournament. Djokovic's defeat guaranteed that a new champion would be crowned in the tournament for the first time since 2014, and that the finals of the tournament would not feature at least one of Djokovic, Nadal and Federer for the first time since 2005. Sinner goes on to become the 10th player outside the Big three and 9th player outside the Big four to win a Slam since Federer's first title in the 2003 Wimbledon by defeating Medvedev in the finals to claim his first ever Slam title.\nCareer statistics.\nGrand Slam tournaments.\nDjokovic, Nadal and Federer are the top three all-time men's leaders in Grand Slam singles titles won, winning a record 24, 22 and 20 respectively. All three have completed the Career Grand Slam, Djokovic achieved it three times, Nadal twice and Federer once. They are as well the players with the most finals appearances, Djokovic has reached a record 36 finals, Federer 31 finals, and Nadal 30 finals.\nThey are the only three men in history to win at least eight titles at a single Grand Slam tournament: Nadal with 14 French Open titles, Djokovic with 10 Australian Open titles, and Federer with 8 Wimbledon titles, all of which are all-time title records in their respective tournaments.\nATP Masters tournaments.\nSimilarly, ATP Masters events have been dominated by the Big Three. Djokovic leads with a record 40 titles including a double career Golden Masters, Nadal with 36 and Federer with 28. Each one of them made at least 50 finals at the Masters events, Djokovic with a record 58 finals, Nadal with 53 and Federer with 50.\nBig Titles.\n\"\"\nOther feats: Djokovic achieved a non-calendar Grand Slam, Nadal achieved a career Golden Slam, and both achieved a Surface Slam.\nATP rankings.\nThe Big Three monopolized the top spot in the ATP singles rankings 942 weeks (equivalent to 18 years). Djokovic has been ranked No. 1 for a record 423 weeks, Federer for 310 weeks, and Nadal for 209 weeks. Each player has occupied the year-end top position at least five times, with Djokovic holding the record with eight year-end No. 1 finishes.\nHead-to-head matchups.\nThe respective rivalries between the Big Three are considered to be some of the greatest tennis rivalries of all time, and are the three most prolific men's rivalries of the Open Era. Amongst the three of them they have played 149 matches against each other, 49 of which were at Grand Slam events. They contested in 71 finals, including 23 Grand Slam finals, more than any other trio in tennis history. Currently, Djokovic leads his head-to-head record against both Federer and Nadal. Federer has delivered the most bagels against the other two with four, while receiving only one.\nResults by court surface.\nNadal is dominant on clay, particularly at the French Open, where he has won all six matches against Federer and eight of ten against Djokovic.\nGrand Slam title race.\nThe Big Three have been competing to win the most Grand Slam men's singles titles of all time. Federer first led the trio by winning his first Grand Slam singles title at 2003 Wimbledon. He broke Pete Sampras's all-time record 14 Grand Slam titles at 2009 Wimbledon. Following the 2010 Australian Open, Federer had 16 titles, Nadal 6, and Djokovic 1, the peak of Federer's lead over Nadal and Djokovic. After winning the 2016 French Open, Djokovic came to within 2 titles of Nadal (14 vs. 12), but over the next two years, Nadal and Federer extended their lead over Djokovic again; following the 2018 French Open, Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic had 20, 17, and 12 titles, respectively. During the 2010s, Federer's lead gradually shrank, culminating in Nadal tying Federer's record 20 titles with his win at the 2020 French Open. Subsequently, Djokovic's three victories in 2021 brought him on an equal footing with Federer and Nadal, when for the only time all three players had an equal number of titles. At the 2022 Australian Open, Nadal surpassed both Federer and Djokovic by claiming the title, and went on to claim his 22nd Grand Slam trophy at the 2022 French Open. Djokovic subsequently won the 2022 Wimbledon, the 2023 Australian Open, and the 2023 French Open, surpassing Federer and Nadal and setting the all-time record at 23 Grand Slam titles. Djokovic then claimed the 2023 US Open for a record-extending 24th Grand Slam title. Federer retired on 23 September 2022 with 20 Grand Slam titles.\nNational and international representation.\nsee also ITF team competitions: Olympics, Davis Cup, Hopman Cup and\nATP team competitions: Laver Cup, ATP Cup, United Cup\nLegacy and recognition.\nCurrent and former professionals.\nFellow top players, including David Ferrer, Tomáš Berdych, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Stan Wawrinka and Andy Roddick have all spoken about the dominance of the Big Three (and Murray until 2017) and the challenge they have faced in matching them. Many former top professionals have also spoken about the topic, including Björn Borg, Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras and Goran Ivanišević.\nDavid Ferrer declared in 2013:\nMedia.\nSince 2010, when the Big Four increasingly began to dominate the tour as a group, many articles and reports have concentrated mainly on the members of the Big Four and their chances in upcoming tournaments, with smaller sections devoted to all other players.\nThe presence of the Big Four is generally seen to have had a positive impact on tennis, making the sport more exciting and in turn attracting more attention. However, with all four members being European, this may have had a potentially negative effect on tennis popularity in North America compared to previous decades, when Americans were regularly at the top of men's tennis. It has also been argued that the dominance of the Big Four has made the game predictable or even boring.\nAlternative concepts and proposals.\n'Big Four'.\nEven initially, some tennis commentators, including Murray himself, spoke of a \"Big Three\" or \"Trivalry\", due to Murray's lesser achievements than the Big Three. In 2014, statistician Nate Silver labelled the group the 'Big Three and a Half'. Murray's overall record against the Big Three is 29–56 (as of year end 2021). However, Murray features in the top ten on a number of Open Era records, including in quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals reached at the Majors, and is to date the only person in history to have won two gold medals in singles at the Olympic Games, and only the second player in the Open Era (after Andre Agassi), to have won a Grand Slam singles event, an ATP Finals, an ATP Masters, and an Olympic singles gold, as well as reach world No. 1 in the ATP rankings. He reached world No. 1 after the Big Three reached it, though he had by that time spent 76 weeks as No. 2; further, he first reached No. 2 in August 2009, ending the four-year Federer–Nadal stranglehold on the top two in the process, six months before Djokovic did for the first time (in February 2010).\nMurray's three Majors, two Olympic Games victories, ATP Finals, Masters titles and his success in reaching the world no. 1 ranking, all since 2012, saw him listed more comfortably alongside the other three members during the mid-2010s. His rise to reach the world No. 1 ranking in November 2016 and keep it to finish the year at the top position further helped arguments about him belonging in a \"Big Four\". However, given Murray's injury-ridden exit from the tennis elite after his 2016 triumphs, and the Big Three's continued dominance through year-end 2019, the \"Big Four\" label has been increasingly confined to the 2008–2017 period.\n'Big Five' suggestions.\nOccasionally, it was claimed that the current era in tennis could be seen as featuring a \"Big Five\", with Juan Martín del Potro, Marin Čilić and Stan Wawrinka each suggested as additional expansions to the then Big Four. Wawrinka is the only active player outside the Big Four to have won three major titles (the same number as Murray), defeating Djokovic and Nadal on the way to the 2014 Australian Open title, Federer and Djokovic to win the 2015 French Open, and Djokovic to win the 2016 US Open. He also holds a positive win–loss record in Grand Slam singles finals, winning three of four (the loss being to Nadal in the final of the 2017 French Open), as opposed to Murray who has won only three from eleven (a 27.27% strike rate). However, Wawrinka has reached seven fewer Grand Slam singles finals, has won 13 fewer Masters titles than Murray, and has peaked at only number 3 in the world rankings. Wawrinka himself has downplayed the suggestion that he be included in an expanded \"Big Five\", describing Murray as \"well ahead\" of him.\nGolden era.\nSome, including Steffi Graf and John McEnroe, believe the presence of the Big Four has coincided with that of a new \"Golden Era\" in men's tennis since 2008, wherein depth, athleticism and quality have never been better. The era has been compared to that of Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, Roy Emerson and John Newcombe throughout the 1960s and that of Björn Borg, Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe and Ivan Lendl during the late 1970s and early 1980s.\nNovak Djokovic and Roger Federer have both recognized the period as a golden era for tennis, though Federer tempered discussion around the all-time-greatest status of the Big Four in 2012, commenting:\nThe term Golden Era has also been applied to other famous eras in tennis history including the mid-1970s to 1980s, and the 1920s to the 1930s.\nPrize money.\nDjokovic, Nadal, and Federer make up the top three prize money leaders of all time (not adjusted for inflation).\nAdditionally, they collectively own the 10 biggest single season payouts ranging from $13.06 million to $21.15 million.\nNotable matches.\nWith a combined total of 149 matches played, the Big Three have played many notable matches against each other. The 2008 Wimbledon final, 2009 Australian Open final, 2012 Australian Open final, 2013 French Open semifinal, 2017 Australian Open final, 2018 Wimbledon semifinal and 2019 Wimbledon final are considered some of the greatest tennis matches of all time. Djokovic saved double match points against Federer at the 2010 and 2011 US Open semifinals and the 2019 Wimbledon final, whereas Federer ended Djokovic's 43-match winning streak in the 2011 French Open semifinals. Nadal stopped Djokovic from completing a non-calendar year Grand Slam at the 2012 French Open and has delivered eight of Djokovic's defeats at the tournament, while Djokovic has delivered two of Nadal's three losses at Roland Garros and outlasted him in the longest major final in history at the 2012 Australian Open. Federer ended Nadal's Open Era record 81-match winning streak on clay at the 2007 Hamburg Masters, while Nadal ended Federer's Open Era record 65-match winning streak on grass and five-year dominance at Wimbledon in the 2008 final, and twice denied Federer the non-calendar year Grand Slam at the 2006 and 2007 French Opens."

        "title": "2020 Kentucky Derby",
        "text": "The 2020 Kentucky Derby (officially, the 2020 Kentucky Derby presented by Woodford Reserve) was the 146th Kentucky Derby, and took place on Saturday, September 5, 2020, in Louisville, Kentucky. The race is one of the three legs of the American Triple Crown, open to three-year-old Thoroughbreds. The Kentucky Derby was originally scheduled for the first Saturday of May, but the 2020 running was rescheduled to September 5, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Kentucky. It was won by Authentic.\nAs a result of Authentic's win, horse trainer Bob Baffert tied the record for most Kentucky Derby wins, at six.\nBackground.\nSince 1969, the American Triple Crown has been scheduled to begin with the Kentucky Derby on the first Saturday in May, followed by the Preakness Stakes two weeks later in mid-May, and the Belmont Stakes three weeks after that in early June. Major prep races for the series are normally run from three to six weeks before the Derby. However, the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States led to the shutdown of several race meetings starting in mid-March, which resulted in the postponement or outright cancellation of several of these major preps.\nThe shutdowns led Churchill Downs to reschedule the Kentucky Derby to the first Saturday in September, marking the first time since the 1945 edition was affected by World War II that the Kentucky Derby has taken place outside of its regular May schedule. Pimlico followed suit by rescheduling the 2020 Preakness Stakes to the first Saturday in October. The New York Racing Association (NYRA) decided instead to hold the 2020 Belmont Stakes on June 20, three weeks after racing in New York reopened on June 3. That scheduling made the Belmont the first leg of the 2020 Triple Crown, and meant that the Kentucky Derby was not the first leg of the Triple Crown for the first time since the 1931 edition.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, both the Belmont and Churchill Downs' spring meet (May and June races) were held without spectators. However, Churchill Downs planned to allow spectators for both the Kentucky Oaks on September 4 and the Kentucky Derby on September 5 before reversing course and have no spectators due to an increase in COVID-19 cases throughout the state of Kentucky and the city of Louisville.\nChurchill Downs used a new singular 20-stall starting gate for the 2020 Kentucky Derby, replacing the previous arrangement that used a standard 14-stall gate and an auxiliary six-stall gate. The old setup contributed to congestion at the start of the race, especially in the gap between the two gates.\nPeople protesting the death of Breonna Taylor, which happened in Louisville in April 2020, also gathered outside Churchill Downs before the event took place after marching from Downtown Louisville. Hundreds of these protesters had been gathered in Downtown Louisville for 101 days leading up to the Derby. Counter-demonstrators gathered outside Churchill Downs as well.\nQualification.\nThe Kentucky Derby is only open to three-year-old Thoroughbreds, thus entrants in the 2020 race were foaled in 2017 as part of the North America registered foal crop of 20,620. The field is limited to twenty horses who qualify based on points earned in the 2020 Road to the Kentucky Derby, a series of designated races that was first introduced in 2013. This point system replaced the previous graded stakes race earnings system.\nBecause of the disruption in the 2020 racing schedule, major prep races for the Derby were spread out from March to August. The major preps provided the winner with 100 qualifying points, essentially guaranteeing that horse a berth in the Derby provided the horse remained in form and the owner was willing to pay the required nomination and entry fees. Although nearly 90 horses earned qualifying points, less than 20 of these were willing or able to enter the Derby. This opened the race to horses who had not earned qualifying points, including allowance race winner Money Moves and Mr. Big News, who finished sixth in the Blue Grass Stakes.\nField.\nTiz the Law established himself as the heavy favorite for the Derby by winning the shortened 2020 Belmont Stakes, followed up by a dominant performance in the Travers Stakes at the Derby's distance of 10 furlongs. His only career loss was as a two-year-old in the Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes over a sloppy course at Churchill Downs. He faced a smaller field than has become traditional for the Derby, in part because of attrition due to injury on the extended lead up to the race. This has affected horses such as Nadal (Arkansas Derby – div. 2), Art Collector (Blue Grass Stakes), Basin (Arkansas Derby – div. 1) and Wells Bayou (Louisiana Derby). Other horses such as Rushie opted to bypass the Derby and entered other races. The remaining contenders for the Derby included:\nEntries were taken on September 1. The post position draw was held that day at 11:00 a.m. EST.\nOn September 3, connections withdrew King Guillermo due to a fever; on September 4, Finnick the Fierce was scratched with a foot problem. On the day of the race, Thousand Words was scratched after rearing in the paddock and falling on his side.\nRace description.\nPrior to the race, a bugler played '\"My Old Kentucky Home\", which was preceded by a moment of silence. Due to health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were no paying spectators in attendance. Soon after the Derby ended, the activists who gathered outside Churchill Downs largely disbanded and left the area.\nAuthentic broke poorly from the outside post position, then rushed up to take the lead, completing the first quarter-mile in 22.92, a relatively brisk pace. He raced four wide around the first turn, then moved to the rail along the backstretch while slowing down the pace, completing the half-mile in :46.41 and three-quarters in 1:10.23. Meanwhile, Tiz the Law was tracking the pace a few lengths behind in fourth place, also carried wide around the first turn. Tiz the Law started his move on the final turn and the two were heads apart at the mile pole. Tiz the Law seemed to have the momentum but Authentic rallied and pulled away down the stretch to win by lengths. Longshot Mr. Big News finished third with Honor A. P. closing late for fourth. The final time was 2:00.61.\nThe race gave trainer Bob Baffert his sixth win in the Kentucky Derby, tying the record set by Ben Jones from 1938 to 1952. Baffert gave credit for the win to jockey John Velazquez and assistant trainer Jimmy Barnes, who was injured when Baffert's other horse, Thousand Words, flipped in the paddock shortly before the race while Barnes was trying to saddle him. Although the horse was uninjured, Barnes was taken to the hospital with a broken wrist. \"To me, that was the most emotional Derby I've ever been involved in because of what happened during that little time frame,\" said Baffert. \"It was just something.\"\nAuthentic is owned by Spendthrift Farm, MyRaceHorse Stable, Madaket Stables, and Starlight Racing. Spendthrift Farms, which stands leading sire Into Mischief, bought the majority interest in Authentic, Into Mischief's most successful offspring, in June. Authentic will stand at Spendthrift after retirement. MyRaceHorse Stable consists of roughly 4,500 people who bought a total of 12,500 microshares for $206 each through an online app.\nResults.\nTrack condition: fast\nTimes: mile – 22.92; mile – 46.41; mile – 1:10.23; mile – 1:35.02; final – 2:00.61.&lt;br&gt;\nSplits for each quarter-mile: (22.92) (23.49) (23.82) (24.79) (25.59)\nSource: Equibase chart\nPayouts.\nSource:\nSubsequent Grade I wins.\nThe only horse in the 2020 Derby who subsequently won another Grade I race was Authentic, who won the 2020 Breeders' Cup Classic and was named Horse of the Year. This may be attributable to the late date of the event and the extended prep season that disrupted normal training routines."

The following year, Rose was drafted in 3rd round, 28th overall by the Toronto Rock in the 2008 National Lacrosse League Entry Draft and later helped the Northmen clinch the 2009 Canadian Lacrosse Association’s Minto Cup, where he was also named MVP of the tournament.\nProfessional.\nIn 2010, Rose made the Boston Blazers' opening night roster for the 2010 NLL season. He played his first career NLL game after Mike Poulin was traded to the Calgary Roughnecks and ended up playing a total of 22:05 minutes in his first year with the team. He returned to the Blazers for the 2011 season, before the team was dispersed.\nRose was drafted by the Calgary Roughnecks in the first round of the 2011 Boston Blazers Dispersal Draft. While with the Roughnecks, he played five games and registered 17 saves in two relief appearances. Rose was eventually traded to the Toronto Rock in March 2012 for a first-round pick in the 2014 NLL Entry Draft. He made his debut with the Rock on March 24, 2012, in a 13–7 win over the Rochester Knighthawks. Rose signed a one-year contract extension with the Rock on August 2, 2012. As the starting goaltender for the Rock, Rose went 6–8 in 2014 and 6–2 in 2015 as he led the team to the Champions Cup Finals. By 2016, Rose was named a finalist for the National Lacrosse League's Goaltender of the Year Award after ranking third in the NLL in goals against average and tied for sixth in wins with five. Rose later agreed to 3-year contract extension with the Rock on July 27, 2016.\nThe following year, Rose became the first goaltender in the NLL to score two goals in one season from his crease. At the conclusion of his three-year contract, Rose opted out of becoming an unrestricted free agent and signed a two-year extension with the Rock.\nHeading into the 2023 NLL season, \"Inside Lacrosse\" named Rose the #3 best goalie in the NLL.\nStatistics.\nNLL.\nReference:"

        "title": "2021–22 UEFA Champions League",
        "text": "The 2021–22 UEFA Champions League was the 67th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 30th season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League.\nReal Madrid defeated Liverpool 1–0 in the final, which was played at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, France, for a record-extending 14th European Cup title, and their fifth in nine years. It was originally scheduled to be played at the Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany. However, due to the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final, the hosts were shifted back a year, with Saint Petersburg scheduled to host the 2022 final. Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine which commenced in February 2022, the final was eventually moved to Saint-Denis. As the winners, Real Madrid automatically qualified for the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League group stage, as well as earning the right to play against the winners of the 2021–22 UEFA Europa League, Eintracht Frankfurt, in the 2022 UEFA Super Cup and participate in the 2022 FIFA Club World Cup, both of which they went on to win.\nChelsea were the defending champions, but they were eliminated in the quarter-finals by eventual winners Real Madrid.\nThis season was the first since 1999–2000 (the first season after the dissolution of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup) where three major European club competitions (UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and the newly created UEFA Europa Conference League) are organised by UEFA. No changes were made to the format of the Champions League, but teams that were eliminated from the preliminary round and first qualifying round of the Champions League were now transferred to the Europa Conference League instead of the Europa League.\nOn 24 June 2021, UEFA approved the proposal to abolish the away goals rule in all UEFA club competitions, which had been used since 1965. Accordingly, if in a two-legged tie two teams scored the same number of aggregate goals, the winner of the tie would not be decided by the number of away goals scored by each team but always by 30 minutes of extra time, and if the two teams scored the same number of goals in extra time, the winner would be decided by a penalty shoot-out.\nAssociation team allocation.\nA total of 80 teams from 54 of the 55 UEFA member associations participated in the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League (the exception being Liechtenstein, which did not organise a domestic league). The association ranking based on the UEFA association coefficients was used to determine the number of participating teams for each association:\nAssociation ranking.\nFor the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2020 UEFA association coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2015–16 to 2019–20.\nApart from the allocation based on the association coefficients, associations could have additional teams participating in the Champions League, as noted below:\nDistribution.\nThe following is the access list for this season. As the Champions League title holders, Chelsea, which were guaranteed a berth in the Champions League group stage, already qualified via their domestic league (as fourth place in the 2020-21 Premier League), the following changes to the access list were made:\nTeams.\nThe labels in the parentheses show how each team qualified for the place of its starting round:\nThe second qualifying round, third qualifying round and play-off round were divided into Champions Path (CH) and League Path (LP).\n\"CC: 2021 UEFA club coefficients.\"\nNotes\nSchedule.\nAll matches were played on Tuesdays and Wednesdays apart from the preliminary round final, which was played on a Friday, and the final, which was played on a Saturday. The third qualifying round second legs were only played on a Tuesday due to the 2021 UEFA Super Cup on the following Wednesday. Scheduled kick-off times starting from the play-off round were 18:45 (instead of 18:55 previously) and 21:00 CEST/CET.\nAll draws were held at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, except the group stage draw, which took place in Istanbul, Turkey, on 26 August 2021.\nGroup stage.\nThe draw for the group stage was held in Istanbul, Turkey, on 26 August 2021. The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four. For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots, each of eight teams, based on the following principles:\nTeams from the same association, and due to political reasons, teams from Ukraine and Russia, could not be drawn into the same group. Before the draw, UEFA formed pairings of teams from the same association (one pairing for associations with two or three teams, two pairings for associations with four or five teams) based on television audiences, where one team was drawn into Groups A–D and another team was drawn into Groups E–H, so that the two teams would play on different days.\nThe matches were played on 14–15 September, 28–29 September, 19–20 October, 2–3 November, 23–24 November, and 7–9 December 2021. The top two teams of each group advanced to the round of 16. The third-placed teams were transferred to the Europa League knockout round play-offs, while the fourth-placed teams were eliminated from European competitions for the season.\nSheriff Tiraspol made their debut appearance in the group stage. They were the first team from Moldova to play in the Champions League group stage.\nKnockout phase.\nIn the knockout phase, teams played against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final.\nStatistics.\nStatistics exclude qualifying rounds and play-off round.\nTeam of the season.\nThe UEFA technical study group selected the following players as the team of the tournament.\nEuropean Super League controversy.\nOn 18 April 2021, UEFA, the Football Association, the Premier League, the Italian Football Federation, Serie A, the Royal Spanish Football Federation and La Liga learned of plans from several English, Italian and Spanish clubs to create the European Super League. UEFA and the national associations announced that if such a league were to be established, its participants would be banned from playing in international and domestic competitions. Later that same day, English clubs (Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur), Italian clubs (Inter Milan, Juventus and AC Milan) and Spanish clubs (Atlético Madrid, Barcelona and Real Madrid) announced the establishment of the Super League, putting them at risk of being banned.\nOn 20 April 2021, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur withdrew after the Football Association threatened to ban participating clubs from domestic football, whilst Chelsea withdrew some hours later. This led to the project's collapse, as Atlético Madrid, Inter Milan and AC Milan followed the English clubs by withdrawing. The Super League suspended its operations, with the case to be taken by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to establish whether UEFA and FIFA have the exclusive right to organise competitions.\nOn 7 June 2021, the Swiss Federal Department of Justice and Police notified UEFA and FIFA of the Spanish precautionary measure – which had earlier issued an injunction against UEFA and FIFA and referred a \"cuestión preliminar\" (English: preliminary question) to the CJEU on whether UEFA and FIFA have violated articles 101 and 102 of the TFEU – ruling that neither governing body could not execute sanctions against Super League clubs. On 15 June 2021, it was officially confirmed that the remaining three clubs (Barcelona, Juventus and Real Madrid) – which did not sign the Commitment Declaration of the sanctioned other nine clubs and filed a new motion to scrap the agreement UEFA signed with those nine clubs – were admitted to the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League, pending the disciplinary proceedings UEFA opened against them but which were suspended after the Swiss notification."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Buckeyes represent the Ohio State University in the NCAA's Big Ten Conference.\nOhio State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1898. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Ohio State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2021–22 season."

He was most recently the men's head coach for the Western Michigan Broncos.\nEarly life and education.\nBates played basketball at Florida from 1992 to 1996. He helped the Gators reach the Final Four in 1994. Bates was the 1996 Most Outstanding Academic Player, and was named the 1996 Fred Koss Memorial Award winner. He earned a bachelor's degree in exercise physiology in 1995 and completed his master's degree in sports administration in 1997 at Illinois.\nCoaching career.\nBates began his coaching career as an administrative assistant at Illinois in 1997 under Lon Kruger. Bates became an assistant at Jacksonville in 1998 under Hugh Durham. Bates joined Western Michigan as an assistant in 2000. He decided to take a year off from coaching in 2008, taking a job at a medical supply company to spend more time with his family. Bates returned to Western Michigan for the 2009–10 season. In 2010, Bates decided to become an assistant at Wright State. After two seasons, Bates became homesick for Kalamazoo and returned to Western Michigan. He helped the Broncos reach the NCAA tournament in 2014.\nOn March 28, 2020, Bates was promoted to head coach at Western Michigan, replacing his former boss Steve Hawkins. Athletic director Kathy Beauregard said the COVID-19 pandemic affected the job search but Bates was the right person for the job. Bates' salary increases from $110,000 to $120,000 per year, with an additional $100,000 for multimedia rights and speaking opportunities. He took over a program that finished 21–43 in the past two seasons, but he retained assistant coach Thomas Kelley. Shortly after he was hired, the top two scorers at Western Michigan, Michael Flowers and Brandon Johnson, decided to transfer. On March 7, 2022, Bates was fired, after finishing 5–16 in his first season and 8–23 in his second.\nPersonal life.\nBates is married to the former Annemarie Mernagh, who was an All-Big East volleyball player at the University of Pittsburgh and was an assistant volleyball coach at Western Michigan. They have two daughters, Annelyse and Sydney."

This article states the detailed results, where relevant the controversies, and the progression of the Championship during the series race by race of the European Soling Championships in the years 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983 and 1984. This is based on the major sources: World Sailing, the world governing body for the sport of sailing recognized by the IOC and the IPC, and the publications of the International Soling Association. Unfortunately not all crew names are documented in the major sources.\n1980 Final results.\nAfter the last race the International Jury needed three hours to make the decision about three boats that passed between the control boat and the gate launch during a gate start in race 6. One of them was the team of SR 27 Boris Budnikov. The final decision was that these three competitors retain their place as finished.\nDetailed results are documented of the top 10 teams. The ranking and the net total of the other competitors is also documented.\n1981 Final results.\nDuring Race 6 a team member of Z 232 team Heiki Blok felt overboard and was pickup and returned to his teammates by G 212 team Fritz Geis at that time leader in the event. This very sportive action of G 212 was rewarded by the International jury, after the final race, by reducing his finished position by 5 places. In the final race the both leaders G 212 and OE 73 team Michael Farthofer went over the starting line too early and were disqualified. Team Jörg Hermann DDR 5 then needed a 2nd place to win the event. They however finished 4th and 2nd in the overall ranking.\n1982 Final results.\nDue to difficult race conditions the Dragør Sejlklub race committee needed to use the gate start procedure and the black flag rule many times during this event. The committee finally was able to produce five great races. Two races could not take place. As result there was no discard.\n1983 Final results.\nThis was the first major Soling event where ALL crew members were documented. The role of each crew member became more and more respected! In 1968 and beyond boat names and sail numbers were the top priority of the International Soling Association because that give a good insight of the growth of the class. The organization was more or less an organization of boat owners. This changed during the 80's into an organization for Soling Sailors!\nFurther results.\nFor further results see:"

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Tigers represent the University of Missouri in the NCAA's Southeastern Conference.\nMissouri began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1906. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Missouri's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each team position—who in turn are given the honorific \"All-America\" and typically referred to as \"All-American athletes\", or simply \"All-Americans\". Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. The 2019 NCAA Women's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that will include All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), and the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) for the 2018–19 NCAA Division I women's basketball season. Both AP and USBWA choose three teams, while WBCA lists 10 honorees.\nA consensus All-America team in women's basketball has never been organized. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by AP, USBWA, the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), and the Sporting News to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus All-America men's basketball team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.\nBefore the 2017–18 season, it was impossible for a consensus women's All-America team to be determined because the AP had been the only body that divided its women's selections into separate teams. The USBWA first named separate teams in 2017–18. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA), continues the USBWA's former practice of selecting a single 10-member (plus ties) team. The Sporting News does not select an All-America team in women's basketball.\nAcademic All-Americans.\nThe College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) announced its 15-member 2019 Academic All-America team on March 11, 2019, divided into first, second and third teams with Mikayla Ferenz of Idaho chosen as women's college basketball Academic All-American of the Year.\nWhen a player is listed with two grade-point averages, the first is her undergraduate GPA. Players listed with two majors separated by a slash are double majors unless explicitly designated as undergraduate and graduate programs."

He later became the 52nd President of the Scottish Rugby Union.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nSturrock played for Royal HSFP. In a Royal High Sports Day in 1898, he won the 300 yards dash with a time of 33 and 1/5 seconds.\nReferee career.\nSturrock referred in the Border League in 1906.\nHe refereed in the Scottish Unofficial Championship in 1914 and in 1929.\nSturrock refereed the 1921 England versus Wales match; and the France versus England match that same year. In 1922, he refereed the Wales versus Ireland match.\nAdministrative career.\nHe was a committee member of Royal HSFP in 1909.\nHe gave a speech in 1927 on behalf of the Scottish Rugby Union at the Edinburgh Borderers rugby club dinner on the scarcity of referees in Scotland. He stated it was nearly 25 years since he had become a referee and he would likely continue this until he dropped dead on the field. He was nearer 50 than 40. He urged players on the edge of retiring from the game to take up refereeing. In his experience those retiring players tried refereeing for a few weeks and then dropped it. He stated that clubs would try to take advantage of a young referee. He advised those inexperienced referees to take charge of the game in the first 5 minutes and this should prevent trouble for the rest of the match.\nHe was appointed Vice-President of the Scottish Rugby Union in 1930.\nHe was President of the Scottish Rugby Union for the period 1931 to 1932.\nHe was elected a Special Representative of the SRU in 1933.\nOutside of rugby.\nSturrock was a solicitor. His father, Thomas Sturrock was also a solicitor and also on the Dalkeith Town Council. His father died and Sturrock took over his father's business alongside his brother with the name T. &amp; J. C. Sturrock.\nHe was appointed his father's successor on the Dalkeith Town Council.\nHe was made Justice of the Peace on 22 March 1939.\nDeath.\nSturrock died in an Edinburgh Nursing Home. In the month prior he was advised to take a rest from his duties by his doctor; and was admitted to the nursing home only a week before his death."

        "title": "Interscholastic Equestrian Association",
        "text": "The Interscholastic Equestrian Association (IEA) is a nonprofit organization that gives youth in grades 4-12 the opportunity to compete in team and individual equestrian competition without the financial outlay of owning a horse. IEA offers competition across three disciplines: hunt seat, western, and dressage. Within each discipline, there are divisions for beginning through advanced riders. Riders compete on horses unfamiliar to them, and there are regulations for the placement of riders new to IEA to account for the unique format. IEA was founded in spring of 2002, and has since grown its membership to 14,500 members across 46 states. Teams can be formed through a school or riding stables. \nHunt seat.\nThe hunt seat discipline offers both over fences classes and flat classes, judged on the riders equitation. Within hunt seat 11 divisions are offered. High school members can compete in either Varsity Open over fences (fences set at 2'6), Varsity Intermediate over fences (fences set at 2ft), or Junior Varsity Novice over fences (cross rails). Riders competing in these classes must also enter the corresponding flat classes. There are two flat only divisions; JV Beginner walk-trot-canter, and JV Beginner walk-trot. Middle school members can compete in Future Intermediate over fences (fences set at 2ft) or Future Novice over fences (cross rails), and the corresponding flat classes. There are two flat-only middle school divisions as well; Future Beginner walk/trot/canter, and Future Beginner walk/trot. For the 2019-2020 season, IEA introduced the Intro division for 4th and 5th grade riders. Intro riders may compete in Intro walk/trot/canter or Intro walk/trot, which do not accumulate team points.\nWestern.\nThe western division offers classes in both western horsemanship and reining, both are judged on the riders overall equation and how well they execute the pattern. Riders that enter reining classes must also compete in at least two horsemanship classes in the corresponding division. High school members can compete in Varsity Open Horsemanship and Varsity Open Reining, Varsity Intermediate Horsemanship and Varsity Intermediate Reining, Junior Varsity Novice Horsemanship, and Junior Varsity Novice Reining prep (an optional class that does not count for points). There are two divisions that only offer horsemanship classes; Junior Varsity Beginner walk/jog/lope, and Junior Varsity Beginner walk/jog. Middle school members can compete in Future Intermediate Horsemanship and Reining, Future Novice Horsemanship and reining prep, Future Beginner walk/jog/lope, or Future Beginner walk/jog. Similar to hunt seat, IEA introduced the Intro division for 4th and 5th grade riders for the 2019-2020 season. Intro riders may compete in Intro walk/jog/lope and Intro walk/jog, which do not accumulate team points.\nDressage.\nWithin the dressage discipline, two types of classes are offered: Dressage Test and Dressage Seat Equitation (DSE). There are four divisions offered, Open, Intermediate, Novice, Beginner and Intro. Level specific dressage tests are only offered in the Open, Intermediate and Novice divisions. For Dressage Seat Equitation classes, they are run similar to a hunt seat flat class, but level-appropriate individual testing may also be a part of the class. Dressage was a pilot program for the 2018-2019 season and was officially approved as part of IEA for the 2019-2020 season.\nCompetition.\nIEA competitions are run differently from a traditional horse show. The host team provides most of the horses for riders to draw, with established teams also contributing horses. Prior to competition, each horse is schooled or warmed up by a non-competing rider or trainer, and competitors watch and take notes. After the completion of schooling, the horse draw (random selection of horses for the riders in the class) is announced so the riders know which horse they are riding. Horses are selected for each class based on the horses ability and suitability for that division. For example, the horses in the Novice and Beginner divisions will generally be quieter, and Open mounts will be more talented or difficult horses. Each rider mounts their horse and immediately enters the ring after adjusting their stirrups. Hunt Seat Over Fences riders are permitted to jump two warm-up fences in a pre-determined pattern before their class. Since each rider is on an unfamiliar horse that is new to them, this allows the judge to fairly judge each rider on how well they can ride an unfamiliar horse, which levels the playing field. \nPoints and postseason competition.\nRegular season points are as follows: \n1st place: 7 points\n2nd place: 5 points\n3rd place: 4 points\n4th place: 3 points\n5th place: 2 points \n6th place: 1 point\n7th place and under: 0 Points\nEach rider is allowed to compete in a maximum of 5 shows per season. Hunt Seat riders in Zones 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, and 11 need 18 points to qualify for Regionals and riders in Zones 6 ,7, 8, and 9 need 15 points. Western riders need 15 points to qualify for Regionals. Each region can determine the number of riders that it sends to Zone Finals, and each Zone can send either one or two riders to National Finals based on the size of the zone. \nTeams can also qualify for postseason competition. Prior to the draw, coaches chooses a point rider for each class, and only the point riders placing will count towards team points, therefore a large team doesn't have an advantage. The teams with the highest point totals at the end of the season will qualify for postseason competition."

However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Boston University's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.

The Eagles represent North Carolina Central University in the NCAA's Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference.\nNorth Carolina Central began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1927. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but North Carolina Central's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "The 1982 Women's Cricket World Cup Final was a one-day cricket match between the Australia women's national cricket team and the England women's cricket team played on 7 February 1982 at Lancaster Park in Christchurch, New Zealand. It marked the culmination of the 1982 Women's Cricket World Cup, the third edition of the tournament, but was the first time a final had been held; both the previous events had been round-robin tournaments. Both Australia and England had previously won the competition; England won the inaugural tournament in 1973, while Australia won in 1978. Australia won the match by three wickets to claim their second world title.\nAustralia and England finished first and second in the league-stage to claim their places in the final. Australia had gone unbeaten throughout the round-robin, having won eleven of their matches and tied with England in the other. England had won seven of their matches, lost three and tied twice, and finished 14 points behind Australia and 6 ahead of New Zealand. The final was umpired by Dickie Bird and Fred Goodall. England batted first in the final, and scored slowly, particularly against Australia's spin bowling. Jan Southgate top-scored for England with 53 runs, as they made 151 for five. In response, Australia initially struggled, losing their first three wickets for 28 runs. A partnership between Karen Read and Sharon Tredrea recovered their innings, before quick scoring from Jen Jacobs and Marie Cornish saw them to victory.\nBackground.\nThe 1982 Women's Cricket World Cup was the third Women's Cricket World Cup. The first had been held in 1973, pre-dating the first men's Cricket World Cup by two years. The 1982 tournament featured five teams; Australia, England, India, New Zealand and an International XI. It took place between 10 January and 7 February, featuring 31 matches over 29 days. England had won the first world cup on home soil, before Australia claimed the second, held in India. Neither tournament had featured a final, but had rather been league competitions, in which the team which finished with the most points won.\nRoute to the final.\nEach team played twelve matches during the round-robin stage of the tournament, facing each other three times. The top two teams would progress directly to the final, the first time the tournament would feature a final. Australia remained unbeaten; they won eleven of their matches and tied their other, against England. On the opening day of the tournament, Jill Kennare scored 98 runs, as Australia beat India by 153 runs. Four days later, England's Jan Brittin made the highest score of the tournament, 138 not out, against the International XI. England won seven of their matches, lost three times (twice against Australia and once against India), and tied two matches (in addition to the tie against Australia, they also tied with New Zealand). Australia finished top of the table with 46 points, and England were second with 32. Hosts New Zealand scored 26 points, India 16, while the International XI lost all their matches to finish with no points.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe final was played at Lancaster Park, in Christchurch, New Zealand, on 7 February, in front of a crowd of around 3,000. The match was umpired by a New Zealander, Fred Goodall, and the English umpire, Dickie Bird. By officiating in the match, Bird became the only umpire to stand in both a men's and women's World Cup final, having previously umpired the 1975 Cricket World Cup Final. The England captain, Susan Goatman, won the toss, and chose to bat first on a pitch described as \"placid\" by the Australian press. The England opening batters, Brittin and Goatman, scored slowly, putting on 42 runs together before Brittin was dismissed by a diving catch from Marie Cornish off her own bowling for 17 runs. England scored another 12 runs before Goatman was bowled by Lyn Fullston for 29. Fullston was also the bowler for the next wicket; Chris Watmough was caught at mid-on by Kennare for 9, and England were 63 for three. England's experienced partnership of Jan Southgate and Rachael Heyhoe-Flint aimed to recover the England innings, but were restricted by Australia's spin bowling. Southgate in particular was described in \"The Age\" as being \"uncomfortable against the spin\", while \"The Times\" criticised Heyhoe-Flint for \"not forcing the pace when England had wickets in hand.\" In the final ten overs, the England batters began to score more quickly; but both were dismissed shortly before the close of the innings. Southgate, who made the team's highest score, 53 runs, was caught by Sharyn Hill off the bowling of Sharon Tredrea, while Heyhoe-Flint was caught by Fullston off Tredrea's bowling for 29. England finished with 151 for five.\nAustralia's reply started poorly; they lost three wickets in the first eleven overs, taking the score to 28 for three. Their opening pair, Peta Verco and Hill, were both caught by Goatman off the bowling of Avril Starling, while Kennare was the first of three Australian to be run out. Karen Read and Australia's captain, Tredrea, formed a solid partnership and steadied their team's innings. The pair scored 54 runs together before they were both dismissed in quick succession; Read was caught by Southgate off the bowling of Janet Tedstone for 32, while Tredrea was caught behind off Carole Hodges for 25. Australia were 97 for five, needing another 55 runs to win. England adopted a tight field to minimise Australia's scoring options, but Jen Jacobs lofted the ball over the fielders during her innings of 37, which \"The Times\" described as one of the highlights of the match. Cornish, who had been playing a support role until that point, then assumed control and scored seven runs from one over bowled by Enid Bakewell, but with Australia still needing seven runs, Raelee Thompson was run out. \"The Times\" praised England's \"excellent work in the field\", though it was ultimately a mis-field that gave Australia their winning run in the penultimate over. Cornish remained not out with 24 runs, and Australia won the match by three wickets with six balls remaining.\nScorecard.\nUmpires:\nKey\nAftermath.\nEngland's Brittin finished at the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 391 runs, while Australia's Fullston took the most wickets, with 23. England's captain, Goatman, announced her retirement after the tournament; she had led England for three years, having previously captained the Young England team during the 1973 tournament. Southgate was appointed as her replacement as captain. Writing for \"Wisden\", Netta Rheinberg noted that England could no longer \"consider themselves able to fend off all challenges\", and that as a result they implemented efforts to improve cricket at a junior level, to encourage future talent.\nAustralia and England met again in the final of the 1988 Women's Cricket World Cup, when Australia won by eight wickets. Between them, Australia and England have won ten of the eleven Women's Cricket World Cups; only in 2000 did one of the pair fail to win, when New Zealand beat Australia in the final."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Tigers represent Louisiana State University in the NCAA's Southeastern Conference.\nLSU began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1908. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but LSU's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

During this time period, Lewis was the head coach for the Fordham Rams women's basketball team, T.C. Williams High School girls basketball team, and Georgetown Hoyas women's basketball team.\nEarly life and education.\nLewis was born on December 15, 1946, in Alexandria, Virginia. During the 1960s, Lewis lived in Parker-Gray before he left for Groveton, Virginia. At both of these locations, Lewis was a boys basketball player. Outside of basketball, he was on a boys football team and had a leg fracture.\nAfter joining West Virginia University in 1964, he was their \"first [African American] basketball player to sign an athletic grant-in-aid\". During December 1964, Lewis had surgery to his leg while playing basketball for West Virginia. By early 1965, he had surgeries to his knees and stopped playing basketball. Due to his knee surgeries, Lewis did not play for West Viriginia during the 1965-1966 basketball season. By December 1966, Lewis had returned to the roster for West Virginia.\nIn January 1967, Lewis had a foot fracture and was scheduled to miss over a month of games for West Virginia. After returning in March 1967, Lewis remained with West Virginia until 1968. During these two years, Lewis had a combined total of 106 rebounds and 125 points after appearing in 36 games.\nOutside of basketball, Lewis studied journalism at West Virigina before leaving for the University of Detroit as a graduate student. For additional education, Lewis went to Tennessee State University for a physical education program.\nCareer.\nFrom 1969 to 1971, Lewis was an assistant coach for one year each at Tennessee State and Gannon College. He continued his assistant coaching tenure in 1971 with five-year positions at Duke University and Tulane University. In 1981, Lewis was hired by South Lakes High School as a gym teacher before he became their head coach of the boys' basketball team. At South Lakes, Lewis had 59 wins and 15 losses before he left his coaching position in 1984.\nIn 1984, Lewis became the head coach of the George Mason Patriots women's basketball team. While with George Mason, Lewis was an assistant coach for USA Basketball in the 1990s. With USA Basketball, Lewis was an assistant women's basketball coach during the 1994 R. William Jones Cup and the 1995 World University Games. At George Mason, Lewis had 201 wins and 177 losses before he was replaced by Debbie Taneyhill during the 1997 season. \nThat year, Lewis was hired as the inaugural head coach of the Washington Mystics.

With Fordham, Lewis had 56 wins and 118 losses between 2000 and 2006. In 2006, Lewis returned to the WNBA as an assistant coach for the Minnesota Lynx. As the T.C. Williams High School girls basketball coach from 2007 to 2008, Lewis obtained 22 wins and 1 loss before he resumed his WNBA experience with the Indiana Fever in 2008. From 2008 to 2010, Lewis worked with the Fever as a scout and assistant coach before becoming an assistant coach for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets women's basketball team in 2010.\nLewis stayed with Georgia Tech for a year before being hired by the Los Angeles Sparks in 2012 as an assistant coach.

        "title": "History of the Rugby League World Cup",
        "text": "The Rugby League World Cup is an international rugby league tournament currently played every four years. The first tournament was held in 1954, hosted by France who had pushed for such a tournament to be approved. Since the first edition, 14 others have been held at sporadic intervals.\nPre–1954: Establishment.\nSince 1935, the French had been campaigning this initiative of an international tournament like the World Cup. Previously, nations had done tours of other test playing nations, however there wasn't one particular unifying tournament between rugby league's best nations. Eventually, in 1951, Paul Barrière, the president of French Rugby League at the time, raised the idea of the World Cup. A year later, Rugby Football League secretary Bill Fallowfield persuaded the Rugby League Council to back the idea. The following year, at a meeting in Blackpool, the International Board accepted Barrière's proposal of the World Cup.\n1954–1960: Early tournaments.\nIn 1954, the first tournament was conducted in Barrière's home nation, with Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand, Francs rounding out the four team tournament. In the final, Great Britain downed France 16–12 at the Parc des Princes in Paris in front of 30,368 fans on 13 November. France then donated the trophy (now known as the Paul Barrière Trophy) to the International Board. The cup, at the time, was worth eight million francs and is still in use today.\nIn the next tournament three years later, it was decided that the four nations from the first tournament would play each other again in a round-robin format, however with no final,the team which finished on top would be the victors. Australia went on to win the 1957 tournament on home soil. The tournament returned again three years later, with Great Britain taking the tournament out at home. That tournament was widely regarded as a great success.\n1960–1977: Sporadic competitions.\nIt was not until eight years later when the tournament would return. There were plans, announced at a 1962 International Board meeting by Bill Fallowfield, for a 1965 tournament which would return to France and feature South Africa for the first time. These plans were later scrapped after a poor tour of Australia by the planned hosts France. In 1968, the competition returned with Australia beating France in the first final since the inaugural competition 20–2 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in front of 54,290 people. That tournament also featured Australia's highest crowd for a World Cup match, with 62,256 people in attendance at the SCG for their pool match against Great Britain. The hosts won that match 25–10. The tournament was then held every two years, with Australia becoming the first nation to retain their title, doing so over in England in 1970 and Great Britain winning their third and last competition in France in 1972. They won this tournament, despite tying with Australia 10–all in the final, because of their superior group stage record.\nIn 1975, was hosted across two federations. Great Britain split into England and Wales for the 1975 tournament as Wales wanted to showcase the high level of talent they had (no Scottish or Irish players made the original squad), this created a five team tournament for the first time. A final was not planned for that tournament, with the winner meant to have come from the team who finished top. However, despite finishing first, Australia hadn't defeated England yet so they played a challenge match against the English at Headingley. This didn't prove to be an issue for the Australians however, as they won that match 25–0 in front of 7,680 people.\nIn 1977, Great Britain returned as a single, combined entity and the World Cup saw Australia and New Zealand hosting. The final was closely fought, with Australia coming out on top against Great Britain 13–12 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. However, due to the constant tinkering with the format of the tournament, the public was starting to lose interest, and it would be eight years until the tournament returned.\n1985–1992: Decentralised tournament.\nThe next tournament was held across four years, from 1985 to 1988, with the teams playing each other twice both at home and away. This tournament also saw the debut of Papua New Guinea, who triumphantly beat New Zealand 24–22 at the PNG Football Stadium (then called Lloyd Robson Oval) in Port Moresby. This tournament culminated with Australia defeating New Zealand 25–12 in the final at Auckland's Eden Park in front of 47,363 people, the largest rugby league crowd New Zealand has ever seen. The format remained for the following edition, which ran between 1989 and 1992. This tournament was won again by Australia, who defeated Great Britain 10–6 in the final at the Wembley Stadium in front of 73,361, a record crowd for the tournament not broken until the 2013 final at Old Trafford. That tournament would also be the last to feature Great Britain, with England and Wales taking their place.\n1995–2000: Expansion.\nFor the 1995 World Cup, various changes were made to the format and running of the tournament. The tournament returned to having a centralised host, with England and Wales jointly hosting the tournament. The tournament also expanded to ten teams, with Fiji, Samoa, South Africa and Tonga making their tournament debuts. Also, due to the Super League war, the Australian team was weakened as players contracted to the Super League clubs were unable to be selected for the Kangaroos. The teams were split into three groups, with Group A containing four teams whilst B and C contained three teams each. The top two teams of Group A, alongside the winners of Groups B and C, formed the semi-final stage. Here, England beat Wales 25–10 while Australia beat New Zealand 30–20 after extra time. The final was won by Australia, 16–8 at the Wembley Stadium. This tournament also celebrated the 100th anniversary of rugby league and was a success, with crowds upwards of 250,000 people attending the group stages and 66,540 at the final match.\nThe 2000 World Cup then took place five years later in the British Isles and France. This time it held a further expanded field of sixteen teams, including the debuts of Cook Islands, Ireland, Lebanon, Russia, Scotland and Aotearoa Māori, who were a representative team made up of players of Māori descent. These teams were drawn into four groups of four teams each, where the top two teams in each group qualified for the knockout stage. The Final was played at Manchester's Old Trafford in front of 44,329 people. It was played between Australia and New Zealand, with Australia winning 40–12.\n2008–present: Regular competition.\nTo mark the centenary of rugby league in Australia, the World Cup was brought back eight years later, and the 2008 World Cup occurred along the east coast of the nation. This tournament saw the number of teams cut to ten, with one super group of four and two smaller groups with three teams in each. Prior to the tournament, Australia beat New Zealand 58–0 in a warm-up match. However, this was not at all a foreshadowing of the tournament which was just about to occur. The opening ceremony took place on 26 October, with a match between the Indigenous Dreamtime and the New Zealand Māori representative teams acting as a curtain raiser for the tournament at the Sydney Football Stadium. The Dreamtime side won 34–26. Australia beat New Zealand in the official tournament opener 30–6 in front of 34,157 fans. After their massive loss before the tournament, the Kiwis went into the final destined for revenge, but an upset would be needed to stop the rampaging Australian side, who had defeated Fiji 52–0 in the semi-finals. To the shock of the rugby league world, the Kiwis won against the Kangaroos, 34–20, in one of the shock international rugby league results of all time. This would be the first World Cup win for the Kiwis, who had participated in every edition of the tournament. Controversy occurred after the match, with Australia coach Ricky Stuart verbally attacking Geoff Carr, the head of the ARL, alongside aggressively intimidating referee Ashley Klein and Stuart Cummings, the RFL director of match officials, at the hotel. This led to Stuart's resignation. Off the field, the tournament was a massive success, with an average attendance 91% higher than that of the tournament eight years prior. The final also sold out months in advance.\nOriginally scheduled for 2012, England and Wales, with games also in Ireland and France, hosted the 14-team 2013 World Cup, which has been considered the most successful tournament to date. The tournament was moved very early in its organisation to 2013 due to the United Kingdom hosting the 2012 Summer Olympics. The tournament opened with a double-header at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, with debutants Italy beating Wales 32–16 before Australia defeated England 28–20 in front of 45,052 fans. This crowd was the largest opening day crowd and the largest rugby league crowd in Wales. The tournament also saw the largest rugby league crowd in Ireland, with 5,021 watching Ireland go down to Australia 50–0 at Limerick's Thomond Park. Another success story of the tournament was the United States making the quarter-finals on their tournament debut, before succumbing to Australia 62–0. The semi-finals were played at Wembley Stadium, with 67,545 people attending the double-header, with New Zealand defeating England 20–18 thanks to a last minute try by Shaun Johnson before Australia defeated Fiji 64–0 directly after. The final was then played at Old Trafford, where Australia won their tenth World Cup, defeating New Zealand 34–2 in front of 74,468 people, the largest international rugby league crowd of all time.\nThe 2017 World Cup took place in Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea four years later. The tournament initially grew traction after high-profile stars Jason Taumalolo and Andrew Fifita led a wave of players pledging their international allegiance to Tonga, their nation of heritage, instead of New Zealand and Australia. Using the same format as the previous tournament, there were various upsets in the matches, with Lebanon defeating France, and both Tonga and Fiji defeating New Zealand, giving the Kiwis their worst result since the expansion of the tournament in some of rugby league's shock all-time results. Lebanon and Tonga both saw their best tournament performances, reaching the quarter-finals and semi finals respectively. The tournament also featured three sell-out matches at the PNG Football Stadium in Port Moresby involving the home nation and a full crowd of 30,003 at Auckland's Mount Smart Stadium, who witnessed the tense semi-final between England and Tonga. One particular controversy was that Sydney only hosted two low/mid-drawing matches both involving Lebanon. The tournament organisers however defended this \"Sydney Cup snub\". The final was again played at Brisbane's Lang Park, with 40,033 fans witnessing Australia defeat England 6–0 to claim their eleventh tournament.\nEngland were chosen to host the 2021 tournament which was postponed to 2022 due to Australia and New Zealand withdrawing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. with organisers expressing a desire to see a total of one million fans attend games. This tournament saw the number of teams increased to 16 once again, with Greece and Jamaica debuting in the competition. In 2021, the women's and wheelchair competitions were given equal prominence with the men's tournament, as a result all three competition were run simultaneously for the first time. Australia again won the competition, beating final debutants Samoa 30–10. The 2021 tournament was the most watched rugby league world cup in history, and was regarded as a sporting, commercial, and social success by the IRL.\nA proposal was put forward in 2016 to hold the 2025 Rugby League World Cup in the United States and Canada, but in December 2018 plans for the tournament to be held in North America were scrapped due to financial concerns.\nOn 11 January 2022, it was announced France would host the tournament in 2025, however on 15 May 2023 France pulled out of hosting the tournament after the French government withdrew financial support. A day later, New Zealand announced they were considering a bid, but would possibly require a delay to 2026.\nOn 3 August, the IRL announced that the tournament would be postponed to 2026 and held in the southern hemisphere with only 10 teams taking part.\nWith the announcement of the 2025 World Cup to 2026 came confirmation that the following competition would be held in 2030. In the announcement International Rugby League confirmed that the tournament would be held once again as a stand alone competition with the women's and wheelchair tournaments held separately."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Tar Heels represent the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the NCAA's Atlantic Coast Conference.\nNorth Carolina began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1910. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but North Carolina's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

The first two Test matches were drawn; the \"Wisden\" editor blamed the West Indies' lack of a spin bowler as preventing them from winning the first match, while in the second match a whole day was lost to rain with England on top. The West Indies won the three remaining Test matches to win the series 3–0, largely due to their fast bowlers. Viv Richards scored two double centuries, and finished as the leading run-scorer on either team, despite missing the second Test with an injury.\nIn the three-match One Day International series, Richards was again dominant in the first two games, scoring 119 and 97 to help the West Indies to victories. In the third ODI, when Richards was dismissed without scoring, Gordon Greenidge scored 42 and Clive Lloyd made 79 to guide their side to a 50-run win. The last two matches were each affected by rain; the second ODI was spread over two days, while the third utilised the reserve day after no play was possible at all on first day.\nAustralia women in England.\nThe Australia national women's cricket team was invited to England to help celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Women's Cricket Association."

The Seminoles represent Florida State University in the NCAA's Atlantic Coast Conference.\nFlorida State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1947. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Florida State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.

        "text": "The 1911–12 Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey season was the 15th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nDuring the offseason, Harvard had withdrawn from the Intercollegiate Hockey Association. The team had reservations about the policies enacted by the operators of the St. Nicholas Rink, which delayed Harvard's entry into the conference for several years, but new policies forced the program to cease dealing with the rink, Because the IHA schedule was conducted almost entirely at the St. Nicholas Rink, Harvard had to withdraw from the league.\nDespite leaving, Harvard scheduled many of their former conference opponents for the 1911–12 season and were able to use their home rink, the Boston Arena, as the venue for most games. The Crimson had narrowly missed out on championships in the previous two seasons and were eager to prove that they were the cream of the college hockey crop. There was also a moment to promote ice hockey from a minor to a major sport for the university. The team's play over the course of the season would go a long way to furthering those efforts, but the Crimson couldn't have started much worse when they lost 1–4 to MIT, though they were missing many of their regular players.\nDue to the winter break, the Crimson had almost three weeks before their next game. When they hit the ice they did so against Princeton who now possessed one of, if not the best, player in college hockey, Hobey Baker. Harvard was not daunted, however, and the Crimson defense produced a stalwart effort. With Gardner between the pipes, Harvard was able to hold back the potent Tiger attack and keep the game knotted at the end of the first half. The defense fought off Princeton in the second half and allowed team captain Huntington to score what proved to be the game-winner. Ten days later the two teams met in a rematch at the Boston Arena. The building was packed to the gills with spectators wanting to see the two best teams in the nation and they were not disappointed. The game progressed as expected with Princeton's mighty offense assailing the stout Crimson defenders, and this time it was the Tigers who ended up as victors with Baker netting the deciding score.\nA week later the team played defending champion Cornell in one of the most disorganized performance of the year. The two teams skated to an unsatisfying draw after regulation and when neither could score in the 10-minute overtime, a second sudden-death session was played with Harvard finishing on top from a Duncan shot. This may be the first use of sudden death overtime in an intercollegiate game. Teamwork continued to elude the Crimson in their next contest but their talent allowed them to defeat St. Francis Xavier. When undefeated McGill came to town the Crimson played one of their best games all year and shut out the Reds 3–0.\nIn their game against Dartmouth the Crimson again played down to their opposition, winning 7–3 despite sloppy play. The team knew they couldn't play that way in the series against Yale to end their season, not if they wanted to win. Once more Harvard's defense was outstanding allowing Gardner and Smart to share the shutout while Sortwell netted his second hat-trick. The second game four days later was played in New Haven under less than ideal circumstances. Sticky ice caused the game to devolve into a disorganized mess and the lack of cohesion allowed Yale to carry the day, winning 3–2 to force a decisive rubber match with Harvard. In their final game the Crimson proved the victors with a 4–2 win. The triumph capped a mostly successful season in which Harvard defeated both the American and Canadian collegiate champions but had no title to call their own.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

It is the sequel to \"AO Tennis\" and holds the official license of the tennis Grand Slam Australian Open. The game was initially released on 9 January 2020 for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.\nGameplay.\n\"AO Tennis 2\" game features multiple types of tennis match. The re-designed career mode features a new managing system. Players have to earn money and experience that can be used to boost players' skills and stats. The higher level is, the better form would like to perform. While performance on court is important, how to deal with press conference, how to maintain good relationship with your team would also be critical for players' reputations and decide the quality of sponsors that players can pick up.\nIn addition to the solo game, the game introduces a multiplayer mode which offers up to four local players competing head-to-head. A cooperation mode is also available so that players can team up in doubles online. Like its predecessor \"AO Tennis\", all custom players and venues sharing with the community are downloadable for the game.\nDevelopment and release.\n\"AO Tennis 2\" was revealed with a game trailer in November 2019. It is developed and published by the Australia-based video game developer Big Ant Studios, the developer of \"AO Tennis\". It is the second video game that holds the official license of the Australian Open, which gives the game plenty star players from ATP and WTA, including Rafael Nadal, Stan Wawrinka, Angelique Kerber, Ashleigh Barty and more.\nThe game was released on 9 January 2020 in Europe and 11 February 2020 in North America for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. In Japan, the game was made available on 14 May 2020. An official editing tool, which allows players to create their own players and stadiums and share online was available via Steam. The game was released for Amazon Luna on 20 October 2020.\nReception.\n\"AO Tennis 2\" received \"mixed or average\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.\nThe game received a 7 from \"IGN\". The reviewer Tristan Ogilvie commented the game was \"better-looking\" and \"smoother-playing\", and approved the improvement of the series.\nThe highest score came from William Thompson of \"Hooked Gamers\", who gave 8 points out of a possible 10 to the game. He praised the refined career mode, and commented \"\"AO Tennis 2\" is a heap of fun\", but he felt AI players seemed to be invulnerable as they were often able to hit the ball from anywhere.\nDominic Leighton of \"The Sixth Axis\" also rated the game an 8 out of 10, summarizing the game \"bright\" and \"likeable\". He was pleased with the in-game player creator and community support, as well as the depth of the game. However, he was not happy with the weird crowd sounds and thought licensed players were far from enough either.\nBrian Mazique compared the game with its predecessor \"AO Tennis\", and said the game \"has more positives than negatives\", but he also mentioned the \"AO tennis\" series was not \"as complete as other sports titles\".\nMatt Hewson of \"player2.net\" wrote a review when the game was released based on the Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions. He rated the game \"B\", praising the developer Big Ant Studios learned from their last release \"AO Tennis\". He also wrote that the game was \"a deep and rewarding simulation\", and felt the game was \"an ace\" for hardcore tennis fans.\nMatt Cox wrote a review at \"Rock, Paper, Shotgun\", commenting \"it would be unfair to single out \"AO Tennis 2\" for replicating the banality of tennis when every sports ’em up has the same conceptual flaw\".\nTY Sheedlo gave two stars out of five at \"Screen Rant\", which was the lowest score the game received. He described the game was \"a headache\", found it too hardcore to enjoy, even with its soft-rock soundtrack. He also complained the game was \"unlikely to inspire any interest in the sport on its own\"."

        "text": "The 1912–13 Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey season was the 16th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nHarvard entered the year with a team that may have been less talented than previous squads, but it was no less competitive. The team displayed an increasing level of play throughout December between practices and scrimmages with the Boston Athletic Association. The available ice at the Boston Arena paid dividends for the Crimson in allowing them to hone their game in their attempt to reclaim the championship.\nThe Crimson made up for last year's poor start with a dominant 4–0 win over MIT where the team used many of its backup players throughout the game. After returning from the winter break Harvard faced a tough Ottawa team and could not find its footing offensively, losing 0–2 despite a stellar effort from team captain Gardner. The team buckled down and prepared itself for a match against Toronto a week later. When the Blues arrived in town they found an impenetrable wall in front of the Harvard cage and left after a 0–2 loss to the Crimson.\nAfter dismantling Cornell 8–2, Harvard welcomed defending champion Princeton in one of the most anticipated games of the season. The teams locked horns and battled nearly the same as they had the year before; Princeton's offense, led by Hobey Baker applied a continual assault on the Crimson defenders but neither team could beat the other in regulation. With the score 3–3 the two teams had agreed to play two 5-minute overtime periods in case they were needed. Harvard was able to score once in each extra frame and take the game 5–3, putting themselves at a great advantage in their pursuit of a championship.\nBy the time Harvard played Yale on February 1, the teams had arranged a best-of-three series so that Harvard, Yale and Princeton would play one another at least twice. If any of the three emerged as a clear victor they would likely be able to claim the collegiate championship as the teams were typically among the best in the nation. Harvard's solid win over the Bulldogs had them on the cusp of a terrific season but in the second game against Princeton the Tiger attack was too much to cope with and a third game was required to settle the series. While the third game would not officially decide the champion, as Harvard still had Yale left to play, Princeton could secure the championship if it won the rubber match. With this in mind Gardner produced one of the most brilliant goaltending performances in school history, turning away 29 shots en route to a 3–0 victory, the only time in the three years with Baker that Princeton would fail to score.\nWith Yale still remaining, Harvard couldn't slow down if they wanted to claim the championship. The Elis played Harvard tough in the first half, scoring the only goal of the frame to put a bit of fear in the minds of the Crimson faithful. The game remained the same through most of the second half but with 5 minutes left the Crimson offense awoke and scored three times. Yale added one just before the end of the game but it wasn't enough to turn the tide and Harvard skated away with the collegiate hockey championship.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\nScoring Statistics.\n&lt;br&gt;"

However some sources have his year of birth as either 1881, or 1888. He attended school up until the 8th grade. As a child, he served as a caddie at the Audubon Golf Course; in adulthood he became a greenskeeper at the course.\nCareer.\nBartholomew was the first African American man to build a public golf course, even though he was often barred from playing on these fields due to racial segregation. His first construction project was for the Metairie Golf Club. After spending time in New York learning about golf course architecture, he began construction of the Louisiana course in 1922. For the next ten years, Bartholomew designed and built several courses across Louisiana, including City Park No. 1, City Park No. 2, and Pontchartrain Park in New Orleans. The Pontchartrain was renamed \"Joseph M. Bartholomew Sr. Golf Course\", for Bartholomew in 1979.\nBartholomew also maintained his own construction company and expanded his business into landscaping.\nHe was the first African-American inducted to the Greater New Orleans Sports Hall of Fame. He was a major contributor to Dillard University and Xavier University of Louisiana. Bartholomew's profile was included in the biographical dictionary \"\" (2004)."

        "title": "President of the Scottish Rugby Union",
        "text": "The president of the Scottish Rugby Union is the figurehead of rugby union in Scotland.\nOrigin.\nIn 1873, and directly after the Scotland versus England international match, representatives from eight Scottish rugby union sides came together in Glasgow at the Glasgow Academy in Elmbank Street. They decided to form an organisation to develop the sport in Scotland. It was initially called the Scottish Football Union, but changed its name to the Scottish Rugby Union to give clarity from association football.\nThey had a number of initial aims:- to help promote a cup competition; to bring closer working between the Scottish clubs; and to form a committee so that the Scotland international team could be picked.\nA committee was thus formed and John Chiene was nominated as the chair. Chiene thus became the first president of the Scottish Rugby Union.\nPowers and duties.\nThe objective of the president of the SRU is to ensure a coordinated, collegiate approach to working with all stakeholders in the game.\nEach president holds the role of chairman of the Scottish Rugby Council concurrently when in office.\nCeremonial roles.\nThe president of the Scottish Rugby Union has performed many ceremonial roles to promote the sport in Scotland. These have included presenting the match ball in the Six Nations Championship; and providing International players with their caps.\nSelection process.\nThe member clubs provide candidates for election as president of the Scottish Rugby Union. Usually two candidates are nominated; the first three-way candidate election was in 2007.\nIt is common for the vice-president to win the backing of the clubs when the president steps down from the role. The office of vice-president is also an elected one.\nElection.\nThe members clubs of the Scottish Rugby Union vote to see who becomes president. The vote is held at the Annual General Meeting; and is ratified at the AGM.\nTenure.\nThe post was traditionally a one-year term, but presidents were allowed to run for office for a subsequent year.\nJohn Chiene is the only president to hold the role for two distinct time periods, becoming the first and fifth president. This is now prohibited by Bye-Law 12.4 which states:-\nWithout prejudice to interim appointments made under Bye-Law 12.8 or Bye-Law 12.10, a person is\nonly eligible to be elected once as Vice-President and to hold office once as President.\nTom Scott held the post before and after the First World War. There were no presidents elected during the conflict and his two terms can be considered contiguous. Indeed, sources usually attribute his period for the entire war.\nThe Second World War meant Presidencys were longer: Patrick Munro was president from 1939 to 1942; and Harry Smith took over from 1942 until 1947.\nIn 2016, Rob Flockhart became the first 'two-term' president. This rule-change meant that Flockhart - and subsequent presidents - could serve two years without standing for election for the second term."

        "title": "2021 Copa América final",
        "text": "The 2021 Copa América final was a football match to determine the winners of the 2021 Copa América. The match was the 47th final of the Copa América, a quadrennial tournament contested by the men's national teams of the member associations of CONMEBOL. The match was held at Estádio do Maracanã in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on 10 July 2021.\nThe match featured two rival teams: Argentina and the tournament hosts, Brazil. Argentina won the match 1–0 to clinch their fifteenth Copa América title and first since 1993, giving captain Lionel Messi his first senior international trophy sixteen years into his career and ending a 28-year trophy drought. Argentina also equalled Uruguay's record of Copa América titles. Argentina would go on to win the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions against Italy, as well as the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\nBackground.\nArgentina and Brazil are long-time rivals, having played 107 prior matches in international competition. The two teams are among the most successful in South American football and had met in three prior Copa América finals in 1937, 2004, and 2007.\nIn Bangladesh, where the two teams have large fanbases, police banned outdoor gatherings in certain rural districts after clashes erupted between rival fans. In the Brahmanbaria District, a clash between fans resulted in serious injuries to four people.\nVenue.\nThe 2021 Copa América was originally planned to be hosted by Argentina and Colombia, with the final scheduled for 12 July 2020 at the Estadio Metropolitano Roberto Meléndez in Barranquilla, Colombia. On 17 March 2020, CONMEBOL announced that the tournament would be postponed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, alongside the 2020 European Championships. Weeks before the tournament, Colombia was removed as host amid the ongoing protests in the country, while Argentina announced that they would be unable to host due to the worsening COVID-19 case rate and were replaced with Brazil despite their high death rate.\nFor the second consecutive time, the final was held at Rio de Janeiro's Maracanã Stadium, the largest stadium in Brazil. It was opened at 10 percent capacity, or 6,500 spectators, for the match due to COVID-19 restrictions. The stadium was excluded from hosting matches in earlier rounds of the competition due to its damaged pitch and was replaced with Estádio Olímpico Nilton Santos, where players criticised the playing surface. The pitch at the Maracanã was re-laid by CONMEBOL a few days before the final.\nOfficials.\nThe referee in charge of the match was Esteban Ostojich from Uruguay. Ostojich, along with fellow Uruguayan linesmen Carlos Barreiro and Martín Soppi, had also officiated group stage matches between Brazil and Venezuela, Peru and Colombia, and quarter final match between Peru and Paraguay. Peruvian referee Diego Haro was the fourth official having officiated in the group stage match between Bolivia and Paraguay and also as fourth official in the Argentina versus Bolivia group stage match. Uruguayan Andrés Cunha was the main video assistant referee.\nRoute to the final.\nArgentina.\nArgentina was the second-most successful nation at the Copa América with 14 victories, only one behind Uruguay's all-time total of 15 titles, but had not won since 1993. The team was seeded into Group A one of the tournament's original co-hosts and was joined by Bolivia, Uruguay, Chile, Paraguay, and invitees Australia until their withdrawal. Argentina had been transitioning away from its 2010s \"golden generation\" in favor of a younger core, which was reflected in manager Lionel Scaloni's call-ups for La Albiceleste. The team remained led by captain Lionel Messi, along with veterans Ángel Di María and Sergio Agüero, as the last three remaining members of the 2014 World Cup team that finished as runners-up to Germany.\nLa Albiceleste opened the group stage against Chile, earning a 1–1 draw. Lionel Messi scored a free kick to give Argentina the lead in the first half, but Eduardo Vargas equalised in the second half by finishing a rebound shot after a penalty taken by Arturo Vidal was saved. Argentina moved to the top of Group A by defeating Uruguay 1–0 with a header scored by Guido Rodríguez off a cross from Messi. The team secured a berth in the knockout stage on the third matchday with a 1–0 victory against Paraguay; Papu Gómez scored the lone goal of the match in the 10th minute, receiving a through ball from Di María while unmarked in the penalty area. In the final match of the group stage, against Bolivia, Argentina won 4–1 to take first place in Group A. Papu Gómez opened the scoring with a short volley from inside the penalty area in the 6th minute. Messi, who had assisted Gómez's goal, added a pair of his own with a converted penalty in the 33rd minute and chipping goalkeeper Carlos Lampe from outside the box in the 42nd minute. Bolivia earned a consolation goal in the 60th minute through Erwin Saavedra, but Argentina restored their three-goal lead with a tap-in from Lautaro Martínez five minutes later.\nArgentina played Ecuador, Group B's fourth-place finisher, in the quarter-finals to open the knockout stage. Messi was involved in all three of Argentina's goals in their 3–0 victory, with assists for Rodrigo De Paul in the 40th minute and Lautaro Martínez in the 84th minute before scoring a curling free kick of his own in stoppage time. The semi-final fixture against Colombia began with an early goal for Martínez in the seventh minute, but finished 1–1 in regulation time after an equaliser from Luis Díaz in the 61st minute. In the ensuing penalty shoot-out, Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez saved three shots to give the team a 3–2 win after five rounds. The match featured 10 yellow cards and 47 fouls, both setting records for the Copa América.\nBrazil.\nBrazil had the third-most Copa América titles, at nine, and were defending their 2019 title. The team was drawn into Group B alongside original co-hosts Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, and invitees Qatar until their withdrawal. Manager Tite called up a majority of the players used in 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying for much of 2020 and 2021, led by captain Thiago Silva and star forward Neymar. Despite a rumoured boycott reported in several newspapers, the Brazil squad agreed to play in the tournament but criticised CONMEBOL for its organisation of the Copa América in the country amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Seleção opened their title defense with a 3–0 victory against Venezuela, who had 15 emergency call-ups to replace players who had tested positive for COVID-19. Marquinhos scored in the 23rd minute to open the match and was followed by a penalty from Neymar in the 64th minute and a chested tap-in from Gabriel Barbosa in the 89th minute. Brazil followed with a 4–0 win over Peru in their second match, including three goals in the second half, to earn an early berth in the knockout stage. Alex Sandro opened the scoring in the 12th minute and was followed by Neymar in the 68th minute, Éverton Ribeiro in the 89th minute, and Richarlison in stoppage time.\nColombia took an early lead against Brazil in their third match through a 10th-minute bicycle kick scored by Luis Díaz, but the Seleção earned a 2–1 comeback victory through headers from Roberto Firmino in the 78th minute and Casemiro in the tenth minute of stoppage time. Firmino's equaliser was the subject of protests from Colombia due to the ball hitting the referee earlier in the sequence, but was ruled valid by the video assistant referee. Brazil's winning streak was ended at ten matches after a 1–1 draw with Ecuador to close out the group stage, finishing atop Group B while resting several starting players. A 37th-minute header from Éder Militão, scoring his first international goal, gave Brazil a half-time lead, but substitute Ángel Mena equalised for Ecuador in the 53rd minute with a strike after a corner kick failed to be cleared.\nBrazil were held to a scoreless first half in their quarter-finals fixture against Chile, but broke through with a 46th-minute strike from half-time substitute Lucas Paquetá. Two minutes later, the team lost Gabriel Jesus to a red card after a high kick to the face of Eugenio Mena, but Brazil kept a shutout to win 1–0. The semi-final fixture against Peru marked a rematch from the group stage and the 2019 final for the Seleção. The match ended in a 1–0 victory for Brazil, with the lone goal scored by Paquetá in the 35th minute after Neymar dribbled past three defenders to provide an assist.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe match began after a minute of silence for victims of the COVID-19 pandemic, with Argentina leading in possession and early chances. Brazilian midfielder Fred received a yellow card in the third minute for a challenge on Gonzalo Montiel, beginning a series of fouls from players on both teams. Ángel Di María opened the scoring for Argentina in the 22nd minute, receiving a long pass from Rodrigo De Paul and beating defender Renan Lodi to lob the ball over the advancing goalkeeper Ederson. Brazil responded with a series of attacks, including one that forced a save out of Emiliano Martínez, but lost possession to an Argentina counter-attack that ended in a missed shot from Lionel Messi after the half-hour mark. The first half ended with a 1–0 lead for Argentina.\nBrazil manager Tite replaced Fred with attacking midfielder Roberto Firmino to begin the second half in search of an equaliser. Di María's attempt to extend Argentina's lead in the 50th minute was blocked and led to a Brazilian counterattack through Neymar that was suppressed by a foul by Giovani Lo Celso, who received a yellow card. Richarlison appeared to have equalised for Brazil with a shot from inside the penalty area in the 52nd minute that was ruled offside; he followed up a minute later with another strike that was saved by Martínez. Nicolás Otamendi was shown a yellow card in the 81st minute for a foul on Neymar, which triggered arguments and a shoving match between both sides. After a pair of chances for Brazil that were repelled by Martínez, Argentina sprung on a counterattack in the 88th minute that ended with Messi stumbling while trying to dribble around Ederson. The match ended in a 1–0 victory for Argentina, securing their first Copa América title since 1993.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules\nPost-match.\nArgentina won their 15th Copa América, tying Uruguay for the all-time record in the tournament, after finishing as runners-up in four editions since their last title in 1993. It was also the first senior international trophy won by Lionel Messi, who had led Argentina to three Copa América finals and the 2014 FIFA World Cup final, also played at the Maracanã. Di María was named the man of the match, while Messi was named the best player of the tournament and shared the top goalscorer award with Luis Díaz of Colombia. Martínez was named the tournament's best goalkeeper.\nWith the match's result, Argentina continued its unbeaten streak, which reached 20 matches, while Brazil had their first competitive defeat since 2018. After the match, manager Tite criticised the organisation of the Copa América and described the final as \"stop-start\" with \"anti-football\" preventing Brazil from playing well."

        "text": "The Basketball Tournament 2020 was the seventh edition of The Basketball Tournament (TBT), a 5-on-5, single elimination basketball tournament. The tournament, involving 24 teams, started on July 4 and continued through the championship game on July 14, with all games held at Nationwide Arena in Columbus, Ohio. The winner of the final, Golden Eagles, received a $1 million prize.\nFormat.\nInitial plans for TBT 2020 called for a field of 64 teams, organized into eight regions of 8 teams, all of which would be seeded. Each regional in the 2019 edition was hosted by a competing team, with the winner of each regional received a prize equal to 25% of that region's ticket proceeds, although it was unclear whether this procedure was slated to continue in 2020. The open entry period was set as March 15 to June 15.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was announced on June 11 that the start of the event would be moved up to July 4 in a modified form, with the entire tournament taking place at Nationwide Arena in Columbus, Ohio, and downsized to 24 teams with a $1,000,000 purse. It marked the first televised basketball event held in the United States since the onset of the pandemic and the suspension of all U.S. professional sports in mid-March, as the NBA did not plan to resume its 2019–20 season until July 31 (with all games hosted by the ESPN Wide World of Sports complex in Orlando, Florida). TBT 2020 organizers put extensive quarantine and testing protocols in place, including the immediate disqualification of any team that had a player test positive. Games were broadcast via ESPN networks (with ESPN having also announced a renewal of its media rights to the tournament), and closed to the public. State governor Mike DeWine considered the event \"another step forward in our state's efforts to responsibly restart Ohio\".\nAs with previous years, all tournament games operated with the \"Elam Ending\", a format of ending the game without the use of a game clock. Under the Elam Ending, the clock is turned off at the first dead-ball whistle with under four minutes to play in the game. At that time, a target score, equal to the score of the leading team plus eight, is set, and the first team to reach this target score is declared the winner of the game. Thus, all games end on a made basket (field goal or free throw) and there is no overtime.\nTeams.\nMultiple teams in the tournament were expected to be comprised mostly or exclusively of alumni of a particular school, program, or a group of closely related schools. As early as October 2019, Florida State had announced plans to enter a team, and St. Bonaventure and Virginia Tech had also announced the same by the end of 2019. In January 2020, Purdue also announced plans to enter a team. By the end of February 2020, Alabama, Illinois, Marshall, Maryland, Oklahoma State, and Virginia had also announced plans to enter TBT 2020. The status of defending champion Carmen's Crew (Ohio State) was initially uncertain; the team did officially enter by early March. Other alumni teams confirmed included Syracuse, West Virginia, and Wichita State. Additionally, Luke Hancock announced that he was exploring entering a Louisville alumni team.\nUltimately, alumni teams from Clemson, Dayton, Illinois, Marquette, Marshall, Ohio State, Oklahoma State, Purdue, Syracuse, and West Virginia were entered, along with teams representing the Big Ten and Mid-American (MAC) conferences. The remaining fifteen teams were not associated with a specific school or conference. The teams representing West Virginia and the MAC would later withdraw, due to each having a player test positive for COVID-19.\nThe tournament bracket was released on June 16, 2020.\nKey: \nReplacements.\nTournament organizers announced that any team that had a player test positive for COVID-19 would be immediately disqualified and removed from the tournament. Five teams had positive tests; all five were removed before playing in the tournament. Four of the teams were replaced, with the final removal, that of Eberlein Drive, resulting in another team being awarded a walkover.\nChampionship game statistics.\nStatistics for the title game are below. The championship basket (reaching the Elam Ending target score) was made by Travis Diener.\nCoach: Joe Chapman\nInactive: Andrew Rowsey\nCoach: Charles Parker&lt;br&gt;\nAsst: Jordan Griffith\nInactive: Diamond Stone\nAwards.\nSource: "

The team was unable to play a single game in either 1916 or 1917 and while a group of students did manage to play four games during the 1917–18 season, it was done informally and not as representatives of Columbia University. In 1920 an effort was made to revive the team and the 181st Street Ice Palace was secured as a practice facility. Once enough interest had been demonstrated and a team was formed, manager A. L. Walker Jr. put together a tentative schedule.\nColumbia opened its season against Yale and, unsurprisingly for a team that hadn't played in six seasons, lost 5–7. The Lions took more than two weeks to play their next game and, once they did, they found themselves on a sheet of ice nearly double the size of their practice rink. In their game against Williams the team began well, leading 1–0 after the first, but slumped badly in the middle frame, allowing 5 goals and losing any chance they had at winning their first game of the season.\nAfter letting another early lead slip away against Cornell a lineup change seemed to give Columbia the spark they needed and the Lions mauled Colgate 11–3, winning their first game in over six years.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The PBA World Series of Bowling (WSOB) is an annual multi-tournament ten-pin bowling event held by the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) in North America.\nFormation.\nThe inaugural World Series of Bowling event was held by the PBA at the start of the PBA Tour season (August 2 through September 6, 2009), and took place in the Detroit, Michigan suburbs of Allen Park and Taylor. Part of the reason for developing the World Series, given the U.S. economic recession at the time, was to consolidate multiple tournaments into one location to save on travel and broadcast crew costs. The World Series included five “animal pattern” tournaments (Cheetah, Viper, Chameleon, Scorpion and Shark), each named for a custom lane-oiling pattern. All of the animal pattern tournaments took place in Allen Park's Thunderbowl Lanes. A stand-alone tournament at nearby Taylor Lanes, the Motor City Open, was also considered part of the inaugural World Series of Bowling. In addition to being stand-alone title tournaments, the animal pattern events served as initial qualifying for that season's PBA World Championship major. While television tapings for the final rounds of the Motor City Open and all five animal pattern tournaments took place September 5 and 6, the PBA World Championship finals were not held until December 13, 2009 in Wichita, Kansas.\nHistory.\nWorld Series of Bowling II moved to Las Vegas for the . The event had five animal oil pattern events, with the PBA World Championship again running in a split format (qualifying in late October through early November, 2010, with the final rounds on January 14–16, 2011). Subsequent events ran only four or three animal pattern tournaments, but continued to use these events as initial qualifying for the PBA World Championship. After being held in Las Vegas for the next four years, the event moved to Reno, Nevada for three consecutive seasons.\nThe World Series of Bowling has run every PBA season since its inception, except for . After Fox Sports acquired the PBA television rights earlier that year, the decision was made to move the World Series to a spring event so it would be included in Fox's TV schedule. Thus, World Series of Bowling X was moved from late 2018 to March 2019, and was held in its original home of Allen Park, MI.\nBowlers from over 30 countries have participated in the World Series of Bowling. PBA Commissioner Tom Clark, who helped launch the event as Deputy Commissioner in 2009, has credited the WSOB with inspiring an influx of international players who now regularly compete on the PBA Tour.\nTournament formats and qualifying have changed over the years. For the 2023 season, the WSOB has a maximum field of 96 entrants. Priority registration is given to the top 50 PBA players in 2022 season points, 20 international invitees not in the top 50, and up to 16 other PBA Tour title holders making up a maximum 86 priority entries. The other 10 entries come from an eight-game Pre-Tournament Qualifier (PTQ). If the number of priority entries is below 86, more spots are filled from the PTQ. All the bowlers will roll 20 games of qualifying, split into four blocks. The top five will advance to the traditional stepladder. After 60 total games of qualifying, the top 12 bowlers advance to the PBA World Championship Match Play rounds. \nEvent Results.\nWorld Series of Bowling I.\nDates: August 2–September 6, 2009 and December 13, 2009&lt;br&gt;\nLocation: Allen Park, MI, except where noted\nEvents:\nWorld Series of Bowling II.\nDates: October 25–November 6, 2010 and January 14–16, 2011&lt;br&gt;\nLocation: Las Vegas, Nevada\nEvents:\nWorld Series of Bowling III.\nDates: November 5–19, 2011&lt;br&gt;\nLocation: Las Vegas, Nevada\nEvents:\nNotes: WSOB III was the first and only World Series in which all events were won by players from outside North America.\nWorld Series of Bowling IV.\nDates: November 3–11, 2012&lt;br&gt;\nLocation: Las Vegas, Nevada\nEvents:\nWorld Series of Bowling V.\nDates: October 25–November 3, 2013&lt;br&gt;\nLocation: Las Vegas, Nevada\nEvents:\nWorld Series of Bowling VI.\nDates: October 25–November 2, 2014&lt;br&gt;\nLocation: Las Vegas, Nevada\nEvents:\nWorld Series of Bowling VII.\nDates: December 8–19, 2015&lt;br&gt;\nLocation: Reno, Nevada\nEvents:\nWorld Series of Bowling VIII.\nDates: November 29–December 11, 2016&lt;br&gt;\nLocation: Reno, Nevada\nEvents:\nWorld Series of Bowling IX.\nDates: November 8–19, 2017&lt;br&gt;\nLocation: Reno, Nevada\nEvents:\nWorld Series of Bowling X.\nDates: March 12–21, 2019&lt;br&gt;\nLocation: Allen Park, Michigan\nEvents:\nWorld Series of Bowling XI.\nDates: March 6–15, 2020 &amp; October 1–5, 2020&lt;br&gt;\nLocation: Las Vegas, Nevada &amp; Centreville, Virginia\nThe PBA's World Series of Bowling XI. which includes three standard PBA title events and the PBA World Championship, was scheduled to take place March 6–18, 2020 in Las Vegas, with live finals broadcasts occurring across four consecutive days on FS1 (one Sunday afternoon broadcast on March 15, followed by three prime time evening broadcasts on March 16–18).

Shortly after the final cuts were announced and the lineup for the team was announce the team encountered a sizeable problem. The IHA had held a meeting regarding player eligibility (no freshman and only three years of eligibility in league games) to which Columbia could not immediately agree. The Columbia representative referred the matter to his faculty committee and the team would continue to play its IHA schedule in the interim. The operators of the St. Nicholas Rink, however, decided that since the matter had not been settled Columbia's place in the IHA was not stable enough to allow the team to practice at the rink. While Columbia choose to play games against the IHA opponents regardless of their place in the league, the Columbia athletic committee decided to uphold its own eligibility requirements (four years of eligibility) regardless of what the IHA rules were. After a resolution could not be reached, Columbia left the IHA in mid-December. Fortunately, despite resigning from the IHA, the St. Nicholas rink did become available for the team afterwards. J. S. Bates, due to being ineligible for intercollegiate games, turned over captaincy of the team to F. N. Bangs.\nAfter the upheaval in December, Columbia began its season on a low note, losing 0–6 to Yale with many of the previous season's players not appearing. After a game against Saegkill Golf Club was postponed due to no ice, Columbia attempted to produce a schedule on the fly. Unfortunately, all members of the IHA refused to schedule any games against the Lions, leaving Columbia with few opportunities. The match against Saegkill was played in early February with the Lions narrowly falling 6–7 in double overtime.

        "text": "The 1915–16 Princeton Tigers men's ice hockey season was the 17th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nWith many returning members, including team captain Grant Peacock, Princeton had high hoped for their season. Before it even began, however, the team received unwelcome news when the operators of the St. Nicholas Rink, still the principle arena for the university's teams, refused to allow the freshman squad to use the venue for either games or practices as they weren't expected to attract enough spectators to offset the cost. As a result, the freshman team was abandoned for the year. Despite the decision, Princeton's varsity squad was rounding into form towards the end of December and looked to be a challenger for the collegiate title.\nThe team began well, winning their first three games and taking two of three from Yale during their trip to Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, second-leading scorer Willian Humphreys was injured during the series. While Princeton managed to defeat Dartmouth in their next game the team was criticized for over-passing. Their second game of the Intercollegiate league turned out worse as Harvard used the large size of the Boston Arena to their advantage and shut out the Tigers 3–0.\nThe Tigers recovered with a win against an improving Yale squad but lost any chance they had at the title when Harvard won the second game. The contest was odd in that two 5-minute overtime periods were played with Harvard scoring in both extra sessions. The next game against Cornell was cancelled, leaving the team with a long layoff before their final match against Yale. While their season had not shaped up like they were hoping, there was good news for the program; the ice hockey team was making money. The Princeton athletic department reported that only three of its programs were not costing the university: football, baseball and ice hockey. The ice hockey team turned in profit of $186 for the 1914–15 season compared to a drain of $683 the year before. While the profits were small, the fact that Princeton could still draw during a disappointing season meant that the school would be likely to continue supporting the team unlike fellow schools Brown and Columbia.\nPrinceton was hoping to end their season with a victory over the Elis but Yale had other ideas. With Ford ineligible to play, the Bulldogs took the rematch and then claimed the series with a second win three night later, handing the Tigers another disappointing finish.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

He played as a centre and half-back.\nIn 1895, whilst noting Scott's resemblance to Tom Scott—the Scotland international forward of the same name—as a 'dead snip' when the back was still uncapped, the \"Glasgow Evening Post\" went on to state that Gedge, Gowans and Scott were unexcelled as the best half-backs in Britain.\nOccasionally Scott went by the initials 'T. L. S.'. Scott himself said this happened to differentiate between himself and the other Tom Scott of Melrose when both were Scotland internationals (Tom Scott of Melrose was 'T. M. S.'—his middle name was Monro) but this was not strictly true. It was discovered that the rugby commentator Argus Junior of \"The Hawick Express\" referred to Tom 'Langholm' Scott and Tom 'Melrose' Scott to differentiate the players in his rugby column.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nHe played for Langholm and then Hawick.\nProvincial career.\nHe played for South of Scotland against Cumberland in 1894.\nInternational career.\nHe was capped 11 times for Scotland from 1896 to 1900.\nAdministrative career.\nFor the 1914–15 season he was President of the Scottish Rugby Union. The First World War intervened; so no other elections were held. When the war finished Scott was elected for another term 1919 to 20. Effectively then, Scott held the post of President from 1914 to 1920, and this was the longest term in office of any President of the Union.\nDeath.\nAs a mark of respect in the wake of Scott's death, it was noted that Langholm players wore black arm bands when playing in the Hawick Sevens of 19 April 1947.\nFamily.\nHis brother James Alexander Scott played for Langholm and was capped by South of Scotland District in 1898."

        "title": "Equestrian at the 1968 Summer Olympics – Individual jumping",
        "text": "The individual show jumping at the 1968 Summer Olympics took place on 23 October. The event was open to men and women. There were 42 competitors from 15 nations. Each nation was limited to three riders. The event was won by William Steinkraus of the United States, the nation's first medal in individual jumping. Marion Coakes of Great Britain was the first female rider to win a medal in individual jumping, taking silver. Great Britain also earned its third consecutive bronze medal in the event, with David Broome earning his second (after 1960) to become the fifth person to win multiple medals in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the 13th appearance of the event, which had first been held at the 1900 Summer Olympics and has been held at every Summer Olympics at which equestrian sports have been featured (that is, excluding 1896, 1904, and 1908). It is the oldest event on the current programme, the only one that was held in 1900. The team and individual results were once again separated; they had been combined from 1924 to 1956, separate in 1960, and combined again in 1964.\nSix of the top 10 riders from the 1964 competition returned: two-time (1952 and 1964) gold medalist Pierre Jonquères d'Oriola of France, fourth-place finisher John Fahey of Australia, fifth-place finisher Nelson Pessoa of Brazil, seventh-place finisher Frank Chapot of the United States, ninth-place finisher Piero D'Inzeo of Italy, and tenth-place finisher Max Hauri of Switzerland. Also returning was D'Inzeo's brother Raimondo D'Inzeo. Raimondo had won the 1960 gold and 1956 silver medals; Piero had won the 1960 silver and 1956 bronze medals. The brothers were competing in their sixth Olympics; they would be the first to reach eight Games. Jonquères d'Oriola was competing in his fifth. Hans Günter Winkler, who had competed three times for the United Team of Germany and won gold in 1956, was also in Mexico City and now competing for West Germany. The reigning World Champion, who had also earned Olympic bronze in 1960, was David Broome of Great Britain. Thus, the field included the last four Olympic gold medalists (Jonquères d'Oriola, Winkler, R. D'Inzeo, and Jonquères d'Oriola again) and last six World Champions (Winkler twice, R. D'Inzeo twice, Jonquères d'Oriola, and Broome).\nBolivia, Canada, and West Germany each made their debut in the event. France competed for the 12th time, most of any nation, having missed the individual jumping only in 1932.\nCompetition format.\nThere were two rounds, as had been the case since 1952, but the format had been tweaked. Instead of two rounds on the same course, now there were two different courses. Moreover, instead of all riders who finished the first round competing again, now only the top 18 riders (or all riders with 8 or fewer faults, if there were more than 18) advanced to the second round. The first course was 750 metres long; the second was a more puissance-styled course of 410 metres. The total score from both rounds determined final rankings. There was a jump-off for the bronze medal, with the time in the jump-off used as a tie-breaker if riders were still tied (as all were). The jump-off course was 370 metres.\nResults.\n42 riders competed. Broome's horse Mr. Softee would later appear in the \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" episode \"Archaeology Today\" \"Trailer sketch\" in 1970, though Anneli Drummond-Hay was riding the horse rather than Broome. All four of the riders in the jump-off completed the course cleanly, so time was the deciding factor."

        "title": "1919–20 Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1919–20 Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey season was the 22nd season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAfter a successful return in 1919, the hockey team had high hopes for a return to glory in the first full season since the end of World War I. First, however, they would have to overcome a few difficulties. Alfred Winsor, the coach who had instilled a tremendous defensive system and led the team to 7 intercollegiate championships, would not return to the program. The team decided to hire another Crimson grad with William Henry Claflin Jr. becoming the second coach in team history. Secondly, with the Boston Arena still undergoing repairs due to a fire, the university would have to find a new home for the year. With the St. Nicholas Rink now closed for hockey and the opening of the Philadelphia Ice Palace delayed, Harvard was able to secure the small Cambridge Ice Pavilion for many of its early games.\nDue to the small size of the rink, all games that took place there were restricted to six players on each side, rather than the normal seven for college games. Additionally, many of the game were played using three 15-minute periods rather than two 20-minute halves. The changes known well ahead of time but the team may still have been put off by the strangeness in their games because the Crimson lost the first three games of their season. Fortunately, none were to other colleges and when they opened the inaugural Triangular Hockey League season against Yale, Harvard was able to overcome a 3-goal middle frame from the Elis with one of their own in the third to win the game 5–4. The next game against the Dartmouth Club saw a return to 20-minute halves, but the match progressed similarly with the opponents building a multi-goal lead that Harvard was just able to overcome and claim victory.\nThree nights later Harvard downed the official team from Dartmouth and were beginning to get used to the style of play necessitated by the size of the Pavilion. By the time Harvard played Tufts they had rounded into form and dominated the Jumbos 8–0 while using their alternates for most of the game. The offensive heart of the team, Edward Bigelow, returned from an injury just in time for the first game against Princeton. After the Tigers opened the scoring, Bigelow tied the game and set up an offensive deluge that resulted in a 4–1 lead after the first period. The teams played tighter in the final two frames but Harvard's defense was up to the task and the Crimson responded to every Tiger goal to take the game by a final score of 6–3.\nA 5-goal game from Bigelow paced the team in their 8–0 win over MIT But the team was far more impressive in their 4–3 win over the Boston All Stars. Even with several fluky goals, and a bit of controversy over the game-winner, Harvard was able to run their winning streak to 7 games at the end of the most strenuous stretch of their season. Harvard won one more home game before preparing to head south and play Yale at the Philadelphia Ice Palace.\nWith the game played on a surface even larger than modern Olympic rinks, Harvard was dominant throughout the game, their first 7-on-7 match of the season. Only through the brilliant goaltending of Walker was Harvard's score limited to 3 goals. The win gave the season series to Harvard as well as the intercollegiate championship. The Crimson still had to finish their series with Princeton, but the Tigers' record was so poor that even if they were to win the series Harvard would still possess the crown for 1920. In the end, however, Princeton proved no match for Harvard and the Crimson were able to post their biggest victory over the Tigers to that point with a 10–1 win. Captain Walker left the game late with a broken nose but that minor injury couldn't detract from the overpowering performance that cemented Harvard's ninth Intercollegiate Championship.\nHarvard was reported as both the Intercollegiate Champion and Eastern Intercollegiate Champion at the time. While the midwestern schools had just begun their programs and they would not regularly play the eastern teams for several years, none played more than a handful of games and most matches were not intercollegiate contests. This left Harvard with a claim for a unified National Championship, the last such claim until 1948.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"
