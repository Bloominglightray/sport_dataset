        "text": "Top Esports, previously known as Topsports Gaming, is a Chinese esports organization. Its \"League of Legends\" team competes in the \"League of Legends\" Pro League (LPL), the top-level league for the game in China. It was founded on 21 December 2017 by athletic apparel company Topsports.\nHistory.\nThe Topsports Gaming brand was unveiled on 21 December 2017 by athletic apparel company Topsports, which had acquired the LPL spot of DAN Gaming. The team's first tournament was the 2017 Demacia Championship, where they placed ninth to fifteenth after losing in the third round to Suning Gaming.\nTopsports was a member of the LPL's eastern conference during the 2018 spring season, placing seventh with a 3–16 record. For the 2018 summer season, Topsports was moved to the western conference where they placed third with a 10–9 record, qualifying for playoffs. The team lost in the first round to Royal Never Give Up. Topsports was one of eight teams that participated in the 2018 National Electronic Sports Tournament (NEST 2018), placing second after losing to JD Gaming in the finals. This result qualified Topsports for the 2018 Demacia Cup winter season, where they placed second again after losing to Invictus Gaming in the finals.\nDuring the offseason before the 2019 LPL Spring Split Topsports changed up their main roster, which became top laner Bai \"369\" Jiahao, jungler Xiong \"Xx\" Yulong, mid laner Zhuo \"Knight\" Ding, bot laner Lee \"LokeN\" Dong-wook, and support Nam \"Ben\" Dong-hyun. The team finished third in the regular season with an 11–4 record and 4th in playoffs after losing to Invictus Gaming in the semifinals and FunPlus Phoenix in the third place match. At NEST 2019, Topsports fielded their trainee roster and placed fifth to eighth after losing to Edward Gaming in the quarterfinals.\nOn 15 May 2019, it was announced that Topsports Gaming had renamed to Top Esports. Top Esports placed second in the regular season of the 2019 LPL Summer Split and third in playoffs after winning the third-place match against Bilibili Gaming. The team was unable to qualify for the 2019 World Championship after narrowly losing to Invictus Gaming in the last round of the regional finals. Xx left the team on 15 December 2019 and was replaced by LMS veteran Hung \"Karsa\" Hao-hsuan. Ben and LokeN followed suit shortly after, and were replaced with Zhang \"QiuQiu\" Ming and Liang \"yuyanjia\" Jiayuan, and Ying \"Photic\" Qishen respectively. Top Esports lost to Vici Gaming in the 2019 Demacia Cup semifinals and placed fifth to eighth.\nDuring the 2020 LPL Spring Split regular season, Top Esports experimented between QiuQiu and yuyanjia in the support role and originally intended to start former Invictus Gaming player and world champion Yu \"JackeyLove\" Wenbo as their bot laner. However, due to the length of JackeyLove's contract, he was unable to play until near the end of the regular season, with Photic maintaining his role as Top Esports' starting bot laner until then. Nonetheless, Top Esports finished fourth in the regular season with an 11–5 record. After defeating Team WE and Invictus Gaming in the quarterfinals and semifinals respectively, Top Esports made it to their first LPL finals. After a close series, Top Esports lost to JD Gaming and finished runners-up.\nDue to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the annual Mid-Season Invitational was cancelled for 2020 and replaced by the Mid-Season Streamathon, an online live stream event featuring several tournaments and show matches. One of the online tournaments held was the Mid-Season Cup, featuring the top four teams from the LPL and LCK. Top Esports was drafted into Group A along with FunPlus Phoenix, DAMWON Gaming, and T1. The team finished second in their group, advancing to the knockout stage. In the semifinals, Top Esports swept Gen.G, moving on to the finals where they defeated FunPlus Phoenix to claim the Mid-Season Cup.\nTop Esports did not make any roster changes going into the 2020 LPL Summer Split, although they did experiment with QiuQiu in the bot lane. The team finished first in the regular season and received a bye to the semifinals, where they swept Suning. After another close series against JD Gaming in the finals, Top Esports managed to defeat their longtime rivals, claiming their first LPL title and qualifying for the 2020 World Championship as the LPL's first seed.\nFor the main event group stage of the 2020 World Championship, Top Esports was drafted into Group D along with South Korean team DRX, North American team FlyQuest, and Russian team Unicorns of Love."

        "text": "United States v Iran, played on 21 June 1998, was a football match between Iran and the United States in the group stage of the 1998 FIFA World Cup at the Stade de Gerland in Lyon, France. The match, which is described as the \"mother of all games\" and the \"most politically charged game in World Cup history\", ended with a 2–1 victory for Iran, the team's first ever victory in the history of the FIFA World Cup.\nHamid Estili and Mehdi Mahdavikia scored for Iran, while Brian McBride scored for the United States.\nBackground.\nSince the overthrow of the democratically elected (see 1953 Iranian coup d'état for more details) Prime Minister of Iran, Mohammad Mosaddegh by the US and the UK, due to his policy to nationalize Iran's oil industry, and the American support for Iraq, and the US killing of all 290 Iranian passengers on Iran Air Flight 655, relations between the two countries had been hostile.\nAccording to FIFA regulations, teams in each match are classified as team A or team B. Team B, Iran in this match, typically walks towards team A for the pre-match handshakes. The supreme leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, \"gave express orders that the Iranian team must not walk towards the Americans\". Mehrdad Masoudi, one of the FIFA media officers of the match, negotiated with the US team, and as a result, the Americans walked towards the Iranians.\nDuring a delicately choreographed pregame ceremony, the Iranian players gifted white roses to their American opponents as a symbol of peace.\nAftermath.\nA major upset, the match was described by \"The New York Times\" as an \"historic victory\" for Iran. Although the Iranian government took steps to reign in celebrations after the countrywide uproar when Iran qualified for the World Cup, thousands of fans publicly reveled in Tehran, including women without headscarves.\nThe resignation of Sampson has been partially attributed to the match, as some American players alleged that poor team management led to the loss.\nThe match had a profound impact on the career of Iranian-American Afshin Ghotbi, who was working as part of the technical staff of the USMNT. The emotional game between the United States and Iran persuaded Afshin into entering the path as a football coach, ultimately went on to take charge of the Iranian national team from 2009 to 2011, the first American to coach Iran.\nJeff Agoos, a former US defender, said that \"We did more in 90 minutes than the politicians did in 20 years.\" Eighteen months later, the teams played a friendly match at Pasadena just outside of Los Angeles, home to the largest population of Iranian Americans outside Iran. The game finished in a 1–1 draw.\nAs Germany drew with Yugoslavia in the earlier group match and both finished with four points after two matches, the United States were eliminated from reaching the knockout stage after losing to Iran. Iran lost to Germany and were therefore eliminated as well, while the United States lost their final group match to Yugoslavia.\n2022 FIFA World Cup rematch.\nIran and the United States met again at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar on 29 November 2022, in their final match of Group B. The United States, who faced elimination with failing to win, defeated Iran 1–0 by a lone goal from Christian Pulisic, advancing to the round of 16 and eliminating Iran."

The field for the Derby is limited to 20 horses, with up to four 'also eligibles' in case of a late withdrawal from the field. There are three separate paths for horses to take to qualify for the Derby: the main Road consisting of races in North America (plus one in Dubai), the Japan Road consisting of four races in Japan, and the European Road with seven European races in England, Ireland and France. The top four finishers in the specified races receive points, with higher points awarded in the major prep races. Earnings in non-restricted stakes races act as a tie breaker.\nWhen originally announced in September 2019, the main Road to the Kentucky Derby would have remained substantially the same as the 2019 Road to the Kentucky Derby, consisting of 35 races, 19 races for the Kentucky Derby Prep Season and 16 races for the Kentucky Derby Championship Season. Fair Grounds Race Course subsequently made minor changes to the length of the three qualifying races that it hosts: the Lecomte Stakes goes from a mile and 70 yards to miles, the Risen Star from to miles, and the Louisiana Derby goes from to miles. However, in March 2020, the growing coronavirus pandemic prompted the cancellation of several prep races, and the rescheduling of the Derby itself.

        "title": "1924 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1924 season of Auckland Rugby League was its 15th. Marist won the first grade championship for the first time in their history after defeating Devonport in the final by 20 points to 17 in front of a club record crowd of 17,000 at Carlaw Park. While City won the Roope Rooster competition for the 4th time.\n \n \nNews.\nFirst grade competition.\nAt a Management Committee meeting on 9 April, the Mangere United team, and Ellerslie clubs who had requested to enter senior teams in the First Grade competition were accepted, bringing the total number of teams to nine. The Mangere team registered its colours and green and black. The suggested format was one where after the first round the top six teams would continue while the bottom three teams would have other matches arranged for them. However all nine teams remained in the grade until the end of the season. The Mangere United team was a combined team from the Manukau and Mangere clubs. Both clubs retained their own identity in the junior grades.\nOn the opening day of the season all four First Grade matches were played on Carlaw Park. The junior matches on the same day were postponed as the railway workers were on strike and there was no way for the players to reach the outer suburban grounds which were used for matches in these grades.\nLou Brown transfer issue.\nLou Brown, the New Zealand international had played for Newton Rangers in 1922 and 1923 however at the end of the season he moved to England to play for Wigan. He had been granted a release by Newton and New Zealand Rugby League. Upon his return he wished to play for the City Rovers club and he turned out for them despite being told by the Auckland Rugby League that he was not eligible to play for them. City were adamant that he had been fully released and could play for any team. The New Zealand Rugby League Council supported the decision but Brown played anyway. He was subsequently suspended for 3 matches. City took the extraordinary step of withdrawing its team from the competition and they defaulted their Round 9 match with Mangere United. On 18 July Newton held a special board meeting and agreed to grant Brown a transfer and thus the issue was finally settled.\nManukau Rovers club switches to rugby union.\nThe entire Manukau Rovers club switched to rugby union after a dispute with Auckland Rugby League. The issue arose after one of their players (King) was suspended for four playing Saturdays. He had been suspended because he was registered with the Manukau club but \"suddenly joined, or played, for the Māngere United team without having been granted a transfer\". An opposing team had protested and King had in the meantime moved back to the Manukau club. The Manukau club took exception to the decision and refused to play any of its six teams in the following grades: Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth A, and Sixth B. It then went a step further by switching the entire club to rugby union with the Auckland Rugby Union accepting them. The Secretary of the club, C.J, Williams disputed the way the ARL had handled the matter and several of the facts in a letter to the Auckland Star. The ARL Chairman, Mr. W. Hammill replied to the letter \"that the matters contained therein were hardly correct\".\nUnited Suburbs club formation.\nAt the Auckland Rugby League meeting of April 2 the affiliation of the United Suburbs club was approved. Their club colours were gold with a black badge. Two weeks later at the management committee meeting their colours were registered however they were now maroon and gold.\nNew Lynn club formation.\nA club was also formed at New Lynn in early March. They only lasted until around 1930 however and are not the present day New Lynn Stags club. They played around the Kelston area opposite the present day Kelston Shopping Centre, possibly at the site of present day Kelston Girls College. At their formation meeting the Auckland chairman, Mr. W.J. Hammill was present along with A. Powell from the New Zealand Council (rugby league). The following officers were elected:- Patron, hon. Christopher James Parr; vice patron, Mr. Albert Crum, senr.; president, Mr. C.F. Gardiner; secretary and delegate to the league, Mr. Colin Crum; treasurer, Mr. Mathieson; auditor, Mr. Ivan Culpan; management committee, Messrs. T. Brown and R. Brown, in addition to the chairman, secretary and treasurer. They decided to enter three teams in junior grades though ultimately fielded 2 sides in the 3rd and 5th grades. The Tahurangi/Crum Park in nearby Titirangi is named after Albert Crum who was a well known figure in the New Lynn pottery industry.\nGoals from marks.\nAt the ARL Management Committee meeting on 13 August, the Referee's Association reported that goals from marks would no longer be permitted. This rule would come into place from Saturday, 23 August onwards.\nMonteith Shield (1st grade championship).\nA record nine teams competed in the First Grade competition in 1924 with the addition of the Māngere United and Ellerslie senior teams. Mangere had their colours registered as green and black. It was initially decided that after the first round the bottom three teams would drop out of the competition for the second round. At the end of the first round these teams were Māngere United, and Ellerslie. However, this was later rescinded and all teams remained in the competition until the end of the season.\nMonteith Shield fixtures.\nRound 2.\nJim O'Brien debuted for Marist. He had previously played for the New Zealand national rugby team in 3 matches in 1922.\nRound 3.\nIn the match at Devonport Domain Ben Davidson was knocked unconscious and had to be taken to hospital. City had a bye the following weekend and he returned to play in Round 5. Neville St George and Alf Townsend were ordered off in the City match with Devonport. They were the two hookers and there had been issues with the scrum.\nRound 4.\nTwo matches were postponed in Round 4 as the league decided that they wanted the #1 field in the best possible condition for the exhibition match between City Rovers and Marist Old Boys of Christchurch. The weather had been particularly poor in the lead up with the previous weekend seeing all football in Auckland cancelled. These postponed matches were unique in that they were eventually played 10 days later on a Tuesday morning at 9.30am. This would surely be one of the only times a senior match had been played on a working weekday morning in the competitions history.\nRound 5.\nGeorge Gardiner debuted for Marist. He had played rugby union for the Māori Pioneer Battalion side in 1918-19 and for the Bay of Plenty rugby team. In rugby league he went on to represent Auckland 4 times and New Zealand 21 times on their 1926 tour of England. In the early 1930s he moved to Australia to emabark on a professional wrestling career. After the outbreak of World War 2 he enlisted but was killed fighting in Libya.\nRound 6.\nThe match played at Ellerslie Reserve between Richmond and Ellerslie was the first senior match played there since 1912.\nRound 7.\nReferee Bill Murray was refereeing his 50th first grade match in the clash between Devonport and Mangere at the Devonport Domain. He became only the second referee to achieve this feat after Archie Ferguson 2 years earlier. There was controversy in the match between City Rovers and Richmond as the City team fielded Lou Brown who had not been granted clearance by either Auckland Rugby League or New Zealand Rugby League. Brown had previously played for Newton and had been released to play for Wigan in England. After returning he wanted to turn out for the City club but Newton claimed that he had been released on the grounds that he would return to play for them alone. Brown was later suspended for 3 matches before rejoining the Newton team for their match against Marist.\nRound 8.\nThe match between Māngere and Ellerslie was the first ever rugby league match played at present day Ferguson Park in Onehunga.\nRound 9.\nCity defaulted their match against Mangere United in protest at the decision to not allow Lou Brown to register for the club after returning from England.\nRound 10.\nIn the Athletic match with Richmond, Graham was ordered off for Athletic as was McMillan for Richmond. Richmond had lost Whittington to an injury early in the second half and with the score 25–0 with 6 minutes to go they threw in the towel and the match ended.\nRound 15.\nThe win by City over Devonport was a competition milestone as it was City's 100th win in First Grade. They were the first club to achieve this milestone and did so in their 15th season and 149th game.\nRound 16.\nNear full-time in the match between Marist and Devonport, Kiwi international Bill Stormont was ordered off.\nIn the Newton match with Ponsonby a very unusual incident took place. L Williams for the Newton team was dribbling the ball down field and when he kicked ahead to chase, the ball went over the cross bar. He ran through to 'score the try' but the referee awarded a drop goal rather than a try.\nRound 17.\nIt is unlikely that the Māngere v Ponsonby match took place as the Auckland representative team was playing a match against the South Auckland team in Hamilton at the same time. Many of the selected players chose to stay and play for their Auckland club teams in important matches. The team that did end up playing in the representative match featured seven players from the Ponsonby and Māngere teams and there were no reports of a match between the two sides in any newspaper. A table published at the end of the season also only credited Māngere with 14 matches, not 15 which is what they would have played had the match taken place.\nFinal.\n Jack Kirwan debuted for Marist in the final. It was slightly controversial that a team in a significant match had signed and registered players midweek to play though not unprecedented. Many teams would debut prospective players later in the season and in particular they would trial (disgruntled) rugby players. Kirwan would go on to represent New Zealand and later serve on the Marist committee for many years. He scored a try in their narrow in, with Charles Gregory kicking 4 goals. For the losers Bert Laing scored a try and kicked 2 goals. Jack Kirwan's grandson John Kirwan played for the All Blacks in the 1980s and 90s. \nRoope Rooster knockout competition.\nCity Rovers won the Roope Rooster for the 4th time in their history, defeating Ponsonby who were attempting to win their third consecutive title, in the final by 6 points to 5.\nRound 2.\nRoy Hardgrave debuted for Newton. He went on to play 58 games for them, scoring 39 tries and kicking 6 goals before signing for St Helens R.F.C. in 1929. For St Helens he played 212 times and scored 173 tries. In 1934 he returned to Newton playing twice before joining Mt Albert for 2 matches. He then went back to England and played 89 games for York scoring 52 tries, and then joined Toulouse in France before once again returning to New Zealand. He then rejoined the Mt Albert side playing 22 games and scoring 1 tries before retiring. He later coached Newton Rangers from 1941 to 1943.\nTop try scorers and point scorers.\nThe lists include points scored in the First Grade competition and the Roope Rooster. Joe Hadley of Athletic led the league in tries scored with 12, while Craddock Dufty was once again the top scorer with 91 points from 9 tries, 29 conversions and 3 penalties.\nDevonport had a try and conversion unattributed in a match. While the match between Mangere United and Ellerslie won by Mangere United 18 to 10 had no points attributed to any player. It is possible that M Paul for Mangere scored more tries than the 9 he is credited with and more than the 3 goals he kicked.\nExhibition matches.\nCity Rovers played Marist of Christchurch at Carlaw Park in May and were victorious by 16 points to 9. At the end of the season Marist, who had won the First Grade Championship met City Rovers, who had won the Roope Rooster and the two teams played out a 10 all draw on Monday morning as part of the Labour Day celebrations to officially finish the season for Auckland Rugby League.\nLower grades.\nThere were 6 lower grade competitions in 1924 with the 6th grade split into an A and B division.\nSecond grade.\nOtahuhu Rovers won the competition after defeating Richmond Rovers 17-5 on September 6 in the final. Otahuhu had won the A Section and Richmond the B Section. The standings are incomplete with around 18 rounds being played. Athletic withdrew after 3 rounds, Marist and Ellerslie withdrew after 7 rounds, and the Manukau side withdrew when the Manukau board switched to rugby union in protest at a decision by Auckland Rugby League in July. Kingsland won the knockout final when they defeated Otahuhu 6 points to 3 on October 18.\nThird grade.\nCity Rovers won the competition after defeating Devonport United 12-2 on September 6 in the final. The standings are incomplete with 16 rounds being played but with most teams only having 3-5 results reported. City also won the knockout final on October 4 when they beat Athletic in the final 18-8. Marist were listed to play in round one but withdrew after that, Victoria Cruising Club also entered a team but had no fixtures after round 2, and Kingsland B also did not have any fixtures beyond round 2 so have not been included in the standings. Manukau withdrew in July after their boards decision to switch to rugby in protest at a transfer suspension of one of their players.\nFourth grade.\nThe competition was played over 14 rounds. Ponsonby United B won the championship after beating Richmond 10-8 in the final on August 30. Ponsonby B had won the A Section and Richmond the B Section. Parnell won the knockout final when they defeated Richmond 3-2 on October 11. City withdrew after 7 rounds, while Takapuna, and Māngere United, and withdrew after round 11 rounds. The Manukau side withdrew in July along with their entire club which switched codes to form the Manukau rugby side.\nFifth grade.\nPonsonby won the championship after Newton defaulted to them in round 20. Marist entered a team but withdrew either prior to or after one week. The 1949 Rugby League Annual written by Bill Davidson states that Athletic won the A Section and Ellerslie the B Section. Richmond won the B Section knockout when they defeated Maritime. Devonport withdrew after 2 rounds and have not been included in the standings, while Manukau withdrew along with the rest of their club which switched to rugby union in July. The majority of match results were not reported so the standings are very incomplete. In round 5 it was reported in both the Auckland Star and the New Zealand Herald that Newton had beaten Athletic 82-0.\nSixth grade A.\nAthletic won the championship when they beat City A 6-3 in the final on October 11. Two weeks prior City A defeated Athletic 5-3 in a 'semi-final' which forced the playoff for the championship. It had been Athletics only defeat of the season. Leys Institute scored their first try of the season in a 25-3 loss to Parnell on September 13.\nSixth grade B.\nEllerslie United finished with a 12 win 0 loss season to win the championship. They scored 125 points and conceded 33, and were managed by Mr E. Chapman, and J. Poland. Ellerslie and Richmond met in the knockout final on September 20 but the result was not reported. Ponsonby seemingly withdrew after 2 rounds so have not been included in the standings. Manukau withdrew along with all their other sides when they switched to rugby union midseason in protest.\nHouse matches.\nA series of house matches were played during the season between the following sides: \nRepresentative fixtures.\nErnie Asher, Edwin Fox, and Ronald MacDonald were appointed selectors for the season with Bill Davidson the coach and Henry Donovan the manager. Auckland played three matches against Australian Universities on 4, 7, and 14 June. In the first match Auckland defeated the University side by 15 to 7. In the second meeting Auckland again won, this time more easily by 17 points to 2. The visiting captain congratulated the Auckland team but made mention of the conditions by saying that “yours are certainly better wet day footballers than we are but this is to be expected when you realise that my club, Sydney University has not played on a wet ground since early in 1922 season”. They had their wish somewhat in the third match with much improved weather conditions and were able to come home strongly in the second half to draw the match 14–14 in front of 11,500 people.\nOn 26 July in front of 20,000 spectators the touring England side defeated Auckland by 24 points to 11. In the curtain-raisers Ellerslie Sixth Grade B defeated City Sixth Grade B by 5 points to 2, and City Second grade defeated their Richmond counterparts by 8 points to 7. On the Wednesday following, an Auckland provincial team featuring Auckland players from the greater region including the Waikato region played England and lost 28 to 13 in front of 7,000 spectators.\nOn 20 September an Auckland team played South Auckland in Hamilton and were defeated easily by 21 points to 5. The team was supposed to be a full strength Auckland team but as the club competition was entering its key stages many of the first team players remained behind to play for their clubs. As a result, many players from the struggling Newton team made the trip to Hamilton.\nAuckland v Australian Universities.\nFrank Delgrosso had to come on the replace George Davidson after he collided badly with teammate Clarrie Polson when they were both going after the ball. Polson received a bad cut over his eye and he also later had to retire and was replaced by Billy Ghent.\nAuckland B v Hamilton.\nWilson Hall broke his collar bone during the second half and had to leave the field. The Auckland B team consisted of Charles Gregory, M Paul, Hec Brisbane, Ivan Littlewood, Lyall Stewart, Wilson Hall, A Garrett, Wally Somers, Jim O'Brien (Devonport), Len Mason, Wilfred McNeil, John Shirley, and Bill Te Whata.\nAuckland v England.\nThere is film footage of the match taken by Tarr Film and archived on the New Zealand Archive of Film, television and Sound Ngā Taonga website. In scoring on halftime Ben Davidson was knocked out. At the start of the second half Auckland attempted to replace him with Lou Brown who ran out on to the field. However the England captain when seeing this objected as replacements were forbidden in the second half of rugby league matches at this time. Auckland were forced to play with 12 players for a time until Davidson recovered well enough to return to the field.\nAuckland Province v England.\nThe team was made entirely from Auckland 'city' players with the exception of Huatahi 'Brownie' Paki and B Johnson from the Waikato (South Auckland) competition. During the first half Paki was injured and replaced by Frank Delgrosso who scored a try after a passing movement. Paki had spent the 1923 season playing in Australia for St. George.\nAuckland representative matches played and scorers.\nThere were several members of the Lipscombe family playing for the Māngere club and it is unclear which of them played in the forwards for Auckland in their match with South Auckland on September 20."

        "title": "2019 Bianca Andreescu tennis season",
        "text": "The 2019 Bianca Andreescu tennis season officially began on December 31, 2018 with the start of the 2019 WTA Tour. She entered the season as No. 152 in the world.\nYear in detail.\nEarly hard court season.\nAuckland Open.\nAndreescu started her season at the Auckland Open, where she qualified for the main draw after beating Kristína Kučová, Jaimee Fourlis and Laura Siegemund. In the main draw, she made it to the final after defeating four top-30 players, including two former World No. 1 players, Caroline Wozniacki and Venus Williams. However, she lost to defending champion Julia Görges in three sets.\nAustralian Open.\nIn Melbourne, Andreescu successfully progressed through qualifying to enter the main draw. She then beat Whitney Osuigwe before losing in the second round to Anastasija Sevastova in three sets.\nNewport Beach.\nAndreescu played at the Newport Beach, where she was the sixth seed. Having received a bye in the first round, she then won the next five matches and secured her first ever WTA 125K series title, which elevated herself to the World No. 68.\nMexican Open.\nIn February, Andreescu played the Mexican Open, where she got to the semi-finals, losing to No. 5 seed Sofia Kenin in three sets. Nevertheless, her ranking climbed to a career-high 60.\nMarch sunshine events.\nIndian Wells Open.\nThis year's Indian Wells Premier Mandatory event proved to be her breakout event. By reaching the semi-finals, Andreescu became the third wild card to reach the semi-finals of the tournament, joining Grand Slam champions Serena Williams and Kim Clijsters. She then defeated two then top-ten players, Elina Svitolina and Angelique Kerber, to win her first WTA title. The victory also promoted the 19-year-old rising star to a new-career high ranking of 24.\nMiami Open.\nSeveral days later, Andreescu drew Begu in the first round again in Miami. She managed to save a match point and eventually won the match to reach the second round. In the second round, she avenged her Acapulco loss to Kenin to set up another meeting with Kerber. She upset Kerber in three sets once again, but she had to retire against Anett Kontaveit due to a right shoulder injury, ending her 10-match winning streak.\nEuropean clay court season.\nFrench Open.\nAfter a three-month-long recovery, Andreescu returned to the tennis court at the French Open, as the 22nd seed. However, she retired before her second round match against Kenin. She missed the entire grass-court season to recover from her shoulder injury.\nUS Open series.\nRogers Cup.\nAndreescu came back two months later in her home tournament, the 2019 Rogers Cup in Toronto, where she made to her third WTA final after defeating two former top-ten players, Eugenie Bouchard and Daria Kasatkina, and two then top-ten players, Kiki Bertens and Karolína Plíšková, all in three sets. In the semi-finals, she met Kenin for the third time this season, and successfully upset the American girl in two straight sets. Her final rival was the 23-time Grand Slam winner Serena Williams, but a tearful Williams retired when she was 1–3 down in the first set due to her own injury. This gave Bianca her second WTA title, and a career-high ranking of 14.\nUS Open.\nTwo weeks later, she was seeded 15th in the US Open. She made it to the second week of a Grand Slam without losing a set. In the fourth round, she outlasted local player Taylor Townsend to make her first quarter-final appearance in a Grand Slam. After downing Elise Mertens in three tough sets, she upset Belinda Bencic in two sets to reach her first Grand Slam final, where she faced Serena Williams once again. Andreescu beat Serena in straight sets, becoming the first Canadian to win a Grand Slam singles title, the first woman to win the US Open in her main draw debut (she previously lost in a qualifying round), and the first player born after 2000 to win a Grand Slam tournament. With the 2,000 points she won from the Grand Slam, she made her top-five debut.\nEast Asian fall swing.\nChina Open.\nHaving rested for near a month, Andreescu returned to court in the China Open, the tournament she never played before. She upset Aliaksandra Sasnovich, Elise Mertens and Jennifer Brady to reach quarterfinals, where her opponent was the former World No. 1 players Naomi Osaka. She eventually lost to the Japanese woman after three tough sets, ending her 17-match winning streak. Nevertheless, Andreescu was still qualified for the WTA Finals for the first time in her career.\nYear-end Championships.\nWTA Finals.\nAt the Year-end Championships, Andreescu was divided into the purple group, alongside Karolína Plíšková, Simona Halep and defending champion Elina Svitolina. The first round robin match against Halep marked the first-ever meeting between the two Romanian descendants. Despite having a match point, she was still edged by the 2019 Wimbledon Champion in three tough sets. In the second match against World No. 2 Plíšková, Andreescu retired after losing the opening set when she injured her knee. The injury ended her season a little bit earlier than expected as she withdrew from the tournament. Sofia Kenin later replaced her to complete the match against Svitolina.\nTournament schedule.\nSingles schedule.\nAndreescu's 2019 singles tournament schedule is as follows:\nDoubles schedule.\nAndreescu's 2019 doubles tournament schedule is as follows:\nYearly records.\nFinals.\nSingles: 4 (3 titles, 1 runner-up)"

        "text": "The Far North Coast Baseball Association (FNCBA) is the organising body for baseball on the Far North Coast of New South Wales.\nHistory.\nIn 1937, Laurie Thew, an aspiring right-handed pitcher from Sydney moved to Lismore and began efforts to establish baseball in the city. On 11 May 1937 a public notice was published in The Northern Star inviting interest in the formation of a 'Baseball Club', with the initial meeting taking place on Thursday 13 May 1937. Soon there were enough players for two teams and within weeks challenges were issued and representative games against Queensland based teams were being held. The first representative baseball game ever held in Lismore took place on Saturday 31 July 1937, Queensland vs Lismore, with the visitors winning 7-1 on the back of some brilliant pitching. The advent of World War II led to a hiatus and it was not until 1947 when Thew again proved the catalyst - calling a meeting to re-establish the league. Thew is now recognised as the “Father of Baseball” on the Far North Coast.\nInitially the FNCBA played on cricket grounds during the winter and as the league grew this caused pressure on the city to find a dedicated space for the sport. Since 1965 FNCBA has used dedicated fields at the Albert Park sporting complex in Lismore, with the main diamond now known as Baxter Field.\nFrom 1952, the FNCBA was affiliated with Baseball Queensland, but in August 2018 they moved to the NSW Country Baseball Association, under the banner of Baseball NSW.\nIn 2015, for the first time in the 78-year history of the FNCBA, an all-women's team competed - the Ballina Sharkettes.\nCurrently there are teams from clubs based in Ballina, Casino and several clubs (Easts, Marist Brothers, Norths and Workers) from Lismore. In the past there have also been clubs from Alstonville and Kyogle.\nThe Association has produced numerous Australian (men's and women's) representatives including Barry Wappett, Barry Pratt, Harold Crozier, Geoff Mould, Ray, Mark and Mat Buckley, Matt Gahan, Peter Gahan, Matt Gates, Adrian Meagher, Michael Nind, Karina Connors and James Linger. \nBarry Wappett (1956, Melbourne), Michael Nind (1988, Seoul), Mat Buckley (2000, Sydney) and Adrian Meagher (2000, Sydney) represented Australia at the Olympics. \nThe area remains one of the strongest centres for Baseball in Australia.\nHuckleberry Medal (Major League MVP).\nBeginning 1960, at the end of every season, the \"Huckleberry Medal\" has been awarded to the player deemed MVP in the FNCBA \"Major League\" competition. Past winners have been:\nIn addition to the list below, Peter Gahan (Marist Brothers) won the medal five-times in the 1970s-1980s."

        "text": "Cycling in the United States is a minor sport in the country. It is also a mode of transport, particularly in urban areas.\nAs a mode of transport.\nHistory.\nBicycling experienced a rise in popularity in the 21st century, as people sought to escape the congestion and reduce their environmental impact. Research shows that cycling is not only environmentally-friendly but is also beneficial to one's mental, physical, and social health. Activists and organizations such as the League of American Bicyclists campaigned for safer bicycle infrastructure. However, recent efforts to increase cycling in the United States have been insufficient, and the number of people who ride their bikes continues to plummet from 2014-2019.\nRecently, many American cities have started to promote cycling due to economic and educational opportunities, following what many European countries did in the past decades where they reclaimed space in the urban landscape from cars. National Geographic author Ilana Strauss suggests a direct correlation between perceived safety features like protected bike lanes and the amount of cyclists on the road.\nDemographics.\nAccording to a research article by Harry Oosterhuis, American cyclists' demographics mostly consist of men, students, and youngsters. Cycling advocates have asserted that low-income and minority communities also see a much lower percentage of cyclists due to the disproportionately low access to bicycle infrastructures.\nCulture.\nThe United States is generally considered as one of the least bicycle-friendly countries in the world. Compared to the Netherlands, where 27 percent of workers commute on a bike, America has an 1 percent of trips being completed on a bicycle. Many speculate that the lack of use of bicycles usage in the United States is because of the dominance of cars. However, some studies suggest that the socioeconomic and sociocultural characteristics of the United States are also contributing factors.\nRalph Buehler, John Pucher, and Adrian Bauman, authors of \"Journal of Transport &amp; Health,\" conducted a logistic regression research where they concluded the aforementioned factors are proven to be \"substantial\" when it comes to its impact on cycling. They concluded that women, children, and low-income communities are often ignored when new cycling facilities are being built.\nAnother article by Journal of Transport Geography suggests that this socioeconomic inequality regarding bicycle infrastructure is due to the belief of a higher demand for said infrastructure in dense and urban areas, which is generally linked to high-income, high-education communities. The authors also suggested a motivating factor of bicycle infrastructure development is its economic potential of returning highly educated Americans back to the cities.\nAs a sport.\nLance Armstrong was one of the United States' most successful cyclists.\nAyesha McGowan became the first African American female professional road cyclist. Major Taylor was the first African American world champion in cycling."

The first major tennis tournament was called the US Open Championship and was also first played in 1881.\nHistory.\nThe first tennis clubs in the United States were formed in the mid-1870s. Mary Ewing Outerbridge allegedly introduced the sport to the United States after seeing tennis being played in Bermuda and demonstrated it to people on Staten Island in 1874. Soon tennis clubs were established across the country amongst the upper classes, including in New Orleans and San Francisco. The New Orleans Lawn Tennis Club was founded in December, 1876.\nIn 1887 the Philadelphia Cricket Club, hosted a National singles Championship. In 1888 a women's tennis tournament was soon set up. In 1900, the Davis Cup was created and held in Massachusetts.\nGoverning Board.\nUnited States Tennis Association was national board for tennis in the United States. The organization original name was the National Lawn Tennis Association this was changed to its current name in 1975. They are responsible for the promotion and development of tennis athletes in the United States.\nTournaments.\nThere are 15 total active ATP, WTA, and Grand Slam tennis tournaments held in the United States. Twelve events are held on hard courts, two on clay, and one on grass. Six are ATP only, four are WTA only, and five tournaments are combined events. The US Open is one of four Grand Slam tennis tournaments. It is played in late August to early September at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, New York. The Indian Wells Masters, Miami Open and Cincinnati Masters are part of the ATP Tour Masters 1000 and the WTA 1000. In 2025, the Dallas &amp; Newport ATP 250 events will merge licenses with Dallas being upgraded to a 500 and Newport being phased out. \nPlayers.\nMen's.\nAmerican male tennis players used to be amongst the best in the world and produced many Grand slam winners for much of the 20th century. The number of male tennis inside ATP rankings has declined since the 21st century.\nWomen's.\nHelen Wills Moody won 31 Grand Slam titles in the 1920s and 1930s. She helped to popularize the overhand serve for women during the 1940s. Alice Marble is another important influential American tennis player. In 1939, she was a triple champion at Wimbledon. Her style of play was characterized as masculine because of her aggressive pursuit of the ball during serves and volleys. Like Helen Wills Moody, others would go on to copy her style of play. Maureen Connolly won the four Grand Slam singles tournaments in 1953.\nAlthea Gibson was the first African American woman to win a Grand Slam tournament. She claimed the singles title at the French Championships in 1956, and at Wimbledon and the US Nationals in 1957 and 1958.\nIn the Open Era, the United States has produced some of the most influential and successful players including Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova (defected from Czechoslovakia), Monica Seles (defected from Serbia and Montenegro), Venus Williams, and Serena Williams. The arrival of the Williams sisters is credited as the ushering in of a new era of power and athleticism on the women's tour and 23 time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams is considered by many to be the greatest women's player of all time."

        "text": "In the United States over 1,362,000 people frequently play badminton throughout the year, as of 2008.\nGameplay.\nIn badminton, the objective of the game is to hit the shuttlecock over the net and into your opponents boundary. If both of you are able to hit the shuttlecock or birdie back and forth a rally has ensued. A rally is won if one player hits the shuttlecock out of bounds or into the net. Games go to 21 points. The winner of three games wins the set.\nScoring.\nGames go to 21 points. If the score is 20-20, then it is win by two points. For example, 22–24. If the score manages to get to 29-29 then the next score wins.\nHistory.\nIn the United States the first badminton club was formed in New York in 1878. During the 1930s, badminton had become a popular sport in the United States. Establishments such as the YMCA, universities and more all formed badminton clubs and the popularity of the sport began to take growth. The sport was also aided by the support of celebrity participation. Celebrities such as Bette Davis, Douglas Fairbanks, Dick Powell, and others all participated in the sport, helping badminton gain popularity during the mid-half of the 20th century.\nStarting in 1936, the American Badminton Association was formed; however, in 1978 and 1996, the name would be changed to its current name of USA Badminton (or USAB). The main reason for the evolutionary changes is due to different groups and clubs from all around the United States uniting to standardize the rules of the game.\nThe time period between 1949 and 1967 was the biggest period of badminton popularity in the United States. In 1949, David Freeman brought the United States its first ever world championship title. Freeman won the Men's Singles at the All-England Championships. Additionally, between 1949 and 1967 the United States won 23 championships in badminton. The success led to Sports Illustrated featuring Joe Alston on the Cover of the March issue of 1955 to recognize the United States successes in badminton during that time period.\nIn 2016, USAB announced that they would be relocating their professional training facilities and headquarters from Colorado Spring to Anaheim, California.\nImportant figures.\nBen Lee.\nLee is the current USAB Board of Directors Chair.

The reason she started playing was because her immune system did not function properly, and Zhang's parents encouraged her to participate in a sport in order to strengthen it. Zhang started playing competitively in 2004.\nPopularity.\nBadminton is not a popular sport in the United States for several reasons. One of the main reasons is that badminton in the U.S. is seen as a backyard sport. Due to this, the sport has not grown much. Another reason is the lack of Olympic success by American athletes. This lack of success is another reason why the sport has not grown in comparison to other sports. Finally, wages are a huge reason why badminton has not gown. Badminton fails to receive substantial media attention in the United States and with that comes low wages. Participants can earn up to $15,000 for winning a championship, which is a relatively small amount of money in comparison to an average football player that has a salary of $2.7 million.\nUSAB National Elite Rankings.\nAs of December 6, 2019 the National Elite Rankings for team USA in Badminton were:\nNational team.\nThe United States men's and women's national teams have had limited success at the Summer Olympics."

The event began on Thursday 6 February at the P&amp;J Live in Aberdeen and ended with the Play-offs at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry on Thursday 15 October, after a delay was caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.\nMichael van Gerwen was the four-time defending champion after defeating Rob Cross 11–5 in the 2019 final. However, he was eliminated from the competition in week 16, after an 8–2 defeat to Daryl Gurney, and a poor run of form saw him slip out of the playoffs, for the first time in his career.\nGlen Durrant, who was making his debut in the tournament, finished the regular season in 1st place (becoming only the third player to do so, after van Gerwen and Phil Taylor, to set up a semi-final meeting between Gary Anderson. Durrant claimed a narrow 10–9 victory (including surviving 4 match darts from Anderson), before eventually winning the competition, by beating fellow debutant Nathan Aspinall 11–8 in the final to claim his first televised PDC title.\nThis was also the first time in Premier League Darts history that the four players that qualified for the finals had not appeared in the finals of the previous year's edition (the four players being van Gerwen, Gurney, Cross and James Wade).\nOn 12 March 2020, it was announced that the double-header due to be played in Rotterdam had been postponed due to coronavirus concerns. The following day it was announced that the Rotterdam dates would be moved to September, with the culmination of the tournament taking place there instead of London. On 16 March 2020. it was announced the round to be played in Newcastle would be moved to October, taking over as the tournament's final round.\nThe May dates were postponed on 9 April 2020, with the PDC announcing a fully rescheduled calendar, the play-offs now taking place in Sheffield. Further changes were announced in July and August, with the cancellation of the events in Birmingham, Belfast, Leeds, Berlin, Glasgow, Manchester, Newcastle, Sheffield, and the double header in Rotterdam; and the reinstatement of The O2 Arena as the host of the final. Ten nights were added to the calendar to be held behind closed doors at the Marshall Arena in Milton Keynes. The play-offs were subsequently moved to the Ricoh Arena in Coventry and also played behind closed doors.\nFormat.\nThe tournament format will remain the same as 2019, with the only difference being the re-branding of 'contenders' to 'challengers' for this season.\nPhase 1:\nIn each round, eight of the nine players play each other in four matches and the ninth player plays one match against one of the nine challengers. Phase 1 matches have a maximum of twelve legs, allowing for the winner being first to seven or a six-six draw. At the end of Phase 1, the bottom player is eliminated from the competition.\nPhase 2:\nIn each round, the remaining eight players play each other in four matches. Phase 2 matches have a maximum of fourteen legs, allowing for the winner being first to eight or a seven-seven draw.

This was the 20th season of Division III college ice hockey.\nThe NCAA restarted the Division II Championship for this season and all programs from Division II schools were required to submit bids to the second-tier championship despite continuing to play in a majority Division III conference. Due to the low number and sometimes vast distance between the schools, no Division II conferences were formed, even from the few programs that became independent. The records for all Division II schools that remained in their previous conferences are listed here.\nDue in part to this new arrangement, ECAC West split and the State University of New York Athletic Conference began officially sponsoring ice hockey. While both conferences, along with ECAC East fell under the ECAC umbrella, ECAC East stopped counting inter-conference games in their standings while ECAC West continued to count games against SUNYAC teams for this season before dropping the practice entirely. The SUNYAC had already been holding a conference schedule to determine which teams participated in the SUNYAC tournament and the conference simply stopped counting non-SUNYAC games for their standings.\nThe NCAA began naming a national Division III player of the year, a counterpart to the Hobey Baker Award."

At the time no conferences moved to D-II and while several teams left their conferences to become Division II Independents, many more nominally D-II programs remained in their D-III conferences but would submit bids to the Division II Championship. Due to the low number of programs qualifying as Division II, the entire tournament was held between two teams as a best-of-three series."

        "text": "The Scotland women's national football team has represented Scotland at the FIFA Women's World Cup on one occasion, in 2019.\n2019 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nScotland, 20th in the March 2019 FIFA World Rankings, qualified for their first World Cup after finishing top of UEFA Group 2 ahead of Switzerland and Poland. At the draw for the finals held in France, they were placed in Group D alongside rivals England (ranked 3rd in the world, who had beaten an under-strength Scottish team 6–0 at the 2017 European Championship), Japan (ranked 7th, who won the tournament in 2011 and reached the final in 2015), and Argentina (ranked 37th, who had lost all six of their previous World Cup finals matches).\nAll three group matches saw the use of the newly introduced Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system feature prominently. In the opening match against England in Nice, a penalty kick was awarded against Scotland for accidental handball after a VAR review. This was converted, and England dominated play and scored again before half time. Scotland improved in the second half and scored a goal late on through Claire Emslie, but could not find an equaliser.\nThe second match against Japan in Rennes followed a similar pattern; this time the opponents took the lead in open play, then scored a penalty awarded via VAR for a foul to deservedly lead by two at the interval. Scotland created more in the second half and appeared to have two reasonable penalty claims in incidents involving Erin Cuthbert (a foul and handball), but no VAR reviews were carried out. Substitute Lana Clelland scored a fine goal with two minutes remaining, but a 2–1 defeat was again the final outcome.\nFour third-place teams would qualify for the knockout rounds, and other results meant that either Scotland or Argentina would be likely to progress if they won their meeting in Paris. The Scots took the lead through Kim Little, and were 3–0 up with 21 minutes remaining after further goals from Jen Beattie and Cuthbert. Argentina quickly pulled two goals back, the second rebounding in off goalkeeper Lee Alexander after hitting the crossbar. With four minutes to go, Argentina were awarded a penalty for a foul challenge after a lengthy VAR review. Alexander saved the shot, but it was ordered to be re-taken when VAR indicated she had moved slightly off her line before it was struck; Argentina scored with the second attempt, with the goal timed at 94 minutes. Despite the delays, little further stoppage time was played and the match ended with the final score 3–3, eliminating both teams, with the fact Scotland had gained their first World Cup point providing no consolation in the dramatic circumstances."

Additionally, with an NCAA-sponsored tournament for Division III schools, most NAIA teams switched to NCAA classification and, with the NAIA Ice Hockey Championship becoming a superfluous tournament, the NAIA ended its sponsorship of ice hockey in 1984.\nBecause only one Division III tournament existed at the time and it permitted its Division II members to participate in the conference tournament no automatic bids could be offered to conference tournament champions. The NCAA continued to refrain from offering automatic bids until 2000."

The competition was introduced in 2018 and is organised by the Latvian Basketball Association and the Estonian Basketball Association.\nHistory.\nFollowing the demise of the Baltic Basketball League, the LEBL was established in 2018 when the Latvijas Basketbola līga (LBL) and the Korvpalli Meistriliiga (KML) largely merged. In its inaugural season, 15 teams participated in the league. After a Final Four is played to determine the winner of the league, there are playoffs to decide the national champions of Latvia and Estonia. The first game was played on 28 September 2018, with Estonian champions BC Kalev/Cramo hosting a game against the Latvian champions BK Ventspils. On 9 April 2019, BK Ventspils won the first league championship. On 19 November 2021, representatives of the Latvian Basketball Association and the Estonian Basketball Association agreed to continue the development of a joint league for the next three years. Both parties acknowledged that the league promotes the development of players and coaches, attracts basketball fans and inspires young people to focus on basketball.\nIn June 2022, Ukrainian club BC Prometey joined the league as the Ukrainian SuperLeague was suspended due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The team plays its home games in Riga.\nTitle sponsorships.\nSince inaugural season, the League has had title sponsorship rights sold to two companies, most recently to the Paf betting company. \nCompetition format.\nThe competition follows a double round-robin format. During the course of a season each club plays each other club twice (once at home and once away). Teams' rankings at season end are determined by winning percentage. At season end, the eight top teams play-off, pitting the first place standings team against the 8th place team, and so on. The play-off format initially was supposed to be Quarterfinals and Final Four, but since the inaugural season it has changed every season. \nFor the 2023-24 season play-off format changed. Quarterfinals and semifinals are to be played in best-of-three series, while bronze and gold medals are to be played out in one game with hosts being a team that finished regular season higher in the standings. \nHome Grown Player Rule.\nA foreign player (not Latvian or Estonian) who has been registered and played in the Latvian National Championship or the Estonian National Championship for three consecutive seasons between the ages of 12 and 19 is considered to be a local player.\nAll-Final Four Team.\nThe Latvian-Estonian Basketball League All-Final Four Team is an award for the Latvian-Estonian Basketball League, that is given to the league's top five basketball players for each season.\nLeague records.\nThe following records include games played in the Latvian-Estonian Basketball League since its establishement in 2018. These records do not include any games played in local championship playoffs, Latvian Basketball League and Estonian Basketball League respectively. "

        "text": "The 1975–76 Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey team represented the University of Minnesota in college ice hockey. In its 4th year under head coach Herb Brooks the team compiled a 28–14–2 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the third consecutive year and seventh all-time. The Golden Gophers defeated Michigan Tech 6–4 in the championship game at the DU Arena in Denver, Colorado to win their second national championship.\nSeason.\nFast start.\nAfter a disappointing end to what was otherwise a tremendous season, Minnesota entered the 1975–76 campaign with a fairly young team. Herb Brooks' squad had only two seniors and four juniors leaving the team rather shorthanded in terms of experience. The Gophers' didn't let their youth stand in the way of a fast start, however. Minnesota won their first game in October over the US National Team which kicked off a 5-game winning streak. The Gophers suffered their first loss in their first true road game of the season when they were beaten by Denver in overtime. While Minnesota recovered to earn a split for the weekend, that series was the start of a 10-game trend where they alternated wins and losses. At the end of December Minnesota finally stopped losing every weekend and put together another 5-game winning streak to push their record to 14–5.\nNew Year and .500 hockey.\nThe Gophers began 1976 with a series against the defending national champions, Michigan Tech and while they split the series, the two teams combined for 25 goals in the two games. Minnesota then took seven out of eight points against Notre Dame and Denver before visiting Michigan and dropping both contest to the surprisingly strong Wolverines. After two more wins at Minnesota–Duluth the Gophers lost two more Big Ten contests, this time to Michigan State. Two losses dropped Minnesota's Big Ten record to 2–6 though they were still well positioned with a 19–10–1 mark in the WCHA. The following weekend the Gophers split with Wisconsin to guarantee that they would finish with a losing record in the Big Ten and continued to split each weekend for the remaining 4 weeks of the regular season.\nWCHA tournament.\nDespite their mediocre finish, Minnesota managed to hold onto home ice for the first round of the WCHA tournament and played host to Colorado College. The Gopher defense stepped up in the first game and gave Minnesota a 4-goal margin of victory that allowed the team to cruise to a 10–5 series win after taking the second contest. Minnesota was forced to hit the road for the second round, heading to Michigan State and facing off against the nation's leading scorer in Tom Ross. Minnesota was able to hold the Spartan offence to only two goals in the first game but could only manage two itself and the match ended in a 2-2 tie. both offenses woke up for the deciding second game and managed to score six times in regulation. Overtime was played at the same high pace but the goaltenders turned aside everything that came their way for over 40 minutes before Minnesota broke the tie and captured their third straight WCHA championship. Jeff Tscherne recorded 72 saves in the win, a Minnesota team record as of 2018.\nNCAA tournament.\nAs they had two years earlier, Minnesota opened as the underdog against ECAC champion Boston University and just like 1974 the Gophers were able to send the Terriers packing. In the championship game Minnesota met Michigan Tech for the third consecutive year, the only time in NCAA where the same two team made the final three years running (as of 2019). The defending champion Huskies had produced a stellar season thus far and had already set a new NCAA record with 34 wins on the season. The top offense in the nation was led by future NHL-er Mike Zuke who had posted 103 points on the season and was only two behind Tom Ross for the scoring title. It didn't take much time from the start of the contest to figure out that it was not Jeff Tscherne's night. Michigan Tech scored three times in under four minutes to build a huge lead less than twelve minutes into the contest. Tscherne remained in net for the rest of the period and was able to stem the tide but it was a power play goal from Tom Vannelli at the end of the first that gave Minnesota some breathing room. Tscherne was replaced by Tom Mohr from the second on and the junior netminder was given time to settle in when Minnesota opened an offensive salvo on the Michigan Tech net. The Gophers outshot the Huskies 16–3 in the second and scored three times to erase the Tech advantage and take the lead themselves. Michigan Tech halted the Gopher charge with their fourth goal that came with 36 seconds to play to send the teams into the final frame in a tied game. The play was much more even in the third but Minnesota managed to score first with team captain Pat Phippen's goal near the middle of the stanza. Mohr held the Huskies off the scoresheet and allowed Warren Miller to cap the scoring with 30 seconds left.\nMinnesota's second championship in three years was even more improbable that their first and the 1976 Golden Gophers became the first team since the 1948–49 Boston College Eagles to have a national champion composed entirely of American players. Furthermore, with Jim Boo having been raised in Minnesota they were the second team to have all of their players hail from one state.\nTom Vannelli's 5 points in the title tile earned him the Tournament MOP, however, for the only time in its history the NCAA did not name an All-Tournament Team. No Minnesota players were named to the AHCA All-American West Team and only Reed Larson made an appearance on an All-WCHA Team, earning first-team honors.\nThree Minnesota players were taken at the 1976 NHL Amateur Draft. Reed Larson went on to have a very successful NHL career, becoming a three-time NHL All-Star.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | "

        "text": "The Bangladesh women's cricket team played the Pakistan women's cricket team in October and November 2019. The tour consisted of two Women's One Day Internationals (WODIs) and three Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) matches, and all were played at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. It was the first time that the Pakistan women's team played at the stadium. The Bangladesh women's team last toured Pakistan in September and October 2015.\nThe Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) opted not to send any of their Indian support staff, to avoid visa issues and political tensions between India and Pakistan. Less than two weeks from the start of the tour, the series was thrown into doubt, after the Bangladesh government had not yet given clearance for the team to travel. However, on 21 October 2019, the BCB confirmed the squads for the tour. The following day, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed the itinerary for the tour.\nPakistan won all three WT20I matches. In the WODI series, Pakistan won the first match by 29 runs, and Bangladesh won the second by one wicket.\nSquads.\nLabone Akther, Nahida Akter, Happy Alam, Sabinkun Nahar Jesmin, Fahima Khatun, Ritu Moni, Sobhana Mostary and Zinnat Asia Orthi were also named as standby players for Bangladesh."

        "text": "The men's single sculls event at the 2020 Summer Olympics took place from 23 to 30 July 2021 at the Sea Forest Waterway. 32 rowers from 32 nations competed.\nBackground.\nThis will be the 28th appearance of the event, which was not held at the first Games in 1896 (when bad weather forced the cancellation of all rowing events) but has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1900.\nOf the 6 finalists from the 2016 Games, silver medalist Damir Martin of Croatia is the only one to return. Two-time reigning gold medalist Mahé Drysdale was defeated by Jordan Parry in New Zealand's selection process.\nThe three World Champions since the 2016 Games are Ondřej Synek of the Czech Republic (a three-time Olympic medalist), Kjetil Borch of Norway, and Oliver Zeidler of Germany. Synek announced on his Facebook page that he will not be going to Tokyo. Borch and Zeidler competed in Tokyo.\nBenin, the Dominican Republic, the Ivory Coast, Nicaragua, and Saudi Arabia made their debut in the event. An athlete from Russia competed under the ROC flag. Italy and the Netherlands each made their 15th appearance, tied for most among nations competing in Tokyo and fourth-most among all nations (Great Britain at 22, the United States at 21, and Switzerland at 16 did not have competitors in this event at the 2020 Games).\nQualification.\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) has been limited to a single boat (one rower) in the event since 1912. There are 32 qualifying places in the men's single sculls:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic delayed many of the events for qualifying for rowing.\nCompetition format.\nThis rowing event is a single scull event, meaning that each boat is propelled by a single rower. The \"scull\" portion means that the rower uses two oars, one on each side of the boat; this contrasts with sweep rowing in which each rower has one oar and rows on only one side (not feasible for singles events). The competition consists of multiple rounds. The competition continues to use the five-round format introduced in 2012. Finals are held to determine the placing of each boat; these finals are given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better ranking. Semifinals are named based on which finals they fed, with each semifinal having two possible finals. The course uses the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912.\nDuring the first round six heats are held. The first three boats in each heat advance to the quarterfinals, while all others are relegated to the repechages.\nThe repechage is a round which offers rowers a second chance to qualify for the quarterfinals. Placing in the repechage heats determines which quarterfinal the boat would race in. The top two boats in each repechage heat move on to the quarterfinals, with the remaining boats going to the E/F semifinals.\nThe four quarterfinals are the second round for rowers still competing for medals. Placing in the quarterfinal heats determines which semifinal the boat would race in. The top three boats in each quarterfinal move on to the A/B semifinals, with the bottom three boats going to the C/D semifinals.\nSix semifinals are held, two each of A/B semifinals, C/D semifinals, and E/F semifinals. For each semifinal race, the top three boats move on to the better of the two finals, while the bottom three boats go to the lesser of the two finals possible. For example, a second-place finish in an A/B semifinal would result in advancement to the A final.\nThe fifth and final round is the finals. Each final determines a set of rankings. The A final determines the medals, along with the rest of the places through 6th. The B final gives rankings from 7th to 12th, the C from 13th to 18th, and so on. Thus, to win a medal rowers have to finish in the top three of their heat (or top two of their repechage heat), top three of their quarterfinal, and top three of their A/B semifinal to reach the A final.\nSchedule.\nThe competition is held over eight days. Times given are session start times; multiple rowing events might have races during a session.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first three of each heat qualify for the quarterfinals, while the remainder go to the repechage.\nRepechage.\nThe first two in each heat qualify for the quarterfinals; the rest go to Semifinals E/F (out of medal contention).\nQuarterfinals.\nThe first three of each heat qualify to the semifinals A/B, remaining Crews to Semifinal C/D\nSemifinals.\nThe first three of each heat qualify to the better final (E, C, A) while the remainder go to the lower final (F, D, B). The exception is that for Semifinal E/F 1 the first two qualify to Final E instead of the first three."

For 2020, the 7-boat field was deliberate. There were two heats, with the winner of each advancing directly to the final and the remaining five boats competing in the repechage. The top four in the repechage also advanced to the final; only the last-place boat was eliminated (with an overall rank of 7th place). The final determined the medals as well as 4th to 6th places.\nSchedule.\nThe competition was held over six days. Times given are session start times; multiple rowing events might have races during a session.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe winners of each heat qualified for the final, while the remainder went to the repechage.\nRepechage.\nThe first four advanced to Final A."

        "text": "The women's single sculls event at the 2020 Summer Olympics took place from 23 to 30 July 2021 at the Sea Forest Waterway. 32 rowers from 32 nations competed.\nBackground.\nThis was the 12th appearance of the event, which has been held every year since women's rowing was introduced in 1976.\nThe World Champions since the 2016 Games are Jeannine Gmelin of Switzerland, (2017) and Sanita Pušpure, (2018 and 2019) of Ireland. Both rowers qualified for the 2020 regatta.\nQualification.\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) is limited to a single boat (one rower) in the event. There are 32 qualifying places in the women's single sculls:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic delayed many of the events for qualifying for rowing.\nCompetition format.\nThis rowing event is a single scull event, meaning that each boat is propelled by a single rower. The \"scull\" portion means that the rower uses two oars, one on each side of the boat; this contrasts with sweep rowing in which each rower has one oar and rows on only one side (not feasible for singles events). The competition consists of multiple rounds. The competition continues to use the five-round format introduced in 2012. Finals are held to determine the placing of each boat; these finals are given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better ranking. Semifinals are named based on which finals they feed, with each semifinal having two possible finals. The course uses the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912.\nDuring the first round six heats are held. The first three boats in each heat advance to the quarterfinals, while all others are relegated to the repechages.\nThe repechage is a round which offers rowers a second chance to qualify for the quarterfinals. Placing in the repechage heats determines which quarterfinal the boat would race in. The top two boats in each repechage heat move on to the quarterfinals, with the remaining boats going to the E/F semifinals.\nThe four quarterfinals are the second round for rowers still competing for medals. Placing in the quarterfinal heats determines which semifinal the boat would race in. The top three boats in each quarterfinal move on to the A/B semifinals, with the bottom three boats going to the C/D semifinals.\nSix semifinals are held, two each of A/B semifinals, C/D semifinals, and E/F semifinals. For each semifinal race, the top three boats move on to the better of the two finals, while the bottom three boats go to the lesser of the two finals possible. For example, a second-place finish in an A/B semifinal would result in advancement to the A final.\nThe fifth and final round is the finals. Each final determines a set of rankings. The A final determines the medals, along with the rest of the places through 6th. The B final gives rankings from 7th to 12th, the C from 13th to 18th, and so on. Thus, to win a medal rowers have to finish in the top three of their heat (or top two of their repechage heat), top three of their quarterfinal, and top three of their A/B semifinal to reach the A final.\nSchedule.\nThe competition is held over eight days. Times given are session start times; multiple rowing events might have races during a session.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first three of each heat qualify for the quarterfinals, while the remainder go to the repechage.\nRepechage.\nThe first two in each heat qualify for the quarterfinals; the rest go to Semifinals E/F (out of medal contention).\nQuarterfinals.\nThe first three of each heat qualify to Semifinal A/B, while the remainder go to Semifinal C/D (out of medal contention).\nSemifinals.\nThe first three of each heat qualify to the better final (E, C, A) while the remainder go to the lower final (F, D, B)."

        "title": "Siasconset Golf Club",
        "text": "Siasconset Golf Club, also known as the Siasconset Golf Course and commonly shortened to the Sconset Golf Course, is one of the easternmost golf courses in Massachusetts, perched on the edge of Nantucket Island in Siasconset, Massachusetts. This is the oldest golf course still active on Nantucket and one of the oldest golf courses in America. It once was considered the oldest privately owned golf course in the country still open to the public but, as of May 1, 2012, it is no longer privately owned. It is still known by island locals as \"Skinner's Golf Club\", or \"Skinner's\", because Robert \"Skinner\" Coffin was a co-owner and the superintendent of the course for many years and use to host a recreational golf tournament, known as \"The Skinner Open\", which was held during the years 1977 to 2011. It is currently operating as a public 9-hole course. This course was also listed in \"Links Magazine\"s article titled \"The Top 10 Old Courses You Can Play\". On October 24, 2019, this course was named the New England Golf Course Owners Association's \"Golf Course of New England\" for 2020.\nHistory.\nTourism was responsible for the creation of the island's golf courses as Nantucket catered more to this industry at the end of the 19th century. In 1894, John Grout leased property near Siasconset from owner Levi Starbuck Coffin to develop this course on the land which was the old Bloomingdale Farm. The current course's clubhouse is the old farmhouse. This course was designed by John Grout and Alex Findlay.\nIn 1917, Mike Brady set the United States record for scoring two holes in one in an 18-hole match which was a record held until 1949.\nThis course thrived until 1922 which was when the Sankaty Head Golf Club was established and became their competition. After this many golfers started playing at Sankaty Head Golf Club instead. Due to this competition, this course was abandoned by the Coffin family for many years until. In 1930, Henry Coffin Jr., at age 16, took over running it. The course had numerous changes over its history. The original square greens were changed to the well-known round greens. Even the amount of holes changed from 9-holes to 18-holes and then back to 9-holes before World War II. Henry Coffin Jr. was the golf superintendent of this course until he died in June 1994.\nIn 1994, after Henry Coffin Jr.'s death, Robert Coffin became the course's new superintendent. Robert Coffin was already working with his father on the course before his death. The then Coffin estate, comprising 460 acres, was passed down to his four children: Robert (\"Skinner\"), Henry (\"Hank\") III, Stephanie, and Mitchell Coffin.\nIn 1995, the four children were forced to sell off 250 acres to pay inheritance taxes to keep the golf course property. The Nantucket Golf Club, Inc. purchased the 250 acres for $8.25 million and, in 1998, their new 18-hole private course opened. The land they purchased included the second and third holes of the original Siaconset Golf Course, so these holes needed to be redesigned. Now the second hole is a 480-yard stretch with a dog-leg right hook and the third hole is a par 3 tight 217 yard stretch with a sloping fairway.\nAlso in 1995, the Nantucket Golf Club, Inc. leased the Siasconset Golf Course from the Coffin family for a 10-year period. Robert Coffin was the superintendent of the course throughout the lease and maintained the course independently. The Coffin family chose not to renew the lease when the course fell into disrepair toward the end of the lease period.\nIn 2005, Robert Coffin retired as the course's superintendent and was succeeded by his brother and fellow co-owner Henry Coffin III who came out of retirement to be the course's next superintendent. Henry Coffin III previously had worked at Sankaty Head Golf Club as their course superintendent for 22 years. Robert Coffin remained the bookkeeper of the club.\nIn 2012, Henry Coffin III retired as the course's superintendent as it was then acquired on May 1, 2012 by a joint effort of The Nantucket Island Land Bank and The 'Sconset Trust. This was when this course ceased to be privately owned.\nShortly thereafter, on July 19, 2012, which is 118 years after the course's creation, the course had its first website www.siasconsetgolf.com, which last existed on November 10, 2015. Currently this course is managed by Nantucket Golf Management (NGM) Inc, which is the same management team running the Miacomet Golf Course; one of the other golf courses on Nantucket. The current general manager is Alan Costa. The current superintendent is Sean Oberly.\nOn October 24, 2019, the Siasconset Golf Course was named the New England Golf Course Owners Association's \"Golf Course of New England\" for 2020. The course was also chosen as one of four nominees for the National Golf Course Owners Association's 2020 Best Course in the U.S.\nOn May 28, 2021, which is 127 years after this course's creation, the course will be finally requiring tee times in order to play golf. The lack of a tee time requirement was unique to this course throughout its history."

Wellens attacked the lead group at from the finish, on the approach to the \"Côte de Nanteuil-la-Fôret\". The remainder of the breakaway were caught with remaining, while Wellens had an advantage of over a minute and a half to the peloton. Julian Alaphilippe attacked on the final climb of the day, the \"Côte de Mutigny\", reaching Wellens at the top of the climb. Alaphilippe then continued forward, alone, for the final .\nStage 4.\n9 July 2019 - Reims to Nancy, \nA group of three riders went ahead of the peloton from early in the stage, having an advantage of around three and a half minutes with remaining.

Continuing south, the riders climbed the category 2 Col des Chevrères, before winding south and then east, to the finish line at the category 1 climb to La Planche des Belles Filles, at . This was the fourth ever finish at La Planche des Belles Filles, with the three previous times always resulting in the eventual overall Tour winner ending this stage in the yellow jersey.\nNew Zealand's Patrick Bevin did not start the stage, becoming the first rider to withdraw from the tour after X-rays revealed fractured ribs as a result of crash two days before. Later during the stage Nicolas Edet would abandon as well, due to illness.\nAt the start of the stage, fourteen riders quickly formed the breakaway group, including amongst others the leader of the mountains classification Tim Wellens; former stage winners Thomas De Gendt and André Greipel; and the 2019 Giro d'Italia mountains classification winner Giulio Ciccone who was also the best placed in the general classification at 1' 43\" behind Julian Alaphilippe. The advantage over the peloton quickly rose to five minutes, growing to eight minutes at the foot of the Ballon d'Alsace, with struggling to bring the peloton closer and stopping the chase altogether. Meanwhile at the front, Wellens was gathering most points for the mountains classification, occasionally helped by his teammate De Gendt. De Gendt sprinted away to take the points on the Col des Croix and took a lead of 30 seconds in the descent, but was overtaken on the next climb when the breakaway group got split up completely. Four riders remained in the lead and started the ascent of the final climb with still four minutes of advantage over the peloton: Giulio Ciccone and three Flemish riders: Wellens, Xandro Meurisse and Dylan Teuns. Ciccone and Teuns still had two minutes of advantage over the peloton with one kilometre to go, in spite of attacks from Warren Barguil and Mikel Landa in front of a chasing peloton. Teuns drove the full last km just in front of Ciccone, dropping him only in the last 100 metres to take his first Grand Tour stage win, while Meurisse managed to take third place over a minute behind. Geraint Thomas was fastest of the favorites, gaining some seconds over most other favorites and Alaphilippe. Bigger time losses were noted for Steven Kruijswijk and Enric Mas who lost over half a minute, while Vincenzo Nibali and Romain Bardet lost almost a full minute. Despite finishing second, Ciccone did manage to take over the yellow jersey from Alaphilippe by a narrow margin of only six seconds.\nStage 7.\n12 July 2019 - Belfort to Chalon-sur-Saône, \nStage seven was the longest stage of the tour. A two-man breakaway, comprising Stéphane Rossetto and Yoann Offredo, led from early in the stage. Tejay van Garderen and Mike Teunissen crashed after of racing, but both managed to continue. The two man-breakaway extended their lead to over four minutes, but returned to the peloton with remaining. The stage then concluded with a bunch sprint.\nStage 8.\n13 July 2019 - Mâcon to Saint-Étienne, \nA quartet of riders established a five minute lead, by the intermediate sprint, at into the stage. The group contained Thomas De Gendt, Niki Terpstra, Ben King and Alessandro De Marchi. Terpstra won the intermediate sprint, and De Gendt then led the race over the first three climbs. De Gendt and De Marchi dropped the other two riders on the \"Côte de la Croix de Part\", with still to race. Michael Woods, Geraint Thomas and Gianni Moscon were involved in a crash with remaining, which destroyed Moscon's bike frame, though all riders were able to continue. De Gendt attacked De Marchi with to race, having around a minute's advantage over the main group of riders. As De Marchi was caught by the main group, Julian Alaphilippe attacked and Thibaut Pinot quickly followed. The pair kept their gap over the peloton, to the finish, but failed to catch stage winner De Gendt.\nStage 9.\n14 July 2019 - Saint-Étienne to Brioude, \nEarly in the stage, Alessandro De Marchi suffered a crash which required hospitalisation. A 15-strong breakaway group went ahead of the peloton before the category 1 \"Mur d'Aurec-sur-Loire\" and gained a 10-minute advantage before the intermediate sprint, which was won by Edvald Boasson Hagen. Simon Clarke and Jan Tratnik attacked the lead group with remaining, with some of the group chasing them down. Lukas Pöstlberger then managed to gain just under a minute's advantage, with still to race, but was caught and left behind on the \"Cote de Saint-Just\" by Nicolas Roche and Tiesj Benoot, later. Daryl Impey then bridged the gap to the two lead riders. With to go, Benoot attacked, dropping Roche, while Impey stayed with the leader. The two attackers maintained their advantage to the finish, with the fragmented breakaway group crossing the line in the following minutes, and the peloton finishing 16 minutes later.\nStage 10.\n15 July 2019 - Saint-Flour to Albi, \nA five-man breakaway group went ahead from early in the stage, gaining a lead of about three and a half minutes. The intermediate sprint was won by Odd Christian Eiking from the group, with the peloton closing the lead group's advantage down to a minute and a half. With still to race, crosswinds began to temporarily fracture the peloton. Crosswinds happened again with to go, but pressure from the lead section of the broken peloton ensured that a gap was maintained. The lead section of the peloton then caught the breakaway group with to race, while the second and a third section were at 30 seconds and a minute's disadvantage, respectively. By the last , the gaps were stretched out further. Wout van Aert then won the sprint, from the lead section of the peloton.\nRest day 1.\n16 July 2019 - Albi\nStage 11.\n17 July 2019 - Albi to Toulouse, \nA four-man breakaway established itself early in the stage, comprising Lilian Calmejane, Stéphane Rossetto, Anthony Perez and Aimé De Gendt. The group achieved an advantage of three and a half minutes by the \"Côte de Tonnac\", into the stage. Perez won the intermediate sprint in Gaillac, with still to race. With to race, the breakaway group's advantage had been reduced to less than a minute. A crash in the peloton happened around from the finish line, forcing Niki Terpstra to abandon the Tour, and requiring Nairo Quintana and Richie Porte's teammates to help their team leaders back to the peloton. De Gendt attacked from the breakaway group with remaining, achieving a 40-second gap, but De Gendt and the rest of the lead group were caught with less than from the finish. The race then finished with a bunch sprint. During the sprint, a spectator's cell phone hit the helmet of Niccolò Bonifazio, ruining his chances at a stage victory and making the Italian sprinter visibly frustrated."

        "text": "Kingsmead Cricket Ground in Durban, South Africa was established in 1922 and hosted its first international cricket match in January 1923. The ground's first Test saw South Africa played the touring England cricket team. It hosted its first One Day International (ODI) in 1992 following the readmission of South Africa to international cricket after the sporting boycott of South Africa during the apartheid era, and its first Twenty20 International (T20I) in 2007. Two women's Test matches have been played on the ground, the first in 1960, and a single women's T20I was played in 2016.\nIn cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five-for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement. This article details the five-wicket hauls taken on the ground in official international Test matches, One Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals.\nThe first international five-wicket hauls taken on the ground was by Englishman Alec Kennedy who took five wickets for the cost of 88 runs (5/88) in the ground's first Test match in 1923. The 8/69 taken by South African Hugh Tayfield against England in 1957 set a new best bowling analysis by a South African in Test matches and remain the best innings bowling figures in Test matches on the ground. The first five-wicket haul in women's Tests on the ground was taken by South Africa's Jean McNaughton in the first women's Test played on the ground in 1960.\nThe first five-wicket haul in an ODI on the ground was taken by Pakistan's Waqar Younis in 1993, whilst India's Ashish Nehra recorded the best bowling ODI figures of 6/23 during a 2003 Cricket World Cup match against England. Only one five-wicket haul has been taken in a T20I on the ground, David Wiese of South Africa taking 5/23 in 2015.\nTest match five-wicket hauls.\nA total of 60 five-wicket hauls have been taken on the ground in Test matches, including three taken in women's Tests.\nOne Day International five-wicket hauls.\nFour five-wicket hauls have been taken in men's ODI matches on the ground.\nTwenty20 International five-wicket hauls.\nTwo five-wicket hauls have been taken in T20I matches on the ground - one in men's matches and one in women's matches."

        "text": "The 2019–20 NCAA Division I women's basketball season began in November 2019 and concluded prematurely on March 12, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament was scheduled to end at Smoothie King Center in New Orleans, Louisiana on April 5, 2020, but was ultimately canceled. All other postseason tournaments were canceled as well. It was the first cancellation in the history of the NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament. Practices officially began in late September 2019.\nOn December 31, 2020, South Carolina raised a banner recognizing a claim to a national championship for finishing first in the two major polls.\nSeason headlines.\nMilestones and records.\nThe following players reached the 2,000-point milestone during the season—Sabrina Ionescu and Ruthy Hebard, both of Oregon.\nIonescu and Hebard both reached the 1,000-rebound milestone during the season. Hebard reached this milestone in the same game in which Ionescu surpassed the 2,000-point mark. Ionescu reached the mark in Oregon's 74–66 win over Stanford on February 24, 2020, reaching two additional milestones during this game. She recorded her eighth triple-double of the season, tying her own record from last season for the most in a single season in NCAA history for either men or women. Ionescu also became the first player in NCAA basketball history with 2,000 points, 1,000 assists, and 1,000 rebounds in a career. She had previously joined Courtney Vandersloot of Gonzaga (2007–11) as the only Division I players with 2,000 points and 1,000 assists.\nOn December 18, Baylor guard Juicy Landrum set a new Division I women's record with 14 three-pointers in the Lady Bears' 111–43 rout of Arkansas State. This was more three-pointers than the Lady Bears had previously recorded as a team in a single game.\nFour days later, Brittany Brewer of Texas Tech tied the Division I record for blocks in a game, recording 16 as part of a triple-double in the Lady Raiders' 83–38 rout of Louisiana–Monroe. Coincidentally, the previous record-holder, former TCU player Sandora Irvin, also reached that mark as part of a triple-double.\nConference membership changes.\nTwo schools joined new conferences for the 2019–20 season. Both moved between Division I and Division II, with one joining Division I and the other leaving Division I.\nIn addition, two existing Division I teams assumed new athletic identities.\nAfter the 2018–19 school year, Long Island University (LIU) merged the athletic programs of its two main campuses—the Division I LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds and Division II LIU Post Pioneers—into a single program that now plays as the LIU Sharks. The Sharks inherited the Division I and Northeast Conference memberships of the Brooklyn campus, with some sports to be based in Brooklyn and others at the Post campus in Brookville, New York. Specific to basketball, LIU announced that the unified men's and women's teams in that sport would be based in Brooklyn.\nOn July 1, 2019, the University of Missouri–Kansas City (UMKC) announced that its athletic program, formerly known as the UMKC Kangaroos, would officially become the Kansas City Roos, with \"Roos\" having long been used as a short form of the former \"Kangaroos\" nickname.\nSeason outlook.\nPre-season polls.\nThe top 25 from the AP and USA Today Coaches Polls.\nRegular season.\nUpsets.\nAn upset is a victory by an underdog team. In the context of NCAA Division I Women's Basketball, this generally constitutes an unranked team defeating a team currently ranked in the Top 25. This list will highlight those upsets of ranked teams by unranked teams as well as upsets of #1 teams. Rankings are from the AP poll.\nBold type indicates winning teams in \"true road games\"—i.e., those played on an opponent's home court (including secondary homes).\nConference winners and tournaments.\nEach of the 32 Division I athletic conferences ends its regular season with a single-elimination tournament. The team with the best regular-season record in each conference is given the number one seed in each tournament, with tiebreakers used as needed in the case of ties for the top seeding. The winners of these tournaments receive automatic invitations to the 2020 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament.\nAward winners.\nAll-America teams.\nThe NCAA has never recognized a consensus All-America team in women's basketball. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by the Associated Press (AP), the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), the \"Sporting News\", and the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.\nBefore the 2017–18 season, it was impossible for a consensus women's All-America team to be determined because the AP had been the only body that divided its women's selections into separate teams. The USBWA first named separate teams in 2017–18. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA), continues the USBWA's former practice of selecting a single 10-member (plus ties) team. The NCAA does not recognize \"Sporting News\" as an All-America selector in women's basketball.\nCoaching changes.\nSeveral teams changed coaches during and after the season."

In 1934 and 1935 he played in Wollongong, New South Wales when he was sent there in his work with the N.S.W. Police Department.\nMartin played three first grade games with the Saints in 1933, often with his brother Bernie in the same team. He was killed in a motor vehicle accident whilst visiting his family at the Arncliffe, New South Wales home on 1 April 1937. His motorbike was in a collision with a cart and his body was pierced by a shaft connected to the cart, causing him to bleed to death before he could get hospital assistance."

The USIBA was also the first organization to hold national collegiate-level women's boxing championships in the United States (the subject of which had been another point of contention with the NCBA), beginning with their inaugural national tournament in 2013.\nThe association is an affiliate of USA Boxing.\nParticipating schools.\nCurrent schools:\nFormer schools:\nWeight Classes.\nThe USIBA closely follows the weight classes prescribed by USA Boxing, though does not name the classes, instead referring to them only by the weight itself. Not all weight classes are necessarily contested at each national tournament.\nNational Tournament.\nIn the national tournament, boxers are divided into three classes: Beginner (0-2 sanctioned bouts), Novice (0-9 bouts), and Elite (5+ bouts), as per USA Boxing rules. The experience division plays into the final team scoring system, in which more experienced boxers earn more points for their team. This structure also allows for the possibility of, for example, a boxer winning a Beginner championship and then competing for a Novice title later in the tournament, usually on the final day.\nTeam scoring.\nQuarterfinal wins: \nSemifinal wins:\nChampionship wins:\nNational Team Champions.\nChampions are as follows:"

        "text": "Adam O'Brien (born 26 October 1977) is an Australian professional rugby league football coach who is the head coach of the Newcastle Knights in the National Rugby League (NRL).\nHe was previously an assistant coach at the Melbourne Storm and the Sydney Roosters.\nCoaching career.\nMelbourne Storm.\nO'Brien started his professional coaching career as an assistant to Brad Arthur with the Melbourne Storm under-20s side before working as a development coach for Melbourne and spending five years alongside Craig Bellamy as an assistant to the NRL side.\nSydney Roosters.\nAfter 11 years at the Melbourne club, O'Brien joined the Sydney Roosters as an attacking coach under head coach Trent Robinson in 2019. He finished his time with the Roosters as a part of their 2019 NRL Grand Final winning team.\nNewcastle Knights.\nIn September 2019, O'Brien signed a three-year contract to become the Head Coach of the Newcastle Knights starting in 2020. Newcastle demonstrated a marked improvement in performance over previous seasons, finishing in 7th place and reaching the first of week of finals. They finished the year with 11 wins, 1 draw and 9 losses. In February 2021, the Newcastle club extended his contract until the end of 2024.\nO'Brien guided Newcastle to a 7th placed finish in the 2021 NRL season as the club qualified for the finals. In the first week of the 2021 Finals Series, Newcastle were defeated 28-20 by Parramatta in the elimination final which ended their season.\nControversy.\nOn 10 February 2021, O'Brien was named as the person involved in an alleged incident at a Newcastle racecourse. It was alleged that O'Brien had the altercation in one of the toilet blocks at the racecourse and had to be ejected from the venue by security. One security guard spoke to the media about the incident saying “The coach was arrogant and belligerent and even used the old, ‘Don’t you know who I am?’ line when we escorted him out of the men’s room and told him to cool it\". This was later refuted by the Newcastle club in a statement which read \"Reports alleging those Knights staff were intoxicated, disruptive and ejected from the venue are incorrect. This has been confirmed by NJC staff and independent eyewitnesses. Information gathered confirms all Knights representatives always acted professionally and appropriately, NJC has confirmed there were no incident reports recorded.\""

        "title": "1923 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1923 season of the Auckland Rugby League was its 15th. The First Grade competition featured 7 teams with the Fire Brigade club who featured in it in 1922 not entering a team.\n \n \nFirst grade winners.\nCity Rovers won their 6th championship title and the 3rd in succession after defeating Athletic 8–7 in the final. With a round to play City was only 2 competition points ahead of Athletic so it was decided to play a final to decide the champions. The match was played on Carlaw Park in front of an enormous crowd of 11,500 with £325 received in gate takings. City were the second team to win three consecutive titles after Ponsonby United had won the competition in 1917, 1918, and 1919. It was to be 61 years until it happened again with Mt Albert winning the title from 1984 to 1986 before Northcote won 4 titles from 1991 to 1994, Glenora 3 titles from 1997 to 1999, and Pt Chevalier won 3 titles from 2013 to 2015.\nPonsonby won the Roope Rooster Knockout competition for the second straight year and their third time in the competitions history after defeating City Rovers 14–3 in the final.\nRepresentative team.\nThe Auckland representative team played 5 matches for 4 wins and a 20–20 draw. The draw was arguably the most significant result as it was in a match for the Northern Union Challenge Cup against South Auckland. Auckland had lost the cup to the same opposition the previous season and as the match was drawn South Auckland retained it. The two teams met again at the end of the season at Carlaw Park which Auckland won convincingly however the cup was not being played for as it was only defended at the holders home ground.\nManukau rugby league team.\nNear the end of the season the Manukau and Māngere clubs sent a letter to the Auckland Rugby League which was read at the management committee meeting on 29 August. It stated that the two clubs had decided to amalgamate and would enter a team in the senior grade the following year provided permission was granted, which it was. The Manukau club is the Manukau club of today, though the Mangere club is not related to the modern day Mangere East who were not founded until 1963. The Manukau club were located in their early decades in the Onehunga area before moving much later to their current location at Moyle Park. The clubs did however remain separate and compete as separate entities the following year. Māngere were previously known as Māngere Rangers however and became known as Māngere United until they ceased to exist at the end of 1934. In the same 1923 season the Manukau Cruising Club decided to enter a team in the 6th B Grade. They played 9 games before withdrawing from the competition despite being relatively competitive. In one of their matches Roy Hardgrave and Ted Brimble played for them when their Manukau teams had a bye.\nMonteith Shield (1st grade championship).\nThe 1923 First Grade Championship was arguably the most keenly fought in the competitions history to this point with three teams in the hunt for the title up until the last two weeks. Marist Old Boys who were in a good position to win the title lost in the 12th and 13th rounds and bowed out of contention, leaving City Rovers and Athletics to contend. It was ultimately won by City Rovers who finished the season with a 10 win and 2 loss record, as did Athletic, with a final being required to determine the winner. City won by the narrowest of margins 8–7 to go back to back.\nMonteith Shield standings.\nA final was played between City Rovers and Athletic after the round robin to decide the title with City winning 8 points to 7 in front of 11,500 spectators at Carlaw Park.\nMonteith Shield fixtures.\nThe First Grade season was particularly close right until the end. In the final round the step was made to play both games on Carlaw Park number 1 field for the first time (usually one match was always played on the number 2 field at the same time). If Athletic had defeated City Rovers in the main match they would have won the championship for the first time however they lost to City which forced a final to be played the following week between the same two teams and City were again victorious to claim their 3rd straight championship.\nRound 1.\nRound 1 saw the debut of centre Hec Brisbane for Marist against Richmond. Brisbane would go on to play 158 games for Marist from 1923 to 1934 scoring 71 tries, mostly in the centre position. He also played for Auckland 14 times from 1923 to 1933 and a remarkable 50 matches for New Zealand from 1924 to 1932. He was also a representative selector in the 1930s after he retired. Scrum half, Wilson Hall also debuted for Atheltic after joining from the Ngaruawahia club. He would go on to transfer to Hornby in Canterbury before being signed by Hull F.C. in 1928. He later played for Castleford and Dewsbury, as well as representing New Zealand on the 1926-27 tour of England.\nRound 8.\nPonsonby defaulted their match with Newton after they could only manage 8 players.\nRound 10.\nRichmond defaulted their match with City as they had a large number of players injured or ill.\nRound 14.\nThe match between City and Athletic saw two forwards ordered off, one from each team. Hec McDonald the future Kiwi debuted for City in the match after being drawn to Auckland from the Waikato.\nRoope Rooster knockout competition.\nThe Roope Rooster competition was interesting as Ponsonby went on to win it despite being uncompetitive in the First Grade competition. Thomas McClymont and Bill Walsh emerged from retirement, and Ivan Littlewood transferred back to the club from Waikato where he had moved, to bolster their team for the Roope Rooster competition. They defeated Richmond and Marist comprehensively before beating a slightly weakened City team (with Maurice Wetherill suffering from influenza, and Bill Davidson with a leg injury) in the final 14–8.\nRound 1.\nAthletic had a forward ordered off early in their match with Devonport United but still managed to lead at halftime before conceding the lead and the match in the second half.\nTop try scorers and point scorers.\nThese lists include tries and points scored in the first grade competition and the Roope Rooster knockout competition. A Goddick of the Devonport who scored 6 tries during the season later moved to Fiji to live and help promote the game of rugby union there.\nOther senior club matches and competitions.\nAthletic v Wednesday representative team.\nDuring the season a Wednesday afternoon competition was played and it was decided to play a match between Athletic who had a bye and a representative team from that competition as curtain-raiser to the City Rovers – Marist Old Boys match.\nLabour Day Carnival and charity sevens tournament.\nOn 20 October there was a carnival held at Carlaw Park with 7 a-side football on one field and seven-a-side rugby league on the other. There were three first round matches played with Richmond, Athletic A, and Devonport victorious. Richmond received a bye in the semi-finals and met Athletic in the final who they defeated 5 points to 0.\nThe following weekend another seven-a-side tournament was held at Carlaw Park to raise money for the Takapuna Orphanage which was destroyed by fire. Unfortunately the weather was particularly bad in the morning which had an effect on the attendance with only 1,000 spectators. The teams were supposed to composed of senior players but in reality were largely made up of junior players.\nExhibition matches.\nOn June 2 Marist had a bye and so travelled to Hamilton to play a local Hamilton representative side. Hamilton won 28-13 against a Marist team missing 5 of its regular players.\nRichmond travelled to Taumarunui towards the end of the season when they had a bye in the First Grade competition and were victorious against the local side by 14 points to 5. On 15 September the Athletic and Parnell 4th grade teams played a match in Whangarei which was the first time and organised game of rugby league had been played in the area. As both of the teams were composed of junior players, the game was not of a high standard and gained little interest.\nLower grades.\nThere were 8 lower grade competitions in 1923 with the 6th grade split into an A and B division, while the Cadets competition ran again and a Wednesday Competition was also run featuring businesses and professions. The Richmond club refused to play any of its scheduled May 5 games in protest at the allocation of venues. The ARL in response decided to replay that their move was ill-timed and unavailing as a protest. And that they should have played the games and then protested in order to be heard.\nSecond grade.\nCity Rovers won the competition after defeating Māngere Rangers 16-3 on September 8. Earlier in the season on June 2 the two sides drew 6-6 but the match was later awarded to Mangere as City had an \"unqualified\" player. The standings are incomplete with most teams playing around 14 matches but less than half were reported. On August 14 with the competition nearing its end the New Zealand Herald reported that Māngere were on 20 points, City 16, and Otahuhu and Kingsland were on 14. City had 2 games in hand and it appears Māngere must have lost their last match with City winning both of there's and forcing a playoff for the competition on September 8, which they won. Māngere won the knockout competition (Foster Memorial Shield). Northcote &amp; Birkenhead Ramblers withdrew after 7 rounds and had defaulted at least two matches to that point.\nThird grade (Myers Cup).\nThe points for the five leading teams was mentioned in an article in the New Zealand Herald on August 14 when City and Manukau had no games remaining while Richmond, Ponsonby, and Point Chevalier each had two games left. After wins by Ponsonby and Point Chevalier they overtook City and Manukau and needed a playoff for the title. Ponsonby United won the competition, defeating Point Chevalier in the final 10-7 on September 15. Ellerslie, Kingsland and Marist all withdrew after round 7. Each of them had defaulted multiple matches prior to this. 16 rounds were played in total but there were few results reported, though the majority of Ponsonby's matches did have their result published. The Victoria Cruising Club entered a team. They were a boating club based in the Westhaven Marina adjacent to the southern end of the Auckland Harbour Bridge.\nFourth grade.\nDevonport United won the championship on September 29 when they beat Athletic 24-5 in the final. Neither team had many of their results reported and therefore the standings are very incomplete although the New Zealand Herald gave the points of the leading teams near the end of the season. Marist withdrew after 6 rounds when they had already defaulted at least 3 matches.\nFifth grade (Endean Memorial Shield).\nRichmond secured the championship when they defeated Newton 11-0 in the final round. Ponsonby withdrew from the competition after 3 rounds when they had defaulted their matches up to this point. Athletic withdrew after 4 rounds when they too had been defaulting matches. There were 14 rounds played but many results were not reported and so the standings are incomplete. Richmond, City, Point Chevalier, Northcote &amp; Birkenhead, and Newton had the majority of their results reported but 5 or 6 not reported in each case. City won the knockout competition when they beat Newton 18-0 on September 29.\nSixth grade A.\nPonsonby won the competition. Newton finished runner up after they beat Parnell 5-3 in the final round. Otahuhu won the Hamill Cup which was the knockout competition trophy when they beat Ponsonby 21-0 on October 20, and then Devonport 21-0 in the final on October 27. There were very few results reported in the championship although the majority of Ponsonby and Athletics results were reported.\nSixth grade B.\nAthletic won the competition. There were many results not reported however after round 15 on August 18 it was reported that City's 10-0 win over Athletic brought them within 1 competition point of Athletic which gave a clue as to several earlier matches played.\nCadet competition.\nThe Cadet competition was won by the 29th Company from Ponsonby. Only around half of the results were reported.\nWednesday Competition.\nThe Post and Telegraph side won the Wednesday Competition which was played for by businesses and professions. Post and Telegraph beat Tramways 16-15 on September 26. On September 13 a Taxi Drivers side beat Bakers 21-9 at Carlaw Park. A Bakers player (T. McPherson) broke his ankle and was taken home). On September 20 the Post and Telegraph side played against the Wednesday representative team as curtain-raiser to the Auckland Province - New South Wales match at Carlaw Park. Post and Telegraph won 33 to 11 with future New Zealand international Arthur Singe scoring 2 tries and kicking a conversion. Wally Somers was also in the Post and Telegraph side.\nRepresentative season.\nThe Auckland representative side played 5 matches. They started the season with a match against Wellington in which they ran up a huge score, winning by 71 points to 12. Their second match was played mid week against Hamilton, before two games against South Auckland and finishing the season with a game against an Auckland provincial team.\nAuckland challenged South Auckland for the Northern Union Cup which it had lost to the same opponents in 2022. The match was drawn and so South Auckland retained the cup. Auckland later played an Auckland provincial team and won comfortably in front of 7,000 spectators on Carlaw Park. A curtain-raiser was played between the Referees Association and the Junior Advisory Board, and was won by the former by 10 points to 6. In the final full league fixture of the season Auckland played South Auckland again and were this time victorious 25 to 11.\nAuckland v Wellington.\nEvery single member of the Auckland team scored points aside from Bill Davidson which was ironic given that he was one of Auckland Rugby League's most prolific point scorers.\nAuckland v Hamilton.\nIn the match with Hamilton which, was played midweek, there were no players from the Ponsonby United and City Rovers clubs available as they were playing the Roope Rooster final on the following Saturday."

        "title": "Clive Davis (rugby union)",
        "text": "Clive Enoch Davis (born September 17, 1949) is a former Welsh international rugby union player.\nDavis played his entire career at Newbridge RFC, gaining county, invitational, and international honors while doing so.\nDavis made his debut for Newbridge on 16 November 1968 against Cheltenham. He was a mainstay in the club throughout the decade, captaining them for three seasons. It wasn't until the 1977–78 season that Davis made his break onto the international scene. The season was full of honors. He became Newbridge's first ‘'B'’ international, playing for Wales B against France in Nantes. He was then selected for the annual Barbarians Easter tour. Davis went on to represent the famous invitational club on eight occasions throughout his career, scoring two tries. The 1978 season ended with Davis being selected for the 1978 Wales rugby union tour of Australia.\nDavis represented the Welsh team in five games during the tour. He was to win his long overdue cap during the final game of the tour, the 2nd test match played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The Welsh back row had a different look about it, J. P. R. Williams was on one flank with Stuart Lane, while on the other, Davis took on the No. 8 responsibilities. The match was extensively physical with several brawls breaking out on the field. Wales prop Graham Price broke his jaw. Australia ended up winning the game by 19 points to 17.\nDavis kept his place in the Wales squad for the next two seasons but did not get playing opportunities. At the end of the 1979–80 season, he was selected to tour North America with the Welsh XV. During the tour, he played in four games, including the uncapped tests against both the US and Canada.\nThe 1980–81 season was the Welsh Rugby Union's centenary season. Davis once again found himself in the Welsh squad. He won his second cap in the first game of the championship, against England at the National Stadium in Cardiff. The match was a close affair with the boot dominating. Wales won the game 21–19 with Davis scoring the only Welsh try of the game, the first time a Newbridge player had scored in a full international. The team that traveled to Murrayfield was unchanged, however, a poor performance saw Scotland run out winners by 18 points to 6. The defeat brought about several changes and ended the international careers of J. P. R. Williams, Steve Fenwick, Brynmor Williams, and Clive Davis.\nDavis retired at the end of the 1982–83 season. The season ended with a tour to France representing another invitational team, Crawshays RFC. \nAfter retiring, David went on to coach Oakdale, Newbridge and Ebbw Vale.\nTest debut Australia vs Wales at Sydney, 17 June 1978&lt;br&gt; \nLast Test Scotland vs Wales at Murrayfield, 7 February 1981\nReferences.\n Rothmans Rugby Yearbook 1981-82 Vivian Jenkins (1982) pg68 "

        "text": "The 2019 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby was a home run hitting contest between eight batters from Major League Baseball (MLB). The derby was held on July 8, 2019, at Progressive Field in Cleveland, OH, the site of the 2019 MLB All-Star Game. In an effort to lure more big name players to the Derby compared to previous seasons, MLB increased the winner's prize to $1 million with the total pool money being increased to $2.5 million, up from $525,000 in 2018.\nThe longest home run, amongst the total 312 hit by the 8 players involved, covered a distance of , and was hit by the runner-up of the contest, Vladimir Guerrero Jr.\nThis was the first derby since the format change in 2015 to feature tie-breaking rounds, as Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Joc Pederson went to a record three swing-offs in the second round. Additionally, Guerrero Jr. surpassed the previous first and second round records for home runs hit by Josh Hamilton in 2008 and Kyle Schwarber in 2018 respectively. Winner Pete Alonso of the New York Mets hit 23 home runs in the final round, also breaking the final round total set by Giancarlo Stanton in 2016. The total tally of 312 home runs is the most in the history of the event.\nRules.\nEight players participate in the derby in a bracket-style, single-elimination timed event. Each player has four minutes to hit as many home runs as possible. Hitters are awarded an additional 30 seconds if they hit two home runs over . Hitters are also allowed one 45 second timeout to stop the clock (two in the finals).\nThe eight competing players are seeded 1-8 based on their home run totals. While the lower seed hits first, the higher seed hits second in all rounds. The round ends if the higher seed exceeds the total of the first hitter. In the event of a tie, two sets of tiebreakers are employed: first, a 1-minute swing-off (with no timeouts nor bonus time awarded); thereafter, multiple three-swing sets will occur until the tie is broken.\nBracket.\nBy June 30, 2019, Toronto Blue Jays third baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Cleveland Indians first baseman Carlos Santana, New York Mets first baseman Pete Alonso, Pittsburgh Pirates first baseman Josh Bell, Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich, and Atlanta Braves outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. had agreed to participate in the derby. However, on July 7, 2019, Yelich was forced to withdraw from the derby due to a back injury. As a result, Oakland Athletics third baseman Matt Chapman was selected by the league to replace Yelich. Guerrero set a new single-round record with 29 home runs in the first round, and he and Joc Pederson matched the feat in round two. Both Guerrero and Pederson tied with eight home runs in a tiebreaker, matched with one home run in a three-swing swing-off, before Guerrero prevailed in a second swing-off by a score of 2–1."

        "text": "The Global Women's Basketball Association (GWBA) is a women's professional basketball league operating in the Midwest region of the United States. The league was founded in 2016 and features four teams. GWBA rosters are composed primarily of former collegiate players, often playing for the team nearest their former school, and former WNBA players.\nHistory.\nThe league was established in 2016 by Sonya Nichols, a former basketball player for the James Madison Dukes. The inaugural season began with four teams: the Flint Monarchs, Milwaukee Aces, Akron Innovators, and Illinois Starletz. The Monarchs finished the season undefeated and won the league championship. The 2017 season saw teams play eight games instead of seven; the Monarchs again won the championship. Following the 2018 season, which was again won by the Monarchs, the league added two teams: the Wisconsin Glo and St. Louis Surge. The Glo finished their inaugural season undefeated and won the league championship, defeating the three-time defending champions Monarchs. The 2020 season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2021, the Music City Icons were replaced by the Detroit Dodgers, who ultimately forfeited the season as they were unable to field a roster. The Surge finished the regular season in first place but were upset by the Glo in the championship."

        "text": "The 2018 World Women's Snooker Championship was a women's snooker tournament that took place at the Dolmen Hotel, St. Paul's Bay, in Malta from 14 to 17 March 2018. Defending champion Ng On-yee won the event with a 5–0 win against Maria Catalano in the final. Ng On-yee won the title without losing a single frame over all six of her matches and as champion, qualified to enter the 2018 World Snooker Championship.\nThis was the first time that the snooker world championship for women was organised under the banner of the World Snooker Federation (WSF). The WSF was formed in October 2017, supported by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association and the European Billiards and Snooker Association. The event saw a slightly increased prize fund, with the winner receiving ,000.\nPrize fund.\nThe breakdown of prize money for the event is shown below:\nOverview.\nThe event featured 24 participants and was open to players nominated by their national federations, if the federations were members of the World Snooker Federation by 1 March 2018. The top 30 ranked players (as calculated following the 2018 British Open) were eligible to be nominated. Each National Federation (NF) was able to nominate up to four additional players to take part, as well as those in the top 30 of the rankings. The participants featured five from England; four from Hong Kong and from Poland; two each from Belgium, Brazil, Ireland, and Thailand; and one from Australia, Netherlands and Wales.\nOf the players in the top 30 in the world rankings, the following players competed in the world championships: Laura Evans, Maria Catalano, Ng On-yee, Paula Judge, Reanne Evans, Rebecca Kenna, Ronda Sheldreck, Suzie Opacic. In addition, sixteen players were added from outside of the top 30 players: Ewelina Pislewska, Fatima Gusso Rigoni, Inge Vermeulen, Jaique Ip Wan In, Jacqueline Ellis, Joanna Grochal, Judy Dangerfield, Katarzyna Bialik, Malgorzata Sikorska, Manon Melief, Mei Mei Fong, Nicolly Christo, Nutcharut Wongharuthai, Waratthanun Sukritthanes, Wendy Jans, Yee Ting Cheung.\nTournament summary.\nIn the group stage, Ng On-yee, Reanne Evans, and Waratthanun Sukritthanes all won their groups without losing a frame. Wendy Jans made a highest break of 110 against Suzie Opacic, which turned out to be the only century break of the tournament. All four players from Hong Kong reached the knockout stages, but three of them lost in their first knockout matches.\nIn the quarter-finals and semi-finals, only the semi-final between Reanne Evans and Maria Catalano went to a deciding frame, with Catalano the surprising winner. Rebecca Kenna reached the semi-finals for the third year in a row.\nNg On-yee's 5–0 whitewashing of Catalano in the final meant Ng On-yee had won the title for the third time, this time having won six matches and a total of 22 frames throughout the tournament without conceding any. This was despite Ng On-yee having low expectations at the start of the tournament, as she was feeling under pressure, suffering from loss of form, and ill with a cough.\nIn addition to the trophy and title, winning provided Ng On-yee with a place in the qualifying rounds of the 2018 World Snooker Championship, her previous two attempts at the World Snooker Championship having both ended at the first match.\nResults.\nGroup stage.\nThe group stage began 14 March 2018, with six groups of four players. Each match was played as a best-of-5-. The top two players from each group qualified for the knockout round. Progression from the group stages was determined, by: matches won; head-to-head results; frames won; highest break; and lastly ranking position.\nMain draw.\nThe numbers in parentheses are players' seedings. Players listed in bold indicate match winner. "

        "title": "1921 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1921 season of Auckland Rugby League was its 13th. Seventy two teams played across its six main grades.\n \n \nThe first grade competition featured seven teams, City Rovers, Marist Old Boys, Maritime, Devonport, Fire Brigade (formerly Grafton Athletic), Newton Rangers, and Ponsonby United. City Rovers comfortably won the senior championship for the 4th time with a 8 win, 1 draw, 0 loss record ahead of Maritime who were unable to repeat their title win from the previous season. City had previously won the title in 1910, 1911, and 1916. This was to be the first of 3 consecutive titles for them. They also won the Roope Rooster knockout competition for the 3rd time after previous wins in 1916 and 1918.\nNews.\nJunior Management Committee.\nThe Junior management committee elected for the season was: G. Stevens, W. Church, J. Ball, H. Clayton, W. Dowle, A.E. Smith, W. Lusty, W.J. Davidson (Hon. Sec), T. Fielding (Chairman), J. Aggers, K. Lippiatt.\nClub name changes and mergers.\nOn 13 April the Management Committee of the Auckland Rugby League met. At the meeting Grafton was granted permission to change its name to \"Fire Brigade Club\". Devonport United notified the league that the Devonport Borough Council had allocated the Devonport Domain for its use. During the season the club was named 'North Shore' and 'Devonport' interchangeably by both \"The New Zealand Herald\" and the \"Auckland Star\". In 1920 the club had seen a merger between North Shore Albions and the Sunnyside club and agreed on the name Devonport United but it appears that the stronger club's name was still more favoured by those reporting on the games, and it was eventually the name adopted by the club. While the Kingsland Rovers club wrote asking for advice on what it should do regarding a ground for the club to play at.\nCarlaw Park open for business.\n Carlaw Park was named after James Carlaw who had been heavily involved in the development of rugby league in the Auckland area for many years. History was made on 25 June when the first ever match was played on Carlaw Park between City Rovers and Maritime. The match was won by City Rovers 10 points to 8. Prior to the match an official opening ceremony was held. \"The park was declared open by Hon. Arthur Myers, MP. Mr and Mrs. Carlaw were each presented with a gold badge and certificate of life membership on the ground, and at the conclusion of the ceremony Mrs Carlaw kicked off for the first game on the new park\". City Rovers capped a remarkable season by winning the Thacker Shield from Ponsonby United on the final day of the season after having already won the Monteith Shield by winning the First Grade Championship, and the Roope Rooster Knock-out trophy.\nFemale football club denied by the league.\nOn 12 July a meeting was held in Parnell to form a \"girls\" rugby league competition with over 40 enrolling. They were to play a game on Carlaw Park on the following Saturday afternoon. They were all aged between 16 and 20 years of age. The chairman of the Parnell club, Mr. A.R. Turner explained \"that it wished to develop the girls as well as the men, and to this end the club was being formed at the suggestion of the girls\". A trophy \"similar to the Monteith Shield\" had been donated, and \"members of the Auckland League Management Committee had donated a football, and were providing assistance in supplying jerseys. At the meeting when the time for enrollment came it was described that \"they rose in a body and fairly rushed the table, which was in danger of being overturned in the excitement of the moment\" Ivan Culpan, secretary of the league told the girls that the league would train them every evening in the lead up to the match. Over the next week the number of girls enrolled increased to 65. It later transpired that the members of the Auckland Rugby League who had attended had done so by invitation and were not necessarily acting on behalf of the league with the comments they had made. At the Auckland Rugby league Management meeting the following night the decision on whether to support the girls playing and affiliate the club with the league was deferred. Both George Hunt and E Phelan spoke against allowing the girls to play. And at a meeting on 20 July the Auckland Rugby League decided to oppose the girls playing football. Mr. James Carlaw said that medical opinion was in opposition to females playing the sport. Mr Stallworthy and Mr. E. Feilding suggested a trial game with modified rules take place with doctors watching but the request was declined.\nArthur Singe switches to rugby league.\nAt the beginning of the season Marist Old Boys enticed Arthur Singe to join the club. He was an outstanding rugby player playing in the wing-forward position (flanker in today's terms). He played for the New Zealand Army rugby team which toured Great Britain and then South Africa at the end of the war. When he returned to New Zealand he played for the Marist rugby club and played for Auckland 8 teams. He narrowly missed the New Zealand rugby team to tour Australia after playing just 10 minutes in the North Island v South Island match which acted as a trial of sorts. He switched codes and joined Marist, playing for them in 1921–22 and 1925–26 before going on tour with the New Zealand team on their ill-fated tour of England. Seven players went on strike due to issues with management on the tour and were ultimately banned for life. Singe was the only Auckland player among the strikers. The ban was lifted in 1962, 26 years after his death in 1936. Singe was to play 48 games for Marist scoring 148 points, 15 games for Auckland scoring 25 points, and 8 matches for New Zealand.\nMonteith Shield (first grade championship).\nMonteith Shield fixtures.\nRound 1.\n Arthur Singe debuted for Marist. His mother was Irish and father Chinese, making him the first ever player of Asian heritage in New Zealand representative rugby league along with James Hing who played in the same era for Marist and later coached Point Chevalier. Singe had played for the New Zealand Army team during World War 1 and narrowly missed out on selection for the All Blacks in 1920. He was a magnificent loose forward and went on to play for Auckland and New Zealand. On the 1926-27 tour of England he was one of several players who boycotted matches due to a disagreement with the coach/manager and was suspended for several matches. Following the tour he was banned for life by the New Zealand Rugby League, though the ban was renounced many years later. Singe had died in the mid 1930's however.\nRound 4.\n Ivan Littlewood debuted for Maritime and scored a try in their 12-10 win over Newton. He went on to represent Auckland 22 times from 1921 to 1927 and played for New Zealand in 1 test match in 1925. He was a consistent try scorer with 80 tries from 120 club games from 1921 to 1934.\nRound 6.\nRound 6 was somewhat farcical. Devonport fielded several juniors and when the score got to 14–0 in favour of Maritime very quickly four Maritime players changed teams to make it a more even contest. The remainder of the game more resembled a practice match. While Newton defaulted their match with Fire Brigade as only 6 players turned out. The \"New Zealand Herald\" match report stated that \"counter-attractions proving too strong for the Newton players\".\nRound 8.\nJohn Lang, who had switched to rugby union weeks earlier was denied reinstated reinstatement in that code. As a result he returned to rugby league and joined the Marist club, making his debut in their game against City. He went on to represent them for 4 seasons and also made several appearances for Auckland while a Marist member.\nRound 9.\nRound 9 saw the opening of Carlaw Park and the first ever match played on its soil. City defeated Maritime by 10 points to 8 in front of 7000 spectators. Herb Lunn of the Maritime side had the honour of scoring the first try on the ground. The other two matches for this round were postponed. The captains of both Newton and Devonport decided to postpone the match, though the majority of the Devonport players were unaware of this arrangement and arrived at the ground ready to play. While on the same day the Fire Brigade players were called to a warehouse fire in the city at mid-day and were tired and late arriving to the ground so the match was abandoned.\nRound 11.\nThe City v Newton game was discontinued at halftime due to the score line. Newton had started the match a man short and the score line had already blown out to 37–5 by the interval.\nRoope Rooster knockout competition.\nThe first round match between Marist Old Boys and Maritime ended controversially with Marist complaining that the match had finished early (when they were trailing by 10 points to 8). They protested and the match was replayed with Maritime winning 21 to 10. The referee in charge, Walter Ripley announced his resignation in the following week but did referee again for several years and later served on the board of the Referee's Association.\nThe final was won by City Rovers who defeated Maritime in the final in front of a large crowd by 30 points to 14. Over £230 were taken at the gate which was a record for Carlaw Park, albeit in its first season of use. From this 50 percent went to the Auckland League Sick and Injured Players' Fund, 25 percent to the Hospital Radium Fund, and 25 percent to the St. John Ambulance Association.\nTop try scorers and point scorers.\nBill Davidson's point total includes senior matches in the championship and the Roope Rooster.\nOther club matches.\nChallenge Shield.\nThe Thacker Shield was held by Ponsonby United coming into the 1921 season however there was a dispute over whether the shield should be held by North Island teams as it was unclear if it had been intended for competition among South Island teams only. The New Zealand council decided that the rules should be amended to allow North Island teams to hold it but the donor, Dr. H.T.J. Thacker and the Canterbury Rugby League would not agree to them. As such the shield was returned to the donor. Mr. C Weaver donated a trophy to take its place and this became known as the Challenge Shield and it was this that Ponsonby went on to defend twice. They first hosted Petone from Wellington who they beat 18–13. In the curtain-raiser Petone juniors were defeated by Richmond by 14 points to 8. In the evening the Petone players were entertained at the Druids' Hall by the Ponsonby club and Auckland League. They later defeated Huntly 19–8 before losing the Shield to local rivals City Rovers\nLower grades.\nThere were 7 lower grades in 1921.\nSecond grade.\nNewton defeated Maritime in the second grade final by 17 points to 11 at Carlaw Park to win the Second Grade Cup. Future New Zealand representative Charles Gregory played for Newton. They ultimately finished the season with a 10 win, 1 draw, 1 loss record, scoring 149 points and conceding 57. North Shore withdrew prior to round 2, Marist withdrew after round 8, Manukau after round 10, and City after round 11. There were very few results reported and Newton's win/loss and for and against record was learned from their championship team photograph.\nThird grade (Myers Cup).\nKingsland Rovers won the competition when they drew with Newton 9-9 on August 6 in round 12. Future New Zealand international Claude List was in the Kingsland side, aged 18. In the first 5 rounds many results were reported however the second half of the season had very few reported. Parnell entered a team in the knockout competition which began on August 13 and had a 3-3 draw with Ellerslie. Marist were scheduled to play Ellerslie in round 1 but there was no result reported and they withdrew from the competition after this.\nFourth grade.\nOtahuhu won the championship though not all results were reported.\nFifth grade.\nCity Rovers defeated Richmond by 5 points to 2 to win the championship. There were very few results reported during the season. Marist entered 2 teams however their B team withdrew after round 3. Kingsland withdrew after round 11, and North Shore and Manukau after round 12. Parnell entered a team late in the season to play a friendly match.\nSixth grade A.\nRichmond won the competition. There were very few results reported during the season. Parnell entered a team in the competition on July 23 though it is unclear if their 5 matches counted towards the championship. Only one of their results was reported, a 9-2 loss to Maritime.\nSixth grade B.\nPonsonby won the competition. There were almost no results reported beyond round 6, with only 3 of Ponsonby's results reported. Parnell entered a team on July 16 and played 3 matches. It is unclear if their matches contributed to the final standings, the only game that had a result reported for them was a 33-0 loss to Ponsonby.\nCadet competition.\nThis was the first year that a cadet competition had been played. The 18th Company won the competition. The 34th Cadets were based in Mt Eden while the 51st Senior Cadets were based in Devonport. This competition was won by the 18th Company of Senior Cadets after they won the final game of the season defeating the 13th Company by 7 points to 2. The 23rd Company played a match with the 37th Company which they won 19 to 0. This match was outside of the competition.\nAuckland representative fixtures.\nIt was a very busy season for the Auckland representative team with ten matches played. Though in reality B and C teams played some of the fixtures as matches were played at the same time in different centres. They won seven matches and lost three. On 20 August Auckland played three matches, which showed off their depth. One at Carlaw Park versus King Country, one in Hamilton against South Auckland, and one against Wellington on the Basin Reserve. They won against King Country and Wellington, with a loss against South Auckland.\nHawkes Bay v Auckland.\nThe Auckland team was mentioned as \"Auckland B\" in 2 sources however they were named as Auckland on multiple occasions and was essentially the same team which played South Auckland the week prior where it was considered Auckland and therefore they have been considered a full Auckland side.\nAuckland representative matches played and scorers.\nBill Williams began the season playing for Newton Rangers however after they were struggling for numbers and defaulted a game he transferred to the Fire Brigade team where he played 3 matches in June and July.\nNew Zealand representatives from Auckland.\nTeam to tour Australia\nBacks\nForwards"

        "title": "List of NCAA Division I basketball career triple-doubles leaders",
        "text": "In basketball, a triple-double is defined as a performance in which one player accumulates a double-digit total in three of five positive statistical categories—points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocked shots—in a game. The most common way for a player to achieve a triple-double is with points, rebounds, and assists, though on occasion players may record 10 or more steals or blocked shots in a game. Each player on this list has accomplished this feat at least five times in a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's or women's game.\nIndividual scoring totals have been recognized as official NCAA statistics throughout what it calls the \"modern era\" of men's basketball, which it considers to have started with the 1937–38 season, the first without the center jump after each made basket. Individual rebounding was added in the 1950–51 season. Similarly, the NCAA has recognized the same statistics in women's basketball since it began sponsoring competition in that sport in the 1981–82 season. However, official recognition of the other possible components of the triple-double did not come until later. In men's basketball, the NCAA first kept individual assist totals in the 1950–51 season, but discontinued the practice after the 1951–52 season, not resuming until 1983–84. Blocked shots and steals became official men's statistics in 1985–86. In women's basketball, assists became an official Division I statistic in 1985–86, with blocks and steals following in 1987–88. Both the men's and women's lists include only triple-doubles that are officially recognized by the NCAA.\nThrough the 2023–24 season, the career record for triple-doubles in Division I men's basketball is held by BYU's Kyle Collinsworth with 12. On the women's Division I side, Sabrina Ionescu of Oregon holds the record with 26. The only active players with five or more triple-doubles through the end of 2023–24 are Western Carolina's Vonterius Woolbright (6) and Utah's Deivon Smith (5).\nThe lone program to have had more than one player record five or more career triple-doubles is the Iowa women's program, with Caitlin Clark joined by Samantha Logic. The only other school to have had more than one player accomplish this feat is Saint Mary's, with Brian Shaw having split his college career between Saint Mary's and UC Santa Barbara, and Louella Tomlinson having played her entire college career at Saint Mary's.\nMen.\n\"Current through the end of the 2023–24 season.\""

        "title": "Boxing on Fox",
        "text": "Boxing on Fox refers to a series of boxing events produced by Fox Sports and televised by the Fox Broadcasting Company and Fox Sports 1.\nHistory.\n\"Saturday Night Fights\" (1995).\nFox's first foray into boxing aired on December 16, 1995 in prime time headlined by a bout between Mike Tyson and Buster Mathis Jr.\nOn September 14, Tyson promoter Don King would stun the boxing world by announcing that the Tyson–Mathis match would be broadcast for free on Fox. Three weeks before the fight, Tyson suffered a broken thumb, but did not announce it until November 1, three days before the fight. In a press conference at the MGM Grand, Tyson announced the cancellation of the fight because of the injury. Then, on November 22, it was announced that the bout had been moved to Atlantic City with a December 16 date in place and that Showtime would air the fight instead of Fox. Plans were changed after New Jersey gaming authorities ruled against having the fight in Atlantic City because Don King had been under suspension in New Jersey since 1994 because of legal troubles. On November 30, Philadelphia's CoreStates Spectrum was announced to host the fight with Fox regaining the rights to air it.\nThe opening match on the card involved Terry Norris and Paul Vaden. Also featured was Frankie Randall defending his World Boxing Association junior welterweight title against Juan Coggi.\nKevin Harlan provided blow-by-blow commentary, with Sean O'Grady and Bobby Czyz on analysis, and James Brown as the host. Meanwhile, Fox's then lead NFL color commentator, John Madden conducted a taped interview with Tyson. Madden's \"NFL on Fox\" broadcast partner, Pat Summerall was initially scheduled to call the card, but when it was pushed back from November 4 to December 16, his NFL duties interfered with him participating.\nFox received a 16.9 Nielsen overnight rating and 29 share for the December 16 broadcast, making it the highest-rated night in Fox's then brief history as a network.\n\"Oscar De La Hoya's Fight Night\" (1998).\nIn March 1998, Fox teamed with Oscar De La Hoya for a three-fight card from Mashantucket, Connecticut in prime time. Since De La Hoya himself, was under contract to fight exclusively on HBO, he couldn't fight. Instead, the card featured Yory Boy Campas fighting Anthony Stephens in a junior middleweight title bout, Eric \"Butterbean\" Esch in a super heavyweight fight against Bill Eaton, and a six-round women's match between Lucia Rijker and Mary Ann Almager. The card aired directly against the 70th Academy Awards on ABC.\nJames Brown called the action with Gil Clancy on analysis and Sean O'Grady reporting. The telecast garnered Fox a 4.3 rating (5.9 million viewers).\n\"Golden Boy Live!\" (2012-2015).\nThe March 20, 1998 event wouldn't be the last time that Fox would collaborate with Oscar De La Hoya. In April 2012, Fox reached a multi-year agreement with De La Hoya's Golden Boy Promotions. Under terms of the agreement Golden Boy Promotions would stage one event per month in the United States to be simulcast on Fox Deportes, Fox Sports' regional networks and Fuel TV.\nOne year later, Fox announced that they had reached a multi-media rights extension with Golden Boy Promotions. Under this particular agreement, Fox Sports retained exclusive domestic rights to 48 live two-hour events (featuring two or three fights per event). Fox Sports 1 scheduled 24 live events per year, with Fox Deportes airing all 48 events live. This was an increase from 36 in the previous deal. The 24 events on FS1 would all originate in the United States, and most were expected to run on Monday nights once the network launched later that August.\n\"Premier Boxing Champions\" (2015-present).\nOn August 4, 2015, Fox Sports 1 announced that it would air 21 \"PBC\" cards on Tuesday nights (\"Toe-to-Toe Tuesdays\") on the network from September 8, 2015 through June 2016. The telecasts were also simulcast in Spanish by Fox Deportes. The announcement came following the end of a contract between Fox Sports and Golden Boy Promotions.\nBy 2018, most of PBC's broadcasting agreements lapsed. In September 2018, PBC reached a four-year deal with Fox Sports, covering a series of 10 \"marquee\" cards per-year on the Fox broadcast network, 12 per-year on FS1, as well as Fox-produced pay-per-view events. Unlike the previous time-buy arrangements, Fox is paying rights fees; \"The Ring\" reported that Fox was paying $60 million per-year. Prior to the announcement, PBC reached a long-term deal with Showtime, through 2021. Both Fox and Showtime also began producing pay-per-view events (contrary to PBC's previous aversion to them).\nCommentators.\nMeanwhile, Fox Deportes tapped International Boxing Hall of Fame member and former four-division world champion Erik “El Terrible” Morales to work alongside Jaime Motta (blow-by-blow) and Jessi Losada."

        "title": "1919 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1919 season of the Auckland Rugby League was its 11th. It was the first season post World War I and unsurprisingly it saw a resurgence in playing numbers with 56 teams across the six grades. North Shore Albions who had previously dropped out of the senior competition again fielded a senior side. As did Otahuhu, who had dropped out during the 1917 season. Ponsonby United won their third consecutive first grade title, while Newton Rangers won the Roope Rooster trophy.\nThe season was also summarised by the league as well. Forty-nine teams were entered across all grades. Sunnyside won the second grade, Manukau won the third grade, City won the fourth and fifty grades, while Ponsonby won the sixth grade. It was stated that the standard of play in the senior club competition was not as good as it would have been due to the fact that 19 of the best club players from Auckland were away for a large part of the season representing New Zealand in Australia.\nClub news.\nMarist Old Boys enter first grade.\nA new club was formed, namely Marist Old Boys. They were composed of old boys of the Marist Brothers’ schools. They had initially included many members of the Railways rugby side of 1917 who fell out with the Auckland Rugby Union and in 1918 played under the umbrella of the Grafton Athletic club. While they would go on to wear the famous green of Marist in this initial year they took the field in blue jerseys. The senior club season commenced on 3 May.\nEden Ramblers club folds and Point Chevalier is founded.\nAt the Auckland Rugby League meeting on 30 April it was announced that the Eden Ramblers club had been disbanded. They had formed in 1911 and played in the senior competition from 1911 to 1913 before becoming a lower grade club until this season. Curiously though 3 weeks earlier on April 5 however it was reported that a \"new club that has just been affiliated is the Eden Ramblers, boys from Avondale and Point Chevalier\". The new team however was not to become known as the Eden Ramblers but in fact were named Point Chevalier. Point Chevalier however did not field any teams in the 1919 season and it wasn't until the 1920 season that they were officially registered with the league.\nCharitable efforts and league funds.\nDuring the war most of the revenue gained by Auckland Rugby League was donated to the war efforts meaning they could not make much progress financially towards developing the game and facilities. In 1919 they once again raised 75 pounds to distribute to local charities nominated by the mayor. They also put on a match at the end of the season to raise money for the St. John Ambulance Brigade. Due to the large crowds at some of the matches, including the match with Australia it was anticipated that the league would gain over 1,000 pounds to establish a fund for obtaining a playing ground. This would of course be Carlaw Park.\nScrum rules.\nAt the end of the season J.B. Cooke stated in a meeting that next season the ball would be rolled into scrums and forwards would have to keep their feet on the ground while the halfback was putting the ball in. These changes were to “brighten the game”.\nRepresentative season.\nThe Auckland representative team was only able to play one inter provincial fixture against Hawkes Bay after matches with Canterbury and Wellington were unable to be scheduled due to the busy New Zealand representative schedule. Likewise Ponsonby were unable to schedule a defense of the Thacker Shield for the same reason. An Auckland Junior team was however able to make a trip out to Napier to play Hawkes Bay and they were victorious by 12 points to 5. Auckland played a match in front of an enormous crowd at the Auckland Domain against the touring Australian side but did not fair any better than the New Zealand national side, going down by 32 points to 8.\nMyers Cup (1st Grade championship).\nOtahuhu's first grade team were to only last one round into the season before pulling out. Grafton also struggled to field a team when they lost players to the New Zealand team which was touring Australia. In round 6 rather than default they were provided with players from the City and Newton clubs however they too did not survive to the end of the competition. Ponsonby United won the championship for the third consecutive season.\nMyers Cup results.\nRound 1.\nRound 1 saw the senior rugby league debut of Frank Delgrosso. He had played for Ponsonby rugby seniors in 1918 at the age of 18 but switched codes at the start of the season. Delgrosso would go on to become a New Zealand rugby league international in 1921 and play for New Zealand 42 times. He also played for the North Island 3 times and played 23 matches for Auckland including several as captain. Delgrosso also captained Ponsonby and played a remarkable 184 games for them from 1919 to 1934. At the end of his career he also began coaching their senior side and continued coaching into the 1940s. In 1934 he also coached both the Taranaki and Auckland sides in representative matches. He was later inducted into the Auckland rugby league hall of fame.\nRound 4.\nThere was confusion with the Round 4 draw with the newspapers listing the match between North Shore and Maritime when in fact it was Newton who were supposed to be the opponent. As a result, Newton players did not arrive at the ground. Eventually Newton found enough substitutes but they still began the game 2–3 players short. In spite of this they still managed to win by 14 points to 9. Also the City team took the field with 6 juniors while Grafton had 2 juniors and played a man short. The chief issue was with the New Zealand team touring Australia at the time meaning many key players were absent from their club teams. The Marist club was having trouble assembling a full thirteen players in its inaugural and their captain, Con McDevitt requested a postponement of their match with Ponsonby at the mid week ARL meeting and the request was granted.\nRound 5.\nIn the match at Devonport the Marist team was led from the field by their captain, Con McDevitt with the score at 9–0 to North Shore in protest at a refereeing decision. After hearing the report of referee, Mr Cleal, and a statement from McDevitt, it was decided to suspend McDevitt for 12 months after it was he who had told the referee that he would be taking his team from the field in protest after the awarding of North Shore's third try and proceeded to do so. Cleal had said that the match to that point had been a \"disgrace\". McDevitt appealed to the New Zealand Rugby League however a few weeks later however the ARL decided as a Peace Day gesture to lift the ban. \nRound 6.\nGrafton were not able to field a full team and were reinforced by players from Newton who had a bye. This was done so that they would not be forced to drop out of the competition. They were missing test players Karl Ifwersen and Dougie McGregor. Marist continued their difficult season with a heavy defeat and took the field with only 11 players.\nRound 7.\nNelson Bass debuted for Newton. He was selected for New Zealand in the same year and played 7 matches for them from 1919 to 1921. He would ultimately play 20 games for Newton before transferring to Marist in 1922 where he played 24 games over 2 seasons and then moved once more to City Rovers where he played 44 games over 4 seasons before suffering a career ending knee injury. Bass also played 21 games for Auckland and 2 for Auckland Province.\nRound 9.\nThe Auckland Star reported that the matches at Victoria Park saw the largest crowds for club games ever on that ground.\nRound 10.\nRound 10 featured two rarities. The Newton v North Shore match was played as a curtain-raiser to the Ponsonby v Maritime match on Auckland Domain 1. When matches were normally played at the same venue they all were played at the same time of 3pm on adjacent fields. In the 3rd match due to be played on the Domain the referee, Frank Thompson failed to turn up and after waiting for 40 minutes the decision was made to abandon the game. It was later revealed that he had been called away on an urgent business matter and had tried to contact the league but been unable to. The Auckland Rugby League accepted his explanation. The round was also significant for another reason. Craddock Dufty debuted for Newton and kicked 2 conversions. He was to go on to represent New Zealand along with touring with the New Zealand Maori side.\nRoope Rooster knockout competition.\nThe round 1 match between Ponsonby United and Newton Rangers was abandoned towards the end with Newton leading by 12 points to 10 after Ponsonby supporters encroached on the field in protest against the referee and refused to move back. Marist Old Boys recorded their first competitive win in their history with a round 1 win over North Shore Albions. The final was won by Newton Rangers after they defeated Maritime by 8 points to 5.\nRound 1.\nIn the Newton match with Ponsonby there was no crossbar and so they tied a piece of string between the two posts to act as a makeshift marker for kicks at goal. In the Marist Memories book produced by the Marist club for their Golden Jubilee the Robinson brothers who played for Marist were in fact the Nunn brothers from Wellington. The story was retold by Bill Glover senior 50 years later that they were trying to avoid detection from the military police and gave aliases to the police. The Marist team featured several new players in their surprising win which was their first ever in first grade competition.\nSemi final.\nFormer New Zealand international Bob Mitchell had joined the Marist side and scored a try in their narrow loss.\nTop try scorers and point scorers.\nThe following point scoring lists include Senior Championship matches and the Roope Rooster competition matches only. George Davidson the champion New Zealand sprinter, who represented New Zealand at the 1920 Olympics top scored with 64 points and he also led the league with 14 tries.\nSeveral teams featured multiple players with the same surname with many sets of brothers. As a result, some of the scoring lists are inaccurate. For Ponsonby Laurie Cadman scored 1, his brother Arthur Cadman scored 2, and \"Cadman\" scored 3. Laurie was also a boxer and in June 11 or 12, 1925 he disappeared from the Manaia steamer which was traveling from Tauranga to Auckland. His body was never found.\nLower grades.\nThere were 5 lower grades in 1919. In the middle of the season the Post &amp; Telegraph Football Club asked to be affiliated to the Maritime Football Club which had been formed a year earlier. This request was approved by the league.\nSecond grade.\nSunnyside won the championship after an 8-8 draw with City Rovers in the last round of the season. Sunnyside had been leading the competition at the time with City in second place. The City club asked for a rematch but were refused by the Junior Management Committee. Thames Old Boys, Marist Old Boys, and Newton Rangers all withdrew after round 2 with Marist and Newton defaulting their matches. There were 22 scores/results reported, with 26 scores/results not reported therefor the standings are considerably incomplete.\nThird grade.\nThe third grade initially had 6 teams entered but several withdrew during the season and only Northcote and Manukau completed the season. Manukau won the competition and were undefeated however there were only 3 scores reported in the entire season (Northcote 0 Ponsonby 0, Manukau 18 Otahuhu 0, and Otahuhu 13 Ponsonby 0). Otahuhu also recorded a default win over Sunnyside in round 1 with the Sunnyside team then withdrawing from the competition. Thames Old Boys withdrew after round 2, Otahuhu following round 6, and Ponsonby following round 7. This left Northcote and Manukau to play each other on July 5, July 12, and July 19 before the competition stopped. None of these results were reported. \nFourth grade.\nCity were reported to have finished one point ahead of Otahuhu and Maritime. Then followed Sunnyside, Richmond, and Northcote. Though there were a large number of results not reported so the table is incomplete. During the season the Post &amp; Telegraph club affiliated with the Maritime Football Club and subsequently assumed that name. Grafton Athletic withdrew after 6 rounds, as did Manukau.\nFifth grade.\nCity Rovers won the competition. Sunnyside withdrew after the first round after defaulting their match with City. Newton and Maritime withdrew from the competition after 2 rounds. At the time the Maritime team was in fact Post &amp; Telegraph, but their club became affiliated with the Maritime Football Club mid season.\nSixth grade.\nPonsonby United were one competition point ahead of City when they then beat them 7-3 in the curtain-raiser to the 3rd test between New Zealand and Australia. This was the penultimate round and sealed the championship for Ponsonby. Sunnyside withdrew after 2 rounds, while Manukau withdrew after 11 rounds.\nOther club matches.\nBenefit match for Albert Asher.\nA match was played on 27 September between Maritime (though the team included members of the Marist side including Neville St George, and City Rovers with the proceeds going to the benefit of Mr. Opai Asher, a league veteran who was incapacitated as the result of an accident. A match was also played between the \"Auckland Star\" and \"The New Zealand Herald\". It was won 23 points to 5 by the Star.\nSt Johns benefit match.\nTo end the season a rugby union and rugby league match was played at the Auckland Domain for the benefit of the St. John Ambulance Brigade, whose members regularly attend league and union matches to perform first aid to injured players. The rugby league match was between City and Ponsonby, and was won by City 13–10. Ben Davidson made his debut for City Rovers and scored 2 tries in what was to be a prolific try scoring career for City and later Wigan. It is likely that the Cooke who kicked a goal for Ponsonby was Bert Cooke, the famous All Black of the future. He had played junior rugby league for the Telegraph Messengers in 1917 and 1918 before they amalgamated with Maritime in 1919. The club had been affiliated with Ponsonby prior to this. He switched to rugby union the following year.\nMaritime team tour.\nIn Mid October the Maritime senior team embarked on an end of season tour to Hawkes Bay. They played Petane and Ahuriri and had two comfortable victories. Ahuriri had won the Vigor Brown Shield and the Charity Cup and the match was reportedly played in front of a large crowd. After their return they travelled to Thames on 18 October to play in a series of exhibition matches along with the Richmond club though the results are unknown.\nRepresentative fixtures.\nOn 14 May the selectors conducted a trial match between Auckland A and B teams to help choose both an Auckland and New Zealand team. The B team won the match by 15 points to 14. The first representative fixture of the season was a match played against the New Zealand team which was preparing to depart for their tour of Australia. The New Zealand team won 25–19 at the Auckland Domain in front of 8,000. On Friday, 19 July Auckland played a match at the Auckland Domain with a Returned Soldiers team as part of a “Peace Day” sports celebration involving sports from several different codes. Although the Peace Day celebrations ran over 3 days.\nOn 23 August Auckland played against a team composed of available members of the New Zealand team which had toured Australia earlier in the year. The Auckland team was composed of Auckland players who remained so in essence was largely a ‘B’ team. The match was played at Victoria Park and resulted in a high scoring win to the ‘NZ’ team 45–30.\nThen on 20 September, Auckland played against the touring Australian side and were well defeated by 32 points to 8. The match was played at the Auckland Domain in front of 18,000 spectators.\nAuckland v New Zealand touring team.\nNew Zealand was playing a test match against the touring Australian side so as a way to select a team for Auckland for their upcoming match against Australia the selectors decided to play a match between New Zealand players who had toured Australia recently but weren't selected for the test side, and remaining Auckland players.\nAuckland v Australia.\nThe Auckland team was coached by Harold Rowe who had played 44 matches for New Zealand from 1907 to 1909 and 33 games for Leeds in the 1909/10 season. They went away for a weeks training prior to meeting the Australian side however it made little difference as they were well beaten."

It was the first BDO World Darts Championship not held at the Lakeside Country Club since 1985. Gabriel Pascaru and Thibault Tricole became the first players from Romania and France respectively to play in a World Darts Championship. Three-time men's defending champion Glen Durrant was absent from the event, having switched to the Professional Darts Corporation in January 2019. The reigning women's champion was Mikuru Suzuki. She successfully retained her title, by defeating Lisa Ashton 3–0 in the final. Wayne Warren won his first world title with a 7–4 win over fellow Welshman Jim Williams in the final. He became the oldest player ever to win a world title.\nIt was the final World Darts Championship organised by the BDO due to the collapse of the organisation in September 2020. Following the tournament, the World Darts Federation announced plans to launch the WDF World Championship in 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic these plans were pushed back to 2022.\nPrize money.\nOn 30 December 2019, less than a week before the tournament was due to start, it was announced that due to ticket sales of only 15%, the prize money would be 'reduced somewhat'. A reduction from £359,000 to £150,000 was reported in the media but prize money aside from the winners was unconfirmed. It was thought that the prize money would be reduced by half in most cases, although this was unconfirmed. On 15 January 2020, the prize fund was finally revealed with the men's champion portion dropping from £100,000 last year to only £23,000 this year. On 11 February 2020, it was reported that players had still not received any prize money, despite payment being due by 9 February, 28 days after the tournament ended.\nMen's\nWomen's\nMen's.\nFormat and qualifiers.\n1–16 in BDO rankings\"Seeded in First round\"\n17–24 in BDO rankings\"First round\"\n25–27 in BDO rankings\"Preliminary round\"\nWorld Master\"Preliminary round\"\nRegional Table qualifiers\"Preliminary round\"\nPlayoff qualifiers\"Preliminary round\"\nDraw bracket.\nPreliminary round.\nAll matches are the first to 3 sets\nWomen's.\nFormat and qualifiers.\n1–8 in BDO rankings\"Seeded in first round\"\n9–16 in BDO rankings\"First round\"\nPlayoff qualifiers"

        "title": "1918 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1918 Auckland Rugby League season was its 10th since its inception in 1909. It was again severely affected by the ongoing war with several hundred players serving overseas and 44 killed who were named in the annual report. North Shore Albions withdrew from the competition early in the season and on other occasions teams played short-handed. There was also a truncated representative program with only a trial match and one full Auckland representative match versus Canterbury, which was played at the Auckland Domain in front of 10,000 spectators.\nThe senior grade featured six teams. Ponsonby United won their second consecutive title with an 8-win–1-loss record. Ponsonby then travelled to Christchurch to play Sydenham for the Thacker Shield and they won 11 points to 0. City Rovers won their second Roope Rooster title with a 6–3 win over Maritime following their first win in 1916.\nSenior games still regularly attracted strong crowds. The round 4 matches at Victoria Park drew an estimated crowd of 6,000. While 4,000 attended the round 5 matches, 5,000 the round 7 clash between City Rovers and Grafton Athletic at the same venue, and 6,000 witnessed the round 9 match between City Rovers and Ponsonby United.\nAt the season end many one-off matches were played between various teams. One of the more notable ones was a match between the \"Auckland Star\" staff and \"The New Zealand Herald\" staff. The game was won by the Auckland Star by 8 points to 4. These company type fixtures were to become a regular feature of Auckland Rugby League for decades to come.\n \n \nNews.\nEpidemic deaths.\nAt the conclusion of the year the Auckland Rugby League took out an advertisement acknowleding the deaths of people associated with the game from the recent influenza epidemic. They included Matthew Winter Maddison of the Ponsonby club, and Montrose (Monty) Stanaway who had represented Auckland in 1915 while with the Otahuhu club before later transferring to City in 1917. And also H. Iles, Arthur Winnall, B Evans, P. Sheenan, and Francis Caulam also being mentioned along with \"all others who have lost their loved ones\".\nParnell Club.\nAlthough the Parnell club did not officially form until 1921 they were belatedly registered in 1918 and fielded two teams. They had a side in the 4th grade, and another in the 6th grade. Prior to the start of the season they asked the Auckland Rugby League if they could affiliate with Grafton. It was decided to leave the arrangement to the Grafton club.\nThe reason they had asked to affiliate was that they had been late to register as a club. They then tried to affiliate with Newton Rangers. The Auckland Star in reporting on the matter wrote the “Parnell Club requested permission to affiliate with Newton. Owing to nominations being closed, thus barring Parnell from entering teams, the Northcote Club offered to forego their nominations in the 4th and 6th grade, so as to allow the Parnell Club to participate in the competitions. Affiliation was then granted to the Parnell Club, and the offer of Northcote for the transference of nominations was referred to the Junior Advisory Board”. The New Zealand Herald said that the league granted affiliation with the Newton club.\nCompetition news.\nMaritime, Mangere, and Big Store football clubs form.\nThe 'Maritime Football Club' applied to join the Auckland Rugby League with the nomination of a senior team. This was accepted by the league. They finished the season with a 1 win, 7 loss record.\nThe Māngere club applied for affiliation and the registration of 23 players at the Auckland Rugby League meeting on 17 April. This was granted by the league. They were to play in maroon and gold originally as requested but before the season started asked to wear blue instead.\nThe Big Store Football Club nominated a team to play in the league which was accepted and their colours of blue and white were approved.\nNew league rooms.\nAt the conclusion of the season the league opened their own league rooms on Swanson Street. The rooms were used for the first time with the Auckland Rugby League executive meeting on 23 October. The rooms consisted of \"a large billiard room and League office, and a room for clubs to hold their weekly meetings in\". It was stated that players did not formerly meet \"their fellow players during the summer time, but with this club now on a sound footing they will be able to meet each other and spend enjoyable evenings which should bring about a better feeling between the different teams\".\nDeath of George Cook in World War 1.\nOn January 14, 1918 George Cook died in France during World War 1. Originally he was a rugby player who played for many seasons for Horowhenua before moving to Wellington where he played representative rugby there too. He switched to rugby league in 1912 playing for Wellington and there gaining selection for New Zealand to play New South Wales. Cook moved to Auckland in 1913 and joined the Newton Rangers. He played in 9 matches for them and scored 33 points making him the second highest scorer. He was selected for Auckland and played in 6 matches scoring 4 tries. In 1914 he joined the Otahuhu Rovers club where he played 9 games and scored 29 points which was the 3rd most in the competition. Cook enlisted in the New Zealand Māori (Pioneer) Battalion in 1917. Cook died on October 12, 1918, from broncho-pneumonia while at the No. 7 Canadian General Hospital in the field in France. He was buried at Étaples Military Cemetery in Étaples, near Boulogne in north-west France.\nRepresentative match.\nAuckland played a representative match for the first time in a few seasons. They had taken a hiatus during the war years but they played a trial match between and A and B team before a match with Canterbury at the Auckland Domain. The match attracted an enormous crowd of 10,000 and Auckland won easily by 45 points to 9.\nFirst grade championship.\nThe 1st grade championship had been competing for the Myers Cup from 1910 to 1914 but after the beginning of the war the league decided to not award trophies though the grade competitions were still competed for as normal. The season began with 3 preliminary rounds before the competitions began proper on 18 May. Around 5,000 spectators attended the first round matches at Victoria Park and Devonport Domain. North Shore Albions played the preliminary rounds, round 1, and defaulted their next two matches before withdrawing from the competition.\nTeams.\nThe competition featured 6 teams.\nPreliminary rounds.\nRound 1.\n Ernie Herring debuted for Grafton as did Charles Gregpry. Former All Black, Dougie McGregor kicked 2 penalties for Grafton in their 27-4 loss to City. His brother Eric scored twice for Ponsonby in their 16-6 win over Ponsonby. For Newton, Wally Somers and George Iles both scored in a 23-9 win over Maritime.\nRound 2.\nNorth Shore was struggling to field a team owing to the impact of the war on their playing numbers. They only managed 11 players for their match with Maritime who were also fielding a weakened forward pack.\nRound 3.\nNorth Shore defaulted their match with Grafton. Ponsonby achieved a milestone of sorts becoming the first club to reach 1,000 first grade points during their match with Newton. They began the game with 983 points all time and progressed to 1,004 by the end of the match. It had taken them 72 matches to reach the mark.\nFirst Grade standings.\nPonsonby and Maritime both had default wins over North Shore Albions. Newton had a default win over Maritime (R9). These results are included in the standings.\nFirst Grade results.\nRound 2.\nNorth Shore lost by default to Maritime. In the City v Grafton match the City player Mitchell was ordered off by referee Vause for disputing a decision. He wrote a letter of apology during the week and the league ordered him to appear on Saturday to receive a “severe citation” \nRound 3.\nNorth Shore once again defaulted and the withdrew from the first grade competition leaving 5 teams.\nRound 5.\nSheehan was ordered off for Maritime in their match with Ponsonby for striking Matthews.\nRound 7.\nRemarkably the match between Newton and Ponsonby at the Domain was recorded with footage of the game surviving and being archived on The New Zealand Archive of Film, Television and Sound Ngā Taonga website. \nRound 10.\nOn 21 September a match was played between the Auckland Rugby League referees and officials of the league. The referees won by 14 points to 4 with it being refereed by Jim Rukutai.\nRoope Rooster knockout competition.\nRound 1.\nMany years later when reminiscing about his career Ernie Asher while watching a game at Carlaw Park was heard to say \"my biggest thrill ever in football was back in 1915 or 16... Ponsonby were 100 to 1 on favourite to beat us. I was playing at the Domain and I was on the sideline with a crook shoulder. One bloke got knocked out and I had to go on and we beat Ponsonby with my kicking. Yes, that was my biggest thrill in football\". He was most likely referring to this rounds match between City and Ponsonby which was in fact played in 1918 as it was one of their only meetings in this era on the Domain and where Asher kicked goals in a City win. Asher had only played in their 11 May, and 1 June matches due to his injury and it was his last ever match for City.\nTop try scorers and point scorers.\nThe following point scoring lists include both Senior Championship matches (including preliminary rounds) and the Roope Rooster competition. For the 5th time in 6 seasons Karl Ifwersen topped the point scoring lists with 66 points. This gave him 287 points from 6 seasons. While Eric McGregor (brother of Kiwi Dougie McGregor) of Ponsonby United topped the try scoring list with 10. Newton Rangers had 4 tries and 2 conversions unattributed while Ponsonby had 1 try unattributed which make the point lists for those teams slightly incomplete.\nThacker Shield.\nPonsonby United travelled south to Christchurch to play a match with Sydenham for the Thacker Shield. They were victorious and brought the shield to Auckland.\nLower grade clubs.\nThe lower grades featured teams in the 2nd grade (5), 3rd grade (5), 4th grade (9), 5th grade (11), and 6th grade (4).\nA team named \"Big Store\" was entered in the 5th grade competition. They were essentially a company team representing George Court &amp; Sons. Their motto at the time was \"Big Store\" in reference to its range of goods in their Karangahape Road store. During the season they asked the Auckland Rugby League if they could be affiliated to the Newton Rangers club. The league delayed a decision as they had earlier asked to be affiliated to the City Rovers club before changing their mind. The affiliation with Newton was later affirmed. The team was however thrown out of the competition after an incident in a match in early August. They were suspended until the end of the following (1919 season), and their captain, Crawley was suspended for 3 seasons.\nSecond grade.\nŌtāhuhu Rovers won the championship. While fixtures were reported in the newspapers each week there were only 2 scores reported in the entire season along with 1 other result (City defeating Māngere Rangers in round 1). This renders the standings below to be extremely inaccurate. Grafton withdrew after round 1 and have not been included in the standings as it is unlikely they fielded a side, while Ponsonby withdrew after round 7.\nThird grade.\nNorth Shore won the championship. There were only 11 scores reported from 26 scheduled matches.\nFourth grade.\nTelegraph Messengers won the championship, sealing it on September 7 with a 15-2 win over Newton. Parnell, Manukau, and Otahuhu all withdrew from the competition after round 9. Ponsonby withdrew 1 round later. There were 23 scores reported and 23 unreported.\nFifth grade.\nOtahuhu won the championship after defeating City in the final on September 14. There were many results not reported however the Otahuhu standings and for and against record are correct as they are displayed on their championship winning photograph in their present day club rooms. Telegraph Messengers, Manukau B, and Ponsonby B all withdrew after 11 rounds, while Manukau A and Northcote &amp; Birkenhead Ramblers withdrew a week later. Big Store was removed from the competition by the ARL due to a disciplinary issue in an August match. They were suspended until the end of 1919 but failed to ever take part in Auckland Rugby League again. 23 scores were reported, with 34 scores not reported.\nSixth grade.\nCity won the championship. There were 23 results reported and 23 not reported.\nExhibition matches.\nRichmond and the Telegraph Messengers 4th grade teams travelled to Thames to play an exhibition match on 12 October. Telegraph Messengers had been winners of the championship with Richmond the runners up.\nRepresentative fixtures.\nOn 7 September a trial match was held between two teams picked by the selectors at Victoria Park in order to select the Auckland representative team. The A team was Minogue, Bill Walsh, Thomas McClymont, Jim Clark (Ponsonby), Dougie McGregor, Karl Ifwersen, Bailey, Ernie Herring (Grafton), George Iles (Newton), George Davidson (Maritime), Jim Rukutai, Tom Haddon, Francis (City, while the B Team was George Paki, Ivan Stewart (City), Eric McGregor, A Maddison, Cadman (Ponsonby), A Thomas, Jack Keenan, Bill Williams (Newton), Pullen, H Simpson (Grafton), Bert Avery, A Cross, Sheehan (Maritime), with W Hanlin (Ponsonby), Stallworthy (Maritime), Clarke (City), and Jack Keenan (Newton) named in the reserves. The following weekend Auckland played Canterbury at the Auckland Domain and were victorious by 45 points to 9.\nAuckland v Canterbury.\nThe match saw 10,000 spectators attend and took in 300 pounds in gate takings.\nAuckland representative matches played and scorers.\nErnie Bailey had begun the season with North Shore but after they withdrew their senior team from the competition he transferred to the Grafton Athletic team."

        "text": "Brandon Knight (born April 1, 1997) is a former American football offensive tackle in the National Football League (NFL). He was signed by the Dallas Cowboys as an undrafted free agent in 2019. He played college football at Indiana.\nEarly years.\nKnight attended Noblesville High School in Noblesville, Indiana. He was a two-time All-conference selection. As a senior, he received Associated Press Class 6A All-state honors. He originally committed to Purdue University to play college football, but changed his commitment to Indiana University.\nCollege career.\nAs a freshman, he appeared in 11 games, playing as an offensive tackle or tight end. He had his lone reception, a 22-yard touchdown, in the 54–36 win against Purdue University, which sealed a bowl berth. He was named honorable-mention BTN.com All-Freshman.\nAs a sophomore, he appeared in the first 8 games, starting six at right tackle after fifth-year senior Dimitric Camiel had back surgery. He suffered a season-ending left leg injury against the University of Maryland.\nAs a junior, an unspecified injury kept him out of the early season games, but was able to return to play in the final 10 contests with 8 starts at right tackle.\nAs a senior, he started all 12 games at right tackle, allowing three sacks in 904 snaps. He received honorable-mention All-Big Ten honors at the end of the season. He finished with 41 career and 26 starts at right tackle.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nKnight signed with the Dallas Cowboys as an undrafted free agent following the 2019 NFL Draft on May 10. He appeared in 7 games in 2019, with one start. He started at right tackle against the New York Jets, as an injury replacement for La'el Collins.\nIn 2020, reserve swing tackle Cameron Fleming was not re-signed, opening the door for Knight to become the backup at left tackle.

        "text": "In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five–for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings.

        "text": "Alden Rowing manufactures sliding-seat rowing boats. Their original product, the Alden Ocean Shell, was designed in (sources differ) 1970 or 1971. Traditional shell designs use high aspect ratio hulls, with long waterline with minimum beam, that emphasize racing performance at the cost of stability. These types of boats are only usable on flat water. Alden, however, specializes in shorter, beamier, highly stable designs which are suitable for rowing in open water, where swells are commonly encountered. As of 2004, Alden had sold 25,000 shells.\nHistory.\nThe original Alden Ocean Shell was designed by Arthur E. Martin, a naval architect, trained at Webb Institute. Martin had begun experimenting with fiberglass as a boatbuilding material in the 1960s. His first design, a kayak, was developed in 1966. Over the next few years, he added a sliding seat and a deck to shed water; this evolved into the Alden Ocean Shell by 1970. Martin Marine was formed in 1971, located in Cohasset, Massachusetts. In 1972, the company moved to Kittery, Maine. Arthur Martin died in 1992, after which the company moved through several ownerships. As of 2006, it was headquartered in Rowley, Massachusetts, under the name Alden Rowing Shells.\nIn the first year of production, 165 were sold. Martin also developed the drop-in rowing mechanism which came to be called the Oarmaster, which has since evolved over a series of design iterations. This was a metal frame containing the sliding seat, foot stretcher, outriggers, and oarlocks. The frame could be installed in many different boat designs. It isolated all the high stress loadpaths to the metal frame, eliminating point-loads on the boat's hull. The original 16-foot model was sold with spruce and mahogany oars produced by East/West Custom Boats, in Eliot, Maine.\nAs of 2019, Alden Rowing produces a variety of 1x (single scull) and 2x (double scull) boats, ranging from 16 to 29 feet, all using the drop-in rowing unit concept.\nRace.\nThe Alden Ocean Shell Association was originally formed as a membership organization for people who owned Alden boats. The organization sponsors a race from Fort Foster to the Isles of Shoals, crossing of open ocean off the coast of Maine. In 2006, they reorganized into the International Recreational Open Water Association (IROW), and dropped the requirement for members to own Alden boats.\nThe Mariners' Museum and Park has an Alden 16 in their collection. They describe the boat as having \"a flat bottom for stability and a flaring bow for lift and dryness, all very different from the traditional narrow, round-bottomed, straight-sided shell\"."

The team was coached by future Basketball Hall of Famer Joseph Brennan, who was in his first year at the helm of the St. Francis Terriers. The team was not part of a conference and played as division I independents. The Terriers played their home games at the Bulter Street Gymnasium in their Cobble Hill, Brooklyn campus.\nThe 1941–41 team finished with a .889 record at 16–2.\nPreseason.\nPrior to the season starting former head coach Rody Cooney resigned. He recommended Joseph Brennan or Bob Griebe for the position. Both Joseph and Bob were former Brooklyn Visitations players. Then athletics director Brother Richard O.S.F. hired Joseph and Bob, with Joseph the head coach of the varsity team and Bob of the freshman team.\nRegular season.\nSt. Francis won its first nine games and in that span was the highest scoring team in the New York Metropolitan area, averaging 60 points per game. Against La Salle, Jim Agoglia came close to setting an individual scoring record at Madison Square Garden by scoring 20 points. The La Salle game was at Madison Square Garden and the Explorers were the favorites to win, but the Terriers won 50–34.\nTheir first loss of the season came against N.Y.U. at Madison Square Garden. The Terriers riding a 9-game win streak were the favorites to win but they lost a close game 37–40. The Terriers were leading 23–14 at the half.\nComing off their first loss of the season the Terriers defeated Saint Peter's, and set a record in the Metropolitan area for their 85–29 victory.\nThe Terriers then beat Brooklyn College and Manhattan College and were in the running for a National Invitation Tournament spot. The Terriers then lost to CCNY and were out of the running. After the CCNY loss, the Terriers defeated Hofstra and upset St. John's to finish the season at 16–2. Brooklyn sports writers were of the opinion that St. Francis should still qualify for the NIT considering the 16-2 record.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#0038A8; border: 2px solid #CE1126;;color:#FFFFFF;\"| Regular Season"

        "text": "The Chiefs Esports Club, often shortened to The Chiefs, is a professional esports club who is or has fielded teams in \"League of Legends\", \"Valorant\", \"Halo Infinite\" and \"Rocket League\". The team is based in Australia and is one of the most well known esports clubs in Oceania. The Chiefs' \"League of Legends\" team competed in the LCO, Oceania's top-level league for the game, but left in 2023 upon The Chiefs being acquired by fellow Australian organization Team Bliss Esports, who also fielded an LCO team.\n\"League of Legends\".\nHistory.\nIn August 2014, the roster of Team Immunity left their organisation and formed Exodus Gaming, later rebranded as the Chiefs Esports Club. Their initial roster consisted of top laner Brandon \"Swip3rR\" Holland, jungler Samuel \"Spookz\" Broadley, mid laner Simon \"Swiffer\" Papamarkos, bot laner Derek \"Raydere\" Trang, and support Andrew \"Rosey\" Rose, and that five-man lineup became the longest-standing active roster without any substitutions or changes in history, unbroken for 608 days. In May 2015, that streak was broken when Rosey left the team to join Sin Gaming and was replaced by EGym. Despite their roster change, the Chiefs' lineup remained at the top of their region for the duration of the 2015 season, with OPL victories all four periods of the OPL; i.e. Split 1, Split 1 playoffs, Split 2, and Split 2 playoffs. Internationally, they fared less well, placing fifth at the International Wildcard Invitational in April and second at the International Wildcard Qualifier for Worlds 2015.\nIn 2016, the Chiefs placed second for the first time domestically in the first OPL split, but still upset first place Legacy Esports in the playoffs, to return to the IWCI once again. They then qualified for IEM Challenger for IEM Season 11 - Oakland—their first competition against teams from major regions—but lost 0–2 against Longzhu Gaming despite standout performances from Swiffer on Orianna.\nThe Chiefs placed third in the OPL 2017 Split 1 regular season and fourth in playoffs after losing 2–3 to Sin Gaming in the second round. In the OPL 2017 Split 2 regular season, the Chiefs once again placed third in the regular season, but managed to advance all the way to the finals in playoffs, where they lost 1–3 to the Dire Wolves.\nFor all four iterations of the 2018 OPL season (i.e. Split 1 and 2 regular seasons and playoffs), the Chiefs placed second, losing to Dire Wolves in both finals. The Chiefs placed second again in the OPL 2019 Split 1 regular season, but lost 3–0 to ORDER in the third round of playoffs and failed to make it to the finals. The 2019 OPL split 2 saw the Chiefs come first in the regular season, and coming second in playoffs, losing to Mammoth in the finals of the split 3–0.\nThe Chiefs came second in the regular season of the 2020 OPL Split 1, and lost 2–3 to Dire Wolves in the playoffs, finishing third overall. After finishing fourth in the regular season of the 2020 OPL Split 2, the team went on to finish third once again in playoffs, losing to ORDER 1–3.\nThe Chiefs were selected as one of the eight teams of the LCO following the dissolution of the OPL. Much of the team's 2020 roster left during the 2021 preseason, with only support Dragku remaining.\nThe Chiefs would win the LCO Split 2 title in 2022, qualifying for 2022 Worlds, where they went winless and finished last in their play-in group. Upon the LCO's incorporation into the Pacific Championship Series in 2023, The Chiefs would win both LCO splits that year, qualifying them for PCS playoffs both times. On both instances, they would only win one game overall and finish tied for last place with the LCO's Team Bliss Esports.\nUpon Team Bliss acquiring The Chiefs, the spot occupied by the latter had to be sold, since no one owning group could own two teams within the LCO. On 3 November 2023, their spot was successfully sold to FURY Global.\n\"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive\".\nThe Chiefs Esports Club first entered the professional \"CS:GO\" scene with its acquisition of the Qlimax Crew in 2015.\nThe Chiefs disbanded its \"CS:GO\" division in late 2021."

        "title": "Cricket at the 2022 Commonwealth Games",
        "text": "A cricket tournament was held at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, England, during July and August 2022. It was cricket's first inclusion in the Commonwealth Games since a List A men's tournament was held at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The matches were played as Women's Twenty20 Internationals (WT20Is), with only a women's tournament being part of the Games.\nAustralia became the first team to qualify for the semi-finals, after winning their first two matches in Group A. New Zealand's win over Sri Lanka in the second round of matches ensured their own and England's progression to the semi-finals. India completed the semi-final line-up, beating Barbados in their final group match. India won the first semi-final, beating England by 4 runs. Australia won the second semi-final, beating New Zealand by 5 wickets.\nNew Zealand claimed the bronze medal after beating England by 8 wickets in the Bronze Medal Match. Australia claimed the gold medal, with India taking silver, after winning the Gold Medal Match by 9 runs. Australian batter Beth Mooney was the leading run-scorer in the tournament, with 179 runs, whilst India's Renuka Singh was the leading wicket-taker, with 11 wickets.\nSchedule.\nThe competition schedule for the cricket tournament was as follows:\nIn April 2021 the International Cricket Council (ICC) announced that all matches at the tournament would hold Twenty20 International status. The dates of the tournament were confirmed in June 2021.\nBackground.\nThe Commonwealth Games 2022 was held in Birmingham, England, from 28 July to 9 August and had over 5,000 athletes representing 72 Commonwealth Games Associations taking part. Under Commonwealth Games rules, all core Commonwealth sports must be hosted but additional sports may be added by the local organising committee. In November 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) made a joint bid for a women's Twenty20 tournament to be included. In August 2019, the Commonwealth Games Federation announced that the bid had been successful after a vote of all 72 Commonwealth Games Associations with women's cricket being added to the 2022 programme along with beach volleyball and para table tennis. The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), as custodian of the Laws of Cricket, welcomed the move and hoped it would eventually lead to cricket's inclusion in the 2028 Summer Olympics.\nVenues.\nThe tournament was played in Twenty20 format with eight teams qualifying. Edgbaston Cricket Ground in Birmingham was the venue for the matches. Though there were suggestions for matches to also be held at the County Cricket Ground, Derby; New Road, Worcester; and Grace Road, Leicester, none of these were selected in the final confirmation.\nQualification.\nIn November 2020, the ICC announced the qualification process for the 2022 Commonwealth Games tournament. England automatically qualified as the hosts, along with the six highest ranked sides as of 1 April 2021 as direct qualifiers. One further place was awarded to the winners of the 2022 Commonwealth Games Cricket Qualifier.\nThe allocation of the six direct qualifiers via the ICC Women's T20I rankings was dependent on the representation of at least four out of the six Commonwealth Games Federation regions (Africa, Americas, Asia, Caribbean, Europe and Oceania). If at least four regions were not represented from those in the top seven, then teams ranked eighth to tenth were the first to be considered to meet the criteria, before filling the remaining allocations from the rankings. Each team can enter a squad of up to 15 athletes.\nAs the West Indies qualified as a direct qualifier, the results of a separate tournament were originally going to be used to determine which Commonwealth Games Association (CGA) earned qualification. The tournament was scheduled to be contested between Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and two composite teams representing the Leeward Islands and Windward Islands. However, in August 2021, Cricket West Indies (CWI) confirmed that the regional qualifier had been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, Barbados were selected to represent the West Indies, by virtue of being the Twenty20 Blaze defending champions. The Commonwealth Games Qualifier, to determine the final team, took place in Malaysia in January 2022. Sri Lanka won the qualifier, beating Bangladesh by 22 runs in the final match of the tournament, to secure their place at the Commonwealth Games.\nSquads.\nThe following squads were named for the tournament.\nPrior to the Games, Lauren Down and Jess Kerr were both ruled out of New Zealand's squad with Lea Tahuhu and Claudia Green named as their replacements. India also named Simran Bahadur, Richa Ghosh and Poonam Yadav as standby players in their squad. Marizanne Kapp was ruled out of South Africa's squad due to family reasons. Trisha Chetty and Tumi Sekhukhune were also ruled out of South Africa's squad due to injuries. As a result, Delmi Tucker and Tazmin Brits were both added to their squad. England's captain Heather Knight was ruled out of their first match due to a hip injury, with Nat Sciver named as the team captain in her place.\nGroup stage.\nThe schedule for the tournament was announced in June 2021, with the full list of fixtures being confirmed in November 2021. The ICC confirmed that all matches, including those involving Barbados (whose players would usually represent the West Indies), will be designated as Twenty20 Internationals.\nGroup A.\n&lt;section begin=AStandings/&gt;\n&lt;section end=AStandings/&gt;\n Advanced to the semi-finals\n&lt;section begin=A1/&gt;&lt;section end=A1/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A2/&gt;&lt;section end=A2/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A3/&gt;&lt;section end=A3/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A4/&gt;&lt;section end=A4/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A5/&gt;&lt;section end=A5/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A6/&gt;&lt;section end=A6/&gt;\nGroup B.\n&lt;section begin=BStandings/&gt;\n&lt;section end=BStandings/&gt;\n Advanced to the semi-finals\n&lt;section begin=B1/&gt;&lt;section end=B1/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B2/&gt;&lt;section end=B2/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B3/&gt;&lt;section end=B3/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B4/&gt;&lt;section end=B4/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B5/&gt;&lt;section end=B5/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B6/&gt;&lt;section end=B6/&gt;\nMedal round.\nSemi-finals.\nThe schedule and timings of the semi-finals were confirmed on 5 August 2022.\n&lt;section begin=C1/&gt;&lt;section end=C1/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C2/&gt;&lt;section end=C2/&gt;\nBronze medal match.\n&lt;section begin=D1/&gt;&lt;section end=D1/&gt;\nGold medal match.\n&lt;section begin=D2/&gt;&lt;section end=D2/&gt;\nFinal standings.\nThe final standings were as follows:"

        "title": "1915 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1915 season, and 7th of Auckland Rugby League saw the First Grade competition begin on 8 May featuring the same 6 senior clubs who had competed in 1914.\nThe First World War was in full effect by the time the 1915 season began. War had been declared just as the 1914 rugby league season was concluding in August 1914. As a result, several efforts were made during the 1915 season by the Auckland Rugby League to raise funds for Auckland Hospital Ship and Wounded Soldiers Relief Fund.\nOn 12 June, a seven-a-side tournament was arranged to be played at Victoria Park to raise money for the Auckland Hospital Ship and Wounded Relief Fund. In total £200 was raised with \"almost 1,000 people\" in attendance. All senior clubs entered teams and the final was played between North Shore Albions and City Rovers though the match was not completed owing to the fact that some earlier matches went to extra-time and the final saw an injury requiring a stoppage. As it had become dark it was decided to call the game off with North Shore leading by 3pts. A further £35 was raised from the 19 June round of matches at Victoria Park for the same cause.\nGrafton Athletic were crowned First Grade champions for the first time after defeating City Rovers 10–5 in the championship final at Victoria Park in front of 4,000 spectators.\nNews.\nMāngere Rangers.\nOn April 14 the Māngere Rangers rugby league club was registered. They later were renamed to Māngere United. They were a junior club made up predominantly of Māori players and they fielded one team in the 1915 season in the Second grade. They finished in the top half of the standings behind City Rovers and Remuera. Their secretary for their first season was A. Te Meti. They only lasted 'one season' and a letter was written to the league in June, 1916 informing them that the club had ceased to exist and all players from their second grade side were free to play for other sides. However in 1918 they again entered a side in the second grade. Then in 1919 they were being coached by Jim Rukutai. The club continued to exist until 1934. Many of their players then became involved in the Manukau club and their children and grand children were associated with them for decades afterwards.\nThames Old Boys.\nAt the start of the season a Thames Old Boys club was formed made up of players who had previously lived in or had a connection with the Thames area. They fielded teams in the Second and Third grades. The club only existed from 1915 to 1920. They went on annual playing excursions to the Thames area in three of their six seasons.\nThe beginning of the Roope Rooster.\nA trophy which is still played for today saw its beginnings in the 1915 season. Namely the Roope Rooster trophy which was donated by Mr. Pauntley Whittington (Dick) Roope. It was a knockout competition with one round of matches before semi-finals were played. Roope had retired from playing (for Ponsonby) and was the Auckland Rugby League chairman to start the season. However he resigned his position in order to be able to resume playing for the young Grafton Athletic club. With the semi-final between Newton and Grafton being drawn (after North Shore received the bye) the management committee decided rather than replaying a match between the same teams there would be more interest in a match between Grafton and North Shore, with Newton progressing to the final. The second semi-final was played at Victoria Park and saw both teams wearing white armbands in memory of 3 men killed in action at the Dardanelles who had played club rugby league in Auckland (Charles Savory from Ponsonby United, Charles James Hally from Otahuhu, and William Moeki from City Rovers). A charge was made for the semi-final between North Shore and Grafton with the proceeds going to the Door of Hope, the Salvation Army Maternity and Rescue Homes, Sister Esther's Relief Work, and the St John Ambulance Brigade. The final was played on 11 September at Victoria Park between North Shore Albions and Newton Rangers, with North Shore winning 10 points to 7.\nPatriotic Carnival Match.\nOn July 3 a Patriotic Carnival was held at the Auckland Domain with various sports and events played. Some junior league matches took place along with an exhibition game between Grafton and City which was won by Grafton 15 to 10. For Grafton, Dick Roope, of Roope Rooster fame scored two of their tries. For City George Asher, younger brother of Albert and Ernie scored a try while their other try was scored by William Mincham. Mincham later became a test referee and his son Ted, and grandson Robert both played for New Zealand.\n \n \n1st Grade championship (Myers Cup).\nThe 1st grade championship had been competing for the Myers Cup from 1910 to 1914 but after the beginning of the war the league decided to not award trophies though the grade competitions were still competed for as normal. Twenty eight matches were played in the 1st grade competition. Nine full rounds were played followed by the final. Victoria Park was the main ground used, with matches also played at the Auckland Domain, Devonport Domain, and Otahuhu.\n1st Grade fixtures.\nRound 1.\n Bill Davidson debuted for City aged just 18. He kicked a goal but did not play again for them until the following season. He would represent New Zealand 4 years later in 1919. Graham Walker Cook debuted for Ponsonby in the forwards. He enlisted in the war effort and died his wounds in France on July 11, 1916 aged 22. Bernard Farrelly debuted in the halves for Otahuhu. He departed New Zealand in July 1917 for the war effort and was killed in action on August 30, 1918 in France. He is buried at Bancourt British Cemetery, Pas-de-Calais, France. \nRound 2.\nFrederick Louis Trezise debuted for City. Several weeks later the league denied his registration due to some discipline issue stemming from his time in rugby. He had been sent off when playing for the City rugby club in a match against Marist in June of 1914 and suspended. Trezise was an Auckland representative player and played 15 matches for them from 1910-13, and again later in 1923. He also played rugby for New Zealand Māori on their 1922 tour of Australia. Walter Frost debuted for Otahuhu and was moved into the five eighth position. Towards the end of 1917 he joined the forces and departed for Europe. He was a prisoner of war during 1918 at the Stalag VIII-Band camp in Poland and died of disease (Peritonitis) on October 13, 1918 aged 22. He is buried at Berlin South-Western Cemetery, Berlin, Germany.\nRound 3.\nCity travelled out to Otahuhu where they lost 2-0. They were without the services of Charles Woolley, Harold (Ray) Denize, and A Brooks who had all just signed up for the war effort. It was also reported that R. Burns who had played for City last season had been wounded in battle. Sam Magee was also unavailable due to injury while Don Kenealy was away on business. George Asher, the younger brother of Albert and Ernie joined them in the backs and played a good game at inside centre. Bert Farrelly won Otahuhu the game with a penalty kicked from halfway.\nRound 4.\nIn the match between Ponsonby and Otahuhu following a penalty being awarded to Ponsonby Arthur Hardgrave threw the ball back and it struck the referee (Richard Calthorpe) on the back of the neck and he was ordered off. It was unclear if this was accidental or deliberate according to the NZ Herald reporter of the time. At the disciplinary committee Hardgrave apologised and said that he had thrown the ball away in frustration and not at anybody in particular. The league decided to leave the matter there. During the game future New Zealand international halfback, Bill Walsh left the field injured. He was replaced by a young Arthur Matthews who would also go on to represent New Zealand in 1919, the same year as Walsh. Grafton beat Newton 15-11 with Karl Ifwersen scoring 2 tries, 2 conversions, and 1 penalty before leaving the field with an injured thigh late in the game. Alan Blakey returned to the field for the first time in 2 seasons and scored one of Newton's tries. City won their second match of the season, beating North Shore 15-8 and remarkably had not conceded a try through 4 matches.\nRound 5.\nThe Asher brothers, Albert, Ernie, and George scored all 16 of City's points in their 16-10 win over Grafton. Otahuhu were missing forwards, Sharpe, and Doherty. Both had tried to enlist for the war effort but were turned down for medical reasons so had traveled to Australia to try and enlist there. Also McCallion had moved to South Africa to farm. John Fischer had not intended to play as he was suffering from influenza, while Spence had not fully recovered from injury suffered the previous week. Captain Arthur Hardgrave was also unavailable. J Maurice made a reappearance to help the stricken side but lacked fitness and struggled. Under the circumstances they did well to only lose to Newton 18-6. During North Shore's loss to Ponsonby their captain, Hec Wynyard walked off the field and stood on the sideline.\nRound 6.\nOtahuhu was significantly weakened once more with Richardson and Browne unavailable, Arthur Hardgrave out with illness and Bert Farrelly who missed the train from Otahuhu to the City and arrived only a few minutes before halftime. They put up a good showing however and only lost by a point to North Shore. Jack Stanaway returned to the field and played at fullback for the South Auckland side. For Ponsonby, Bernard Longbottom was ordered off for questioning the referee.\nRound 7.\nAll of the matches were played in poor conditions at Victoria Park. Rugby union and hockey had cancelled all of their matches but rugby league went ahead with the fields in a messy state. In the match between Newton and North Shore both Kiwi international Stan Walters, and R Rope were sent off for \"rough play\". In the Ponsonby - City game, H Manning and Harry Francis were also ordered off for rough play late in the match with both players throwing punches at each other. Manning had to be attended to with a \"badly cut face\". It was decided by the league to suspend both players for four weeks though City appealed the decision.\nChampionship final.\nGrafton won their only ever first grade championship with a 10-5 win over City. Karl Ifwersen who had been chiefly responsible for the formation of the club captained them and scored a try and kicked 2 conversions. Warner, a forward scored their other try. Somewhat ironically Dick Roope had to be carried off the field with an injured knee and therefore missed the Roope Rooster knockout competition for the trophy which he had donated to the league. He had started the year as chairman of the league but resigned his position to resume playing. There was significant controversy around the appointment of the referee for the final. The City club applied for Dick Benson to referee the match but the referee's association declined. The Grafton club then suggested that Leonard Nield should be appointed, however the Association decided on Archie Ferguson. This did not satisfy the City club however and their delegate R. Pollock said that Mr Ferguson \"had evinced bias against the City club and had publicly expressed opinions concerning one or two players\". After much too-ing and fro-ing it was decided to ask Billy Murray if he would referee but the Grafton club objected to his appointment. They then decided to appoint Leonard Nield but the referees themselves had had their tempers raised and on the Saturday and they did not want to change the original appointment. In the end the City players unanimously agreed to take the field under Archie Ferguson and so he refereed the match. After the conclusion of the match Pollock said \"we were beaten, and it was our own fault\". While the City captain, Albert Asher said \"the club has had several disagreements, but after last Saturday we shall always be pleased to see Mr. Ferguson as referee\". Playing in the final for City was forward Samuel Russell Magee. He was killed in an \"unfortunate accident on the Main Trunk line to the troop train which was taking recruits to Trentham\" on October 12, 1915.\nRoope Rooster knockout competition.\nNewton, Grafton and North Shore were round 1 victors and North Shore received a bye meaning they should have advanced to the final directly. However Grafton and Newton played out a 2–2 draw in their semi-final. Rather than play a replay the league decided to have a second semi-final match between Grafton and North Shore, with Newton progressing to the final. North Shore beat Grafton and then defeated Newton in the final to win the inaugural Roope Rooster trophy which is still played for today. P.W. (Dick) Roope was confined to bed after badly injuring his knee in the Grafton win over City in the championship final.\nRound 1.\nAt Deovonport the City side evidently did not take the new trophy seriously and began the game with 10 men and only 3 forwards. Eventually Jim Rukutai joined the game but played without boots and in a pair of long trousers. Despite this under the leadership of Albert Asher they hung in the game and threatened to make a match of it before North Shore finished them off. It was also mentioned that neither Otahuhu or Newton took their game seriously either. Otahuhu scored 3 unconverted tries to O'Connell, Fisher, and Eustace, and had 3 others disallowed for minor infractions to Spence, Simmonds, and McManus, but still lost comfortably to Newton 24-9 with R Clark scoring 15 points through 3 tries and 3 conversions. Near the end of the game O'Connell, who was playing out of position at five eighth broke his leg after he attempted to gather the ball but collided with Thomas of Newton. The match was then called off several minutes from time.\nSemi-final.\nThe death of Charles Savory was confirmed recently and there was much lamenting of his death at Gallipoli. Players wore white arm bands in his memory along with Charles Hally, William Moeki, and Miller, who had all been killed at Gallipoli. It was also reported that Edward Fox and George Seagar were on the front lines. Dougie McGregor and Mason had their tries singled out as two of the mopst outstanding ever seen at Victoria Park, McGregor scything through the North Shore backs to graze the posts to score while Mason made a strong \"cork screw run\" beating several Grafton backs to score by the posts. Mason had recently joined the side and was a Māori player who had played rugby in the South Island.\nFinal.\nHeavy rain set in before the game and the field was covered in water in many areas. North Shore won the match to claim the first ever Roope Rooster title by 10 points to 7.\nTop try scorers and point scorers.\nThe following point scoring lists include both Senior Championship matches and the Roope Rooster competition but does not include the exhibition match at the Patriotic Carnival between Grafton and City. Unlike in previous seasons where there were several matches with incomplete scoring lists the 1915 season was well reported by the New Zealand Herald and only two tries were unattributed (one for Ponsonby and one for Newton). For the second year in a row the outstanding Karl Ifwersen easily topped the point scoring lists. Ifwersen, Paul, and Ernie Asher all kicked goals from marks (when they or a team mate caught a kicked ball on the full within goal kicking range) which were worth 2 points.\nCharity Carnival.\nThen on 3 July a \"Patriotic Carnival\" was held involving the Auckland Hockey Association, Auckland Rugby League, Auckland Rugby Union, and the Auckland Football Association. In addition there was a golf competition and a school basketball competition. Over 15,000 people crammed into the Auckland Domain to watch the matches. In the league matches Grafton Athletic defeated City Rovers by 15 points to 10. For Grafton tries were scored by Bob Mitchell, Roope (2), and Tom Haddon, while for City George Asher and William Mincham scored tries with Ernie Asher kicking a conversion and penalty. In the second grade match City Rovers beat Māngere 8 points to 3, and in the fourth grade match the Manukau Rovers defeated Ponsonby United by 8 points to 3 also.\nLower grades.\nThe lower grades consisted of second, third, fourth, and for the first time a fifth grade. New teams included Thames Old Boys, made up of players from Thames who had settled in Auckland, and Richmond Rovers who were affiliated with the Eden Ramblers club but soon after became a club on their own.\nJ. Endean donated a shield to be awarded to the winner of the fourth grade competition in memory of his brother, Arthur Endean who had been killed in action at the Dardanelles. The shield would be named the Trooper Arthur Endean Shield.\nSecond grade standings.\nNorthcote withdrew after 5 rounds.\nThird grade standings.\nThe majority of the Sunnyside B team enlisted during the season and this meant they could no longer field a team. The remaining players transferred to their A side. The North Shore side also withdrew in late August for the same reason.\nFourth grade standings (Endean Shield).\nSunnyside won with a record of 11 wins, 1 draw and 1 loss, 215 points for and 36 against. The Grafton Athletic side withdrew after 3 rounds, following a loss to Manukau in round 1 and then a default loss to Sunnyside in round 2. While the Newton Rangers withdrew after 7 rounds and City Rovers a week later.\nFifth grade standings.\nRemuera withdrew after the first round, Sunnyside withdrew after round 3, while Richmond withdrew after 4 rounds. It is likely that Remuera and Sunnyside did not take the field and therefore they have been excluded from the standings. City rovers had reportedly scored 220 points and conceded 0 after their August 28 win over Otahuhu, however they had won the match 12-2, and early won a match with Newton 5-3, so the record was more likely 220-5 at this point. They then defeated Ponsonby 17-0, with their final match score not reported.\nRepresentative season.\nDue to World War I having broken out and the large number of players who had gone to fight the representative season was far reduced from previous years. The Auckland Rugby League did however decide to play 3 fixtures at the end of the season to support fledgling country leagues. Auckland had seen the death of a representative player already when Charles Savory died of his wounds at Gallipoli. The first representative match of the season was played on 28 August when Auckland defeated Thames by 27 points to 16 at Victoria Park with over 4,000 in attendance. In the return match a week later Thames won 25–13. The following weekend saw Auckland lose to Waikato in Huntly, though they had several new combinations and the first ever Roope Rooster club final was played at the same time in Auckland. A junior representative fixture was played as the curtain-raiser with Auckland winning by 16 points to 3 over a Lower Waikato team.\nRepresentative fixtures.\nAuckland v Thames.\nIn the return match 350 Auckland supporters made the journey on board the Wakatere and were entertained by the Onehunga Brass Band. Thames won with a second half comeback with the wind. Auckland captain 'Hec' Wynyard was injured about 10 minutes before halftime with a kick to his side and retired at halftime with Scotty McClymont moving from full back to centre, Rogers shifting from prop to fullback and F Tresize coming on as the substitute. The City Rovers and Thames Old Boys clubs from Auckland played in a curtain raiser.\nAuckland representative matches played and scorers.\nThe Forsyth who scored a try in the match against Lower Waikato is an unknown player. There had been no player by that name mentioned in Auckland club rugby league at all during the season."

        "text": "The ice hockey competitions of the 2022 Winter Olympics was played at two venues located in Beijing. The Beijing National Indoor Stadium, which seats 18,000, is located at Olympic Green area. The Wukesong Arena, seating 10,000, was also used, with both arenas having been constructed for the 2008 Summer Olympics.\nThe men's tournament had 12 teams competing, and the women's tournament 10 for the first time (an increase of two from 2018). Two events were contested, one each for men and women.\nMen's tournament.\nThe tournament featured twelve countries, eight qualifying through the IIHF World Ranking, the host China, and three through qualifying tournaments. The format remained the same as the previous three Olympics; three groups of four compete in three games to determine seeding, each played every other team in their group, followed by four rounds of elimination games. Each group winner received a bye into the second round, along with the highest ranked of the remaining teams. The remaining eight teams played an eliminating qualification game to advance to the quarter-final round. Each quarter-final winner advanced to the semi-finals with the winners playing for the gold medal and the losers playing for the bronze. With the cancellation of the 2020 Men's Ice Hockey World Championships, the groups were established on 24 April 2020, using the IIHF world rankings where seeding counted for the ranking points in unplayed tournaments.\nOn 10 July 2020, the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) and National Hockey League agreed to a renewed collective bargaining agreement, which includes a provision opening the possibility for the NHL to explore participation at the 2022 and 2026 Winter Olympics. On 22 July 2021, the NHL released a 2021–22 schedule that included an Olympic break, but the league also announced that a final agreement had not yet been reached regarding Olympic participation of NHL players in 2022. On 3 September 2021, an agreement was made to allow NHL players to compete.\nOn 22 December 2021, the NHL and the NHLPA announced that NHL players would not be participating in the men's ice hockey tournament at the 2022 Games. COVID-19 has forced a change in the NHL schedule. With approximately 50 games postponed, the NHL was to use the Olympic break to make up its own postponed games rather than have the players compete in the Olympics.\nQualification.\nQualification for the men's tournament at the 2022 Winter Olympics was determined by the IIHF World Ranking following the 2019 Men's Ice Hockey World Championships. The top eight joined the hosts and three qualifiers.\nParticipating nations.\nThe groups were established on 24 April 2020 in absence of a World Championship. Qualifiers one, two, and three, were the winners of the final qualification tournaments. Their designation was determined by their qualification seeding.\nDue to the lack of ice hockey talent in China, players had to be recruited from abroad. The men's hockey team had eleven Canadians, nine Chinese, three Americans, and a Russian.\nWomen's tournament.\nFor the first time ten countries competed in the women's tournament, six qualifying through the IIHF World Ranking, the host China, and three through qualifying tournaments held in November 2021. The qualification groups and schedule will be established at the 2020 IIHF Annual Congress.\nQualification.\nQualification for the women's tournament at the 2022 Winter Olympics were supposed to be determined by the IIHF World Ranking following the 2020 Women's Ice Hockey World Championships, but they were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The top six ranked nations were established by using their seeding for ranking points in unplayed tournaments in 2020.\nParticipating nations.\nQualifiers Czech Republic, Denmark, and Sweden, were the winners of the final qualification tournaments. Their designation was determined by their qualification seeding."

        "title": "China National Baseball League",
        "text": "The China National Baseball League (, CNBL) is a professional baseball league founded in 2019.\nHistory.\nThe original China Baseball League (CBL) was founded in 2002. The league suspended operations in 2012 due to financial troubles after the 2011 season, but returned in 2014. The league closed permanently in 2016. The original league was the final in 2018 season and discontinued operating league.\nOn August 16, 2019, the league announced that Major League Baseball signed an agreement with the Chinese Baseball Association to help with a revamp of the league.\non August 6, 2019 the 8th China Baseball Professional League (CNBL) Draft Conference and League Logo Release Ceremony was held in Beijing. The logo of the league was unveiled, and the 5th CNBL Draft was held, with 2019 players selected to represent four professional clubs in the new season.\nThe league is in its infancy and will play a very important role in improving the competitive level of baseball in China. The new season will feature 18 rounds, 36 games, five best-of-three finals and an All-Star Weekend, which runs from mid-August to the end of October.\nThe four clubs participating in the new season are the Beijing Tigers, Tianjin Lions, Jiangsu Juma and Guangdong Cheetah. The opener will be played between two traditional baseball teams, with the Beijing Tigers and Tianjin Lions officially kicking off at the Tianjin Tuanbo Sports Center Baseball Stadium.\nTickets for the 2019 China Baseball Professional League will be sold by each club, and fans and friends are welcome to watch the game. In addition, all league matches will be presented to fans and friends through online live broadcasts, and many online platforms will broadcast the matches of the new season live.\nThe China Baseball League was founded in 2002 by the China Baseball Association and is currently operated by Dynasty Company. At the beginning of its establishment, the Chinese Baseball League had only four teams, in 2005 the league was expanded to six teams, and in 2009 the league added another team, and the league eventually increased to seven.\nOn April 2002, 4, Shen Wei, secretary general of the Chinese Baseball Association, explained at the press conference on the inaugural of the Chinese Football League that the title of the league does not use the word \"professional\": \"The game we are launching now cannot be called a professional baseball league (Zhong Xiao), and the reason why we cannot use the word professional is because today's league does not have the conditions that professional baseball should have.\" If the level of the competition is not high enough; The conditions of the stadium are still far from the requirements of professional baseball; The ball market is not mature enough, including the stadium, baseball atmosphere, audience, fans of limited size, etc. If these conditions are not met, it is useless to claim to be professional.\" Judging by the fact that China has only a dozen adult baseball teams, the poor condition of baseball venues, and the inability to cultivate fans for several years, the Chinese baseball league is still far from the word \"professional\". The Chinese Baseball League began to receive fewer sponsorships after the Beijing Olympics. Major League Baseball and Nippon Major League Baseball, which originally planned to develop the Chinese market and invested manpower and material support, have gradually reduced the scale of cooperation or withdrawn, resulting in more difficult operations in the Chinese Baseball League and a decrease in the number of league games year by year.\nAlthough the 2011 season started smoothly with sponsors, it was forced to shorten the season due to \"force majeure\" in the middle of the season, and the original plan of each team to televise five home games was only one broadcast of the final championship game. The 2012 and 2013 Chinese Baseball League was suspended due to lack of sponsorship but resumed in 2014 after several setbacks. In 2019, the league was renamed the China Baseball Professional League from the China Baseball League and announced a new logo."

        "text": "The 1892 New South Wales Rugby Football season was the 19th season of the Sydney Rugby Premiership. This was the third competition for the Royal Agricultural Society Challenge Shield and the first competition for the Association Cricket Ground Cup. The football season lasted from May to September. The premiership was won for the sixth time by the Wallaroo Football Club, who had won their last premiership twelve years prior in 1880. Wallaroo defeated their greatest rivals, Sydney University A, in the final to win both the premiership and the Agricultural Society Challenge Shield. Sydney University A were also in the final for the Association Cricket Ground Cup, which was won by the Randwick Football Club. The Junior Badges saw Carlton win the final. Their opponents, The Pirates were defeated in the final for the third year in succession. The Second Junior Badges saw Sydney University 2nd defeat Ryde in the final. The Third Junior Badges was won by Surry, who defeated Grosvenor in the final.\nTeams.\nFor 1892 10 teams submitted entries into the Senior Badges. Many of the clubs had competed in the Senior Badges during the last season. New to the ranks were Balmain and Wentworth. Wentworth had played the Junior Badges for a number of seasons and were the current premiers. Balmain was a new club, recently formed. Both the Arfoma and Rosedale clubs decided to focus their efforts on the Junior badges.\nRule changes.\nAt the beginning of the new season, a committee of the Association Cricket Ground generously donated a trophy to be competed for by the senior clubs. How the competition was to be arranged was left up to the Union to decide. With the Agricultural Society Shield and the premiership to also be awarded, the Union attempted to incorporate all awards into one competition.\nA round robin style preliminary round was arranged with each senior team playing against each other once. At the conclusion of the regular season, the four clubs with the best records would be drawn against each other in the semi-finals for the Association Ground Cup. The next four clubs from the regular season would be drawn to play against each other in the qualifying round for the Agricultural Society Shield. For the second week, the winners of the semi-finals would proceed to the Association Ground Cup final. The winner of the final, played on the Association Cricket Ground, will win the Cup. The losers of the semi-finals will be drawn to play against the winners of the two qualifying round games. For the third week, the winners of these two games will be drawn against the Cup finalists in the Agricultural Society Shield semi-finals. The winners of the two semi's will progress to the Shield final with the winner awarded the Shield.\nAs for the Premiership, all of the games contributing to the Association Ground Cup and the Agricultural Society Shield would continue to be added to the ladder. At the conclusion of these games, the team with the best record will be awarded the premiership. With this arrangement, the Premier may not be the winner of either of the two trophies.\nAt a meeting prior to the beginning of the premiership a motion was put forward to change the name of the union from the Southern Rugby Football Union to the New South Wales Rugby Football Union. A vote was taken which saw this change made.\nSeason summary.\nThe 1892 Sydney Rugby Football Season was seen as being successful in every way. The weather was everything that could have been desired, with the exception of rain during the last few weekends. Public interest was greater than had been seen during previous seasons. Gameplay had improved with an absence of heavy scrums and an adoption of more passing and kicking, thus making the game open, fast and exciting. Many games were even, with the final result in the balance right up to its conclusion.\nThe first round of the premiership saw both the Balmain and Sydney Clubs fail to put together a team to play their respective opponents. After this, both clubs withdrew from the competition. All future games that had been arranged against them would be declared forfeits with the opposing club receiving the points on the ladder.\nFrom the beginning of the season, Sydney University A were seen as the winners of the Agricultural Society Shield, based upon past performances. With the club having already won the Shield twice, a third win would see them become the permanent owners of it. They were also favourites to win the new Association Ground Cup. However, after losing their first game against Wallaroo, it was seen that the team were not of the same exceptional high standard of past teams. With many of their top players no longer part of the team, the Varsity did well to become runners-up for the premiership. After the regular season matches had concluded, they found themselves playing in both trophy finals, however losing both. The season saw the re-igniting of their old rivalry with the Wallaroo club, meeting their nemesis three times during the competition. The Varsity won only one of these matches with the other two finishing in close losses for the club.\nAfter defeating the Varsity in the first round, the Wallaroo Football Club played consistently during the season holding the pride of place on the ladder. The manner that the team defeated their long standing rivals demonstrated that they would be difficult to beat. The main strength of the team lay in its forwards, being a large pack. Their back line were not superstars, however they could hold their own on the field. Wallaroo had the fewest points scored against them across the season. The team finished the thirteen matches with eleven wins and one draw. Their only loss came at the hands of the Varsity, where they lost their best three-quarter and had to play the majority of the match with only fourteen players. Wallaroo won both the Agricultural Society Shield and the Premiership, their first victory since 1880.\nThe Randwick Football Club demonstrated a marked improvement in their performance during the Premiership. Their surprise win over Sydney University in the final for the Association Cricket Ground Cup raised the hopes of all. However the very next round saw them defeated by eventual premiers, Wallaroo. As a team, Randwick were one of the fastest with multiple sprinters in their pack but their forwards were too light.\nZealandia, last season's finalist, started the year strongly. Early in the premiership the team lost the services of their captain leading to their performance to fall away rapidly. The team narrowly missed the semi-finals for the Association Ground Cup and eventually bowed out in the semi-finals for the Agricultural Society Shield.\nNew to the Senior Badges, the Wentworth club held their own against the older teams. The reigning Junior Champions finished third after the regular season games, making the semi-finals for the Association Ground Cup. Unfortunately they were eliminated from the competition and lost their Qualifying round match against Zealandia. It was hoped that their success in the premiership would encourage other teams to make the step up into the Senior Badges.\nParramatta were a club that never quite reached their potential. As a team they contained many star players and it was believed that they should have finished higher on the ladder at the end of the season. With Fred Belbridge as captain, it was hoped that the performance of the club would improve in the future.\nAfter a splendid show last year, the Strathfield club were a miserable failure during 1892. Several of their best players left the club, with some quitting football altogether. The team were shaken by these exits and were unable to bring it together of the course of the season. Strathfield finished the season having only defeated the last placed University B team.\nWith as many as four teams spread across the Senior Badges and the Second Junior Badges, the Sydney University B team was seen to have lost the services of many players who played in the lower grades. It was believed that, if these players had chosen to through in their lot with them, the B team would not have finished at the bottom of the ladder.\nFinals.\nWeek 1, 13 August.\nAssociation Cricket Ground Cup semi-finals.\nThe semi-finals for the Cup were drawn through ballot with Wallaroo playing against old rivals Sydney University A, and Randwick taking on new comers Wentworth. Both games were scheduled to play on the Association Cricket Ground one after the other. In the first game, Wallaroo lost the services of their three-quarter, Strange, just before half-time. Even though Wallaroo now played with 14 men, a big handicap against the Varsity, the match remained pretty close. It was during the last twenty minutes of the match that University took command of the game and the scoreline blew out. The Randwick-Wentworth match proved to be a fast and exciting game. Wentworth began the match strong, but Randwick held their resolve. Eventually, Randwick took charge of the game and played what was considered to be their best performance up to that point. Wentworth were given a demonstration of effective passing and game play. The win saw Randwick progress to play against University in the Cup final.\nRoyal Agricultural Society Challenge Shield qualifying round.\nThe two qualifying round matches were played together on the Agricultural Society Ground. The draw saw Strathfield play Parramatta and Zealandia against Sydney University B. Poor crowd attendance at the ground saw a stubborn contest between two depleted teams in Strathfield and Parramatta. Parramatta managed to score a narrow victory to move on to the next week of the finals. A fast game was witnessed between Zealandia and University B, the play quickly moving from one end of the ground to the other. Despite the scoreline, the match was seen to be even between the two teams. Zealandia managed to win the match. With these two results, Strathfield and University B were eliminated from the competition.\nWeek 2, 20 August.\nAssociation Cricket Ground Cup final.\nMiserable weather in the days leading up to the Cup final and consistent rain during the game, saw the condition of the ground being very greasy. Considering the poor weather, a large crowd turned out for the match and grew with enthusiasm as the game progressed. Prior to the match beginning, it was the opinion of many that Sydney University A would win the match against Randwick. University drew first blood with James Moulton scoring a skilful try during the first ten minutes of the match. The wet and heavy ball made kicking goals difficult, however many in the crowd believed the Varsity were now certain for victory. Randwick held their own over the next ten minutes of the game and were rewarded with Allan Scott scoring a try to even the match. Once again, the heavy ball denied Randwick a goal. The game remained close with the scores level at half time.\nOn resumption of the game, university commenced a consistent attack on the Randwick line. Both Henry Abbott and Moulton took numerous shots at the goal from the field, however the sodden ground and wet ball made drop kicking difficult. Eventually play moved towards the other end of the field with Randwick finally on attack. A kick from William MacPherson saw the ball end up crossing the university line. Moulton attempted to fall onto the ball, but it slipped away with Tom McMahon diving onto it and scoring a try for Randwick. With the attempt at goal being unsuccessful, only five minutes was left of the match. After this second try, university went to great lengths to even the score. Abbott displayed superhuman effort, dashing off through the thick crowd of opponents carrying all before him until he sank beneath the grasp of several players. Randwick also got their blood up with the battle raging fiercer than ever. A grand game considering the slippery conditions ended with a victory for Randwick.\nRoyal Agricultural Society Challenge Shield qualifying round.\nThe draw for the second qualifying round saw Zealandia facing Wentworth and Wallaroo taking on Parramatta with both games being played alongside each other upon the Agricultural Society Ground. The first match was fairly well contested with eventual winners, Zealandia, having the best of things throughout. Wentworth played nothing like in their old form. Zealandia played at their best despite still not having their captain, Galloway, back on the field. With rain affecting both matches, the crowd was still a fair size. For their match, Parramatta were handicapped with the absence of some of their players. To field a team, they were forced to field five 'pick-ups' who played well. Wallaroo managed to score two tries in the first half of the match, unable to add goals to either due to the nature of the weather. Parramatta were able to score in the second half, but lost the match.\nWeek 3, 27 August.\nRoyal Agricultural Society Challenge Shield semi-finals.\nDespite the weather clearing up for the morning, the miserable conditions continued during the semi-finals for the Agricultural Society Shield. The first match saw Wallaroo drawn against Cup winners Randwick. Wallaroo won the toss and before ten minutes had passed, replacement player W Gregory had taken a mark with WS Corr kicking the goal from the field. The game became fast and open as a result of this with Frank Surman breaking through and scoring a try for Randwick. During the second half, Wallaroo had the better of their opponents, scoring a try to seal the win. The second semi-final began soon after the conclusion of the first. Sydney University A had the best of the game, stretching out to a comfortable lead in the first half. Zealandia were able to mount an attack on the Varsity line, but were unable to avert a defeat.\nWeek 4, 3 September.\nRoyal Agricultural Society Challenge Shield final.\nThe day of the Shield final saw a beating rain fall for the entire afternoon, however a solid crowd turned out for the match to support their clubs. Considering the conditions, it was expected that the forwards would play a major part in the outcome of the match. Both Sydney University A and Wallaroo put their best team on the field and played the game with great determination. The condition of the ground, due to the weather, was so slippery that it made play difficult. Both the university halfbacks, Henry Abbott and James Moulton, valuable players when the surface is dry, were made ineffective in the conditions. Players were unable to do a great deal of dodging or fending. Wallaroo were all over the Varsity players stopping them from passing the ball effectively, making the game a stop-start affair with short sharp rushes, scrimmages and good dribbling. It was a good deal into the second half before Wallaroo were able to score a try. This spurred both teams to greater efforts with University eventually holding down Wallaroo on their own line. Despite all efforts, the Varsity was unable to break through with the game ending. Thus the close of the football season saw Wallaroo win their first premiership in 12 years and the Agricultural Society Ground Shield.\nLower grades.\nJunior Badges.\nThe Junior teams had every reason to be proud of their performance during the season. The class of football played by the teams were at times equal to that of the senior grade. It was believed that many of the players should not be playing junior football, such was their skill. Junior matches were more often opener with passing and kicking more frequent. As the season progressed, the games played became more interesting and the competition became keener. For this season, Farmer &amp; Co. donated 15 silver medals for the winners of the First Junior competition.\nThe competition for the Junior Badges saw a strange ending to the season. After beating all comers during the year, The Pirates Football Club were unexpectedly beaten in the final by Carlton. The fact that Carlton was victorious in the final did not provide conclusive evidence that they were the better team during the competition. Losing their first match of the season against the Pirates, Carlton improved as the year progressed. The form team for much of the season was the Pirates, being far superior to any other team during a greater part of the year. Unfortunately for them, the Junior Badges did not follow the same format for awarding the premiership as the senior grade. If it did, the Pirates would have been declared Premiers despite their finals loss. Double Bay finished the season with the third best record, however they displayed inconsistency with their performance. The Glebe were believed to be the champion junior of the year but failed to live up to those expectations. In the end Carlton finished the season with the record of winning two premierships in two years but in different grades.\nSecond Junior Badges.\nThe quality of play of many of the Second Junior teams was appreciated by the public. The form of the eventual champions, Sydney University 2nd was superior to that of a Second Junior team. Their play, especially the kicking, was even better than some of the senior teams with one or two of the players capable of playing for the University B or A team. For much of the season, both the Pirates 2nd and Double Bay 2nd teams led the running for the premiership. It was regarded that the final would be played between these two. Amongst the other teams, Ryde continued to show improvement as the year progressed with the team eventually losing to the Varsity in the final. Randwick Borough showed good form only to be eliminated in the semi-final. University 2nd were awarded medals once again donated by AJ Torning.\nThird Junior Badges.\nFor 1892 those clubs entered into the Third Junior Badges would be competing for the Union Medals. The competition saw two teams finish the regular season without loss, Willoughby and Waverley A, with both teams having no points scored against them. Willoughby was defeated by eventual premiers Surry in the quarter-finals, the only points scored against them all year. The Surrys had suffered only one defeat in their run towards the championship in the first round against Willoughby. Surry went on to defeat the heavier Grosvenor team in the final. Grosvenor had amassed the greatest number of points during the season and on their way to the final had disposed of Waverley in the semi-final. The final was expected to be a close and exciting affair however Surry had the better of the match and won easily.\nRepresentative games.\nIntercolonial matches.\nNSW v. Qld. first match, 23 July.\nThe first Intercolonial game of the season saw what was possibly the biggest crowd seen at the Association Cricket Ground for a football match. The members stand, grandstand and public enclosure were well populated with estimates for the size of the crowd being close to 10,000.\nA strong wind was blowing when the game commenced, New South Wales kicking off. Initial play saw the ball moving back and forwards between the two teams as they pressed hard into each other's territory. AD Graham kicked a few attempts at goal, missing both. James Moulton made some slippery linebreaks, the Queenslanders unable to get their hands on him. Eventually, Queenslander Jack O'Shea received a pass from Fred O'Rourke and broke away from the line. Percy Colquhoun chased him in vain with O'Shea scoring near the corner flag. The kick from Graham fell short. After the restart, a failed run from Colquhoun and Frank Surman resulted in Queensland earning a shot at goal from New South Wales' 25. F O'Rourke missed his attempt. A few plays later, Billy Warbrick intercepted a pass and kicked and chased towards the New South Wales line. GC Matherson gathered the ball and got across the line to score for Queensland. Graham missed his attempt at kicking for a goal. Half time was soon called with Queensland leading 6 points to 0.\nOn returning to the field, New South Wales were without Jim Cowan, who had been injured in the first half. From the kick off play continued to seesaw between the two teams' 25's. Philip Phillips attempted a shot at goal for New South Wales, lacking the direction to be successful. Play soon returned to the Queensland 25 with a kick from O'Shea, against the wind, sending the ball back into their own corner. Moulton, Surman and Vernon Reed were not successful in grounding the ball with the Queenslanders forcing in goal. A run from Warbrick and Petterson took the ball back to the New South Wales line with some exciting play right near the line. At length, O'Shea crossed the line and scored for Queensland with F O'Rourke missing another kick for goal. As soon as play was restarted, Queensland were on the attack again with both O'Rourke brothers attempting shots at goal. Play swung towards the Queensland 25 with New South Wales making a number of attempts at kicking a goal. At length, O'Shea intercepted a pass and made the run of the match. The Queenslander ran down the sideline, escaping two tackles and scored. F O'Rourke attempted another shot at goal, failing to add more points to the Queensland total. The final whistle was blown soon after to end the match.\nThe final result of the game was a surprise to both the crowd and New South Wales. Even the Queensland players themselves could not believe that they had held onto the win against the wind. Adopting the plan that the British Rugby team had when they played their matches in Sydney, Queensland played three quarters and three halves making the forward pack weaker but the backs stronger. Their forwards were strong in the scrimmage and their backs gave no chance for the New South Welshmen to get through. The Queenslanders played right up to the ball throughout the game, smothering the passing and running from their opposition.\nNSW v. Qld. second match, 30 July.\nThe return match between New South Wales and Queensland was held on the Association Cricket Ground on the 30 July. After the result of the first game and the resulting changes made by the local team, there was much interest in the match. With a slightly strengthened forward team and the inclusion of sprinter \"Tot\" Martineer in the squad, there was hope that the recent defeat would be reversed. The Queenslanders fielded an almost identical team from the previous game. Fine weather met the players as they entered the field to a loud reception. New South Wales won the toss and kicked off against the wind with Queensland defending the northern goal.\nFrom the kick off Fred O'Rourke brought the ball back to half way. Getting a hold of the ball, Martineer managed to make a run towards the Queensland 25. After a lot of scrimmaging, Edward Bowman made a break towards the Queensland line only to be stopped by captain William Warbrick. More scrimmaging within the Queensland 25 saw Ernest Roberts collect the ball and cross the try line. George Lusk took the kick and managed to score the two points. After the restart F O'Rourke took the ball into the New South Wales 25. Several scrimmages back at half way saw Paterson kick the ball back towards the New South Wales line. AD Graham followed up, collected the ball and pushed his way across the try line. Graham then failed to successfully take the kick. The score was now New South Wales 5, Queensland 3. Exciting play in the New South Wales 25 followed the kick off. Multiple rushes from the local team saw play move to the Queensland 25 where they were awarded a free kick. Lusk took the kick and cleanly sent the ball over the crossbar. New South Wales were now up by 6 points. Play immediately moved into the New South Wales 25 from the kick off. F O'Rourke made a dodgy run, breaking through a tackle and over the try line. Graham took the kick, failing to get the extra points. The lead for New South Wales was now only 3 points. When New South Wales kicked off, offside was called as some of their players were ahead of the kicker. A scrimmage on the New South Wales line was the penalty. Lusk managed to kick the ball out of danger before Queensland brought it back. A pass from F O'Rourke sent Jack O'Shea over the try line near the corner. The kick was taken by H Paul but was another failure with the ball falling short. With the scores now tied at 9 a piece, scrimmaging near the New South Wales 25 saw Danny Allman pass out to F O'Rourke who neatly potted a goal from the field. Further play that took the ball from either end took the game up to half time. At the whistle, Queensland were 4 points in front, 13 points to 9.\nThe beginning of the second half saw an exchange of kicks between New South Wales and Queensland. A line break by Charlie O'Rourke at the New South Wales 25 saw O'Shea miss a pass and more scrimmaging taking the ball back to the centre of the ground. Quick passing from Queensland lead to O'Shea making another dart for the New South Wales line. Just as he was in reach of scoring, James Moulton took him into touch. Play continued to move back and forth between the two ends with O'Shea making a failed attempt at a field goal. Moulton soon had an opportunity himself for a drop goal, but the ball was blocked by the Queenslanders. From the throw in, a line break by New South Wales forward Fred Belbridge was stopped before he could cross over. Queensland kicked out to the half-way line where Roberts caught the ball and dashed back inside the Queensland 25 where he was brought down by George Hensler. New South Wales kept the pressure on the defenders until the ball was slowly pushed back to wards the half-way line. A kick took the ball into the New South Wales 25 where O'Shea looked like a certain scorer. Moulton and Martineer pulled him down before he could cross over. Queensland managed to force the ball further on and eventually onto the try line where J Todd leapt onto it and scored. The kick failed to add to the score. No sooner as the ball was kicked the play moved back into New South Wales territory. An intercept by Queensland led to a play that went from wing to wing. O'Shea crossed over and scored again, the kick again failing. The final whistle blew soon after with Queensland in front 19 points to 9.\nDespite the radical alterations made by New South Wales, the result still finished against them. The game proved to be essentially one for the forwards, with the New South Wales back line not having much of an effect on the match. Moulton was able to make more runs than in the first match and Lusk provided effective goal kicking. Martineer scarcely got a chance to display his impressive skills, only touching the ball once or twice during the match. Except in goal kicking, Queensland won at all points in the game. Every man was at his best and played an excellent game throughout."

        "text": "Carl Taylor \"Zeke\" Martin (December 17, 1884 – March 1, 1976) was a college basketball player and coach, as well as a mechanical engineer. He was a player-coach for the Vanderbilt Commodores in 1911 and 1912. He was a forward. Charles C. Stroud selected him All-Southern in 1911. According to Stroud, \"Martin is not only fast on his feet, and a good shot, as every forward must be, but he is slippery and quick to dodge or wriggle from the bunch. Only a rugged guard can cover him, as he is strong at shaking free.\" He was also an end on Dan McGugin's Vanderbilt football team. He was a native of Mobile, Alabama and is the namesake of nearby Zeke's Landing, and the \"Mar\" in Romar Beach. He was once suspended from coaching the team for spending extra days on the beach in Mobile."

        "text": "The Women's Professional Snooker Championship was a snooker tournament organised by the Women's Billiards Association. Held ten times, the event was first played from 1934 to 1941, and again from 1947 to 1950. Across all ten editions, only four players reached the final. Ruth Harrison won eight of the events, with Agnes Morris and Thelma Carpenter winning the others.\nThe Women's Billiards Association was established in 1931, and instituted an amateur snooker tournament two years later, after initiating championships for English billiards. Their professional snooker championship was first held in 1934, and was open to players from England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and the Irish Free State. At the time, women's snooker gained less coverage than women's English billiards.\nHarrison, who won the inaugural title, had started playing the game two years earlier. In the semi-final, she eliminated her coach Eva Collins. In the final, she defeated Joyce Gardner, as she had in the final of the Women's Professional Billiards Championship a few days earlier. Harrison won each instance of the annual event to 1940, and claimed her eighth title when the tournament was re-established in 1947, after it had been suspended during World War II. She did not participate in the 1949 tournament as she felt that holding the event in June meant it would fall outside of the annual snooker season, and only Carpenter and Morris entered for the 1950 championship.\nThe first tournaments were held at Burroughes Hall, London, and the events from 1947 took place at Leicester Square Hall, London. The last time that the tournament was held, in 1950, Carpenter took the title, a few days after winning the World Women's Billiards Championship event. Gardner and Carpenter were the only two entries for the 1951 championship, which was due to be staged at the Albright and Wilson Recreation Club in Langley, but Gardner withdrew because of her mother's illness, and that year's event was cancelled. The 1950 event proved to be the last time the tournament was held, as public interest in the contest declined.\nThe Women's World Open in 1976 and 1980 were later recognised as the first editions of the World Women's Snooker Championship. Gardner, three-times Women's Professional Snooker Championship runner-up, was the top seed in 1976, and Morris, the 1949 champion, reached the final in 1980."

        "title": "1983–84 Bowling Green Falcons men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1983–84 Bowling Green Falcons men's ice hockey team represented the Bowling Green University in college ice hockey. In its 5th year under head coach Jerry York the team compiled a 34–8–2 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the fifth time. The Falcons defeated Minnesota–Duluth 5–4 in the fourth overtime to win the championship game at the 1980 Olympic Arena in Lake Placid, New York, the longest title game in NCAA history.\nSeason.\nEarly season success.\nBowling Green was champing at the bit after being left out of the 1983 Tournament despite winning the CCHA and having a better record than the team picked ahead of them, Minnesota–Duluth. The Falcons got off to a good start with a sweep of visiting Clarkson but when they opened their conference schedule the following week they could only manage a split with Lake Superior State. Losing to an inferior team appeared to galvanize the team and the Falcons proceeded to win the next 17 contests, the longest streak in program history. Through two months Bowling Green scored no fewer than 4 goals in each of their games and though they started out with Wayne Collins in net (their only goaltender with NCAA experience) Gary Kruzich soon became the go-to goalie. Even when Bowling Green was limited to 2 goals the defense showed up and allowed the Falcons to win the KeyBank Tournament. The streak finally ended with a 5–6 overtime loss at Michigan and a week later the team ended up with a tie against Ferris State.\nDefensive cracks.\nThe Falcons regained their footing when they played at home for the first time in over a month against Northern Michigan and after earning 3 points against Illinois–Chicago in early February Bowling Green guaranteed themselves their third consecutive CCHA title. With little to play for Bowling Green played a bad game against Western Michigan, allowing a season-high 8 goals against before earning a split. The following weekend they welcomed in Division III Michigan–Dearborn and dominated the obviously outmatched Wolverines but the lack of a challenge did not help BG right the ship and the squad split their final weekend against cellar-dwelling Miami.\nCCHA tournament.\nWith the program record for wins in sight (37) the team appeared to get back to normal when they opened the tournament with a home win against Lake Superior State but they were back in the losing column after game 2. Fortunately the first round was a total-goal series and the close loss in the second game didn't cost BGSU too much. In the semifinal at the Joe Louis Arena Bowling Green faced Western Michigan and the Broncos showed no fear in facing down the Falcons and the two teams fought to a 3–3 tie through regulation. Kruzich kept the Falcons in the game but future NHLer Glenn Healy couldn't be beaten and in the second overtime WMU scored to end Bowling Green's chance at the conference championship. The Falcons had a chance to redeem themselves in the consolation game but against fell in overtime, this time to Ohio State.\nNCAA tournament.\nEven with losing three consecutive games Bowling Green still had the second best record in the country and the selection committee gave them an at-large bid, slotting them third in the west. As a lower seed, BGSU started the tournament on the road against Boston University and the Falcons still could not break out of their losing skid, dropping the game 3–6. With the team needing to win the second game by 4 goals to advance they had their work cut out for them but Gary Kruzich played one of his best games, holding BU to a single goal while the Falcons scored 4 goals in regulation, and added the series winner in overtime.\nThe miraculous turnaround sent Bowling Green to Lake Placid for the second time that season where the Falcons faced the #1 offensive team and the only squad with more wins (33), Michigan State. Once more the defense was instrumental in Bowling Green's win, shutting the Spartans down and winning 2–1.\nOvertime Epic.\nIn the championship game BGSU only had Minnesota–Duluth left standing in their way but the #1 ranked Bulldogs looked to be a tough test. Bristling with talent and possessing Hobey Baker Award winner Tom Kurvers, UMD looked to get the jump on Bowling Green early but it was Garry Galley who notched the game's first goal with a shot that somehow found its way through a mass of bodies. Duluth responded with their own goal 20 seconds later and two teams remained tied for the next period plus. Bill Watson broke the tie past the mid-way point of the game while Bob Lakso extended the lead at the start of the third period. With the team down by 2 goals with 19 minutes to play, Bowling Green began firing shot after shot against Rick Kosti and eventually the Falcons' leading goal-scorer Jamie Wansborough broke through with a power play marker. With over 15 minutes to play the Falcons had plenty of time to tie the score but with Duluth playing in a defensive shell their opportunities were limited. The situation became dire when UMD regained their 2-goal advantage with 8 minutes to play but the Falcons responded immediately and cut the lead back to 1. Bowling Green had a good opportunity to tie the game late on a power play but they couldn't convert and as the clock kept ticking it appeared that Minnesota–Duluth was going to win the national title. With less than two minutes to play, team co-captain Wayne Wilson fired the puck into the Duluth zone from the red line. When Kosti went behind the net to play the puck it hit something along the boards and bounced out into the crease and, with three Bulldogs around him, John Samanski poked the puck into the net to tie the game.\nWith the Duluth faithful screaming that the play should have been icing the two teams restarted play and fought furiously in the final 90 seconds before heading into overtime. In the first overtime UMD nearly ended the game but Kruzich stopped a semi-breakaway by Lakso and neither squad could find the back of the net. The game became the first title game to need more than one extra frame but it did not stop there. Kruzich and Kosti kept the score tied until deep into the fourth 10-minute overtime. With both teams exhausted leading BG scorer Dan Kane found Gino Cavallini alone in front of the net and the sophomore backhanded the puck past Kosti's leg to end the longest championship game in NCAA history (as of 2019).\nAwards and honors.\nGary Kruzich became the third consecutive goaltender to win the tournament MOP as much for his overtime heroics as for holding BU and MSU to single goals in the previous two wins. However, Kruzich had to share his All-Tournament team spot with UMD's Rick Kosti, the only time in history that any position was split between two people (as of 2019). Kruzich was joined on the All-Tournament team by David Ellett and Garry Galley while Galley and Dan Kane made the AHCA All-American West Team and the All-CCHA First Team Ellett and John Samanski were named to the CCHA Second Team while none of the individual conference awards went to the Falcons.\nThe championship was the first for any CCHA team and demonstrated that the conference could compete with the other major powers of the college hockey world.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "title": "Boxing on ABC",
        "text": "Boxing on ABC refers to a series of boxing events that have been televised on the American Broadcasting Company. Many of these events aired under the \"Wide World of Sports\" banner which began on April 11, 1964 when challenger Muhammad Ali, then known as Cassius Clay, defeated champion Sonny Liston in the seventh round. ABC's final boxing card occurred on June 17, 2000.\nHistory.\n\"Tomorrow's Boxing Champions\" (1949–1950).\nThe first incarnation of boxing telecasts on ABC was \"Tomorrow's Boxing Champions\", which aired on Tuesday nights beginning in January 1949. Originating from Chicago, the program featured young, unranked fighters. Bob Elson did the blow-by-blow commentary. The series concluded in September 1950.\n\"Meet the Champ\" (1952).\nIn January 1952, ABC premiered \"Meet the Champ\", which was a collection of bouts involving members of the armed forces. The program aired on Thursday nights, with Wally Butterfield announcing.\n\"Saturday Night Fights\" (1953–1955).\nIn 1953, Ray Arcel began promoting bouts on ABC. Unfortunately, shortly after arranging the fights for ABC, Arcel ran afoul of organized crime. The matches on ABC competed with other network television fights run by the International Boxing Club (IBC), who were reputed to have underworld ties.\nBill Stern did blow-by-blow commentary when \"Saturday Night Fights\" premiered. Come the fall, Jack Gregson took over from Stern.\n\"Boxing from Ridgewood Grove\" and \"Motor City Boxing\" (1953).\nIn February 1953, ABC premiered \"Boxing from Ridgewood Grove\". It aired on Tuesdays nights, with Jason Owen as the announcer in the first month and Bob Finnegan taking over until its cancellation in August. In March 1953, ABC brought \"Motor City Boxing\" from Detroit. The program would air for three months of Thursdays, with Don Wattrick at the providing commentary.\n\"Boxing from Eastern Parkway\" (1954).\nIn May 1954, \"Boxing from Eastern Parkway\" moved from the DuMont Television Network to ABC. Tommy Logran handled the blow-by-blow commentary while occasionally being helped by Bob Finnegan and Fred Sayles. The series ended when ABC failed to renew its contract with the arena after picking up the rights to show fights at the International Boxing Club.\n\"The Wednesday Night Fights\" (1955–1960).\nAfter cancellation of \"Pabst Blue Ribbon Bouts\" on CBS in 1955, the series was picked up by ABC, renamed \"The Wednesday Night Fights\", and continued until 1960.\nRuss Hodges and Jack Drees both stayed with the show when it transferred from CBS. Hodges however, left in October 1955 and Drees was the only regular announcer for the five years it stayed on ABC.\n\"Fight of the Week\" (1960–1963).\nAfter NBC-TV's cancellation of \"The Gillette Cavalcade of Sports\" in the spring of 1960, ABC took over the prime time boxing program, although it was renamed \"Fight of the Week\". Legendary boxing commentator Don Dunphy did the blow-by-blow description of the bouts, which took place on Saturday beginning in October 1960 and running through September 1963.\nFrom there, the series moved to Friday nights, where it continued until ABC finally canceled prime time boxing after the bout of September 11, 1964, permanently ending 18 years of regularly scheduled prime time boxing on U.S. broadcast network television. One reason for the downturn of televised boxing occurred on \"Fight of the Week\"'s the March 24, 1962 broadcast, when Emile Griffith defeated Benny \"The Kid\" Paret for the Welterweight Championship at New York's Madison Square Garden. Paret was carried from the ring unconscious, and died several days later as a result of his injuries that he had sustained in that bout.\n\"Wide World of Sports\" (1964–2000).\nPrior to the advent of \"Wide World of Sports\", many major heavyweight boxing title matches were televised via \"closed-circuit\" (this generally meant that you had go to a movie theater to see it, pay a decent-sized amount of money to get it, and then watch it on a giant screen). Often, \"Wide World of Sports\" would show full-length replays of the fights a week or two later; these replays were usually called by Howard Cosell, who became one of the best-known (and possibly most controversial) sportscaster in American television history.\nStill rebuilding a winning record after his first professional loss to Joe Frazier, Muhammad Ali faced Ken Norton on March 31, 1973, at the Sports Arena, San Diego, California. The fight was aired live on free TV in the United States via ABC.\nJerry Quarry retired for over two and a half years after his 1975 fight with Ken Norton fight. At around this time, Quarry signed a contract with ABC to be a boxing commentator. Quarry was very popular in this position, drawing the ire of Howard Cosell, who was being pushed out of some commentary work by Quarry. In mid-1977, a return match was being put together which would put Quarry in against a ranked heavyweight. The ranked heavyweight would be Italian Lorenzo Zanon. The match was to be televised on ABC, where Quarry was contracted. But both fighters signed to have the bout televised on CBS. When Quarry, who often negotiated his own fight contracts, signed the bout to CBS, he lost his ABC contract.\nIn 1976, ABC made a deal with promoter Don King and \"The Ring\" magazine to stage a tournament to determine the best fighter from the U.S. in each weight division. The tournament, dubbed the United States Boxing Championships was scheduled to begin on January 16, 1977 with ABC agreeing to finance the tournament with an investment of between $1.5 million and $2 million. Soon however, it determined that King was essentially using the tournament to sign the best fighters to exclusive contracts. To make matters worse, \"The Ring\" was falsifying records and inflating rankings as a means of getting a number of fighters into the tournament for King.\nSugar Ray Leonard's bout with Wilfred Benítez on November 30, 1979 marked the first time in the era of big-money sports events that a non-heavyweight fight would be carried as the main event on prime time television.\nOn November 15, 1984, ABC broadcast 'A Night of Gold', a card from promoter Dan Duva's 'Main Events', featuring no less than four gold medal winners (Mark Breland, Tyrell Biggs, Pernell Whitaker and Meldrick Taylor) from that year's Summer Olympic games, as well as those lagging behind in the runners-up spots.\nIn 1992, ABC announced plans to counterprogram the Winter Olympics on CBS with boxing, a sport at that point, seldom seen on network television. This particular boxing series was sponsored by Fruit of the Loom. ABC proceeded to forgo the typical $300,000 rights fees of the prior year, and instead, set a $75,000 limit and scheduled three consecutive Saturdays of action.\nCommentators.\nHoward Cosell.\nCosell rose to prominence in the early 1960s, covering boxer Muhammad Ali, beginning from the time he fought under his birth name, Cassius Clay. The two seemed to have an affinity despite their different personalities, and complemented each other in broadcasts. Cosell was one of the first sportscasters to refer to the boxer as Muhammad Ali after he changed his name, and supported him when he refused to be inducted into the military. Cosell called most of Ali's fights immediately before and after the boxer returned from his three-year exile in October 1970. Those fights were broadcast on taped delay usually a week after they were transmitted on closed circuit. However, Cosell did not call two of Ali's biggest fights, the Rumble in the Jungle in October 1974 and the first Ali–Joe Frazier bout in March 1971. Promoter Jerry Perenchio selected actor Burt Lancaster, who had never provided color commentary for a fight, to work the bout with longtime announcer Don Dunphy and former light-heavyweight champion Archie Moore. Cosell attended that fight as a spectator only. He would do a voiceover of that bout, when it was shown on ABC a few days before the second Ali-Frazier bout in January 1974.\nPerhaps his most famous call took place in the between Joe Frazier and George Foreman for the World Heavyweight Championship in Kingston, Jamaica in 1973. When Foreman knocked Frazier to the mat the first of six times, roughly two minutes into the first round, Cosell yelled out:\nHis call of Frazier's first trip to the mat became one of the most quoted phrases in American sports broadcasting history. Foreman beat Frazier by a TKO in the second round to win the World Heavyweight Championship.\nCosell provided blow-by-blow commentary for ABC of some of boxing's biggest matches during the 1970s and the early 1980s, including Ken Norton's upset win over Ali in 1973 and Ali's defeat of Leon Spinks in 1978 recapturing the Heavyweight title for the third time. His signature toupee was unceremoniously knocked off in front of live ABC cameras when a scuffle broke out after a broadcast match between Scott LeDoux and Johnny Boudreaux. Cosell quickly retrieved his hairpiece and replaced it. During interviews in studio with Ali, the champion would tease and threaten to remove the hairpiece with Cosell playing along but never allowing it to be touched. On one of these occasions, Ali quipped, \"Cosell, you're a phony, and that thing on your head comes from the tail of a pony.\"\nWith typical headline generating drama, Cosell abruptly ended his broadcast association with the sport of boxing while providing coverage for ABC for the heavyweight championship bout between Larry Holmes and Randall \"Tex\" Cobb on November 26, 1982. Halfway through the bout and with Cobb absorbing a beating, Cosell stopped providing anything more than rudimentary comments about round number and the participants punctuated with occasional declarations of disgust during the 15 rounds. He declared shortly after the fight to a national television audience that he had broadcast his last professional boxing match.\nIn the 1976 Summer Games in Montreal, and the 1984 games in Los Angeles, Cosell was the main voice for boxing. Sugar Ray Leonard won the gold medal in his light welterweight class at Montreal, beginning his meteoric rise to a world professional title a few years later, and Cosell became close to Leonard, during this period, announcing many of his fights.\nCancelled 2007 card.\nSeven years after ABC's last boxing card, they were scheduled to broadcast a card from Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey on April 22, 2007. The card would've featured former light heavyweight champion Antonio Tarver facing off against Elvir Muriqi. Promoter Joe DeGuardia of Star Boxing had been working on the time buy deal (in other words, DeGuardia was not paid a licensing fee by ABC, but rather bought an hour of time from the network). The production would've been handled by ABC's sister company, ESPN with \"Friday Night Fights\" commentators Joe Tessitore and Teddy Atlas. The bout was ultimately scrapped amid rumors that Tarver would not be able to make the 175 pound weight limit.\n\"Premier Boxing Champions\" (2015).\nOn March 19, 2015, ESPN announced that \"Friday Night Fights\" would air for the final time on May 22, 2015, covering the finals of the 2015 Boxcino tournament. The network announced that it had reached a multi-year deal with Al Haymon's \"Premier Boxing Champions\" to broadcast 11 events per-year on the main ESPN network, primarily on Saturday nights, and an afternoon event on ABC. Joe Tessitore and Teddy Atlas were carried over to serve as hosts. ESPN is one of several major broadcasters that airs fights through the promotion, which also includes NBC, CBS, their respective cable sports networks, as well as Spike."

Gregorek took them through a 43.7 first 300, while José Carlos Villarreal worked his way into the third position in line. They remained in that position through the next lap at 1:44.2. Through the penultimate lap, Federico Bruno moved forward, poking into the lead at the bell in 2:45.1. Through the turn, Gregorek held him to the outside, a little jostling, then Bruno accelerated into the lead. Paulson followed Bruno and accelerated into a 3-metre lead down the backstretch as Bruno strained and Gregorek moved back into second place. Gregorek slowly gained to be in position to sprint past Paulson coming off the turn, executing his move and pulling away from Paulson. However, halfway through the turn, Villarreal launched into a sprint to get around Bruno. He kept his sprint going after the leaders. By the time he caught them, he was in a different gear and was no match, going on to take the win by 4 metres. This kind of kick is not a surprise to YouTubers.

Brazil's first leg, Rodrigo do Nascimento blazed the turn to give them a clear lead at the first handoff while the rest of the staggers remained true. Down the backstretch, Trinidad and Tobago's Olympic double Olympic medal relay veteran Keston Bledman and Jamaica's 2015 relay world champion Rasheed Dwyer put their teams into contention.

A strong final handoff for Brazil to 100 silver medalist Paulo André de Oliveira and Brazil was gone to take gold. Trinidad made a smooth handoff from Akanni Hislop to Kyle Greaux and would have no challenge for silver after Jamaica's Oshane Bailey and USA's 100 gold medalist Mike Rodgers had to look back for their handoff.

        "title": "Archery at the 2019 Pan American Games – Women's individual recurve",
        "text": "The women's individual recurve archery event at the 2019 Pan American Games was held from 7 August to 11 August at the Villa María del Triunfo sports complex in Lima, Peru. One of eight archery events as part of the 2019 Pan American catalogue of sports, it was the eleventh time the women's individual recurve competition had been contested at the Games. Thirty-two archers from fourteen nations qualified for the event.\nThe defending champion from the 2015 Pan American Games was Khatuna Lorig of United States. Lorig was defeated in her bid to become a back-to-back Pan American champion in the final by Mexico's Alejandra Valencia, who triumphed in five sets to win the gold medal for the second time, reclaiming the title she had previously won in 2011. Lorig finished with the silver medal, with Casey Kaufhold of the United States winning the bronze medal ahead of Colombia's Ana Rendón.\nOne qualification spot for the women's individual event at the 2020 Summer Olympics was available to the nation of the highest-ranked archer which had not already qualified for the Olympic Games. As Mexico and the United States had already achieved qualification spots prior to the conclusion of the event, the position went to Colombia through Rendón's fourth-place finish.\nBackground.\nQualification.\nA total of thirty-two qualification spots were available for the competition. Twenty-four places were reserved for the eight nations each entering the maximum berth of three archers through qualification for the women's team recurve event. The remaining eight places were available for the individuals of nations that had not already achieved a qualification spot. As host nation, Peru automatically qualified one individual place. Qualification was earned through two tournaments, the Pan American Archery Championships held in August 2018 in Medellin, Colombia and a secondary tournament held in Santiago, Chile in April 2019. Chile, Colombia, Bolivia, Brazil, Mexico, and the United States each qualified a team of three archers from the 2018 Pan American Archery Championships, Bolivia achieving qualification places in the women's archery event for the first time. Canada and Cuba later secured maximum berths at the Santiago tournament the following year, with Peru adding a second entry to their sole automatic qualifying spot. Six other nations additionally secured at least one qualification place over the two tournaments.\nKhatuna Lorig, the defending champion from the Toronto Games four years previously, successfully qualified through the United States national team selection alongside newcomers Erin Mickelberry and 15-year-old Casey Kaufhold, with 2016 Summer Olympics competitor Mackenzie Brown as the reserve. Aída Román and Mariana Avitia, silver and bronze medalists at the 2012 Summer Olympics, were selected alongside Alejandra Valencia to form the Mexican team, the trio entering as the three highest ranked archers competing in the Games, Valencia the highest at world number 10. The host nation's team of two archers included the reigning Peruvian national champion Aleska Burga García. The inclusion of Graziela Paulino dos Santos within the Brazilian team marked the first time an indigenous Brazilian athlete was selected to compete at the Pan American Games.\nFormat.\nThe women's individual was an outdoor recurve target archery event held to the World Archery-approved rules. Archers shot at a 122 cm-wide target from a distance of 70 metres, with between one and ten points awarded for each arrow depending on how close it landed to the centre of the target. The competition consisted of three stages spread over five days: an initial ranking round, four elimination rounds, and two finals matches, which decided the winners of the gold, silver, and bronze medals. In the ranking round, each of the 32 archers entering the competition shot a total of 72 arrows. The total score of each archer was used to seed the archers into the following four-round single-elimination tournament, the number one seed going to the highest-scoring archer.\nThe elimination rounds used the Archery Olympic Round set system introduced at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Each match consisted of a maximum of five sets, with archers each shooting three arrows per set. The archer with the highest score from their three arrows, for a maximum of 30, won the set, earning two set points. The archer with the lowest score in each set received zero points. If the score was tied, each archer received one point. The first archer to reach six set points was declared the winner. If the match was tied at five set points each after the maximum five sets were played, a single tie-breaker arrow was used with the archer shooting closest to centre of the target winning.\nReport.\nAlejandra Valencia topped the ranking round on the opening day of the competition with a new continental and Pan American Games record of 675 points, finishing thirteen points clear of Casey Kaufhold, whose total of 662 was a personal best, and twenty-two points clear of third-placed Aída Román. Defending champion Lorig placed sixth on 642 points.\nElimination rounds.\nThe beginning of the elimination rounds on 8 August saw Bolivia's debut in the women's individual event come to a premature end, with Ebe Fernandez, Dhara Claros, and Ana Micaela Espinoza Garcia all losing in the 1/16 elimination round in straight sets. Chile's three entrants also suffered early exits. Isabella Bassi, the highest-placed Chilean archer in the ranking round, and Javier Andrades both lost in the opening round, the former falling to Guatemala's Cinthya Pellecer after shooting an eight to Pellecer's nine in a one-arrow shoot-off. Only Catalina Márquez Rojas of Chile's trio advanced beyond the first round after ending as the surprise victor in her encounter against ninth-seed Elizabeth Rodriguez of Cuba. She would later bow out after defeat to Erin Mickelberry in the second round. Brazil's three entries also fared poorly, with Graziela Paulino dos Santos losing in the opening 1/16 elimination round and Ane Marcelle dos Santos and Ana Sliatchicas Caetano departing shortly afterwards in the 1/8 elimination round. Caio Fiusa of \"Lance!\" subsequently described the day as \"not a happy Thursday\" for Brazilian archery.\nThe quarter-finals, which followed into the afternoon of 8 August, featured seven of the eight top seeds. Of the highest-placed archers from the ranking round only the seventh seed, Canada's Stephanie Barrett, failed to reach the last eight, having lost to Maira Sepulveda of Colombia - who finished 26th the previous day - in the 1/16 elimination round. The first quarter-final contest saw top seed Valencia defeat Erin Mickelberry in a one-arrow shoot-off after tying on five set points each, advancing to the semi-finals as the sole Mexican left in the competition; both of Valencia's teammates were eliminated in the following quarter-final contests, Román losing to Lorig and Avitia being defeated by fourth-seed Ana Rendón. Pellecer, the lowest seeded archer to progress to the quarter-finals, lost to Kaufhold in straight sets in the final quarter-final match. The progression of both Lorig and Kaufhold to the semi-finals, along with the successful American showing in the team events, marked the United States archery team's strongest international performance of the year.\nFinals.\nAfter a two-day break the competition resumed on Sunday, 11 August for the two semi-final and the two medal-deciding matches. Valencia defeated Rendón in straight sets to advance to the gold medal final against Lorig, who defeated her younger teammate in an all-American second semi-final. As the two losing semifinalists, Rendón and Kaufhold went on to contest the third-placed match for the bronze medal. In a straight sets victory Kaufhold emerged victorious, her bronze medal earning her a third of the Games after earlier gold medal victories in the women's team and mixed team events.\nIn Valencia and Lorig the gold medal final pitted the 2011 and 2015 Pan American champions against one another. After three sets Valencia and Lorig were tied, but two near-perfect scores of 29 in the fourth and fifth sets was enough for the Mexican to pull ahead, winning by seven set points to Lorig's three. Valencia's win earned her a second Pan American individual gold medal and her third medal overall of the 2019 Games. Speaking after her victory Valencia said she enjoyed the match and was able to recover from some mistakes, adding \"Let’s pretend Toronto didn’t happen as I didn’t make the finals there... I shot well today and the results followed.\" Ricardo Gutierrez of \"Yahoo! Deportes\" praised her style of play, writing that she showed \"mettle, concentration, and definition in her shots\" in overcoming the more experienced Lorig.\nValencia's win was Mexico's sole victory in the archery competitions of the 2019 Pan American Games and the nation's 37th gold medal of the Games, its highest Pan American tally away from home.\nResults.\nElimination rounds.\nBottom half.\n &lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 2019–20 World Rugby Sevens Series was the 21st annual series of rugby sevens tournaments for national men's rugby sevens teams. The Sevens Series has been run by World Rugby since 1999–2000.\nIn March 2020, World Rugby postponed all remaining tournaments in the series due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The events in London and Paris were postponed provisionally until September, preceding the Singapore and Hong Kong events previously postponed until October. On 30 June, the remaining four rounds of the series was cancelled which meant that New Zealand was awarded the title by 11 points over second-placed South Africa.\nFormat.\nSixteen nations competed at each event, drawn into four pools of four teams each. Following the pool matches at each tournament, the top eight teams (two teams from each pool) played off for a Cup, with gold, silver and bronze medals also awarded to the first three teams. The bottom eight teams after the pool matches played off for the lower-ranked placings from ninth to sixteenth at each tournament. The winner of the series was determined by the overall points standings gained across all events in the season.\nChallenger Series and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWorld Rugby announced in December 2019 that there would be a feeder competition to the Sevens Series consisting of sixteen teams that would play two sevens events in South America, determining the final eight teams to play in a playoff-style event at the Hong Kong Sevens. The final winner would be promoted to the World Rugby Sevens Series and replace the invitational side in the Sevens Series.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, World Rugby postponed the Sevens Series and Challenger Series seasons to be completed at a later date in the year before subsequently cancelling the season entirely. Because of both competitions seasons being cancelled, the final playoff in Hong Kong to decide the team who would be promoted to the Sevens Series would not be decided and the team with the highest points tally would be the promoted team. Japan, an invited team to five of the six Sevens Series events was promoted having accumulated thirty-nine points in total, three points clear at the top of the table.\nCore teams.\nThe fifteen \"core teams\" qualified to participate in all series events for 2019–20 were: \nIreland joined as a core team for the first time after winning the 2019–20 World Series qualifier held in Hong Kong. They replaced Japan who were relegated after finishing as the lowest-placed core team in 2018–19. However, Japan will play in several tournaments as the wild card team in preparation to host the Olympic tournament.\nTour venues.\nThe official schedule for the 2019–20 World Rugby Sevens Series was:\nEvents in Singapore and Hong Kong were originally scheduled to be played in April 2020 but were postponed due to health concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and rescheduled to October 2020. In June 2020, World Rugby cancelled all four remaining rounds of the tournament (Singapore, Hong Kong, England and France) due to the pandemic.\nStandings.\nOfficial standings for the 2019–20 series:\nNote:\nPlayers.\nScoring leaders.\nUpdated: 11 March 2020"

        "title": "1913 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1913 Auckland Rugby League season was the 5th season of the Auckland Rugby league.\nThe first grade competition began on 3 May with the same 6 teams that had competed in the 1912 season, however Manukau Rovers pulled out of the competition midway through the season as they struggled to put a full team on the field. The Eden Ramblers also pulled out at the same time. North Shore Albions were crowned champions for the first time.\nOther clubs competing in lower grades were Otahuhu, Northcote Ramblers now known as the Northcote Tigers, and Ellerslie Wanderers, who later became known as the Ellerslie Eagles. A match was also played between Avondale and New Lynn in Avondale on 13 September. The match was won by New Lynn by 23 points to 8.\n \n \nNews.\nSwitching codes.\nKarl Ifwersen switched from rugby union where he had been playing in Auckland and made his debut appearance for North Shore Albions. He was to go on to have a remarkable rugby league career and his scoring feats were un-rivalled through the 1910s in Auckland rugby league. While New Zealand representatives Graham Cook and Cecil King had moved from Wellington and made debut appearances for Newton Rangers.\nCharles Savory controversy.\nIn a match involving Ponsonby and Manukau in Onehunga, Charles Savory was accused of kicking an opponent. The incident was not seen by the referee but an Auckland Rugby League official claimed to have seen it and as a result Savory was banned for life by Auckland Rugby League. Savory had been selected to play for New Zealand on their tour of Australia and as a result of the ban was unable to make the trip. When the evidence was presented to New Zealand League they said that the evidence was not sufficient to justify the penalty and refused to confirm it. Auckland Rugby League then decided to strike Savory off the list of registered players thus making him ineligible to play in Auckland. Auckland selector Ronald MacDonald chose Savory to play against Wellington in their match on 23 August but was told at an Auckland Rugby League meeting that he was ineligible and they questioned why he had chosen him to play. MacDonald replied \"one reason is because he is one of the best forwards in the Dominion. What was he suspended for?\". A lengthy discussion followed and MacDonald refused to withdraw Savory's name from selection and a motion was then passed that MacDonald be removed from his position as Auckland selector. This was carried unanimously with Mr Angus Campbell appointed selector, and Morgan Hayward chosen to replace Savory in the side for the match with Wellington.\nDeath of Adolphus Theodore Bust whilst playing.\nTragedy struck in May in a 3rd grade match between Ellerslie and Ponsonby when 26 year old Adolphus Theodore Bust was severely injured and later passed away as a result of his injuries. The death occurred at the Ellerslie Domain. He was said to have collided with an opposing player and the two of them fell to the ground with a third player falling on top of them. The other two men rose to their feet to carry on playing but Bust remained stationary on the ground. Dr. Baber was called to attend from his residence in Remuera but he found that Bust's spinal cord was fractured near the base of the skull and he recommended he be taken to hospital however Bust's father decided to have him taken to his home in Ellerslie. He was unable to be revived and died at 8.30am the following morning. After the incident the deceased father said he witnessed the incident and was satisfied that it was an accident. Martin Ellis, the player involved in the tackle said that he was running down the field and Bust was waiting to tackle him and had dived and caught Ellis by the legs but his neck struck him on the hip and they both fell to the ground. The coroner returned the verdict that nobody was to blame for the death. None of the Ellerslie teams took the field the following weekend out of respect and the Auckland Rugby League bore the costs of the funeral.\nMyers Cup (first grade competition).\nEighteen regular season matches were played before North Shore Albions were awarded the title with a 5 win, 1 draw, 1 loss record.\nMyers Cup fixtures.\nRound 1.\n Karl Ifwersen debuted for North Shore in their 13-0 win over Newton after switching from rugby union. He later became the first ever person to play for the New Zealand rugby league team and then the New Zealand rugby union team. George Cook debuted for Newton Rangers in the same game. He had previously played rugby union in the Horowhenua, Manawatu, and Wellington areas representing all three provinces. He had joined the Athletic club in Wellington in 1912 and played for New Zealand but did not take the field for the club side so this game was his first club game in the code. Jim Clark also made his debut for Ponsonby in their 31-5 win against Eden at Victoria Park and scored a try. He had switched codes from the Ponsonby rugby club. Clark would go on to play 7 matches for Auckland and 12 for New Zealand. Bertram Denyer scored Eden's only try in their loss. After the Eden side dropped out of the competition he joined the Newton Rangers. He enlisted in the war effort and was killed in action at Gallipoli on May 8, 1915. Samuel Houghton played for Ponsonby. He had the unusual accomplishment the following year of playing for England in their tour match against Wellington. The team was injury depleted and rather than play with 12 he was allowed to play for England. He had emigrate to New Zealand with members of his family not long prior and his father, Jack, was one of the England tour managers.\nRound 2.\nR Clark for Newton scored a remarkable 5 tries either on debut or a week after. He had joined the Newton side from the Ponsonby third grade team of a season prior. Brennan also scored a try from halfback and had come across from the Otahuhu juniors.\nRound 3.\nFor Eden Don Kenealy did not take the field as the result of \"some little disagreement\". It meant that the team was somewhat depleted and a decision was made to play two short spells. They ended up being soundly beaten 19-0 and would soon exit the competition for good.\nRound 4.\nIn the Ponsonby match with North Shore Harry Fricker was ordered off for striking at Alfred Jackson. The act was missed by the referee but seen by the line umpire. The match between Manukau and Eden was reported as a win to Manukau and a win to Eden in differing reports.\nRound 5.\nManukau defaulted their match to North Shore Albions. The later arrived in Onehunga to find that their opponents could not muster a team with only Arthur Hardgrave and \"three or four others\" turning up. Jim Rukutai and other prominent players were said to be suffering from influenza. This was to be Manukau's last game in the senior grade for decades as they forfeited the following week along with Eden and dropped out of the senior competition. Rukutai was diagnosed with smallpox and was put into isolation in a Point Chevalier hospital. However it was soon after realised that he was actually suffering from a severe case of chicken pox and he made a full recovery soon after. Eden were to cease playing as a club a few seasons later and never returned. The New Zealand side was on tour in Australia so several sides were missing their international players. Frank McWhirter debuted for Ponsonby after having played for their 3rd grade side immediately prior. Charles Webb scored all Ponsonby's points through 2 goals from marks, a penalty, and a drop goal. George Cook's try for Newton provoked a huge response from the crowd after he raced away and leaped over the top of Ponsonby fullback, Montgomery to score under the posts.\nRound 6.\nA somewhat unusual event occurred in the match between Ponsonby and North Shore when it was briefly suspended after a player from North Shore dropped his false teeth. He was inevitably subjected to some “good-natured banter from the crowd”. It was complained that the match at Victoria Park was kicked off at 3:30 and concluded in near darkness while it should also have been played in front of the stand as there were between 4 and 5 thousand spectators crammed around the sideline with the game needing to be stopped at times due to them encroaching on the field. The excuse by the authorities was that league damages the main field more than other sports.\nRound 7.\nWith Manukau and Eden both disbanding their senior teams Pullen from Manukau transferred to North Shore and played for them, Arthur Hardgrave also transferred to the North Shore but did not take the field, while Don Kenealy of Eden transferred and played for City. William Wynyard turned out to assist the North Shore side for the first time in the season with his brother Hec playing on the wing, while Sheen debuted for them having come across from the Marist rugby side. Victor Alexander McCollum scored a try for Ponsonby. He had previously played rugby for the South Auckland (Waikato) side and was from the Karangahake area. He was killed at the Somme, on September 26, 1916 aged 25.\nKnockout competition.\nAfter North Shore had won the championship the league decided to play a knockout competition between the four remaining teams. Newton and City both won their matches and progressed to the final. Cross was on debut for Ponsonby and had played in their second grade game an hour earlier.\nKnockout final.\nCity were joined by Jim Rukutai for the match following Manukau's senior team disbanding. It was his first game back after recovering from a very serious bout of chicken pox.\nTop try and point scorers.\nScoring included both the first grade championship and the knockout matches. A large number of matches did not have the scorers named meaning the following lists are incomplete. Points missing are as follows: Newton Rangers (22), City Rovers (18), Ponsonby United (25), Eden Ramblers (15), and Manukau Rovers (18).\nExhibition Match.\nHamilton v City Rovers.\nOn July 19 City Rovers traveled to Hamilton to play the local side.\nAvondale v New Lynn.\nOn September 13 Avondale played New Lynn in their \"annual football match\". Several of the players including Bertram and John Denyer, Emmet Kenealy, Bond, and Bob Biggs had played for the recently folded Eden Ramblers who were based in the Avondale/Point Chevalier area.\nThacker Shield.\nOn 7 September North Shore Albions journeyed to Christchurch to play against Sydenham to play for the Thacker Shield. At the start of the season Dr. Thacker, president of the Canterbury league had presented the shield for competition amongst the senior clubs of Christchurch but he had stipulated that it was open to competition to any club in New Zealand. When North Shore won the Auckland championship they immediately issued a challenge to Sydenham. North Shore sent a strong team south but were without Karl Ifwersen and Stan Walters who were representing New Zealand against the touring New South Wales side.\nLower grades.\nThe draws were always reported in the New Zealand Herald and the Auckland Star however only some of the results were reported in the Monday editions. As a result the tables are incomplete and are compiled of known results.\nSecond grade standings.\nPonsonby won the championship undefeated for the second year though Otahuhu did manage to draw with them 5-5 on June 7. Ponsonby defeated Otahuhu 22-9 in the final on July 19. The Ellerslie side withdrew from the competition following the death of 3rd grade player Adolphus Bust. He was seriously injured during a match in May and died later in the evening.\nThird grade standings.\nPonsonby won the championship after defeating City Rovers 16-5 in the final on August 9. For Ponsonby R. Neil scored a try, kicked a conversion and kicked a drop goal, while Coulan and Adams also scored tries. City's points came from a try to James which he also converted. The Ellerslie side withdrew from the competition following the death of 3rd grade player Adolphus Bust who was seriously injured during a match in May, passing away later that evening.\nFourth grade standings.\nOtahuhu defeated Ponsonby in the championship final on July 19 though no score was reported.\nRepresentative season.\n1913 was a very busy year for the Auckland representative team as they played 10 matches recording a 7 win, 3 loss record. Their three defeats were against the touring New South Wales team and then on a two match end of season tour to Taranaki and Wellington. Angus Campbell was their selector for the season.\nThe first representative fixture of the season was played on 28 June against a Country selection at Victoria Park, Auckland. Three thousand spectators attended and 117 pounds was collected. Further matches were played against Taranaki, Hawke's Bay, Nelson, Canterbury, Wellington, and New South Wales. Auckland also played an exhibition match in Pukekohe against the Auckland club champions North Shore Albions.\nOn August 9 Auckland Juniors beat Waikato Juniors 33-5 in Huntly.\nRepresentative matches.\nAuckland V Hawke’s Bay (Northern Union C.C.).\nGeorge Seagar was not named in the original side to play but replaced Cecil King prior to kick off in the front row.\nAuckland V Nelson (Northern Union C.C.).\nThe match was refereed by George Frater who was from the Hawkes Bay referees association. He was on holiday from Hawkes Bay after their side toured the previous weekend. He was an ex-captain of Oldham in England. A trial match was played as curtain-raiser between A and B teams resulting in a win to the former by 11 points to 3.\nAuckland B v North Shore Albions.\nThe match was played as a curtain raiser to Auckland v New South Wales.\nAuckland v New South Wales.\nWilliam Tobin went on for the injured Alan Blakey and George Seagar replaced Harold Hayward who was also injured. Both players had played in the curtain raiser for Auckland B and North Shore Albions respectively. The match was attended by Auckland Mayor, James Parr who complained after the match about the large number of spectators who crowded on to the field during the game and threatened that is the rugby league authorities could not guarantee they would be prevented from the field for the following weeks test match then he would ban them from playing the match on the Auckland Domain.\nAuckland v Taranaki.\nThomas McClymont injured his arm late in the first half and went off but came back on. Then early in the second half he retired permanently meaning Auckland only had 12 players. Bob Mitchell and Stan Walters joined the team in New Plymouth having left Wellington after the New Zealand match there. Karl Ifwersen was supposed to also join but he had been injured in New Zealand's match so went directly back to Auckland. George Seagar who had gone on tour was refereeing at late notice as Taranaki had been unable to organise a suitable referee. The Taranaki forwards were said to have dominated the match and while the Auckland backs played brilliantly they failed to finish many chances.\nAuckland v Wellington.\nA player named 'Murdoch' appeared for Auckland and this is likely to have been the treasurer/manager of the Auckland side Adam Murdoch. There were no team lists in any of the newspapers and only 12 players were mentioned by name in the match reports. When Murdoch passed away in September 1944 the Auckland Rugby League sent their condolences to his family. Those were Mansell, Cook, Woodward, Kenealy, Tobin, Seagar, Webb, Murdoch, Mitchell, Walters, Rukutai, and Denize. The other one who may have played is Clark, Manning, or Fricker who had all been with the touring side in Taranaki."

        "title": "1914 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1914 season was the sixth season of Auckland Rugby League since its formation in 1909. It followed the 1913 Auckland Rugby League season where North Shore Albions were crowned senior champions for the first time. The senior grade saw the addition of Otahuhu Rovers, who had previously competed in the lower grades only, and Grafton Athletic. The Manukau Rovers and Eden Ramblers no longer contributed teams. The first grade was won once again by North Shore Albions.\n \n \nAt a meeting of Auckland Rugby League on 9 May it was decided that the proceeds of ticket sales at club games would be split 50–50 between the teams and Auckland Rugby League. Interest in the competition continued to grow with 5,000 attending the 3 senior matches played at Victoria Park on 20 June. There were 3,000 in attendance at the North Shore Albions game versus City Rovers in the Round 8 clash at the Devonport Domain. While 4,000 attended the Round 9 match between City Rovers and Ponsonby United at Victoria Park. There were 7,000 spectators for the final between North Shore Albions and Ponsonby United.\nWhilst attendances were spectacular at times there were still signs that the competition was in its infancy with teams often playing one or more men short. The worst case being in the Round 9 match where Newton Rangers could only field eight players, with two spectators from the crowd later joining them as they were defeated by 43 points to 2 by North Shore Albions.\nNear the conclusion of the season a match was played at Victoria Park between a team of veterans and Auckland colts on 29 August. It raised £27 and 10 shillings for the Patriotic Fund. Also a \"Patriotic Carnival\" was held on 5 September. A fancy dress carnival paraded around town with Highland pipers and a brass band. It proceeded to the Auckland Domain where a 3rd grade match was being played between Remuera and Ponsonby United 3rd Grade teams, and a ‘Burlesque’ football game was then played. Finally a match was played between the North Island Jockeys and Newton 3rd grade team which the jockey's won 11–6. £49 was raised for the Patriotic Fund.\nSeason news.\nLower grade clubs.\nTeams which fielded sides in lower grades were the Northcote Ramblers, Hobsonville Pirates, Sunnyside (based in Devonport), Remuera United and Manukau. The Sunnyside and Remuera United clubs were both new. The Sunnyside club would later amalgamate with North Shore Albions and form the Devonport United club, which later reverted back to the North Shore Albions name. While Remuera fielded sides in 1914 and 1915 before the war wrecked their playing ranks. They reformed again in 1927 but only lasted until the end of the 1929 season.\nRepresentative season.\nThe Auckland representative campaign got underway with a match versus the touring England team where the home side lost. However the Auckland Rugby League made over £500 from the 13,000 in attendance. They also received £200 in gate takings from the match with Wellington at Victoria Park.\nMyers Cup championship.\nAfter three weeks of practice in inclement weather the competition commenced on 16 May.\nMyers Cup standings.\nThe standings include the final between North Shore and Ponsonby won by North Shore by 13 points to 2.\nMyers Cup fixtures.\nRound 1.\nOtahuhu's beginning to senior rugby league got off to an inauspicious start when they began their match with just nine players. At halftime they were brought up to a full thirteen when substitutes arrived. Percy Williams who had previously represented Auckland at rugby union before being signed by Wigan where he played from 1910 to 1913 had returned to Auckland. He had played for New Zealand on their tour of Australia as a late addition mid tour. He turned out for the City Rovers and played his debut match against Otahuhu. Bill Walsh debuted for Ponsonby but broke a bone in his foot. For Grafton, Alan Douglas Gibbs Dawson debuted for them at fullback. He had been a successful athlete at Auckland Grammar School and a member of the College Rifles rugby club before switching to rugby league. He played 4 matches for Grafton during the year and in 1915 enlisted in the war. He was killed on April 25 (ANZAC DAY), 1915 at Gallipoli.\nRound 2.\nAfter the injury to Bill Walsh, the New Zealand international, Charles Webb, was called back in to service in his old position at halfback for Ponsonby. He had been a spectator in round 1. Bizarrely Len Farrant kicked 3 goals for City against his own Newton side that he played for in the week prior and would play for again later in the season. There was nothing around a transfer or transfer request in the newspapers.\nRound 3.\nEdward Fox scored a try on full time to win the game for North Shore over City 8-6 at the Auckland Domain. Sixteen years later the premier club trophy in Auckland would be named after him. Ernie Asher scored all of City's points through kicks at goal. It was noted in the Auckland Star that Asher had been jeered when he took shots for goal by sections of the crowd which numbered in the thousands and which also encroached on the field several times. Towards the end of the match after Fox's try the crowd were inciting the players and rough play resulted with two players sent off. The newspaper reports had brought up the lack of any fencing being an issue at these matches which were drawing large crowds at the Domain and Victoria Park each week. The two players ordered off and another from another senior match were not named and were let off with warnings.\nRound 4.\nThe City v Ponsonby game was notable for the constant penalties awarded by referee Dick Benson. The Auckland Star reported apologised in their piece for the \"monotony\" of their report. There were 8 penalty goals kicked and numerous other attempts missed along with several shots for goal from marks. In the end the two tries City scored were the difference over Ponsonby's one, winning 16-13. Grafton secured their first ever senior grade win, with Karl Ifwersen scoring all of their 12 points from 2 tries, 2 conversions and a penalty. The league was providing an official matchday program for sale at the games for three pence, however it was complained that the players were taking the field without numbers making the team lists near useless. Cecil Louis Walker debuted for Grafton, playing in the forwards. He played 6 matches for them through the season and enlisted in the war effort. He was killed in action at the Somme, France on 16 September, 1916 aged 28.\nRound 5.\nIn the match between Grafton and City both Albert Asher (City) and Bob Mitchell (Grafton) were ordered off midway through the second half. William Ernest Fincham, a former Taranaki league representative scored a try for Grafton. He had played for Taranaki against Auckland in 1911. It was after referee William Wynyard had awarded Fincham's try that he saw the two players (Albert Asher and Bob Mitchell) \"strangling each other\". Mitchell was a former City player. At the time the crowd was also said to be \"completely out of control\". Both players denied doing anything wrong though Mitchell had suggested that it was apparent throughout the match that his former team mates were out for him. Both players were severely cautioned during the following week. Sam Lowrie scored his first ever try for Ponsonby. He had been named in their squads for several weeks but it was the first confirmation that he had actually taken the field. He would go on to play for New Zealand be one of New Zealand's outstanding hookers in its early decades. His grand nephew was Jason Lowrie who also represented New Zealand.\nRound 6.\nKarl Ifwersen received an injury to his jaw the previous week but played in round 6 only to injure the area again. A trip to the doctor revealed that it had been dislocated. A crowd of 5,000 packed into Victoria Park to see the matches. It was a charge day for the Auckland rugby league and they made an estimated 100 pounds. The fields were also fenced which kept the spectators off the field for the first time in many weeks.\nRound 7.\nGeorge Gillett was granted a transfer from the Newton Rangers (where he was a life member) to the Ponsonby United club. The transfer needed the casting vote of the chairman before it was confirmed. He debuted for Ponsonby in their match with Otahuhu. Charles James Hally scored for Otahuhu in their 13-9 loss to Ponsonby. He enlisted in the war effort the following year and was killed at Gallipoli on July 26, 1915. Barnard Longbottom scored for Ponsonby. He would go on to become a prominent official for Ponsonby and Auckland Rugby League throughout the 1910s, 20s, and 30s.\nRound 8.\nThe match between North Shore and City was originally scheduled to take place at Victoria Park but was transferred to the Devonport Domain. The crowd of over 2 to 3,000 was said to have been the biggest crowd ever seen at the ground. The match was 'gated' and the league profited by around 25 pounds. The home team won 9 points to 7 thanks to a try to Stan Walters and 3 goals kicked by Jack Paul. Otahuhu won their first game of the season defeating Newton 10-5 at Victoria Park.\nRound 9.\nIn the match between Otahuhu and Grafton, Montrose (Monty) Stanaway, the Otahuhu captain was ordered off the field by referee Tyson for disputing a decision. He was the younger brother of Alex Stanaway and Jack Stanaway. The match between North Shore and Newton was a farce with Newton only mustering 8 players. Two of the spectators joined the Newton team who were being trounced and the match finished 43 to 2 in favour of North Shore. The newspapers did not bother recording the point scorers though they did mention that the Shore side gave everybody in the team a chance to kick for goal.\nFinal.\nA record crowd of 7,000 packed the Victoria Park sidelines with a sum of 300 pounds taken at the gates for the final which was a record for club games in Auckland. Ernie Bailey, one of the North Shore forwards dislocated his shoulder 15 minutes before full time but played on. Ponsonby played George Gillett at an extremely wide first five position which was criticised as they would indulge in long passing but make little progress, or else Gillett would kick too often. Beecham played out of position on the wing partly due to Ponsonby playing an extra back as they had the week prior.\nTop try scorers and point scorers.\nNone of the North Shore point scorers from their farcical Round 9 match with Newton Rangers were credited and therefore the following lists will be inaccurate as 43 points were scored by them. Of note in the point scoring lists is the prodigious scoring of Karl Ifwersen with 63 points. Indeed, Grafton only scored 75 points in total meaning he in all probability scored the highest percentage of team points in Auckland Rugby League history.\nLower grades.\nWhilst the draws were published in the New Zealand Herald and Auckland Star each Thursday, the results were only intermittently reported in the same newspapers on the Monday following games. On June 20 the Auckland Star gave the standings in all grades to that point so these tables have been pieced together from those standings and later reported results. As such the standings are incomplete though roughly accurate. Grades were made of the following teams with the winning team in bold.\nSecond grade.\nNorthcote &amp; Birkenhead Ramblers were awarded the second grade championship after August 8 as they were so far ahead of the trailing teams. Sunnyside defaulted their first match against Northcote and then withdrew from the competition. Northcote were given 2 competition points for the default but as no other side had the opportunity to play them those points were disallowed.\nFourth grade.\nThe fourth grade competition was terminated early owing to so many of its players enlisting in the military forces. City Rovers won the championship. \nRepresentative fixtures.\nAuckland began the representative season with a match with the touring England side who were on their first ever tour of New Zealand. Film footage exists of the match and is archived on the New Zealand Archive of Film, television and Sound Ngā Taonga website. Auckland was defeated 34–12 in front of 13,000 paying spectators at the Auckland Domain which allowed Auckland Rugby League to collect £519 and 2 shillings.\nAuckland representative matches played and scorers.\nThe following list includes the 4 matches that the Auckland A team played and excludes the Auckland B team match."

        "text": "The 2021–22 international cricket season took place from September 2021 to April 2022. 29 Tests, 111 One Day Internationals (ODIs), 112 Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is), 25 Women's One Day Internationals (WODIs), 40 Women's Twenty20 Internationals (WT20Is), and two women's Test matches were scheduled to be played during this period. Additionally, a number of other T20I/WT20I matches were also scheduled to be played in series involving associate nations.\nThe 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup, the 2021 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier and the 2022 Women's Cricket World Cup were played in October 2021, December 2021, and March 2022 respectively, after they were all postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the final of the Men's T20 World Cup, Australia beat New Zealand by eight wickets to win their first T20 World Cup. In the final of the Women's World Cup, Australia beat England by 71 runs to win their seventh World Cup.\nQualification for the 2023 ICC Women's T20 World Cup also continued, with four more regional qualifiers taking place. In August 2021, England's planned tour of Bangladesh was postponed until 2023 due to the ongoing Covid situation and fixture congestion. Later the same month, Afghanistan's planned ODI series against Pakistan was postponed due to the situation in Afghanistan and the logistics in travelling. In November 2021, Cricket Australia officially postponed the one-off Test match between Australia and Afghanistan, due to the Taliban not supporting women's cricket.\nIn September 2021, New Zealand arrived in Pakistan to play three ODIs and five T20I matches. It was New Zealand's first tour of Pakistan since 2003. However, on the morning of the first ODI match, New Zealand Cricket (NZC) raised a security alert with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and the Pakistan Government, which resulted in the entire tour being called off. England were also scheduled to tour Pakistan for the first time in sixteen years to play two T20I matches. However, following New Zealand's tour being called off, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced that the men's tour and the women's tour to the country in October 2021 had both been cancelled, due to concerns of travelling to the region.\nIn October, the Zimbabwe women's cricket team played their first ever WODI matches since they were granted WODI status by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in April 2021.

        "text": "Sandy Cohen III (; born September 22, 1995) is an American-Israeli professional basketball player for Bnei Herzliya of the Israeli Basketball Premier League. A standout at Seymour Community High School who led the team to two Bay Conference championships, Cohen played college basketball for Marquette University and later the University of Wisconsin–Green Bay. Cohen went undrafted in the 2019 NBA draft, and signed a four-year contract with Maccabi Tel Aviv in August 2019.\nEarly life and high school career.\nCohen was born in Green Bay, Wisconsin, U.S. to Linda King and Sandy Cohen, Jr. Cohen's family are members of the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin, and he is of Jewish descent through his father. Cohen has 3 siblings, including Connecticut Sun player Natisha Hiedeman. \nHe attended Seymour Community High School, winning two Bay Conference championships in 2012 and 2014, and receiving First Team All-Conference honors twice.

Citing a desire to play more and have a larger role on the team, Cohen requested to be released from his scholarship at Marquette in November 2016 after playing three games of his junior season. He subsequently announced he would be transferring to Green Bay.\nGreen Bay (2017–2019).\nDue to NCAA transfer rules, Cohen was to sit out the 2016–17 season and would have had only one year of eligibility remaining.

Cohen's first appearance with Green Bay was on December 21, 2017 against Bowling Green State University, scoring 16 points and grabbing six rebounds. His redshirt junior season in 2017–18 saw Cohen increase his career high in points to 36, receive Horizon League Player of the Week honors for the week of February 22, and lead the Horizon League in steals (1.8 SPG) while ranking sixth in scoring with 17.1 points per game.\nHis redshirt senior season, Cohen led the Phoenix in all statistical categories, set Green Bay's single-season scoring record at 666 points, and received multiple awards and accolades from the Horizon League and beyond.\nProfessional career.\nMaccabi Tel Aviv.\nCohen went undrafted in the 2019 NBA draft, and played for the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Summer League, while also working out with the Minnesota Timberwolves and Indiana Pacers.

        "title": "1911 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1911 Auckland Rugby League season was the second full organised club season in Auckland following the 1910 Auckland Rugby League season. City Rovers won the title again after winning it in the competitions inaugural year.\n \nThe club season commenced on 20 May, with the start of the competition for the Myers Cup. City Rovers were crowned champions after defeating Ponsonby United in the final 36–15 which was required due to both teams being within 2 points of each other as the competition entered its closing stages. The competition at the time and for decades to come often did not complete full round robins. When a team had an unassailable lead over their nearest rivals the competition was often concluded at that point. Ponsonby and City had already met twice during the season but rather than conclude the round robin with round 10. In round 10 Ponsonby would have had a bye and City would likely have gained an easy win over wooden spooners, Eden Ramblers so the Auckland Rugby League decided to have the two top teams play off for the title a week early rather than prolong the competition.\nThe City side featured Albert Asher, Alex Stanaway, Jim Rukutai, and Bob Mitchell, while Ponsonby had Charlie Savory, Charles Dunning and Arthur Carlaw.\nAuckland Rugby League news.\nReminiscing about the league's formative years.\nIn 1941 at the annual meeting the chairman of the league in 1911 (Mr. B. Brigham) spoke about the league in its formative years. He said \"the seeds sown by the pioneers have developed in a wonderful way... when we first started playing, the matches were at Victoria Park. For funds we used to go around with a hat. Then we started taking boxes round, and if at the end of the day we were \"shy\", we had to have a tarpaulin just to pay for the ground\". He went on to say that \"plenty of mud was thrown at us those times, and we had to face a good deal of hostility. Our first meetings were held in the cellar of the Rob Roy Hotel, and then we got the use of the social room in the same hotel. Then we drifted to other rooms, and a home of our own\". He also talked of venues and said \"at one time the league had a lease of Eden Park at £100 a year, and from there they shifted to Victoria Park, where on one occasion they had a £300 gate, a figure that was not beaten until the 1924 season at Carlaw Park.\nVenues.\nUnlike in 1910 when only two venues were used, there were 5 venues used. They were Victoria Park, Takapuna Racecourse, 'Avondale', Auckland Domain, and Eden Park (which was the venue for the club final between City Rovers and Ponsonby United.\nEden Ramblers formed.\nThe senior competition saw the addition of the Eden Ramblers who had been formed in April. A meeting was held at the Avondale Public Hall on Wednesday 26 April with Mr John Bollard, MP presiding over it. He was elected president and chairman, and the name Eden Ramblers was chosen along with the colours or green and gold. The following officers were selected: Hon Secretary, Mr B Boone; Management Committee, W. A. Cummings, J Eddoes, W Fairweather, M Morrow, and J Denyer. The membership was close to 50 and they were to begin their training for the season ahead on 29 April with a joint practice with Ponsonby United at Victoria Park.\nRugby union converts.\nAt the start of the season George Gillett, Arthur Francis, Alan Blakey, and Frank Morse all switched codes. Gillett and Francis had both played for the All Blacks for several seasons and were joining the Newton Rangers along with Blakey who was a well known Auckland rugby player. Morse was joining the City Rovers. Gillett, Francis, and Morse would all go on to represent the Kiwi's.\nRepresentative season.\nIt featured a representative programme in August and September where Auckland played nine matches including two against the New Zealand side. They won eight and lost one. Their first match saw them lose to New Zealand however they rattled off consecutive wins against New Zealand (6 weeks later), Wellington, Lower Waikato, Hawke's Bay, Nelson, Taranaki, Hawke's Bay Māori, and a Country team from Waihi &amp; Rotorua.\nMyers Cup (first grade championship).\nEighteen regular season matches were played before the final on 16 September where City Rovers defeated Ponsonby United 36 to 15 to retain the title which they had won in 1910.\nFirst Grade competition.\nMyers Cup standings.\nThe second round did not feature the final round of matches hence Ponsonby playing an extra match (when they were due to have a bye), while the table also includes the final played between City and Ponsonby.\nMyers Cup results.\nRound 1.\nCharles Savory had switched from the Ponsonby rugby union club to the Ponsonby rugby league side and made his debut, scoring a try in their 19-3 win. He was a controversial figure, going on to represent New Zealand and also Australia on their 1911-12 tour of Great Britain as one of four New Zealanders chosen to tour with the side. In 1913 he was found guilty of kicking and suspended for life though the NZRL quashed the conviction. In 1914 he won the National Amateur Heavyweight Boxing championship. Savory went away to fight in World War 1 but was tragically killed at Gallipoli in 1915. For City Jim Rukutai scored two tries in their 13-3 win after having joined the side late the previous season. William Moeki scored a try on debut for City. He enlisted in the war effort and was killed in action at Gallipoli on April 25, 1915. Hec Wynyard was knocked out playing for North Shore with play stopping for some time.\nRound 2.\nDon Kenealy made his debut for the Eden Ramblers against Ponsonby. He would go on to become their only New Zealand representative, playing 4 matches for New Zealand in 1912. After the Eden club, which was based in the Avondale/Pt Chevalier areas folded in 1913 he moved to the City Rovers for the 1913-15 seasons before retiring aged just 22 as he soon left for World War 1 before returning and marrying in 1917.\nRound 3.\nFor the North Shore side Stan Weston was on debut. He scored a try as did other New Zealand internationals Jim Griffen, and George Seagar all scored tries while Alfred Jackson kicked one of their conversions. Weston's younger brother Lyn Weston played rugby union for New Zealand. The match between City and Ponsonby at Victoria Park drew a crowd of 2,000.\nRound 4.\nIn the match between Newton and Eden one of the three tries was unattributed but it was said that the try scorers were Short and Linkhorn so one of those players scored twice but it is unknown which. The North Shore fullback Weri Puki had to leave the field due to an injury to his face, while team mate Stan Weston had to go off with a sprained ankle.\nRound 5.\nIn the City match with Eden Albert Asher was tackled by four opponents and held down. J Simpson, the City fullback took exception and after the referee had blown his whistle to stop play, Simpson struck an Eden player and was sent off. The crowd was agitated by the incidents and play had to be stopped for several minutes until the field was cleared of them. The Takapuna Racecourse was in a poor state. Something which had been commented on in previous matches. While the venue was considered a great one to view matches from it was only drawing small crowds with the argument being that it was relatively difficult to get to with a boat needed to reach Devonport and then either a bus or 15 minute walk to reach the ground. Stan Walters scored 2 tries for North Shore after debuting for them weeks earlier. He would go on to play 62 games for them as well as representing Auckland 16 times, and New Zealand 31 times before moving into the Waikato region and playing for Hamilton and Waikato in the 1920's.\nRound 7.\nThe match between Ponsonby and Eden was played on the Avondale Racecourse. The sports fields were located at the eastern end of the racecourse grounds. Eden took the field with just 10 players and played the entire match with that number.\nRound 8.\nIn the match between City and Ponsonby at the Takapuna Racecourse there were several injuries. The field was still in poor condition. George Harrison (City) sprained an ankle, George Hunt (City) ruptured the muscles of his shoulder, and Warner (City) had his nose \"severely injured in a collision with Arthur Carlaw (Ponsonby) who was partly stunned and sustained a cut to his forehead\". The Eden v Newton match saw 500 spectators turn up to the Domain but the match was described as \"never at any time bright or interesting\", though forward, Frederick Gladding was singled out for playing very well on the Newton side.\nRound 9.\nThe Takapuna Racecourse ground was \"in a shocking condition with mud and water, and all the players were plastered with filth at the end of the game\". Though the game itself was interesting with North Shore attacking at the end but failing to overcome Ponsonby who held on to win 14-13. Samuel Houghton suffered internal injuries during the match for Ponsonby and was said to be ruled out for the remainder of the season however he was able to play in the senior final on September 16, 2 months later. Eden managed the first senior win in their history but it was against a Newton side that played 3 men short the entire game.\nFinal.\nThe final was played to raise money for charity and was staged at Eden Park for the first time in the season. Both teams were particularly strong featuring several players who had missed most of the club season owing to being in Australia with the New Zealand side. City won easily 36 to 15 after leading 23-5 at halftime before Ponsonby threatened to make a game of it with some early second half points getting back to 23-15. For City internationals Jim Rukutai, Albert Asher, Bob Mitchell, Alex Stanaway all scoring tries and Albert Asher kicking 6 conversions. For the losers Charles Dunning scored twice. At one point in the second half R.W. Roope of Ponsonby struck an opponent and was sent off. The Ponsonby team was going to leave the field but after some discussion decided to play on.\nTop point scorers and try scorers.\nThe Ponsonby v Eden match in Round 2 had 23 unattributed points for Ponsonby (5 tries and 4 goals) and 5 for Eden (1 try and 1 goal), while the Round 4 match between Newton and Eden saw a try to Newton unattributed. As such the following lists are likely to omit tries and points for players from those sides. Albert Asher played the full season for City while his brother Ernie Asher traveled to Australia to play for New Zealand. Albert, while in the later stages of his career still played consistently well for City and kicked 6 goals from 8 attempts in the final against Ponsonby. Charles Dillimore scored 10 tries for Ponsonby in their wing.\nLower grades.\nA junior representative match was played between A and B teams as curtain-raiser to the New Zealand v Auckland match at Takapuna Racecourse on July 29. Harry Oakley and Frederick Gladding had been appointed selectors for the junior representative matches. The match featured Edward Vincent Fox who the Fox Memorial Shield would later be named after.\nThe teams were; A team: Liversidge (Ponsonby), A Hawthorne (City), Herrick (Northcote), Keen (Ponsonby), Edward Fox (North Shore), Sceates (Northcote), Jackson (Northcote), A Gault (City), Jordan (Northcote), Boswell (Ponsonby), Hynes (North Shore), Stanaway (Ponsonby), Pugh (Northcote). B Team: Sergeant (Northcote), Ridings (North Shore), Schofield (Ponsonby), Conaghan (North Shore), Neil (Northcote), Gerrard (North Shore), Brown (Ponsonby), Buchanan (North Shore), Vic Barchard (City), Fairweather (Northcote), Young (North Shore), Davies (Ponsonby), McCullagh (City). Emergencies: Young (Ponsonby), Otto, Jonas, Leaity, and Tickner. The match was played in heavy rain and resulted in a 6-all draw.\nSecond Grade standings.\nThe results are incomplete. There were 10 rounds played but only 11 of the 20 results were reported.\nThird Grade standings.\nThe results are incomplete. There were 9 rounds played but only 9 results were reported out of 18 matches. Ponsonby initially entered a team in the third grade but failed to play a game before withdrawing.\nRepresentative season.\nThe season began with a match against the New Zealand team which was about to depart for its Australian tour. The touring side won by two points but when they returned from their tour they played again only this time Auckland were the victors by 11 points to 3.\nAuckland v Wellington (Northern Union Cup).\nRonald (Scotty) McDonald broke his leg during the match. Arthur Seeling of the Wellington team also badly injured his knee. The team was supposed to go by boat back to Wellington but decided to go by train so they could drop Seeling off in Whanganui where he lived. Frank Morse debuted for Auckland, as did Jim Rukutai who became the Manukau clubs first Auckland representative player.\nAuckland v Lower Waikato.\nJohn Kay had the distinction of playing for Auckland one week, and then turning out against them the following week for Waikato. Occasionally players from the Waikato and Bay of Plenty regions would represent Auckland. Kay played 3 matches for Auckland in this season. The Auckland Star credited a conversion to Jim Griffen while the New Zealand Herald reported that Charles Dunning kicked all 3 goals. As the Auckland Star's match report was more detailed that is the record reported below.\nAuckland v Nelson (Northern Union C.C.).\nFor Nelson Dave Mason scored a try, while Oscar Cederman who was later killed in action in Belgium during World War I scored a try and kicked a conversion.\nAuckland v Country (Waihi &amp; Rotorua).\nA month after Auckland's match with Hawke's Bay Māori an exhibition game was arranged in Waihi against a 'Country' team from that area, including Rotorua players. It was the first ever rugby league match played in the area and was played on the Waihi Domain in front of a \"fairly large crowd\". Despite a few regular forwards not making the trip Auckland still took a strong side and ran out winners 20-10. For the Country side Rukingi Reke kicked 2 conversions to go with a tries to F. Hall and St George."

Our experienced staff will assist you at all times.\nHistory.\nThe Abu Dhabi Equestrian Club (hereafter referred to as “ADEC”) was originally established in 1976 by the late President, His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. The club’s grass racetrack was laid down in 1980, and it opened for public racing in 1991. Prior to this, ADEC primarily organized private meetings for Arabian horses, often coinciding with significant occasions. \nIn 1994, in alignment with leadership directives, the club underwent a comprehensive modernization effort. This included the construction of a new fibreturf grass racetrack and the installation of floodlights, enabling racing events to be held after sunset. Additionally, various facilities were introduced, such as air-conditioned stable blocks and equine swimming pools. A state-of-the-art grandstand, with a seating capacity of 5,000, was constructed, featuring corporate hospitality boxes, VIP suites, and administration offices, available all season.\nDescription.\nToday, the sprawling 200-acre complex boasts a turf racetrack, sand training tracks, indoor and outdoor equestrian arenas, stables, a riding school, veterinary clinic, and a well-lit-9-hole golf course. ADEC serves a prominent venue for national and international horse racing, show jumping, and dressage competitions, including the prestigious Group 1 International Jewel Crown, with a remarkable prize of USD 1.36 million, as well as the 5* Nations Cup in show jumping. \nSeasonally, ADEC plays host to numerous horse racing events, typically running from November through March. These races deliver an electrifying and captivating experience, attracting a diverse international fan base.\nWe maintain a close collaboration with the equestrian community in the Capital, further enhancing the stature and impact of ADEC within the region."

        "text": "Billy Walker (b. 1996) is a rugby union tighthead prop, currently playing for Cambridge RFC. He has previously played for premiership team Saracens, and has U18 and U20 English international honours. \nYouth and amateur career.\nWalker's first rugby was played at local Chelmsford RFC, in their most junior youth team, the U6s, where he was coached by his father, playing with Chelmsford up to U16. He would also play for Essex county between U13 &amp; U14s. \nHe was identified for the Saracens junior academy at the age of 14, where he would do a weekly training session until the age of 16, before moving to more full time training with the senior academy. His first year of senior rugby was played with Bishop's Stortford, then in National league 2, where he praised the benefits of playing against older players and being educated in \"the tricks of the trade\".\nProfessional career.\nOn turning 19, Walker moved to play a season with Saracens' dual registration team, Bedford Blues, in the Championship. He would also play games with National League 2 team Ampthill, one of two players to act as a trial use of Ampthill as a dual-registration side.\nIn early 2016 Walker ruptured his plantar plate in his foot and was out of action for 4 months after undergoing surgery.\nIn November 2016 Walker played his 1st team Saracens debut against Newcastle Falcons, in the LV Cup, after being picked but not played the previous week against Gloucester. \nAlongside scattered 1st team games, Walker played the 2017/18 season with Old Albanians. He would also gain a Business Planning Foundation degree.\nAt the end of the 2018/19 season, Walker announced his move to Nottingham RFC, in order to guarantee regular 1st team gameplay.\nInternational career.\nWalker was selected for the England U18 team and played his debut against France before playing in all games of the 3-match tour to South Africa.\nAfter missing the U20 6 nations due to his ruptured plantar plate, he was able to return to training a month earlier than anticipated, making him eligible to be picked for the U20 world championship. He would perform successfully, including playing in the final defeating Ireland to win the tournament."

        "title": "1916 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1916 Auckland Rugby League season was the 8th year of the organisation.\nAll grades were dramatically affected by players enlisting in the war efforts. Prior to the commencement of the season it was stated in the management committee meeting that 487 players in the Auckland district alone had committed to the war effort. Teams were filled with older players and juniors. The Otahuhu senior team as was noted at their committee meeting featured “only three men eligible for military service..., and these were all registered and waiting to be called up. Of the remainder, six were married men with families, two were permanent force men, and four were under military age”.\nDespite this attendances were still good, with the mid season match between City Rovers and Grafton Athletic at Victoria Park attracting 3,000 spectators. While the Round 7 fixtures at Victoria Park drew the same number of spectators and 4,000 attending the round 8 matches. All the gate takings were donated to the Children's Hospital Ward Equipment Fund. The final round saw over 4,000 attend Victoria Park where City Rovers won the title with a 14 points to 10 win over Grafton Athletic. City also went on to win the end of season knockout Roope Rooster competition.\nOwing to the effects of the war on playing strength and out of respect for the tremendous war effort there were no representative matches played in 1916, though City Rovers did play the Lower Waikato in two exhibition fixtures (home and away), and Richmond Rovers and Thames Old Boys (based in Auckland) travelled to Thames to play a match at the season end.\n \n \nSeason news.\nEnd of season report.\nAt the end of the 1916 season a report was made on the season and it was presented to the Auckland Rugby League annual meeting in May 1917. It stated that the playing ranks had been severely depleted over the past season as over 600 players had joined the ranks of the military to fight in the first world war. There were 42 teams in total to compete across six grades (7 in the senior grade, 5 in second grade, 9 in third grade, 7 in the fourth grade, 8 in the fifth grade, and 6 in the sixth grade). Fourteen clubs were affiliated to the Auckland Rugby League with over 800 players in total. The Mangere, Remuera, and Northcote clubs withdrew from the competition due to so many of their players going to war.\nSignificantly they secured the option of the Chinamen's gardens just off Stanley Street and this was to later be turned into Carlaw Park.\nIt was suggested that the newly formed Garrison Artillery Club enter a first grade team however as there were already 6 teams competing there was a fear that it would weaken the existing teams. Otahuhu asked for Auckland Rugby League to request a special Saturday afternoon “train to be run to bring players, spectators and the general public to Otahuhu or Saturday afternoons” during the season.\nThe Junior Advisory Board was J.J. Herrick, J.J. Bolger, V.M. Sommerville, W.E. Frost, G. Wrightson, B. Davis, W.J. Davidson (Hon. Sec), T. Fielding (Chairman), T.P. Boswell, P. Henry, W.J. Alderton, O. Grubb, W. Tole, and H. Scally.\nDeath of Graham Cook and Frank McWhirter in WW1.\nGraham Cook and Frank McWhirter, who had played first grade football for Ponsonby United (Cook 1915, McWhirter 1914–15) were both killed while fighting in World War I in France. McWhirter had played representative football for Auckland against Thames and Waikato in 1915. The two had been childhood friends, both attending Ponsonby school, and then going on to work for the Auckland Gas Company. They also enlisted on the same day. Frank McWhirter was killed on July 9, 1916, at the Somme in northern France and is buried at Cite Bonjean Military Cemetery, Armentieres, France. Graham Cook was also killed at the Somme on July 11, 1916, in France. He is buried at the in Bailleul, France.\n1st Grade championship.\nThe 1st grade championship had been competing for the Myers Cup from 1910 to 1914 but after the beginning of the war the league decided to not award trophies though the grade competitions were still competed for as normal. Thirty matches were played during the season with the 20 being played at Victoria Park. The Devonport Domain hosted the 5 North Shore Albions home matches, while Otahuhu hosted 5 matches.\n1st Grade results.\nRound 3.\nThe matches were played in a strong north-easterly wind which would have been whipping across the Waitematā Harbour in the case of Victoria Park, and \"pelting rain\" but still drew \"hundreds of people\" to each venue. Both Ponsonby and Newton remained win less after 3 rounds.\nRound 4.\nNewton had trouble fielding a full team for their match with Ponsonby and ultimately played with 11, with the 28 to 3 defeat being unsurprising.\nRound 5.\nThe North Shore captain, Jack Paul converted all 7 of North Shore's tries which was a remarkable feat for this era where the conversion success rate would have been around 50%. It was said that many of them were from some distance too. Dougie McGregor played his first game of the year for Grafton, joining his brother John in the side once more. The games at the park had a sixpence charge and a crowd of 3,000 paid to get in. \nRound 6.\nThe point scoring phenomenon Karl Ifwersen was missing for Grafton and possibly as a result Newton pulled off a massive upset when they defeated Grafton by 8 points to 3. Newton had conceded 73 points and scored just 11 over their previous two matches.\nRound 8.\nOn July 15 the Observer newspaper published a collage of photographs from the July 8 games at Victoria Park. The images were of the following subjects: (1) Jack Paul, the North Shore captain; (2) James (Jimmy) Carlaw (who Carlaw Park was later named after), speaking to Dick Benson, the Auckland Rugby League secretary; (3) Jim Rukutai, the captain of City; (4) Ronald MacDonald (former New Zealand international); (5) Scrum action from the City v North Shore match; (6) Auckland Rugby League secretary; (7) A spectator; (8) James Carlaw, (9) A spectator; (10) secretary Dick Benson; (11) Caretaker of the park and constable for Freemans Bay; (12) Jack Endean.\nRound 9.\nOtahuhu despite playing at home were two men short for their match with Newton and went down 8 points to 4.\nRoope Rooster knockout competition.\nThere were 3,000 spectators in attendance at the Round 1 matches at Victoria Park. There were 3,000 in attendance again for the semi-final between City Rovers and Ponsonby United, again played at Victoria Park in muddy conditions. As the result was a draw it meant that the teams and Auckland Rugby League had to decide on how to proceed with the competition. The eventual decision was for Ponsonby to advance to the final and City Rovers to play Newton in a second semi final. City defeated Newton and then in the final they defeated Ponsonby United in front of almost 5,000 spectators.\nTop point and try scorers.\nThe following point scoring lists include both Senior Championship matches and the Roope Rooster competition. Karl Ifwersen was the top point scorer for the third consecutive year with 56 points. He also topped the try scoring list with 8.\nLower grade competitions.\nThe lower grades consisted of second, third, fourth, fifth grade, and for the first time a sixth grade. Thames Old Boys was made up of players from Thames who had settled in Auckland. The Māngere Rangers club, who only fielded a team in the second grade to start the season wrote to the league in mid June that they had ceased to be a club though they reformed a couple of years later and played until 1934. The Telegraph Messengers Club nominated a team for the fourth Grade. They were often named Post and Telegraph in the media reports during the season. In August the newly formed Riverhead club's third grade team was forced to withdraw due to so many of their players enlisting in the war effort. They wore green. Their remaining players were transferred to the City Rovers second grade side. North Shore Albions won the fifth grade competition undefeated.\nSecond grade standings.\nŌtāhuhu won the championship around the 12th of August, which was round 12. A knockout competition was played late in the season which Ponsonby won. Māngere Rangers withdrew after 2 rounds with neither of their results to that point reported. It is likely that they defaulted both matches with the standing rule that 2 consecutive defaults meant a team forfeited the right to compete thereafter, therefore they have not been included in the standings.\nThird grade standings.\nPonsonby withdrew after round 1 with their result not reported and have therefore not been included in the standings. Richmond B withdrew after 7 rounds, while Riverhead withdrew after 11 rounds after having defaulted 3 matches including 2 in a row which meant an automatic removal from competition. City Rovers won the championship however 22 results were not reported so their record would obviously have been better than Newton Ranger's. The Newton Rangers end of season function mentioned that Newton had indeed finished runners up.\nFourth grade standings (Endean Memorial Shield).\nCity won the competition when they beat Sunnyside in the final on August 26 with a 13-0 win. The Northcote A team withdrew after just 2 rounds after 0-32 and 0-36 losses to Newton, and Ponsonby respectively. City won the championship undefeated after recording wins of 42-0, 31-0, 5-3, 15-0, 20-0, 20-0, 35-0, 14-0, 11-0, and 13-0, along with a 0-0 draw with Otahuhu. Otahuhu only had two of their results reported in the entire season and it is likely that they recorded several more wins.\nFifth grade standings.\nPonsonby withdrew after 1 round with no result reported. Manukau defeated Grafton Athletic in round 9 but Grafton were awarded the match after a protest. North Shore won the championship. Their scores were reported for 9 of their 12 matches. \nSixth grade standings.\nPonsonby withdrew after 1 round with no result reported. Otahuhu withdrew after 5 rounds after 0-41, and 0-52 losses with 2 other results not reported. The City side sealed the championship after a 15-5 win over Manukau in round 10 on July 29. With 2 rounds remaining they were too far ahead to be caught.\nEnd of season exhibition matches.\nThe week after the final was played a City Rovers organised side consisting of players from City, Newton, Grafton, and North Shore traveled to Ngaruawahia to play Lower Waikato. City won by 13 points to 9. A week later Richmond and Thames Old Boys (based in Auckland) travelled to Thames to play a match. It was won by Thames Old Boys by 11 to 5. It appears that Bill Davidson, who had traveled with the sides as a Junior Board representative, played for the Thames Old Boys side and scored 2 tries and kicked a conversion.\nThe last match of the season was played on 9 September when City Rovers played against Lower Waikato at Victoria Park. City Rovers won by 19 points to 8. This brought the Auckland Rugby League season to a close. The curtain-raiser was a match between the Referees Association and Auckland rugby league players and was won by the referees by 10 points to 5.\nRepresentative fixtures.\nThere were no representative fixtures played in 1916 owing to the effects of the war on senior playing numbers."

It was created to enable athletes with Down's syndrome to compete for world titles in track and field, following the exclusion of intellectual disability categories by the International Paralympic Committee. Though learning disability events were restored at the Summer Paralympic Games, there was no category specifically for Down's syndrome – this effectively excluded the athletes, who were forced to compete against other intellectually disabled athletes who did not have the physical impairments that are typical of the condition.\nThe global competition was complemented by the regional IAADS European Athletics Championships from 2011 onwards."

        "title": "Major League Baseball on television in the 1980s",
        "text": "In 1980, 22 teams (all but the Atlanta Braves, Houston Astros, New York Mets, and St. Louis Cardinals) took part in a one-year cable deal with UA-Columbia. The deal involved the airing of a Thursday night \"Game of the Week\" in markets at least 50 miles (80 km) from a major league park. The deal earned Major League Baseball less than $500,000, but led to a new two-year contract for 40-45 games per season.\nYear-by-year breakdown.\n1980.\nABC's contract was further modified prior to the season, with the network airing just five \"Monday Night Baseball\" telecasts in June of that year, followed by \"Sunday Afternoon Baseball\" in August and September. ABC did Sunday afternoon games late in the season in order to fulfill the number of games in the contract and to not interfere with \"Monday Night Football\".\nFrom 1980 to 1981, Jim Woods and Nelson Briles (replacing Bud Harrelson) broadcast the early games on USA, while Monte Moore and Wes Parker (replacing Maury Wills) called the late game.\nAlso in 1980, ABC (with Al Michaels and Bob Uecker on the call) broadcast the National League West tie-breaker game between the Houston Astros and Los Angeles Dodgers.\nOn October 11, 1980, Keith Jackson called an Oklahoma-Texas college football game for ABC in the afternoon, then flew to Houston to call Game 4 of the NLCS). In the meantime, Don Drysdale filled-in for Jackson on play-by-play for the early innings (up until the middle of the fourth inning). Meanwhile, ABC used Steve Zabriskie as a field reporter during the 1980 NLCS.\nThe 1980 World Series is tied with the 1978 Series for having the highest overall television ratings for a World Series to date, with the six games averaging a Nielsen rating of 32.8 and a share of 56. Although Bryant Gumbel anchored NBC's pregame coverage for Game 5 of the 1980 World Series, he was not present at Royals Stadium in Kansas City. Game 5 was scheduled on a Sunday, which conflicted with Gumbel's hosting duties for the network's NFL pre-game show \"NFL '80\". As a result, Gumbel had to anchor the World Series coverage from the NBC Studios in New York City. Gumbel, however, would be present at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia for Game 6, which turned out to be the clincher for the Phillies.\n1981.\nIn , ABC planned to increase coverage to 10 Monday night games and eight Sunday afternoon games, but the players' strike that year ended up reducing the network's schedule to three Monday night and seven Sunday afternoon telecasts. Also in , as means to recoup revenue lost during a players' strike, Major League Baseball set up a special additional playoff round (as a prelude to the League Championship Series). ABC televised the American League Division Series while NBC televised the National League Division Series. The Division Series round wasn't officially instituted until 14 years later. Games 3 of the Brewers/Yankees series and Royals/Athletics series were aired regionally. On October 10, Keith Jackson called an Oklahoma-Texas college football game for ABC and missed Game 4 of the Milwaukee-New York series. In Jackson's absence, Don Drysdale filled-in for him on play-by-play alongside Howard Cosell. On a trivial note the ABC's affiliates, WTEN in Albany, New York and its satellite WCDC-TV in Adams, Massachusetts, as well as WIXT (now WSYR-TV) in Syracuse, New York, did not carry any of ABC's games at that time because of the New York Yankees games that were simulcasted from New York City's WPIX, movies, and syndicated series and specials among others in order to provide advertising for those extra money.\nDuring the 1981 players' strike, NBC used its Saturday \"Game of the Week\" time-slot to show a 20-minute strike update, followed by a sports anthology series hosted by Caitlyn Jenner (then Bruce) called \"NBC Sports: The Summer Season\".\nEven though Dick Enberg did play-by-play for the 1981 NLCS for NBC (working alongside Tom Seaver), Merle Harmon was, for the most part, NBC's backup baseball play-by-play announcer (serving behind Joe Garagiola, who called that year's ALCS for NBC with Tony Kubek) in 1981. Harmon's broadcast partner during this period was Ron Luciano. In late 1979, Harmon left the Milwaukee Brewers completely in favor of a multi-year pact with NBC. Harmon saw the NBC deal as a perfect opportunity since according to \"The Milwaukee Journal\" he would make more money, get more exposure, and do less traveling. At NBC, Harmon did \"SportsWorld\", the backup \"Game of the Week\", and served as a field reporter for the 1980 World Series. Most of all, Harmon had hoped to cover the American-boycotted 1980 Summer Olympics from Moscow. After NBC pulled out of their scheduled coverage of the 1980 Summer Olympics, Harmon considered it to be \"a great letdown.\" To add insult to injury, NBC fired Harmon in 1982 in favor of Bob Costas.\n1982.\nIn , ABC aired 11 Monday night games and one Sunday afternoon game. Game 1 of the 1982 NLCS had to be played twice. In the first attempt (on October 6), the Atlanta Braves led against the St. Louis Cardinals 1–0 behind Phil Niekro. The game was three outs away becoming official when the umpire stopped it. When the rain did not subside, the game was canceled. Game 1 began from the start the following night in a pitching match-up of Pascual Pérez for the Braves and longtime Cardinal starter Bob Forsch. Howard Cosell did not broadcast Game 2 of the 1982 NLCS (alongside Al Michaels and Tommy Lasorda) because of his commitment of hosting the Pittsburgh Steelers' 50th Anniversary dinner in Pittsburgh on October 9, 1982, which was broadcast live on Pittsburgh's ABC affiliate, WTAE-TV and Pittsburgh's NBC affiliate, WPXI-TV. ABC's Jim Lampley interviewed the winners in the Cardinals' clubhouse after clinching the National League pennant in Game 3.\nIn 1982, USA's doubleheaders did not start until June 17. Prior to the doubleheaders starting, Monte Moore and Wes Parker did the individual game until then. When the doubleheaders finally began, Moore and Parker moved over to the late game for the rest of the year. Meanwhile, Eddie Doucette (replacing Jim Woods) and Nelson Bridles were assigned to call the early game.\nUSA continued with the plan of not starting doubleheaders until June in the final year of the package in 1983. Steve Zabriskie and Al Albert filled in for Eddie Doucette in September 1982 (Steve Grad also occasionally substituted) while Albert replaced Doucette for a game or more in 1983.\nOn June 26, 1982, before the bottom of the 9th inning of NBC's \"Game of the Week\" between Boston and Milwaukee the power went out at Fenway Park. All television equipment stopped functioning except for one camera and the intercom. Luckily, the director of the telecast was Harry Coyle, who had previously guided 36 World Series broadcasts for NBC. He told the lone cameraman, Mario, “We'll show ’em what one cameraman can do!” and proceeded to direct the final inning of the game with just a single camera and zoom lens, located above home plate — including a frantic near-comeback by the Red Sox, who before the start of the inning, was down 11–8.\nAccording to his autobiography, \"Oh My\", Dick Enberg (then the lead play-by-play voice for \"The NFL on NBC\") was informed by NBC that he would become the lead play-by-play voice of the \"Major League Baseball Game of the Week\" beginning with the 1982 World Series (sharing the play-by-play duties for that game with Joe Garagiola, alongside analyst Tony Kubek) and through subsequent regular seasons. Enberg wrote that on his football trips, he would read every edition of \"The Sporting News\" to make sure he was current with all the baseball news and notes. He then met with NBC executives in September 1982, who informed him that Vin Scully was in negotiations to be their lead baseball play-by-play announcer (teaming with Garagiola, while Kubek would team with Bob Costas) and would begin with the network in the spring of 1983. Therefore, rather than throw him in randomly for one World Series, Enberg wrote that he hosted the pre-game/post-game shows while the team of Joe Garagiola and Tony Kubek did the games. According to the book, Enberg was not pleased about the decision (since he loved being the California Angels' radio voice in the 1970s and was eager to return to baseball) but the fact that NBC was bringing in Scully, arguably baseball's best announcer, was understandable. Enberg added that NBC also gave him a significant pay increase as a pseudo-apology for not coming through on the promise to make him the lead baseball play-by-play announcer.\nTom Seaver provided periodic commentary during the 1982 World Series, but was not in the booth. As previously mentioned, Dick Enberg and Joe Garagiola traded off play-by-play duties (just as Tony Kubek had done with Garagiola in NBC's previous World Series broadcasts) for NBC's coverage in 1982. Garagiola called the first three and last three innings. Enberg, meanwhile, hosted the pregame show and then called the middle innings.\n1983.\nOn April 7, 1983, Major League Baseball, ABC, and NBC agreed to terms of a six-year television package worth $1.2 billion. The two networks continued to alternate coverage of the playoffs (ABC in even numbered years and NBC in odd numbered years), World Series (ABC televised the World Series in odd numbered years and NBC in even numbered years), and All-Star Game (ABC televised the All-Star Game in even numbered years and NBC in odd numbered years) through the 1989 season, with each of the 26 clubs receiving $7 million per year in return. The last package gave each club $1.9 million per year. ABC contributed $575 million for regular season prime time and Sunday afternoons and NBC paid $550 million for thirty Saturday afternoon games. ABC was contracted to televise 20 prime time regular season games a year in addition to other games (the aforementioned Sunday afternoon games). But ABC didn't come close to using that many, which meant they actually paid for games they weren't showing. To give you some perspective, ABC televised six prime time games in 1984 and eight 1985. They planned to again televise eight prime time games in 1986.\nUSA Network's coverage became a casualty of the new $1.2 billion TV contract between Major League Baseball, ABC and NBC. One of the provisions to the new deal was that local telecasts opposite network games had to be eliminated.\n\"The New York Times\" observed the performance of the team of Vin Scully and Joe Garagiola by saying \"That the duo of Scully and Garagiola is very good, and often even great, is no longer in dispute.\" A friend of Garagiola's said \"he understood the cash\" concerning 407% hike in Major League Baseball fees paid by NBC for the 1984–89 contract. At this point the idea was basically summarized as Vin Scully \"being the star\", whereas Joe Garagiola was Pegasus or NBC's junior light. When NBC inked a six-year, $550 million contract in the fall of 1982, a return on the investment, so to speak, demanded that Vin Scully be their star baseball announcer. Scully reportedly made $2 million a year during his time with NBC in the 1980s. NBC Sports head Thomas Watson said about Scully, \"He is baseball's best announcer. Why shouldn't he be ours?\" Dick Enberg mused \"No room for me. 'Game' had enough for two teams a week.\" Henry Hecht once wrote \"NBC's Curt Gowdy, Tony Kubek, and Monte Moore sounded like college radio rejects vs. Scully.\" Vin Scully earned approximately $2 million per year for his NBC baseball broadcasting duties. Scully also reworked his Dodgers schedule during this period, as he would broadcast only home games on the radio and road games for television.\nBesides calling the Saturday \"Game of the Week\" for NBC, Scully called three World Series (1984, 1986, and 1988), four National League Championship Series (1983, 1985, 1987, and 1989), and four All-Star Games (1983, 1985, 1987, and 1989). Scully also reworked his Dodgers schedule during this period, broadcasting home games on the radio, and road games for the Dodgers television network, with Fridays and Saturdays off so he could work for NBC.\nScully was on hand for several key moments in baseball history: Fred Lynn hitting the first grand slam in All-Star Game history (1983); the 1984 Detroit Tigers winning the World Series (along the way, Scully called Tigers pitcher Jack Morris' no-hitter against the Chicago White Sox on April 7); Ozzie Smith's game-winning home run in Game 5 of the 1985 National League Championship Series; the New York Mets' miracle rally in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series; the 1987 All-Star Game in Oakland, which was deadlocked at 0–0 before Tim Raines broke up the scoreless tie with a triple in the top of the 13th inning; the first official night game in the history of Chicago's Wrigley Field (August 9, 1988); Kirk Gibson's game-winning home run in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series; and chatting with former President of the United States Ronald Reagan (who said to Scully, \"I've been out of work for six months and maybe there's a future here.\") in the booth during the 1989 All-Star Game in Anaheim as Bo Jackson hit a lead off home-run.\nWhen Tony Kubek first teamed with Bob Costas in 1983, Kubek said \"I'm not crazy about being assigned to the backup game, but it's no big ego deal.\" Costas said about working with Kubek \"I think my humor loosened Tony, and his knowledge improved me.\" The team of Costas and Kubek proved to be a formidable pair. There were even some who preferred the team of Kubek and Costas over the musings of Vin Scully and the asides of Joe Garagiola. Costas was praised by fans for both his reverence and irreverence while Kubek was praised for his technical approach and historical perspective.\nFor the 1983 season, NBC introduced a wraparound studio show (airing for about 15 minutes) co-hosted by Bill Macatee and Mike Adamle called \"30 Rock\" (a reference to the New York City skyscraper that housed NBC's headquarters). The show would offer sports news, highlights and feature reports from Len Berman. It would actually handle breaking news as well. NBC canceled the \"30 Rock\" pregame show after one year. It was also used to wraparound college basketball games, golf, and \"NBC SportsWorld\". 1983 was also the last season that the old blackout restrictions were in place. Thus, Vin Scully's first \"Game of the Week\" telecast (Montreal at Los Angeles on April 9) did not air in Los Angeles.\nOn June 6, 1983, Al Michaels officially succeeded Keith Jackson as the lead play-by-play announcer for \"Monday Night Baseball\". Michaels, who spent seven seasons working backup games, was apparently very miffed over ABC Sports' delay in announcing him as their top baseball announcer. Unlike Jackson, whose forte was college football, Michaels had gigs with the Cincinnati Reds and San Francisco Giants before joining ABC in 1976. \"TV Guide\" huffed about Jackson by saying \"A football guy, on baseball!\" Jackson was unavailable for several World Series games in and because of conflicts with his otherwise normal college football broadcasting schedule. Thus, Michaels did play-by-play for games on weekends.\nFor NBC's coverage of the 1983 All-Star Game in Chicago, Don Sutton was in New York, periodically tracking pitches with the aid of NBC's \"Inside Pitch\" technology.\n1983 marked the last time that local telecasts of League Championship Series games were allowed. In 1982, Major League Baseball recognized a problem with this due to the emergence of cable superstations such as WTBS in Atlanta and WGN-TV in Chicago. When TBS tried to petition for the right to do a \"local\" Braves broadcast of the 1982 NLCS, Major League Baseball got a Philadelphia federal court to ban them on the grounds that as a cable superstation, TBS could not have a nationwide telecast competing with ABC's.\nEarl Weaver was the #1 ABC analyst in , but was also employed by the Baltimore Orioles as a consultant. At the time, ABC had a policy preventing an announcer who was employed by a team from working games involving that team. So whenever the Orioles were on the primary ABC game, Weaver worked the backup game. This policy forced Weaver to resign from the Orioles' consulting position in October in order to be able to work the World Series for ABC.\n1984.\nOne of the most memorable broadcasts for the pair of Bob Costas and Tony Kubek was the \"Sandberg Game\" on June 23, 1984 from Chicago's Wrigley Field. In that particular game, Cubs second baseman Ryne Sandberg hit two crucial, game tying home runs off of St. Louis Cardinals closer Bruce Sutter in both the bottom of the ninth and tenth innings. The Cubs (who were at one point in the game, down 9-3) would ultimately go on to win the game in eleven innings, by the score of 12–11. Bob Costas considered the \"Game of the Week\" his dream job saying \"You can put a personal stamp on a baseball broadcast, be a reporter, something of a historian, a storyteller, conversationalist, dispenser of opinion.\"\nAs champions of the National League, the San Diego Padres had home-field advantage (at the time, the NL automatically gained home-field advantage in even years of the World Series) during the 1984 World Series. However, had the Chicago Cubs won the National League Championship Series (which appeared likely after the Cubs took a 2–0 lead in the best-of-five series), the Detroit Tigers would have gained home-field advantage despite the fact the American League's Baltimore Orioles had it the season before. NBC was contractually obligated to show all mid-week series games in prime time, something that would have been impossible at Wrigley Field, since the Cubs' venerable facility lacked lights at the time (they would not install lights until four years later). Had the Cubs advanced to the Series, Detroit would have hosted Games 1, 2, 6, and 7 (on Tuesday and Wednesday nights), while the Cubs would have hosted Games 3, 4, and 5 (on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), with all three games in Chicago starting no later than 1:30 p.m. Central Time.\nThe 1984 NLCS schedule (which had an off day after Game 3 rather than Game 2) allowed ABC to have a prime time game each weeknight even though Chicago's Wrigley Field did not have lights at the time (which remained the case until four years later). ABC used Tim McCarver as a field reporter during the 1984 NLCS. During the regular season, McCarver teamed with Don Drysdale (who teamed with Earl Weaver and Reggie Jackson for the 1984 NLCS) on backup games while Al Michaels, Jim Palmer and Earl Weaver/Howard Cosell formed ABC's number one broadcasting team. For ABC's coverage of the 1984 All-Star Game, Jim Palmer only served as a between innings analyst.\nHad the 1984 ALCS between the Detroit Tigers and Kansas City Royals gone the full five games (the last year that the League Championship Series was a best-of-five series), Game 5 on Sunday October 7, would have been a 1 p.m. ET time start instead of being in prime time. This would have happened because one of the presidential debates between Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale was scheduled for that night. In return, ABC was going to broadcast the debates instead of a baseball game in prime time. Al Trautwig interviewed the Detroit Tigers from their clubhouse following their pennant clinching victory in Game 3.\n1985.\nOn Thursday, October 10, 1985, NBC didn't come on the air for Game 2 of the NLCS until 8:30 p.m. ET to avoid disrupting \"The Cosby Show\" at 8 (similarly to how the network aired the soap opera \"Return to Peyton Place,\" before Game 5 of the 1972 World Series, rather than a pre-game show). NBC would do the same thing for Thursday night games in subsequent postseasons. Dick Enberg hosted the 1985 NLCS with Joe Morgan. It was Enberg who broke the news to most of the nation that Vince Coleman had been injured before Game 4. NBC even aired an interview with one of the few people who actually saw the incident, a Dodger batboy.\nDick Enberg was also at Exhibition Stadium in Toronto for Games 1 and 7 of the 1985 ALCS on NBC. Enberg hosted the alongside Rick Dempsey (who was still active with Baltimore at the time). Meanwhile, Bill Macatee provided a report on Game 2 of the ALCS during the pregame of the NLCS opener.\nIn 1985, ABC announced that every game of the World Series would be played under the lights for the biggest baseball audience possible. Just prior to the start of the 1985 World Series, ABC removed Howard Cosell from scheduled announcing duties as punishment for his controversial book \"I Never Played the Game\". In Cosell's place came Tim McCarver (joining play-by-play man Michaels and fellow color commentator Jim Palmer), who was beginning his trek of being a part of numerous World Series telecasts. Reportedly, by , Cosell was considered to be difficult to work with on baseball telecasts. Apparently, Cosell and Michaels got into a fairly heated argument following the conclusion of their coverage of the 1984 American League Championship Series due to Cosell's supposed drunkenness among other problems. Rumor has it that Michaels went as far as to urged ABC executives to remove Cosell from the booth. Ultimately, Michaels went public with his problems with Cosell. Michaels claimed that \"Howard had become a cruel, evil, vicious person.\"\n1986.\nBy , ABC only televised 13 \"Monday Night Baseball\" games. This was a fairly sharp contrast to the 18 games to that were scheduled in . \"The Sporting News\" believed that ABC paid Major League Baseball to not make them televise the regular season. \"TSN\" added that the network only wanted the sport for October anyway. Going into , ABC had reportedly purchased 20 Monday night games but only used eight of those slots. More to the point, CBS Sports president Neal Pilson said \"Three years ago, we believed ABC's package was overpriced by $175 million. We still believe it's overpriced by $175 million.\"\nDuring the 1986 season, Don Drysdale did play-by-play ABC's Sunday afternoon games, which aired until July, when \"Monday Night Baseball\" began. Al Michaels did the main Sunday game usually with Jim Palmer, while Drysdale and Johnny Bench did the backup contests. Keith Jackson, usually working with Tim McCarver did the #2 Monday night games. Bench took a week off in June (with Steve Busby filling in), and also worked one game with Michaels as the networks switched the announcer pairings. While Drysdale worked the All-Star Game in Houston as an interviewer he did not resurface until the playoffs. Bench simply disappeared, ultimately going to CBS Radio.\nOn October 15, 1986, Game 6 of the NLCS ran so long (lasting for 16 innings, 5 hours and 29 minutes), it bumped up against the start time of Game 7 of the ALCS (also on ABC). During Game 6 of the NLCS, color commentator Tim McCarver left the booth during the bottom of the 16th, in order to cover the expected celebration in the New York Mets' clubhouse. As a result, play-by-play man Keith Jackson was on the air by himself for a short time. Eventually, McCarver rejoined the broadcast just before the end of the game, watching the action on a monitor in the Mets' clubhouse, then doing the postgame interviews with the Mets. Meanwhile, Corey McPherrin, a sports anchor with WABC (ABC's flagship station out of New York) interviewed Mike Scott when he was presented with the 1986 NLCS MVP award after Game 6. During the late 1980s, McPherrin delivered in-game updates during ABC's \"Monday Night Baseball\" and \"Thursday Night Baseball\" broadcasts. In his last ever ABC assignment, Don Drysdale interviewed the winners in the Boston clubhouse following Game 7 of the 1986 ALCS.\nVin Scully's call of the final play in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series on NBC television would quickly become an iconic one to baseball fans, with the normally calm Scully growing increasingly excited: \"So the winning run is at second base, with two outs, three and two to Mookie Wilson. [A] little roller up along first... behind the bag! It gets through Buckner! Here comes Knight, and the Mets win it!\" Scully then remained silent for more than three minutes, letting the pictures and the crowd noise tell the story. Scully resumed with \"If one picture is worth a thousand words, you have seen about a million words, but more than that, you have seen an absolutely bizarre finish to Game 6 of the 1986 World Series. The Mets are not only alive, they are well; and they will play the Red Sox in Game 7 tomorrow!\" Game 6 caused the first preemption of \"Saturday Night Live\", due to extra innings. The preempted episode would air two weeks later on November 8, with an introduction by Ron Darling, who explained that when the Mets entered the locker room, they were informed that they caused the first delay in \"SNL\"s 11-year history (at the time) to their dismay.\nNBC's broadcast of Game 7 of the 1986 World Series (which went up against a \"Monday Night Football\" game between the Washington Redskins and New York Giants on ABC) garnered a Nielsen rating of 38.9 and a 55 share, making it the highest-rated single World Series game to date. Game 7 had been scheduled for Sunday, but a rain-out forced the game to Monday. NBC's telecast of the Series ended with the song \"Limelight\" from \"Stereotomy\", penultimate album of The Alan Parsons Project.\n1987.\nNBC used Don Sutton as a pre- and post-game analyst for their 1987 LCS coverage. Sutton also made an appearance in the booth during Game 3 of the ALCS. Sutton talked with Bob Costas and Tony Kubek about Twins pitcher Les Straker's borderline balk in that game. Sutton later interviewed Detroit Tigers manager Sparky Anderson following their loss in Game 5. Meanwhile, Marv Albert went back-and-forth during both 1987 LCS. He hosted the pregame for Game 1 of the NLCS with Joe Morgan, and in fact had to read the lineups to the viewing audience. There was a problem with the P.A. feed at Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis, so he ended up reading the script from the Cardinal dugout while the players were introduced to the crowd. He then went to Minneapolis the next night to host the ALCS pregame with Don Sutton at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. Jimmy Cefalo hosted the pregame coverage for Game 5 of the NLCS, as Marv Albert was away on a boxing assignment for NBC.\nJay Randolph, who was also the sports director for St. Louis NBC affiliate KSDK, interviewed the winners in the St. Louis Cardinals' clubhouse following their Game 7 victory. Also following Game 7, NBC's Marv Albert interviewed 1987 NLCS MVP, Jeffrey Leonard of the San Francisco Giants (to date, the last person from the losing team to win a postseason series Most Valuable Player Award, either League Championship Series or World Series).\nFor the 1987 World Series between the Minnesota Twins and St. Louis Cardinals, ABC utilized 12 cameras and nine tape machines. This includes cameras positioned down the left field line, on the roof of the Metrodome, and high above third base. There have been a few occasions when two \"Monday Night Football\" games were played simultaneously. In 1987, a scheduling conflict arose when Major League Baseball's Minnesota Twins went to Game 7 of the World Series (which also aired on ABC), making the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome unavailable for the Minnesota Vikings' scheduled game (against the Denver Broncos) that Sunday.\nAlthough Al Michaels, Jim Palmer and Tim McCarver had done the 1985 and 1987 World Series together as well as the 1986 All-Star Game, ABC did not team them on a regular basis on \"Monday Night Baseball\" until (after three 'experiments' in ).\n1988.\nDuring the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike, networks benefited from sports programming, including NBC, which relied on the Summer Olympics in September and the World Series in October, and ABC, which in addition to its postseason baseball coverage, moved up the start time for the early weeks of \"Monday Night Football\" (when Al Michaels was unavailable to do play-by-play on \"Monday Night Football\", which he had done for ABC beginning in 1986 due to his postseason baseball duties, Frank Gifford covered for him) from 9 p.m. ET to 8 p.m. ET (\"MacGyver\", which normally aired at 8 p.m., was not yet ready with new episodes).\nABC's coverage of Game 2 of the 1988 NLCS didn't start until 10 p.m. ET due to a presidential debate. This is the latest ever scheduled start for an LCS game.\nGary Bender did play-by-play for the 1988 American League Championship Series between the Oakland Athletics and Boston Red Sox. Bender spent two years (1987-1988) as the #2 baseball play-by-play man for ABC behind Al Michaels. Bender worked the backup \"Monday Night Baseball\" broadcasts (with Tim McCarver in 1987 and Joe Morgan in 1988) as well as serving as a field reporter for ABC's 1987 World Series coverage. After Bender spent an entire summer developing a team with Joe Morgan, ABC brought in Reggie Jackson to work with the duo for the 1988 ALCS. According to Bender's autobiography \"Call of the Game\" (pages 118-120), ABC's decision to bring in Jackson to work with Bender and Morgan caused problems: \nDuring the spare time of his active career, Reggie Jackson worked as a field reporter and color commentator for ABC Sports. During the 1980s (1983, 1985, and 1987 respectively), Jackson was given the task of presiding over the World Series Trophy presentations.\nAs previously mentioned, longtime Los Angeles Dodgers' broadcaster Vin Scully called the 1988 World Series for a national television audience on NBC with Joe Garagiola. Unknown to the fans and the media at the time, Kirk Gibson was watching the game on television while undergoing physical therapy in the Dodgers' clubhouse. At some point during the game, television cameras scanned the Dodgers dugout and Scully, observed that Gibson was nowhere to be found. This spurred Gibson to tell Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda that he was available to pinch hit. Gibson immediately returned to the batting cage in the clubhouse to take practice swings. Bob Costas, who, along with Marv Albert, hosted NBC's World Series pre-game coverage and handled post-game interviews, made on-air statements that enraged many in the Dodgers' clubhouse (especially Tommy Lasorda). After the Dodgers won Game 4, Lasorda (during a post-game interview with Marv Albert) sarcastically said that the MVP of the World Series should be Bob Costas. While Kirk Gibson was taking practice swings in the Dodgers' clubhouse during Game 1, Orel Hershiser set up the hitting tee for his teammate. Along the way, Costas could hear Gibson's agonized-sounding grunts after every hit. Costas said that the 1988 Dodgers possibly had the weakest hitting line-up in World Series history.\nThe following is Vin Scully's call of Kirk Gibson's game inning home run in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series of the 1988 World Series: \"All year long, they looked to him to light the fire, [Scully began] and all year long, he answered the demands, until he was physically unable to start tonight – with two bad legs: The bad left hamstring, and the swollen right knee. And, with two out, you talk about a roll of the dice... this is it.\" Scully made repeated references to Gibson's legs, noting at one point that the batter was \"shaking his left leg, making it quiver, like a horse trying to get rid of a troublesome fly.\" Gibson worked the count to 3–2 as Mike Davis stole second base; the camera turned at that point to Steve Sax getting ready for his turn at the plate, and Scully reminded the viewers that Sax was waiting on deck, but that the game right now is at the plate. \"High fly ball into right field, she i-i-i-is... gone!!\" Scully said nothing for over a minute, allowing the pictures to tell the story. Finally, he said, \"In a year that has been so improbable... the impossible has happened!\" Returning to the subject of Gibson's banged-up legs during a replay, Scully joked, \"And, now, the only question was, could he make it around the base paths unassisted?!\" \"You know, I said it once before, a few days ago, that Kirk Gibson was not the Most Valuable Player; that the Most Valuable Player for the Dodgers was Tinkerbell. But, tonight, I think Tinkerbell backed off for Kirk Gibson. And, look at Eckersley – shocked to his toes!\" \"They are going wild at Dodger Stadium – no one wants to leave!\" As NBC showed a replay of Gibson rounding second base in his home run trot, Scully then made a point to note Eckersley's pitching performance throughout the 1988 season, to put things in perspective. \"Dennis Eckersley allowed five home runs all year. And we'll be back.\"\nThe 1988 World Series marked the last time that NBC would televise a World Series for seven years. Beginning in , NBC would be shut out of Major League Baseball coverage completely, after CBS signed a four-year, exclusive television contract. After splitting coverage of the 1995 World Series with ABC, NBC would next cover a World Series exclusively in 1997.\n1989.\nIn (the final year of ABC's contract with Major League Baseball), ABC moved the baseball telecasts to Thursday nights in hopes of getting leg up against NBC's \"Cosby Show\". After braving the traumatic Loma Prieta earthquake and an all-time low 16.4 rating for the 1989 World Series,\nAs previously mentioned former President of the United States, Ronald Reagan (who had just left office) served as the color commentator instead of Tom Seaver (Vin Scully's normal NBC broadcasting partner at the time) for the first inning of the 1989 All-Star Game from Anaheim. Bo Jackson became a popular figure for his athleticism in multiple sports through the late 1980s and early 1990s. He served as a spokesman for Nike and was involved in a popular ad campaign called \"Bo Knows\" which envisioned Jackson attempting to take up a litany of other sports, including tennis, golf, luge, auto racing, and even playing blues music with Bo Diddley, who scolded Jackson by telling him, \"You don't know diddley!\" (in a later version of the spot, Jackson is shown playing the guitar expertly, after which an impressed Diddley says, \"Bo...you \"do\" know Diddley, don't you?\") Serendipitously, the original spot first aired during the commercial break immediately following Jackson's lead-off home run in the 1989 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (as Vin Scully exclaimed, \"Look at that one! Bo Jackson says hello!\").\nOn Saturday, June 3, 1989, Vin Scully was doing the play-by-play for the NBC \"Game of the Week\" in St. Louis, where the Cardinals beat the Chicago Cubs in 10 innings. Meanwhile, the Dodgers were playing a series in Houston, where Scully flew to be on hand to call the Sunday game of the series. However, the Saturday night game between the teams was going into extra innings when Scully arrived in town, so he went to the Astrodome instead of his hotel. He picked up the play-by-play, helping to relieve the other Dodger announcers, who were doing both television and radio, and broadcast the final 13 innings (after already calling 10 innings in St. Louis), as the game went 22 innings. He broadcast 23 innings in one day in two different cities.\nCTV would simulcast NBC \"Game of the Week\" telecasts of Toronto Blue Jays games, such as NBC's final \"Game of the Week\" telecast on September 30, 1989, where the Blue Jays clinched the American League East against the Baltimore Orioles. Meanwhile, in the latter part of his career, National League umpire Doug Harvey became known for appearing in the \"You Make the Call\" segments on NBC's \"Game of the Week\" telecasts.\nThen Texas Rangers manager Bobby Valentine worked as an on-the-field analyst for NBC's 1989 ALCS coverage. Likewise, recently retired Philadelphia Phillies legend Mike Schmidt did the same for the NLCS.\nVin Scully was unable to call Game 2 of the 1989 National League Championship Series (on Wednesday, October 4) because he was suffering from laryngitis. As a result, secondary play-by-play announcer Bob Costas filled in for him. Around the same time, Costas was assigned to call the American League Championship Series between Oakland and Toronto. Game 2 of the NLCS occurred on Thursday, October 5, which was an off day for the ALCS. NBC then decided to fly Costas from Toronto to Chicago to substitute for Scully on Thursday night. Afterwards, Costas flew back to Toronto, where he resumed work on the ALCS the next night.\nJimmy Cefalo hosted the pregame show for Game 4 of the 1989 ALCS as Marv Albert was away on an NFL assignment for NBC.\nAs previously mentioned, Game 3 of the 1989 World Series (initially scheduled for October 17) was delayed by ten days due to the Loma Prieta earthquake. The earthquake struck at approximately 5:04 p.m. Pacific Time. At the moment the quake struck, ABC's color commentator Tim McCarver was narrating taped highlights of the previous Series game. Viewers saw the video signal begin to break up, heard McCarver repeat a sentence as the shaking distracted him, and heard McCarver's colleague Al Michaels exclaim, \"I'll tell you what, we're having an earth—.\" At that moment, the feed from Candlestick Park was lost. The network put up a green ABC Sports graphic as the audio was switched to a telephone link. Michaels had to pickup a POTS phone in the press booth (phones work off a separate power supply) and call ABC headquarters in New York, at which point they put him back on the air. Michaels cracked, \"Well folks, that's the greatest open in the history of television, bar none!\" accompanied by the excited screams of fans who had no idea of the devastation elsewhere.\nAfter about a 15-minute delay (ABC aired a rerun of \"Roseanne\" and subsequently, \"The Wonder Years\" in the meantime), ABC was able to regain power via a backup generator. ABC's play-by-play man, Al Michaels (who was familiar with the San Francisco Bay Area dating back to his days working for the San Francisco Giants from 1974-1976) then proceeded to relay reports to Ted Koppel at ABC News' headquarters in Washington, D.C. Al Michaels was ultimately nominated for an Emmy for his on-site reporting at the World Series.\nThe Goodyear blimp was aloft above the ballpark to provide aerial coverage of the World Series. Blimp pilot John Crayton reported that he felt four bumps during the quake. ABC was able to use the blimp to capture some of the first images of the damage to the Bay Bridge.\nThe end of the ABC-NBC pact.\nAfter calling the 1988 World Series with Vin Scully, Joe Garagiola resigned from NBC Sports. Although it was not official at the time, NBC was on the verge of losing the television rights to cover Major League Baseball to CBS. Garagiola claimed that NBC left him \"twisting\" while he was trying to renegotiate his deal. Joe Garagiola was replaced by Tom Seaver for the 1989 season.\nAl Michaels took ABC's loss of baseball to CBS as \"tough to accept.\"Michaels added that \"baseball was such an early stepchild at ABC and had come such a long way.\" Gary Thorne, who served as ABC's backup play-by-play announcer in 1989 and was an on-field reporter for the World Series that year (and covering the trophy presentation in the process), simply laughed while saying \"Great reviews, just as ABC baseball ends.\" After ABC lost the Major League Baseball package to CBS, they aggressively counterprogrammed CBS' postseason baseball coverage with made-for-TV movies and miniseries geared towards female viewers.\nNBC's final Major League Baseball broadcast was televised on October 9, 1989; Game 5 of the National League Championship Series between the San Francisco Giants and Chicago Cubs from Candlestick Park. Vin Scully said \"It's a passing of a great American tradition. It is sad. I really and truly feel that. It will leave a vast window, to use a Washington word, where people will not get Major League Baseball and I think that's a tragedy. It's a staple that's gone. I feel for people who come to me and say how they miss it, and I hope me.\"\nBob Costas said that he would rather do a \"Game of the Week\" that got a 5 rating than host a Super Bowl. \"Who thought baseball killed its best way to reach the public? It coulda kept us and CBS – we'd have kept the 'Game' – but it only cared about cash. Whatever else I did, I'd never have left 'Game of the Week' Costas claimed. Tony Kubek, who (as previously mentioned) teamed with Bob Costas since 1983, said \"I can't believe it!\" when the subject came about NBC losing baseball for the first time since 1947.\nAuthor and presidential speechwriter Curt Smith went a step further in saying that Major League Baseball's deal with CBS Sports was \"sportscasting's Exxon Valdez.\" Had baseball valued national promotion provided by the \"Game of the Week\", said Smith, it never would have crafted a fast-bucks plan that has cut off the widest viewership. \"It's an obscene imbalance\", Smith also said, \"to have 175 games going to 60 percent of the country [in reference to Major League Baseball's corresponding cable television deal with ESPN, which at the time was only available in about 60% of the country] and 16 games going to the rest.\" He added: \"Baseball has paid a grievous price for being out of sight and out of mind. It's attacked the lower and middle classes that forms baseball's heart. ... In the end, the advertising community has come to view baseball as a leper.\"\nOne possible key factor towards why NBC lost the baseball package to CBS was due to their commitment to broadcasting the 1992 Summer Olympics from Barcelona.\nAfter NBC lost the Major League Baseball package to CBS, the network aggressively counterprogrammed CBS's postseason baseball coverage with made-for-TV movies and miniseries geared towards female viewers."

        "text": "In 1950 the Mutual Broadcasting System acquired the television and radio broadcast rights to the World Series and All-Star Game for the next six years. Mutual may have been reindulging in dreams of becoming a television network or simply taking advantage of a long-standing business relationship; in either case, the broadcast rights were sold to NBC in time for the following season's games at an enormous profit.\nYear-by-year breakdown.\n1950.\nOn July 11, 1950 the All-Star Game out of Chicago's Comiskey Park was televised for the first time. On November 8, 1950, Commissioner Happy Chandler and player reps agreed on the split of the TV-radio rights from the World Series.\nBy World Series games could be seen in most of the country, but not all. 1950 also marked the first time that there was an exclusive network television broadcaster (NBC). West Coast viewers finally saw live major league games on television during the 1951 postseason.\n1951.\nOn August 11, 1951 WCBS-TV in New York City televised the first baseball game (in which the Boston Braves beat the Brooklyn Dodgers by the score of 8–4) in color. On October 1 of that year, NBC aired the first coast-to-coast baseball telecast as the Brooklyn Dodgers were beaten by the New York Giants in the first game of a playoff series by the score of 3–1 featuring Bobby Thomson's two-run home run. Thomson's famous now-legendary home run would occur in the third game of the best of 3 series.\nNBC aired the second and third games of the 1951 National League tie-breaker series between the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants, necessitated by the teams' finishing the regular season in a tie for first place. The three-game pennant playoff, which featured the first baseball games televised live from coast to coast (with CBS airing the first game), culminated on October 3 when the Giants won the third and deciding game by the score of 5–4 (off Bobby Thomson's home run). Ernie Harwell called the game for Giants television flagship WPIX – the independent station's broadcast was simulcast nationally by NBC – and his description of the home run was a simple shout of \"It's gone!\" almost at the moment Thomson's bat struck Ralph Branca's pitch. Harwell later admitted he had probably called it \"too soon\", but fortunately for him, the call proved to be correct. \"And then\", Harwell recalled, \"the pictures took over.\"\nThe 1951 playoff between Brooklyn and the New York Giants and that year's World Series were the first major league baseball games telecast live from coast-to-coast to coast; transcontinental network transmission lines had been completed and activated in September, in-time for the Japanese Peace Treaty Conference in San Francisco and the start of the 1951–52 television season.\n1952.\nThe 1952 All-Star Game at Shibe Park in Philadelphia was the first nationally televised All-Star Game, but it was shortened due to rain.\n1953.\nOn January 31, 1953 the New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians and Boston Red Sox joined forces against St. Louis Browns owner Bill Veeck. The respective franchises tried to force the Browns to play afternoon games in an attempt to avoid having to share television revenues. A month later, Major League Baseball owners received a warning from Senator Edwin Johnson about nationally televising their games. Johnson's theory was that nationally televising baseball games would be a threat to the survival of minor league baseball. The owners pretty much ignored Johnson since the games on NBC in particular, were gaining a large and loyal following.\nIn 1953 ABC-TV executive Edgar J. Scherick (who later created \"Wide World of Sports\") broached a Saturday \"Game of the Week\", TV sport's first network series. At the time, ABC was labeled a \"nothing network\" that had fewer outlets than CBS or NBC. ABC also needed paid programming or \"anything for bills\" as Scherick put it. At first, ABC hesitated at the idea of a nationally televised regular season baseball program. ABC wondered how exactly the \"Game of the Week\" would reach television in the first place and who would notice if it did? Also, Major League Baseball barred the \"Game of the Week\" from airing within 50 miles of any ballpark. Major League Baseball according to Scherick, insisted on protecting local coverage and didn't care about national appeal. ABC, though, did care about the national appeal and claimed that \"most of America was still up for grabs.\"\nIn April 1953 Edgar Scherick set out to sell teams rights but instead, only got the Philadelphia Athletics, Cleveland Indians, and Chicago White Sox to sign on. These were not \"national\" broadcast contracts since they were assembled through negotiations with individual teams to telecast games from their home parks. It was until the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, that antitrust laws barred \"pooled rights\" TV contracts negotiated with a central league broadcasting authority.\nIn 1953 ABC earned an 11.4 rating for their \"Game of the Week\" telecasts. Blacked-out cities had 32% of households. In the rest of the United States, 3 in 4 TV sets in use watched Dizzy Dean and Buddy Blattner (or backup announcers Bill McColgan and Bob Finnegan) call the games for ABC. CBS took over the Saturday \"Game\" in 1955 (the rights were actually set up through the Falstaff Brewing Corporation) retaining Dean/Blattner and McColgan/Finnegan as the announcing crews (as well as Gene Kirby, who produced the Dean/Blattner games and alternated with them on play-by-play) and adding Sunday coverage in 1957. As Edgar Scherick said, \"In '53, no one wanted us. Now teams begged for \"Game\"'s cash.\"\n1955.\nBy 1955 Dizzy Dean and the \"Game of the Week\" would move from ABC to CBS (the rights were actually set up through the Falstaff Brewing Corporation). \"CBS' stakes were higher\" said Buddy Blattner, who left the Mutual Broadcasting System to rejoin Dean. Ron Powers wrote about the reteaming of Dean and Blattner, \"they wanted someone who'd known Diz, could bring him out.\" Gene Kirby, who had worked with Dean and Blattner at Mutual and ABC, produced the telecasts and also filled in on announcing duties.\nBob Finnegan, who along with Bill McColgan had called backup games for ABC, performed the same role for CBS, working with a variety of color men including future \"Wide World of Sports\" host Jim McKay and future \"World News Tonight\" anchor Frank Reynolds.\nAnother first for NBC during this period was the first color telecast of a World Series, the 1955 matchup between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Yankees.\n1956.\nIn 1956 CBS Sports director Frank Chirkinian devised an earplug called an Intercepted Feed Back (or IFB) to connect the announcer, director, producer and thus, smoothing on-air flow.\n1957.\nIn 1957 NBC started airing weekend \"Game of the Week\" telecasts (Sunday telecasts were added in 1959) with Lindsey Nelson and Leo Durocher calling the action. During this period, NBC (as rival CBS had the rights to broadcast at least eight teams) typically broadcast from Pittsburgh's Forbes Field, Chicago's Wrigley Field or Milwaukee's County Stadium. NBC purchased the rights to 11 Milwaukee Braves games, 11 Pittsburgh Pirates games, two Washington Senators games, and two Chicago Cubs games. Leo Durocher was succeeded as color commentator by Fred Haney in 1960, and Joe Garagiola in 1961, while Bob Wolff replaced Nelson on play-by-play in 1962.\nAlso in 1957 CBS added a Sunday \"Game of the Week\". ABC's Edgar Scherick said \"In '53, no one wanted us. Now teams begged for \"Game\"'s cash.\" That year, the National Football League (NFL) began a US$14.1 million revenue-sharing pact. By 1965, Major League Baseball ended the large-market blackout, got $6.5 million for exclusivity, and split the pot.\nWith CBS now carrying the \"Game of the Week\", the network's stations in Phoenix (KOOL-TV), Little Rock (KTHV) and Cedar Rapids (KGAN-TV) were finally receiving the broadcasts. Bud Blattner said \"America had never had TV network ball. Now you're getting two games a week [four, counting NBC, by ].\"\n1958.\nIn 1958 Dizzy Dean ruffled the feathers of CBS Sports head Bill MacPhail when he said \"I don't know how we come off callin' this the 'Game of the Week'. There's a much better game – Dodgers–Giants – over on NBC.\" Dean also once refused a Falstaff ad because the date was Mother's Day. When United Airlines backed CBS' \"Game of the Week\" telecasts, Dean – who hated to fly – said \"If you have to, pod-nuh, Eastern is much the best.\" That year, George Kell served as host for the pregame show. During one broadcast, Kell hoped to ask guest Casey Stengel about the Yankees' batting order. When asked about how it went, Kell said, \"Fine. But in our 15 minutes, Casey didn't get past the leadoff batter.\"\nFrom 1958 to 1960, NBC aired a special regional feed of its games in the southeast, where the network had a different sponsor (such as National Bohemian beer) than for the rest of the country. This feed featured its own announcing team, with Chuck Thompson calling the games with Bill Veeck (1958) and Al Rosen (1959–60). NBC never had a true backup game until 1966, when the network got exclusivity for the \"Game of the Week\". In the process, NBC brought in Curt Gowdy and Pee Wee Reese for the primary game, and Jim Simpson and Tony Kubek for the alternate game (which was always shown in the markets of teams playing in the primary game).\nKTTV in Los Angeles aired the first regular-season baseball game ever played on the West Coast, a Los Angeles Dodgers-San Francisco Giants game from Seals Stadium in San Francisco, California, with Vin Scully announcing. In its first year airing Major League Baseball, KTTV aired only the Dodgers' road games.\n1959.\nJack Whitaker and Frankie Frisch announced the backup games on CBS from 1959 to 1961. They usually did games that took place in Philadelphia, New York City, Washington, D.C. or Baltimore. Whitaker once said in three years, he would only broadcast three innings because CBS would not switch away from Dizzy Dean. However, he said that he learned a lot of baseball just sitting next to Frisch. CBS had other backup crews for games featuring the Chicago Cubs and White Sox, Cleveland Indians and Cincinnati Reds. In these cases, Bob Finnegan would handle the play-by-play duties with various analysts depending on the city. CBS did not have \"Game of the Week\" rights from any other ballparks in those years.\nWhat may be the first sports instant replay using videotape occurred on July 17, 1959, during a broadcast of a New York Yankees game by New York TV station WPIX. It came after a hit by Jim McAnany of the Chicago White Sox ended a no-hitter by the Yankees' Ralph Terry. Since the game was being videotaped, broadcaster Mel Allen asked director Terry Murphy to play a tape of McAnany's hit over the air.\nIn 1959 ABC broadcast the best-of-three playoff series (to decide the National League pennant) between the Milwaukee Braves and Los Angeles Dodgers. The cigarette company L&amp;M was in charge of all of the telecasts. George Kell and Bob DeLaney were the announcers.\nChicago White Sox announcer Bob Elson missed a chance to call the 1959 World Series – the White Sox' first since 1919, and Elson's first since 1943 – on NBC because the then head of NBC Sports, Tom Gallery (who incidentally, grew up on the same block as Elson) did not like him. Elson was, however, allowed to call the Series on the White Sox' radio flagship, WCFL."

Jack Buck and Carl Erskine were the lead announcing crew for this series, which lasted one season. ABC typically did three games a week. Two of the games were always from the Eastern or Central Time Zone. The late games (no doubleheaders) were usually San Francisco Giants or Los Angeles Dodgers' home games. However, the Milwaukee Braves used to start many of their Saturday home games late in the afternoon. So if the Giants and Dodgers were both the road at the same time, ABC still would be able to show a late game.\nYear-by-year breakdown.\n1960.\nIn 1957, NBC started airing weekend \"Game of the Week\" telecasts (Sunday telecasts were added in 1959) with Lindsey Nelson and Leo Durocher calling the action.

CBS did not have \"Game of the Week\" rights from any other ballparks in those years.\nPee Wee Reese replaced Blattner as Dean's partner in . That year, Jerry Coleman hosted the pregame show for CBS' \"Game of the Week\" broadcasts. A rather embarrassing incident for Coleman occurred when he was interviewing Cookie Lavagetto when the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" started. Coleman later said, \"Believe me, when the Anthem starts, I stop, whether I'm taping, talking, or eating a banana.\"\n1961.\nOne other note about ABC baseball coverage during this period. Despite temporarily losing the \"Game of the Week\" package in 1961, ABC still televised several games in prime time (with Jack Buck returning to call the action). This occurred as Roger Maris was poised to tie and subsequently break Babe Ruth's regular season home run record of 60. As with all Major League Baseball games in those days, the action was totally blacked out of major league markets. As a matter of fact, as documented in the HBO film \"61*\", the Maris family was welcomed into ABC's Kansas City, Missouri affiliate KMBC-TV so they could watch the in-house feed of the game, which was blacked out of Kansas City.\n1962.\nIn 1962, CBS dropped the Sunday baseball \"Game of the Week\" once the NFL season started, dropping the option clause for affiliates to carry baseball or football in place since 1957.\n1963.\nIn 1963 and 1964, viewers in San Francisco were unable to see certain baseball telecasts aired by CBS on KPIX-TV locally, although the games aired on stations in markets adjacent to the Bay Area. In 1963, KPIX pre-empted the July 13 game between the San Francisco Giants–Philadelphia Phillies (at 10:15 a.m.), and the Los Angeles Dodgers-Phillies game on July 14 (at 9:30 a.m.); in 1964, the station pre-empted the Kansas City Athletics–New York Yankees game on May 16 (at 10:45) and the Milwaukee Braves–St. Louis Cardinals game on May 17. All four games did air on NBC affiliate KSBW in Salinas, KXTV in Sacramento and ABC affiliate KHSL-TV in Chico (the games also aired on KOLO-TV in Reno, Nevada, however it joined the two July 1963 games in progress, at 10:25 and 9:55 a.m. on the respective dates).\n1964.\nBy , CBS' Dean and Reese called games from Yankee Stadium, Wrigley Field, St. Louis, Philadelphia and Baltimore. The New York Yankees got a $550,000 share of CBS' $895,000. Six clubs that exclusively played nationally televised games on NBC were paid $1.2 million. The theme music used on the CBS telecasts during this era was a Dixieland styled rendition of \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\".\nOn July 17, , a game out of Los Angeles between the Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers contest became the first Pay TV baseball game. Subscription television offered the \"cablecast\" to subscribers for money. (The Dodgers beat the Cubs by the score of 3–2, with Don Drysdale collecting 10 strikeouts.)\n1965.\nIn , ABC provided the first-ever nationwide baseball coverage with weekly Saturday broadcasts on a regional basis. ABC paid $5.7 million for the rights to the 28 Saturday/holiday \"Games of the Week\". ABC's deal covered all of the teams except the New York Yankees and Philadelphia Phillies (who had their own television deals) and called for two regionalized games on Saturdays, Independence Day, and Labor Day. Each Saturday, ABC broadcast two 2 p.m. games and one 5 p.m. game for the Pacific Time Zone. ABC blacked out the games in the home cities of the clubs playing those games. Major League Baseball however, had a TV deal with NBC for the All-Star Game and World Series. At the end of the season, ABC declined to exercise its $6.5 million option for , citing poor ratings, especially in New York.\nAccording to ABC announcer Merle Harmon's profile in Curt Smith's book \"Voices of Summer\", in , CBS' \"Yankee Game of the Week\" beat ABC in the ratings in at least Dallas and Des Moines. To make matters worse, local television split the big-city audience. Therefore, ABC could show the Cubs vs. the Cardinals in the New York market, yet the Mets would still kill them in terms of viewership. Harmon, Chris Schenkel, Keith Jackson, and (on occasion) Ken Coleman served as ABC's principal play-by-play voices for this series. Also on the network's announcing team were pregame host Howard Cosell and color commentators Leo Durocher, Tommy Henrich, Warren Spahn (who worked with Chris Schenkel on a July 17 Baltimore-Detroit contest), and Hall of Fame Brooklyn Dodger great Jackie Robinson (who, on April 17, 1965, became the first black network broadcaster for Major League Baseball). According to ABC Sports producer Chuck Howard, \"(Robinson) had a high, stabbing voice, great presence, and sharp mind. All he lacked was time.\"\n1966.\nThe New York Yankees, which, the year before, had played 21 \"Games of the Week\" for CBS, joined NBC's package in 1966. The new package under NBC called for 28 games, as compared to the 123 combined among three networks during the 1960s. On October 19, 1966, NBC signed a three-year contract with Major League Baseball. As previously mentioned, the year before, Major League Baseball sold an exclusive league-wide television package for the rights to the Saturday-Sunday \"Game of the Week\" to ABC. NBC covered only the All-Star Game and World Series in 1965. In addition, a previous deal limited CBS to covering only twelve weekends when its new subsidiary, the New York Yankees, played at home. As previously mentioned, before 1965, NBC aired a slate of Saturday afternoon games beginning in 1957.\nUnder the new deal, NBC paid roughly US$6 million per year for the 25 \"Games of the Week\", $6.1 million for the 1967 World Series and All-Star Game, and $6.5 million for the 1968 World Series and 1968 All-Star Game. This brought the total value of the contract (which included three Monday night telecasts such as a Labor Day 1966 contest between the San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers) up to $30.6 million.\nOn April 16, 1966, in New York City, about 50 baseball, network, and advertising officials discussed NBC's first year with the \"Game of the Week\". New York could not get a primary match-up between the Detroit Tigers and New York Yankees with Curt Gowdy and Pee Wee Reese calling the action because of local blackout rules. Instead, that market received a backup game (or \"'B' game\") featuring Tony Kubek and Jim Simpson calling a game between the Cincinnati Reds and Chicago Cubs. That rule would be eliminated after the 1983 season.\nIn replacing CBS, NBC traded a circus for a seminar. Reese said \"Curt Gowdy was its guy (1966–75), and didn't want Dizzy Dean – too overpowering. Curt was nice, but worried about mistakes. Diz and I just laughed.\" Falstaff Brewery hyped Dean as Gowdy in return said \"I said, 'I can't do \"Wabash Cannonball.\" Our styles clash --\" then came Pee Wee Reese. Gowdy added by saying about the pairing between him and Reese, \"They figured he was fine with me, and they'd still have their boy.\" To many, baseball meant CBS's 1955–64 \"Game of the Week\" thoroughbred. A year later, NBC bought ABC's variant of a mule so to speak. \"We had the Series and All-Star Game. 1966–1968's \"Game\" meant exclusivity\", said NBC Sports head Carl Lindemann, who added that \"[Colleague] Chet Simmons and liked him [Gowdy] with the Sox and football\" also, getting two network sports for the price of one. As his analyst, Gowdy wanted his friend Ted Williams. NBC's lead sponsor, Chrysler declined the idea when Williams, a Sears spokesman, was pictured putting stuff in a Ford truck.\nBefore 1966, local announcers exclusively called the World Series. Typically, the Gillette Company, the Commissioner of Baseball and NBC television would choose the announcers, who would represent each of the teams that were in the World Series for the respective year. For the 1966 World Series, Curt Gowdy called half of each game before ceding the microphone to Vin Scully in Los Angeles, and Chuck Thompson in Baltimore. Scully was not satisfied with the arrangement as he said \"What about the road? My fans won't be able to hear me.\" In Game 1 of the 1966 World Series, Scully called the first innings. When Gowdy inherited the announcing reins, Scully was so upset that he refused to say another word.\nAs previously mentioned, before , NBC typically paired the top announcers for the respective World Series teams to alternate play-by-play during each game's telecast. For example, if the Yankees played the Dodgers in the World Series, Mel Allen (representing the Yankees) would call half the game and Vin Scully (representing the Dodgers) would call the other half of the game. However, in 1966, NBC wanted its regular network announcer, Curt Gowdy, to call most of the play-by-play at the expense of the top local announcers. So instead of calling half of every World Series game on television (as Vin Scully had done in , , , , and ) they would only get to call half of all home games on TV, providing color commentary while Gowdy called play-by-play for the remaining half of each game. The visiting teams' announcers would participate in the NBC Radio broadcasts. In broadcasts of Series-clinching (or potentially Series-clinching) games on both media, NBC would send the announcer for whichever team was ahead in the game to that team's clubhouse in the ninth inning in order to help cover the trophy presentation and conduct postgame interviews.\n1967.\nIn 1967, main \"Game of the Week\" broadcasts were blacked-out in the cities of the two participating teams. In some cases, those games were aired by way of the teams' respective local flagship stations, with their local announcing crews – for example, the May 27, Dodgers–Giants contest in San Francisco was not carried by either KRON-TV in the originating city or KNBC in Los Angeles. The game was, however, telecast in Los Angeles over the Dodgers' flagship station KTTV, with Jerry Doggett and Vin Scully providing play-by-play. At the time, Dodgers' broadcasts over KTTV were limited to road games in San Francisco. Conversely the Giants' broadcast partner, KTVU, did not broadcast the team's home games in 1967. Viewers in the San Francisco Bay Area may have been able to view this game on one of two NBC affiliates from nearby areas, KSBW-TV in Salinas and KCRA-TV in Sacramento, California.\n1968.\nThe June 8, 1968 \"Game of the Week\" broadcast was cancelled due to coverage of the funeral/burial of Robert F. Kennedy. Cleveland at Detroit and Atlanta at Chicago Cubs were the games scheduled to air on that date. Both games were canceled as well, due to Kennedy assassination.\nTony Kubek initially had trouble adjusting to the world of broadcasting. Although he had a lot to say, he was gangling, he tended to stutter, and he talked too fast. Curt Gowdy soon suggested to Kubek that he should work in the off-season to improve his delivery. Kubek bought a tape recorder and took to reading poetry aloud for 20 minutes a day. In 1968, Kubek wowed as a World Series field reporter. Pee Wee Reese, who was soon fired by NBC (and replaced by Kubek as the top analyst) said of Kubek \"He wormed his way around, but I wasn't bitter. I just think if you don't have anything to say, you should shut your mouth.\"\n1969.\nIn the early years of the League Championship Series, NBC typically televised a doubleheader on the opening Saturday, followed by a single game on Sunday (because of NFL coverage). They then covered the weekday games with a 1.5 hour overlap, joining the second game in progress when the first one ended. NBC usually swapped announcer crews after Game 2. From to , the Major League Baseball television contract allowed a local TV station in the market of each competing team to also carry the LCS games. So in 1969, for example, Mets fans in New York could choose to watch either the NBC telecast or Lindsey Nelson, Bob Murphy and Ralph Kiner on WOR-TV.\nGames 3, 4, and 5 of the 1969 World Series are believed to be the oldest surviving color television broadcasts of World Series games (even though World Series telecasts have aired in color since ). However, they were \"truck feeds\" in that they do not contain the original commercials, but show a static image of the Shea Stadium field between innings. Games 1 and 2 were saved only as black-and-white kinescopes provided by the CBC. CBC also preserved all seven games of the and 1968 World Series (plus the 1968 All-Star Game) in black-and-white kinescope."

        "title": "Major League Baseball on television in the 1970s",
        "text": "By 1969, Major League Baseball had grown to 24 teams and the net local TV revenues had leaped to $20.7 million. This is in sharp contrast to 1950 when local television brought the then 16 Major League clubs a total net income of $2.3 million. Changes baseball underwent during this time, such as expansion franchises and increasing the schedule from 154 games to 162, led to a wider audience for network and local television.\nFrom 1972 to 1975 NBC televised Monday games under a contract worth $72 million. In 1973, NBC extended the Monday night telecasts (with a local blackout) to 15 straight. On September 1, 1975, NBC's last \"Monday Night Baseball\" game, in which the Montréal Expos beat the host Philadelphia Phillies 6–5.\nIn the aftermath of the thrilling 1975 World Series, attendance figures, television contracts (this time including two networks, NBC and now ABC), and player salaries all soared. In the eyes of some, that particular World Series restored baseball as America's national pastime (ahead of football).\nYear-by-year breakdown.\n1970.\nIn 1970, NBC televised the second games of both League Championship Series on a regional basis. Some markets received the NLCS at 1:00 pm. Eastern Time along with a 4:00 p.m. football game, while other markets got the ALCS at 4:00 p.m. along with a 1:00 p.m. football game.\n1971.\nIn 1971, Sandy Koufax signed a ten-year contract with NBC for $1 million to serve as a broadcaster on the \"Saturday Game of the Week\". Koufax never felt comfortable being in front of the camera, and quit before the 1973 season.\nAlso in 1971, Game 1 of the ALCS was rained out on Saturday, October 2. NBC did not televise the rescheduled Game 1 the following day (the network had only planned an NLCS telecast that day), but added a telecast of Game 2 on Monday, October 4 (which had been a scheduled travel day).\nOn October 13, 1971, the World Series held a night game for the very first time. Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, who felt that baseball could attract a larger audience by featuring a prime time telecast (as opposed to a mid-afternoon broadcast, occurring when most fans either worked or attended school), pitched the idea to NBC. An estimated 61 million people watched Game 4 on NBC; television ratings for a World Series game during the daytime hours would not have approached such a record number.\n1972.\nIn 1972, NBC began televising prime time regular-season games on Mondays, under a four-year contract worth $72 million.\nIn the early years of the League Championship Series, NBC typically televised a doubleheader on Saturday, a single game on Sunday (because of football coverage). At the time, the network covered the weekday games with a -hour overlap, joining the second game in progress when the first one ended (unless a rain delay caused the second game to start after the first game ended, as was the case during the 1972 NLCS, when the Pirates-Reds Game 5 was delayed long enough that by the time that the A's-Tigers ALCS Game 4 was over, NBC could join the game in time for the first pitch.). NBC usually swapped announcer crews after Game 2.\nNBC did not air Game 2 of the 1972 NLCS or the 1974 NLCS.\n1973.\nIn 1973, NBC extended the Monday night telecasts (with a local blackout) to 15 consecutive games.\n1974.\nDuring NBC's telecast of the Monday night Dodgers–Braves game on April 8, 1974, in which Hank Aaron hit his record-breaking 715th career home run, Kubek criticized Commissioner Bowie Kuhn on-air for failing to be in attendance at Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta on that historic night; Kuhn argued that he had a prior engagement that he could not break.\n1975.\nStarting in 1975, Joe Garagiola and Curt Gowdy alternated as the Saturday \"Game of Week\" play-by-play announcers with Tony Kubek doing color analysis. Then on weeks in which NBC had \"Monday Night Baseball\", Gowdy and Garagiola worked together. One would call play-by-play for innings, the other would handle color analysis. Then in the bottom of the 5th inning, their roles switched. Ultimately, in November 1975, Chrysler forced NBC to totally remove Curt Gowdy from NBC's top baseball team. Instead, the company wanted their spokesman, Joe Garagiola, to call all \"A\" regular season games, All-Star Games (when NBC had them), the top League Championship Series (when NBC had it), and the World Series (when NBC had it).\nNBC hoped that, in replacing Curt Gowdy, Garagiola's charm and unorthodox dwelling on the personal would stop the decade-long ratings dive for the \"Game of the Week\". Instead, the ratings bobbed from 6.7 (1977) via 7.5 (1978) to 6.3 (1981–82). \"Saturday had a constituency, but it didn't swell\" said NBC Sports executive producer Scotty Connal. Some believed that millions missed Dizzy Dean while local-team television broadcasters split the audience. Scotty Connal believed that the team of Joe Garagiola and Tony Kubek were \"A great example of black and white\". Connal added by saying \"A pitcher throws badly to third, Joe says, 'The third baseman's fault.' Tony: 'The pitcher's'.\" Media critic Gary Deeb termed theirs \"the finest baseball commentary ever carried on network TV.\"\nAnother factor behind Gowdy's dismissal was the criticism from the national media which alleged that he sided with the Boston Red Sox (a franchise that he had covered prior to his days at NBC) on a controversial play in the 10th inning of Game 3 of the 1975 World Series. Cincinnati Reds pitcher Ed Armbrister reached base on what was ruled an error by Red Sox catcher Carlton Fisk on Armbrister's bunt attempt. Gowdy said numerous times that, in his opinion, Armbrister had interfered with Fisk. Gowdy had been given the correct interpretation by NBC Radio Producer Jay Scott (who was a Triple-A fill-in umpire at the time as well), but did not use it. Umpire Larry Barnett claimed he had received death threats on account of Gowdy's criticism. More to the point, Tony Kubek, on the NBC telecast, immediately charged that Armbrister interfered (with the attempted forceout), even though home plate umpire Barnett did not agree. Later, Kubek got 1,000 letters dubbing him a Boston stooge. Prior to Game 2 of the 1986 World Series, NBC did a feature on replays narrated by Bob Costas. One of the plays cited by Costas was the Armbrister play, and Barnett and Costas both insisted that Barnett had made the correct call, although Barnett declared, \"You won't find many people in Boston who believe it was the right call.\" Costas used the feature to condemn the suggested notion of instant replay to settle calls, noting that it was the \"same kind of mentality that adds color to classic movies and calls it progress.\"\nWhile Gowdy was on hand in the press box for Carlton Fisk's legendary home run in Game 6 of the 1975 World Series, the actual calls went to two of Gowdy's Red Sox successors, Dick Stockton on television and Ned Martin on radio. Gowdy was Martin's color commentator on that home run. Meanwhile, according to the NBC cameraman Lou Gerard located above the third base stands, cameramen at the time were instructed to follow the flight of the ball. Instead Gerard was distracted by a rat nearby, thus he lost track of the baseball and instead decided to capture the image of Fisk \"magically\" waving the ball fair.\nNBC's last \"Monday Night Baseball\" game aired on September 1, 1975, in which the Montréal Expos beat the Philadelphia Phillies, 6–5. Curt Gowdy called the games with Tony Kubek from 1972 to 1974, being joined in the 1973 and 1974 seasons by various guest commentators from both within and outside of the baseball world (among them Dizzy Dean, Joe DiMaggio, Satchel Paige, Bobby Riggs, Dave DeBusschere, Howard Cosell, Mel Allen, Danny Kaye and Willie Mays). Jim Simpson and Maury Wills called the secondary backup games. Joe Garagiola hosted the pre-game show, \"The Baseball World of Joe Garagiola\", and teamed with Gowdy to call the games in 1975.\nExcept for Game 1 in both League Championship Series, all games in 1975 were regionally televised. Game 3 of both League Championship Series were aired in prime time, the first time such an occurrence happened.\n1976.\nUnder the initial agreement with ABC, NBC and Major League Baseball (running through the 1976 to 1979 seasons), both networks paid $92.8 million for the league broadcast rights. ABC paid $12.5 million per year to show 16 Monday night games in 1976, 18 in the next three years, plus half the postseason (the League Championship Series in even-numbered years and World Series in odd-numbered years). NBC paid $10.7 million per year to show 25 Saturday \"Games of the Week\" and the other half of the postseason (the League Championship Series in odd-numbered years and World Series in even-numbered years).\nMajor League Baseball media director John Lazarus said of the new arrangement between NBC and ABC \"Ratings couldn't get more from one network so we approached another.\" NBC's Joe Garagiola was not very fond of the new broadcasting arrangement at first saying \"I wished they hadn't got half the package. Still, 'Game', half of the postseason – we got lots left.\" By 1980, income from television broadcasts accounted for a record 30% of the game's $500 million in revenues.\nIn 1976, ABC picked up the television rights for \"Monday Night Baseball\" games from NBC. For most of its time on ABC, the Monday night games were held on \"dead travel days\" when few games were scheduled. The team owners liked that arrangement as the national telecasts didn't compete against their stadium box offices. ABC on the other hand, found the arrangement far more complicated. ABC often had only one or two games to pick from for each telecast from a schedule designed by Major League Baseball. While trying to give all of the teams national exposure, ABC ended up with far too many games between sub .500 clubs from small markets. Reviewing the network's first two weeks of coverage for \"Sports Illustrated\", William Leggett opined: \"It may be unfair to say that \"Monday Night Baseball\", as it has been presented by ABC so far this season, is the worst television treatment ever given a major sport, because by all odds somebody at sometime must have done something worse. But it is difficult to remember when or where that might have happened.\"\nJust like with \"Monday Night Football\", ABC brought in the concept of the three-man-booth (originally with Bob Prince, Bob Uecker, and Warner Wolf as the primary crew) to their baseball telecasts. Said ABC Sports head Roone Arledge \"It'll take something different for it to work - i.e. curb viewership yawns and lulls with Uecker as the real difference\", so Arledge reportedly hoped. Prince disclosed to his broadcasting partner Jim Woods about his early worries about calling a network series for the first time. Prince for one, didn't have as much creative control over the broadcasts on ABC as he did calling Pittsburgh Pirates games on KDKA radio. On the June 7, 1976 edition of \"Monday Night Baseball\", Prince returned to Three Rivers Stadium, from which he had been exiled for over a year. Although Prince received a warm reception, he was confused when the next day the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" read: \"Ratings are low, negative reviews rampant.\"\nJune 28, 1976, the Detroit Tigers faced the New York Yankees on \"Monday Night Baseball\", with 47,855 attending at Tiger Stadium and a national television audience, Tigers pitcher Mark \"The Bird\" Fidrych talked to the ball and groomed the mound, as the Tigers won, 5–1 in a game that lasted only 1 hour and 51 minutes. After the game, the crowd would not leave the park until Fidrych came out of the dugout to tip his cap.\nFor ABC's coverage of the 1976 All-Star Game, the team of Bob Prince, Bob Uecker and Warner Wolf alternated roles for the broadcast. For the first three innings, Prince did play-by-play with Wolf on color commentary and Uecker doing field interviews. For the middle innings, Uecker worked play-by-play with Prince on color and Wolf doing the interviews. For the final three innings, Wolf worked play-by-play with Uecker on color and Prince doing interviews.\nBob Prince was gone by the fall of 1976, with Keith Jackson, Howard Cosell, and guest analyst Reggie Jackson calling that year's American League Championship Series. (Warner Wolf, Al Michaels and guest analyst Tom Seaver worked the NLCS.) On the subject of his dismissal from ABC, Bob Prince said \"I hated Houston, and ABC never let me be Bob Prince.\" MLB commissioner Bowie Kuhn strongly objected to ABC's recruitment of Howard Cosell because of comments by Cosell in recent years about how dull baseball had become. But Roone Arledge held the trump card as the contract he had signed with Major League Baseball gave ABC the final say over announcers. So Cosell worked the 1976 ALCS and became a regular member of \"Monday Night Baseball\" the next season.\nKeith Jackson was unavailable to call Game 1 of the 1976 ALCS because he had just gotten finished calling an Oklahoma-Texas college football game for ABC. Thus, Bob Uecker filled-in for Jackson for Game 1. Uecker also took part in the postgame interviews for Game 5 of the 1976 ALCS, while Warner Wolf did an interview of George Brett in the Kansas City locker room.\n1977.\nOn June 18, 1977, in the New York Yankees' 10–4 loss to the Boston Red Sox in a nationally televised game at Fenway Park in Boston, Jim Rice, a powerful hitter but a slow runner, hit a ball into right field that Reggie Jackson seemed to get to without much speed, and Rice reached second base. Furious, Yankees manager Billy Martin removed Jackson from the game without even waiting for the end of the inning, sending Paul Blair out to replace him. When Jackson arrived at the dugout, Martin yelled that Jackson had shown him up. The two men argued, and Jackson said that Martin's heavy drinking had impaired his judgment. Despite Jackson being eighteen years younger, about two inches taller and maybe 40 pounds heavier, Martin lunged at him, and had to be restrained by coaches Yogi Berra and Elston Howard. Red Sox fans could see this in the dugout and began cheering wildly; NBC television cameras showed the confrontation to the entire country.\nStill on the disabled list toward the end of the 1977 season, Mark Fidrych worked as a guest color analyst on a \"Monday Night Baseball\" telecast for ABC; he was subsequently criticized for his lack of preparation, as when play-by-play partner Al Michaels tried talking with him about Philadelphia Phillies player Richie Hebner and Fidrych responded, \"Who's Richie Hebner?\" As an American League player, Fidrych had never had to face Hebner, who played in the National League.\nThe 1977 World Series marked the first time that the participating teams' local announcers were not featured as booth announcers on the network telecast of a World Series. 1977 was also the first year in which one announcer (in this case, ABC's Keith Jackson) provided all of the play-by-play for a World Series telecast. In previous years, the play-by-play announcers and color commentators had alternated roles during each game. Meanwhile, Yankees announcer Bill White and Dodgers announcer Ross Porter alternated between pregame/postgame duties on ABC and calling the games for CBS Radio. White worked the ABC telecasts for the games in New York (including the clubhouse trophy presentation ceremony after Game 6) while Porter did likewise for the games in Los Angeles.\n1978.\nIn 1978, Baseball Hall of Famer Don Drysdale joined ABC Sports with assignments such as \"Monday Night Baseball\", \"Superstars\", and \"Wide World of Sports\". In , Drysdale covered the World Series Trophy presentation. According to Drysdale \"My thing is to talk about inside things. Keith [Jackson] does play-by-play. Howard's [Cosell] role is anything since anything can happen in broadcasting.\" When ABC released and then rehired him in 1981, Drysdale explained it by saying \"If there is nothing to say, be quiet.\" Ultimately, Drysdale seemed to be slowly phased out of the ABC picture as fellow Hall of Fame pitcher Jim Palmer was considered ABC's new poster child \"[of] superior looks and...popularity from underwear commercials.\" By 1989, Palmer would earn $350,000 from ABC for appearing on around ten regular season broadcasts and making a few postseason appearances.\nFor a national television audience, the 1978 American League East tie-breaker game (New York Yankees/Boston Red Sox) aired on ABC with Keith Jackson and Don Drysdale on the call. Meanwhile, the game aired locally in New York City on WPIX and on WSBK in Boston. Phil Rizzuto, Frank Messer and Bill White called the game on WPIX while Dick Stockton and Ken Harrelson called the game on WSBK. Also in 1978, Keith Jackson called an Oklahoma-Texas college football game for ABC and then, flew to New York, arriving just in time to call Game 4 of the ALCS that same night (October 7).\n1979.\nIn 1979, 22 teams (all but the Atlanta Braves, Houston Astros, New York Mets, and St. Louis Cardinals) participated in a one-year cable deal with United Artists Television and Columbia Pictures Television, then-owners of the USA Network. The deal involved the airing of a Thursday night \"Game of the Week\" in markets at least 50 miles (80 km) from a major league park. The deal earned Major League Baseball less than $500,000, but led to a new two-year contract for 40–45 games per season. The program ran through the 1983 season.\nWith USA's Thursday night coverage, it ended ABC's Monday night broadcast's position as the exclusive national, prime time television franchise for Major League Baseball.\nThe start of ABC's \"Monday Night Baseball\" coverage was moved back to June, due to poor ratings during the May sweeps period. In place of April and May prime time games, ABC began airing \"Sunday Afternoon Baseball\" games in September. The network also aired one Friday night game (Yankees at Angels) on July 13 of that year. On August 6, 1979 the entire Yankee team attended team captain/catcher Thurman Munson's funeral in Canton, Ohio. Teammates Lou Piniella and Bobby Murcer, who were Munson's best friends, gave eulogies. That night (before a national viewing audience on ABC's \"Monday Night Baseball\") the Yankees beat the Baltimore Orioles 5–4 in New York, with Murcer driving in all five runs with a three-run home run in the seventh inning and a two-run single in the bottom of the ninth."

        "title": "Major League Baseball on television in the 1940s",
        "text": "NBC television's relationship with Major League Baseball technically dates back to August 26, 1939. It was on that particular date that on W2XBS (an experimental television station in New York City which would ultimately become NBC's flagship station, WNBC), the first-ever Major League Baseball game was televised. With Red Barber announcing, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Cincinnati Reds played a doubleheader at Ebbets Field. The Reds won the first game 5–2 while the Dodgers won the second, 6–1. Barber called the game without the benefit of a monitor and with only two cameras capturing the game. One camera was on Barber and the other was behind the plate. Barber had to guess from which light was on and where it pointed.\nBy 1947, television sets, most with five and seven-inch screens, were selling almost as fast as they could be produced. Because of this, Major League teams began televising games and attracted a whole new audience into ballparks in the process. People who had only casually followed baseball began going to the games in person. In 1948, Major League Baseball's total attendance reached a record high of 21 million.\nYear-by-year breakdown.\n1947.\nGillette, which produced World Series telecasts from roughly 1947-1965 (before 1966, local announcers, who were chosen by the Gillette Company, the Commissioner of Baseball, and NBC television, exclusively called the World Series), paid for airtime on DuMont's owned-and-operated Pittsburgh affiliate, WDTV (now KDKA-TV) to air the World Series. In the meantime, Gillette also bought airtime on ABC, CBS, and NBC. More to the point, in some cities, the World Series was broadcast on three different stations at once. For example, the 1947 World Series (for which DuMont only televised Games 2, 6–7 with Bill Slater on the call) was only seen in four markets via coaxial inter-connected stations: New York City, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Schenectady, New York; Washington, District of Columbia; and, environs surrounding these cities. Outside of New York, coverage was pooled.\n1947 also saw the first televised World Series. The games were broadcast in the New York City area by NBC's WNBT, CBS's WCBS-TV and DuMont's WABD and sponsored by Gillette and Ford. The October 1947 \"Billboard\" reported over 3.9 million viewing the games, primarily on TV sets located in bars (5,400 tavern TV sets in NYC alone). The October 13, 1947 edition of \"Time\" magazine reported that President Truman, who had just made the first Oval Office TV appearance on October 5, 1947 and received the first TV for the White House, watched parts of the Series but \"skipped the last innings\". In addition to New York City, live coverage of the Series was also seen on WRGB in Schenectady/Albany, WPTZ in Philadelphia, WMAR-TV in Baltimore and WTTG in Washington, D.C.\n1948.\nOn April 16, 1948, Chicago's WGN-TV (run by Jake Israel) broadcast its first big-league game, with Jack Brickhouse calling the White Sox' 4-1 defeat of the Cubs in an exhibition game at Wrigley Field. WGN televised each Cubs and White Sox home game live. According to Brickhouse, \nIn 1948, the World Series would be carried on the aforementioned stations, as well as on WBZ-TV and WNAC-TV in Boston, WNHC-TV in New Haven and WTVR-TV in Richmond, Virginia. \nTo clarify, games in Boston were only seen in the Northeast. Meanwhile, games in Cleveland were only seen in the Midwest and Pittsburgh. The games were open to all channels with a network affiliation. In all, the 1948 World Series was televised to fans in seven Midwestern cities: Cleveland, Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee, St. Louis, and Toledo.\nTom Hussey helped Red Barber call Games 1–2 and 6 in Boston, while Van Patrick assisted Barber in calling Games 3-5 in Cleveland.\n1949.\nCBS' first ever official Major League Baseball telecast occurred on July 12, 1949. It was 16th annual All-Star Game from Ebbetts Field in Brooklyn and featured Red Barber on the play-by-play. The Major League Baseball All-Star Game wasn't truly nationally televised until 1952.\nBy , World Series games could now be seen east of the Mississippi River. The games were open to all channels with a network affiliation.\nThe World Series was also seen live in other Northeastern and Midwestern cities (Harrisburg, Pittsburgh, Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo, Erie, Cleveland, Detroit, Columbus, Cincinnati, Dayton, Toledo, Indianapolis, Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Louis) that had been hooked up to network lines over the previous year."

        "title": "Major League Baseball on television in the 2000s",
        "text": "In September 2000, Major League Baseball signed a six-year, $2.5 billion contract with Fox to show Saturday baseball, the All-Star Game, selected Division Series games and exclusive coverage of both League Championship Series and the World Series.\nUnder the previous five-year deal with NBC (1996–2000), Fox paid $115 million while NBC only paid $80 million per year. Fox paid about $575 million overall while NBC paid about $400 million overall. The difference between the Fox and the NBC contracts implicitly values Fox's Saturday \"Game of the Week\" at less than $90 million for five years. Before NBC officially decided to part ways with Major League Baseball (for the second time in about 12 years) on September 26, 2000, Fox's payment would've been $345 million while NBC would've paid $240 million. Before 1990, NBC had carried Major League Baseball since 1947.\nWhen asked about the new deal with Fox, Commissioner Bud Selig said, \"We at Major League Baseball could not be happier with the result. They have been a good partner and an innovative producer of our games.\"\nNeal Pilson, who served as the president of CBS Sports when the network had the exclusive television rights for Major League Baseball said of Fox's $2.5 billion deal: \nSome observers believed that gaining the relative ratings boost from the League Championship Series and World Series meant more to Fox than the other broadcast networks. This was because Fox had suffered the biggest prime time ratings decline among the four major networks during the 1999–2000 television season, with an average prime time audience of 8.97 million viewers, down 17% from the year before according to Nielsen Media Research.\nYear-by-year breakdown.\n2000.\nFor a Saturday afternoon telecast of a Los Angeles Dodgers/Chicago Cubs game at Wrigley Field on August 26, 2000, Fox aired a special \"Turn Back the Clock\" broadcast to commemorate the 61st anniversary of the first televised baseball game. The broadcast started with a recreation of the television technology of 1939, with play-by-play announcer Joe Buck working alone with a single microphone, a single black-and-white camera, and no graphics; each subsequent half-inning would then see the broadcast \"jump ahead in time\" to a later era, showing the evolving technologies and presentation of network baseball coverage through the years.\nIn 2000, NBC was caught in the dilemma of having to televise a first-round playoff game between the New York Yankees and Oakland Athletics over the first presidential debate between George W. Bush and Al Gore. NBC decided to give its local stations the option of carrying the debate or the baseball game. If an NBC affiliate decided to carry the debate, then the Pax TV affiliate in their local market could carry the game. NBC also placed a crawl at the bottom of the screen to inform viewers that they could see the debate on its sister channel MSNBC.\nOn the other end, Fox said that it would carry baseball on the two nights when its schedule conflicted with the presidential or vice presidential debates. NBC spokeswoman Barbara Levin said \"We have a contract with Major League Baseball. The commission was informed well in advance of their selecting the debate dates. If we didn't have the baseball conflict we would be televising it.\" Although there has not been confirmation, anecdotal reports indicated that many NBC affiliates in swing states (such as Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania) chose to air the debate over the baseball game. This is an option that CBS affiliates did not have in 1992, when that network refused to break away from Game 4 of the American League Championship Series (which had gone into extra innings) to the first Clinton–Bush–Perot debate. Like NBC and Fox would do in 2000, CBS cited its contract with Major League Baseball.\nDuring NBC's coverage of the 2000 Division Series between the New York Yankees and Oakland Athletics, regular play-by-play announcer Bob Costas decided to take a breather after anchoring NBC's prime time coverage of the Summer Olympic Games from Sydney. In Costas' place was Atlanta Braves announcer Skip Caray, who teamed with Joe Morgan before Costas' return for the ALCS. It wasn't just Costas but all of NBC's production crews who were down in Sydney. The Olympics ended just two or three days before the MLB playoffs started that year, so the TBS crew worked the Division Series games for NBC.\nAs previously mentioned, in September 2000, Major League Baseball signed a six-year, $2.5 billion contract with Fox to televise Saturday afternoon regular-season baseball games, the All-Star Game and coverage of the Division Series, League Championship Series and World Series. 90% of the contract's value to Fox, which was paying the league $417 million per year, came from the postseason, which not only attracted large audiences, but also provided an irreplaceable opportunity for the network to showcase its fall schedule. Under the previous five-year deal with NBC (running from 1996 to 2000), Fox paid $115 million ($575 million overall), compared to the $80 million ($400 million overall) that NBC paid. The difference between the Fox and the NBC contracts was that Fox's Saturday \"Game of the Week\" was implicitly valued at less than $90 million for five years. Before NBC officially decided to part ways with Major League Baseball (for the second time in about 12 years) on September 26, 2000, Fox's payment would have been $345 million, while NBC would have paid $240 million. NBC Sports president Ken Schanzer said regarding the loss of Major League Baseball rights for the second time since 1990:\nNBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol added that it was not cost-effective for NBC to be paying out the kind of money that Major League Baseball wanted. The network was also reportedly concerned over disruptions to its regular fall prime time lineup that would result from having to broadcast the playoffs and World Series. In addition, NBC had several NASCAR races scheduled during the summer.\nEbersol further added:\nThe last Major League Baseball game that NBC televised until 2022 was Game 6 of the 2000 American League Championship Series, occurring on October 17, 2000. In Houston, due to the coverage of the 2000 Presidential Debate, KPRC-TV elected to carry NBC News' coverage of the debate while independent station KNWS-TV carried the ALCS game via NBC.\n2001.\nFor the 2001 season, Fox implemented a new graphics package for its MLB telecasts, which debuted on the network's NASCAR broadcasts in February of that year. The graphics package was an updated version of the design in 1999, but its score bug was revised as a top-screen banner. A simple, transparent black rectangle with a shaded area above it spanned the top of the screen from left to right, displaying the diamond graphic representing the baseball diamond, and the abbreviations of both teams in white. The scores would be shown in yellow boxes next to the team abbreviations; the center showed the inning (a triangle was placed to the left of the inning number to show which half-inning it was: pointing up to represent the top of an inning and pointing down to represent the bottom of an inning), to the right was the number of outs, right of that was the pitch count and the pitch speed (the pitch speed was in the same location as the pitch count, and the pitch speed would appear be in a yellow box); and the \"MLB on Fox\" logo was placed on the far right. This banner, along with the shaded area above it, retracted from the top of the screen whenever it appeared or was removed.\nFor the 2000 and 2001 seasons, the Fox network's then-sister cable channel, Fox Family (later ABC Family, now Freeform) carried a weekly Major League Baseball game on Thursday nights (a game that had previously aired nationwide on Fox Sports Net from 1997 to 1999), as well as select postseason games from the Division Series. Among the noteworthy games that aired on Fox Family was the October 4, 2001 game between the San Francisco Giants and the Houston Astros, during which Barry Bonds hit his 70th home run of the season, which tied the all-time single season record that Mark McGwire had set only three years earlier (Bonds broke the record the next night).\nMeanwhile, the Fox Broadcasting Company's other sister cable channel FX, aired numerous Saturday night Major League Baseball contests in 2001, including Cal Ripken Jr.'s final game at Camden Yards. FX also aired one game in the Major League Baseball postseason each year from 2001 to 2005, on the first Wednesday night of League Championship Series week when the league scheduled two games at the same time. On that night, Fox distributed one game to local affiliates with the availability of coverage being based on region, and the other game aired on the corresponding cable affiliate of FX, the main DirecTV or Dish Network channel, or an alternate channel on the satellite providers.\nESPN was on hand for the Cleveland Indians' historic comeback against the Seattle Mariners on August 5, 2001. The Indians trailed 14–2 after six innings, but scored twelve runs in the final three innings before winning in the bottom of the eleventh, 15–14. The twelve-run comeback tied the Major League record for largest deficit overcome in a game.\nFor the first year of its exclusive six-year contract (2001), Fox did a split telecast (which had not been attempted since the ill-fated \"Baseball Network\" arrangement existed) for the League Championship Series. This meant that two games were played simultaneously on the same night, with one game airing on the Fox network and the other on the regional Fox Sports Net cable channel (depending on market, as some markets did not have a regional sports network with a relationship to FSN). The rationale behind the split-telecast was that because of the September 11 attacks, the entire post-season schedule was delayed by a week. Because of this, two Sunday LCS games came in conflict with a \"Fox NFL\" doubleheader. Fans and sports journalists were unimpressed with the situation and MLB commissioner Bud Selig vowed that it was a one-time deal necessitated by circumstance. However, in later years, Fox used split telecasts on a few occasions to keep the playoffs \"on schedule\" and maximize its prime time advertising revenue, and aired the second game on FX, which has virtually nationwide distribution on cable and satellite. This ensured that Fox did not have to air an LCS game on a weekday afternoon, when many viewers are unable to watch. The 2007–2013 contract eliminated this issue, as TBS had rights to one of the League Championship Series each year. However, Fox continued to air afternoon LCS games on weekdays through the entire length of the contract.\n2002.\nAs part of its 2001 purchase of Fox Family, in addition to rights to the Thursday night game, The Walt Disney Company acquired the MLB rights that were also held by FX. Those two game packages were moved to ESPN beginning with the 2002 baseball season; however, the playoff games remained on ABC Family for one additional year due to contractual issues. A deal was reached to move those playoff games to ESPN, which produced the games for ABC Family, starting with the 2003 season. Although the games aired on networks owned by Disney, Fox kept the exclusive negotiation rights to renew the contract after the 2006 season. Fox chose not to renew its rights to the Division Series, which went to TBS as part of its new baseball contract.\nOn June 16, 2002, \"Sunday Night Baseball\" covered a Subway Series game at Shea Stadium in which Mo Vaughn hit a game winning three-run home run in the New York Mets' 3-2 win over the New York Yankees.\n2003.\nIn 2003, the Braves telecasts on TBS underwent significant changes for the first time in many years, reflecting an increase in the network's rights fee payments to Major League Baseball. In turn, national sponsors could fulfill their advertising commitments by purchasing ads on TBS, in addition to ESPN or Fox. In the process, Don Sutton and Joe Simpson assumed duties as lead commentators, while longtime play-by-play announcers Skip Caray and Pete Van Wieren had their participation on the broadcasts reduced. This was done in an attempt to combat criticism of Caray's on-air \"home team\" bias and to market its baseball coverage to fans of MLB teams other than the Braves. Meanwhile, the brand Braves Baseball on TBS was replaced by Major League Baseball on TBS. The move was strongly criticized by Braves fans, Atlanta area media outlets and Braves manager Bobby Cox. Over 90% of Braves fans who voted in an online poll conducted by the \"Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" preferred Caray and Van Wieren to the more neutral broadcasts. The move backfired, and ratings for the TBS broadcasts declined sharply. After that year's All-Star break, TBS brought back Caray and Van Wieren to work with the two analysts, while broadcasts reverted to the \"Braves Baseball on TBS\" brand the following year.\n2004.\nOn April 16, 2004, Fox aired a Friday night game between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox to cover those teams' first head-to-head meeting since the memorable 2003 ALCS.\nScooter debuted in the 2004 baseball season on April 16, during a game between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox. While Fox Sports television chairman David Hill called Scooter \"really cute and really terrific\", the character has garnered few positive reactions otherwise, with \"Sports Illustrated\" writer John Donovan warning \"purists everywhere, grab the barf bag,\" and \"Sports Illustrated\" media writer Richard Deitsch using Scooter as an example of \"how technology does not always help society.\" \"The Sporting News\" reported polling their staff with the question \"What best summarizes your feelings for Scooter, Fox's talking baseball?\": 45% of responders chose the answer \"Send him to a slow, painful death.\" Despite most reactions, Scooter would still be used in televised baseball games until after the 2006 World Series.\nStarting with the 2004 postseason, Fox's baseball broadcasts began using the same graphics package that debuted with NFL telecasts in 2003. The score banner was changed to match the layout adopted by the network's football coverage at the start of the 2004 season, but using the abbreviations of the teams playing instead of their logos. Team abbreviations were shown this time in electronic eggcrate lettering in the team's main color, the shaded area above the score banner was removed, and the scores were shown in white text in black parallelograms. Whenever team-specific information was displayed in the banner such as a scored run or an out, the abbreviation would morph into the team logo with the scored run being displayed; the team who would score a run would have its abbreviation morph into its logo and a \"strobe light\" would flash over the black parallelogram as the score changes. When a home run was displayed in the banner, a split \"strobe light\" would flash a few times across the banner with the words \"HOME RUN (team)\" in the team's color then zooming in to the center from both left and right angles, accompanied by two distorted electric buzzes followed by a futuristic computer sounder. This marked the first time that a home run was displayed in the banner. When it appeared, flashing lights spanning the top of the screen with two moving lines on top and bottom would join to morph into the banner; when first formed, the team logos were shown before changing into the abbreviations. When it was removed, the banner became just a quick beam of light spanning the top of the screen, which would disappear very quickly.\nIn October 2004, Fox started airing all Major League Baseball postseason broadcasts (including the League Championship Series and World Series) in high definition; Fox also started airing the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in HD that year. Prior to the 2008 season, one of the three regional games the network televises each Saturday was presented in HD. Since 2008, all MLB games televised by Fox – including Saturday regional games – are presented in high definition.\nDave O'Brien provided commentary for MLB International's coverage of the World Series from 2004 until 2009. O'Brien teamed with his usual ESPN partner Rick Sutcliffe on broadcasts of the World Series and the American League Championship Series for MLB International.\n2005.\nWhile covering the 2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Comerica Park in Detroit, host Jeanne Zelasko angered many fans for her treatment of legendary broadcaster Ernie Harwell. Many disliked the way Zelasko abruptly – and in many fans' eyes, awkwardly – cut Harwell off just 17 seconds into a pre-game interview, as Harwell was detailing the accomplishments of famous Tiger Al Kaline. Harwell later said he was not offended by Zelasko, and let the matter drop. In September 2008, Zelasko took heat for referring to the Tampa Bay Rays as the \"Tampa Rays\". Jeanne Zelasko has, in general, been accused of being too flippant, not particularly knowledgeable about the sport of baseball, and inserting too many corny cliches or plays on words during broadcasts.\nOLN was briefly considering picking up the rights to the Sunday and Wednesday games, which expired after the 2005 season. On September 14, 2005 however, ESPN, then the current rights holder, signed an eight-year contract with Major League Baseball. The weekday afternoon \"DayGame\" telecasts that ESPN and ESPN2 had previously aired were eliminated in the new pact, along with the late (10 p.m. ET) Wednesday night game (although ESPN can elect to show a late game instead of an early one should it so desire), and the coverage of Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Labor Day games (except for games that fall under the regular Monday-night slot).\nESPN's Monday and Wednesday telecasts remain mostly nonexclusive, meaning the games also can be televised by each club's local broadcasters. In fact, Wednesday games are blacked out on ESPN unless a participating team's local broadcaster does not choose to televise the game. The Sunday games remain on ESPN only, and with ESPN losing the rights to \"Sunday Night Football\" telecasts, it looks likely that \"Sunday Night Baseball\" will run uninterrupted on ESPN throughout the season, except on Opening Night (when it will air on ESPN2, since it usually conflicts with the NCAA Women's Basketball Final Four).\nAlternate telecasts for home-team markets which are blacked out have also been phased out, either in an effort to save costs or in an effort to allocate more satellite space for high-definition broadcasts on ESPNHD. Those who get ESPN via cable get ESPNEWS instead, and those who get the channel via satellite see a blank picture and a blackout notice.\nMLB will receive, on average, $296 million a year under the new agreement, a television and a baseball official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of a confidentiality agreement in the deal. ESPN will pay baseball $273.5 million in 2006, $293.5 million in each of the following four years, $308.5 million in 2011 and $306 million in each of the final two seasons.\nDuring the 2005 World Series on Fox, a new white banner was introduced. This would resemble a chrome finish, and the team abbreviations became white letters in the team's main color; the next few years, the new banner was adopted for all games. This banner, unlike the 2001–2004 version, would not be removed for the final out of the World Series but was dropped at other critical points (like whenever Alex Rodriguez came to bat, tied with an April record 14 home runs, and when Barry Bonds had 753).\n2006.\nFox has used numerous scheduling formulas for its Saturday regular season coverage. These have often changed based on the rights granted by new television contracts, and the pregame programs that the network has chosen to air. From 1996 to 2006, Fox began its weekly game telecasts on the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend or the weekend before. The selection of games varied on a regional basis, and the start times were staggered based on region. A half-hour pregame show aired at 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time, followed by game broadcasts held at 1:00 p.m. in the Eastern and Central Time Zones. West Coast games did not air until 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time (1:00 p.m. in the Pacific Time Zone). All of these games were exclusive to the broadcast network, and as a result, Fox's exclusivity window lasted through the entire afternoon.\nOn July 11, 2006, Major League Baseball announced that the Fox network had signed a new seven-year contract, which guaranteed that Fox would remain the broadcaster of the World Series through the 2013 season. Fox had widely been expected to renew the deal, but it was unclear what the network would be willing to air beyond the All-Star Game and World Series.\nAfter weeks of speculation and rumors, on July 11, at the All-Star Game, Major League baseball announced that Time Warner's TBS will gain rights to a Sunday afternoon \"Game of the Week\" beginning in the 2008 season. TBS will be allowed to choose the games that it will carry and may select a single team up to 13 times. TBS also will gain exclusive broadcast rights to the Division Series in both leagues starting in 2007, as well as any tiebreakers starting with the 2007 season. On October 18, 2006, Major League Baseball announced that TBS will also carry the other League Championship Series. (Through the 2006 season, ESPN had national broadcast rights to tiebreakers, and ESPN and Fox shared coverage of the Division Series, with ESPN covering the majority of the games, while Fox was guaranteed the 8:00 p.m. Eastern slot most nights.) TBS also gained the rights to the \"All-Star Game Selection Show\", formerly on ESPN.\nAs part of the agreement, the network also announced that it will no longer cover the Atlanta Braves on an exclusive national basis after the 2007 season. Games will be subject to blackout in the teams' markets, but local broadcasters can still air the games. TBS would carry 70 Braves games in the 2007 season, in addition to the postseason package, but beginning in 2008 will only carry the Sunday game on a national basis.\nHowever, WTBS (now WPCH-TV) could still carry up to 45 games within the Braves' six-state geographical area (Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Mississippi). These games could conceivably air nationally as part of the MLB Extra Innings package.\nThe package with Fox was officially announced on October 17, 2006. Under the terms of the arrangement, Fox retained its rights to the network's regular-season package, which would now begin in April, and would remain the exclusive home of the All-Star Game and World Series. Fox's postseason coverage beyond the World Series is limited to one League Championship Series per year (the American League Championship Series in odd numbered years and National League Championship Series in even numbered years), which alternates every year with TBS (which took over exclusive rights to the Division Series from ESPN) airing the other LCS.\nOne of the terms of the deal was that, beginning with the 2007 season, the Saturday \"Game of the Week\" coverage was extended over the entire season rather than starting after Memorial Day, with most games being aired in the 3:30 to 7:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) time slot, which was reduced to 4:00 to 7:00 after Fox cancelled its in-studio pre-game program for the 2009 season. Exceptions were added in 2010 with a 3:00 to 7:00 afternoon window being used on Saturdays when Fox was scheduled to broadcast a NASCAR Cup Series race in prime time (which would start at 7:30) and a 7:00 to 10:00 window, when Fox is scheduled to broadcast the UEFA Champions League soccer final (which would start at 3:00).\nAs previously mentioned, after the 2006 Division Series, ESPN lost the rights to broadcast playoff games on TV. All postseason games, from possible one-game playoffs to the World Series, have aired on Fox Sports and TBS since 2007. Games remained on ESPN Radio. ESPN also lost rights to \"ESPN DayGame presented by Fruit of the Loom\" and \"Thursday Night Baseball powered by Castrol\".\nBecause of the reduction of ESPN's weekly schedule from five games to three, ESPN released numerous commentators from the network, including Jeff Brantley, Tino Martinez, Steve Stone and Eric Karros.\nWith the new deal coming into play this year, several things changed with the Monday and Wednesday night games in particular. For \"Monday Night Baseball\", the telecast will now co-exist with teams' local carriers up to three times per year, up from two times in previous years. \"Wednesday Night Baseball\" also changed slightly. Now, in addition to the featured game that night, they will also have some live cut-ins to other games across the nation and discuss some the hot topics in the major leagues.\nESPN telecasts in 2006, posted an average of 1,115,000 household impressions, up 27% when compared to 2005's 875,000. The corresponding 1.2 rating this year marks a 20% increase over the 1.0 average in 2005. ESPN2's baseball telecasts have averaged 704,000 households, an increase of 34% over 2005's 525,000. Ratings on ESPN2 went up 33% (0.8 vs. 0.6).\nDuring their broadcast of Game 3 of the 2006 American League Championship Series, Lou Piniella, who is of Spanish descent, made an analogy involving the luck of finding a wallet, and then briefly used a couple of Spanish phrases. Fox color commentator Steve Lyons responded by saying that Piniella was \"hablaing Español\" – Spanglish for \"speaking Spanish\" – and added, \"I still can't find my wallet. I don't understand him, and I don't want to sit close to him now.\" On October 13, 2006, Fox fired Lyons for making these remarks, which the network determined to be racially insensitive. Lyons was replaced for the last game of the series in Detroit by Los Angeles Angels announcer José Mota. Piniella later stated that he thought that Lyons was just \"kidding\" and that Lyons was, per Piniella's experience, not bigoted. Lyons had previously maligned Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Shawn Green, who is Jewish, for sitting out a game on Yom Kippur in 2004, saying \"He's not even a practicing Jew. He didn't marry a Jewish girl. And from what I understand, he never had a bar mitzvah, which is unfortunate because he doesn't get the money.\" Lyons was suspended briefly without pay after his remarks, and Fox apologized for Lyons' comments, though Lyons never made an on-air apology.\n2007.\nIn 2007, Fox began airing games every Saturday during the season. A new scheduling format was devised, in which all of the regional games started simultaneously. Fox moved the pregame, which became part of the exclusive game window, to 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time. All of the Fox games would then start at 3:55 p.m. Eastern Time, regardless of region. This format gave more leeway for teams not being shown on Fox to schedule daytime games. Fox's exclusivity began at the start of the pregame at 3:30 and ran until 7:00 p.m. Eastern.\nOn April 1, for the season-opening game between the New York Mets and the St. Louis Cardinals, ESPN changed its on-screen graphics to the version that debuted with \"Monday Night Football\" in 2006 and was later adopted by its NBA coverage at the start of the 2006-07 season. The previous graphics dated back to the advent of ESPN HD in 2004.\nIn 2007, Joe Buck was only scheduled to call eight regular season MLB games out of a 26-game schedule for Fox (along with a handful of regional St. Louis Cardinals telecasts on FSN Midwest). In an interview with Richard Sandomir of the \"New York Times\", Buck defended his reduced baseball commitment: In 2008, Buck drew criticism for comments he made during an appearance on ESPN Radio's \"The Herd with Colin Cowherd\", in which he admitted to spending \"barely any\" time following sporting events he does not broadcast, and facetiously claimed that he preferred watching \"The Bachelorette\" instead.\nIn general, Fox's initial lead broadcast team of Joe Buck and Tim McCarver had been heavily scrutinized, much less criticized over time. During the 2012 National League Championship Series between the San Francisco Giants and St. Louis Cardinals, Buck and McCarver were accused by the San Francisco media in particular, of being too biased towards the Cardinals.\nDuring the week of the All-Star Game, \"Baseball Tonight\" and \"SportsCenter\" did not travel to the game site as it normally does; the 2007 site was AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco. The reason was that MLB stripped ESPN of its on-site credentials for its studio crew as punishment for leaking the rosters of the All-Star teams before TBS did. TBS' announcement, which was billed as exclusive, was scheduled for 4 p.m. Eastern time but was delayed for nearly two hours, by which point ESPN, in apparent violation of its contract with MLB, went ahead and revealed the rosters anyway. ESPN later agreed to promote playoff coverage on TBS and Fox (alongside its own radio coverage) in return for \"Baseball Tonight\" going on the air shortly after each night's games concluded.\nESPN pre-empted part of the Kansas State–Auburn college football game on September 1 to show the end of the no-hitter thrown by Boston Red Sox pitcher Clay Buchholz.\nFrom 2007 to 2010, when TBS aired every Division Series game, start times were staggered throughout the day from early afternoon to late primetime. The first game was usually scheduled to start at 1:07 and the last game was usually scheduled for 9:07. If a game ran long, the start of the next game would be shifted to TNT (the game would move back to TBS during the first commercial break after the end of the earlier game, with an announcement from the in-studio crew to switch to TBS). For the LCS round, TBS would show all of the games at a start time pre-set by MLB. All coverage was followed by \"Inside MLB\". This schedule was brought back for 2013 only, with the exception that MLB Network aired the two games scheduled for the early afternoon slot.\nDuring some broadcasts, Fox has experienced various technical difficulties. During its broadcast of Game 3 of the 2007 World Series between the Colorado Rockies and Boston Red Sox, for instance, a blackout occurred during the top half of the seventh inning, resulting in the disruption of a key moment in the game.\n2008.\nBeginning with the 2006 NFL season, Fox's other properties, the NFL, NASCAR, the Bowl Championship Series, and Formula One, again upgraded their graphics packages (Formula One used a different graphics package than the other three properties), but baseball broadcasts continued to use this on-screen design in 2007. It was also used in the July 12, 2008 game between the Colorado Rockies and the New York Mets until the 9th inning, but with the 2008 graphics package instead of the package that was used with this banner.\nESPN2 showed the season-opening games in Tokyo between the Red Sox and the Oakland Athletics. Unfortunately, due to a transponder failure, viewers on DirecTV reliant on the standard-definition feed missed the first of the two games. (ESPNHD was unaffected.)\nOn March 30, ESPN showed the first-ever game at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. The Nationals defeated the Atlanta Braves on a walk-off home run by Ryan Zimmerman.\nOn May 4, ESPN introduced enhanced updates targeting viewers who play fantasy baseball. It shows season batting statistics for the current batter on each potential count and updates batting average and other selected stats after the at-bat concludes.\n\"Sunday Night Baseball\" broadcast the Washington Nationals' very first game at Nationals Park on March 30, 2008. The Nationals beat the Atlanta Braves, 3–2, on Ryan Zimmerman's walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth. President George W. Bush, who threw out the ceremonial first pitch prior to the game, joined Jon Miller and Joe Morgan in the ESPN booth during the telecast.\nThe final game played at Yankee Stadium on September 21, 2008, pitting the New York Yankees against the Baltimore Orioles, was broadcast on \"Sunday Night Baseball\".\nThe Mariano Rivera 500th career save (and also his 1st lifetime RBI) was broadcast on \"Sunday Night Baseball\" from Citi Field (home of the New York Mets).\nTBS began airing the game just prior to the last out in the bottom of the first, with announcer Chip Caray apologizing to viewers for \"technical difficulties.\" TBS acknowledged there was a problem with one of the routers used in the broadcast transmission of the relay of the telecast from Atlanta.\n2009.\nFox discontinued its pregame show in 2009, with the telecasts now beginning at 4:00 p.m. Eastern and the game time being pushed to 4:10. Fox gave up the first half-hour of its exclusivity, with its window now beginning at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time.\nFor the 2009 season, telecasts began using the same graphics package implemented by FSN, with the scoreboard now including a rectangular box in the top-left corner of the safe area. Along with FSN in observance of the holiday weekend, the baserunner graphic was changed to a blue pattern with stars during the Fourth of July weekend and All-Star Game in 2010. Also in July 2010, broadcasts began to be produced in full widescreen and letterboxed for standard definition viewers through the use of the #10 Active Format Description code (which is primarily used for Fox broadcasts transmitted to pay television providers via its stations). The score box was moved to be in the top-left corner of the widescreen feed.\nSome sports media critics were critical of the announcers used in the coverage on TBS as being more skewed towards the National League than the American League, along with the choice of Chip Caray (who along the way, was criticized for making factual mistakes during postseason broadcasts) as the lead voice of the network's coverage, as he had only done Braves baseball telecasts during the 2007 season before TBS assumed rights to playoff coverage.&lt;ref name=\"Sandomir 10/10\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In response to such criticisms, Caray said, \"It wasn't the job that I had when I came here in the first place. It would be like being a pinch-hitter or being a relief pitcher that works once every ten days. I'm better when I work more.\" TBS and Caray parted ways following the 2009 playoffs. Ernie Johnson Jr., Dick Stockton and Brian Anderson began handling play-by-play duties in his place.\nFollowing the Philadelphia Phillies' victory in the 2009 NLCS, TBS studio host Ernie Johnson went to the podium to present the championship trophy."

        "text": "On August 28, 2012, it was announced that ESPN and Major League Baseball had agreed on a new eight-year deal that increased ESPN's average yearly payment from about $360 million to approximately $700 million.\nYear-by-year breakdown.\n2010.\nStarting with the April 3 season opener between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox, ESPN began using the same graphics package which debuted with \"Monday Night Football\" in . The score banner was converted to a score box in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. And instead of numbers to represent the balls, strikes and outs, dots were represented for each: three green dots for balls, two yellow dots for strikes, and two red dots for outs. The pitch count was also introduced, adopted from the New York Yankees' broadcasts on the YES Network, as well as NESN for the Boston Red Sox. College baseball and softball broadcasts, however, continued to use the previous (2007) graphics for the 2010 College World Series telecasts. ESPN's coverage of the Little League World Series also retained the 2007 graphics until midway through, and then adopted the current (2010) graphics package.\n\"Baseball Tonight\", a daily highlight show aired on ESPN during the baseball season, likewise introduced new graphics adopted from \"SportsCenter\" in June 2010.\nAlso in 2010, Jon Miller and Joe Morgan began their 21st consecutive season working together for ESPN. Among U.S. network television sportscasters, only Pat Summerall and John Madden (who called NFL games for CBS and Fox from 1981 to 2001) have had a similar length partnership in the booth. Following the 2010 season, ESPN announced that the television contracts of Miller and Morgan would not be renewed. Miller was offered, but chose to decline, a continued role with ESPN Radio.\nIn July 2010, Fox's on-screen graphics were repositioned for the 16:9 aspect ratio, as all HDTV programming from the Fox network began to be presented in a letterboxed format using an Active Format Description code for standard definition viewers. The supposed high-definition picture, however, has been derided as coming across as highly imperfect, lacking the detail and clarity normally expected from a high-definition broadcast.\nFrom 2007 to 2010, when TBS aired every Division Series game, start times were staggered throughout the day from early afternoon to late primetime. The first game was usually scheduled to start at 1:07 and the last game was usually scheduled for 9:07. If a game ran long, the start of the next game would be shifted to TNT (the game would move back to TBS during the first commercial break after the end of the earlier game, with an announcement from the in-studio crew to switch to TBS). For the LCS round, TBS would show all of the games at a start time pre-set by MLB. All coverage was followed by \"Inside MLB\". This schedule was brought back for 2013 only, with the exception that MLB Network aired the two games scheduled for the early afternoon slot.\nBeginning with the 2010 MLB playoffs, Fox has used its NFL theme music for its MLB coverage (and all other Fox Sports properties, including NASCAR and UFC events). There has been backlash from fans who believe that the NFL theme does not belong on MLB coverage, and that the previous MLB theme should return. A poll by Sports Media Watch noted that as of October 23, 2010, while nearly 60% of fans thought that Fox made a bad move, only 11% thought it was a good move and 30% had no opinion (all percentages rounded).\n2011.\nStarting with Opening Day of the 2011 MLB season, both the Fox broadcast network and Fox Sports Networks began using the same graphics package adopted for \"NFL on Fox\" telecasts in 2010, featuring a new horizontal layout with team abbreviations (as opposed to the use of team logos on the NFL version) and scores flanking a display of the inning, diamond, count, outs (represented by 3 lights), and pitch speed in the center. The new scoreboard was also able to slide open to reveal statistical information or home run notifications.\nThe \"ESPN Major League Baseball\" score box was slightly modified beginning with the opening day game between the Detroit Tigers and the New York Yankees. Numbers indicating the ball, strike and out counts replace the dots used last year; the out dots were adopted by Fox Sports Net on their local broadcasts as well as \"Major League Baseball on Fox\". The pitch speed and count are now fixed below the bases graphic. Also, the area around the bases graphic and ball, strike, and out counter is slightly translucent.\nBeginning with the \"Sunday Night Baseball\" interleague game between the New York Yankees and the Chicago Cubs on June 19, the graphics were slightly adjusted to fit in with the aspect ratio for HD broadcasts, similar to what Fox Saturday Baseball, Root Sports and Fox Sports Net have done for their baseball coverage. TBS would follow suit in adjusting their graphics to the 16:9 aspect ratio.\nIn 2011 and 2012, TNT aired its own slate of postseason Division Series games, due to MLB's desire to air fewer games in the early afternoon. This was the first time TNT had ever aired regularly scheduled MLB games, however it used TBS's announcers and production crews with the only difference being the TNT logo in the scorebox replacing the usual TBS logo.\nIn 2011, TNT aired Rays–Rangers Game 1, Tigers–Yankees Games 1 and 2, and Brewers–Diamondbacks Game 3. In 2012, TNT aired Reds–Giants Game 1, and A's–Tigers Games 4 and 5.\nDuring the network's coverage of Game 1 of the 2011 American League Division Series between the Texas Rangers and Tampa Bay Rays, TBS was alleged to have featured doctored headlines with incorrect attributions. On October 1, during the middle of an at-bat during Game 1 of the 2011 ALDS between the New York Yankees and Detroit Tigers, TBS suddenly cut to an ALDS game between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Texas Rangers, which was airing on TNT, for about 14 seconds. Moments later (as TBS was coming out of a replay and showing the Tigers' dugout), cameras missed Yankees right fielder Nick Swisher making a diving catch (instead showing Yankees pitcher Iván Nova walking off the mound and pumping his fist). TBS (in particular, throughout their coverage of the 2011 postseason) has also been criticized for placing the center-field camera precisely in the center. Therefore, every time a pitcher began his windup, his head would block the view of home plate.\n2012.\nThe score box and other graphics on ESPN were carried over from 2011, but a new logo for all ESPN MLB presentations was unveiled at the start of the season. The ESPN logo is fixed on a CGI baseball, with the words 'Major League Baseball' (or \"Baseball Tonight\" and \"Sunday\", \"Monday\" or \"Wednesday Night Baseball\") in a stylized neon light surrounding it. A 2-D version is also used on print ads or on secondary program IDs. The graphics would stay virtually the same for the next three seasons.\nFor 2012, Fox revised its schedule; while the 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time start time remained intact, weekly games on certain Saturdays when the network was to air NASCAR races held at Texas Motor Speedway, Richmond International Raceway and Darlington Raceway start at 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Starting with the date of the UEFA Champions League Final until the Saturday before the All-Star Break, all \"Game of the Week\" telecasts would start at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The \"Baseball Night in America\" moniker was used for all \"MLB on Fox\" games in that span.\nFor the 2012 MLB season, the score box on Fox was modified to use cap insignias instead of team abbreviations, and outs were now represented by only two lamps. Beginning with the 2012 NLCS, the score box was modified again to match the new layout adopted by Fox's NFL coverage at the start of the 2012 season; teams and scores reverted to being vertically stacked on the left, the base graphic moved to the right-hand side, pitch speed is displayed below the base graphic (which now displays the pitch count below the diamond after 40 pitches as well), while the count, outs, and inning number moved to a tab below the box. This graphic was also not removed for the final out of the World Series. In late-March 2013, the Fox Sports Networks began using this version in time for the start of the 2013 MLB season (the previous scoring bug was used for 2013 Spring training games).\nOn July 24, 2012, Matt Yoder of \"Awful Announcing\" questioned Fox's need to hire local broadcasters on their national telecasts and therefore, bringing about a perceived sense of favoritism towards one of the participating teams. For example, Billy Ripken, who played for the Baltimore Orioles alongside his Hall of Fame brother Cal, was roundly criticized for his perceived favoritism towards the Orioles while broadcasting an Orioles–Detroit Tigers game (even by actor Jeff Daniels via Twitter) for Fox the previous week. The following week came a Philadelphia Phillies–San Francisco Giants telecast on Fox, which was called by Phillies play-by-play announcer Tom McCarthy and former Phillies pitcher Mitch Williams. McCarthy and Williams were in particular, singled out for their rather downbeat manner of calling a Matt Cain home run off Cole Hamels in the top of the 3rd inning. This was contrasted by their more enthusiastic call of Hamels returning the favor with a home run in the bottom half of the inning. In 2019, Len Kasper, who is currently the voice of the Cubs, broadcast Cubs-Nationals on Fox with a rather monotonous tone of voice while calling Nationals home runs.\nOn September 19, 2012, \"Sports Business Daily\" reported that Major League Baseball would agree to separate eight-year television deals with Fox Sports and Turner Sports through the 2021 season. Fox would reportedly pay around $4 billion over eight years (close to $500 million per year) while Turner would pay around $2.8 billion over eight years (more than $300 million per year). Under the new deals, Fox and TBS's coverage would essentially be the same as in the 2007-2013 contract with the exception of Fox and TBS splitting coverage of the Division Series, which TBS has broadcast exclusively dating back to 2007. More importantly, Fox would carry some of the games (such as the Saturday afternoon \"Game of the Week\") on its all-sports channel, Fox Sports 1. Sources also said that was possible that Fox would sell some Division Series games to MLB Network, which did end up occurring.\nThe new deal between Major League Baseball and TBS was officially confirmed on October 2, 2012. Under the deal:\nDuring the 2012 American League playoffs, TBS was criticized for its graphics and game preview packages. At the start of its coverage of the American League Wild Card Game between the Baltimore Orioles and Texas Rangers, a graphical snafu resulted in Cal Ripken Jr., who was calling the game, being credited as \"Carl Ripken Jr.\" During Game 1 of the American League Championship Series between the New York Yankees and Detroit Tigers, TBS showed a graphic depicting players who played in the postseason before the age of 24 and after the age of 40. In the graphic, Willie Mays's name was misspelled as \"Willie Mayes\".\nDuring the 2012 National League Championship Series, Fox's camera angles were criticized for being directly in-line with home plate, thus often ensuring that a pitcher's head blocked the view. Fox's camera angles were again criticized (this time in an elevated and more dead center camera angle) during FS1's coverage of Game 1 of the 2016 National League Division Series between the Chicago Cubs and San Francisco Giants.\n2013.\nFans of the Pittsburgh Pirates, which in 2013, had its first winning season as well as its postseason appearance since 1992, took TBS to task for not broadcasting the traditional pre-game player introductions, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", or ceremonial first pitch during their coverage of the National League Wild Card playoff game against the Cincinnati Reds.\nDick Stockton's performance on TBS has in particular, been subject to criticism. Stockton, for instance, during the 2013 NLDS (St. Louis vs. Pittsburgh) was cited as often misidentifying players, generally appearing confused at times, and never having hosting chemistry with his analyst Bob Brenly. Meanwhile, Joe Simpson, who was the only holdover from the \"Braves TBS Baseball\" days, has been accused of not really adding anything to the booth and often deferring to John Smoltz during their time together on the 2013 Boston–Tampa Bay series.\nField reporter Erin Andrews' performance has been criticized since she joined Fox Sports' MLB coverage in 2012. For example, Andrews during trophy presentations, has been accused of showing an extreme lack of knowledge by reading off notes. More to the point, during the trophy presentation at the end of the 2013 American League Championship Series, Andrews misidentified former Anaheim Angels owner and honorary American League president Jackie Autry as her late husband Gene. Andrews was further criticized during the trophy presentations for the 2014 World Series due to her very generic questions that for the most part, lacked insight.\nDuring the bottom of the 9th in Game 4 of the 2013 World Series between the Boston Red Sox and St. Louis Cardinals, Fox's cameras missed Boston closer Koji Uehara picking off pinch runner Kolten Wong to end the game (it was the first postseason game in baseball history to end on a pickoff).\n2014.\nFor the 2014 season, Fox's sister cable channel Fox Sports 1 began providing Major League Baseball game coverage, carrying a \"Fox Saturday Baseball\" doubleheader on most weeks. FS1's coverage begins with the pregame show a half-hour before the game, which usually starts at 1:00 or 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time. A second game usually follows at either 7:00 or 8:00 Eastern Time. If there is a gap between the first and second game, a studio show is not aired in between. All of the telecasts are aired nationally instead of on a regional basis; however, the telecast is not exclusive, unless the game is between two teams that whose games are broadcast on the Fox Sports regional networks. Prime time games continue to air on the Fox network, and once again used the 2010 scheduling formula for these telecasts, including full national exclusivity.\nBeginning in 2014, Fox Sports 1 added several non-exclusive Tuesday night telecasts outside of its regular Saturday schedule. These games generally feature marquee teams which may attract a large audience, along the lines of the 2004 Red Sox-Yankees telecast or the Mark McGwire telecasts. In 2015, one Thursday game was scheduled, though this was during a rare week in which \"Fox Saturday Baseball\" was not scheduled to air.\nAs part of Fox Sports' new Major League Baseball broadcast deal, in April 2014, Fox Sports 1 premiered \"MLB Whiparound\", an hour-long nightly baseball highlight program (similar in vein to ESPN's \"Baseball Tonight\" and MLB Network's \"MLB Tonight\") featuring quick-turnaround highlights, and news and analysis from around the league (live look-ins of games being played in progress generally can not be shown on \"Whiparound\", as \"MLB Tonight\" is reserved that right exclusively). It is hosted by Chris Myers, who is joined by one or two analysts rotating between Frank Thomas, Eric Karros, Dontrelle Willis and C. J. Nitkowski. Although \"Whiparound\" airs most weeknights at 10:00 p.m., the Wednesday editions are usually delayed to 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time on weeks when Fox Sports 1 airs a sporting event in prime time during the MLB season (on weeks without predetermined programming conflicts, the program airs in its regular 10:00 p.m. slot).\nFor the 2014 season, Fox's MLB coverage debuted a new graphics package first seen on its NASCAR broadcasts that year. Notably, the score box was moved to the bottom-left corner of the screen. The box places the team abbreviations and scores on the left side over the team's background color. On the top of the right side is the inning (which is the only component in yellow text) and the base graphic; the lower right contains the count and outs (represented by two dots). Above the main box is a new \"dynamic\" strip, which by default shows the last name of the current pitcher along with the number of pitches he has thrown. However, this strip can be expanded and change color to display team-specific information, such as on-deck hitters and pitchers warming up in the bullpen. In June 2015, this was also expanded to include a white area featuring the last name of the current batter and their performance throughout the game (or their average for their first time at-bat). When a home run is hit, the main box turns to the team's color and displays the text \"Home Run\", while the dynamic strip grows and displays the name of the team over the team's logo. Other times (usually on FSN), the dynamic strip displays the name of the player who hit that home run and the main box displays the type of home run and how many home runs that player has hit during the season. The graphics package itself is similar to the previous design, though these graphics are more in the shape of a square, with a typeface that is less athletic in style than the previous Fox graphic packages. Starting with the 2016 season, the score box was moved to the bottom right.\nWith Fox Sports 1 taking over some of the Major League Baseball coverage in 2014, postseason coverage on Fox Sports' end of the package began to be split between the Fox broadcast network and Fox Sports 1. Four games from both National League Division Series matchups aired on Fox Sports 1, with the remaining game airing on MLB Network; however, all of the telecasts were produced by Fox and used Fox Sports announcers (although Bob Costas served as a play-by-play announcer for one of the games). Fox Sports then carried exclusive coverage of the National League Championship Series – in which the Fox network aired a traditional telecast of Game 1, while Fox Sports 1 aired an experimental telecast supplemented by advanced metrics and statistics and standard telecasts for Games 2 through 5. Fox would air Game 6 if necessary, while a possible Game 7 (which did not occur) would end up airing on Fox Sports 1; the Fox network would air the World Series in its entirety. As part of their contract renewal before the 2019 season, Fox has agreed to air any LCS Game 7 on the broadcast network.\nWith TBS only holding the rights to half of the postseason beginning in 2014, the network aired games at start times that did not conflict with Fox, ESPN, or MLB Network's coverage of the postseason, and airs \"Inside MLB\" following the conclusion of its own coverage instead of at the conclusion of all games on a given day.\nErnie Johnson Jr. has been accused of not playing to his strengths as a broadcaster in his role as TBS's lead play-by-play man. More to the point, Johnson was accused of (in part because of his very conversational announcing style in the booth) never really seeming to be able to capture the big, exciting, transformational moments during his broadcast of the 2014 American League Wild Card Game between the Kansas City Royals and Oakland Athletics. For example, there was Johnson's rather subdued call of Brandon Moss’s second home run that gave Oakland a 5-3 lead in the top of the 6th.\nAlso during their coverage of 2014 AL Wild Card Game, TBS put a graphic that incorrectly said that Oakland manager Bob Melvin was in his fourth straight playoff appearance, but this was only his third straight (2012, 2013 and 2014). Throughout the evening, TBS's broadcast was cited in not having enough adequate camera angles for replays that provided value to viewers. As opposed to productions that bring extra resources and cameras to playoff games, TBS's broadcast of this particular game was cited as feeling more like a weekly or regional telecast. That was arguably manifested in Kansas City Royals legend George Brett being forced into a \"Very Funny\" promo.\n2015.\nFor the 2015 season, ESPN introduced a new on-air appearance for baseball. Among its changes were a new, persistent K-Zone Live graphic, consisting of a faded white rectangle that is overlaid live atop the strike zone on the home plate camera angle at all times. A new K-Zone 3D graphic, with ball trails and a three-dimensional box representing the strike zone, can also be used during replays. The new live K-Zone graphic was criticized by viewers and the media for being potentially distracting, drawing comparisons to baseball video games and Foxs \"glowing puck\" from its NHL coverage.\nOn August 30, 2015, former softball player Jessica Mendoza joined the \"Sunday Night Baseball\" broadcast team as a color commentator. For the 2016 MLB season, former Yankees player Aaron Boone joined Shulman and Mendoza in the broadcast booth as the second color commentator for \"SNB\". Shulman stepped down at the conclusion of the 2017 season, while Boone left the booth after being named new Yankees manager.\nDuring the bottom of the third inning of Game 5 of the 2015 National League Division Series between the New York Mets and Los Angeles Dodgers, TBS's cameras caught a tense exchange between Dodgers manager Don Mattingly and outfielder Andre Ethier. So when TBS went to an interview conducted between innings by Sam Ryan in the Dodgers' dugout with Mattingly, the assumption was that Ryan would ask Mattingly what happened. Ryan then proceeded to ask Mattingly instead, how he thought Zack Greinke was pitching, what he thought of the game so far. Later in the broadcast, Cal Ripken Jr. brought up what we had all seen when Ethier came up to bat again in the fifth, saying, \"We’re still guessing what that argument was all about.\"\nIn Game 2 of the aforementioned Mets-Dodgers NLDS, Ripken was quick to categorize Chase Utley's slide into Mets shortstop, Rubén Tejada (which broke Tejada's leg) as a clean play, \"a little late,\" and nothing more than \"competitive baseball\".\nSince along with Tom Verducci, succeeding Tim McCarver as Fox's lead color commentator in 2014, Harold Reynolds has been accused contributing to little more superficial, surface-level stuff on telecasts. For example, during Game 5 the 2015 American League Championship Series, when Toronto's Chris Colabello cranked a solo homer in the second, Reynolds' simple contribution was, \"Well, I guess he made an adjustment.\" More to the point, immediately after, Verducci jumped in and explained how that was the first home run that Kansas City starter Edinson Vólquez had allowed in his past 1,228 changeups. Reynolds’ response was \"How do you know that? Unbelievable, Tom. You were sitting on that one, weren’t you?\"\nFox suffered an outage during their broadcast of Game 1 of the 2015 World Series resulting in a brief delay in the game. After a brief cutaway to the Los Angeles studios (missing one at-bat), Fox picked up the MLB Network-produced feed, which is broadcast to viewers outside the United States. This feed used Fox's #2 announce team of Matt Vasgersian and John Smoltz. After two innings, Fox's #1 crew of Joe Buck, Harold Reynolds and Tom Verducci entered and called the action worldwide. An inning later, Fox had their own broadcast back up and running, with Buck, Reynolds and Verducci refunding to the Fox booth, while Vasgersian and Smoltz re-entered the MLBN booth.\nSince 2015, production of the MLB International broadcasts has been assumed by MLB Network. Matt Vasgersian (formerly of Fox and today part of \"ESPN Sunday Night Baseball\" in addition to the MLB Network, also former play-by-play television announcer for the San Diego Padres) has served as the play-by-play commentator; for the 2016 World Series onward, he was joined by Buck Martinez (play-by-play analyst of the Toronto Blue Jays for Sportsnet—which has carried the world feeds due to his involvement, and former color commentator for TBS) on color. Since 2018, with Matt now with ESPN part-time in addition to his MLB Network duties, Buck was joined for the All-Star Game duties by former \"Sunday Night Baseball\" voice Dan Shulman (who has also been paired with Martinez on selected Blue Jays games).\n2016.\nAt the beginning of the 2016 season, TBS introduced new graphics that were used all season including the postseason.\nThe score box, which was originally docked to the top and left edges of the screen, was completely redesigned for 2017 after much criticism during the 2016 postseason.\nBeginning in 2016, the usually all-news network CNN en Español carries TBS's postseason coverage with the Spanish language audio, though no language adjustments are made to the on-screen graphics. The Spanish audio is also available through TBS's second audio program, and the coverage on CNN en Español is subject to pre-emption for appropriate breaking news coverage.\nDuring the top of the third inning of Game 3 of the 2016 American League Division Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Texas Rangers, TBS's Matt Winer was doing a live interview with Texas third base coach Tony Beasley, when Rangers shortstop Elvis Andrus hit a home run. Winer had to cut off Beasley during the interview to tell the audience that Andrus got \"a double\", before then realizing it was a home run. When Andrus finally rounded third base, Winer said, \"Excuse me, that's not a double; that's a home run.\" As a direct result of all of this, there wasn't full screen of the Andrus homer, nor was there a proper play-by-play of the home run.\nDuring the 2016 season, TBS debuted a new scoreboard design that was criticized by viewers for its large size. The following season, TBS was criticized again for having initially made its scoreboard too small.\nFollowing Game 1 of the 2016 World Series, Fox affiliate WJW in Cleveland, which would carry the Cleveland Indians' World Series appearance via Fox, aired a brief commercial criticizing TBS, in light of the mistakes and errors that had run rampant throughout their playoff coverage.\n2017.\nIn the 2017 season, ESPN introduced a new camera angle known as \"Front Row Cam\"; it is designed to provide a \"low-home\" camera angle, and utilizes a cylindrical camera pointed vertically at a mirror inside an enclosure positioned along the wall behind home plate. During the American League Wild Card Game, ESPN also introduced a new \"immersive\" K-Zone 3D component, which allows the data to be rendered into a virtual stadium environment to be viewed at different perspectives.\nFor the 2017 postseason, Fox's MLB coverage unveiled a new graphics package first seen on its NFL telecasts, though the same layout from the 2014 version for the scoring bug continued to be used, with the addition of two statistical panes atop the scoring bug for batter/pitcher matchups, game at-bat results, and individual statistics. Also, the inning indicator, the ball-strike counter and the out counter (which is now back to being numerically represented) were all moved to the bottom of the scoring bug.\n2018.\nThe 2018 season saw a revamp of ESPN's lead commentary team, with Matt Vasgersian succeeding Dan Shulman, and Alex Rodriguez joining as analyst. ESPN also anticipated increased use of the Front Row Cam on \"Sunday Night Baseball\", and the immersive K-Zone 3D feature being employed on all games (a move enabled by ESPN's full adoption of on-site graphics and replay systems operated remotely from its main studios in Bristol). ESPN also unveiled a major on-air rebranding for its MLB coverage.\nDuring the 2018 ALDS, analyst Ron Darling apologized after making an insensitive comment about New York Yankees starter Masahiro Tanaka during Game 2 of the Yankees' series against Boston. Early in the broadcast while attempting to point out a weakness of Tanaka’s, Darling said “A little chink in the armor for Tanaka here. It’s the first inning where he’s lost a little of his control.”\nDuring the 2018 World Series John Smoltz was heavily criticized for appearing to hate the direction baseball is going in.\nOn November 15, 2018, Fox renewed its rights, set to expire in 2022, through 2028. The contract maintains Fox's current coverage structure, but with expanded digital rights, and the commitment to air more games on the Fox broadcast network when the new deal takes effect. Fox also committed to airing at least two of its League Championship Series games, as well as any Game 7, on the broadcast network beginning in 2019; it had been criticized for airing only Game 2 of the 2018 National League Championship Series, while placing the rest on Fox Sports 1.\n2019.\nIn February 2019, Fox announced plans to air two weeks of regional games on Thursday nights in September of that season, in lieu of Saturday games (which creates conflicts with its college football coverage. They will additionally serve as a prelude to Fox's \"Thursday Night Football\" broadcasts."

The Gulls charged out of the gate, winning 24 games in their first season of NCAA play but they could not keep that pace. USIU produced just 8 wins the following year (albeit in 21 games) and, after surging back with an 18-win year in 1982, the program put up losing records three straight seasons before Howe was replaced by former Minnesota head coach Brad Buetow. The new coach coincided with U.S. International forming the Great West Hockey Conference with Alaska–Anchorage, Alaska–Fairbanks and Northern Arizona.\nIn Buetow's first season he got the Gulls back on their winning ways, producing a 20 win season and winning the inaugural conference championship. After a mediocre second season the Gulls returned in force in 1987–88, winning 23 games and being a finalist for the last at-large bid to the 1988 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. 1988 was the last hurrah for the program, however. After Northern Arizona couldn't continue after their first season in the conference, USIU had only the Alaska schools as conference partners and travelling to the largest state was just as prohibitively as expensive as anywhere else in the country. The university had tried to induce several nearby schools to begin their own ice hockey programs, including USC, UCLA and Arizona but after three years the school was no longer able to financially support the program and it was shuttered.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of United States International alumni were a part of an Olympic team."

        "text": "The Fortnite World Cup was an esports competition based on the video game \"Fortnite\". It took place between July 26–28, 2019 at the Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York City, United States. A total prize pool was available across the various competitions.\nOverview.\nThe Fortnite World Cup uses two of the game modes available to the video game, \"Fortnite\". The main World Cup event as well as the Pro-Am use \"Fortnite Battle Royale\", a battle royale game where up to 100 players airdrop onto an island without any weapons or armor, save for a pickaxe. Once on the ground, players must scavenge for weapons, armor, and healing items, as well as using their pickaxe to knock down existing features to gather wood, stone, and metal resources. This all must be done while avoiding attacks from other players, as well as staying within a shrinking circle on the map or risk taking fatal damage outside it. Players can use gathered resources to build walls, floors, and stairs and ramps to use as cover from attacks. The last player or team left alive wins.\nThe Fortnite World Cup had online events over 10 weeks from April to June 2019 for people to place. The weeks alternated between solo players and duos teams. During the Saturday of each week, any player or duo could compete with others by geographic region, playing up to 10 matches to earn points through eliminations and victories. The top three thousand players/teams from each region then competed on the Sunday event, again playing up to ten matches to earn points. The top point-scorers in each region from the Sunday event then proceed through to the World Cup, a total of about twenty players/teams each week. An estimated 40 million players vied for spots in the solo and duos World Cup. In the World Cup finals, the competitors played a total of six matches, with points earned for the highest finishers. The solo player or duo with the highest point total after six matches won the grand prize, with other players getting part of the prize pool available. All solo players received a minimum of for reaching the finals, with the top prize being . Similarly, each duo team in the final received a minimum of with the top team winning .\nThe Fortnite Creative Cup had a similar online process to select the players for the finals, taking place over five two-week periods from April to June 2019. Each active week, a new Creative challenge is available. Players, once completed with their Creative island, must submit a video of that challenge to Epic in that period. For each period, Epic selected three of the best entries by a panel of judges. Each selected entry earns a cash prize of and a guaranteed spot in the Creative Cup finals. From the fifteen winning entries, five were selected by Epic to be used in the Creative Cup finales. In the finales, eight teams of four, consisting of those that had their Creative island selected and other notable \"Fortnite\" players, complete in these five events to earn the best overall score. The winners in the finale split a prize pool.\nThe teams for the Fortnite Pro-Am are selected by Epic Games, with each team made up of a \"Fortnite\" streamer and a celebrity. The teams each played five matches, with a scoring system for the winning teams. The team with the highest overall score after five matches won the Pro-Am. Each team received a minimum of with the winning team receiving US$2 million.\nHistory.\nEpic Games had launched \"Fortnite\" in its original planned form, now known as \"\", as an early access title in July 2017, around the same time that the first influential battle royale game, \"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds\" (PUBG) was released. Inspired by this, Epic created a variation of \"Fortnite\" and released it as \"Fortnite Battle Royale\" in September 2017. While free-to-play, the game was supported by microtransactions. \"Fortnite Battle Royale\" rapidly became popular, and by June 2018, with the game ported to computer, consoles, and mobile devices, had reached 125 million players. Total 2018 revenue for \"Fortnite Battle Royale\" was estimated at by analysis firm SuperData Research. Epic designated of these revenues to position \"Fortnite Battle Royale\" as an esport.\nThe inaugural Fortnite World Cup was first announced in February 2019. While Epic planned to run the event in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led Epic to cancel the event for the year, though will still hold other \"Fortnite\" seasonal championship events known as Fortnite Champion Series.\n2019 events.\nFormat.\nThe Fortnite World Cup was split into two different events, one for solo players, and a separate for two-player teams, or duos.\nBoth the solos and duos formats consisted of six matches.\nWorld Cup solo and duo final standings:\nSolos.\nThe 2019 solo event finals were held on July 28, 2019, and was won by 16-year-old American Kyle \"Bugha\" Giersdorf, who took home the grand prize. \nThe scoring format in solos provided points for eliminations and for placement. Competitors received one point for each elimination and non-cumulative placement points. For solos the placement points were as follows:\nDuos.\nThe duo event finals were held on July 27, 2019, with Emil Bergquist Pedersen (\"Nyhrox\") and David Wang (\"Aqua\") sharing its grand prize.\nThe scoring format in duos provided points for eliminations and for placement. Competitors received one point for each elimination and non-cumulative placement points. For duos the placement points were as follows:\nCreative Cup.\nThe creative cup involved 8 teams, each led by a popular Fortnite icon. The team leaders held qualifiers, in which they had those attempting to qualify participate in a challenge in creative mode. The top 3 performers on each challenge were recruited to their respective leader's team. The cup included three different creative game maps: a king of the hill map, a prop hunt map, and a death run map. Each map had one round with three matches dedicated to it, and the final round had one match on each map. In the end, the “Fish Fam” led by FaZe Clan's Cizzorz won the event.\nCreative Cup final standings:\nPro-Am.\nThe 2019 Fortnite Pro-Am matched 50 popular \"Fortnite\" streamers with various celebrities, and was held on July 26, 2019, at The Forum In Los Angeles, CA, for a prize to be split between the winning pair to go to charities of their choice. Streamer Airwaks and music producer RL Grime won the event, their second win after a similar Pro-Am event at E3 2019, with their selected charities being the World Wildlife Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union, respectively. Other teams split the remaining prize pool for charity, with each team assured a minimum of .\nPro-Am final standings:\nOther activities.\nIn addition to the games in the stadium, the area around the stadium in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park was set up for a number of fan events, such as contests and games, and a concert by Marshmello.\nViewership.\nEpic reported that tickets for the 23,700-capacity stadium venue were sold out. An estimated 2.3 concurrent million viewers on Twitch and YouTube streaming services watched the World Cup finales; additional viewers included those watching the final events from within \"Fortnite\", and China viewership.\nLater developments.\nShortly after his win in the World Cup, Kyle “Bugha” Giersdorf had been swatted while streaming from his home. However, one of the officers responding to the call had recognized Giersdorf from his win, and quickly calmed the situation down to determine that they were responding to a false call.\nThere have not been any subsequent editions of the World Cup since the inaugural event due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

The race was hosted on 7 July 2019 to coincide with the 2019 ITU World Triathlon Series Hamburg race, and featured 32 men and 32 women representing 16 countries. The race was around the Binnenalster, an artificial lake in central Hamburg. The race followed the standard mixed relay format, where each athlete would swim 300m, cycle 7 km and run 1.7 km before tagging their next teammate to do the same, with the specified gender order of female—male—female—male.\nCourse.\nThe event was contested in the city centre of Hamburg, for the relay each of the four athletes would complete the same course one after another. The 300m swim is an out and back course in the Alster. Due to the location of the Reesendammbrücke bridge athletes were required to pass under the bridge both going out and coming back. After the swim a short run to the transition area was required. The cycle consisted of two 3.5 km laps along a flat and technical circuit. The course held two 180° turns as well as many 90° turns with the laps mainly following the shore of the artificial lake Binnenalster. The cycle finished at the same transition area, leading to a 1.7 km run costing of two laps of differing lengths (0.95 km and 0.75 km). Both laps where mostly flat and crossed the Reesendammbrücke bridge.\nThe course was designed to be as spectator-friendly as possible, with the race being the most popular on the ITU's calendar pulling in crowds of over 250,000 gather most years.\nQualification.\nThe qualification was organised by the ITU however a nation wishing to compete must send a bid to the ITU at least 60 days before the competition. From all bids the ITU gives automatic qualification to the host nation, which as for the past six years has given immediate entry for the German team. The ITU also gives the top 11 nations (excluding the host) from the previous years championship automatic qualification. Then the best placed teams in each continental championship to not have already qualified gain a spot. After this all the remaining bids are listed in order of their results form their continental championship and the remaining spaces are filled from the best placed team. If any team should withdraw from the championship the best ranked team from their continent not to have qualified will replace them.\nResults.\nSource:"

In general, a ground belongs only to the batter who is closest to it, and stays so until the other batter gets closer to it. \nWhether a batter is in or out of his ground is defined by Law 30 of the Laws of Cricket. So long as the batter has his body or his bat (that he is holding) touching the ground, he is in it, and is said to have \"made good his ground\". \nBatters can run between the two grounds to score runs. However, if a batter is out of his ground (which can happen when he enters a ground that another batter is already occupying), he may be dismissed (prevented from further scoring) by being run out or stumped if the wicket in his ground is put down by the ball."

The defending Pan American Games champion is David Oliver from the United States.\nSummary.\nOut of the blocks, Greggmar Swift was the first over the first hurdle with Jarret Eaton in lane 9 on the far outside a close second hitting his first. Swift and Eaton were almost stride for stride through 3 hurdles, though Eaton had flattened all of his hurdles and Gabriel Constantino, next to Swift sped into contention. At the fifth hurdle, Eaton hit it square with his foot, riding it down off balance and Swift was also slightly off balance, drifting to his left going into five, giving Constantino the lead. Eaton sidestepped six, taking himself off the track and the faster moving Constantino had a clear lead. Shane Brathwaite and Freddie Crittenden were pulling even with Swift. At the seventh everything changed, Constantino looks like he came up too close to the hurdle and tried to quick step it. He failed miserably crashing to the ground. Brathwaite and Crittenden found themselves in a neck and neck battle for the lead as Swift struggled. Dodging Constantino as he fell into his lane, Crittenden seized a slight advantage over 9 and 10, but Brathwaite was faster on the run in to take the narrow win. Eduardo Rodrigue caught Swift at the 9th hurdle and continued in for bronze.

He played for the Indianapolis Kautskys in the National Basketball League in six games during the 1945–46 season, but was released on December 14, 1945.\nBiography.\nBorn in Union Township, Indiana, Baker was a standout athlete growing up. He attended Union High School from 1933 to 1937 where he was an all-county basketball player. He then attended Franklin College from 1937 to 1941 and played for the school's football and basketball teams. While in college he was also a member of the Kappa Delta Rho fraternity. Outside of school, Baker joined a powerhouse semi-professional industrial basketball league team, Stewart-Warner, in 1939. Baker helped Stewart-Warner win the national industrial championship in 1939–40.\nBaker served in the Army during World War II as a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division, where he saw combat in Europe. After his military discharge he took a job as a sales representative by the Skelgas division of the Skelly Oil Company, a position he would hold until his premature death. He did continue playing basketball both professionally and semi-professionally. Baker had a six-game stint for the Indianapolis Kautskys where he averaged 2.5 points per game. He also played for the semi-pro team Indianapolis Secos in 1946–47.\nDeath.\nOn November 28, 1950, Baker was playing in an industrial league game at Franklin Gymnasium in Frankfort, Indiana. He began to feel ill during the third quarter and sat out the remainder of the contest. That night, he died of a heart attack in his home at age 31."

        "text": "Games played (most often abbreviated as G or GP) is a statistic used in team sports to indicate the total number of games in which a player has participated (in any capacity); the statistic is generally applied irrespective of whatever portion of the game is contested. In baseball, the statistic applies also to players who, prior to a game, are included on a starting lineup card or are announced as \"ex ante\" substitutes, whether or not they play; however, in Major League Baseball, the application of this statistic does not extend to consecutive games played streaks. A starting pitcher, then, may be credited with a game played even if he is not credited with a game started or an inning pitched. The catcher is a position for a baseball or softball player. When a batter takes his/her turn to hit, the catcher crouches behind home plate, in front of the (home) umpire, and receives the ball from the pitcher. In addition to these primary duties, the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well. The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the catcher is assigned the number 2.\nBecause catching is generally regarded as the most grueling position in baseball, catchers have historically played fewer games than any other non-pitching position; it is still unusual for a player to catch all of their team's games for even a month. Only eight players in history have caught in all of their team's games over the course of a season; five of those achieved the feat in the 19th century, when the seasons were generally much shorter, and the other three did so during World War II, when player availability was sharply limited. Prior to 1944, only seven players caught 145 games in a season, none more than once. When Bob Boone became the first player to catch 2,000 major league games in 1988, it was over a quarter century after every other non-pitching position had seen a player reach that milestone. But in recent decades, the workload of top major league catchers has gradually increased, and the top ten career leaders all made their major league debuts after 1968.\nIván Rodríguez is the all-time leader in games played as a catcher, playing 2,427 games at the position. Carlton Fisk (2,226), Bob Boone (2,225), Yadier Molina (2,184), Gary Carter (2,056) and Jason Kendall (2,025) are the only other players to play 2,000 or more games as a catcher. Molina, of the St. Louis Cardinals, is the only player to catch 2,000 games with one team."

        "title": "1981–82 North Dakota Fighting Sioux men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1981–82 North Dakota Fighting Sioux men's ice hockey team represented the University of North Dakota in college ice hockey. In its fourth year under head coach John Gasparini, the team compiled a 35–12–0 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the ninth time. The Fighting Sioux defeated Wisconsin 5–2 to win the championship game at the Providence Civic Center in Providence, Rhode Island.\nSeason.\nEarly season.\nIn the summer of 1981 the WCHA suffered a tremendous upheaval. Two years after a proposal to divide the Conference into two divisions was rejected, the three Michigan schools along with Notre Dame left for the CCHA, a lesser but more geographically-centered conference. As a result, the WCHA was left with only 6 teams though those teams had combined to win 5 of the previous 6 national championships. The six teams scrambled to fill up their conference schedules against one another which resulted in several cases of unbalanced home/road games between WCHA members.\nRegardless of their conference issues, North Dakota began the season on the road against Bowling Green, taking both games against the eventual CCHA champion. The following week UND hosted Northern Arizona, who were only in their second year of Division I play, and easily won both games with a combined score of 18–4. The Fighting Sioux ended their non-conference start with a pair of games against Providence and could only manage to split the weekend after a promising 6–0 win.\nThe Sioux's first loss of the year began an alternating cycle of wins and losses that lasted for over a month and plagues them through their early WCHA play. Even when the team headed to San Diego for a brief respite from the winter cold they couldn't shake the pattern and UND returned home with a 10–6 record but only 4–4 in conference. In mid-December North Dakota finally climbed out of their funk and won four consecutive games to close out the first part of their regular season.\nHoliday Tournament.\nNorth Dakota headed to Troy to participate in the Rensselaer Holiday Tournament but with the team losing several members to the World Junior championship the Fighting Sioux couldn't stop St. Lawrence from posting 7 goals in the contest. UND salvaged the tournament with a win in the consolation game before barely squeaking by a down Boston University squad.\nAfter returning home North Dakota returned to their conference schedule and won two tight games against Denver before splitting a road series at Colorado College. After capturing another home series UND headed to Wisconsin to take on the defending national champions as well as their biggest competition for the WCHA regular season title. At this point in the season Wisconsin was comfortably in the lead with a 14–1–1 conference record but UND had the ability to close the 7-point gap. The Fighting Sioux shut out Wisconsin in the first game but the Badgers came storming back to turn the tables on North Dakota and the two teams drew even after the weekend.\nWith UND needing a minor miracle to catch up to Wisconsin they played the two worst teams in the WCHA over a two-week span and won all four games. Fortunately, UND got the help they needed when Wisconsin split consecutive weekends (at home no less) and arrived in North Dakota with only a 3-point lead in the standings. The Fighting Sioux took full advantage and swept the weekend to put themselves atop the WCHA for the first time all season. With only one weekend remaining in the regular UND only needed to hold serve with Wisconsin but luck stayed on their side when the Badgers lost an 8–9 contest to Minnesota–Duluth. North Dakota won their first game against Denver and won the WCHA title, earning the first Broadmoor Trophy which replaced the MacNaughton Cup that Michigan Tech kept when they left the conference.\nWCHA tournament.\nWith only six teams left in the conference the WCHA decided to include all members in the postseason tournament with the top two seeds receiving byes to the semifinal. As conference champion, North Dakota sat idle for a weekend before welcoming Denver to Grand Forks. After a close win in game 1 UND captured the series with a 3-goal win to put them in the first WCHA championship series in 5 years. The only team standing in their way was Wisconsin who were looking for revenge after being passed for the conference title. In the first game North Dakota suffered their worst lost in six years, losing 0–9 at home. Because the championship was a two-game total-goal series UND still had another contest against Wisconsin but with a virtually insurmountable deficit UND was flat in the second match and lost to the Badgers once more.\nNCAA tournament.\nDespite being embarrassed in the championship, North Dakota's season was not over and the 31 wins the team posted over the course of the season all but guaranteed UND with an at-large bit to the NCAA tournament. UND received the 2nd western seed and was able to host the Quarterfinal series against Clarkson. The Fighting Sioux defense showed up in full, holding the Golden Knights to a single goal in each game and advanced to the championship round in Providence.\nIn the semifinal North Dakota faced Northeastern who were making their first tournament appearance. After easily dispatching the Huskies, North Dakota faced Wisconsin for the seventh and final time. The two teams were evenly matched in the first period; Glen White opened the score less than 90 seconds in but the badgers responded less than three minutes later. The UND defense began to clamp down on UW in the second but that couldn't stop Wisconsin from again tying the game quickly. In the final period the Fighting Sioux threw caution to the wind and fired a barrage of 16 shots against Terry Kleisinger, finding the twine three times while Darren Jensen held the UND net. Team captain Phil Sykes was the story of the game, producing a hat trick along with an assist for North Dakota and allowing his team to win the national championship for the fourth time.\nAwards and honors.\nPhil Sykes set an NCAA record for total points in championship games with 9 when his totals from the 1980 game are included (still the top mark as of 2019). Sykes received the tournament MOP for his performance and was joined on the All-Tournament team by Darren Jensen, James Patrick and Cary Eades. Despite North Dakota setting a new program record with 35 wins (since broken) no players were named to the AHCA All-American West Team, however, the WCHA recognized the team's accomplishments and UND swept the individual conference awards with Sykes winning Most Valuable Player, James Patrick capturing Freshman of the Year and John Gasparini receiving Coach of the Year. Furthermore, despite North Dakota rotating three goaltenders nearly equally throughout the season, Jon Casey was named to the All-WCHA First Team with Phil Sykes while James Patrick, Craig Ludwig and Troy Murray were named to the Second Team. Jon Casey also set a new team record for wins in a season with 15 (since UND began keeping individual goaltending records in 1973).\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "title": "Nathan Patterson (baseball)",
        "text": "Nathan Patterson (born February 5, 1996) is an American former professional baseball player. Patterson attracted national media attention for throwing a fastball at 96 miles per hour in a carnival-style pitching game at a ballpark, video of which became popular and directly led to the signing of a minor league contract with the Oakland Athletics. He later played in the Milwaukee Brewers organization before retiring.\nEarly life.\nPatterson was born in 1996 in Kansas City, Missouri. His mother is a long-time nurse and real estate agent and his father a former high school baseball coach in Overland Park, Kansas. He played baseball as a middle infielder on the junior varsity team at Overland Park, but suffered a fracture in the elbow of his throwing arm during his junior year and never recovered sufficiently from the injury to resume his high school career. He enrolled in a local community college before leaving to start his own landscaping business.\nPatterson moved to Austin, Texas, in the summer of 2015 and met his girlfriend, with whom he relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, in January 2018. There he worked as a salesman of computer software.\nProfessional career.\nIn August 2018, Patterson was attending a Nashville Sounds game with his father and a friend, who convinced him to throw in a speed pitch game set up on the concourse of First Tennessee Park. \nPatterson recalled: \n\"I hadn’t thrown a ball in years. We're all hanging out, having a great time. My friend and dad go, 'Hey, let's go in the speed-pitch and throw a ball.' All right, let's go have a little fun here.\n\"My buddy hit 65 (mph), something like that. I stepped in next, first ball was 90, I was blown away. Honestly, I thought it was a joke, I thought they just jacked up the gun just to make you pay another dollar to throw another ball. I threw about five balls, and the last one I threw was 96 miles an hour. It just blew my mind, honestly.\"\nThe impressive velocity inspired Patterson to resume training for a possible return to baseball. He signed with a sports agent who put him in touch with Jarrod Parker, a former pitcher for the A's, who worked with Patterson on his pitching technique. Patterson's long-shot effort was sidetracked in December 2018 when he was hit by a car and forced to undergo surgery on his left, non-throwing wrist.\nHaving assured himself that he was on the path to full recovery, Patterson contacted the Oakland Athletics, parent major league team of the Nashville Sounds, in February 2019 and joined an amateur baseball team to hone his skill. On July 15, 2019, Patterson made a trip to Coors Field, home of the major league Colorado Rockies and lit up another fan-pitch speed booth with another 96 mph fastball. Video of his achievement came to the attention of pitching talent evaluator Rob Friedman, known as \"the pitching ninja,\" and a few days later Patterson was contacted by the A's with an offer for an entry-level minor league contract. Video of Patterson had previously been featured on Friedman's FlatGroundApp in January 2019.\nOakland Athletics.\nPatterson signed a contract with the Oakland Athletics on July 31, 2019. He was assigned to the Athletics Green of the Arizona League on August 5 of that same year. He was reassigned to the Athletics Gold on August 15 and pitched in his first professional game that evening. He struck out all three batters he faced. In addition to a fastball, Patterson features a slider clocked in the 80s. On November 18, 2020, Patterson was released by the Athletics.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nOn February 2, 2021, Patterson signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers organization. He appeared in five games for the High-A Wisconsin Timber Rattlers pitching  innings of relief while accumulating a 13.50 earned run average. He elected to retire from baseball on May 27, 2021."

        "text": "The 1979–80 North Dakota Fighting Sioux men's ice hockey team represented the University of North Dakota in college ice hockey. In its 2nd year under head coach John Gasparini the team compiled a 31–8–1 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the eighth time. The Fighting Sioux defeated Northern Michigan 5–2 to win the championship game at the Providence Civic Center in Providence, Rhode Island.\nSeason.\nEarly season.\nAfter finishing as the national runner-up in John Gasparini's first year as head coach, North Dakota was hoping to continue their renaissance after a decade of futility. The Fighting Sioux began their season with a four-game home stand and did not look particularly strong, splitting both weekends against Colorado College and Michigan Tech. After taking both road games against a bad Denver team, UND hosted St. Lawrence and won both games to push their record to 6–2.\nAfter splitting a road series against Michigan State, North Dakota hosted Minnesota in a rematch of last year's championship game, winning both games and surging to the top of the WCHA. UND sandwiched an exhibition game against the eventual gold-medalist US National Team between their series against the Golden Gophers and the Bulldogs, though in the later set the Fighting Sioux could only manage a split.\nOver the winter break North Dakota played two non-conference series. Up first Ohio State at home where UND dominated the two games. A couple of weeks later the Fighting Sioux found themselves in Marquette to take on Northern Michigan. While North Dakota was distinguishing itself as the class of the WCHA, NMU possessed an even more impressive record at 14–2 and continued to prove they were no fluke by downing North Dakota in both games.\nSecond half.\nThe two losses didn't harm UND that much as they didn't affect the team's top seed in the WCHA. However, just for good measure, the Fighting Sioux swept the next two weekends (both at home) against conference opponents to take a stranglehold of the conference. UND's lead was so large by this point that when they could only earn one win in the next four games it hardly mattered to their conference standing.\nAfter the poor road trip UND played their third national team of the season, finally managing to take town an Olympic squad, albeit the one that would finish dead-last at the 1980 winter games. After the win North Dakota went on a winning streak, beginning at home where they hadn't lost since early November. UND won their final 8 regular season games, including 4 on the road (which had given them trouble all season) to finish with a stellar 25–8–1 record and easily win the WCHA.\nWCHA tournament.\nWith the top seed, North Dakota played host to Michigan State and avenged their early-season loss with a comfortable 8–1 win in the first game. With a 7-goal lead to work with the Fighting Sioux were able to relax in game 2 and win the series 13–4. The second series against Notre Dame was more of the same with UND taking a huge lead after a 10–4 win, eventually capturing the series 17–8. North Dakota won their second consecutive WCHA title and fourth overall and received the top western seed for the NCAA tournament.\nNCAA tournament.\nUND opened against ECAC Hockey runner-up Dartmouth for the second time in as many years and had a nearly identical performance. After the 4–1 victory UND met the #1 team in the country, Northern Michigan. The teams had two of the top offenses in the nation (only Minnesota scored more goals) and game would see the top four NCAA scorers on the ice at the same time. despite being a freshman Darren Jensen had distinguished himself as the best option in goal for North Dakota and, having learned from his error the previous year, Gasparini started the Creston in goal. Doug Smail would open the scoring just before the mid-point of the first period but shortly thereafter leading scorer and team captain Mark Taylor would be knocked out of the game with an injury. Smail, the leading goal scorer, would take over and score twice more to produce only the second natural hat-trick in championship history. Phil Sykes would in on the scoring in the third period, his fourth point of the night. After the goal the Wildcat offence finally woke up and scored, scoring twice in a span of 51 seconds, but three minutes the game was put away when Smail tied the NCAA record with his fourth goal of the contest, again with a primary assist from Sykes.

        "text": "Robert Christopher Franks Jr. (born December 18, 1996) is an American professional basketball player for Nagoya Diamond Dolphins of the B.League. He played college basketball for the Washington State Cougars.\nEarly life and high school.\nFranks grew up in Vancouver, Washington and attended Evergreen High School, where he was a captain of the school's basketball team for his final three years. As a junior, he averaged 19 points and eight rebounds per game and was named All-Region by \"The Columbian\" and honorable mention Class 4A All-State by the Associated Press. Rated a three star recruit and one of the 25 top recruits in the state by \"The Seattle Times\", Franks committed to play college basketball at Washington State University going into his senior year. Franks was again named All-Region and honorable mention All-State as a senior.\nCollege career.\nFranks played four seasons for the Washington State Cougars, playing exclusively off the bench during his first two years with the team. He appeared in 23 games as a freshman, averaging 2.2 points per game and 8.3 minutes played. In his sophomore season, he appeared in all 30 of the Cougars games and averaged 6.3 points and 3.3 rebounds per game. He entered the starting lineup at the beginning of his junior year after losing over 25 pounds during the offseason. Franks finished the season 7th in the Pac-12 Conference with 17.4 points per game while also averaging 6.6 rebounds and 1.9 assists and was named honorable mention All-Pac-12 and the Pac-12 Most Improved Player of the Year. During the season he set a school record for most three-pointers made in a game with ten (on 13 attempts) against California on January 13, 2018, scoring a then-career high 34 points in total. Following the season Franks declared for the 2018 NBA draft, but did not hire an agent. He ultimately withdrew from the draft after deciding to return to Washington State for his senior season. As a senior Franks played in 27 games (26 starts) for Washington State, missing five games due to injury, and averaged a conference-best 21.6 points per game (24th highest in the nation) and finished with the ninth-highest rebounding average with 7.2 per game and was named first team All-Pac-12 and became the first WSU player to be named to the NABC All-District 20 team since Brock Motum in 2012.\nProfessional career.\nCharlotte Hornets / Greensboro Swarm (2019–2020).\nFranks worked out for several teams and participated in the NBA G League Elite Camp before the 2019 NBA draft, but was not selected.

On January 15, 2020, the Charlotte Hornets announced that they had waived Franks, without his appearing in a game for the parent team. He averaged 18.5 points, 5.6 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game for the Swarm.\nStockton Kings (2020).\nOn February 4, 2020, Franks was traded to the Stockton Kings in exchange for the returning player rights to Daniel Ochefu and the Kings' first-round pick in the 2020 G League draft. On February 19, Franks recorded 29 points and 10 rebounds in a loss to the Agua Caliente Clippers.\nLakeland / Orlando Magic (2021).\nOn November 27, 2020, Franks signed with the Orlando Magic. He was waived at the conclusion of training camp, but added to the roster of their G League affiliate, the Lakeland Magic.

        "text": "The men's artistic individual all-around competition at the 1956 Summer Olympics was held at the West Melbourne Stadium from 3 to 7 December. It was the twelfth appearance of the event. There were 63 competitors from 18 nations, with each nation entering up to 6 gymnasts. The event was won by Viktor Chukarin of the Soviet Union, the second man to successfully defend an all-around title (after Alberto Braglia in 1908 and 1912) and fourth to earn multiple medals of any color. His countryman Yury Titov took bronze. Takashi Ono of Japan earned silver. It was the first medal in the event for Japan, beginning that nation's nearly four-decade battle with the Soviet Union for dominance. Every men's all-around medal from 1956 to 1976 was won by a gymnast from one of those two nations; from 1952 to 1988, the Soviets won six of the ten gold medals while Japan won the other four.\nBackground.\nThis was the 12th appearance of the men's individual all-around. The first individual all-around competition had been held in 1900, after the 1896 competitions featured only individual apparatus events. A men's individual all-around has been held every Games since 1900.\nThree of the top 10 gymnasts from the 1952 Games returned: gold medalist Viktor Chukarin of the Soviet Union, fourth-place finisher Valentin Muratov of the Soviet Union, and ninth-place finisher Helmut Bantz of Germany. Chukarin and Muratov had tied for the World Championship in 1954.\nAustralia made its debut in the event. East and West Germany competed together as the United Team of Germany for the first time. France made its 10th appearance, tying the absent Italy for most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics format continued to use the aggregation format, mostly following the scoring tweaks made in 1952. Each nation entered either a team of six gymnasts or up to three individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The 12 exercise scores were summed to give an individual all-around total.\nNo separate finals were contested.\nExercise scores ranged from 0 to 10, apparatus scores from 0 to 20, and individual totals from 0 to 120.\nResults.\nThe results of the competition are shown below."

        "text": "The men's artistic individual all-around competition at the 1960 Summer Olympics was held at the Baths of Caracalla from 5 to 7 September. It was the thirteenth appearance of the event. There were 130 competitors from 28 nations. Each nation entered a team of six gymnasts or up to two individual gymnasts. The event was won by Boris Shakhlin of the Soviet Union, the nation's third consecutive victory in the event, putting the Soviets second all-time to that point (behind Italy's four). Takashi Ono of Japan and Yuri Titov of the Soviet Union repeated as silver and bronze medalists, respectively; they were the fifth and sixth men to earn multiple medals in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the 13th appearance of the men's individual all-around. The first individual all-around competition had been held in 1900, after the 1896 competitions featured only individual apparatus events. A men's individual all-around has been held every Games since 1900.\nSix of the top 10 gymnasts from the 1956 Games returned: silver medalist Takashi Ono, fourth-place finisher Masao Takemoto, and tenth-place finisher Nobuyuki Aihara of Japan and bronze medalist Yury Titov, seventh-place finisher Albert Azaryan, and eighth-place finisher Boris Shakhlin of the Soviet Union. Shakhlin was the reigning (1958) World Champion, with Ono and Titov finishing second and third.\nMorocco, South Korea, and the United Arab Republic each made their debut in the event. France and Italy both made their 11th appearance, tied for most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics all-around events continued to use the aggregation format. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around score.\nThese exercise scores were also used for qualification for the new apparatus finals. The two exercises (compulsory and voluntary) for each apparatus were summed to give an apparatus score; the top 6 in each apparatus participated in the finals; others were ranked 7th through 130th. There was no all-around final.\nExercise scores ranged from 0 to 10, apparatus scores from 0 to 20, and individual totals from 0 to 120."

Hodges and Luke Burt were the co-caretakers at the Gold Coast until the end of the 2019 NRL season, they were replaced by incoming head coach Justin Holbrook ahead of the 2020 NRL season.\nCraig is now a facilitator at Leading Teams.\nCoaching career.\nHodges was an assistant coach at the Titans under previous head coach Garth Brennan. He was an assistant coach to Paul Green at Wynnum Manly.\nHodges recorded back-to-back 2011-12 Queensland Cup titles with the Wynnum Manly Seagulls. Hodges then coached the Norths Devils, before taking charge of the Brisbane Broncos under 20s side between 2013 and 2016.\nIn Round 20 of the 2019 NRL season, the Gold Coast suffered their second heaviest defeat as a club losing 58–6 to the Sydney Roosters at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Hodges described the loss by saying “The fear is that it is the habit they allow...that becomes acceptable for them individually whether they stay here or whether they move on to other places, And if that’s what they take out of this season, if that’s their legacy moving forward from this season, I think that’s a terrible tragedy\".\nIn Round 22 of the 2019 NRL season against the Parramatta Eels, the Gold Coast lost the match 36–12 at Cbus Super Stadium which all but confirmed that the club would finish last and claim the wooden spoon with just 3 games remaining.\nThe Gold Coast were officially handed the wooden spoon the following week as they lost 24–8 against Melbourne at AAMI Park. The wooden spoon capped off a bad year for sport on the Gold Coast as the other team representing the region, the Gold Coast Suns finished last in the AFL.\nIn 2021, Hodges joined the New Zealand Warriors as an assistant coach.\nAfter Peter O’Sullivan, the recruitment manager for the club, left to join the newly formed Dolphins (NRL), Hodges was promoted to General Manager of Football for the Warriors in November 2021."

It was the tenth appearance of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics format continued to use the aggregation format, though the team scoring was tweaked from previous years. Each nation entered a team of between five and eight gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The top five individual scores in each exercise (that is, compulsory floor, voluntary floor, compulsory vault, etc.) were added to give a team score for that exercise. The 12 team exercise scores were summed to give a team total.\nNo separate finals were contested.\nFor each exercise, four judges gave scores from 0 to 10 in one-tenth point increments. The top and bottom scores were discarded and the remaining two scores averaged to give the exercise total. Thus, exercise scores ranged from 0 to 10, apparatus scores from 0 to 20, individual totals from 0 to 120, and team scores from 0 to 600. \nFor the vault, each competitor had two tries for each of the compulsory and voluntary vaults with the better score to count. For the other four (non-floor) apparatus exercises, the competitor had the option to make a second try only on the compulsory exercise—with the second attempt counting regardless of whether it was better than the first. For both compulsory and voluntary floor exercises, and voluntary exercises in the non-floor, non-vault apparatuses, only one attempt could be made."

        "text": "Brian Patrick Roche (born 1 July 1974) is an Irish former rugby union player and coach.\nCareer.\nFrom Togher, Cork, Roche grew up playing hurling for St Finbarr's, before a clubman from Highfield suggested that he try rugby union. A promising start to his rugby career, combined with his hurling career, in which he had won selection for the Cork minors panel, meant Roche had to choose between the two sports, and he chose rugby, joining Sundays Well in his early 20s. After one season with the club, at a time when rugby union was turning professional, Roche was approached to join English side Bath on trial, but he initially rejected the offer. When Bath returned with an offer of a professional contract, Roche then accepted, and moved across the Irish Sea to join the club, which included famous players such as Jeremy Guscott, Ieuan Evans and Mike Catt.\nAs Welsh winger Evans was away on his honeymoon, Roche got a run in the Bath starting XV, and featured prominently during the 1997–98 Heineken Cup pool stage, though he wasn't involved in the 1998 Heineken Cup Final, in which Bath defeated French club Brive 19–18. Despite this, Roche was still presented with a winners medal by Bath, making him the first Irishman to win a Heineken Cup medal. He then returned to Ireland and won selection for Munster, moving to Limerick and joining Shannon in the All-Ireland League. He remained with the province for the remainder of the 1998–99 season, but was then dropped.\nAfter being dropped, Roche returned to his roots, playing intermediate football for St Finbarr's, before returning to Highfield and captaining the side to a league championship in 2004. He also went into coaching, earning a level two badge with the IRFU and a fitness qualification, going on to work with St Finbarr's, Highfield, University College Cork A.F.C. in the Munster Senior League, and the Cork senior hurling team."

        "title": "Speed climbing wall",
        "text": "A speed climbing wall is an artificial standardised climbing wall and is the main apparatus used for competitive speed climbing.\nFor such competitions – including those in the Olympics 2020 – the speed climbing wall has been normed by the IFSC in a way that records are comparable. The norm defines height, angle and surface of the wall, shape and size of the hand and footholds as well as their position and orientation on the wall. For world records, the wall has to be produced by a licensed manufacturer as well as inspected and approved by the IFSC. For safety, it has to comply with European Norm EN 12572-1.\nSpecification.\nThe current IFSC rules for climbing competitions refer to \"artificial structures designed to ... the IFSC Speed Licence Rules\". For the latter, the most current document is from 2022.\nWhile both a 15 m and a 10 m wall are specified, world records are taken on the 15 m wall only.\n15 m wall design.\nThe wall itself has a height of 15000 mm and consists of two lanes, each 3000 mm wide, with a distance of 0 to 1000 mm from each other. The wall stands on a 200 mm socle and must continue 500 mm above the finish button, i.e. above the 15 m.\nThe wall must overhang continuously with an angle of 5°.\nThe climbable surface has to be light grey, covered by a resin-quartz with 0.1/0.4 granulometry, the numbers referring to grain sizes of fine sand.\nThe top rope anchor point must be 1000 mm higher than the climbing wall and stand out 1000 mm from the wall.\nThe layout for mounting the holds is based on a concept of square panels with a size of 1500 mm x 1500 mm each. Thus 20 panels, 10 vertically by 2 horizontally, form one of the two lanes. They are referred to by 'sn' and 'dx' (based on Italian terms for left and right), and numbered from 1 to 10 counting from the bottom.\nEach panel holds a grid of mounting holes, 11 horizontally (lettered A-K from left to right) and 10 vertically (numbered 1–10 from bottom to top). The grid spacing is 125 mm horizontally, from the edge to the next hole, and between holes. Vertically, the distance is 188 mm from the edge and 125 mm between holds. Thus the vertical size sums up as (188 + 9 x 125 + 188) = 1501 mm, which is 1 mm more than the specified panel size. The holes have M10 threaded inserts.\nTolerances are typically of ±1 mm for panel-based measures, and ±2 mm between panels.\nIf the wall is not structured in the panels described above, the global grid layout should be the same as for the panelled version.\nEach mounting point in the grid has an individual reference comprising the side (sn, dx), the panel number from the bottom, and the alphanumeric grid point within the panel; for example \"dx3 G3\".\nHolds.\nThe two types of holds, 20 big hand holds and 11 small foot holds, are modelled after an official master hold provided by the IFSC. Competition holds are equally coloured in bright red.\nThe shape of the big holds is characterised by four forms protruding in four directions from the central mounting hole. Most prominent is a ball-like structure, clockwise followed by a rounded hill, a pointed long tail opposing the ball, and a shorter pointed tail. The concave shapes between the protruding elements have different well-defined incuts.\nIn the wall topology, the central mounting point is listed with its grid reference, and the vector starting at the central point going to the long tail describes the orientation, by pointing towards a second grid reference.\nThe shape of the small holds is simpler, however the mounting hole is excentric, thus the orientation follows the vector going through the widest protruding side.\nTiming system.\nThe mechanical-electric timing systems consists of a starting pad, recording when the competitor lifts the foot, and a stop device, which is hit with the hand at the top of the wall. The size of the stop device is not precisely specified in the rules, however it covers the holes A/B 9/10 on panel dx10, and its centre has to be 13140 mm above the starting hold, which computes as 15 mm above grid line 10 of dx10.\nManually taking of time was allowed as a backup solution in previous versions of the IFSC rules, but has been removed in 2018.\nBelaying.\nBelaying is performed via a top anchor. While there are methods to quickly take in the rope manually with two belayers, automatic belay systems are increasingly installed, and the world record can only be taken when a certified auto-belay system is being used."

He played college football at the University of Miami.\nEarly years.\nCarter attended Fort Lauderdale High School, where he was a starter at outside linebacker. He accepted a football scholarship from the University of Miami, where he earned a reputation as one of the hardest hitters on the football team. As a freshman in 1985, he was named the starter at strongside linebacker midway through the season, registering 68 tackles (2 for loss), 2 sacks and one forced fumble. As a sophomore in 1986, was named the starter at weakside linebacker, registering 67 tackles (4 for loss) and 2 forced fumbles.\nAs a junior in 1987, he was second on the team with 138 tackles (seventh in school history) and posted 3.5 sacks. He had 19 tackles against the University of Cincinnati. He was also a part of the school's second national championship. \nAs a senior in 1988, he missed the first 2 games with a hamstring and a left knee injury. He regained full strength until midway through the season, recording 88 tackles (second on the team). He led the team with 11 tackles in the 1989 Orange Bowl. He finished his college career with 361 tackles (third in school history), 19 tackles for loss, 6 sacks, 4 passes defensed and 5 forced fumbles.\nProfessional career.\nCarter was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the tenth round (252nd overall) of the 1989 NFL Draft.

        "text": "The women's artistic team all-around competition at the 1952 Summer Olympics was held at Messuhalli, Exhibition Hall II on 22–24 July. It was the fourth appearance of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics format continued to use the aggregation format. Each nation entered a team of eight gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The four apparatus that would become standard (floor, balance beam, uneven bars, and vault) were all used in the same Games for the first time. The team score consisted of the best six individual all-around scores plus the team portable apparatus score.\nNo separate finals were contested.\nFor each individual exercise, five judges gave scores from 0 to 10 in one-tenth point increments. The top and bottom scores were discarded and the remaining three scores averaged to give the exercise total. For the team portable apparatus, eight judges gave scores between 0 and 10, the top two and bottom two scores were discarded, and the remaining four scores were summed and multiplied by 2. Thus, exercise scores ranged from 0 to 10, apparatus scores from 0 to 20, individual totals from 0 to 80, team apparatus scores from 0 to 80, and team all-around scores from 0 to 540. \nFor the vault, each competitor had two tries for each of the compulsory and voluntary vaults with the better score to count. For the other three apparatus exercises, the competitor had the option to make a second try only on the compulsory exercise—with the second attempt counting regardless of whether it was better than the first. For both compulsory and voluntary floor exercises, and voluntary exercises in the non-floor, non-vault apparatuses, only one attempt could be made."

The company's first world championship was the WWE Championship, which was established along with the promotion's creation in 1963 as the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship; it is still active today and is WWE's oldest active title. Whenever the WWE brand extension has been implemented (2002–2011; 2016–present), separate world championships have been created or allocated for each brand.\nWWE currently promotes three men's world championships. Two of them, the WWE Championship and the WWE Universal Championship, are held and defended together as the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship on the SmackDown brand. The third is the World Heavyweight Championship on Raw.\nThis article covers all men's world championships contested in WWE throughout its history, not those acquired by the company and never contested under its banner, although WWE may recognize some titles from outside the company for championship records, such as the NWA World Heavyweight Championship or the AWA World Heavyweight Championship.\nSummary of championships.\nWWE Championship (1963–present).\nThe WWE Championship is the original world heavyweight championship of WWE, currently defended on the SmackDown brand. It was established by the then-World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) on April 25, 1963, as the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship, after Capitol Wrestling Corporation seceded from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) to become the WWWF following a dispute over the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The inaugural champion was Buddy Rogers. Since its inception, the title has undergone many name changes due to company name changes and title unifications. The WWWF was renamed to World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1979 and then World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2002—since April 2011, the company has operated under the trade name of WWE, although the legal name is still the full unabbreviated name.\nThe WWE Championship is the oldest championship currently active in WWE and is presented as being the promotion's most prestigious title. Aside from company name changes that resulted in the championship being renamed accordingly, the most notable name changes were from championship unifications. These included the WWE Undisputed Championship and the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. There is also the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship, which is what the title has been held under since April 2022, but unlike previous unifications, both titles under this undisputed banner have maintained their individual lineages.\nWWE Undisputed Championship (2001–2002).\nThe WWE Undisputed Championship was the result of a unification of the then-WWF Championship and the World Championship (formerly WCW Championship) in December 2001. Earlier that year in March, the WWF acquired World Championship Wrestling (WCW), which shortly after began The Invasion storyline, a war between the WWF and the combined faction of former WCW and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) wrestlers called The Alliance. This culminated at Survivor Series in November where the WWF won The Invasion war, disbanding The Alliance. The WCW Championship was subsequently renamed World Championship. As there was not a need for two world championships, a unification match was scheduled for Vengeance the following month. At the event, \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin defeated Kurt Angle to retain the WWF Championship, while Chris Jericho defeated The Rock for the World Championship. After this, Jericho defeated Austin, unifying the WWF and World Championships, and becoming the first Undisputed WWF Champion; the Undisputed Championship retained the lineage of the WWF Championship while the World Championship was retired.\nAfter the company was renamed to WWE, the championship was renamed Undisputed WWE Championship and then WWE Undisputed Championship. With the introduction of the WWE brand extension in March 2002, the company split its roster into two brands, Raw and SmackDown, where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform. The holder of the Undisputed Championship was the only male wrestler allowed to appear on both brands, as the champion defended the title against challengers from both brands. However, in September 2002, after reigning champion Brock Lesnar signed an exclusive deal to only defend the title on SmackDown, the title dropped the \"undisputed\" moniker, becoming the WWE Championship, while Raw established the original World Heavyweight Championship as its counterpart.\nWWE World Heavyweight Championship (2013–2016).\nThe WWE World Heavyweight Championship was the result of a unification of the WWE Championship and the original World Heavyweight Championship in December 2013. Following the end of the first brand extension in August 2011, both the WWE Champion and World Heavyweight Champion could appear on both \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\". After two years, as there was no longer a need for two world championships in the company, reigning World Heavyweight Champion John Cena made a challenge to reigning WWE Champion Randy Orton to determine WWE's undisputed world champion. Orton subsequently defeated Cena in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match at the pay-per-view on December 15, 2013, to become the WWE World Heavyweight Champion. The WWE World Heavyweight Championship retained the lineage of the WWE Championship while the World Heavyweight Championship was retired.\nAfter Dean Ambrose won the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at Money in the Bank on June 19, 2016, one week later on June 27, the title's name reverted to WWE Championship. After the reintroduction of the brand extension the following month, the title became exclusive to SmackDown and was renamed to WWE World Championship, although it reverted to WWE Championship in December 2016.\nWCW Championship (1991–2001).\nThe WCW World Heavyweight Championship was originally the world championship of World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and later, defended on the then-WWF's programs. The title was established in 1991 when WCW, a member of the NWA, created the title to replace the NWA's world championship and claimed reigning NWA World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair as the inaugural WCW World Heavyweight Champion. Flair's Big Gold Belt simultaneously represented the world championships of both the NWA and WCW until the NWA dropped its recognition of Flair as their champion when Flair left WCW with the Big Gold Belt and joined the WWF. Flair subsequently began appearing on WWF television with the Big Gold Belt, calling himself \"The Real World Champion\"; however, this was never officially recognized as a world championship in WWF.\nIn 1993, WCW seceded from the NWA and grew to become a rival promotion to the WWF. Both organizations grew into mainstream prominence and were eventually involved in a television ratings war, dubbed the Monday Night Wars. Near the end of the ratings war, WCW began a financial decline, which culminated in WWF purchasing WCW in March 2001. As a result of the purchase, the WWF acquired, among other assets, WCW's championships. Thus, there were two world championships in the WWF: the original WWF Championship and the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, which was shortened to WCW Championship upon WWF's acquisition and was eventually renamed the \"World Championship\" in November. The World Championship was then retired when it was unified into the WWF Championship at Vengeance in December 2001, with the WWF Championship becoming the Undisputed WWF Championship. Chris Jericho was the final WCW Champion.\nWorld Heavyweight Championship (2002–2013).\nThe original World Heavyweight Championship was the second world championship to be established by WWE, which occurred in September 2002. After WWE introduced the WWE brand extension in March 2002, the Undisputed Champion was the only male wrestler allowed to appear on both the Raw and SmackDown brands. However, after reigning WWE Undisputed Champion Brock Lesnar signed an exclusive deal to only appear on SmackDown, Raw was left without a world championship. The World Heavyweight Championship was subsequently established and awarded to Triple H, who was originally the number one contender to Lesnar's championship, which dropped the \"undisputed\" moniker.&lt;ref name=\"Raw9/2\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nThroughout the first brand split (2002–2011), the original World Heavyweight Championship and WWE Championship switched brands, usually as a result of the WWE Draft. The brand extension was dissolved in August 2011, allowing the World Heavyweight Champion and WWE Champion to appear on both brands. With no longer a need for two world championships, the World Heavyweight Championship was retired when it was unified into the WWE Championship at TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs in December 2013, with the WWE Championship becoming the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. Randy Orton was the final holder of the original World Heavyweight Championship.\nECW Championship (1994–2010).\nThe ECW World Heavyweight Championship was originally the world championship of Extreme Championship Wrestling, and later, WWE's ECW brand. In 1994, Eastern Championship Wrestling seceded from the NWA and became Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and established the ECW World Heavyweight Championship with WWE recognizing Shane Douglas as the inaugural champion. The championship itself had originally been established as the ECW Heavyweight Championship in 1992 for the previous Eastern Championship Wrestling with Jimmy Snuka as the inaugural champion; however, WWE only recognizes the title history from its change over to Extreme Championship Wrestling. In 2001, the ECW promotion folded due to bankruptcy and WWE bought the assets of ECW in 2003.\nIn June 2006, WWE established a third brand dubbed ECW on which stars from the former promotion and newer talent competed. When ECW's Rob Van Dam won the WWE Championship at ECW One Night Stand, the ECW Championship was subsequently reactivated as the world championship of the ECW brand (and the third concurrently active world championship in WWE) and was awarded to Van Dam, who held both until he lost the WWE Championship to Raw's Edge the following month. The three world championships at one point or another switched brands over the course of the brand extension, usually as a result of the WWE Draft. The ECW brand was disbanded in 2010, subsequently retiring the ECW Championship. The final champion was Ezekiel Jackson.\nWWE Universal Championship (2016–present).\nThe WWE Universal Championship is the third world championship to be established by WWE and is currently defended on the SmackDown brand. Its creation came as a result of the reintroduction of the brand extension in July 2016. On the July 25 episode of \"Raw\", to address the lack of a world championship for the brand since the WWE Championship became exclusive to SmackDown, the Universal Championship was created. Finn Bálor subsequently became the inaugural champion at SummerSlam the following month. The titles would switch brands following the events of the 2019 Crown Jewel pay-per-view. Since April 2022, the title has been held together with the WWE Championship under the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship banner, but unlike previous title unifications, both titles under this undisputed moniker have maintained their individual lineages.\nNXT Championship (2019–2021).\nThe NXT Championship is the top championship of WWE's developmental brand, NXT; however, there was a period of time from 2019 to 2021 in which NXT was regarded as WWE's third brand with the championship regarded as a world championship. In June 2012, WWE established the NXT brand as their developmental territory to replace Florida Championship Wrestling. The NXT Championship was subsequently established and Seth Rollins became the inaugural champion. In September 2019, after years of growth and expansion, the NXT brand became WWE's third major brand when the \"NXT\" program was moved to the USA Network, with the NXT Championship subsequently regarded as a world championship. However, WWE revamped NXT in September 2021 and returned the brand to its original function as a developmental brand, with the title no longer regarded as a world championship.\nUndisputed WWE Universal Championship (2022–present).\nThe Undisputed WWE Universal Championship is the term used by WWE to refer to both the WWE Championship and the Universal Championship being held and defended simultaneously by the same individual. This recognition came as a result of a Winner Takes All match at WrestleMania 38 in April 2022. WWE also billed the match as a championship unification match; however, both titles have maintained their individual lineages despite WWE promoting the undisputed title as one championship.\nAt WrestleMania 38, SmackDown's Universal Champion Roman Reigns defeated Raw's WWE Champion Brock Lesnar to win the latter's title and become recognized as the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion. As the undisputed champion, Reigns was allowed to appear on both brands; as a result of the 2023 WWE Draft, however, he was drafted to SmackDown, thus making both championships under the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship banner exclusive to the brand. A new world title, the World Heavyweight Championship, was created and subsequently designated to Raw.\nOn the June 2, 2023, episode of \"SmackDown\", in celebration of Reigns reaching 1,000 days as Universal Champion, he was presented with a single belt, which features the same \"Network Logo\" design of the individual titles, but with notable differences. It is on a black strap, the WWE logo is encrusted with black diamonds, the background behind the logo is gold with nugget texturing, and the text at the bottom of the plate says \"Undisputed Champion\", while the side plates featured Reigns' logo. His manager Paul Heyman had continued to carry around the standard WWE and Universal Championship belts until the end of July. Cody Rhodes would defeat Reigns at WrestleMania XL Night 2 on April 6, 2024, to win the title, and he has continued to hold the singular Undisputed belt, now with his own logos on the side plates, while continuing the individual lineages of both championships. Following Rhodes's victory, WWE began calling Rhodes the Undisputed WWE Champion, although the Universal Championship is still active.\nWorld Heavyweight Championship (2023–present).\nThe current World Heavyweight Championship is the fourth world championship to be established by WWE, and is currently defended on the Raw brand. Its creation came as a result of Roman Reigns, who at the time held the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. After Reigns became undisputed champion in April 2022, he defended the tandem title across both the Raw and SmackDown brands, but these defenses were infrequent due to the terms of his contract. On the April 24, 2023, episode of \"Raw\", WWE Chief Content Officer Triple H announced that regardless of what brand Reigns was drafted to in the 2023 WWE Draft, he and his undisputed championship would become exclusive to that brand, with Triple H subsequently unveiling the World Heavyweight Championship for the opposing brand. During the draft, SmackDown drafted Reigns, thus the World Heavyweight Championship became exclusive to Raw. Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins became the inaugural champion by defeating AJ Styles in a tournament final at Night of Champions on May 27, 2023.\nChampions.\nCurrent champions.\nThe following list shows the wrestlers that are currently holding all active men's world championships in WWE.\nRetired championships.\nThe following list shows retired men's world championships and the final title holders before the belts were deactivated in WWE.\nInaugural championship holders.\nThe following list shows the inaugural holders for each world championship created and/or promoted by WWE.\nSuperlative reigns.\nTen longest.\nThe following list shows the ten longest world championship reigns in WWE history.\nLongest per championship.\nThe following list shows the longest reigning champion for each world championship created and/or promoted by WWE.\nMost per championship.\nThe following list shows the wrestlers with the most reigns for each world championship created and/or promoted by WWE.\nMost total reigns.\nThe following list shows the wrestlers who have the most world championship reigns in total, combining all titles they have held as recognized by WWE.

It had a \"League of Legends\" team competing in the Campeonato Brasileiro de League of Legends (CBLoL), Brazil's top professional league for the game.\n\"League of Legends\".\nHistory.\nOn 6 October 2017 Flamengo announced the creation if its esports department and its acquisition of the BRCC (Brazilian equivalent of North America and Europe's former challenger series) spot of Merciless Gaming. For its inaugural roster, Flamengo signed top laner Park \"Jisu\" Jin-cheol, jungler Thúlio \"Sirt\" Carlos, mid laner Danniel \"Evrot\" Franco, bot laner Felipe \"brTT\" Gonçalves, and support Eidi \"esA\" Yanagimachi. The team debuted in BRCC 2018 Split 1 and finished as runner-ups, qualifying for the BRCC 2018 Split 2 promotion tournament. Flamengo qualified for the CBLoL after defeating Team oNe eSports 3–2 in the \"access series\" match.\nFlamengo finished as runner-ups in the team's first CBLoL appearance, in both the regular season and playoffs after losing 2–3 to KaBuM! e-Sports in the finals. In preparation for the 2019 CBLoL season, Flamengo replaced its entire roster excluding brTT, signing top laner Leonardo \"Robo\" Souza, jungler Lee \"Shrimp\" Byeong-hoon, mid laner Bruno \"Goku\" Miyaguchi, and support Han \"Luci\" Chang-hoon. The team dominated the regular season of Split 1, losing only a single game to KaBuM. However, in playoffs Flamengo once again fell short, losing to INTZ e-Sports 2–3 in the finals. After placing first once again in the regular season of Split 2, Flamengo managed to defeat INTZ 3–2 to finally win their first CBLoL title. This also qualified the team for play-in stage of the 2019 World Championship.\nFor the 2019 World Championship play-in stage round robin, Flamengo was placed in Group D, along with South Korean team DAMWON Gaming and Turkish team Royal Youth. Despite a good showing against DAMWON Gaming and Royal Youth in the first round robin (the latter of which Flamengo defeated), Flamengo faltered in the second, losing to both teams and tying Royal Youth for second in Group D. After losing the tiebreaker match to Royal Youth, Flamengo was eliminated from the tournament."

All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus, with the scores summed to give a final total. The scores in each of the six apparatus competitions were added together to give individual all-around scores; the top six individual scores on each team were summed to give a team all-around score. No separate finals were contested.\nFor each exercise, four judges gave scores from 0 to 10 in one-tenth point increments. The top and bottom scores were discarded and the remaining two scores summed to give the exercise total. If the two scores were sufficiently far apart, the judges would \"confer\" and decide on a score. Thus, exercise scores ranged from 0 to 20, apparatus scores from 0 to 40, individual totals from 0 to 240, and team scores from 0 to 1,440."

After failing to qualify for the League of Legends Champions Korea (LCK) through Challengers Korea (CK) in the year prior, Griffin was finally able to do so on April 14, 2018, defeating veteran organizations Kongdoo Monster and MVP in the LCK 2018 Summer promotion tournament.\nGriffin's inaugural LCK roster consisted of top laner Choi \"Sword\" Sung-won, jungler Lee \"Tarzan\" Seung-yong, mid laners Jeong \"Chovy\" Ji-hoon and Shin \"Rather\" Hyeong-seop, bot laner Park \"Viper\" Do-hyeon and support Son \"Lehends\" Si-woo. The team quickly rose to the top of the standings, placing second in the regular season and playoffs after losing 2–3 to KT Rolster in the finals. Despite their performance, Griffin was unable to qualify for the 2018 World Championship through championship points, nor through the 2018 Korea Regional Finals, which they were eliminated from by Gen.G.

This placement secured the team a bye to the finals and a spot in the 2019 World Championship, as a series victory would give them a direct qualification as the LCK's first seed, while a series loss would still earn them the most championship points and qualification as the LCK's second seed. SKT ultimately defeated Griffin once again in the finals, with Griffin only managing to take a single game off SKT.\nOn January 5, 2021, the team disbanded."

        "text": "The 2020 US Open was the 140th edition of tennis's US Open and the second Grand Slam event of the year. It was held on outdoor hard courts at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, New York. The tournament was an event run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and was part of the calendars for the 2020 ATP Tour and the 2020 WTA Tour, the top professional men's and women's tennis circuits, respectively.\nHeld during the COVID-19 pandemic, the tournament saw changes in format and personnel compared to previous editions. As a result, withdrawals and opt-outs became a theme of the competition. Defending men's singles champion and world No. 2 Rafael Nadal and No. 9 Gaël Monfils withdrew due to COVID-19 safety concerns, while No. 4 Roger Federer, No. 12 Fabio Fognini, and No. 15 Stan Wawrinka opted out for other reasons. On the women's side, defending singles champion and world No. 6 Bianca Andreescu did not return due to safety concerns, nor did No. 1 Ashleigh Barty, No. 2 Simona Halep, or No. 5 Elina Svitolina, among others. Further, the qualifying rounds of the tournament, in addition to the mixed doubles and juniors draws, were not held due to the pandemic.\nMen's singles world No. 1 Novak Djokovic made headlines by becoming the first top-seeded player to be disqualified from a Grand Slam singles tournament when he was defaulted from his fourth-round match for hitting a ball out of frustration that inadvertently hit a line judge in the throat. Although accidental, Djokovic's actions were deemed to be in violation of a Grand Slam rule regarding ball abuse, and he was disqualified from the tournament.\nDominic Thiem won the men's singles title for his first Grand Slam title. He became the first new Grand Slam men's singles champion since 2014 with his five-set defeat of first-time Grand Slam finalist Alexander Zverev. The women's singles competition was won by Naomi Osaka, who defeated Victoria Azarenka in three sets to capture her second US Open title and third Grand Slam title overall. Osaka arrived to the final wearing a black face mask bearing the name of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old African-American boy shot to death in Cleveland in November 2014. The tournament took place during the George Floyd protests, and Osaka wore similar masks for each of her other six matches, each with a different name of a Black American who died as a result of unjust violence from police or other citizens in the United States.\nTournament.\nThe 2020 US Open was the 140th edition of the tournament and took place at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park of Queens in New York City, United States, where it has been held since 1978. The tournament was held on 17 Laykold hard courts for the first time.\nThe tournament consisted of the men's and women's singles and doubles draws, men's and women's wheelchair singles and doubles draws and a wheelchair quad singles and doubles draw. Both doubles draws were cut to 32 pairs instead of the standard 64. Due COVID protocol decisions made by the New York state government, the USTA and US Open cancelled the draws for qualifying matches, mixed doubles, and junior matches, a decision that was sharply criticized by lower-ranked players, bringing accusations of the tournament \"catering to the top\". The wheelchair events were initially not scheduled to be held, due to a change that would have removed them from the event every four years due to a conflict with the Summer Paralympic Games, but the events were reinstated following the postponement of the 2020 Summer Paralympics to 2021 and criticism from several wheelchair players, notably Dylan Alcott.\nThe tournament used two of the three main show courts at the National Tennis Center – Arthur Ashe Stadium and Louis Armstrong Stadium. Five of the complex's 18 total courts, including Grandstand, the main stadium of the 2020 Western &amp; Southern Open, which was held in New York City instead of its usual Cincinnati venue, were not used for the tournament due to the lack of players.\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe US Open is normally the final major tournament of the year, scheduled during August and September. It was instead the second major of the year due to the cancellation of Wimbledon to June 2021 and the rescheduling of the French Open to late September. In June 2020, it was announced that the event would take place without spectators for the first time in the tournament's history, and the first time in all the Grand Slam tournaments' 143-year history, due to concerns relating to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Players would not be required to quarantine upon arrival, but were subject to regular COVID-19 testing, both prior to arrival and throughout the tournament, and all players and personnel were required to wear a face mask upon entering the grounds except while practicing, training, and working out. To reduce staff, electronic line judges were used on most matches, excluding those held on the two main show courts.\nIn the event a player was deemed a close contact of someone who had tested positive, the United States Tennis Association (USTA) and New York City health officials initially stated that the player could continue play, but would be subject to \"enhanced\" health protocol, including daily testing and restricted access to facilities. On September 5, the USTA announced that health officials in Nassau County, where most players were residing in hotels, had issued 14-day quarantine orders \"for all individuals who had prolonged close contact to a person who previously tested positive\", thus impacting their ability to continue competing in the tournament.\nThe effects of the virus were seen both before and during the tournament. COVID-19 precautions necessitated the cancellation of the qualification matches and the ATP and WTA rankings were the sole metric used to determine entry into the tournament aside from wild cards. Each singles field contained 120 players who gained entry via their ranking and eight wild card entries. This differed from previous years where 16 players in both men's and women's singles entered their draws through qualifying.\nMany players cited safety concerns due to the pandemic as reason to withdraw from the tournament prior to its start, including men's players Rafael Nadal, Gaël Monfils, Stan Wawrinka, Alexei Popyrin, Nick Kyrgios, and Kei Nishikori, and women's players Bianca Andreescu, Simona Halep, Ashleigh Barty, Elina Svitolina, Kiki Bertens, Belinda Bencic, Wang Qiang, and Barbora Strýcová, among others. All in all, the women's singles competition was hit the hardest, as 24 of the top 100 ranked players were absent from the competition. In addition, Benoît Paire was forced to drop out of the tournament due to a positive COVID-19 test. This test also led to the forced withdrawal of the top-seeded women's doubles duo of Tímea Babos and Kristina Mladenovic prior to their second round match due to potential exposure to Paire. Additionally, the men's singles third round match between Alexander Zverev and Adrian Mannarino was delayed for three hours due to a \"collaborative dialogue with health officials\", as a tournament statement phrased it, to determine whether Mannarino could play in the match after his exposure to Paire.\nPlayers.\nThe men's singles competition featured seven players ranked in the top 10 in the ATP rankings at the time of the tournament. World No. 1 Novak Djokovic received the top seed, followed by Dominic Thiem, Daniil Medvedev, and Stefanos Tsitsipas. Djokovic was the clear odds-on betting favorite entering the competition, followed by the other top four seeds. Three previous US Open champions, as well as two previous finalists, were included in the field: Djokovic, a three-time champion; one-time champions Andy Murray and Marin Čilić; and one-time finalists Kevin Anderson, entering as a replacement for Nick Kyrgios, and Daniil Medvedev. Several notable players were missing for non-COVID-19 issues. No. 4 ranked and five-time champion Roger Federer was injured, while No. 12 Fabio Fognini and No. 15 Stan Wawrinka opted out to prepare for the upcoming clay court season. Eight players, all from the United States, entered the draw as wild cards, and three players with a protected ranking, including American player Jack Sock, who replaced Federer.\nThe women's singles tournament was far more affected by withdrawals than the men's singles; of the players ranked in the top ten, only four competed. The top seed in the draw went to world No. 3 Karolína Plíšková, followed by Sofia Kenin, Serena Williams, and Naomi Osaka. Despite being seeded third and fourth, Williams and Osaka entered the tournament as odds-on favorites, having been given equal betting odds to win the title, followed by Plíšková and Kenin. Included in the draw were five previous US Open champions: six-time champion Serena Williams, two-time champion Venus Williams, three-time champion Kim Clijsters, who entered as a wild card, and one-time champions Angelique Kerber and Sloane Stephens. Three previous finalists also competed: Victoria Azarenka, Karolína Plíšková, and Madison Keys. Previous champions Svetlana Kuznetsova and Samantha Stosur were scheduled to compete in the event, but withdrew prior to the competition. Eight players, consisting of Clijsters and seven American players, gained entry to the tournament as wild cards, while five were entered with a protected ranking and an additional two competed as alternates.\nDoubles draws were topped by Juan Sebastián Cabal and Robert Farah on the men's side, and Tímea Babos and Kristina Mladenovic on the women's side. Each draw contained 32 pairs, with four wild card entries.\nEvents.\nMen's singles.\nThe men's singles tournament began on August 31, with Novak Djokovic holding the top seed and top players Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal opting out. Ten seeded players suffered defeats in the first two rounds, including 9th seed Diego Schwartzman, who lost in the first round to Cameron Norrie. The third round eliminated a further eight seeded players, most notably 4-seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, who fell in a fifth-set tiebreak to Borna Ćorić, and 11-seed Karen Khachanov, who lost to Alex de Minaur despite the latter's second-set bagel and subsequent third-set code violation for racket abuse.\nMuch of the action in the tournament's fourth round was overshadowed by controversy surrounding top seed Novak Djokovic's match against 20th seed Pablo Carreño Busta. After losing a point while trailing 5–6 in the first set, Djokovic hit a ball out of frustration that hit a line judge in the throat, which violated a Grand Slam rule regarding ball abuse. Djokovic was defaulted from the match by the tournament referee, marking the first time a top-seeded player had been disqualified from a Grand Slam singles tournament. This disqualification ensured that the top half of the men's singles draw would produce a first-time Grand Slam finalist, and that this tournament would be the first Grand Slam since 2004 without Djokovic, Roger Federer, or Rafael Nadal participating in the semifinal round.\nThe quarterfinals took place on September 8–9. The top two remaining seeds, 2-seed Dominic Thiem and 3-seed Daniil Medvedev, both advanced in straight sets, while 5-seed Alexander Zverev advanced in four sets and 20-seed Pablo Carreño Busta advanced in five. Thiem took his semifinal match over Medvedev in straight sets, while Carreño Busta won the first two sets before losing the final three to Zverev; this was Zverev's first comeback win from two sets down. This set up a final between Thiem, making his fourth Grand Slam finals appearance, and Zverev, making his first; both players were seeking their first Grand Slam title. Zverev, the underdog, jumped out to an early advantage, taking the first and second sets. Thiem battled back in the third and fourth sets. This set up a fifth and final set, which remained close until the end and was eventually won by Thiem in a tiebreak, after four hours and one minute, making Thiem the first new Grand Slam winner in six years. This also marked the first time since Pancho Gonzalez in 1949 that a two-set deficit had been overcome in a US Open final.\nWomen's singles.\nThe women's singles tournament began August 31, with Karolína Plíšková holding the top seed. 29 of the 32 seeded players in the women's singles draw advanced to the second round, the most since the US Open began seeding 32 singles players rather than 16 in 2001. Serena Williams made history in her first round match against Kristie Ahn by becoming the winningest player in US Open history, having won her 102nd match. The second round, however, saw the exit of eleven seeded players, notably 1-seed Plíšková and 5-seed Aryna Sabalenka, who both fell in the second round in straight sets against Caroline Garcia and Victoria Azarenka, respectively. In the third round, 7-seed Madison Keys was forced to retire from her match against Alizé Cornet in the second set after suffering an injury, putting Cornet through to her first-ever US Open round of 16. The fourth round saw three more top-ten seeds fall, notably 2-seed Sofia Kenin, who lost to Elise Mertens, and 6-seed Petra Kvitová, who was upset by Shelby Rogers.\nThis left the third- and fourth-seeded players, Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka, as the top two players headed into the quarterfinals. Each faced an unseeded player, as Williams defeated Tsvetana Pironkova in three sets and Osaka beat Rogers in two. The other two quarterfinals saw 28-seed Jennifer Brady defeat 23-seed Yulia Putintseva, and unseeded Victoria Azarenka upset 16-seed Elise Mertens. This left Azarenka as the only unseeded player in the semifinals, where she met Serena Williams in the first semifinal in Grand Slam history to be contested by two mothers. Azarenka's three-set win put her through to her fifth Grand Slam final. She would be met in the final by Osaka, who defeated Brady in three sets to qualify for her third Grand Slam final. In the final, Azarenka got out to an early lead after taking the first set in dominant fashion. Soon after, Osaka improved her play, and her \"self-described bad attitude\", and won four straight games in the second set to level the match. Osaka was victorious in the final set as well, securing her second US Open title and her third Grand Slam singles title.\nIn each of her seven matches, Osaka entered the stadium wearing a black face mask with the name of a different African-American who died as a result of unjust violence from police or other citizens in the United States, in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and the ongoing George Floyd protests. The seven masks bore the names of Breonna Taylor, Elijah McClain, Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, George Floyd, Philando Castile, and Tamir Rice.\nMen's doubles.\nComing into the men's doubles tournament, the all-Colombian team of Juan Sebastián Cabal and Robert Farah held the top seed. The first round saw the surprising exit of four of the eight seeded pairs, including the 2-seed pair of Łukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo and the 4-seed pair of Filip Polášek and Ivan Dodig. Two more seeded pairs dropped out in the second round, as top-seeded Cabal and Farah faltered, as did the 6-seed German pair of Kevin Krawietz and Andreas Mies.\nThe remaining two seeded pairs met each other in the semifinals, as 8-seed Wesley Koolhof and Nikola Mektić defeated 3-seed Rajeev Ram and Joe Salisbury. The other semifinal saw Jean-Julien Rojer and Horia Tecău fall to Mate Pavić and Bruno Soares; both semifinal matches were decided in two sets. In the final, Pavić and Soares jumped out to a lead as they took the first set 7–5. Koolhoff and Mektić could not respond, and the second set ended in favor of Pavić and Soares, giving them their second and third Grand Slam doubles titles, respectively.\nWomen's doubles.\nEntering the women's doubles tournament, the top seed was awarded to Tímea Babos of Hungary and Kristina Mladenovic of France. While the first round saw the exit of only one of the eight seeded pairs in the tournament (the fifth-seeded pair of Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Zhang Shuai were defeated by Asia Muhammad and Taylor Townsend), the second round saw four such occurrences. The bottom three seeded pairs – 6-seed Shuko Aoyama and Ena Shibahara, 7-seed Victoria Azarenka and Sofia Kenin, and 8-seed Anna-Lena Friedsam and Kateřina Siniaková – were all defeated, and the top-seeded pair of Babos and Mladenovic were disqualified as a result of Benoît Paire's positive COVID-19 test, which required Mladenovic, who had reportedly had close contact with Paire, to quarantine and therefore drop out of the tournament. Their match was awarded on a walkover to Gabriela Dabrowski and Alison Riske, and Babos would later refer to the decision as an \"injustice\", citing the numerous negative COVID-19 tests taken by both of the pair and the clearing of a male athlete in a similar situation the day before.\nThe tournament progressed to the quarterfinals, where the 2-seed pair of Elise Mertens and Aryna Sabalenka and the 4-seed pair of Květa Peschke and Demi Schuurs were both defeated. In the semifinals, Asia Muhammad and Taylor Townsend were defeated by the 3-seed pair of Nicole Melichar and Xu Yifan. The other semifinal saw Anna Blinkova and Veronika Kudermetova fall to Laura Siegemund and Vera Zvonareva; both semifinals were decided in three sets. This set up a final between the pair of Melichar and Xu and the pair of Siegemund and Zvonareva; the latter team took the final in two sets to win the title. This marked the first Grand Slam women's doubles title for Siegemund and the third for Zvonareva.\nWheelchair men's singles.\nThe wheelchair men's singles tournament had two seeded players, 1-seed Shingo Kunieda and 2-seed Gustavo Fernández, and six other unseeded players. In the tournament's opening round, the quarterfinals, Kunieda defeated Nicolas Peifer, and Fernández defeated Stéphane Houdet, both in two sets. The quarterfinals also saw Casey Ratzlaff fall in three sets to Joachim Gérard, and Alfie Hewett defeat Gordon Reid in two.\nIn the semifinals, Kunieda faced Gérard, and bounced back from a first set loss to win in three, while Hewett upset Fernández in three after splitting the first two sets. This set up a final between top-seeded Shingo Kunieda and unseeded Alfie Hewett; the former in his 29th Grand Slam singles final and the latter in his fifth. The match came down to the wire, with each player taking one of the first two sets by a score of 6–3. The third set reached 6–6 and went to a tiebreak, where Kunieda was victorious to win his 24th Grand Slam singles title.\nWheelchair women's singles.\nThe wheelchair women's singles tournament, like the men's competition, was contested by eight players. Two were seeded, 1-seed Diede de Groot and 2-seed Yui Kamiji, while the six others were unseeded. The tournament opened with de Groot defeating Jordanne Whiley and Kamiji defeating Momoko Ohtani, both in straight sets. The other two quarterfinals saw Marjolein Buis eliminate Dana Mathewson in two sets and Angélica Bernal defeat wild card entry Lucy Shuker in three. In the semifinals, both top seeds advanced, with de Groot defeating Buis in three sets and Kamiji beating Bernal in two. This set up a final between the top two seeds, de Groot and Kamiji. The top seeded player, de Groot, did not give Kamiji much of an opportunity for the upset, taking both sets 6–3 and winning her third US Open title.\nWheelchair quad singles.\nThe wheelchair quad singles competition was not played as a traditional tournament bracket; rather, it was played in a round robin-style tournament with the top two finishers moving on to the championship match. Four players took part in the tournament: 1-seed Dylan Alcott, 2-seed Andy Lapthorne, unseeded David Wagner, and wild card entry Sam Schröder. In round robin play, Alcott topped the standings by winning all three of his matches, beating Lapthorne and Schröder in two sets and Wagner in three. Schröder's rather dominant two-set upset of Lapthorne gave him second place and the other berth in the final; Lapthorne finished the round robin with one win and Wagner finished with none.\nThe final was contested by top-seeded Alcott and Schröder. The first set was evenly played by both competitors, but was won by Schröder in a tiebreak. Alcott recovered with a second-set bagel to force the game into a third set, which was won by Schröder in upset fashion, 6–4, for his first US Open title. Schröder's win was especially unlikely considering that Alcott was seeking his eleventh Grand Slam title while Schröder was appearing in a Grand Slam event for the first time.\nWheelchair men's doubles.\nThe wheelchair men's doubles tournament was contested by the same eight players who contested the singles event. The top seed was given to the pair of Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid, with the second seed given to Stéphane Houdet and Nicolas Peifer. Hewett and Reid faced Gustavo Fernández and Shingo Kunieda in the tournament's opening semifinal round, defeating them in two sets, while Houdet and Peifer took down Casey Ratzlaff and Joachim Gérard, also in two. This set up a final between the two top seeds, which was won in two sets by the top-ranked duo of Hewett and Reid.\nWheelchair women's doubles.\nAs with the men's tournament, the wheelchair women's doubles event was contested by the same group of eight players that played in the singles event. The semifinal round proved not to be a challenge for either of the two seeded pairs, as the 1-seed duo of Marjolein Buis and Diede de Groot defeated Angélica Bernal and Dana Mathewson and the 2-seed pair of Yui Kamiji and Jordanne Whiley defeated Momoko Ohtani and Lucy Shuker, both in straight sets. In the final, Kamiji and Whiley were able to outlast Buis and de Groot, winning both sets by a score of 6–3, and earning their eleventh Grand Slam title together.\nWheelchair quad doubles.\nThe wheelchair quad doubles event was the smallest at the tournament, with only four players (the same four that contested the singles event) competing. As a result, there was only one match played to determine the champion. In the first set, underdogs Sam Schröder and David Wagner jumped out to an early lead by winning the first set 6–3, but Dylan Alcott and Andy Lapthorne battled back to force a third with a 6–4 second-set victory. The third set was played as a match tiebreak, which was won 10–8 by Alcott and Lapthorne to secure them the wheelchair quad doubles title.\nPoint distribution and prize money.\nPoint distribution.\nAs a Grand Slam tournament, the points for the US Open are the highest of all ATP and WTA tournaments. These points determine the world ATP and WTA rankings for men's and women's competition, respectively. Due to the smaller draws and the pandemic, all men's and women's doubles players that made it past the first round received half the points of their singles counterparts, a change from previous years where singles and doubles players received the same number of points in all but the first two rounds. In both singles and doubles, women received slightly higher point totals compared to their male counterparts at each round of the tournament, except for the first and last. Points and rankings for the wheelchair events fall under the jurisdiction of the ITF Wheelchair Tennis Tour, which also places Grand Slams as the highest classification.\nThe ATP and WTA rankings were both altered in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both rankings were frozen on March 16, 2020, upon the suspension of both tours, and as a result the traditional 52-week ranking system was extended to cover the period from March 2019 to December 2020, with a player's best 18 results in that time period factoring into their point totals. Points earned from the US Open and other 2020 Tour-level tournaments will be dropped from their point totals after 52 weeks or until that respective tournament is played in 2021. Like other tournaments, each player could only count their best result from either the 2019 or 2020 US Open towards their ranking.\nBelow is a series of tables for each of the competitions showing the ranking points on offer for each event:\nPrize money.\nSeveral days before the tournament began, the prize money pool was announced to be US$53.4 million, a reduction of 6.7% compared to last year's tournament. The prize money for men's and women's singles winners took a large reduction, down 22% to $3 million this year. Prize money at each tier but one of the singles competition saw a reduction in 2020: the winnings for players exiting in the first round rose by 5% but saw no change in second- or third-round exits and saw a decrease in each level past that. Prize money for the men's and women's doubles competitions took big hits as well, as both winning pairs took home 46% less than last year. The total prize pool for the wheelchair competitions was $350,000. In addition to winnings for players, a portion of the prize pool also was given to a relief program funded by the four Grand Slam tournaments, as well as the ITP, ATP Tour, and WTA Tour. A portion of the pool was also designated as being to \"make up for\" the cancellation of qualification tournaments and the reduced size of the competition.\nBroadcasting and viewership.\nIn the United States, ESPN held exclusive rights to the tournament for the sixth year in a row as part of an 11-year, $825 million contract. Tournament matches were viewable on ESPN as well as on ESPN2 and online streaming services ESPN3 and ESPN+. ESPN also held rights to the US Open Series, with the Tennis Channel airing overnight replays of the world feed. Prior to the broadcast of the women's singles final, Mariah Carey premiered the video for her song \"Save The Day\", which was filmed in front of Arthur Ashe Stadium on the grounds of the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center and which features clips of past US Open champions Venus and Serena Williams, Sloane Stephens, and Naomi Osaka. In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, Amazon Prime Video held exclusive rights to the tournament.\nViewership as a whole saw a decline from previous years, drawing only 700,000 viewers due to player opt-outs and competition from other broadcasts on television. Overall ratings suffered a 45% decline; viewership of the men's final dropped 48% while the women's final dropped 43%. The men's final saw the lowest viewership since the tournament was picked up by ESPN, as the match competed with Tom Brady's debut appearance for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the National Football League (NFL), though the women's final charted as the third-highest in the ESPN era, behind the previous two years.\nExternal links.\n "

        "text": "The University of Florida Cycling Club (also known as Team Florida during competitions) is a cycling club and student organization of the University of Florida. The club was established in 1985 as an off-shoot of the Gainesville Cycling Club. The organization has won numerous Southeastern Collegiate Cycling Conference and National Collegiate Cycling Association championships.\nHistory.\nThe first known edition of the University of Florida's Cycling Club was started in the late 1970s by a group of students who began meeting informally for recreational rides. By 1981, they were still meeting, but since almost all had graduated, they changed the group's name to the Gainesville Cycling Club. \nIn Fall 1985, students of Richard Beck's Cycling Class and other racers organized a university sanctioned bicycle racing sports club, Team Florida. From 1986-1988, with significant funding from student government, and sponsor support from various local and national brands and organizations, the team's top riders competed in pro-am United States Cycling Federation (USCF) races throughout the United States, but primarily within the Southeast. Team Florida joined the Southeastern Collegiate Cycling Conference (SECCC) of the National Collegiate Cycling Association (NCCA) in 1989 and began racing in both USCF and NCCA races.\nTeam Florida's first participation in an organized race was a Primo Bike Works' 10 mile time trial starting and finishing at the Hopewell Baptist Church on Wacahoota Road Southwest of Gainesville in late 1985 or early 1986. The first Team Florida win was achieved by Paul Chludzinski in a Citizen's Class criterium in Cocoa Beach in spring 1986. The team's first USCF licensed win was secured by Michael Franovich in a Category IV road race on the Sawgrass Expressway, prior to its July 3, 1986 opening. The first collegiate race win was accomplished by Geoff Rogers in a “B” Category Race at the University of Georgia in 1989.\nAlthough bike races had been held on campus as early as the 1950s, the first race hosted by Team Florida was held in Fall 1986. The six turn USCF sanctioned criterium ran clockwise. It featured a start/finish in front of the Florida Gym on Stadium Road, turned right onto North South Drive (now known as Gale Lemerand Drive) pass the stadium, turned right onto East West Drive (turn no longer exists due to North stadium stands construction), from East West Drive right onto Fletcher Drive, left on what was a road between Pugh and Dauer Halls, right onto Buckman Drive which becomes Stadium Road, and past the Hub before returning to the start/finish. Andy Woodruff, who would eventually ride for Team Florida in the early 1990s, won the Men's Pro, 1,2,3 race. Team sponsored circuit races around Lake Alice were held in 1987 and 1988. The first Stage Race was held in 1989 and featured a downtown twilight criterium and a road race on Dungarvin Road.\nIn 1992, a Team Florida cyclist, Tom Hayes, was killed in an accident while cycling through Paynes Prairie. Team uniforms the following year included a memorial black armband in the cyclist's honor. \nTeam Florida was recognized as the University of Florida's Sports Club of the Year for 2015-2016. In 2017, with student interest in racing declining, Team Florida leadership chose to have the club focus on noncompetitive recreational riding, the team lost its standing as a sports club, and stopped participating in SECCC events. As of October 2019 however, the team had regained its status as a UF Sports Club. Following a lengthy delay associated with the pandemic, Team Florida began competing in SECCC collegiate races again in Fall 2021."

The coefficient is calculated by dividing the total of points accumulated by the number of participating teams.\nParticipation is reserved to teams from associations that have an effective capacity to organise annually their own national championships.

As the riders began the descent of the Col de l'Iseran, the stage was neutralised due to snow, hailstorms, and mudslides rendering the road unsafe near Val-d'Isère on the ascent to Tignes, with times for the general classification being taken at the summit of the Col de l'Iseran. As a result, Bernal, who had been in second place, moved ahead of Julian Alaphilippe, who was nearly two minutes behind Bernal at the summit, and took the lead in that classification.

All sporting points and time bonuses from the diverted route were withdrawn, leaving only those given on top of Val Thorens.\nAs the race travelled through the valley from Albertville to Moûtiers, a group of more than twenty riders established a two and a half minute lead over the peloton. On beginning the climb to Val Thorens, the lead group was reduced to four riders, with a further two riders then joining. With until the finish, Vincenzo Nibali attacked from the lead group. Nibali then held a lead to the finish line.\nStage 21.\n28 July 2019 - Rambouillet to Paris (Champs-Élysées), \nWith still to race, after the peloton had completed a lap of the usual Champs-Élysées circuit, a four-man group comprising Jan Tratnik, Nils Politt, Omar Fraile and Tom Scully achieved a lead of over twenty seconds on the peloton. The group of four's advantage held until they were caught with to the finish. The peloton then headed the race into the finish. Edvald Boasson Hagen opened the sprint in the final , before being passed by Maximiliano Richeze and Niccolò Bonifazio. Dylan Groenewegen and Caleb Ewan then took opposite sides of the road, to pass the other riders."

        "text": "Cairns Basketball Stadium (known commercially as Early Settler Stadium and locally as The Fishtank) is a basketball facility in Cairns, Queensland, Australia. Comprising a centre court, four side courts, a sports science centre, a weights room and multiple locker rooms, the facility currently hosts the Cairns Taipans, Cairns Marlins and Cairns Dolphins, training sessions, the Taipans' NBL pre-season games, and the Marlins' and Dolphins' NBL1 North games. The facility also hosts regular junior and senior competitions run by the Cairns Basketball Association.\nHistory.\nCairns Basketball Stadium was originally opened in 1963 as the home of the Cairns Amateur Basketball Association, which was founded five years earlier in 1958. The facility was first opened as an outdoor court, before the first indoor court was opened in 1986 when the Cairns Marlins joined the Queensland State Basketball League.\nThe usage of the facility was then increased with the introduction of the Cairns Dolphins into the women's QSBL in 1987.\nWhen the Cairns Taipans joined the National Basketball League (Australia) in 1999 the Cairns Convention Centre was announced as their home, however their training sessions were held at Cairns Basketball Stadium. Their continued involvement in the facility attracted multiple expansions from the Government of Queensland and CQUniversity, including the most recent expansion in late 2017/early 2018.\nExpansions.\nAfter the introduction of the Marlins and the Dolphins into the state basketball league, the first expansion for the facility was a seating increase on the centre court in 1994. This was then quickly followed by the air-conditioning of the facility in 1996.\nNearly a decade later there were more expansions, with courts 3 and 4 opened in 2004.\nAcross 2010 and 2011 there were two adjustments to the operations of the stadium, with the car park upgraded in 2010 to enable wheelchair access, and a 20KW solar system installed in 2011.\nIn 2017 a federal government grant allowed Cairns Basketball Stadium to complete a $3 million expansion of the facility, which added a fifth court, improved the landscaping and constructed a teaching facility for CQUniversity to teach sport science on site."

        "text": "England have participated six times at the FIFA Women's World Cup: in 1995, 2007, 2011, 2015, 2019, and 2023. They have reached the quarter-finals in each of their participation and the semi-finals three times, reaching the final in 2023.\n1991 World Cup.\nEngland did not qualify for the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup. The European qualification tournament was the same as the European Championship Qualification. England finished second in their bracket at the group stage and qualified for the quarter-finals. In the quarter-final they lost twice to Germany: 1–4 at home, and 0–2 away. As a result, Germany qualified for the World Cup.\n1995 World Cup.\nFor the World Cup in Sweden, England qualified as the semi-finalist of the European Championship 1995. In the Qualification, England had four wins against Belgium and Slovenia and two goalless draws against Spain. In the quarter-finals, England prevailed with two 2-1 victories against Iceland and was thus qualified for the World Cup. In the semi-finals they lost to Germany 1–4 in the first leg and 1–2 in the second leg.\nThey defeated Canada 3–2 in their first World Cup match. Gillian Coultard scored in the 51st minute by a converted penalty the first World Cup goal for England. After increasing to 3–0 they conceded two late goals. A 2–0 win over Norway followed by a 3–2 victory over Nigeria put England in the quarter-finals as group winners. Here they again lost to Germany 0–3. The result would have been sufficient for England to have qualified for the first women's football tournament at the 1996 Olympic Games in which only the eight best teams of the World Cup could participate. However, because England is not eligible to start at the Olympic Games, Brazil participated as the ninth-best team.\n1999 World Cup.\nFor the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup, for the first time, UEFA set up separate qualifiers. England met the two finalists from 1995, Norway and Germany, as well as the Netherlands. England won only the home game against the Dutch women 1–0 and lost all other games. Thus, England was eliminated at the group stage.\n2003 World Cup.\nIn the qualification for the 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup England again faced Germany and the Netherlands, as well as Portugal. With two wins and two draws, England qualified as a runner-up behind Germany (which qualified directly for the World Cup) for the relegation matches. There they first met Iceland and after a 2–2 in Iceland earned a 1–0 home win to make the relegation final against France. England lost both games 0–1, and thus did not qualify for the World Cup.\n2007 World Cup.\nThe 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup took place for the second time in China. In the qualification England met France, the Netherlands, Austria and Hungary. With six victories – including England's largest ever victory, a 13–0 defeat of Hungary – and two draws, England reached the World Cup for the second time.\nIn the first game of the finals, they met Japan and had a 2–1 lead in the 5th minute of stoppage time when Japan scored a late equalizer. The second game against Germany was a scoreless tie. In the last match against Argentina England won 6–1 and qualified for the quarter-finals, as Japan lost to Germany in a parallel game. In the quarter-finals they held the United States to a 0–0 tie for 50 minutes, but lost 3–0. Thus, England were eliminated in the quarter-finals, as in 1995. However, they were the only team to not lose to the eventual champion Germany. By making the quarter-finals England had actually secured qualification for the women's football tournament at the 2008 Summer Olympics, in which only the three best European teams of the World Cup could participate. However, as England still could not start at the Olympics, Sweden and Denmark, who were both eliminated in the preliminary round, played for this place, and Sweden won.\n2011 World Cup.\nFor the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup in Germany qualifying, England earned seven wins and a draw playing against Spain, Austria, Turkey and Malta for the playoffs of the group winners. In the playoffs, England defeated Switzerland 2–0 and 3–2 to earn a place in the World Cup.\nIn Germany, England was put into a group with Japan, New Zealand and Mexico. In the first game against Mexico, England tied 1:1. England defeated New Zealand 2-1 and Japan 2–0 to take England's first ever group victory at a World Cup. In the quarter-finals England played France. England took the lead in the 59th minute after a scoreless first half, but France equalized two minutes before the end of regular time. In the ensuing overtime, neither team scored, leading to a penalty shoot-out. Although the first French shooter failed and the first three English women were successful, all other French women scored and the last two English women, Claire Rafferty and captain Faye White, did not. England were the only team to have defeated the eventual champion Japan.\n2015 World Cup.\nIn the qualification for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, England prevailed again. Their group included Ukraine, Wales, Turkey, Belarus and Montenegro. England won all 10 games to qualify.\nEngland was assigned to Group F with France, Colombia and, like four years earlier, Mexico.\nIn a close game, they lost 1–0 to France, but followed that with four straight 2–1 wins. First against Mexico, then against Colombia with which they qualified as a runner-up for the knockout round, and then in the first-round playoff match against Norway, thus for the first time winning in a knockout game at the World Cup. In the quarter-finals, where England had never before won, they met host Canada and prevailed 2–1. They thus made the semi-finals for the first time, where they met the defending champion, Japan. England lost with an own goal in injury time, but won the match for third place against Germany for their highest ever finish.\n2019 World Cup.\nIn the qualification for the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in Europe, England met Wales, Russia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and, for the first time, Kazakhstan. England only earned a point in the home game against Wales in a goalless draw. Crucial for the qualification then was a 3–0 victory in front of a record 5,053 spectators against Wales on the penultimate match day.\nEngland had started their qualifications under Mark Sampson, who led them to third place in 2015 and the semi-finals at the European Championship in 2017. In September 2017, he was released after the first game due to various allegations. Mo Marley initially coached the team until former England international Phil Neville took over as coach in January 2018.\nAt the World Cup, the first game was against Scotland, which England won 2–1. Argentina and Japan followed, with a 1–0 result against Argentina and 2–0 against Japan, making England group winners. In the knockout rounds, England won 3–0 against Cameroon, then won against Norway in the quarter-finals, with Ellen White scoring her sixth World Cup goal. In the semi-final White scored again, but the team lost 1–2 to the United States. It was the first FIFA Women's World Cup in full shown on BBC. The previous times BBC aired the World Cup, they mostly aired England's games.\n2023 World Cup.\nThe 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup is the ninth edition of the FIFA Women's World Cup. The tournament is jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand, and is taking place from 20 July 2023 to 20 August 2023.\nEngland were drawn into Group D along with Haiti, Denmark and China.\nEngland played their first group stage match against Haiti on 22 July 2023. They won the match 1–0 thanks to a 29th-minute penalty from Georgia Stanway; her original attempt was saved by the goalkeeper, but the penalty was ordered to be retaken after the VAR determined the Haiti goalkeeper had come off her line prior to the kick.\nSemi-finals.\n "

They have never advanced beyond the group stage.\n1991 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nNew Zealand competed in qualifying for the World Cup in the People's Republic of China. Competing at the 1991 OFC Women's Championship, New Zealand took out the Oceania title by goal difference over Australia as the Australians could only score eight goals in the final match against Papua New Guinea where they needed sixteen goals to qualify through.\nCompeting in Group A, New Zealand were drawn to take on China (host nation), Denmark and Norway. In New Zealand opening game at Guangzhou, they would lose 3–0 to Denmark. The following match which was held at the Guangdong Provincial Stadium saw a 4–0 defeat to Norway before losing to China 4–1 in the final group match at Foshan. During this game Kim Nye scored the first World Cup goal for New Zealand in the 65th minute.\n2007 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nNew Zealand next appearance at the FIFA Women's World Cup was at the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup after they had finished second in the previous three OFC Women's Championships to Australia who would qualify through to the World Cup on each occasion. After Australia left the OFC to join the AFC in late June 2005, New Zealand was left as the biggest team in Oceania. At the 2007 OFC Women's Championship in Papua New Guinea, New Zealand took out their second title after scoring 21 goals in the three matches that were played against Tonga (6–1), Samoa (8–0) and Papua New Guinea (7–0). Kirsty Yallop and Nicola Smith was the top goalscorers of the tournament with four goals each.\nAt the World Cup, New Zealand were drawn in Group D with host nation China, Denmark and Brazil. New Zealand first match of the group was against Brazil. Playing at Wuhan, Brazil would have four different goalscorers as New Zealand would lose 5–0 in their opening game. This was followed up by consecutive 2–0 defeats to Denmark, and China which meant that for New Zealand they would leave the competition without a goal.\n2011 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nAt the following World Cup which was held in Germany, New Zealand once again qualified through as the champions of the OFC Women's Championships. After scoring thirty-one goals in the group stage against Vanuatu, Cook Islands and Tahiti, they finished top of the group. In the semi-final they defeated the Solomon Islands 8–0 before defeating Papua New Guinea 11–0 in the final.\nAt the World Cup, New Zealand was drawn in Group B with England, Japan and Mexico. The first match in the 2011 World Cup was against Japan in Bochum. After conceding the opening goal in the sixth minute from Yūki Nagasato, New Zealand equalized from a goal from Amber Hearn which was the first goal in twenty years. Aya Miyama scored the winner in the 68th minute to give Japan a 2–1 win. Their following match against England saw New Zealand take the lead in the 18th minute from a Sarah Gregorius goal. Two goals in the second half from Jill Scott and Jessica Clarke gave England the three points.\nThe final match of the group saw New Zealand fall behind early with two goals in thirty minutes with Stephany Mayor and Maribel Domínguez securing those goals. For New Zealand, two late goals in the last few minutes from Rebecca Smith and Hannah Wilkinson gave New Zealand their first World Cup point after eight consecutive defeats from eight matches.\n2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nNew Zealand once again made through to the World Cup with the tournament being held in Canada. At the 2014 OFC Women's Nations Cup, New Zealand would take the out their third consecutive Oceania title after they scored thirty goals against Tonga (16–0), Papua New Guinea (3–0) and the Cook Islands (11–0). Amber Hearn was the leading top goalscorer of the tournament with seven goals.\nAt the World Cup, New Zealand were drawn in Group A with host Canada, China and World Cup newcomer Netherlands. In the opening match held at Edmonton, the Netherlands scored their first World Cup goal from midfielder Lieke Martens in the 33rd minute which was the difference between the two teams on the day. Their following match also in Edmonton saw them take on the hosts. After a thirty minute delay due to a soggy pitch, the match ended in a 0–0 draw with the best opportunity being in the opening half when Amber Hearn couldn't convert a penalty as it hit the crossbar.\nWith a win needed in the final match of the group, they took on China in the final match held at Winnipeg. Rebekah Stott scored the opening goal in the 28th minute before a penalty in the 41st minute was converted by Wang Lisi despite replays showing the ball ricocheted off the chest instead of the hand. Wang Shanshan gave China the lead after a mistake from keeper Erin Nayler meant that Shanshan could loft the ball high and into the net. Hannah Wilkinson scored New Zealand's second four minutes later but they couldn't breakthrough the deadlock with the result ending in a two all draw.\n2019 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nThe following edition which was held in France saw New Zealand once again qualify through to the World Cup. This was mainly from their new head coach in Tom Sermanni who was signed as head coach in October 2018. Competing at the 2018 OFC Women's Nations Cup which was also the qualifier for the 2020 Summer Olympics, New Zealand comfortably qualified through the group stage as group winners with 27 goals in three matches against Tonga (11–0), Cook Islands (6–0) and Fiji (10–0). It was during the Fiji match that Ria Percival became the leading international player for New Zealand with their 133rd cap passing Abby Erceg. This was followed by the semi-final win with a 8–0 win over New Caledonia, they would get another 8–0 win in the final against Fiji to book their fifth World Cup appearance.\nAt the World Cup, New Zealand was placed in Group E with two opponents from the previous World Cup in Canada and the Netherlands with the third opponent being Cameroon who was debuting at the tournament. In the opening match against the Netherlands at Le Havre, a late 92nd minute goal from Dutch midfielder, Jill Roord gave the Netherlands the three points. This was after New Zealand was simply outplayed in the first half but held firm with a draw at the break. The following match against the Canadians saw New Zealand being dominated by Canada as New Zealand only had two shots for entire game compared to twenty-two from Canada, two of those being goals from Jessie Fleming and Nichelle Prince which saw New Zealand needing to win against Cameroon in the final game. The final match was held at Montpellier and it would be the Ajara Nchout difference with the Cameroon player scoring two goals in the match to give Cameroon the victory. This was despite an own goal Aurelle Awona in the 80th minute which gave New Zealand a shot at a win but it wasn't to be with Cameroon advancing as one of the best third place teams.\n2023 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nNew Zealand are co-hosting the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup alongside Australia, the Football Ferns automatically qualified as co-host."

        "text": "The United States women's national soccer team is the most successful women's national team in the history of the Women's World Cup, having won four titles, earning second-place once and third-place finishes three times. The United States is one of five countries including Germany, Japan, Norway, and Spain to win a FIFA Women's World Cup. (The United States won in China in 1991, in the United States in 1999, in Canada in 2015, and in France in 2019). The United States was also the only team that played the maximum number of matches possible in every tournament until they got eliminated in the round of 16 in 2023.\n1991 World Cup.\nFor the first World Cup Women's Championship, the United States qualified as the North and Central America Qualifications. At a tournament in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, they met in the first round Trinidad and Tobago, Mexico, and Martinique (who, as a non-FIFA member, could not qualify for the World Cup). The U.S. prevailed with three wins, scoring 34–0 goals. In the semifinals, hosts Haiti were defeated 10–0 in the final Canada, which also reached the final without conceding, 5–0. Thus, the U.S. qualified as the only CONCACAF representative for the World Cup finals.\nIn China, the team met Sweden, Brazil, and Japan in the group stage. On November 17, 1991, they played in Panyu their first World Cup match and won against Sweden 3–2. Carin Jennings scored the first two World Cup goals for the United States. After a 5-0 win over Brazil and a 3-0 win over Japan, the group winners reached the quarter-finals. This was followed by a 7-0 victory over the Republic of China and a 5-2 draw against Germany in the semifinals, Carin Jennings led the US with a \"flawless\" hat-trick. In the final then vice-European Champion Norway was the opponent and here it was Michelle Akers, who secured the 2–1 victory with two goals and was also the top scorer with a total of 10 goals. Carin Jennings was awarded the Golden Ball for Best Player of the Tournament.\n1995 World Cup.\nUnlike the men's World Cup, where the defending champion was automatically qualified until 2002, the defending champion had to qualify for the women's second World Cup. In the Qualification Tournament in Montreal, the U.S. impressively scored four wins and 34 goals and 1 conceded. Opponents were Canada, who also finished second as the CONCACAF teams now have two starting slots, Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica.\nIn Sweden, in the first group match, the United States faced People's Republic of China and played to a 3-3 draw. The second game was a 2-0 victory over Denmark and the final group game was a 4–1 victory over Australia. Both the U.S. and China had a 2-1 record, but the U.S. were group winners by virtue of the better goal difference. In the quarterfinals, the U.S. met Japan and won 4–0, setting up a semifinal match with Norway that was a rematch of the previous World Cup final. This time, the Norwegians prevailed, winning the game 1–0 and going on to win the final match. This was the first World Cup loss for the United States. In the match for third place, the U.S. played China again and this time won 2–0.\n1999 World Cup.\nFor the third World Cup, the United States qualified as host. In 1996, the United States had won the first women's football tournament in the Olympic Games and was therefore a favorite for the World Cup title. They also lived up to their role in the first games. In the first group match they met Denmark and won 3-0. In the second match, Nigeria was defeated 7-1 and in the third match Korea DPR 3-0. In the quarter-finals, European Champion Germany was defeated 3–2 and Brazil was defeated in the semi-final 2–0. The final in Los Angeles against China then took place in front of a record crowd of 90,185 spectators. No women's football match recognized by FIFA had attracted more spectators.\nThe final match was the first scoreless one, and after 120 minutes it went to a penalty shootout for the first time. While all five U.S. shooters were successful, Liu Ying couldn't get the ball past Briana Scurry. Brandi Chastain, after being the last shooter to succeed, pulled off her jersey and knelt in her black sports bra on the field, exulting in the U.S. victory.\n2003 World Cup.\nThe 2003 World Cup was originally to take place again in China PR. Due to the SARS epidemic, the tournament was temporarily relocated to the United States. Thus, the World Cup took place for the second time in the United States, making the U.S. the only nation to host two consecutive World Cup tournaments. As hosts, the U.S. were again automatically qualified, but they still took part in the qualifying 2002 CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup, which they won with a Golden goal 2-1 against Canada. With this victory in the finals, they would have automatically qualified for the World Cup.\nIn the group stage of the World Cup they met Sweden in the first game and won 3–1. This was followed by a 5–0 win against Africa Champion Nigeria and a 3–0 win over North Korea. As a group winner, the United States then met Norway and won 1–0. In one of the best women's World Cup games, they then lost in the semi-final against Germany 0–3, the last two goals coming in stoppage time. In the match for 3rd place, Canada was defeated 3-1. Germany won their first World Cup title with a Golden goal by Nia Künzer in the final.\n2007 World Cup.\nIn 2007, the World Cup took place for the second time in the People's Republic of China. The CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup 2006 again served as a qualifier, with the U.S. only having to intervene in the semifinals. With a 2–0 win against Mexico, they qualified for the World Cup and the final. They won 2–1 against Canada, as they had four years earlier, but only by a foul penalty in the 120th minute.\nThe U.S. traveled to the World Cup as Olympic Champions. In China, they had the same preliminary round opponents as four years earlier, but started with a 2–2 draw against North Korea. A 2–0 victory over Sweden was followed by a defeat of Nigeria 1–0, on a goal by Lori Chalupny in the first minute against the Africa Champion. The quarter-final against England was won 3–0, with all three goals coming in the second half. Coach Greg Ryan replaced Hope Solo with Briana Scurry, the only goalkeeper in the past 10 World Cup matches, for the semifinals against Brazil which the U.S. lost 0–4. Solo accused the coach in an interview to have made a mistake with the change, saying she herself could have prevented the goal-scoring. Although Solo apologized a little later for her remarks, she was not used in the match for third place, which was won against Norway 4–1, nor did she join the team on the journey home. Solo was only appointed back into the squad of the U.S. national team in early 2008 by coach Pia Sundhage. Semi-final winner Brazil then lost in the final to defending champion Germany, who succeeded as the first team in women's soccer to defend their title, and the first team to not concede a goal in the World Cup.\nGroup B.\nThe four teams were also paired in the same group in 2003.\n2011 World Cup.\nFor the World Cup in Germany, the U.S. qualified only by the detour of the intercontinental playoffs. Previously, in the 2010 CONCACAF Women's World Cup Qualifying, which again served as a qualifier, the US won the preliminary round with three wins against Haiti (5: 0), Guatemala (9: 0) and Costa Rica (4: 0). But then a game was lost in the Gold Cup with a 1–2 defeat by Mexico in the semi-final. Although victorious in the third-place match against Costa Rica by a score of 3-0, this was not sufficient for direct qualification. Instead, two games against Italy had to be contested, both of which were won 1–0 (aggregate 2–0) in favor of the United States.\nThe U.S. team traveled to Germany again as Olympic Champions. In the group stage, as in the two previous tournaments North Korea and Sweden were again the opponents, and also World Cup newcomer Colombia. For the first time, the U.S. team was coached by a foreigner, the Swedish Pia Sundhage, who had previously led the U.S. team in 2008 for their third Olympic victory. After two wins against North Korea (2–0) and Colombia (3–0), the United States lost to Sweden 2–1. Thus, the United States were only second in the group standings and met South America Champion Brazil in the quarterfinals. The U.S. took the lead in the second minute with Daiane's own goal, but had to settle for a penalty kick in the 68th minute when Marta converted the penalty. The Brazilians were fortunate, though Hope Solo held the first penalty from Cristiane Rozeira, but referee Jacqui Melksham let them repeat because one U.S. player had run into the penalty area too early. On the second attempt Marta was ultimately successful. In addition, the U.S. was now outnumbered, as Rachel Buehler had been given a [red card]. The score remained until the end of regular time at 1–1, which forced an extension. In this Marta scored after just two minutes, giving Brazil a 2–1 lead. In the second minute of extra time, Abby Wambach managed a 2–2 equalizer after a long Megan Rapinoe cross.\nThe semifinal match was against France, in their first World Cup appearance, and the U.S. won 3-1 moving them for the third time into the final. This game pitted the U.S. against Japan, who had won their first-ever victory in the quarter-finals with a surprising victory against the hosts (and two-time defending champions) Germany. The United States had never lost to Japan before and were therefore a favorite. After a goalless first half, Alex Morgan made it 1–0 in the 69th minute. Japan was able to equalize in the 81st minute, which forced an extension. Again, the Americans took the lead; Homare Sawa, however, scored three minutes from the end of extra time with her fifth tournament goal, making her the top scorer of the tournament. In stoppage time Azusa Iwashimizu received the red card because of an emergency brake, but it remained at 2–2, so that for the second time the penalty shoot-out had to decide the world title. Although Japanese goalkeeper Ayumi Kaihori was only 170 centimeters tall, she held two penalties against the U.S., and also Carli Lloyd shot over the goal, while three Japanese women turned and only one failed. Japan thus became the first football world champions from Asia.\n2015 World Cup.\nIn the Qualification, which was again hosted by the CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup 2014, the U.S. was again the winner. In the first round, the first game against Trinidad and Tobago was a narrow 1–0 victory; the next two matches were more decisive, with defeats of Guatemala and Haiti (5–0 and 6–0). In the semi-final, the U.S. had a 3–0 win over Mexico, and with the 6–0 win over Costa Rica in the final, the U.S. exceeded their own 1991 record for goals in a final.\nThe U.S. group included Nigeria, Sweden and Australia. The group was considered the most balanced of the World Cup; it was the only one with four teams that at least reached the semi-finals in their last continental championship matches.\nFor the World Cup, the United States traveled again as Olympic Champions. In the first game, the U.S. women won 3–1 against lively Australians, followed by a goalless draw against Sweden and in the last group match, Nigeria, Abby Wambach, who scored her final goal, secured the 1–0 victory over the Africa champion with her 14th goal. In the round of 16 against Colombia, Wambach missed her penalty kick, but her teammates Alex Morgan and Carli Lloyd (penalties) scored to secure the entry into the quarter-finals.\nIn the quarter-final match, the U.S. dominated the game but missed many chances while the Chinese shot only once on the U.S. goal in the whole game. As in 1999, the game went without goals in the second half, but six minutes after the restart Carli Lloyd scored to ensure a 1–0 victory in their 200th international match. In the semifinals, the two two-time World Champions United States and Germany met, and the U.S. prevailed with 2–0 to become the first team to reached the finals for the fourth time. The final match was a repeat of 2011 against Japan, who had reached the finals with six wins. In this game Christie Rampone became the oldest World Cup player in history. After just five minutes, the U.S. led 2–0, after 16 minutes it was 4–0, so the game was virtually decided. Japan was able to score once in the first half, and shortly after the break the U.S. helped them with an own goal, but quickly recovered to score another insurance goal, for a final score of 5-2. The United States became the first team to win a third World Cup title.\n2019 World Cup.\nIn the Qualification, which was again hosted by CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup 2018, the U.S. qualified to reach the finals. In the preliminary round, the first game against Mexico was won 6–0, then Panama and Trinidad and Tobago were beaten just as clearly (5–0 and 7–0). In the semifinals, the U.S. won a 6–0 game against Jamaica, and in the final a 2–0 victory against Canada.\nAt the World Cup, the Americans won their first match with a 13–0 record victory against Thailand, with Alex Morgan being the second player to score five goals in one match, and the team scoring a total of 10 goals in the second half. They won 3–0 against World Cup debutant Chile, scoring all three goals in the first half. In the last group game they met Sweden for the sixth time in a World Cup group match and won 2–0. As Group F winners, the Americans advanced to the round of 16 against Spain, who reached the knockout round for the first time at their second World Cup. Two penalties were converted by Megan Rapinoe as the U.S. won 2–1. In the quarter-finals they met France and thus for the first time in a World Cup, they played a match against the hosts. They again won 2–1, with Rapinoe again scoring twice. Thus, the U.S. met England in the semifinals, and achieved another 2-1 win. Goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher secured the victory by saving a penalty shot in the 84th minute. Their title was defended in the final with a 2–0 victory against European champions the Netherlands, giving the United States a record fourth World Cup title.\n2023 World Cup.\nFollowing the 2019 World Cup, head coach Jill Ellis was replaced by Macedonian Vlatko Andonovski, who would be attempting to lead the U.S. to an unprecedented third consecutive World Cup title. The 2023 Women's World Cup saw Australia and New Zealand become the first 2 nations to co-host a Women's World Cup, and also featured an expanded field, increasing from 24 to 32 teams. Qualification was determined by the 2022 CONCACAF W Championship, which was held in Mexico. The U.S. defeated each of its group stage opponents: Haiti, Jamaica, and the hosts, securing direct qualification to the World Cup. They then went on to defeat Costa Rica in the semifinals, and a 1-0 defeat of reigning Olympic gold medalists Canada in the final clinched them direct qualification to the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.\nAt the World Cup, the U.S. was drawn into Group E, meaning all of their group stage matches would be played in New Zealand. In their first match against debutants Vietnam, a first half brace by Sophia Smith along with a second half goal by Lindsey Horan ensured a comprehensive 3-0 victory, with Vietnam failing to record a single shot against a stout U.S. defense. Game 2 was a rematch of the previous World Cup final as the U.S. faced the Netherlands. The Americans fell behind early after Jill Roord opened the scoring for the Dutch in the 17th minute, but the U.S. equalized in the second half after Horan scored from a header off a corner kick. The game would finish in a 1-1 draw. The third and final group stage game came against Portugal, who were also making their Women's World Cup debut. Despite being heavy underdogs, Portugal had the better of the possession for much of the game, limiting the amount of chances created by the U.S. attack. The Americans came within inches of being eliminated in the group stage for the first time in their history when, in the second minute of second half added time, a shot from Portugal's Ana Capeta struck the post but did not go in. A 0-0 draw meant that the U.S. would qualify for the round of 16 as Group E runners-up behind the Netherlands. Their 5 point total was the lowest ever achieved by the U.S. at a Women's World Cup, despite the inaugural 1991 edition only awarding 2 points for a win instead of 3. They lost to Sweden on penalties in the round of 16, achieving their worst-ever World Cup result and leaving without a medal for the first time.\nFIFA World Cup record.\nThe team has participated in every World Cup through 2023 and failed to reach the semifinals only in 2023.\nRecord by opponent.\nOn July 9, 2016, Hope Solo earned her 100th international shutout, 150th career win, and 197th cap in a friendly game against South Africa at Soldier Field, Chicago, Illinois. This made Solo the first female goalkeeper to achieve 100 shutouts in international competition."

        "title": "1977–78 Boston University Terriers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1977–78 Boston University Terriers men's ice hockey team represented Boston University in college ice hockey. In its 5th year under head coach Jack Parker the team compiled a 30–2–0 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the fifth consecutive season and thirteenth all-time. The Terriers defeated Boston College 5–3 in the championship game at the Providence Civic Center in Providence, Rhode Island to win their third national championship.\nThis was the first championship team to play more games on the road than at home.\nSeason.\nWinning.\nAfter four consecutive ECAC tournament championships, and nothing to show for it at the national level, Boston University came out of the gate swinging. Backstopped by the tandem of Jim Craig and team co-captain Brian Durocher, BU walloped Merrimack in the season opener before starting their conference schedule. The first four ECAC matches were all close affairs, with only one having more than a one-goal margin, but the Terriers managed to win each game.\nBoston University did not participate in a holiday tournament during the season, opting instead to play three non-conference games against Air Force and Michigan State where they, again, won each match. After a 6–5 win over rival Cornell the Terriers began an arduous road schedule; in a ten-game span over 4 weeks the Terriers would play eight games on the road. BU struggled most nights to dominate what would normally be inferior competition but the Terriers continued to win night in and night out. By the time the Beanpot rolled around in early February BU remained unbeaten and possessed a sparkling 19–0 record. Their 15–0 conference record all but guaranteed the Terriers first place in the ECAC tournament and when they throttled arch-rival Boston College 12–5 in the Beanpot semis the Terriers looked on track to join 1969–70 Cornell win an undefeated season.\nFirst Loss.\nTwo days after a second victory over the Eagles, BU headed to New Haven, Connecticut where they were finally burned by playing all those close games. Yale managed to score 7 goals on BU, the third time that the Terriers had allowed that many goals, but Boston University only netted 5 and suffered their first loss of the season, ending a 21-game winning streak. After two more close wins BU punished Harvard 7–1 in the Beanpot championship and won their 10th title. The Terriers ended the regular season three days later with yet another one-goal victory to finish with the best record in program history at 25–1.\nECAC tournament.\nBU served as the host for their quarterfinal meeting with New Hampshire and despite the Wildcat's 8th-seed UNH possessed a better offence than Boston University. New Hampshire demonstrated their scoring prowess throughout the game but the Terriers were just a little bit better on the night and managed to pull out a 6–5 win in overtime. Their semifinal meeting against Providence, however, could not have gone worse. Needing just one more win to guarantee a spot in the NCAA tournament, BU's offense faltered and scored once, only the second time all season where they had failed to record at least 4 goals. Providence meanwhile pumped five pucks into the Terriers' net and skated to a relatively easy victory.\nThe loss dealt a serious blow to BU's title hopes but it did not end them entirely. Boston University's first champion in 1971 came as a result of being chosen over conference runner-up Clarkson and in the meantime the NCAA selection committee had given itself the ability to add up to four additional teams to the tournament if they so desired. However, before any of that would occur, BU would have to take care of business in the third-place game against Brown. BU's 8–4 win pushed its record to 27–2 and with their 21-game streak to start the season the selection committee did award Boston University with an at-large bid, the only time in the 4-year history of the then-format where the committee invited an additional team.\nNCAA tournament.\nNot wanting to waste the opportunity given to them, Boston University defense showed up to play in the tournament. In their First Round meeting, a rematch with Providence, BU found itself on the road in front of a very hostile crowd. While the Friars were hoping to even the season series the Terriers ended Providence's tournament with a 5–3 victory. The championship rounds of the tournament were being held down the road at the Providence Civic Center so BU had a very short distance to travel. Waiting for them was WCHA co-champion and defending national champion Wisconsin. Despite possessing the top two scorers in the nation, Wisconsin was unable to bring their offense to bear and BU finally made it to a championship game after four years of futility.\nIn the title tilt BU faced off against BC who had lost the previous three meetings by a combined score of 28–13. The Eagles gave themselves no favors when Joe Augustine took a penalty just 9 seconds into the game, allowing BU's leading scorer Mark Fidler to open the scoring with a power play goal 38 seconds in. Boston College responded with two goals in the middle of the period but BU regained the lead with two of their own before the first 20 minutes had ended. In the most penalty-filled contest in NCAA history (22 minor penalties in total) Tony Meagher scored a short-handed goal to give BU a 3–2 lead and then got his second score ten minutes later to build the first two-goal cushion of the night. Fidler notched his own second goal one minute into the third and Jim Craig turned aside 22 of BC's 23 shots in the final 40 minutes to give Boston University its third national championship.\nAwards and honors.\nFuture olympian Jack O'Callahan was named as the Tournament MOP and joined on the All-Tournament Team by teammates Dave Silk, Dick Lamby and Mark Fidler. No Terrier was named to the AHCA All-American East Team despite their stellar record but head coach Jack Parker received his second Spencer Penrose Award as the national coach of the year.

        "text": "The 2019 Wimbledon Championships Men's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the men's singles tournament at the 2019 Wimbledon Championships. After 4 hours and 57 minutes, first seed Novak Djokovic defeated second seed Roger Federer in five sets to win the title in a repeat of the 2014 and the 2015 Wimbledon finals. It was the longest Wimbledon final in history, and the last major final of Federer's career.\nOverview.\nNovak Djokovic was the defending champion and successfully defended his title, defeating Roger Federer in 4 hours and 57 minutes, 7–6(5), 1–6, 7–6(4), 4–6, 13–12(3), the longest singles final in Wimbledon history and the third longest Grand Slam final in history behind the 2012 Australian Open final (which Djokovic also won) and the 2022 Australian Open final.\nDjokovic became the first man since Bob Falkenburg in the 1948 Wimbledon Championships to win the title after being championship points down, having saved two when down 7−8 in the fifth set with Federer serving. Djokovic also became the first man since Gastón Gaudio at the 2004 French Open to save championship points in order to win a Grand Slam title, and the first time that any singles player, male or female, has saved a championship point to win a Grand Slam title since 2005 Wimbledon. Djokovic became the second man and third singles player overall to win multiple Grand Slam titles after saving match point during the tournament, after Rod Laver and Serena Williams; his previous time doing it was also against Federer, that being in the 2011 US Open semi-finals, after which he defeated Rafael Nadal in the final.\nThe match is also notable for the fact that Federer lost despite statistically outplaying Djokovic in almost every category (see table below): having a better first- and second-serve percentage, more aces, fewer double-faults, more winners, more breaks of serve and a more efficient break-point conversion rate, more points won when returning serve and at a higher efficiency, and won a higher total number of points and service games. Besides the final scoreline, the only statistical categories Djokovic won were having fewer unforced errors and all the tiebreaks that occurred.\nThis was the second Wimbledon where a final set tie break rule was introduced. Upon reaching 12–all in the fifth set, a classic tie break would be played. The men's singles final was the first final, as well as the first singles match, in which the new rule came into effect, with Djokovic winning the tiebreak 7−3. This match was named the greatest men's tennis match of the 2010s by Tennis Magazine. A 2022 rule change meant that all tennis matches that are tied at six-all in the deciding set, even the Olympics, are decided by a ten-point tiebreak (instead of the usual seven-point tiebreak).\nOfficials.\nThe Chair Umpire was Damian Steiner of Argentina.\nStatistics.\nSource:"

The 18-hole club, opened for play in January 1962 was built (over a 168-acre stretch of sand and slash pine) by golf course architect Joseph L. Lee, \"Gentleman Joe\" (a Wilson protege). Pine Tree was remodeled by Lee, in 1990, Ron Forse in 1997 and Bobby Weed in 2005. The club built two guest houses. One was named after founder member Louis Gumpert. The other was called \"The Wilson\" where Wilson stayed when he died in 1965.\nArnold Palmer and Dow Finsterwald, both professionally connected with clubs near by, applied for conventional, private memberships. Popular quotes include, \"The best course I have ever seen.\"—Ben Hogan, \"A truly great course.\"—Jack Nicklaus, \"The greatest course I have ever played.\"—Ruth Jessen, \"Dick Wilson's greatest work of all.\"—Gardner Dickinson. \nLegends such as Sam Snead, Tommy Armour, Louise Suggs, Mickey Wright and JoAnne Carner have called Pine Tree their home winter club.

Listed at and , he plays the small forward and shooting guard positions.\nArmstrong, who is a native of Flint, Michigan, played basketball for several high schools, spending his final two year at Bella Vista Prep. A consensus four-star recruit, he drew interest from several major NCAA Division I programs and committed to Arizona before choosing to immediately play professionally in the NBL.\nEarly life.\nArmstrong grew up in the West Side of Flint, Michigan. He often played basketball with others in his neighborhood or shot around in his driveway. He is mentored by his guardian Tim Jones, who is also from Flint.\nHigh school career.\nAs a freshman at Carman-Ainsworth High School in Flint, Armstrong began playing basketball under head coach Jay Witham in the 2015–16 season. After averaging 12.6 points per game through his first six games, he was considered one of the best freshmen in Michigan, garnering attention from prep school programs. Armstrong led his team to the regional semifinals and a 20–4 record, averaging 16 points, 5.5 rebounds, and two steals per game. He earned Class A All-State first team honors from the Associated Press and Class A All-State honorable mention recognition from the \"Detroit Free Press\" and \"The Detroit News\".\nEntering his 2016–17 sophomore year, Armstrong transferred to Joseph Wheeler High School, a school in Marietta, Georgia with a nationally recognized basketball program. He joined the team with E. J. Montgomery, one of the top recruits in the 2018 class. However, in late November, before playing a game for Wheeler, Armstrong moved to Davison High School in Davison, Michigan. He made the decision following his mother's relocation to the Davison district. Armstrong was forced to sit out his sophomore season after being ruled ineligible by the Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA). While being sidelined, he dropped in national rankings and attracted decreasing attention from college programs.\nAs a junior in 2017–18, Armstrong transferred to Bella Vista College Preparatory School in Scottsdale, Arizona. The Bella Vista Prep basketball team, which was newly formed to replace Aspire Academy, played a national schedule and was coached by former Hillcrest Prep coach Kyle Weaver.

The ground opened in 1956 and the first Test match was played on the ground the same year. The ground's first One Day International (ODI) was played in 1992 and its first Twenty20 International played in 2005. The first women's international played on the ground took place in 1960 and it has hosted women's Test, ODI and T20I cricket. The 2003 Cricket World Cup Final was played on the ground and it hosted matches in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, including the first match of the tournament and the final.\nIn cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five-for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement. This article details the five-wicket hauls taken on the ground in official international Test matches, One Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals.\nThe first five-wicket haul taken in an international match on the ground was taken by England bowler Trevor Bailey who took five wickets for the cost of 20 runs (5/20) against South Africa in the ground's first Test match in 1956. South Africa's Hugh Tayfield's innings bowling figures of 9/113 in 1957 against England are the best innings bowling figures in a Test match on the ground. Tayfield was the first South African to take nine wickets in an innings. The only five-wicket haul in a women's Test match was taken by South African Lorna Ward in 1972.\nThe first five-wicket haul in an ODI on the ground was take by South Africa's Shaun Pollock in 2000. Pollock's figures of 5/20 against England remain the best ODI bowling figures in the ground. The first five-wicket hauls in T20I matches on the ground were both taken on 18 February 2018. South Africa's Shabnim Ismail took 5/30 in a women's T20I ahead of India's Bhuvneshwar Kumar repeating the feat in a men's match later on the same day.\nTest Match five-wicket hauls.\nA total of 55 five-wicket hauls have been taken on the ground in Test matches, all but one of them in men's matches.\nOne Day International five-wicket hauls.\nFive five-wicket hauls have been taken in ODIs on the ground, four in men's cricket and one in women's cricket.\nTwenty20 International five-wicket hauls.\nFour five-wicket hauls have been taken in T20I matches on the ground, two in men's cricket and two in women's cricket."

        "text": "Newlands Cricket Ground in Cape Town, South Africa was established in 1888 and has hosted international cricket since 1889. The ground's first Test match was played between a South African representative XI and an English side touring South Africa. This match was given retrospective Test match status in 1897. The first One Day International (ODI) played on the ground took place in 1992 following the reintegration of South Africa to international cricket after the sporting boycott of South Africa during the apartheid era. The first Twenty20 International (T20I) on the ground was played in 2007. Two women's Test matches were played on the ground, one in 1962 and one in 1970, and women's ODI and T20I matches have been played at Newlands since 2009.\nIn cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five-for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement. This article details the five-wicket hauls taken on the ground in official international Test matches, One Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals.\nThree five-wicket hauls were taken in the ground's first Test match in 1889, South African Gobo Ashley taking seven wickets for the cost of 95 runs (7/95) in the first innings of the match. England bowler Johnny Briggs took 7/17 and 8/11 in the South African side's two innings as the hosts were bowled out for 47 and 43 runs when they batted. Briggs' bowling figures are the best on the ground in Test matches, with match figures of 15/28. In women's Test cricket, both five-wicket hauls on the ground were taken by Lorna Ward, the first in the 1960 match.\nSouth Africa's Hansie Cronje took the first five-wicket haul on the ground in a One Day International, taking 5/32 against India in 1992. This was the first One Day International played in South Africa. Zimbabwe's Henry Olonga recorded the best ODI bowling figures with 6/19 against England in 2000. The only five-wicket haul taken in a Twenty20 International on the ground was taken by West Indian Anisa Mohammed in a women's T20I in 2009.\nTest match five-wicket hauls.\nA total of 75 five-wicket hauls have been taken in Test matches on the ground, including two in women's Tests.\nOne Day International five-wicket hauls.\nA total of eight five-wicket hauls have been taken in ODIs on the ground, all in men's matches.\nTwenty20 International five-wicket hauls.\nA single five-wicket haul has been taken in T20 International matches at Newlands. West Indies bowler Anisa Mohammed took five wickets against South Africa in a women's T20I in 2009."

        "text": "The UAAP Season 82 basketball tournaments were the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) basketball tournaments for the 2019–20 school year.\nJensen Ilagan, the technical director of the regional ASEAN Basketball League was appointed commissioner for the season's basketball tournaments on August 6, 2019.\nThe senior men's and women's tournaments began on September 4, 2019, while the juniors' division which was sub-hosted by National University held their opening games on November 13 for the boys' tournament and on January 11, 2020 for the newly formed girls' competition.\nThe men's defending champions Ateneo Blue Eagles won all 14 elimination round games to become the only second men's basketball team to advance to the UAAP Finals outright (after UE in 2007). The remaining Final Four teams figured in the stepladder format to determine Ateneo's finals opponent. UST defeated FEU in the first round to meet UP in the second round, who are holding their first twice-to-beat advantage in the Final Four era. The Growling Tigers defeated the Fighting Maroons twice to deny UP's finals rematch against Ateneo and become the lowest-seeded basketball team in UAAP history to have competed in the championship round.\nIn the first #1 vs #4 UAAP Finals match-up in any of the league's events, the Blue Eagles swept the finals for a second consecutive year, being crowned undefeated champions (and the first men's basketball team in UAAP history to pose a 16–0 season win sweep record). Graduating player Thirdy Ravena became the first athlete in UAAP history to win three consecutive Finals MVP awards.\nThe women's defending champions NU Lady Bulldogs also won all elimination round games. In the stepladder, FEU outlasted Adamson in the first round, to meet #2 seeded UST in the next round. UST needed its twice-to-beat advantage to eliminate the Lady Tamaraws from contention. The Tigresses fell short against the NU Lady Bulldogs, who were without their best player Jack Animam, who was injured. The Lady Bulldogs won their sixth consecutive title, all undefeated seasons.\nThe juniors' division introduced a girls' tournament, a demonstration sport. The boys' defending champions, the NSNU Bullpups, finished the elimination round undefeated. Last year's finalist, the Ateneo Blue Eaglets, were defeated by the Adamson Baby Falcons in the first round of the stepladder. FEU arranged a Finals match-up with the Bullpups after beating the Baby Falcons in the second round. The Bullpups finished the season undefeated though, winning both Finals games.\nThe inaugural girls' tournament featured four teams, with the top 2 teams qualifying for the Finals. The Adamson Lady Baby Falcons finished the elimination round undefeated, while the UST Junior Tigresses fended off the DLSZ Lady Junior Archers in their last elimination round game to qualify for the Finals. The two teams split the first two Finals games, with the second game held behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The UAAP then canceled the tournament, declaring both teams co-champions.\nTeams.\nAll eight member universities of the UAAP fielded teams in all two divisions. Only four high schools fielded in teams for the inaugural girls' basketball tournament.\nCoaches.\nThe UE Red Warriors' Lawrence Chongson and the De La Salle Green Archers' Jermaine Byrd were both recognized by the UAAP as active consultants of their respective teams. Gian Nazario who had been listed by La Salle as their coach clarified that the school is yet to make an announcement regarding Byrd's official appointment. Bong Tan, who had replaced Joe Silva as coach explained the unique setup in their team. With Chongson as consultant, he is able to trust him and take a backseat during games.\nTan died on November 11, 2019. It was reported that he had collapsed while playing in a basketball game in Mandaluyong.\nVenues.\nThe Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay and the Smart Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City are the primary venues for the men's tournament, and the venues for the Finals series for the women's tournament. The Ynares Center in Antipolo is an alternative venue for the men's tournament.

FEU sustains the current longest playoffs streak, appearing in all playoffs since 2013. For UST, this is their first playoffs appearance since their 2015 runner-up finish.\nUST led by 26 at halftime. Ken Tuffin led an FEU scoring run in the third quarter that cut the lead to 10. Rhenz Abando and Renzo Subido scored back-to-back three-pointers to end the third quarter with UST up by 14. FEU then again had 9–0 run to cut the lead to five, but Subido and Soulemane Chabi Yo scored eight points together to put the Tigers up for good. Tuffin and Xyrus Torres cut the lead 78–71 but that was the closest the Tamaraws can get.\n(2) UP vs. (4) UST.\nThe UP Fighting Maroons have a twice-to-beat advantage. This is UP's second consecutive playoffs appearance, and the first time they have the twice-to-beat advantage.\nUST, which has never lost to UP this season, led 19–13 in the first quarter, with Renzo Subido and Rhenz Abando converting multiple three-pointers. Abando and CJ Cansino scored for the Tigers in the second quarter, to extend the lead to 18. Trailing at halftime 41–24, Juan Gomez de Liaño scored seven consecutive points to cut the lead to 12, but he injured his ankle, and the Tigers had another run to lead 52–33. Bright Akhuetie and the return of Gomez de Liaño cut the deficit to 11, but UST closed out the quarter scoring on each of its possessions to lead 60–47. UP cut the lead again to 11, but Sherwin Concepcion and Mark Nonoy made back-to-back three pointers to put UST up for good, extending the series to a deciding Game 2.\nUST started the deciding Game 2 the same way Game 1 started, making a double-digit lead, and limiting UP to just 6 points after the first quarter. The Fighting Maroons outscored the Tigers in the second quarter though to cut the lead to one point at halftime. In the fourth quarter, UP led for the first time in the series, off a Gomez de Liaño jump-shot, and extended the lead further off a Jun Manzo lay-up. Akhuetie then suffered from cramps, that led to Manzo fouling a UST player to stop the clock; it was his fifth and he was disqualified from the game. UP led by four just after the two-minute warning off a Kobe Paras slam dunk, but Abando scored on a fast-break to cut the lead to a single possession. Ricci Rivero missed on a lay-up for UP, Renzo Subido made a three-pointer to give UST the lead for good, and the Tigers advance to the Finals.\nFinals.\nThis is a best-of-three playoff. This is Ateneo's fourth consecutive Finals appearance, and their first after winning all elimination round games. This is UST's first Finals appearance since their 2015 runner-up finish vs. FEU.\nAteneo started Game 1 on an 18–2 run and never looked back to take a wire-to-wire victory. A UST scoring run led by Mark Nonoy cut the lead to two in the second quarter, but that's the closest the Tigers could get as Ateneo had its own 13–1 to end the first half. Ateneo increased its lead to 23 in the third quarter, and Nonoy's back-to-back three-pointers in the fourth period were canceled out by Angelo Kouame and Matt Nieto's baskets. Thirdy Ravena scored a season-high 32 points, Kouame had 18 points and 12 rebounds, and SJ Belangel scored 12 for Ateneo, who shot 52.05% from the field as a team.\nAwards.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's awards\" /&gt; \nBroadcast notes.\nABS-CBN Sports is the last broadcaster of the UAAP Season 82 Men's Basketball games to aired on S+A and Liga the network was a 20 years of UAAP games.

        "text": "The Tennis Bundesliga or 1. Bundesliga is the top level of the German tennis league system. It was formed in 1972. Contested by 10 clubs it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the 2. Bundesliga (formed in 2001). Seasons are usually played in the months of July and August.\nEach team plays nine matches, one against each other team. A match between team consists of four singles matches followed by two doubles matches.\nThe company Tennis Point sponsors the league and has acquired the naming rights in 2009, which resulted in the official title of the competition being \"Tennis-Point-Bundesliga\".\nThe 2019 season was the 48th season of the competition. 53 clubs have been part of the league since its inception. The most successful club is TC Blau-Weiss Neuss, winner of 10 championships. The reigning champions are TK Grün-Weiss Mannheim.\nThe 2020 season was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nCompetition format.\nEvery club plays each other club once. In any given matchup four singles matches are played (usually a pair of matches followed by another pair) and then two doubles follow. All matches are best of three sets with the third set being a tiebreak to ten points, dubbed the \"Champions Tiebreak\". In case both teams win three of their matches their matchup is considered a draw, however, sets and games are used as tiebreakers in the overall league standings. At the end of the season the team with the most points is crowned German champions.\nClubs.\nTen following clubs were scheduled to compete in the 2020 season of the Bundesliga. However, as the season was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic the same lineup of teams will just be used for the 2021 season. Sponsors' names are often part of the Bundesliga teams names. Thus for example the Rochusclub fields a Bundesliga team which itself is referred to as \"Allpresan Rochusclub Düsseldorf\"."

        "text": "George Main (9 July 1879 – 31 August 1948) was an Australian pastoralist and horse breeder, chairman of the Australian Jockey Club (AJC)(later Australian Turf Club) from 1937 to 1945.\nHistory.\nMain was born in Ardrossan, Scotland, the eldest son of Hugh Main (c. 1831 – 9 August 1885) of Saltcoats, Ayrshire, and educated at Troubridge School, where he was a member of the cadet corps, and shot at Bisley.\nHe and his brother Hugh were brought out to South Australia by their father in 1884, and had a home \"Lisnamorra\", Medindie.\nBoth were educated at Roseworthy Agricultural College.\nIn 1900 George enlisted in the Bushmen's Contingent, a South Australian volunteer force mobilised to fight in the Boer War. He enlisted with the 7th Contingent in January 1902, at which time he was resident at Victor Harbor.\nTheir father had two blocks on Kermode Street, North Adelaide, in partnership with Nathaniel Alexander Knox (died 1908) with five two-storey houses, all tenanted. He also owned a city block on the corner of Hurtle Square and Hanson Street with two shops and six houses. These properties were advertised for sale by auction in August 1908, around the time the brothers made the move to Illabo, New South Wales.\nThe two men established the pastoral property \"Retreat\" at East Illabo or Bethungra, New South Wales, south west of Cootamundra, around 1906. Hugh enlisted with the 1st AIF and served in France during WWI, while George managed the property. Pte. Hugh Main returned in 1919; his part of the property was often called \"Retreat East\".\nGeorge Main was a successful horse breeder and studmaster. Notable stallions were Featherstitch (1905–1923) by Ayrshire, and Limelight. Featherstitch, whom he purchased in 1909, was imported 1907 by James N. Hart (died 1920), and won the 1909 Tattersall's Stakes at Randwick, and was the sire of many good horses.\nMain raced several of his own horses, but unsuccessfully.\nHe married Mary \"Polly\" Weston of Kadlinga Station at Mintaro, South Australia on 3 March 1908, and settled down at \"Retreat\". Their children included Jean Main, who married Clive Caldwell on 13 April 1940. Caldwell would later rise to fame (and a little infamy) as an \"ace\" RAAF fighter pilot.\nMain was elected a member of the AJC in 1911 and elected to the committee in September 1921. He acted as temporary Chairman during the final illness of Sir Colin Stephen, and was elected to the position on 16 September 1937, resigning in November 1945, to be succeeded by A. G. Potter.\nHe died at \"Retreat\" on 31 August 1948 and his remains were buried at the Cootamundra Cemetery. He was survived by his wife Mary, sons George and Hugh, and daughters Molly and Agnes \"Toots\" Main, and Jean Caldwell. His estate was valued at £32,036 for probate purposes."

        "text": "The Germany women's national football team has represented Germany at the FIFA Women's World Cup on nine occasions in 1991, 1995, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2011, 2015, 2019 and 2023. They have won the title twice and were runners-up once. They also reached the fourth place in 1991 and in 2015.\n1991 World Cup.\nThe German national team had qualified as the European Champions for the first World Cup. With 18 players, national coach Gero Bisanz drove to the \"Middle Kingdom\". In the preliminary round, the German team celebrated three wins and remained without conceding. Nigeria was defeated 4-0, Taiwan 2-0 and Italy national football team 2-0. In the quarter-finals was the opponent Denmark. The game was the first of the World Cup history, which went into extra time. The Bisanz-Elf finally prevailed 2-1. Opponent in the semifinals was the selection of the United States, which was a number too big for the German team. At the end of the match, it was a 0-4 defeat in the third-place match against Sweden. Heidi Mohr proved with her seven tournament goals that she was one of the world's top scorer in her time.\n1995 World cup.\nOnce again, the German team qualified as European champion for the second World Cup. For the first time the World Cup took place on European soil. The German team failed in the final Norway.\nThe German team started with a painstaking 1-0 victory (goal: Silvia Neid) over Japan in the tournament. In the second group game, the hosts waited and it looked as if the German team could reciprocate for the defeat in the small final of 1991. Bettina Wiegmann and Ursula Lohn ensured the 2-0 half-time lead. After Andersson's strike, the Swedes could still play the game in the last five minutes. Due to the defeat, the last group match against Brazil had to be won. With a brilliant 6: 1 victory, the Elf of Gero Bisanz secured the group victory. Birgit Prinz scored her first World Cup goal.\nIn the quarter-finals, Germany met England. Maren Meinert, Heidi Mohr and Martina Voss ensured a solid 3-0 victory. The semi-final was more difficult against China. The Chinese made in the defense deft the rooms and allowed only a few chances for the German team. After many futile attempts Bettina Wiegmann scored in the 79th minute the redeeming 1: 0. Thus, the German team reached the final against Norway for the first time. A Norwegian strike just before half-time through Riise and Pettersen sealed the final defeat.\n1999 World Cup.\nFor the third World Cup UEFA started Qualifying for the first time). To date, UEFA is the only continental federation to hold separate World Cup qualifiers. The DFB-Elf, who have been coached by Tina Theune-Meyer since 1996, had to relegate after a surprising defeat against Netherlands and another defeat by Norway. In the relegation, the Germans made it all by the 5-0 first-leg victory against the Ukraine everything.\nThe German team was difficult in the preliminary round. At the beginning there was a happy draw against Italy. In the second game, World Cup debutant Mexico was knocked down 6: 0. Inka Grings was the first German player to score three goals in a World Cup match. In the last group match, the team did not come out over a 3: 3 against Brazil and was only second in the group. In the quarterfinals, they met the host and failed on their own nerves. Despite two leads (Brandi Chastain by own goal, Bettina Wiegmann), Theune-Meyer-Elf lost 2: 3.\n2003 World Cup.\nAt the 2003 World Cup, the German national team became champions for the first time. This made Germany the first nation to win a world title in both men's and women's football. The World Cup should have taken place again at the People's Republic of China, but due to the SARS epidemic, the tournament was temporarily relocated to the United States. The German team kept a white vest during qualifying. All six games were won and only the Englishwoman Rachel Yankey could score a goal against the German team.\nIn the first round match the German team met Canada. The Canadians took the lead after a few minutes. Thereafter, the German team turned up and came to a 4-1 victory. It was followed by a 3-0 victory over Japan and at the conclusion of the preliminary round, a 6-1 victory against Argentina. In this game, Steffi Jones suffered an Anterior cruciate ligament injury and had to travel home.\nAs a group winner the Germans reached the quarterfinals. The Russians was sent home with a 7-1 score. Kerstin Garefrekes and Birgit Prinz scored two goals each. In the semifinals the opponent was called USA again. In a women's football game of all time, which was the best for many experts, the German team was able to successfully take revenge and moved into the final with a 3-0 victory. In the final, the German team met Sweden. This resulted in a new edition of the Euro 2001. Just before the half-time whistle, Hanna Ljungberg took the Trekroners into the lead. Not even a minute was played in the second half when Maren Meinert equalized. After regular time it was 1: 1, so that an extension was necessary. In the 98th minute, the German team received a free kick. Renate Lingor brought the leather into the box. Nia Künzer headed the ball over Swedish keeper Caroline Jönsson. With this Golden Goal Germany was world champion.\n2007 World Cup.\nIn qualifying, the German team could win all the games and qualify so confidently for the World Cup in China. For the first time the team received a bonus for the successful qualification. A total of 200,000 euros were distributed by the DFB. The World Cup, in which the German team met in the preliminary round on Argentina, England and Japan, was then for the German team to the tournament of superlatives, because they set the following records:\nAfter winning the record for the opening match against Argentina, the team had to content themselves with a goalless draw against England, but by a 2-0 win over Japan, the team could qualify for the quarter-final against North Korea which she won 3-0. The semi-final against Norway was won 3-0. In the final against Brazil then faced two equal teams, with the Brazilians with Marta and Cristiane had the better single players, but the German team was occupied more homogeneous and so ultimately the final could win 2-0.\n2011 World Cup.\nAt the home World Cup Germany wanted to be the first country to win the title for the third time in a row. The Bundesliga season was ended in mid-March, the cup final held in late March. The initially 26-member squad met for seven courses between which four friendly matches against teams with similar playing styles as the group opponents took place. In the process, Silvia Neid changed her starting line-up again and again, especially during the attack, and also up to six players during the matches. All friendly matches were won without conceding and scored 15 goals. Five of them scored U-20 World Cup top scorer Alexandra Popp. Nevertheless, she came in the World Cup matches only as a substitute used and remained without scoring.\nIn the opening match Germany started with a 2-1 victory over Canada. This was followed by a hard-fought 1-0 against African champions Nigeria. After these two victories, the quarter-finals were fixed. In both games, record national player and captain Birgit Prinz was replaced. In the final group match against France and also in the quarter-final, she did not come to use. If the German team in the match against France could significantly increase and defeat the previously also twice victorious French with 4-2, so had to accept the first defeat against Japan after 15 World Cup games without defeat and for the second time after 1999 after the quarter-finals to pack the bags. It was the fourth defeat in a World Cup - knockout-round against the eventual champion.\nAfter the departure, Bernd Schröder in particular criticized the too long preparation time as well as the tactics. For Schröder, the long preparation time also had the disadvantage that the national team of 1. FFC Turbine Potsdam were not available to prepare for Champions League Final, which lost to Potsdam 2-0 at the end of May against Olympique Lyon ,\nBirgit Prinz and Ariane Hingst, both of whom had played for Germany for more than 14 years, announced their retirement from the national team immediately after their defeat by Japan, but the DFB announced a farewell match that would not have been possible for Birgit Prinz on 27 March 2012 took place. Silvia Neid initially did not want to comment on her future in a few weeks. But on 13 July, the national coach announced that she wanted to fulfill her contract, which had been extended until the 2016 World Cup, and would like to build a new team for the European Championship 2013. With this, the European title could be defended.\nWith the defeat and the simultaneous semi-final entry of France and Sweden also for the first time the qualification for the Olympic women's tournament missed.\nOn 23 and 29 August 2011, Ursula Holl and Kerstin Garefrekes also announced their departure from the national team.\nAfter the quarter-final against Japan, the team remained unbeaten in 22 games successively and lost only in the final of 2013 Algarve Cup against the United States.\n2015 World Cup.\nIn the Qualification, which started in the autumn of 2013 after the European Championships in Sweden, the team met Russia, Ireland, the Slovakia, Slovenia and Croatia. Except for Slovenia, the German team had previously played against all other group opponents and also lost no game against them, with only Russia could score goals against the German team. Most recently, Germany, the most frequent opponent of the Russian team, met Russia in a friendly for the 2009 European Championship in August 2009 and won 3-1 in Bochum. Two matches against Slovakia were played in the qualifiers for the 1997 European Championships in 1995 and 1996, Croatia were opponents in qualifying for the 1995 European Championship and against Ireland, the team played twice in qualifying for the 2007 World Cup. Apart from Russia, none of the group opponents could qualify for a World Cup or European Championship finals.\nThe German team met Russia in the first match on 21 September 2013 and inflicted the highest defeat on Russia at 9: 0, which was decisive that Russia missed the playoff games of the best runners-up in the end. Then came on 26 October for the first time encounter with Slovenia, the German team with the 13: 0 in Slovenia, the highest victory in a World Cup qualifying and the highest away win succeeded. The following games were won without conceding, so that the German team went with five wins and 40: 0 goals in the winter break. The qualification was continued on April 5, 2014 with the game in Ireland, with the German team had to accept the first goals in a 3-2 victory. For the German team ended the qualification on September 17, 2014 with a 2-0 win in the home game against Ireland. Germany won all 10 games and qualified prematurely on September 13 for the World Cup.\nAs the World Cup in Canada is to be played on artificial turf, against which several players have spoken out, the German team played on October 29, 2014 in the Behrn Arena in Örebro against Sweden a test match on artificial turf, which was won 2-1. Previously a friendly match against France was lost 2-0 at Offenbach am Main and then at London on 23 November Wembley Stadium against England 3-0 win.\nIn the group draw in Ottawa, Canada, on December 6, 2014, Germany, previously group head of Group B, was scored as an opponent: Ivory Coast, Norway and Thailand.\nGermany put in the first game against Ivory Coast with a 10: 0, the second highest World Cup victory a sign. They dominated the first half of the final against Norway, but only scored one goal and had to equalize in the second half. Also against physically inferior Thai women they were the game-determining team, but could only score four goals. Nevertheless, they were group winners with the better goal difference, as Norway had won with the same result against Thailand, against the Ivory Coast, only a 3-1 reached. Sweden were defeated 4-1 in the round of 16, with the Swedish goalkeeper still their best player. In the quarter-final against strong French women, the DFB-Elf could prevail only in the penalty shoot-out, against the US was then in the semi-final, the marksmanship away from the penalty spot, so that the game was lost 0: 2. In the small final was then lost for the first time against England, which had never been beyond the quarter-finals.\n2019 World Cup.\nIn the Qualification, which began in the autumn of 2017 after the European Championships in the Netherlands, the team met Iceland, Czech Republic, for the first time the Faroe Islands and Slovenia. The German team, who were eliminated for the first time at the European Championships in the quarter-finals and then Anja Mittag had announced her resignation, met in the first game on Slovenia and won 6-0. Simone Laudehr, who could not play a year due to injury, made her 100th international appearance. Three days later, in the Czech Republic, it was only a painful 1-0 victory, favored by an own goal from a Czech player. In the third game, the team lost 2: 3 and thus for the first time after 14 victorious games against Iceland and for the first time a home game in the World Cup qualifiers. The team fell back in the table in third place, but the top spot four days later by a 11-0 draw against the Faroe Islands, in which Hasret Kayikçi scored the last four goals, with simultaneous division of points between Iceland and the Czech Republic to recapture. One week after the team was without a win at the 2018 SheBelieves Cup and came in last, Germany coach Steffi Jones was dismissed.\nHorst Hrubesch took over the office of women's federal coach, but his mission was extended after Martina Voss-Tecklenburg, currently coach of Switzerland, agreed that she would leave office after completing the World Cup qualification takes over. Under Hrubesch the remaining four qualifiers were won without conceding, including 2: 0 the return leg in Iceland. They had won against Iceland direct comparison due to the more goals scored and since the Icelandic women could not win the second game against the Czech Republic, Germany was group winner and Iceland also missed the playoff games of the best runners-up for the last European World Cup starting place.\nAt the World Cup finals, China and Spain as well as South Africa were the opponents of the group stage. With three wins without conceding the round of 16 was achieved. Here Africa champion Nigeria was beaten 3-0. In the quarterfinals after 24 years again a competitive match against Sweden was lost. Although Lina Magull gave the German team the lead in the 16th minute, it only lasted six minutes. Shortly after the half-time break, the Swedes could use a defensive weakness of the German team and achieve the winning goal."

However, Ghana were followed by a 7–2, with Ragnhild Gulbrandsen alone scoring three goals. Norway were group winners and met host China in the quarter-finals. With 1: 0, the Norwegians could retaliate for the semi-final defeat eight years earlier and move into the semifinals. Here they met defending champion Germany and lost 0–3. Germany was then able to win the final against Brazil and be the first team to defend the world title and remain without conceding in the tournament. Norway, however, lost the third/fourth place play-off against the United States with 1: 4 and thus for the first time in a World Cup three games.

Against Brazil followed then a 0–3 defeat. The final game against Australia was then for second place. Although Norway went 1–0 in the 56th minute, but had to accept the postponed compensation. As the Australians had the better goal difference, this draw was enough for them to move into the quarter-finals, so Norway pushed for the winner, but had to accept the 1: 2 in the 87th minute and could not compensate this. Thus Norway dropped out for the first time in the preliminary round and thus could not qualify for the women's football tournament at the Olympic Games 2012 in which only the two best European teams in the World Cup and Britain could participate as hosts. Group winners Brazil and Australia failed but both in the quarterfinals.\n2015 World Cup.\nIn the Qualification the Norwegians prevail again. In the group were the Netherlands, who qualified for the World Cup for the first time through the playoffs, Belgium, Portugal, Greece and for the first time Albania the opponents. After nine victories Norway was qualified on 13 September 2014 as the third European team for the World Cup finals. The last game against the Netherlands was then lost, but could be countered, as the Netherlands had come in the home game against Belgium only to a 1: 1.\nIn the draw of the groups, the Norwegians were not set and were the group B with Germany against which they had lost the last European Championship final ,Other group opponents included the World Cup newcomers Thailand and the Ivory Coast.\nIn the group they prevailed sovereign and was only because of the worse goal difference behind Germany second. In the second round Norway lost 1: 2 against England. Norway missed out on qualifying for the Women's Football Tournament at the 2016 Olympic Games, but still had the chance to win the third European Olympic ticket in play-offs against the three other European knockout fans , National coach Pellerud resigned from his post in August, believing the chances of qualifying for the Olympics were higher without him. These were missed in March 2016, when it was enough for only one win and two defeats and thus only the disappointing 4th place.\n2019 World Cup.\nIn the Qualification for the world cup, the team had to face European champions Netherlands, Ireland, Slovakia and Northern Ireland. After victories against Northern Ireland and Slovakia, the Norwegians lost 0–1 in the Netherlands. After that, they won all matches, including on the final day of the home game against the Netherlands 2–1. Although this was the direct comparison by the more away away goals for the Dutch women, but since they had come in November at home to Ireland only a goalless draw, they had – although they won all other games – in the end two points less than the Norwegians , which thus achieved the direct qualification.\nGroup opponents in France were the hosts as well as Nigeria and South Korea. The Norwegians started 3–0 against Nigeria, losing 2–1 to France and securing second place with a 2–1 win against South Korea. In the last sixteen they met Australia. As it was 1: 1 after 120 minutes, it came to the penalty shoot-out, the Norwegians won 4: 1. In the quarter-final against England they came in the third minute in arrears and conceded shortly before the break, the second goal. In the second half, they could not take advantage of several opportunities, but instead collected the third goal. The departure did not qualify them for the 2020 Olympics."

Western Suburbs would go on to win their first premiership as they won the match 27–2.\nIn 1932, Spillane played in 8 matches for Wests but did not play in the finals series or the grand final which Western Suburbs lost to South Sydney by a score of 19–12.

He then joined another Cork club, Sundays Well, where his performances saw him join the Munster squad ahead of the 1998–99 season, going on to play in the 2000 Heineken Cup Final defeat against English side Northampton Saints and again in the inaugural final of the [Celtic league final]in 2001 defeat against Leinster. In 2002 he went on to play against Leicester in the Heineken cup final in the millennium stadium where Munster were defeated again .\nHe is perhaps best known for scoring the infamous \"try that wasn't\" in Munster's 16–15 Heineken Cup semi-final defeat against Stade Français in 2001. O'Neill scored a try in the corner to win the game but it was disallowed by the referee, who had judged that the ball had gone into touch before O'Neill grounded it. Despite television replays proving that O'Neill had in fact scored a legitimate try, the video evidence could not be used, as it was only available in the Six Nations at the time. The try would have given Munster the win, but instead Stade hung on for the victory.\nO'Neill was called up to the Ireland squad that toured new Zealand in 2002 but he never won any international caps. He retired from rugby due to an ankle injury in July 2004 and has since gone on to become a community rugby officer for the province."

On the Legends Tour, the minimum age is 45, although with the USGA instituting the new U.S. Senior Women's Open in 2018, it chose a minimum age of 50. Also, the U.S. Senior Women's Open is played over four rounds, whereas the Senior LPGA Championship is played over three rounds. A golfer's performances can be quite variable from one round to the next, so playing an extra round increases the likelihood that the tournament will be won by leading players.\nIn order of foundation, the senior women's majors are:\nSenior women's major winners.\nIn 2018, the first year with two majors for senior women, Laura Davies won both, and the following year Helen Alfredsson replicated the feat."

Khan was 20 years and 350 days old when he led the side in the one-off Test, becoming the youngest cricketer to captain a team in a Test match. On the first day of the match, Rahmat Shah became the first batsman to score a century for Afghanistan in a Test. During the one-off Test match, Afghanistan's Mohammad Nabi announced his retirement from Test cricket, to allow him to focus on white-ball cricket.\nAfghanistan won the one-off Test match by 224 runs. It was Afghanistan's second win in Test cricket, their first overseas, and Rashid Khan became the youngest captain to win a Test match. Bangladesh started the fifth and final day of the match on 136/6, with Afghanistan needing just four wickets to win. Play did not start until after 4pm local time, with Afghanistan taking the wickets they needed to win the Test match in the 18.3 overs that were scheduled to be bowled.

With ECAC 2 already holding a tournament for the vast majority of eastern schools, the NAIA received most of their bids from western schools with a few exceptions (Boston State and Salem State). The NAIA tournament would be the only national championship for non-Division I programs until the NCAA started holding the Division II Championship in 1978, after which the NAIA division declined until it was dropped as a sponsored sport in 1984."

        "title": "1922 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1922 Auckland Rugby League was the 14th in its history. There were 68 teams playing across the various grades. City Rovers won the first grade championship for the 5th time, with Ponsonby winning the Roope Rooster for the 2nd time. City Rovers also defended the Challenge Shield, warding off efforts from Petone, Tongariro, and Huntly to lift it from them. Bill Davidson set a record for points scored in an Auckland club rugby league season with 116 for City Rovers. He and his brothers Ben and George between them scored 186 of City Rover's 339 points which was also a competition record for a team in a single season. City scored a further 19 points in the Roope Rooster competition and 85 points in their 3 Challenge Shield matches for 443 points in all official games.\nIt was an incredibly busy year for the Auckland representative team. They played more matches than some club teams had played in earlier seasons with ten matches in total. There was also an Auckland Provincial team match against New South Wales, and one Auckland B fixture with the team making the trip down to Cambridge to play the local side. Bill Davidson also led the representative team in scoring with 37 points.\n \n \nAuckland rugby league news.\nJunior Management Committee.\nThe junior management committee elected for the season was Lewis Binns, J.S. White, K. Lippiatt, G.J. Flynn, W. Baskett, William Mincham, O.O. Riley, D.C. Adamson, W.E. Frost, Bill Davidson (Hon. Sec), A. Freeman (Chairman), G.H. Seagar, A.H. Te Mete, T.B. Carpenter, W. Dowle, G.F. Burgess, J. Curtis, F. Cleal, W. Boag, F. Kennedy.\nCarlaw Park.\nAt a pre-season meeting of the management committee it was discussed that Carlaw Park needed more 'modern equipment', and it was decided that \"the establishment of more modern methods of dealing with the turf and the purchase of more efficient machinery shall be an early charge on the new season's funds\". Sufficient money was made from gates at club and rep fixtures at Carlaw Park and the Auckland Domain to begin improvements on the ground at the conclusion of the season.\nNew clubs and name changes.\nMaritime to Athletic.\nThe Maritime club changed their name to 'Athletic'. Their club colours were also changed from red, white and blue to royal blue with a gold band. In 1926 they were to change their name again to Grafton Athletic. This was not to be confused with Grafton Athletic who had existed as a team from 1914 to 1920 under the leadership of Karl Ifwersen and were presently playing under the name of 'Fire Brigade'.\nRichmond promoted to 1st grade.\nRichmond Rovers applied for entry into the Senior A Grade competition and this was approved. This made the competition an even 8 teams meaning 4 matches per round and no byes. Unlike most previous seasons there were no byes, no defaults, and no postponed matches meaning 56 matches were played in total, easily the most in the competitions history. Richmond would go on to finish 7th with 3 wins and 11 losses.\nIhumātao club enter.\nOn April 4 the ARL management committee reported that they had accepted the application of a new club called the \"Central Mangere Club\", and they would enter a team in the second grade. The team was however exclusively named \"Ihumata\" for their existence and were ostensibly a Māori football side. It was a misspelling of their area's Māori name and was corrected at a later date to Ihumātao. They were based in the Ihumātao area of Māngere and played most of their home games at the Mangere ground further towards the east. They only survived for two seasons with it likely that many of their players began playing for the preexisting Māngere United League Football Club such as Paul and Wilson junior.\nCoromandel Old Boys join.\nOn February 15 the Auckland Rugby League held their weekly management committee meeting and said that \"affiliation was granted to a new third grade club to be called Coromandel Old Boys, with the colours red, white, and blue\". a Thames Old Boys team had existed from 1915 to 1920 but this team appears to have had no serious links to the Coromandel Old Boys side. The Coromandel team fielded a third grade side only from 1922 to 1925 before withdrawing from the competition.\nGeorge Davidson's return.\nGeorge Davidson played for Maritime (now named Athletic) in the 1919 season but had missed most of the 1920 and 1921 seasons as he was training for and competing at the Antwerp Olympics where he came 5th in the 200m final. He stated that over those two seasons he had only played for Maritime on two or three occasions as he was seeking a transfer to the City Rovers where his two brothers Bill and Ben played. Athletic were denying his request and Davidson appealed to the league who then asked the Athletics club to reconsider his request \"favourably\". He would eventually have his transfer to City approved.\nPoint Chevalier.\nPoint Chevalier secured the use of Richard and Elizabeth Walker's paddock at the bottom of Humariri Street as their home ground. It has since become Walker Park where they are to this day located. In the same season they bought jerseys from George Court &amp; Co. Ltd. In 1925 a shed was built at Walker Park with volunteer labour.\nMonteith Shield (1st grade championship).\nMonteith Shield fixtures.\nRound 1.\nPeter Irwin James Francis Hing, better known as James Hing, or later Sonny Hing scored a try for Ponsonby. He had previously played for Marist and would later coach the Point Chevalier premier side in the 1930s. He was the son of Charles A'Hing and Margaret Mary Irwin and was one of the first ever rugby league players in New Zealand with Chinese ancestry along with Arthur Singe.\nRound 2.\n Lou Brown debuted for Newton aged just 17 having already played 2 seasons of senior rugby in the Waikato. He would go on to have a remarkable career being a prolific try scorer for every team he played for which included Newton (12), Wigan (106), City (72), Halifax (33), York (77), Bordeaux, Auckland (18), North Island (4), Auckland Māori (4), Other Nationalities (5), and New Zealand (22). In the match between Athletic and Ponsonby Eric Grey had a highly unusual collection of points after he scored a try, and kicked a conversion, a penalty, a goal from a mark, and a drop goal. Bert Laing transferred to Devonport during the week and had the unusual distinction of scoring against a team and then for a team in the space of a week.\nRound 3.\nStan Webb debuted for North Shore joining his older brother Clarence in the side. Stan would go on to represent Auckland in the same season and New Zealand in 1925. He predominantly played in the halfback position but also played at centre and fullback at times.\nRound 7.\nThe match between Devonport and Marist was the 50th senior rugby league game played at Devonport Domain. The first match played there was in 1910.\nRoope Rooster knockout competition.\nThe loss by Athletic in the final was remarkably their 5th consecutive loss in the Roope Rooster final (their previous 4 under the name or Maritime).\nTop try scorers and point scorers.\nThese lists include tries and points scored in the First Grade competition and the Roope Rooster competition only. Bill Davidson set a record for the number of points scored by a single player in a season. While earlier seasons were often incomplete with some points unattributed his 116 points was well ahead of the previous highest of 78 by Karl Ifwersen in the 1915 season. P Gallagher of Marist was the top try scorer with 15.\nChallenge shield matches.\nCity Rovers came into the season as holders of the trophy after defeating Ponsonby United the previous season. The shield had taken the place of the Thacker Shield which had been taken from Ponsonby and returned to the Canterbury Rugby League after a dispute over who was eligible to compete for it. City went on to defend the shield 3 times during the season defeating Petone, Tongariro, and Huntly.\nCity v Tongariro.\nThe Tongariro team was \"made up of Maori players drawn from the scattered settlements of the King Country\" according to the New Zealand Herald match report, though were missing some of their best players. The Auckland Star reported that many of their players were graduates of Te Aute College.\nCity v Huntly.\nHuntly came to Auckland as the South Auckland (Waikato) champions and were expected to provide a stern test to City however after a competitive first half they fell away badly in the second half with City ending up running in 11 tries.\nLower grades.\nThere were 7 lower grades in 1922 if you include the Sixth Grade which was split into an A and B grade and the Cadet Competition. Mr. G. Davis donated a trophy for the junior club with the most points and it was won by Richmond, with City second and Ponsonby third.\nSecond grade.\nCity Rovers defeated Devonport United 16–13 in the final on September 2. Marist and Ellerslie had withdrawn after 2 rounds and had no results reported so possibly didn't play in any matches and therefore have been omitted from the standings, Newton withdrew after 8, Athletic after 9, and Otahuhu after 10. A knockout competition involving the nine teams still remaining from the championship, and Newton who had reformed their team began on September 9. On October 28 Mangere defeated Newton 19-11 in the final played at Manukau (Onehunga). On September 16 a Junior rep side made up of players from this grade played against the Wednesday Representative side and lost 16-8. The match was played as a curtain-raiser to the Auckland - New South Wales at Carlaw Park.\nThird grade (Myers Cup).\nPonsonby United won the championship with an undefeated record, beating Kingsland Rovers 9-3 in what was labelled the final, on September 23, although Kingsland had lost at least 3 matches prior to this. A large number of results were unreported though the majority of Ponsonby and Point Chevalier's results were. Manukau defaulted their first two matches and then withdrew so have been omitted from the standings as they did not play a game. City B withdrew after 12 rounds, Devonport and Coromandel Old Boys withdrew after 14 rounds.\nFourth grade.\nRichmond played Otahuhu on September 23 for the championship. The match was drawn 5-5 but Richmond secured the title as they were 1 competition point ahead going into the match. A large number of results were not reported, with just 3 of Otahuhu's reported thus their tally of 6 wins is based purely on the fact that they finished 1 pt behind Richmond. Richmond only had 8 results reported from their 14 scheduled matches. City withdrew after 11 rounds.\nFifth grade (Endean Memorial Shield).\nTakapuna won the championship. It was to be the only grade win for the club in their history which lasted from 1921 to 1925. Richmond had beaten Takapuna 8-3 on July 22 but the match was ordered to be replayed by the league. Takapuna going on to win the title. Richmond defeated Takapuna on September 2 to win the knockout competition. The majority of the results were not reported so the standings are significantly incomplete.\nSixth grade A.\nCity Rovers A won the competition ahead of Richmond and Athletic. A standalone match was played between City and Athletic on September 16 to end the season and this was possible to decide the title. Northcote &amp; Birkenhead Ramblers withdrew after 3 rounds. A large number of the results were not reported.\nSixth grade B.\nAthletic won the competition. The majority of match results were not reported so the standings are significantly incomplete. Athletic only had 3 match results reported and 2 of those were losses. Ponsonby defaulted in round 1 and withdrew from the competition so have not been included in the standings.\nCadet competition.\n22nd Company, based in the City won the competition. They sealed the title when they beat 36th Company (Northcote) with a 13-0 win on September 30. It was slightly confusing as teams went by different names, sometimes being referred to by their company number and sometimes by their geographical location, whilst City were also called \"Athletic\" on occasion. Then on July 8 a team joined the competition simply known as Takapuna. Presumably this was also a cadet side rather than the club team of the same name.\nWednesday Competition.\nOn September 13 a Taxi Drivers side beat Bakers 21-9 at Carlaw Park. A Bakers player (T. McPherson) broke his ankle and was taken home). On September 20 the Post and Telegraph side played against the Wednesday representative team as curtain-raiser to the Auckland Province - New South Wales match at Carlaw Park. Post and Telegraph won 33 to 11 with future New Zealand international Arthur Singe scoring 2 tries and kicking a conversion. Wally Somers was also in the Post and Telegraph side.\nRepresentative season.\nIt was an extremely busy season for the Auckland representative side. They played ten matches in total, while many members of the side also played for the Auckland Provincial team, and an Auckland B team also played a match in Cambridge. Of the ten matches they lost 6 and won 4. The first representative fixture of the season was played on 20 May between Auckland and the Maori team which was preparing to visit Australia and play a series of matches. There were 7,000 in attendance and gate receipts totaled £297 2s 6d. On 19 June the touring Australian Universities Rugby League team arrived in Auckland on board the 'Manuka'. They were welcomed at a function at the Auckland Town Hall by a large assembly of Auckland politicians including the Mayor Mr. J.H. Gunson, and representatives of Auckland Rugby League and the New Zealand League Council. The Australians acquitted themselves well by beating Auckland twice, and losing to them once and a loss to the South Waikato team in Hamilton. The games were played over the space of just 8 days.\nAfter the NZ Māori team returned from their tour of Australia seven members of their team were transferred to the Fire Brigade Club, though only four played in their round 9 match (Pitman, Gardner, Yeats and Te Whata).\nHistory was made on 2 September when Auckland was defeated for the first time in a Northern Union Challenge Cup match. They had held the Cup for over a decade, but had to hand it over when they were defeated by South Auckland 21 to 20 on Carlaw Park in front of a large crowd. On 16 September they met the touring New South Wales team at the Auckland Domain and in front of a huge crowd of 20,000 they went down in a \"tremendously fast and exciting game\" by 45 points to 25.\nAuckland v New Zealand Maori.\nThe Auckland team was not at full strength with 5 players originally selected unable to play. The New Zealand Māori team featured Bill Te Whata who joined the Fire Brigade (formerly Grafton Athletic) team after the tour and then later the Athletic (formerly Maritime) side. Also in the team was Craddock Dufty who became a huge figure in the game in the 1920s and 30s in Auckland where he played over 50 matches for New Zealand and 30 for Auckland, George Paki a long time City Rovers player who also had a stint at Richmond Rovers, and Sam Lowrie who played 149 games for Ponsonby along with several games for New Zealand and Auckland.\nAuckland v Australian Universities.\nThe Australian University team was made up of players from Sydney University and Brisbane University.\nAuckland v Australian Universities.\nBill Stormont injured his knee during the match and was replaced by Ernie Herring. Herring took his place in the starting side for the third match due to the injury.\nAuckland v Australian Universities.\nNelson Bass and Ivan Littlewood were originally named to start however Turner and John McGregor both took their places in the starting lineup.\nAuckland v Cambridge.\nRemarkably 12 of the 13 Auckland players scored points, with 8 separate players scoring tries and 4 others kicking one or more goal. The only player not to register any points for Auckland was second rower, Henry Hawkes.\nCambridge v Auckland B.\nWilliam Southernwood of Ponsonby played for the Auckland B side. He would be tragically killed in a boating accident just prior to the start of the 1923 season which also claimed the lives of three other men. His team mate and New Zealand representative Bill Walsh survived the accident.\nAuckland v New South Wales.\nAuckland played the touring New South Wales team in front of 20,000 spectators at the Auckland Domain but was heavily defeated with Australian legend Frank Burge running in 5 tries. George Davidson replaced his brother Bill Davidson in the starting side, and Lou Brown came on during the first half to replace the injured Frank Delgrosso, while for New South Wales O'Connor replaced Tye who was also injured in the first half.\nAuckland Province v New South Wales.\nA few days after the match with New South Wales an Auckland provincial team took on the touring side. This was the first ever Auckland provincial side which included Auckland club players and also players from the Waikato. The Auckland team was made up entirely of Auckland club players aside from former Auckland player Tim Peckham who was playing at Huntly. They also included Bill Te Whata who had played in Australia for the New Zealand Māori side and recently joined the Fire Brigade club in Auckland. They lost a tight match by 21 points to 20. Frank Burge was ordered off for disputing Wilson's try late in the match."

        "title": "2020 British Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2020 British Grand Prix (officially known as the Formula 1 Pirelli British Grand Prix 2020) was a Formula One motor race held on 2 August 2020 at the Silverstone Circuit in Silverstone, United Kingdom. It was the fourth round of the Formula One World Championship. The event was the seventy-first running of the British Grand Prix as part of the World Championship since . The race was the first of two consecutive Formula One races at Silverstone with the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix following a week later. The defending race winner from the 2019 event, Lewis Hamilton, won the Grand Prix, his third consecutive win of the 2020 season, and Mercedes's fourth.\nBackground.\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe opening rounds of the championship were heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Several Grands Prix were cancelled or postponed after the planned opening round in Australia was called off two days before the race was due to take place; prompting the FIA to draft a new calendar. The British Grand Prix was originally intended to be held on 19 July. When the calendar was redrafted following the pandemic the Hungarian Grand Prix and British Grand Prix had swapped dates with Hungary moving to 19 July and Silverstone taking the 2 August date, the originally planned date of the Hungarian race.\nAlthough there had been doubts over whether Silverstone would be able to host Formula One races due to quarantine measures proposed by the British government; Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, said in a statement that he believed Formula One should be given an exemption. In the end, the British Government did give approval for Formula One to be held at Silverstone. Before the races took place Northamptonshire Police reiterated the importance of fans staying away from Silverstone for public health reasons during the two racing weekends, and warned that strict measures would be in place to stop unauthorised persons from entering the circuit.\nThe addition to the calendar of the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix on 9 August, also at Silverstone, marked the first time in twenty-seven years the United Kingdom had hosted two Formula One races in the same season. The last season to have two British races in a season prior to this was the 1993 season, when Donington Park hosted the European Grand Prix and Silverstone hosted the British Grand Prix. It was later revealed that Silverstone offered to hold as many as 12 races in total during the season. Both the British Grand Prix and the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix were held behind closed doors.\nChampionship standings before the race.\nAfter the third round at the 2020 Hungarian Grand Prix, defending champion Lewis Hamilton, on 63 points, led the championship by five points over his teammate Valtteri Bottas, with Max Verstappen a further 25 points behind. Defending Constructors' Champion Mercedes, with 121 points, led the championship from Red Bull, who had 55. McLaren sat 14 points behind Red Bull in third, and were only one point ahead of fourth-placed Racing Point, who had 40 points, while Ferrari sat 5th on 27 points. Williams were the only team without a point, heading into the race.\nEntrants.\nThe initial driver and team race entry list was identical to the season entry list with no additional stand-in drivers for practice or the race. However, this changed following a positive COVID-19 test for Racing Point driver Sergio Pérez who was ruled out of the Grand Prix. He was replaced by Nico Hülkenberg.\nTyre choices.\nPirelli brought the C1, C2, C3 compound tyres for use in the race, the hardest three compounds available. However, the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix, which was also held at Silverstone the following weekend, used the C2, C3 and C4 selection instead. This aimed to not only create strategic differences between the two races, but also to force the teams to fully make use of practice time on the second weekend, instead of relying on data from the previous week. The idea was instituted after the Mercedes team rejected an alternate plan, for a reverse starting grid to be run on the second weekend.\nPractice.\nRed Bull's Max Verstappen set the fastest time of the first practice session on Friday, followed by the Mercedes of Lewis Hamilton and the Racing Point of Lance Stroll. Nico Hülkenberg, in his first practice session on his return to the sport, set the ninth fastest time. During the session, Alfa Romeo's Antonio Giovinazzi spun at turn 13 and scattered gravel and tyre debris onto the track, causing the session to be red-flagged for 12 minutes whilst the track was cleared. He was investigated and later issued a warning by the race stewards for failing to safely return to the pit lane. Sebastian Vettel was unable to complete any timed laps after his Ferrari suffered an intercooler issue early in the session.\nStroll set the fastest time of the second Friday practice session, followed by the Red Bull of Alexander Albon and the Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas. This session was also red-flagged after Albon spun at turn 15 and collided with the barriers. He was taken to the circuit's medical centre but was later declared fit. Vettel was again forced to miss practice time when a pedal issue restricted his running.\nBottas set the fastest time of Saturday morning practice, followed by Hamilton and Verstappen. Albon was forced to miss most of the session with electrical issues, and Vettel continued to suffer brake pedal problems which curtailed his running on Friday.\nQualifying.\nQ1 and Q2.\nAlthough there was a 60% chance of rain before qualifying, all three parts would prove to be dry. In Q1 (the first part of qualifying), Nicholas Latifi spun on his last lap, exiting the slow turn 7 (Luffield); his earlier time was only good enough for last place. His Williams teammate George Russell was investigated by the stewards for not slowing down under the consequent yellow flags - he received a five-place grid penalty. In the end, the five drivers eliminated in Q1 were Kevin Magnussen, Antonio Giovinazzi, Kimi Räikkönen, Romain Grosjean, and Latifi - as both Giovinazzi and Raikkonen failed to make it out of Q1, Alfa Romeo remained the only team to not reach Q2 (the second part of qualifying) in 2020.\nTwo different strategies were used in Q2, with both the Mercedes, Red Bulls, Racing Points and one of the Ferraris – that of Charles Leclerc – trying to get into Q3 (the third part of qualifying) on the more race-suitable medium compound tyre, and the other teams using the soft compound due to the top ten qualifiers having to start on the tyre used in Q2. Early on in the session, world championship leader Lewis Hamilton spun at turn 7; red flags were soon waved, since Hamilton had brought gravel back onto the track with him. After the session resumed, Hamilton and his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas set times a second clear of the rest of the field. Not all those using the medium tyres succeeded in reaching Q3 - Alexander Albon of Red Bull and Racing Point's replacement driver Nico Hülkenberg both failed to do so. Lance Stroll in 10th and Pierre Gasly in 11th set the same time, but since Stroll set it first, the latter in his AlphaTauri was consigned to going out in Q2. At the end of the session, the drivers eliminated were Gasly, Albon, Hulkenberg, Daniil Kvyat, and Russell.\nQ3.\nAs the cars were being sent out, there was an incident in the pitlane between Leclerc, Stroll, and Daniel Ricciardo, with Stroll complaining that Ferrari had released their driver in an unsafe manner - the stewards, after investigating the matter, decided no further action was necessary. In the first set of laps, Hamilton set the fastest lap time with a 1:24.616, with his teammate 0.15 seconds adrift. Hamilton then improved this time a few minutes later, recording a 1:24:303 to secure pole position, and Bottas achieved second place, 0.3 seconds back. (Note that it is a fastest lap time, but not an official lap record, which can only be set during a race). Max Verstappen, one of the last to cross the line, was third fastest, over a second behind pole position. The rest of the top 10 were: Leclerc, Lando Norris, Stroll, Carlos Sainz Jr., Ricciardo, Esteban Ocon, and Sebastian Vettel.\nThe pole position was Hamilton's 91st overall, and his seventh around the Silverstone circuit.\nRace.\nPre-race ceremonies.\nA 'fight against racism' ceremony was held on the track before the race. All 20 of the drivers were out in formation directly in front of the grid, all displaying anti-racism messages on their t-shirts, and with some taking the knee and others standing, as video messages of their support for the anti-racism message were played.\nFollowing the singing of the national anthem (\"God Save The Queen\"), there was a flyover by a Spitfire with the message \"Thank you NHS\" painted on the underside of its wings, and accompanied by applause from those present, in recognition of the work done by the UK's public health services in the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic.\nRace report.\nPre-race.\nThe Racing Point team was unable to start Nico Hülkenberg’s power unit in the garage, forcing him out of the race prior to the formation lap. This was determined to have been caused by a clutch bolt having sheared off in the drivetrain and, where the bolt jammed, the engine was prevented from turning over.\nEarly laps.\nLewis Hamilton led from pole position at the race start. On the opening lap, Carlos Sainz Jr. and Daniel Ricciardo, starting seventh and eighth respectively, both made up two places by passing Lando Norris and Lance Stroll. 12th-placed Kevin Magnussen hit a kerb at the inside of turn 17, running wide. Alexander Albon then attempted to overtake Magnussen at turn 18, the two cars collided and Magnussen was sent through the gravel and into the barriers. He was uninjured and the safety car was deployed in order to recover his Haas. Albon was later issued a five-second time penalty after the race stewards deemed him responsible for the collision.\nRacing resumed on lap six. At the end of the lap, Albon became the first driver to make a pit stop to change from medium to hard-compound tyres. On lap 12, 12th-placed Daniil Kvyat spun at turn 10 as a result of a right-rear tyre failure and crashed heavily into the barriers on the outside of turn 11. Kvyat walked away from the accident and the safety car was deployed whilst his car was recovered. All drivers except Albon and Romain Grosjean made pit stops during the safety car period, allowing Grosjean to jump to fifth place. The order of the top 10 was now Hamilton, Valtteri Bottas, Max Verstappen, Charles Leclerc, Grosjean, Sainz, Ricciardo, Norris, Stroll and Sebastian Vettel, who had passed Esteban Ocon in the pits after the Renault suffered a slow pit stop.\nMid-race.\nThe second safety car period ended on lap 19. Shortly after the restart, Vettel fell back behind Ocon, and Norris passed Ricciardo for seventh place. Grosjean was soon overtaken by both McLarens, and was shown the black-and-white flag for unsportsmanlike conduct after being judged to have defended too aggressively from Sainz. 14th-placed Albon made a second pit stop on lap 30, the first driver to do so, serving his time penalty and changing to soft-compound tyres. Antonio Giovinazzi was issued a five-second time penalty on lap 36 for speeding under safety car conditions. On the same lap, Grosjean fell to ninth place having been passed by Ricciardo and Stroll. He was again investigated for moving too aggressively whilst defending from Ricciardo, but no action was taken. He made his first pit stop at the end of the lap, falling to the back of the field. On lap 38, Vettel dropped out of the points positions after being passed for 10th place by Pierre Gasly. Ocon passed Stroll for eighth place on lap 46.\nClosing laps.\nIn the closing laps Bottas, who had been running closely behind teammate and race leader Hamilton for the entire race, began to fall back, complaining of poor visibility due to vibrations. Sainz also reported a similar issue over the radio. Kimi Räikkönen, last of the running cars in 17th place, suffered a front wing failure on lap 48 and returned to the pits for a replacement. On the following lap, Gasly passed Stroll for ninth place and Ricciardo overtook Norris for sixth. With three laps to go, Bottas' front-left tyre delaminated. After passing Bottas for second place, Verstappen made use of the gap to Leclerc in third and pitted for fresh tyres to safeguard against suffering a tyre failure himself and in an attempt to claim the fastest lap of the race. This time, 1:27.097, still stands as the lap record to date (even though Hamilton was quicker in Q3). Bottas slowly completed his lap to return to the pits, changed tyres and emerged in 12th place.\nWith two laps to go, Albon, who had worked his way up from the back of the field and was promoted to 10th place by Bottas' pit stop, passed Stroll for ninth place. At the same time, fourth-placed Sainz suffered a front-left tyre failure. He returned to the pits and eventually fell to 14th place by the finish line. After Bottas' puncture, race leader Hamilton was warned over the radio to preserve his tyres. However this proved to be too late as, at turn eight on the final lap, Hamilton became the third driver to suffer a front-left failure. At this point, Hamilton had gained a lead of over 30 seconds after Verstappen's precautionary pit stop, although this gap rapidly fell as Hamilton slowly completed the lap.\nVerstappen could only close the gap to six seconds by the finish line, and Hamilton took the chequered flag to claim his third consecutive victory of the season, 87th career win and his seventh at the British Grand Prix. Verstappen finished second and succeeded in claiming the fastest lap, with Leclerc completing the podium. Ricciardo and Norris finished fourth and fifth, with Ocon claiming his best finish since the 2018 Italian Grand Prix in sixth. Gasly, Albon, Stroll and Vettel rounded out the points positions.\nPost-race.\nOn his lap 12 accident, Kvyat claimed that he was \"very, very distract[ed]\" as issues with his car required him to change settings on his steering wheel immediately prior to the crash. AlphaTauri team principal Franz Tost suggested that Kvyat's accident may have been down to a tyre puncture. Red Bull defended their decision to pit Verstappen in the closing laps, raising the possibility that he could have suffered the same tyre failure as the Mercedes drivers.\nThe tyre failures near the end of the race were investigated by Pirelli (the tyre supplier) and the FIA (the governing body) after the race. The company stated that the tyre failures were generated by two different causes: firstly, the 'extremely long' stints the cars were running on the demanding Silverstone circuit; and secondly, the increased pace of the 2020 cars which maximised the forces on the tyres, with the most stress on the front-left.\nRenault also protested the legality of the Racing Point RP20's brake ducts for a third race in succession. The protest was upheld with Racing Point being reprimanded but the team and drivers allowed to keep their results."

        "text": "The 2019 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup qualifiers for UEFA was a beach soccer tournament contested by European men's national teams who are members of UEFA that determined the five nations from Europe that qualified to the 2019 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup in Paraguay.\nThe event, organised by Beach Soccer Worldwide (BSWW) in cooperation with local entities, the Russian Football Union (RFU), Russian Ministry of Sport (RMoS) and the Government of Moscow, took place in Moscow, Russia from 19–27 July 2019. This also marked the first edition of the event to officially be under the patronage of UEFA, including the confederation's financial support.\nThe tournament was a multi-stage competition, consisting of a first group stage, knockout round, second group stage and finishing with placement matches.\nPoland were the defending champions but were eliminated from title-winning contention in the second group stage, ultimately finishing seventh. The competition was won by hosts Russia who, along with Italy, Belarus, Switzerland and Portugal, earned qualification to the World Cup by finishing in the top five (with the Belarusian team notably qualifying for the first time).\nFormat.\nThe tournament started with a round-robin group stage; the top nations from each group advanced to the round of 16. The eight winners of the round of 16 then advanced to the second round-robin group stage. The top two teams of each group (total of four nations) secured qualification to the World Cup; the winners of each group also advanced to the tournament final to contest the title; the nations finishing in second through fourth played in consolation matches to decide third through eighth place, with the team claiming fifth place also qualifying for the World Cup finals.\nThe format received criticism, being called the \"softest\" configuration in the history of UEFA qualifiers, \"forgiving the mistakes of teams again and again\", that in theory, a team could qualify for the World Cup despite winning just two and yet losing six matches.\nTeams.\n20 teams entered, a figure markedly lower than in recent editions. They are listed below.\nSome notable absentees included England, Romania and Greece (all ranked in the European top 20, present at all previous qualifiers) and the Netherlands who qualified to the World Cup via this event in 2013.\nVenue.\nOne venue was used in the city of Moscow, Russia.\nDraw.\nThe draw to split the 20 teams into five groups of four was conducted by BSWW at the Marriott Hotel in Minsk, Belarus at 10:30 FET on 29 June.\nInitially, all the teams were ordered according to their BSWW World Ranking. The top five teams (incl. the hosts) were seeded and each respectively assigned to position one of one of the groups. The remaining fifteen teams were then split into three pots of five according to their world ranking, with the highest placed in Pot 1 down to the lowest placed in Pot 3.\nFrom each pot, the first team drawn was placed into Group A, the second team drawn placed into Group B and so on. Pot 1 teams were placed in position two, Pot 2 teams in position three and so on.\nThe composition of the seeds and pots is shown below:\nFirst group stage.\nEach team earns three points for a win in regulation time, two points for a win in extra time, one point for a win in a penalty shoot-out, and no points for a defeat. The top three nations and best fourth placed nation from each group advances to the round of 16.\nThe competition format was announced on 16 April when up to 32 teams were expected to participate. Despite only 20 teams ultimately entering, BSWW decided not to change the format. With Ukraine's withdrawal, this means just three teams were eliminated at this stage.\nAll times are local, MSK (UTC+3).\nRound of 16.\nThe round of 16 ties are contested as single elimination matches. The eight winners progress to the second group stage.\nDraw.\nProcedure.\nThe draw took place at press centre of the host stadium immediately following the conclusion of the final match of the first group stage.\nFor the purpose of the draw, the 16 teams were split into four pots of four. The five group winners and three best second placed teams were divided between Pots 1 and 2, based on their BSWW World Ranking, with the highest ranked four placed in Pot 1 and the lowest ranked four in Pot 2. The two worst second placed teams, five third placed and best fourth placed nation were placed in Pots 3 and 4, also divided between pots in the same fashion.\nTeams from Pot 1 were drawn against teams from Pot 4, and Pot 2 nations face those from Pot 3. The drawing of ties alternated as such.\nRanking of second-placed teams.\nThe calculation of best and worst second placed teams was reformulated upon Ukraine's withdrawal, considering the occupants of Group D played just two matches.\nPots.\nThe composition of the four pots is shown below.\nSecond group stage.\nThe eight teams are split into two groups of four: the four winners of ties 3–6 of the round of 16 draw enter Group 1, whilst the four winners of ties 1, 2, 7 and 8 enter Group 2.\nThe teams that finish in the top two of each group earn qualification to the World Cup; those that finish in the corresponding positions of the two groups play against one another to determine the final standings of the tournament. The teams that play in the fifth place play-off will contest the last remaining spot at the World Cup.\nPlay-offs.\nFifth place play-off.\nWinner qualifies for the 2019 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup.\nAwards.\nIndividual awards.\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament.\nTop goalscorers.\n\"Players who scored at least 3 goals are listed\"\nFinal standings.\nQualified teams to the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup.\nThe following five teams from UEFA qualify for the 2019 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup."

        "title": "2019 AMA Supercross Championship",
        "text": "The 2019 AMA Supercross Championship was an American motorcycle racing championship that took place from January 5, 2019 - May 4, 2019 over 17 rounds at various stadiums across the United States.\nCooper Webb, riding a KTM, won the championship in the 450cc class while Dylan Ferrandis won in the 250cc Western Regional class and Chase Sexton won in the 250cc Eastern Regional class.\nSeason Report.\nThe first round of the 2019 AMA Supercross Championship was held in wet conditions in Angel Stadium in Anaheim, California on January 5. Dean Wilson led most of the 450cc Main Event but was passed for the win by Justin Barcia, who won his first race since 2013. Colt Nichols led the entirety of the 250cc Western Regional Main Event to take his first career win.\nGlendale, Arizona played host to Round 2 one week later where Ken Roczen led the 450cc Main Event early until Malcolm Stewart had a crash, bringing out the red flag. After the restart, the lead changed hands twice, from Roczen to defending champion Jason Anderson and then to Blake Baggett, who took his first career 450cc Main Event win. Adam Cianciarulo cruised to victory in the 250cc Western Regional Main Event.\nEventual champion Cooper Webb took his first 450cc career win at Anaheim 2 one week after Glendale, finishing 1st, 1st and 3rd in the three 450cc Main Events in Supercross’s first “Triple Crown” event of the season. The 250cc Western Regional class also saw its third winner in as many races with Shane McElrath placing 3rd, 2nd and 1st in the three 250cc Main Events.\nThe fourth round of the season saw the first repeat winners of 2019 in the 450cc and 250cc Western Regional classes, as Cooper Webb and Adam Cianciarulo took the wins respectively. Webb beat his KTM teammate Marvin Musquin by 0.7 seconds. \nHeavy rain before the fifth race at San Diego led to a track that was “a miserable mess of standing water and deep mud for the racers, and just completing a lap without falling or getting stuck was an accomplishment in itself”. Eli Tomac won the 450cc Main Event while Adam Cianciarulo won the 250cc Main Event. Some riders suffered skin irritation and some bikes were damaged following the race. Feld Entertainment released a statement following the race explaining that “the track crew…. Applied a drying agent, a lime and sand mixture, to treat two areas on the track to try and remove moisture from the dirt… the unprecedented amount of rain on Saturday prevented the lime from mixing with the soil as usual.” Feld offered privateer riders that competed in San Diego $5,000 each as compensation and started looking at other options for drying agents going forward. \nMinneapolis marked the start of the 250cc Eastern Regional season. Cooper Webb won the 450cc Main Event while Austin Forkner won the 250cc Eastern Regional Main Event at both Minneapolis and the next race in Arlington, Texas. The 450cc Main Event in Arlington was particularly memorable as it featured a last-corner pass for the win and the closest finish in Supercross history with Webb edging Ken Roczen to the line by 0.028 seconds.\nDetroit played host to the second Triple Crown race of the 2019 season, with Eli Tomac winning the 450cc event with finishes of 1st, 1st and 6th. The race also saw the 132nd career podium for 36-year-old Chad Reed, his first since 2017. Austin Forkner remained undefeated in 2019 in the 250cc Eastern Regional class, winning all three 250cc Main Events during the night’s show. \nOn March 2, the next round was held in Atlanta where Cooper Webb won the 450cc Main Event and Adam Cianciarulo won overall in the 250cc East/West Shootout. It was the first of two times during the season that the 250cc Eastern and Western Regional classes would race together. While Austin Forkner didn’t win the 250cc Main Event, he remained undefeated in the 250cc Eastern Regional division, beating all of the other East class competitors.\nThe Daytona Supercross was held on a racetrack designed by former Supercross champion Ricky Carmichael on the frontstraight of the Daytona International Speedway. Eli Tomac dominated the 450cc Main Event for his third win of the year, while Austin Forkner returned to his winning ways in the 250cc Eastern Regional Main Event. \nRound 11 saw Marvin Musquin take his first win of 2019 in Indianapolis in the 450cc Main Event, ending an 11-month dry spell, while Austin Forkner won again in the 250cc Eastern Regional class. Musquin would win again at the next round in Seattle, but amid controversy. A crash claiming Chad Reed and Justin Brayton led to a section being lined with red cross flags. Riders are not allowed to jump through red cross flags and, as stated under section 4.16 of the rulebook “during a main event race, if no positions were gained, the penalty will be the points and purse equal to two positions in the final results for that race plus two additional points”. This cost Musquin seven points, but he kept the victory. Dylan Ferrandis took his first career 250cc Main Event win.\nCooper Webb won the third Triple Crown race of the season in the 450cc class with finishes of 2nd, 1st and 3rd in Houston. Webb was also claimed the 2019 Triple Crown Champion. Webb and KTM teammate Marvin Musquin had battled hard during the first main event, with Webb coming out on top. Following his penalty the previous round in Seattle, this result further hurt Musquin’s championship chances. Dylan Ferrandis, fresh off of his first career win in Seattle, followed it up with another win in the 250cc Western Regional class Main Event.\nEli Tomac was the winner of Round 14 of the 450cc season in Nashville, while Martin Davalos won the 250cc Eastern Regional class Main Event, his first win in three years. Davalos’ win came after Austin Forkner - who had been undefeated in 2019 up to that point - crashed in practice and was unable to put weight on his knee. Colorado native Tomac went on to win the next event at his home race in Denver, much to the approval of the crowd, and narrowing the points gap to the championship leader Cooper Webb. The championship battle in the 250cc Western Regional class opened back up a bit though, with Adam Cianciarulo returning to the top step of the podium and extending his points lead over Dylan Ferrandis. \nMistakes led to the lead changing hands many times during the 450cc Main Event in East Rutherford, New Jersey. When the checkered flag finally flew, it was Cooper Webb taking the win, extending his points lead to 23 points with just one race left to go. Forkner came into the race still suffering with a torn ACL from his Nashville crash, but he was able to compete in the 250cc Eastern Regional Main Event. However, he didn’t make it to the finish after jumping and landing into the face of a jump, causing further distress to his knee. This allowed Chase Sexton to go on to take his first 250cc Eastern Regional career win and take the points lead. \nThe final race of the season was held in Las Vegas on May 4, 2019, with all three championships on the line. For the second time during the season, the 250cc Eastern and Western Regional class riders would compete against each other on track in an East/West Shootout. Chase Sexton finished fourth in the 250cc East/West Shootout to take the 250cc Eastern Regional Championship, while Dylan Ferrandis won the 250cc Western Regional Championship by winning while his championship rival Adam Cianciarulo crashed late in the race. Cooper Webb merely needed a 20th-place finish to clinch the 450cc championship. Tomac won while Webb finished third, giving Webb the title."

Contested over 90 laps on the road course, it was the 22nd race of the 2019 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series season.\nReport.\nBackground.\nWatkins Glen International (nicknamed \"The Glen\") is an automobile race track located in Watkins Glen, New York at the southern tip of Seneca Lake. It was long known around the world as the home of the Formula One United States Grand Prix, which it hosted for twenty consecutive years (1961–1980), but the site has been home to road racing of nearly every class, including the World Sportscar Championship, Trans-Am, Can-Am, NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, the International Motor Sports Association and the IndyCar Series.\nInitially, public roads in the village were used for the race course. In 1956 a permanent circuit for the race was built. In 1968 the race was extended to six hours, becoming the 6 Hours of Watkins Glen. The circuit's current layout has more or less been the same since 1971, although a chicane was installed at the uphill Esses in 1975 to slow cars through these corners, where there was a fatality during practice at the 1973 United States Grand Prix. The chicane was removed in 1985, but another chicane called the \"Inner Loop\" was installed in 1992 after J.D.

        "title": "Devin Williams (baseball)",
        "text": "Devin Terran Williams (born September 21, 1994) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He made his MLB debut in 2019 and was named the National League's rookie of the year and relief pitcher of the year in 2020. He was an MLB All-Star in 2022 and 2023.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nWilliams attended Hazelwood West High School in Hazelwood, Missouri. He starred for the school's baseball team and committed to play college baseball for the University of Missouri.\nThe Milwaukee Brewers selected Williams in the second round, with the 54th overall selection, of the 2013 MLB draft. He signed with the Brewers for a $1.35 million signing bonus rather than enroll at the University of Missouri.\nDuring spring training in 2017, Williams tore the ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow. He underwent Tommy John surgery and missed the entire season. In 2019, he was chosen to represent the Brewers at the All-Star Futures Game.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nOn August 5, 2019, the Brewers selected Williams' contract and promoted him to the major leagues. He made his debut on August 7 against the Pittsburgh Pirates at PNC Park. In 13 appearances with the 2019 Brewers, Williams pitched to a 3.95 earned run average (ERA) while striking out 14 batters in innings pitched.\nWilliams was named the NL Reliever of the Month for September 2020. In 13 innings, he surrendered just four hits, no runs and recorded 24 strikeouts. On October 5, 2020, Williams was named MLB Reliever of the Year, capturing 12 of 17 votes. Williams had a breakout year finishing with an ERA of 0.33, surrendering just 18 hits in 27 innings and 53 strikeouts. He struck out over half the batters he faced in 22 appearances. On November 9, 2020, Williams was named the NL Rookie of the Year, becoming the first relief pitcher to win the award since Craig Kimbrel in 2011. His 0.33 ERA was the lowest in a single season with at least 21 innings pitched since earned runs became an official statistic in 1913.\nWilliams returned to the Brewers' bullpen for the 2021 season. After allowing only a single earned run in 14 relief appearances during August, he was named NL Reliever of the Month for the second time. On September 29, 2021, it was announced that Williams would miss the remainder of the season after fracturing his pitching hand after drinking alcohol and punching a wall following the celebrations following the team's NL Central Division title clinch the Sunday before.\nThe Brewers traded Josh Hader, their closer, at the 2022 trade deadline, and Williams succeeded him as their closer. In October 2022, it was announced that Williams intended to represent Team USA in the 2023 World Baseball Classic.\nOn January 13, 2023, Williams agreed to a one-year, $3.35 million contract with the Brewers, avoiding salary arbitration. He had a 1.53 ERA with 36 saves, and won the NL Reliever of the Year award for the second time.\nWilliams signed a one-year contract for the 2024 season worth $7.25 million with a club option for the 2025 season worth $10.5 million. On March 14, 2024, it was announced that Williams would miss roughly three months of action with two stress fractures in his back.\nPitching style.\nWilliams has two primary pitches: a four-seam fastball and a circle changeup with screwball-like movement while rotating the ball off the ring finger during release, which is also similar to a cricket leg-spinner bowling a googly, but at a much faster pace of around 85 mph and with a very high spin-rate of 2,852 rpm. He also has a rarely-used cutter and sinker. In 2020, due to the increased movement on the changeup, he increased its usage and often used it as a strikeout pitch. He refers to his changeup as the \"Airbender,\" a nickname coined by Rob Friedman."

        "text": "Innova Disc Golf is a sports video game developed by Sundial Interactive and published by WizardWorks for Innova Discs. It was released for Microsoft Windows on April 12, 2000.\nGameplay.\n\"Innova Disc Golf\" is played from a first-person perspective. The game is based on disc golf, which plays similarly to regular golf except that the player uses flying discs and aims them at baskets located on the course. The game features four courses, each with 18 baskets. The player can choose to play a full 18 baskets, or just the front 9 or back 9 baskets.\nThe game includes 11 types of discs with different characteristics, each one made by Innova Discs. Some discs fly long and straight, while others curve to the left or right, avoiding hazards such as trees. Some discs are designed for short ranges near the baskets. The player can select the strength, height, tilt, and direction of the disc throw. An overhead map allows the player to track the flight of the disc after it is thrown. A mulligan option allows the player to retake a throw if desired. The game has various multiplayer options, including LAN.\nReception.\n\"Innova Disc Golf\" received generally negative reviews. Gil Alexander Shif of \"GameZone\" wrote, \"Only in the most basic sense is the game fun.\" He considered \"Innova Disc Golf\" to be an \"uncreative and unsatisfying\" recreation of the sport, and a \"mediocre effort.\" Gordon Goble of \"CNET Gamecenter\" stated that the game \"provides only a marginally entertaining experience that lacks much of the thrill of the actual sport\". Mark Kanarick of \"AllGame\" wrote, \"Though fun at times, Disc Golf stands as an average game at best.\" \"IGN\"s Scott Steinberg stated that with no computer-controlled opponents to compete against, \"it's inherent that the only competition is your score.\" Steinberg further stated, \"Trying to perfect one's technique is a lofty, but downright boring goal.\"\nSteinberg also criticized the multiplayer option, writing that \"the chances of finding a buddy that owns the game, let alone wants to play it, are slim to none.\" Shif stated that the only way to play an online multiplayer game \"is if you know someone else who happens to be interested in disc golf and wouldn't mind sitting through a few hours of repetitive play.\" Scott Silverstein of \"The Washington Times\" complained of the game's limited options and courses, and wrote that the game \"tends to lose some of its novelty with its repetitiveness.\" Goble praised the variety of discs and the numerous ways to throw them, but he considered the game unrefined. Shif stated that the system for aiming and throwing discs was \"clunky\", while Kanarick considered it difficult. Kanarick also stated that players would have no choice but to use the mulligan option repeatedly because the discs \"perform so unexpectedly at times\".\nThe graphics were generally criticized. Steinberg wrote that the courses suffered from \"an alarming lack of detail.\" Goble considered the graphics outdated and wrote that the game was \"not ugly per se, but the environments are motionless aside from your flying disc\". Goble also criticized the game's \"unconvincing sense of depth that'll have you questioning whether an object is 100 or 500 yards away.\" Shif described the courses as \"relatively featureless and unexciting\", stating that their environments were stagnant. Silverstein described the graphics as \"just OK\". Kanarick praised the simple graphics, writing that the backgrounds \"are nice enough to maintain interest but not too detailed as to take away from the gameplay.\"\nShif considered the sound to be the game's weakest element, especially the player commentary. Silverstein also considered the sound to be possibly the worst aspect of the game, stating that it \"is practically nonexistent most of the time except for a couple of chirping birds. And when the golfers speak, it's usually something stupid\". Steinberg considered the commentary \"annoying\" and unemotional. Colin Williamson of \"PC Gamer\" wrote, \"The only thing that makes the game worth playing – but only once – is the amazingly bad commentary.\" Kanarick criticized the sound effects and player commentary, calling them both \"too repetitive and annoying.\""

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Thundering Herd represent Marshall University in the NCAA Division I Sun Belt Conference.\nMarshall began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1906. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Marshall's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2021–22 season."

        "text": "The 1890 Southern Rugby Football Union season was the 17th season of the Sydney Rugby Premiership. This was the first competition for the new Agricultural Society Challenge Cup which was awarded to the winners of the premiership. The football season lasted from May to August. For the fourth season in succession, the Sydney University Football Club were declared premiers with the club remaining undefeated.\nTeams.\nThe Agricultural Society Challenge Cup continued to be open to all members of the Southern Rugby Football Union. Also continuing alongside was the Junior Badges for those clubs who chose not to enter the senior competition, and the Union Badges for all remaining clubs and second fifteens of senior or junior clubs. When entries closed on 3 May, 11 teams had entered the senior competition, 11 teams had also entered the Junior Badges and 21 teams had entered the Union Badges.\nNew to the senior competition in 1890 was the Sydney club. The club had been formed at the beginning of the season with some people expecting them to \"lick\" the other teams and come out on top of the table. Out of the four teams that dropped out of the premiership for the new season, only Double Bay survived, deciding to enter the Junior Badges instead. While Strathfield Rovers failed to last the season in 1889, both Newtown and Cammeray folded at the beginning of the current season.\nRule Changes.\nWith representative games interfering with the calendar drawn up for the past seasons, a dedicated finals system had not been in place since 1887. For the new season, the Union decided upon the inclusion of a top-4 finals system. After the closing date for entries into the three badge competitions, the Union drew up the seasons games for the weekend between 31 May and 16 August. It was decided that the teams would be ranked according to points with wins worth 4 points and draws 2 points. Byes were counted as wins. In the event of a tie, teams would be ranked first by points against then points scored. The Union decreed that all games played at Moore Park would begin at 3:00pm with games at suburban grounds beginning at 3:15pm. In addition, games would now consist of two halves of no more than 40 minutes with one umpire decided upon by the teams. With a visiting Queensland team playing two matches in July and a Metropolitan-Western Districts game also played that month, it was decided that all club matches would be postponed until the completion of these representative games.\nFor the coming season, the Agricultural Society of NSW offered a challenge cup to be competed for by the senior clubs. One condition of the offer was that the cup become the property of the club who held the cup for three seasons. They also offered a cheque for purchase of five honour caps to be awarded to the most deserving players of the club that was awarded the cup. The society also requested that all games be played on their ground. The society requested the right to approve the rules and code for the competition. This offer was accepted by the Union with an alteration that not all matches would be played on the Agricultural Ground.\nSeason Summary.\nThe 1890 season was seen as one of the most interesting in recent time. It was believed that due to the presence of competitions for the clubs on three levels, that the state of play had improved with much of the unnecessary roughness stamped out. Crowd interest was increasing with much excitement towards the outcome of the contests. Unfortunately the weather for the matches played during June and July was awful. Rain caused some games to be postponed due to the unsatisfactory state of the grounds and the conditions. As a result, some of the matches were played during mid-week or when the representative matches were being played. However, the same poor weather conditions also interfered with those games as well.\nOnce again, Sydney University A emerged from the season undefeated and rightful premiers. Throughout the season they displayed themselves to be excellent proponents of the game. Their supremacy over their rivals was seen to be due to their thorough knowledge of the scientific parts of the game. They made a science of passing, an important feature of the game. At the beginning of the season JAK Shaw, the captain of the previous three seasons, retired from football. The club also lost the services of point-scoring master, Paddy Flynn who left the Sydney area. Despite these losses, the team performed unselfishly making it hard to point out individual performances. Percy Colquhoun, Harry Abbott, the Belbridge brothers and Leo Neill were the chief scorers.\nFor a consecutive year, Strathfield were runners-up to the Varsity. During the regular games, the club lost only to University A and Sydney. In the semi-final against Parramatta, they easily defeated their opponents to progress to the final. Up until this point the club were considered to be equal to the Varsity in performance. However the final saw the eventual premiers walk all over Strathfield to win the match by a large margin. Strathfield's poor performance in the final was disappointing. Robert Lusk, Henry Braddon and Harry Moses played consistently well for the entire season.\nThe Parramatta Football Club performed well to see themselves in a high position amongst the other senior clubs. The club was in its second year of existence and boasted one of the lightest packs in the competition. Playing a fast and effective game, Parramatta displayed great stamina. The team were only beaten once by the Varsity and played two draws against Arfoma and Sydney.\nThough not as successful as prior seasons, the Arfoma Football Club played well enough to find themselves in the semi-finals. A number of new players were enlisted at the beginning of the season resulting in the overall performance of the team falling short of previous form. Despite this, the Arfoma were only defeated by University A and Strathfield.\nFinals.\nFor the second time in history, and the first time in three years, a final series was included in the competition. At the conclusion of the main round of games, the teams were ranked according to the number of points they had earned. The top four teams progressed to the semi-finals on the 23 August, with the winners of both matches progressing to the final on 30 August. The semi finals were decided by ballot with both games scheduled to play at the Agricultural Society Ground.\nThe largest crowd recorded at a football match was present at the ground for the two semi final clashes. The Arfoma-University game held the most interest, with many hoping for the Varsity to experience defeat. After initially leading the match, Arfoma became demoralised when Sydney University increased their efforts. The final score saw the Varsity win 13 points to 3. The second match saw Strathfield defeat Parramatta 18 points to 4. After this result, some were predicting that Strathfield would give University a lot of trouble in the final.\nFinal, 30 August.\nThe final match for the inaugural Agricultural Society Challenge Cup was played on 30 August between Sydney University A and Strathfield. Approximately 4000 to 5000 people were in attendance to watch the contest with many predicting Strathfield to cause trouble for the undefeated Varsity. After a short delay, the game began and it wasn't too long before Strathfield scored through the efforts of Harry Moses. University raised their efforts and confined play for a while at the Strathfield end where two unanswered tries were scored. At halftime, the score showed the Varsity leading 8 points to 3. Immediately play began again with no half time rest taken. University maintained their onslaught upon the Strathfield line. The second half was almost entirely one sided with University scoring freely. The Varsity added 5 tries and a goal from the field to lift the score to 31 points to 3. In the last moments of the match Lusk bolted away and scored for Strathfield to bring their final score to 6 points. The final score was a surprise to most in attendance. As was usual, the Varsity players worked together like machinery displaying excellent passing. Percy Colquhoun scored 16 points during the game. Strathfield fumbled the ball and played a messy game. With this win the university maintained their four-year unbeaten run in the Sydney Rugby Premiership.\nLower Grades.\nJunior Badges.\nFor the new season, the Junior Badges followed much of the same format as the senior competition. This was the fourth time that a competition was held for the Junior clubs. After entries closed, the eleven teams were included in a draw that covered the same period as the seniors. Teams were ranked according to points with the top four progressing to the semi-finals. For the competition, fifteen silver medals were offered by Mr AJ Torning to be awarded to the winners of the junior final. At the conclusion of the regular rounds, Wentworth finished at the top of the table with the Pirates, Eurotah and Oxford qualifying for the semi-finals. Both the Pirates and Wentworth won their respective matches to proceed to the final for the Junior Badges. The final saw one of the most exciting and fiercely contest matches on the Agricultural Ground with both teams of equal footing. Wentworth won the match 4 points to 3 to awarded the Junior Badges.\nUnion Badges.\nSeason 1890 saw the third competition for the Union Badges. As per previous seasons, clubs that chose not to participate in the Senior or Junior competitions and second teams for other clubs could participate. Any player who played in three or more games in the higher badges were not eligible to play in the Union Badges. Despite having 21 teams involved in the competition, the draw saw matches play the same span of weekends as the Senior Badges. When the regular games were completed, Glebe finished at the top of the table with Fort Street College, University 3rd and Clifton qualifying for the semi-finals. In the semi-finals Fort Street College easily defeated Clifton to proceed to the final. Glebe drew with University 3rd in the second semi final. A replay match was organised midweek which was won by Glebe. From the moment that the final began, it was clear that Fort Street were completely outclassed. Glebe defeated Fort Street 26 points to nil to win the badges.\nRepresentative Games.\nIntercolonial Matches.\nThe month of July saw two Intercolonial Matches played between New South Wales and Queensland on the Association Cricket Ground. The first match, played under fine weather, saw a bit of a one-sided affair. In front of a healthy crowd, the local team defeated the visitors 15 points to 3. The second match only a week later saw disagreeable weather with rain falling almost until the beginning of the match. After almost being called off, the game went ahead with a healthy crowd. The contest was a tight affair with both teams playing a fast a skilful game. Both teams failed to score in the wet a slippery conditions with the match ending in a draw."

The Netherlands in the group stage encountered world champion Norway, European champion Germany, and England. In their home games, the Netherlands won 1–0 against Germany and 2–1 against England, and reached a goalless draw against Norway, but lost all three away games and placed third ahead of England.\n2003 World Cup.\nFor the 2003 World Cup, the Netherlands faced Germany and England again in qualification, as well as Portugal for the first time. The Netherlands started with a 0–0 draw in England, but then lost four games before they won against Portugal in the final game, resulting in third place overall.

This was followed by three games that ended 4-0: In England with four goals for England, as well as in the two home games with four goals for the Netherlands against Austria and Hungary.\n2011 World Cup.\nIn March 2010, Roger Reijners took over as the national team coach from Vera Pauw, who had coached the Netherlands since 2004, and was fired over differences with the association's leadership. At the draw for qualification they were tied with Norway again. Other opponents were Belarus, Slovakia, and Macedonia. The Netherlands started with a 0–3 loss in Norway. They followed up with the 13–1 against Macedonia, one of their two highest international wins, and a 1–1 against Belarus.

They won the first qualifier against Norway with 1–0, won against Slovakia with 5–0, and drew against Ireland with 0–0. Despite victories in the other games, a 1–2 defeat in Norway on the final day ensured they only finished second in the group and Norway qualified as group winners directly for the 2019 World Cup. As the best runner-up however, the Netherlands qualified for the playoffs of the four best runners-up. In the semi-final against Denmark, the Netherlands were victorious with two wins (2-0 and 2–1).

        "title": "Japan at the FIFA Women's World Cup",
        "text": " \nThe Japan women's national football team has represented Japan at the FIFA Women's World Cup on nine occasions in 1991, 1995, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2011, 2015, 2019 and 2023. They are the only Asian team to have won the tournament, as well as the only Asian team to qualify for every edition, and they are the first team that has won the trophy with a loss during the final tournament. They also were runners-up once.\n1991 World Cup.\nThe Japanese national team had qualified for the first World Cup as the runners up of the 1991 Asian Championship. Four wins in the preliminary round against Korea DPR, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore. In the semi-final, penalty shoot-out was necessary to eliminate the Republic of China and qualify for the World Cup. The final was then lost with 0: 5 against the China women's national football team, but the first World Cup participation was already there for sure.\nIn People's Republic of China, the first World Cup match on November 17, 1991, in Foshan was lost 1-0 to Brazil. Two days later, they were followed by a 0-8 against Sweden and another 0-3 against the United States women's national soccer team two days later. This was Japan as the worst team of the tournament eliminated.\n1995 World Cup.\nFour years later, the Japanese team finished second in Asian Games 1994 in Hiroshima for the second World Cup. Japan, the Republic of China, the People's Republic of China and South Korea met in a group of four. After a 1-1 draw against the People's Republic of China, both won against the other two teams and then met again in the final, the Chinese won 2-0. Both finalists drove to the World Cup, which took place for the first time on European soil.\nIn Sweden, the Japanese lost again the opening game 0-1, this time against Germany. On June 7, 1995, but then succeeded the Japanese women in Karlstad against Brazil the first World Cup victory. In the process, Akemi Noda get the first two World Cup goals for Japan after a 1-0 deficit. Against Sweden followed then, although a 0-2, but as the second best group Knights reached the Japanese women the quarterfinals. Here followed a 0-4 defeat against defending USA. However, as the eighth best team, Japan had qualified for the women's first football tournament at the Olympic Games, in which only the eight best teams of the World Cup could participate The seventh best team was not allowed to play in the Olympics, Brazil could participate as the ninth best team .\n1999 World Cup.\nFor the third World Cup, Japan finished third in the 1997 AFC Women's Championship. After three preliminary round victories against India, Hong Kong and Guam, with the 21: 0 against Guam the highest international victory succeeded, Japan failed in the semifinals 0-1 North Korea. With a 2: 0 against the Republic of China in the match for third place succeeded but the qualification.\nIn the USA, the Japanese faced Canada in the first game and scored 1-1. But then followed two defeats against Russia (0: 5) and defending champion Norway (0: 4), which eliminated Japan as group last.\n2003 World Cup.\nActually, the World Cup should take place again in the People's Republic of China. Due to the SARS epidemic, the tournament was temporarily relocated to the United States. Thus the World Cup took place for the second time in the USA. As the number of starting places was increased from 12 to 16, a fourth Asian team had the chance to qualify in the AFC / CONCACAF playoffs. Japan took advantage of this opportunity after only fourth place in the Asian Cup 2003. There, the Japanese had the preliminary round against Myanmar, the Republic of China, the Philippines and Guam still with four wins and 34 : 0 goals completed in the semi-finals and match for third place but lost to North Korea 0-3 and South Korea 0-1. In the playoffs, they met Mexico and reached 2: 2 in Mexico City. The second leg in Tokyo was won 2-0 seven days later.\nIn the USA, the Japanese met in the opening match on World Cup newcomer Argentina and reached the highest score in a World Cup match with the 6-0. The later record national player and goal scorer Homare Sawa scored the first two goals,\nMio even got three. Against the later world champion Germany followed then but a 0-3 and against Canada a 1-3. With that, Japan became only a group third. However, since after the increase of the field of participants only all group winners and second came in the knockout round, Japan retired as second best group third.\n2007 World Cup.\nFour years later, Japan had to go through the playoffs. At 2006 AFC Women's Asian Cup in Australia, which has been part of the Asian Association since 2006, only fourth place was taken. After three wins in the preliminary round against the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China and Vietnam became the semi-final against hosts Australia 0-2 and also the game for place 3 against North Korea 2: 3 lost. Again Mexico were in the playoffs of the opponents and this time Japan had first home right. In Tokyo, a 2-0 was submitted, so that the 1: 2 could be dealt a week later in Toluca.\nIn China, as four years earlier, Argentina and Germany were the group opponents, as well as for the first time England, against which in the first game a 2: 2 was achieved. After a 1-0 win over Argentina, Japan and defending champions Germany had both four points ahead of the final group game, ahead of England, who had drawn twice. However, as Japan lost 2-0 to Germany, while England beat Argentina 6-1, Germany became the group winners and then again World Champions and England ahead of Japan's runners-up, who eliminated them.\n2011 World Cup.\nFor the World Cup in Germany, Japan qualified again without detour. At 2010 Asian Cup, for which Japan was directly qualified, third place was taken. The preliminary round was again sovereign with three wins over North Korea, Thailand and Myanmar. In the semifinals, however, was then lost to the eventual Asian champion Australia 0-1. With a 2: 0 in the match for third place against arch-rivals China succeeded but the qualification. As the fourth-placed Asian team this time had no way to qualify for intercontinental playoffs, the first women's World Cup final without the People's Republic of China took place.\nIn Germany, Japan met New Zealand in the first match and won 2-1. This was followed by a 4-0 win over Mexico, with Homare Sawa scoring three goals. Thus, Japan was already qualified before the last group match for the knockout round, so that the subsequent 0-2 defeat against England could be coped. However, Japan was only second to the group and met in the quarterfinals host and defending champion Germany, who wanted to win the title for the third consecutive year the title and against whom Japan had never won before. Despite stormy attacks, the German team managed in 120 minutes but no goal, but could Karina Maruyama in the 108th minute a counterattack to 1: 0 and thus complete the first victory over Germany and reach the semi-finals of a World Cup for the first time. In the semifinals, Japan met Sweden and was already 10 minutes behind, but equalized eight minutes later. It remained until the half-time break. In the second half, the Japanese could then add two more goals and reach the final. Here they met United States, against whom they had never won before, and were again defeated again, this time by a counterattack against them. This could be compensated in the 81st minute, which gave it an extension. Again, the Japanese fell behind in the back. However, Homare Sawa was able to equalize with her fifth tournament goal, making her the tournament's top scorer three minutes from the end of extra time. Although Azusa Iwashimizu received the Red Card in injury time, it stayed that way, so Penalties had to decide on the World Cup title. As Japanese goalkeeper Ayumi Kaihori was only 170 cm tall and held two penalties for the US and also scored one while three Japanese women converted and only one failed, Japan became the first Asian side to become World Cup champions. Homare Sawa was also awarded the Golden Ball for best player and Japan for the fairest team.\n2015 World Cup.\nQualification, which was again hosted by Asian Cup, Japan was the first Asian champion. In the preliminary round were clearly beaten after a draw against Australia, Vietnam and Jordan (4: 0 and 7: 0). In the semifinals, Japan won 2-1 after extra time against the People's Republic of China and won 1-0 in the final.\nWhen the groups were drawn, Japan was set and was defined as group head of group C. The Japanese have been awarded the three World Cup newcomers Switzerland, Cameroon and Ecuador which Japan had not played before.\nJapan could won all three group matches for the first time and moved in as a group winners in the quarterfinals. The goals were all in the first half hour and then the Japanese were content to largely manage the result. Also in the last sixteen against the Netherlands they went early in the lead, but then put in the second half still a goal. In injury time, they still conceded the goal, but this time brought the result over time. Against Australia – against which they had become Asia champions 1-0 for the first time Asian champions - they had to wait but then until the 87th minute before then the winning goal and thus the second semi-final entry succeeded. There they met England, against which four years earlier in the preliminary round last time a World Cup match was lost and never won. In a balanced game, both were awarded a penalty, which they could transform. Thereafter, the mutual efforts to achieve the winning goal were fruitless. Only in stoppage time did the Laura Bassett make an own goal, which allowed her to make her final rerun of 2011. In the final, the Japanese fell behind with 0: 2 already after five minutes, after 16 minutes it was 0: 4, so the game was almost decided. Although the Japanese managed to make tactical changes and substitutions of two players before the break, and a a. Record national player Homare Sawa the 1: 4. When shortly after the break, the United States gave the Japanese an own goal, came up briefly hope again, but already two minutes later fell to the 2: 5-final. Thus, Japan could not imitate the German team and not defend the title. Aya Miyama was awarded the bronze ball as the third best player.\n2019 World Cup.\nIn the Qualification for the World Cup in France, for which Asian women were again given five starting positions, Japan qualified by reaching the semi-finals of the 2018 AFC Women's Asian Cup. For this championship, which takes place in April 2018 in Jordan, Japan was automatically qualified. In the first game against Vietnam, a 4-0 was achieved, the second game against South Korea ended goalless. In the decisive third group match against Australia, which also drew 0-0 against South Korea but won 8-0 against Vietnam, Japan were 1-0 ahead after 63 minutes and would have been group winners in that event. However, four minutes before the end of the game, Sam Kerr scored the 1-1 draw for Australia, and as they stayed 4-0 in South Korea's parallel with Vietnam, Japan were second in the Asian Cup semi-finals also reached the World Cup finals. In the semifinals, Japan defeated China 3-1 and defended their title 1-0 in the final against Australia.\nAt the World Cup, the Japanese, as in 2007, met Argentina and England, and for the first time in a World Cup match, the World Cup newcomer Scotland. The Japanese started with a disappointing goalless draw against Argentina, the first time they could win a championship point. Against Scotland they increased and won 2-1. Against England they had few chances to score and lost 0-2. As Argentina and Scotland drew in a draw, it was enough for the second group place, which they met in the second round of the European Championship Netherlands. The Japanese were already in the 17th minute after a corner in the back, but could then make the game but balanced and became more dominant with increasing time, but needed until the 43rd Minute equalizer. In the second half, they were the better team, but could not use their scoring chances. When the teams were already prepared for an extension, there was a penalty in the final minute for the Dutch women, they used to victory goal. Thus, the Japanese eliminated as the last Asian team, which is the first time no Asian team in the quarter-finals, as previously Australia and China have lost their first knockout round games against European teams and South Korea and Thailand have already eliminated in the group stage."

In their final elimination round game, they defeated Lyceum, the last team to win all 18 elimination round games, in 2017. This allowed the Red Lions to advance to the Finals outright, while modifying the usual Final Four format to a stepladder one. The Red Lions, who last finished the elimination round undefeated in 2010, advanced to their 14th consecutive Finals appearance. The Pirates finished second, awaiting the winning of the first round of stepladder semifinals.\nThe final participant of the Final Four was determined the following day.

        "text": "The 2019 Breeders' Cup Challenge series consisted of 86 horse races that provided the respective winners with an automatic \"Win and You're In\" Berth in the 2019 Breeders' Cup, held on November 1 and 2. Races were chosen by the Breeders' Cup organization and included key races in the various Breeders' Cup divisions from around the world. The Breeders' Cup organization paid the Breeders' Cup entry fee for the challenge race winners, provided they had been nominated as foals.\nSummary.\nThe 2019 Breeders' Cup Challenge series consisted of 86 races, 64 of which were Grade/Group One, from across 11 countries. There were 7 new races from the 2018 Series: the Gran Premio International Carlos Pellegrini (Turf), Prix Morny (Juvenile Turf Sprint), Fourstardave (Mile), Jockey Club Derby (Turf), the Kentucky Downs Turf Sprint (Turf Sprint), Cotillion (Distaff), Prix de l'Abbaye de Longchamp (Turf Sprint) and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe (Turf). The following races were removed from the series: Doncaster Mile, Legacy Stakes, Gran Premio 25 de Mayo, Highlander, Forego, Spinaway, and Joe Hirsch Turf Classic. The International Stakes, formerly a qualifier for the Turf, became the first ever European qualifier for the Classic.\nOn October 21, fifty of the Challenge race winners were pre-entered in one or more of the Breeders' Cup races. Shortly before entries were taken, Magical – a leading contender in the Turf – was retired after spiking a fever.\nEntries were taken on October 28. Several challenge race winners opted to enter a different division of the Breeders' Cup. For example, Omaha Beach, who qualified for the Sprint by winning the Santa Anita Sprint Championship, was instead entered in the Dirt Mile. Conversely, Catalina Cruiser and Mitole qualified for the Dirt Mile but instead were entered in the Sprint. Uni ran in the Mile instead of the Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Turf. Elate was entered in the Classic after qualifying in the Distaff.\nOn Friday, two automatic qualifiers won their respective division of the Breeders' Cup. On Saturday, there were another three:\nMitole, who qualified for the Dirt Mile by winning the Metropolitan Handicap, won the Sprint. Uni won the Mile after qualifying in the First Lady Stakes for the Filly and Mare Turf.\nChallenge Series races.\nThe following table shows the Breeders' Cup Challenge races for 2019 and the respective winners. The status column shows whether the horse was subsequently entered in the corresponding Breeders' Cup race, and whether they finished in the money.\nTelevision coverage.\nFor the 2019 Breeders' Cup Challenge, NBCSN will produce 11 live broadcasts, covering more than 20 of the races in North America. The races will also be live streamed. This is in addition to NBC's coverage of the American Triple Crown series and Royal Ascot, the latter of which has four Breeders' Cup Challenge races."

        "title": "Equestrian Portrait of Cornelis and Michiel Pompe van Meerdervoort with Their Tutor and Coachman",
        "text": "Equestrian Portrait of Cornelis and Michiel Pompe van Meerdervoort with Their Tutor and Coachman, also known as Starting for the Hunt, is an oil-on-canvas painting executed ca. 1652–53 by Aelbert Cuyp, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\nCuyp mainly painted landscapes, but these often included anonymous riders in compositions similar to this. By contrast, few of his paintings are portraits. This portrait is an early example of an equestrian portrait of someone who was not a member of court; previously, equestrian portraits had been restricted to only the high nobility and royalty, but in this period in the Netherlands, this was changing, and Cuyp and his father, Jacob Gerritszoon Cuyp, led this change, with the encouragement of Cornelis van Beveren.\nThe painting shows two young men, brothers Cornelis Pompe van Meerdervoort (left) and Michiel Pompe van Meerdervoort, with their tutor, Caulier, their coachman, Willem, and dogs. In the background of the image, there is a ruined castle, likely intended to indicate the ancient lineage of those pictured. The castle does not look like the Huis te Meerdervoort, the family home of the Pompe van Meerdervoort, located across the Oude Maas from Dordrecht and to the south of Zwijndrecht. The castle was originally painted in the left middleground, before it was repainted on the right. In the left of the background, sailboats can be seen on the river Rhine and the churches and associated buildings of Hoog-Elten, Rindern, and Laag-Elten.\nDetails.\nThe background is believed to have been sourced from Cuyp's \"Drawing of Rhine near Elten\". Despite this background, there is no known connection between the Pompe van Meerdervoort family and that region. However, a 1994 guide to the Met notes that the landscape near Elten is similar to that of Dordrecht.\nThe dogs are believed to be greyhounds and foxhounds, while the animal on the left of the painting is thought to be a hare. The clothing worn by those pictured would not have been common in the Netherlands and has been described as both Hungarian and Persian. The two boys and their riding instructor are wearing tight-fitting coats, known as dolmans, while the coachman is wearing a looser and heavier coat, known as a mente. The cap worn by Cornelis is similar to a Turkish turban. It has been observed that the heads of the figures are awkwardly painted and this had been attributed to Cuyp's primary focus on landscape painting. The hand gesture of Caulier was originally simply a direction, but would later have been viewed as an indication of who would quickly become the sole heir of the close family.\nProvenance.\nIt is most likely that the painting was commissioned by Adriana van Beveren, the widowed mother of the two young men, who is known to have been the first owner of the painting. However, it is also possible that the painting was commissioned by their uncle, Matthijs van Slingelandt, or her father, Cornelis van Beveren. After the death of Adriana van Beveren, it passed to Cornelis Pompe van Meerdervoort. It then was passed down through the family with the Huis te Meerdervoort until 1806, when it was sold by Christina Elisabeth Pompe van Meerdervoort, the great granddaughter of Cornelis. It was sold on August 20, 1806 in The Hague as \"Hunting Party with Three Men on Horses and a Hunter with Dogs in Foreground\" for 695 Dutch guilders.\nOn April 19–20, 1825, it was sold at the Galerie Lebrun in Paris as \"Le Partie de Chasse\" for 17,950 French francs. On May 1–2, 1829, it was sold in London as \"La Partie de Chasse du Prince d'Orange\" for £1,102.10. On June 17, 1848, it was sold at Christie's in London as \"Prince of Orange on a grey horse\" for £556.10. On May 9–10, 1895, it was again sold at Christie's as \"The Prince of Orange, with his sons, prepared to depart for the Chase\" for £2,100. On June 9, 1911, it was sold at the Galerie Georges Petit in Paris as \"Départ pour la chasse\" for either 160,000 or 170,000 francs. On June 14, 1913, it was again sold at the Galerie Georges Petit for 145,000 francs. On June 23, 1922, it was sold for the final time at the Galerie Georges Petit for 62,000 francs to Michael Friedsam, who held it until his death, at which time it was bequeathed to the Met. Since being acquired by the Met, it has been exhibited in many other museums in the United States and the Netherlands, including the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C., the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Dordrechts Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston."

In 1922, James made 16 appearances for the club as they finished second on the table again behind North Sydney.

Norway has a men’s, women’s and junior nation team.\nGoverning body.\nThe Norwegian Ice Hockey Association governs ice hockey in the country. It was founded on September 18, 1934 and became a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) on January 20, 1935.\nHistory.\nIce hockey in Norway has been played since 1930. The first official match was played on 19 February 1933 when SFK Trygg won against Sportsklubben Rapp 4-1 in a break during WC on skates 1933 in Trondheim and Norway. On 16 September 1934, the Norwegian Ice Hockey Association was formed. The 1958 Ice Hockey World Championships in Oslo and 1999 Men's Ice Hockey World Championships were held on Norway 1 May &amp; ; 16 May and the matches were played in Oslo (Jordal Amfi), Hamar (CC Amfi) and Lillehammer (Håkon Hall ). and 1952 in Oslo, 1994 in Lillehammer.\nThe sport is administered by Norwegian Ice Hockey Association (NIHF). Ice hockey in Norway is divided into the performance series (Fjordkraftligaen and 1st division) and the exercise series (2nd division and down).\nDomestic Leagues.\nFjordkraftligaen.\nFjordkraftligaen is the top professional men's division for ice hockey in Norway and is administered by Norwegian Ice Hockey Association. In the Champions Hockey League, where sponsor names are illegal, the official name is Ligaen. The power sales company Fjordkraft has been the main sponsor of the league since the 2020/21 season. The league's name was the GET ligaen from 2007 until the name change in 2020. The series has previously had the names \" Hovederien \" (1934/35 - 1960 / 61), \" 1. division \" (1961/62 - 1989/90), \" Eliteserien \" (1990/91 - 2003/04) and the \"UPC ligaen\" (2004 / 05 - 2006/07) and GET-Ligaen (2007/08 - 2019 / 20).\nThe Fjordkraft league consists of 10 teams that play five matches against each opponent during the season, which extends from autumn to spring. Thus, each team plays 45 matches during a season. The teams are ranked according to the number of points (three for victory in ordinary time, two for victory in overtime, one for loss in overtime, and zero for loss in ordinary time) at the end of the season. If two or more teams end up with the same score, the placement is determined by mutual results.\nThe winner is chosen as league champion, and qualifies together with the next seven teams for Norwegian championship. The two weakest placed teams at the end of the season must play qualify for the GET league against the teams that end up in the top two places in the 1. division.\nDivision 1.\n1. men's ice hockey divisionis the second highest division in ice hockey in Norway after Fjordkraftligaen. 1st division was the name of Norwegian ice hockey's top division from 1961/62 to 1989/90, before it was named the Elite Series (1990 / 91-2003 / 04), the UPC ligaen (2004 / 05-2006 / 07), the Get Liagen (2007 / 08-2019 / 20) and Fjordkraftligaen (2020 / 21-).\nTo play in the 1st division, qualifying rounds must be played with the two worst in the 1st division and the two best teams in the 2nd division. Until Season 2011/12, no license was needed to play in the 1st division. The teams still had to apply Norwegian Ice Hockey Association for approval to play in the league.\nPromotion.\nIt is not possible to move directly up to Fjordkraftligaen. The two best teams from the 1st division and the two worst from the GET-ligaen play an internal league game with home and away matches. The two teams with the most points will play in the GET-ligaen next season, while the two worst must play in the 1st division. From the 2020/21 season, the four best from the basic game in the 1st division will play internally for the two places in the qualification.\nRelegation.\nIt is not possible to move directly down to Norwegian Second Division.

The two best of these four teams advance.\nNorwegians in the NHL.\nMats Zuccarello is considered one of the most talented if not greatest Norwegian ice hockey player of all time. Only 8 Norwegians have played in the NHL.\nNational team.\nNorway's men's national ice hockey team is the national ice hockey team of Norway, and represents the country in international ice hockey tournaments. The national team is administered by the Norwegian Ice Hockey Federation (NIHF), which was established in 1934. Norway has been a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) since 1935.\nNorway has not won any medals in the World Championships or Olympics.\n The first international match was played in the 1937 World Cup in Great Britain, and after an initial period of moderate success, Norway lagged behind the other top nations, and from the mid-1960s they ended up permanently in the B-World Cup. Most of the 1970s and 1980s were spent in the B-WC (with some shorter stays in the C-WC), but in 1989 Norway won the B-group in the WC at home and thus moved up to the A-WC again. After relegation in 2001, Norway relegated to the top division (the former A-VM) in 2005.\nSince then, Norway's results have steadily improved: Norway qualified for the quarterfinals of the Ice Hockey World Championships in 2008, 2011 and 2012, and qualified for Winter Olympics in 2010, 2014 and 2018 . Among the biggest singles matches in recent times are the victory over Canada in the 2000 World Cup, the victory over the Czech Republic in the 2010 World Cup, Sweden in the 2011 World Cup, Germany in the 2012 World Cup and the quarterfinals in 2008, 2011 and 2012.\nNorway women's national ice hockey team has won a championship medal, European Championship bronze in 1993."

        "title": "1920 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The Auckland Rugby League was in its 12th season.\nOn 25 March, North Shore Albions held a meeting to discuss whether they should amalgamate with Sunnyside League Football Club, who were also based in Devonport and had been in existence since 1914. The following week both clubs agreed to merge. After some debate they decided their club name would be 'Devonport United' and they would wear green and white broad bands. In addition Grafton and Richmond Rovers amalgamated, while new clubs were also formed in Kingsland (Kingsland Rovers), and at Point Chevalier.\nFirst grade games continued to regularly draw large crowds, especially matches involving the likes of Maritime, City Rovers, and Ponsonby United. The round 6 match between Maritime and Ponsonby drew what was thought to be a record crowd for a club match in Auckland of 9,000. Maritime would go on to win the first grade title for the first time after a strong season where they won nine games and were only defeated twice. They were awarded the Monteith Shield at the 1921 annual general meeting while Newton Rangers won the Roope Rooster for the second year in a row by defeating Maritime in the final.\nThe highlight of the year was the match between Auckland and the touring England team on 24 July. A crowd of 30,000 packed into the Auckland Domain to witness an Auckland win by 24 points to 16.\n \n \nClub news.\nClub teams by grade participation.\nThe Grafton and Richmond clubs fielded combined teams in the 4th, 5th (2), and 6th grades hence the 'half numbers'.\nCarlaw Park site found.\nAt the end of the season an inspection was made of the site where Carlaw Park would emerge. It was decided that the ground would be named ‘Carlaw Athletic Park’. The land had been purchased years earlier. It was noted that the site was “excellently situated for the purpose for which it is intended, and provides sufficient space for two playing grounds. Natural slopes on two sides will give room for a large number of spectators…”.\nMonteith Shield (first grade championship).\nMaritime won the first grade title with City Rovers finishing in second position. Three grounds were used for the competition, Victoria Park, the Auckland Domain, and the Devonport Domain. Thirty eight matches were played which was the most in the competitions history to this point. Unlike in previous seasons all clubs were able to survive until the end of the season and fulfill the majority, or all, of their fixture obligations.\nMonteith Shield standings.\n(*) Two of Grafton's defeats were by default, while one of Marist's wins and one of Devonport's wins were by default.\nMonteith Shield fixtures.\nRound 1.\n Wally Somers scored for Newton in their win over Grafton. The Marist club took the field in their familiar green colour after having played their first senior season in 1919 season wearing blue jerseys.\nRound 2.\nThe draw by Marist saw them accrue their first ever first grade championship point after going through the 1919 season win-less in the same competition.\nRound 4.\nMarist recorded their first ever victory in the first grade championship with Bill Stormont scoring one of their three tries.\nRound 5.\nThe match between City and Grafton had the score reported by both the Auckland Star and the New Zealand Herald but had no match report and scoring. The Observer had a brief description of the match where they described one of Karl Ifwersen's \"tries\" indicating he scored at least 2.\nRound 6.\nArthur Cadman was sent off in the Maritime match versus Ponsonby for kicking a Maritime player, while the Auckland Star suggested in their match reports that the 9,000 in attendance was possibly the largest ever Auckland Club Rugby League crowd to attend a match to this point. Grafton defaulted their match against Devonport as Joe Bennett was injured, Karl Ifwersen was sick, Horace Neal had a \"broken shoulder\", and Owen, Moir, and Norton were out of town.\nRound 7.\n2 Players were ordered off in the 2nd half of the Maritime versus Newton match. While in the Grafton v Ponsonby match Grafton had two players ordered off including Horace Neal, and had another injured meaning they finished the match with just 10 players on the field.\nRound 11.\nThe City v Grafton match resulted in a 66–13 win to City but the Auckland Star and New Zealand Herald did not report any of the scoring details. Grafton were missing Karl Ifwersen, Joe Bennett, and Charles Woolley who were on representative duty and could only field 11 players.\nRoope Rooster knockout competition.\nThe Roope Rooster began on 28 August with 3 first round matches and Ponsonby United receiving a bye. Newton Rangers defeated Maritime in the final for the second consecutive year.\nTop try scorers and point scorers.\nThe following point scoring lists include Senior Championship matches and the Roope Rooster competition matches only. The lists are extremely incomplete for players from the City Rovers club who had no scoring whatsoever for their 24–17 win over Grafton Athletic, and their 66–13 win over the same opponents. In total the City team was missing the scorers of 112 of its points. Likewise Devonport United was missing scorers for 7 points, Newton Rangers for 13, Maritime for 3, Marist Old Boys for 15, and Grafton Athletic for 30 (from the two matches with City). In addition to this a number of teams featured brothers and often there was no distinction made as to which of the Grey brothers of Maritime it was. Harry Grey scored 4 tries, while Eric Grey was credited with 3, along with 2 conversions, however \"Grey\" was credited with 8 tries, 1 conversion, 1 penalty, and a drop goal which could have been either of the aforementioned players in each instance. Also Ponsonby had a try and conversion credited to McGregor but they could have been scored by either Eric McGregor or brother Dougie McGregor.\nBill Davidson replicated the feat of his younger brother George of the previous season by leading the point scoring while playing for Maritime. George had qualified for the Antwerp Olympics where he ran 5th in the 200m final and did not play in the Auckland Rugby League competition at all in 1920. He was to return and join his brothers in the City Rovers team from the 1921 season onwards.\nThacker Shield.\nPonsonby United defended the Thacker Shield from Federal (of Christchurch) at Victoria Park in front of 10,000 spectators. They had won the shield from Sydenham in Christchurch two years earlier. They had been unable to arrange a defence in the 1919 season. Eventually the shield was to be returned to Christchurch and played for amongst teams in the South Island.\nOther club matches and lower grades.\nLower grade teams and clubs.\nThere were 5 lower grades in 1920. Richmond and Grafton fielded a combined side in the 5th grade, though Richmond also fielded their own side in the same grade.\nPoint Chevalier fielded their first ever side in the Third Grade competition. They lost their first ever match to Devonport United (North Shore Albions) by 22 points to 6. Their only other reported results were a 21-7 loss to the same opponent in round 7 and a 14-2 loss in round 8 to Manukau.\nSecond Grade.\nThe full results were not reported with just 18 reported and 38 not reported therefor the standings are very incomplete. City Rovers won the competition. Devonport United B withdrew after 7 rounds, Thames Old Boys withdrew after 10 rounds Marist and Māngere Rangers both withdrew after 11 rounds.\nThird Grade.\nManukau won their first ever grade title. The full results were not reported with only 8 scores published in the newspapers and 16 not published. Maritime withdrew after 4 rounds, and Newton Rangers withdrew after 5 rounds. Ellerslie United played a friendly match with Kingsland on September 25 when the season had finished.\nFourth Grade.\nPonsonby United won the competition. There were 19 results reported and 20 not reported. The round 1 match between Kingsland and City was abandoned with the referee refusing to play the match due to the extremely poor standard of the field at the newly developed. Thirty shillings had been spent on clearing the ground prior. Maritime withdrew after just one round while Marist withdrew a week later. Northcote &amp; Birkenhead withdrew following round 8, as did Devonport United. On August 28 Ellerslie (who were reforming) played a match against Grafton-Richmond, which they lost 10-6. On the same day City beat Ponsonby 43-0 in a knockout match. Knockout matches were played over the following 3 weeks but no results were reported.\nFifth Grade.\nManukau won the competition and were undefeated in reported results (20-0, 17-0, 22-8, 9-3, 10-6, and 3-0). There were 17 results reported and 41 not reported. Northcote &amp; Birkenhead withdrew after round 6 rounds, while both Ponsonby sides withdrew after 9 rounds. The round 9 match between Maritime and Grafton-Richmond was the curtain-raiser to the Auckland v England match.\nSixth Grade.\nPonsonby won the championship, sealing it with their 5-0 win over Manukau on August 14. There were only 14 results reported with 18 not reported. The round 10 match between City Rovers and the combined Grafton-Richmond side on July 24 was a curtain-raiser to the Auckland v England match.\nRepresentative fixtures.\nAuckland played a Rest of New Zealand team as part of the selection process for the New Zealand team to play England. They trounced them by 54 points to 0. They later played a trial match between and A and B team before the Auckland side was selected to play England. The match was played at the Auckland Domain in front of 30,000 spectators. Unfortunately the English halfback fractured his tibia in the first few minutes and they were forced to play with 12 for the remainder of the game as the rules at the time did not allow for substitutions of injured players.\nAuckland v Rest of New Zealand.\nThe match was postponed a day due to bad weather and played on the Sunday."

        "title": "Bowling on CBS",
        "text": "Bowling on CBS is the de facto title for CBS Sports' professional ten-pin bowling television coverage.\nHistory.\n\"CBS Bowling Classic\" (1964).\nIn , the Professional Bowlers Association held 31 tournaments worth $1,200,000. Along the way, the PBA put another telecast on the air (after the Winter Tour finals went on the air for the first time on ABC just ), the two-man bestball on CBS. Baseball legend Pee Wee Reese served as the play-by-play announcer while the color analyst was bowling great Billy Welu.\nAs part of the \"CBS Sports Spectacular\" (1979, 1998–99, 2008–09).\nIn , \"CBS Sports Spectacular\" broadcast a ten match tournament during the PBA's Summer schedule. Frank Glieber and Ken Squier served as the play-by-play announcers with Dave Davis working on color commentary.\nAfter ABC televised their final Professional Bowlers Tour event on June 21, , CBS started airing a few events during the and . The new network contract with CBS Sports guaranteed nine one-hour telecasts. It was reported in newspapers that Chris Schenkel did not intend to retire after the series ended, even though he was in his seventies by 1997, as he wanted to earn more money to pay for his grandchildren to go to college.\nWhen CBS picked up the PBA Tour in 1998, there was talk of Schenkel moving to that network, but it never materialized. Gary Seibel (play-by-play) and Marshall Holman (color) got the jobs instead. When the PBA Tour moved to CBS in 1998, a two-match format was adopted. Again going to four bowlers, the #2, #3, and #4 players bowled in one \"shootout\" match, with the winner facing the tournament's #1 qualifier for the championship. From 1998 to 2000, also, the PBA used gold-colored pins with black stripes or crowns (depending on if Brunswick or AMF was involved in the alley) for their televised finals. The pins returned to regular white in 2001.\nIn , Bo Burton served as an analyst alongside Bill Macatee, Michelle Hunter and Lynn Swann for the \"Bowling's Clash of Champions\", a contest that pitted men against women. In this event, a historic first time that a woman ever beat a man in a TV final occurred in the $50,000 title match, when Lynda Barnes, wife of professional bowler Chris Barnes, defeated Sean Rash to take the title.\nCBS would broadcast the \"Bowling's Clash of Champions\" again in .\nCBS Sports Network's coverage (2012–present).\nESPN featured bowling from to 2018 on Sunday afternoons, with CBS Sports Network also airing a smaller number of bowling tournaments by .\nDave Ryan called PBA bowling events on the network alongside color analyst Randy Pedersen from –. The Motel 6 Roll To Riches event marked Ryan's final PBA event. Ryan would be replaced the following season by Rob Stone. Ryan returned to PBA bowling broadcasts in June–July, 2013, when CBS Sports Network covered five events in the PBA Tour's \"Summer Swing.\"\nOther announcers that CBS Sports Network have utilized include Dave LaMont (play-by-play) and Chris Barnes (color commentary). From 2016 to 2018, LaMont was the lead play-by-play broadcaster for PBA Tour events on ESPN. Since the PBA's move to Fox Sports in 2019, LaMont has occasionally filled in for the current lead broadcaster Rob Stone when he is not available. Starting in 2016, Kelly Kulick has provided color commentary for CBS Sports Network broadcasts of the PWBA Tour, except in tournaments where she qualifies for the televised finals.\nIn April 2017, the PBA announced the first-ever Main Event PBA Finals, held May 18–20 in Orlando, Florida and broadcast for five consecutive Tuesdays on CBS Sports Network, starting May 30. This is an invitational event that serves as a type of bowling \"playoffs\", similar to The Chase for the Cup in NASCAR or the FedEx Cup in PGA golf. The event featured the top eight players in PBA Tour earnings, from the start of the 2015 season through this year's USBC Masters. Players were seeded 1–8 based on earnings, and split into Group 1 (1, 4, 5 and 8 seeds) and Group 2 (2, 3, 6 and 7 seeds). The groups bowled a mixed roundrobin match play session of four matches each, which made up the first two broadcasts. Players were then re-seeded within their groups, based on total pinfall plus a 50 pin bonus for every match win. Group 1 and Group 2 stepladder matches were held next, and were broadcast in the third and fourth weeks. The Group 1 and Group 2 winners then faced off in the fifth and final broadcast in a three-game, total pinfall head-to-head match to determine the PBA Finals champion.\nAlso beginning in , CBS Sports Network carried the PBA Tour Finals. The 2019 edition took place July 20 and 21 in Las Vegas. (PBA Commissioner Tom Clark later announced an agreement with CBS Sports Network to cover the PBA Tour finals through the 2022 PBA season.) The tournament retained a similar format as in 2018, with eight top players seeded into two groups of four. The main difference for 2019 is that the eight players were determined based on Tour points ranking since the beginning of the 2018 season. (In previous PBA Tour Finals, the eight bowlers were chosen and seeded based on Tour earnings, not points.) CBS Sports Network broadcast an unprecedented nine hours of live coverage over the two days.\nUSBC Intercollegiate Team Championships (2004–09).\nBack when CBS Sports Network was known as College Sports Television , they showcased the United States Bowling Congress Intercollegiate Team Championships. Beginning in 2004, CSTV aired the women's and men's national championship matches in early June. Chris Lincoln, Brian Webber, and Mike Jakubowski served as the play-by-play announcers with Chris and Lynda Barnes, and Kelly Kulick on color commentary. CBS would air the USBC Intercollegiate Team Championships through 2009, when ESPN took over the rights for the next two years.\nProfessional Women's Bowling Association (2015-present).\nIn , the U.S. Women's open finals (September 6) and PWBA Tour Championship finals (September 13) were broadcast live on CBS Sports Network.\nIn however, CBS Sports Network aired the final round of all standard PWBA Tour events this season on a tape-delay basis. The final round for the major tournaments aired live or on same-day delay. TV tapings of the non-major stepladder finals were conducted in conjunction with first three major tournaments on May 26 (USBC Queens), June 26 (PWBA Players Championship) and August 7 (U.S. Women's Open). This was also the case a as TV tapings of the non-major stepladder finals were conducted in conjunction with first three major tournaments on May 23 (USBC Queens), June 25 (PWBA Players Championship) and August 6 (U.S. Women's Open).\nBeginning in , CBS Sports Network aired the final round of the three Elite Field standard tournaments and all major tournaments live."

        "text": "The 1974–75 Michigan Tech Huskies men's ice hockey team represented Michigan Tech University in college ice hockey. In its 19th year under head coach John MacInnes the team compiled a 32–10–0 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the fourth time in its history. The Huskies defeated Minnesota 6–1 in the championship game at the St. Louis Arena in St. Louis, Missouri, a rematch of the previous season's championship game.\nSeason.\nStreaking.\nAfter coming up just shy in 1973–74 Michigan Tech entered the season with one goal; winning the national championship. Jim Warden, as the only goaltender on the team who wasn't a freshman, was given the opportunity to assume control of the Huskies' crease and played well at the start. With MTU's high-powered offense clicking the Huskies easily won their first four games, outscoring the opposition by a 27–13 margin, winning each contest by at least 3 goals. However, when Tech met their first tough competition they hit a rough patch. Over a three-week span, despite playing four of six contests at home, the Huskies lost five of six games, all against WCHA opponents. Michigan Tech was able to score in most games but their defense surrendered no less than four goals in each match. The losing streak left Tech with a .500 record overall and a 3–5 mark in conference; disastrous numbers for a team hoping to challenge for a national title.\nWarden and the defensive corps led by team captain Bob Lorimer needed to raise their game and the weekend series against three week conference opponents couldn't have come at a better time. A six-game winning streak countered their losing skid and the Huskies were back in contention for home ice in the WCHA Tournament. Just before the winter break Tech headed to Minneapolis to take on the defending national champions and saw their rise up the standings halted with two losses to Minnesota.\nHoliday Season.\nAt the end of December Michigan Tech made their way to Detroit and served as host for the 10th Great Lakes Invitational. The Huskies dominated Yale in the first game then squeezed past Michigan with a 3–2 win to capture their first GLI championship in three years. After two weeks off the Huskies resumed their schedule against the Wolverines and split the home series. The win came in the second match and provided Jim Warden with his first shutout of the season. After spending two weeks walking over bottom-feeders Denver and North Dakota Tech made their first appearance in the new Munn Ice Arena. The Huskies housewarming present was to defeat Michigan State twice and raise their record to 20–8.\nDown the Stretch.\nMichigan Tech held its Winter Carnival at the beginning of February and played host to Minnesota–Duluth. After raising their winning streak to 8 games Tech lost the second contest which left them just two points ahead of Colorado College in the standings. After taking both games at Notre Dame Tech was shutout by Wisconsin before rebounding in the second match.\nWith only one weekend series remaining, Tech found itself tied with CC as both had identical 20–10 conference records. The Tigers were going to take on 9th-place Denver with the Huskies were faced with Minnesota, who had already won the WCHA championship and guaranteed themselves the top seed. The Gophers were flat in their first game, allowing Tech to easily take the contest 7–0 with Warden tying the school record with his third shutout of the season. CC lost their first game against the Pioneers so all Tech needed was a tie to get the second seed. In their second match Minnesota gave the Huskies all they had but Tech was able to pull out a 5–4 victory and give themselves home ice for the duration of the conference tournament.\nPlayoffs.\nNotre Dame arrived in Houghton for the first round of the conference playoffs just two days after the regular season wrapped up. While both teams were presumably tired the Huskies shut the Irish down, winning both games with Jim Warden setting anew program record with his fourth shutout of the season (still a Michigan Tech record as of 2019). The Huskies were able to rest for a day while both the 3rd- and 4th-seeded teams lost, leaving Michigan State as the Huskies opponent. While the Spartans only had a short way to travel from Madison, they were forced to play games on four consecutive nights while the Huskies were able to get a day off in between the two rounds. The tired Spartan defense was no match for Tech who put up 15 goals in the two games and won both to earn their second consecutive WCHA Tournament championship and 7th overall. Even more impressive was the fact that Michigan Tech produced a 30-win season, only the second such occurrence in the history of college hockey (and the first of only two times they've accomplished that feat as of 2019).\nMichigan Tech made their 8th NCAA Tournament appearance as the 2nd western due to Minnesota being the other WCHA winner. As a result, MTU was pitted against ECAC champion Boston University who had the offensive firepower to rival their own. The Terriers opened the scoring in the semifinal and the two teams traded leads in the opening frame before heading to the locker room tied 2-all. When the second period began the Huskies charged out of the gate and scored three times in under six minutes. BU was able to get one goal to close the gap but Bob D'Alvise' second goal of the game restored the 3-goal lead. with just under two minutes to play in the period Mike Fidler was called for a major high-sticking penalty, giving MTU a 5-minutes man-advantage. Bill Steele scored just 21 seconds into the power play while George Lyle and Mike Zuke added their own markers early in the third period. With the score 9–3 as a result the game was essentially over and though the Terriers netted two more before time expired the Huskies had proved themselves the better breed.\nNational championship.\nThe championship game became a rematch of the previous year's finale with Tech looking for revenge against Minnesota. Interestingly enough, both Minnesota and Michigan Tech had entered the NCAA tournament as the first teams in 14 years to record 30 wins and with each having won their semifinal meetings both shared the record for the most wins in a season. That record, however, was secondary to the game itself. The two teams played before a crowd of nearly 7,000 people, far below the maximum capacity of the St. Louis Arena but much more than they were used to seeing. Michigan Tech scored first, just past the halfway mark of the opening frame and added a second from Zuke with 64 seconds remaining. Tech's defense held the Gophers to only 7 shots in the period and continued their stifling play throughout the game. The Huskies themselves were held to only 5 shots on goal in the second but they made them count, doubling their lead to 4–0 after forty minutes. The final period saw more of the same with the Huskies tying their own championship record with six consecutive goals from the start of the game. Minnesota's Tom Younghans finally got the puck past Jim Warden midway through the final period but by then it was too late and Michigan Tech won their third national championship as well as set a new NCAA record with 32 wins on the year.\nWith his almost shutout of the Gophers, Jim Warden was named as the tournament MOP and was joined on the All-Tournament Team by Bob Lorimer, Bob D'Alvise and Steve Jensen. D'Alvise finished third in the nation in scoring and was named to the AHCA All-American West Team. He also made an appearance on the All-WCHA First Team with Warden while Lorimer and Mike Zuke made the WCHA Second Team.\nThe following year Warden would be the starting goaltender for the US national team at the Winter Olympics, joined by fellow Michigan Tech alums Steve Jensen and Paul Jensen.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": " (), also called the Naisten SM-liiga (NSML) and Jääkiekon naisten SM-liiga (), is the elite league for women's ice hockey in Finland. Founded by the Finnish Ice Hockey Association as the Naisten SM-sarja () in 1982, it was so known until being rebranded as the Naisten Liiga in 2017. The league comprises approximately 250 players across ten teams.\nKiekko-Espoo (previously known as Espoo Blues, Espoo United, and EKS) has been the dominating force of the Naisten Liiga in the 21st century, winning sixteen Finnish Championships from 1999 to 2022. Tampereen Ilves is the second most successful club in league history, with ten championship titles, and are the only organization to have iced a team in every season since the league's inception.\nA majority of teams in Naisten Liiga share their names with men's professional teams in the Liiga or Mestis – HIFK, HPK, Ilves, KalPa, Kiekko-Espoo, Kärpät, Lukko, RoKi, TPS – but the women's teams have historically received few resources and limited promotion from the affiliated men's clubs. In recent years progress has been made in building better relationships between the men's and women's teams; most men's clubs now provide some support to their women's counterparts by advertising games together or helping secure sponsorships.\nFormat.\nSeason format.\nThe Finnish Ice Hockey Association has altered the season format of the Naisten Liiga several times over the league's history. The system currently in use was introduced for the 2022–23 season. It added six games per team to the regular season schedule and matched the season structure of the league's closest neighbor, the Swedish Women's Hockey League (SDHL). The new format replaced the previous twenty-game preliminary series and ten-game divisional series structure, which was first introduced in the 2018–19 season and refined prior to the 2019–20 season.\nThe regular season is a quadruple round-robin tournament, with each team playing every other team four times – typically, each team plays every other team twice at home and twice away – resulting in a 36-game season per team. Teams are ranked by points, with three points awarded for a win in regulation time, two points for an overtime win, one point for an overtime loss, and no points awarded for a regulation loss. Individual player statistics from the regular season determine the winner of the Marianne Ihalainen Award, for most points, and the Tiia Reima Award, for most goals scored.\nThe top eight teams at the end of the regular season qualify for the Naisten Liiga playoffs.\nThe three rounds of the Naisten Liiga playoffs () are played as a best-of-five tournament, with the exception of the single-elimination game for the Finnish Championship bronze medal. In the quarterfinals, the initial round, teams are paired by seeding from the regular season, with the first seed facing the eighth seed, the second seed facing the seventh seed, and so on.\nThe champions of the Naisten Liiga playoffs receive the Aurora Borealis Cup as league champions and gold medals as Finnish Champions in women's ice hockey. Selected by the Finnish Ice Hockey Association, the MVP of the playoffs is awarded the Karoliina Rantamäki Trophy.\nThe teams finishing the season ranked ninth and tenth play a promotion/relegation series () against the top two teams of the Naisten Mestis regular season. The two teams that finish the series with the most points qualify for the following Naisten Liiga season and the two lower ranked teams are relegated to or remain in the Naisten Mestis for the following season.\nGame format.\nA regulation game is sixty minutes in length, played over three 20-minute periods. In the event of a tie at the end of regulation time the winner is decided by a five-minute-length, three-skaters-per-side overtime period. If the game remains tied after the overtime period, the teams proceed to a shootout, in which each team designates three skaters to take penalty shots, one at a time, against the opposing goaltender. Teams alternate shots and each team takes one shot per round. The winner is the team with more goals after three rounds or the team that amasses an unreachable advantage before the third round. If the shootout is tied after three rounds, tie-breaker rounds are played one at a time until there is a winner.\nTeams.\nPast participants.\n2000s.\nSources:\nChampions.\nAll-time medal count.\n – team participated in 2023–24 season\nNotes:\nSources:&lt;ref name=\"biller_97/98–22/23\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nFinnish Champions by season.\nNotes:\nSources:\nLeague records.\nAll-time records of the Naisten Liiga, from the 1982–83 season through the conclusion of the 2023–24 season.\nSingle-season records.\n\"Players appearing in ten or fewer games during a single season are not included.\"\n\"Players appearing in three or fewer games during a single playoff are not included.\"&lt;ref name=\"ep-stats_single-season/playoff\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nCareer records.\n\"Players appearing in fewer than thirty regular season games during their Naisten Liiga career are not included.\"\n\"Players appearing in ten or fewer Naisten Liiga playoff games during their career are not included.\"&lt;ref name=\"ep-stats_career/playoff\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nAll-time scoring leaders.\nThe top-ten regular season point-scorers in Naisten SM-sarja/Naisten Liiga history, through the conclusion of 2023–24 season."

From 1937–38 to 1939–40, and again from 1944–45 to 1948–49, the championship series pitted the winners from the Eastern Division against the winners from the Western Division. However, due to fewer teams in the league caused by World War II, the NBL was not separated into divisions between 1940–41 and 1943–44, therefore the playoffs included the top four teams in the single-division league. Home court advantage was determined by better overall record heading into the championship series.\nThree teams are tied with the most NBL championships at two each – the Akron Firestone Non-Skids (1939, 1940), Oshkosh All-Stars (1941, 1942), and Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons (1944, 1945). The Oshkosh All-Stars have the most championship appearances of any team with six, followed by the Sheboygan Red Skins' five appearances."

        "title": "A Shakespearean Baseball Game",
        "text": "\"A Shakespearean Baseball Game\", subtitled \"A Comedy of Errors, Hits and Runs\", is a sketch by the Canadian comedy duo Wayne and Shuster. First performed on television in 1958 and slightly revised in 1971 and 1977, the sketch depicts a fictional baseball game with the manager, players, and umpires all speaking in Shakespearean verse. The dialogue parodies lines from the plays \"Hamlet\", \"Macbeth\", \"Julius Caesar\", and \"Richard III\" while referencing modern baseball culture. It became Wayne and Shuster's signature sketch, and both its television and radio recordings have been preserved as significant works.\nHistory.\n\"A Shakespearean Baseball Game\" was created to poke fun at the hoopla surrounding the Stratford Festival, a Shakespearean festival founded in Stratford, Ontario, Canada, in 1953. Like other works by Wayne and Shuster, the sketch assumes knowledge of the classics, in this case the plays \"Hamlet\", \"Macbeth\", \"Julius Caesar\", and \"Richard III\". In preparation for the sketch, the comedians read most of Shakespeare's plays and went to the Stratford Festival, the American Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford, Connecticut, and the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon, England. Wayne crafted the iambic pentameter for the sketch. Modal Elizabethan music was composed for the sketch by the comedy duo's arranger, Johnny Dobson.\nThe sketch was first performed on television on May 22, 1958, closing \"The Wayne &amp; Shuster Hour\"s 1957–58 season with CBC Television. It was then performed on US television on June 1, on their third appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", which they emceed while Sullivan was in Europe.\nThe duo had been scheduled to perform game-show parody \"The $64,000 Squeal\", and had a heated argument over switching to \"Shakespearean Baseball\". Wayne was concerned that the new sketch wasn't yet ready for the US, while Shuster felt it was worth the risk to make a bigger impact and help attract additional job offers as their CBC contract had expired. The show was seen by an estimated 40 million viewers in the US and Canada.\nThe sketch was performed for CBC Radio on June 18, 1959. This recording was among the Wayne and Shuster works restored and preserved in 2000 by the Masterworks program of National Archives Canada.\nThe sketch was included on the duo's first comedy album, \"Wayne and Shuster: In Person Comedy Performance\", in 1960. In 1971, the comedians slightly revised the script and re-broadcast the sketch on colour television. In 1977, the comedians produced a third version in honour of the formation of the Toronto Blue Jays.\nDescription.\nThe setting for the sketch is \"Bosworth Field (A Baseball Stadium Near Stratford)\", an allusion to the site of the final battle in \"Richard III\". That play was the first to be staged by the Stratford Festival in its 1953 debut season. The sketch incorporates 33 quotations and puns from Shakespearean plays, along with visual slapstick. Characters speak their lines in blank verse, with the poetic metering of iambic pentameter. \nThe sketch runs for 10 to 11 minutes. The main roles are the team's manager and catcher, in parodies of Horatio and Hamlet, with 11 supporting roles.\nShuster plays the manager of the fictional Stratford team, while Wayne plays the team's catcher, a slugger who has not had a hit in ten games. The catcher mopes in the locker room and soliloquizes in the manner of Hamlet, \"Oh, what a rogue and bush league slob am I, who has ten days hitless gone.\" With the Stratford team down 1–0 in the bottom of the ninth inning with two outs, the catcher is next at bat. Unlike \"Casey at the Bat\", to which it has been compared, \"A Shakespearean Baseball Game\" ends with the would-be hero being hit by a pitch in the head, becoming delirious, and ultimately being carried off the field. His manager vows, \"No longer would Stratford see Yogi play ball, I'm trading the bum to Montreal\".\nIn the 1977 version, the manager was named \"The Mighty Thurman\", the starting pitcher was called \"Catfish\", and the relief pitcher was dubbed \"Sparky\", incorporating names of baseball stars of that era.\nReception.\nThe sketch was well received on its 1958 premieres on Canadian and US television. Arthur Brydon of \"The Globe and Mail\" called it \"some of the cleverest Wayne and Shuster comedy of the season\", and that it was suitable for \"Sullivan\".\nWilliam Drylie of the \"Toronto Daily Star\" wrote that the sketch was \"one riot followed by another\" in one of their strongest shows, and agreed that it was ready for \"Sullivan\".\nFollowing the sketch's US debut on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", \"Variety\" reported that the duo were \"the freshest comedy team extant\" and suggested that Sullivan's show be renamed after them.\nThere was considerable speculation that Wayne and Shuster might have permanently moved to New York, as their CBC contract had expired and their hosting \"Sullivan\" was a great success. On June 13, 1958, they signed a new contract with CBC which made them the highest-paid performers in Canadian television.\nRetrospectives.\n\"A Shakespearean Baseball Game\" is considered Wayne and Shuster's signature sketch. In a CBC interview, the duo noted the sketch's initial performances as the height of their career. The sketch is included in \"The Wayne &amp; Shuster Years\", a 75-minute retrospective of their 50+ year career, broadcast on CBC Television on February 24, 1991, and released on home video on May 28, 1996. Hosting the special, Shuster introduces the sketch as \"our personal best\".\nThe original television recording was included in \"Wayne and Shuster in Black and White\", a retrospective series of 22 half-hour episodes, edited from the CBC archives by Shuster and broadcast on CBC Television in 1996. \"The Toronto Star\" rated that series 5 out of 5 and called the sketch a \"grand takeoff\" and \"wonderful moments to savor\".\nIn 2002, John McKay of The Canadian Press wrote that the sketch remains \"deceptively sophisticated\".\nLegacy.\nFor decades, English teachers requested copies of the sketch for their classes.\nIn the form of a short play, the sketch has been staged theatrically at the Louisville Slugger Museum &amp; Factory as part of the Kentucky Shakespeare Festival, the Toronto Jewish Film Festival,\nand at numerous other theatre festivals and events.\nAccording to the Canadian Adaptations of Shakespeare Project at the University of Guelph, the sketch influenced later sports comedy parodies of Shakespeare by Chris Coculuzzi and Matt Toner in \"Shakespeare's Rugby Wars\" (2001) and \"Shakespeare's World Cup\" (2002)."

We’re all feeling for Billy, there was a big opportunity there for him but the type of person he is he’ll fight back from this\".

        "text": "Seth William Brown (born July 13, 1992) is an American professional baseball outfielder and first baseman for the Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball (MLB). He made his MLB debut in 2019.\nEarly life and amateur career.\nBrown was born in and grew up in Klamath Falls, Oregon, and initially attended Klamath Union High School. His family moved to Medford, Oregon, going into his senior year in order to shorten his mother's commute to work. Following the move, Brown attended North Medford High School and was named first team All-Southwest Conference and second team OSAA Class 6A All-State as a senior. Both at North Medford and for the Medford Mustangs in American Legion, Brown was a teammate of Major League pitcher Braden Shipley.\nBrown began his college career at Linn–Benton Community College, playing for two seasons and was named first team All- Southern Region by the Northwest Athletic Association of Community Colleges as a sophomore. He transferred to Lewis–Clark State College after his sophomore year at the recommendation of LBCC's head coach, Greg Hawk. He was forced to redshirt his junior season due academic issues. In his only season playing for the Warriors, Brown was named a second team National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) All-American after posting a .386 average in while leading the NAIA with 23 home runs and driving in 82 RBIs (2nd in the NAIA) and scoring 78 runs (3rd) as the Warriors went on to win the 2015 NAIA World Series.\nProfessional career.\nThe Oakland Athletics selected Brown in the 19th round, with the 578th overall selection, of the 2015 MLB Draft. After signing with the team, he was assigned to the Rookie League Arizona League Athletics before being promoted to the Vermont Lake Monsters of the Class A Short Season New York–Penn League after six games. He batted .289 with 19 doubles, three home runs, 35 RBIs and 32 runs scored and was selected to play in the New York–Penn League All-Star Game and was named the Lake Monsters' team MVP. He skipped Class A and began the 2016 season with the Class A-Advanced Stockton Ports, where he hit .241 with eight home runs and 53 RBIs. He was reassigned to the Ports again the next season and increased his offensive production dramatically. Brown was named a California League All-Star and the Player of the Month for August by Minor League Baseball and finished the season with a .270 average while leading the California League with 30 home runs and 109 RBIs. Brown spent the 2018 season with the AA Midland RockHounds, where he batted .283 with 14 home runs and 90 RBIs. He began the 2019 season with the AAA Las Vegas Aviators and was batting .297 with 37 home runs, second in the Pacific Coast League, at the time of his promotion to the Major Leagues.\nThe Athletics selected Brown's contract on August 26, 2019. He made his debut that night against the Kansas City Royals and recorded his first career hit, a single off Jorge López, in his first career at bat went 2-for-6 overall with an RBI and two runs scored in the A's 19-4 win. Brown batted .293 with eight doubles, two triples, 13 RBIs and 11 runs scored in 26 games played (75 at bats) in his first Major League season. In 2020, Brown only appeared in 7 games, going hitless in five plate appearances for the club. He had his proper rookie season in 2021, when he hit .214/.274/.480 with 20 home runs and 48 RBIs in 111 games.\nOn June 11, 2022, Brown hit a go-ahead grand slam off of Eli Morgan of the Cleveland Guardians to help lead the Athletics to a 10-5 victory. In 2022 he batted .229/.295/.436/. 39.2% of the pitches to him were fastballs, the lowest percentage of those to any major leaguer.\nIn January 2024, Brown avoided arbitration by signing a one-year, $2.6 million contract with Oakland. This was the second highest contract on the team for a position player.\nPersonal life.\nBrown is one of seven siblings. His younger brother, Micah, also played baseball at Lewis–Clark and was a drafted by the Miami Marlins in the 2017 MLB Draft. Brown married Brittaney Niebergall, a former Lewis–Clark basketball player who was named the NAIA Freshman Player of the Year and is currently a middle school teacher and basketball coach.\nBrown graduated from Lewis–Clark with a degree in criminal justice and has worked for the Idaho Department of Fish and Game during his offseasons."

Held on 3 May 2019 at the Khalifa International Stadium, it was the first leg of the 2019 IAAF Diamond League – the highest level international track and field circuit.\nA total of eight world-leading performances were set at the competition, three of which were also meeting records. Daniel Ståhl of Sweden gave the highlight of the meeting with six straight discus throws beyond 69.50 m (the first man ever to deliver such as series) including a Diamond League record of 70.56 m. Caster Semenya of South Africa won the women's 800 metres in a meet record of 1:54.98 minutes and American Dalilah Muhammad improved the previous women's 400 metres hurdles record with her time of 53.61 seconds. The other world leaders on the men's side came from Nijel Amos of Botswana (1:44.29 in the 800 m), Kenyan Elijah Manangoi (3:32.21 in the 1500 metres) and Soufiane El Bakkali of Morocco (8:07.22 in the 3000 metres steeplechase). Great Britain's Dina Asher-Smith ran a world leading time of 22.26 to win the women's 200 metres and Kenya's Hellen Obiri overcame Genzebe Dibaba to win the women's 3000 metres in 8:25.60 minutes. The latter was among the highlights of the meet in terms of strength in depth, as it saw eight athletes achieve lifetime bests. The men's shot put also produced high quality performances, with winner Ryan Crouser and runner-up Tom Walsh both going beyond twenty-two metres.\nDiamond League Results.\nAthletes competing in the Diamond League disciplines earned extra compensation and points which went towards qualifying for one of two Diamond League finals (either Zürich or Brussels depending on the discipline). First place earned 8 points, with each step down in place earning one less point than the previous, until no points are awarded in 9th place or lower."

        "text": "The 2017 World Women's Snooker Championship was a women's snooker tournament that took place at the Lagoon Billiard Room in Toa Payoh, Singapore, from 13 to 19 March 2017. The event was the 2017 edition of the World Women's Snooker Championship first held in 1976. The event was won by Hong Kong's Ng On-yee, who defeated Vidya Pillai in the final 6–5. Playing time in the final was 8 hours and 4 minutes, making it the longest recorded best-of-11- match, surpassing the previous record of 7 hours and 14 minutes set at the 1992 UK Championship.\nThe event featured a total prize fund of £15,000, with the winner receiving £5,000. On-yee scored the highest break of the tournament, a 76. The competition was sponsored by Eden Resources.\nBackground.\nThe tournament was held at the Lagoon Billiard Room in Toa Payoh, Singapore, the first time in more than 20 years that the women's championship had been held outside the United Kingdom. Entry was on an invitational basis, with 32 players, from ten different countries competing. The competition was sponsored by Eden Resources.\nThe event featured eight groups of four players, with the top two players from each group progressing. The event was split after the group stage, with players not reaching the main knockout tournament competing in a parallel tournament named the \"Challenge Cup\". Matches were played as best-of-five frames in the group stage, increasing in each round up to the final which was played as a best-of-11-frames match.\nSeeding.\nThere were eight seeded players for the tournament, determined by rankings following the 2017 Connie Gough Tournament held in February 2017, who were drawn into separate groups. The seeded players were:\nTournament summary.\nEarly stages.\nThe event began on 13 March with the group stages, featuring eight groups of four players, the top two players progressing from each group. Group stage matches were all played as best-of-five- matches, with dead frames being played. Reanne Evans won all 15 frames across her three matches, whilst both Katrina Wan and Rebecca Kenna won 14 frames each, losing just one.\nIn the semi-finals, Ng On-yee came back from 60 points down in the deciding frame to beat defending champion Reanne Evans 5–4. Vidya Pillai defeated Rebecca Kenna 5–1 to become the first championship finalist ever from India.\nOn her way to the final, Pillai defeated four of the eight seeded players – Maria Catalano in the group stage, then Tatjana Vasiljeva, Katrina Wan, and Kenna in the knockouts. On-yee against Pillai was the first all-Asian final in the history of the championship.\nThe semi-finals started at 10:00 am local time on Sunday, 19 March, with the final scheduled for the afternoon. On-yee had a break of only 30 minutes after her semi-final win before starting what turned out to be a lengthy final commencing at 16:00 pm.\nFinal.\nThe final was played on 19 March 2019, as a best-of-11-frames match. On-yee won the first two frames before losing the next four. She then won the next three to lead 5–4, before Pillai won the tenth to take the match to the deciding frame.\nThe deciding frame lasted over an hour. With just pink and black balls left, and the pink lying close to the black, which was itself very close to one of the corner , On-yee fouled and left a free ball. Pillai, four points behind, the black but and hit the pink instead, also the black. On-yee then potted the pink ball to take the frame 66–50 and gain her second world title, having also won in 2015.\nThe playing time in the final was 8 hours and 4 minutes; it was the longest 11-frame competitive match in snooker, significantly exceeding the previous record of 7 hours and 14 minutes taken by Paul Tanner to defeat Robby Foldvari 6–5 at the 1992 UK Championship. It was the first final to go to the deciding frame in the tournament since 1989, finishing at 1:30 am local time.\nAcross the semi-final and final, On-yee played for more than 12 hours on the Sunday (and the early part of Monday morning). She received £5,000 for her win. The winner's prize money the previous year, when Reanne Evans won, had been less than a quarter of this.\nBreaks.\nThe highest break of the tournament was 76 by On-yee. The second-highest break was scored by On-yee and Evans, who both had a 69. In all, there were only eleven breaks of 50 or over during the groups and knockout stage.\nTournament results.\nGroup stage.\nThe top two players from each of the groups progressed into the knockout draw, where they were seeded based on group stage results. Progression from the group stages was determined, in order, by: Matches won; Head to head results; Frames won; Highest break; and Ranking position.\nKnockout.\nSource: WPBSA Tournament Manager.\nPlayers listed in bold indicate match winner. \nChallenge cup.\nThe challenge cup was a competition for players who did not reach the main knockout draw. It was won by Amee Kamani. The highest break was 90 by Nutcharut Wongharuthai in her match against Neelam Mittal. Players listed in bold indicate match winners."

It featured the bottom four teams from the 2019–2022 ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League along with an additional four sides who did not participate in the 2019–2022 ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League and met the requirements. The eight teams were placed into two groups of four, with the top three teams from each group to advance to the Super Six stage. The best four sides emerging from the Challenge League Play-off competition qualified for the twelve-team World Cup Challenge League field for the next cycle.\nKuwait and Tanzania were the first teams to secure a place in the Challenge League. Bahrain also claimed a place, meaning that three new teams would be promoted into the Challenge League. The last slot was taken by Italy, who retained their place in the Challenge League by winning a low-scoring thriller against Vanuatu by 2 wickets, in what was essentially a relegation play-off. Kuwait emerged as winners at the end of the tournament.\nTeams and qualification.\nIn the Challenge League Play-off, the bottom two teams from each of the two groups in the 2019–2022 Challenge League joined four others from outside the 32-team qualification process. These were the four nations with the highest Twenty20 International ranking meeting the following entry requirements:\n[i] They must had a minimum of eight domestic teams playing regular cricket, including at least five 40+-over matches in each of the two previous years; \n[ii] They had to be in the top 40 of the ICC T20I Championship rankings as of 30 September 2023.\nBahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Tanzania qualified for the tournament after meeting the requirements."

The Super League replaced the ODI rankings as the route to direct qualification for the 2023 Cricket World Cup. The only edition of the ODI Super League was between 2020–2023.\nBackground.\nThe Super League was introduced after the 2019 Cricket World Cup and introduced improvements to the World Cup qualification process. The previous use of ODI rankings involved intricate calculations and was unbalanced. It was open to manipulation with no obligation for top teams to play against lesser teams, who were left with no chance to improve their positions. In comparison, the Super League has a simple points table and the same number of matches for each team.\nFacing better competition provided lesser teams with the prospect of better attendance, financial gain and increased popularity of cricket in their countries. The Netherlands were scheduled to host England in May 2021 but the series was pushed back a year as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could have restricted attendance and made the series financially unviable.\nCompetition.\nThe Super League formed part of the qualification process for the 2023 Cricket World Cup. This was the only time that this format has been used and it will not be used for 2027. 13 teams each played 24 matches and were ranked by their results. The fixtures were agreed by consensus between the teams. The top ranked teams directly qualified for the World Cup while the remaining teams advanced to the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier."

        "title": "West Indian cricket team in England in 2020",
        "text": "The West Indies cricket team toured England to play three Test matches. The team were originally scheduled to tour the country in May and June 2020. However, the series was initially postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cricket West Indies stated that they would do everything they can to help accommodate the fixtures, including moving the fixtures back or even hosting them in the West Indies. A revised tour schedule, with the first Test starting in July, was proposed at the end of May 2020. The fixtures were confirmed the following month, with the matches all played behind closed doors. The Test series formed part of the inaugural 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship.\nThe series was played for the Wisden Trophy. Ahead of the third Test, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and Cricket West Indies (CWI) agreed to retire the trophy following the conclusion of the series. It was replaced with the Richards–Botham Trophy, in honour of Sir Viv Richards and Sir Ian Botham.\nOn the morning of the fifth and final day of the third Test, England's Stuart Broad became the seventh bowler to take 500 wickets in Test cricket, after dismissing Kraigg Brathwaite. Broad was the fourth fast bowler, and second bowler for England after James Anderson, to reach the milestone. England lost the first Test of the series, but won the remaining two matches, to win the series 2–1, and regain the Wisden Trophy. It was the first time since 1888 that England had won a three-match Test series at home after losing the opening match.\nBackground.\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced that no professional matches would take place before 28 May 2020 due to the pandemic. In April 2020, Ashley Giles, the director of cricket, said that hosting the Test matches in June was looking \"less and less likely\", but that \"everything is on the table\" with regards to England's schedule in 2020. On 24 April 2020, the ECB confirmed that no professional cricket would be played in England before 1 July 2020, with the tour being postponed. After the tour was postponed, both cricket boards had been involved in \"positive\" talks about rescheduling the series. This included the possibility of the West Indies team going into isolation for 14 days, and the first Test match starting on 8 July 2020. The ECB were also looking at hosting the Test matches in bio-secure environments, with Old Trafford in Manchester and the Rose Bowl in Southampton being possible venues, due to their hotel facilities.\nOn 13 May 2020, Johnny Grave, the chief executive of Cricket West Indies, said that he was hopeful that the tour would go ahead, but that players would be \"very nervous\" about travelling. The next day, the ECB confirmed that England players would return to training in the following week. Grave also confirmed that thirty players had been identified for preparation for the tour, with the West Indies' Test captain Jason Holder saying that no-one would be forced to travel, with safety being the priority. In late May 2020, a revised schedule was issued, with the final Test match taking place at Old Trafford in late July 2020. Grave also revealed details of a tentative tour itinerary, with the first Test starting on 8 July 2020 at the Rose Bowl in Southampton. The same week, the UK government published updated guidance on the resumption of training for elite sports. The West Indies also resumed training, with small groups taking part in on-field sessions at the Kensington Oval in Barbados. Cricket West Indies gave its approval \"in principle\" of touring England. On 2 June 2020, the ECB confirmed the dates and venues for the three-match series.\nOn 29 May 2020, the ECB named a 55-man group of players to begin training ahead of international fixtures starting in England. On 17 June 2020, this was trimmed down to a 30-man squad to prepare behind closed doors for the Test matches. England and the West Indies played intra-squad warm-up matches in Southampton and Manchester respectively prior to the Test series. On 3 June 2020, Cricket West Indies named a 14-man squad, along with eleven reserve players for the Test series. Darren Bravo, Shimron Hetmyer and Keemo Paul decided against travelling to England, due to coronavirus fears, and the length of time they could be away from their families. On 8 June 2020, the squad flew out from Antigua, arriving at Manchester Airport the following morning. After arrival, Jason Holder said that the players feel safe and that people \"were crying out for cricket\".\nIn June 2020, the International Cricket Council (ICC) made several interim changes to the Playing Conditions due to the pandemic. A substitute could be used for any player showing symptoms of COVID-19, but only in a Test match. Players were banned from using saliva to shine the ball, with five penalty runs being awarded to the opposition for repeated transgressions. The requirement to use neutral match officials was temporarily lifted, along with an increase to the number of DRS reviews a team can use, due to having less experienced umpires in a match. Michael Gough, Richard Illingworth and Richard Kettleborough were named as the on-field umpires for the Test matches, with Alex Wharf named as the fourth umpire. The last English umpire to stand in a home Test match was Peter Willey in the fifth Ashes Test in August 2001. The last time two English umpires stood in the same Test match in England was for the sixth Ashes Test in August 1993, when Mervyn Kitchen and Barrie Meyer were the on-field umpires.\nSquads.\nCricket West Indies also named Sunil Ambris, Joshua Da Silva, Shannon Gabriel, Keon Harding, Kyle Mayers, Preston McSween, Marquino Mindley, Shayne Moseley, Anderson Phillip, Oshane Thomas and Jomel Warrican as reserve players for the Test series. Following the conclusion of their practice matches, Shannon Gabriel was added to the West Indies' Test squad.\nEngland captain Joe Root missed the first Test match to be at the birth of his second child, with Ben Stokes captaining England in his absence. Prior to being named captain, Stokes had never led a side in a first-class, List A or Twenty20 cricket match. On 4 July 2020, England named a thirteen-man squad for the first Test with James Bracey, Sam Curran, Ben Foakes, Dan Lawrence, Jack Leach, Saqib Mahmood, Craig Overton, Ollie Robinson and Olly Stone also named as reserve players. Some of the cricketers not selected for the Test matches from the initial 30-man squad began preparing for the One Day International (ODI) matches against Ireland.\nJoe Root returned to the squad for the second Test, with James Anderson and Mark Wood both being rested. Sam Curran and Ollie Robinson were named in England's squad for the second Test, with Robinson getting his maiden call-up to the senior team. On the morning of the second Test, Jofra Archer was dropped from England's squad for the fixture, after he breached biosecurity protocols. As a result, he was placed in isolation for five days, fined, and given a written warning by the ECB.\nPractice matches.\nThe West Indies were due to play three tour matches, one each against England Lions, Worcestershire, and Northamptonshire. However, the tour matches were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, the 25-man touring squad played two intra-squad matches, serving as preparation. The squad was split into two teams, with one team being captained by Kraigg Brathwaite and the other being captained by Jason Holder. The teams were named after their respective captains. Initially, the second match was to have first-class status. However, the plan for this was changed after no play was possible on the first day of the fixture, allowing the West Indies to utilise all 25 players in their squad.\nEngland also played an intra-squad match as warm-up, which started on 1 July 2020 at the Rose Bowl. England's squad was also split into two teams, with Ben Stokes captaining one side, and Jos Buttler captaining the other."

        "text": "The Australia cricket team toured England to play three One Day International (ODI) and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches in September 2020. The ODI matches formed part of the inaugural 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League. Originally, the matches were scheduled to take place in July 2020, but were moved back to September 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 14 August 2020, Cricket Australia named a touring squad of 21 players, after gaining government exemptions to travel to the United Kingdom. The T20Is were played at the Rose Bowl in Southampton, the ODIs were played at Old Trafford in Manchester, with all the fixtures played behind closed doors.\nEngland won the first two T20I matches, winning the series with an unassailable lead. For the third T20I fixture, Moeen Ali captained England for the first time in an international match, after Eoin Morgan suffered a hand injury in the second T20I. Australia went on to win the match by five wickets, with England winning the series 2–1. With their win in the third T20I, Australia finished at the top of the ICC T20I Championship rankings. Australia won the ODI series 2–1. It was the first time in five years that England had lost an ODI series at home, after Australia beat them 3–2 in September 2015.\nBackground.\nIn May 2020, it was suggested that the dates for the series were moved back to September, to accommodate the rescheduling of the ODI fixtures against Ireland due to the pandemic. Later the same month, Kevin Roberts, the then CEO of Cricket Australia, said that there was still a chance that the series would take place. On 17 June 2020, Cricket Scotland confirmed that their one-off T20I match against Australia had been cancelled. At the time of the cancellation, new dates for Australia's matches against England were in discussion, with both cricket boards working out a revised schedule for September 2020. On 6 July 2020, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed discussions were still ongoing to host the series. On 16 July 2020, Cricket Australia named a 26-man preliminary squad to begin training ahead of the planned tour to England. On 14 August 2020, Cricket Australia named a squad of 21 players to tour England, with the team departing from Perth on 23 August 2020.\nSquads.\nAustralia did not name individual squads for the ODI and T20I matches, opting instead to name a combined squad of 21 players for the tour.\nJoe Denly and Saqib Mahmood were named as reserve players for England's ODI squad, with Liam Livingstone and Saqib Mahmood named as reserve players for the T20I squad. On 6 September 2020, Phil Salt was added to England's list of reserve players for the ODI matches. Jos Buttler ruled himself out of England's squad for the third T20I match due to personal reasons. On 9 September 2020, Jason Roy was added to England's ODI squad, with Dawid Malan named as a reserve player for the matches.\nPractice matches.\nPrior to the international matches, Australia trained at the County Cricket Ground in Derby. The team then travelled to Southampton to play intra-squad practice matches at the Rose Bowl. Aaron Finch and Pat Cummins were named as the captains of the two teams, with a cricketer from Hampshire County Cricket Club also included to make the full complement of 22 players. The first warm-up match was scheduled to be 50 overs per side, but was reduced to a 20-over game, after rain was forecast for later in the day. The rain did end the first match early, after 5.5 overs were bowled in the second innings. Conversely, the next practice match was scheduled to be played as a 20-over match, but was changed to a 50-over game. Finally, Australia's squad played two 20-over matches on 1 September 2020, with Aaron Finch's team winning both matches."

        "text": "The Pakistan cricket team toured England in August and September 2020 to play three Tests and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. The Test series formed part of the inaugural 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship. The first Test and the T20I matches were played at Old Trafford, and the second and third Test matches were played at the Rose Bowl. All of the fixtures were played behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn 5 August 2020, the International Cricket Council (ICC) announced the use of technology to monitor front-foot no-balls for the first time in Test cricket. The third umpire called the front-foot no-balls and communicated this with the on-field umpires. This followed a successful trial in the One Day International (ODI) matches between England and Ireland in the World Cup Super League, which concluded the day before the Test series.\nOn the final day of the third Test, England's James Anderson became the first fast bowler to take 600 Test wickets. England won the three-match Test series 1–0, after the second and third Tests were drawn. The T20I series was drawn 1–1, with the first match being washed out.\nBackground.\nAhead of the tour to England, Pakistan were scheduled to play three One Day International (ODI) matches in the Netherlands, and two T20I matches in Ireland; however, in April 2020, the matches in the Netherlands were postponed after the Dutch government banned all events in the country, both sports and cultural, until 1 September 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the pandemic, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) investigated the possibility of hosting the Test matches in bio-secure environments; Old Trafford in Manchester and the Rose Bowl in Southampton were mooted as possible venues due to their hotel facilities. In May 2020, Wasim Khan, the chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), was in talks with the ECB about the possibility of touring England; the PCB said they were \"very optimistic\" with regard to the plans. The PCB planned to send a combined Test and T20I squad of 25 players to give them the best options in case of any injuries. In the same month, Babar Azam was named as the new captain of Pakistan's One Day International (ODI) team. Babar said that he had complete faith and trust in the PCB's decision on touring, and said if it were safe to go, he would definitely join the tour.\nIn late May 2020, a revised schedule was issued, starting with the first Test match at Old Trafford from 5 August 2020. The choice of Old Trafford for the first Test meant it was the first time since England toured South Africa in 1905–06 that the team had played three Tests in a row at the same ground. On 9 June 2020, the PCB appointed Younis Khan and Mushtaq Ahmed respectively as their batting and spin bowling coaches for the tour. The PCB also decided not to hold a training camp for the national team in Lahore, and the board worked with the ECB to bring their travel date forward by a week. On 11 June 2020, the PCB confirmed that Mohammad Amir and Haris Sohail were not available to tour England due to personal reasons. On 12 June 2020, the PCB named a 29-man squad for the tour; the Test side would be captained by Azhar Ali and the T20I side by Babar Azam. After the squad was named, Wahab Riaz said that he would be willing to play Test cricket again, after taking a break from first-class cricket in September 2019.\nThe PCB announced that the touring party would go through three rounds of COVID-19 testing prior to leaving Pakistan, and would be tested every five days once in England. On 22 June 2020, the PCB confirmed that Haider Ali, Shadab Khan and Haris Rauf had all tested positive for the virus. None of the three players had shown any previous symptoms, and were all advised to go into a period of self-isolation. England's director of cricket, Ashley Giles, said he was \"concerned\" by the news, but said that the tour was not in doubt. However, the following day, seven more players tested positive for the virus. Despite the increase in positive tests, Wasim Khan said that the tour was still on, and the team planned to depart for England as scheduled. Anyone who tested positive would be allowed to rejoin the squad after they finished their quarantine period and returned two negative tests. Mohammad Hafeez, one of the seven players to test positive on 23 June 2020, tested negative the following day, after taking a private test to get a second opinion. Six of the ten players who initially tested positive returned a negative when they were tested again. On 27 June 2020, the PCB confirmed that 20 players and 11 members of their support staff would be travelling to England. The flight departed from Allama Iqbal International Airport the following morning, and arrived in Manchester later the same day. On 30 June 2020, the six players that tested negative after initially testing positive, provided a second negative test, and travelled to England as soon as possible. They were joined by three more players who provided two negative tests in four days. In July 2020, Wasim Khan admitted that the PCB came under pressure over whether to tour England after so many players returned a positive test.\nIn June 2020, the International Cricket Council (ICC) made several interim changes to the Playing Conditions due to the pandemic. A substitute could be used for any player showing symptoms of COVID-19, but only in a Test match. Players were banned from using saliva to shine the ball and five penalty runs would be awarded to the opposition for repeated infringements. The requirement to use neutral match officials was temporarily lifted, and the number of DRS reviews for each team in each innings was increased, as the available umpires were less experienced at international level. Following criticism of play being lost in the second Test due to bad light, the ECB agreed that play in the third Test could start half an hour early, at 10:30am, if time was lost during the match due to the weather.\nThe second T20I match was shown free-to-air on BBC One in the United Kingdom, the first time since 1999 that a live cricket match was broadcast on the BBC. Graham Thorpe, England's interim head coach, said that it provides a \"great opportunity for cricket\".\nSquads.\nOn 12 June 2020, the PCB named a touring squad of 29 players for both the Test and T20I matches. The PCB also named Bilal Asif, Imran Butt, Muhammad Musa and Mohammad Nawaz as reserve players for the tour. On 27 July 2020, the PCB shortlisted a 20-man squad for the Test series. On 4 August 2020, this was trimmed down to a 16-man squad ahead of the first Test.\nOn 27 June 2020, due to the high number of positive tests for COVID-19, Rohail Nazir was also added to Pakistan's touring party. Zafar Gohar, who is based in England, joined the team when they arrived in the country, but only took part in pre-match preparations. Kashif Bhatti returned a positive COVID-19 test while in England, but was able to rejoin the squad on 16 July 2020 after two negative tests and a period of self-isolation. On 20 July 2020, Mohammad Amir was added to Pakistan's squad for the T20I matches, following the early birth of his second child; Amir had initially ruled himself out of travelling to England. Amir replaced Haris Rauf, after Rauf provided five positive tests out of six for COVID-19 in the last month. On 30 July 2020, the PCB confirmed that Rauf had returned two consecutive negative tests, and was therefore eligible to fly to England to join the Pakistan squad. On 12 August, Mohammad Hafeez had to self-isolate after breaking biosecurity protocols by posing for a photo with a member of the public at the golf course adjoining the Rose Bowl. Hafeez underwent a COVID-19 test the same afternoon, and returned to the squad the following day, after the test was negative.\nOn 29 July 2020, England named their squad for the first Test, which was unchanged from the side that had beaten the West Indies the previous day. James Bracey, Ben Foakes, Dan Lawrence and Jack Leach were also named as reserve players for the opening fixture. On 9 August 2020, Ben Stokes withdrew from the squad for the final two Test matches to travel to New Zealand due to family reasons; Ollie Robinson was called up in his place. The following day, Lawrence left the England squad to attend a family bereavement, but no replacement for Lawrence was named. On 12 August 2020, Robinson was named in England's squad for the second Test.\nOn 18 August 2020, the ECB named their 14-man squad for the T20Is, also naming Pat Brown, Liam Livingstone and Reece Topley as reserve players. Ahead of the T20I matches, Jason Roy was ruled out of the series, after suffering a side strain.\nPractice matches.\nPakistan were due to play two tour matches, a first-class match against a Select XI side, and a 20-over match against Leicestershire. However, the tour matches were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, Pakistan played intra-squad matches to serve as preparation. A two-day practice match took place in Worcester, ahead of two four-day matches in Derby. On the morning of the second four-day match, the PCB announced that the match would have first-class status.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nAfter winning the toss and electing to bat, Pakistan openers Shan Masood and Abid Ali put on 36 runs for the first wicket, before Abid was bowled by Jofra Archer with the first ball of the 16th over. Captain Azhar Ali fell next to Chris Woakes, trapped lbw for a duck after facing just six balls. The next man in, Babar Azam, reached his fifty in 70 balls, ahead of Masood, and just before a rain delay and an early tea interval. Just eight more overs were bowled before the day's play was called to an early close with Pakistan on 139/2, Babar having reached 69 and Masood still four runs short of his half-century.\nJames Anderson opened the bowling to start the second day, as he had on day 1, and it took him just six balls to remove Babar, caught at first slip by England captain Joe Root for a wicket maiden. Masood then reached his fifty in the following over from Stuart Broad, off a more patient 156 balls. Asad Shafiq fell for seven runs seven overs later, edging a ball from Broad to second slip, followed by Mohammad Rizwan, who was caught behind by Jos Buttler for nine runs for Woakes' second wicket of the innings shortly before the lunch interval. After lunch, Masood and Shadab Khan combined for another fifty-partnership, before Masood reached his third century in his last three Test innings (and the fourth of his career) off 251 balls. The pair batted on to reach the first century partnership of the match, but just two overs later, the spin bowling of Dom Bess tempted Shadab into a slog that came off his top edge and was caught by Root at mid-on. Masood reached 150 runs in the final over before tea, but not before Archer took two more wickets in consecutive balls; first, Yasir Shah was trapped lbw and then Mohammad Abbas was caught at first slip. Masood lasted only until the second over of the session, trapped lbw by Broad with his first ball of the evening, which left just Shaheen Afridi and Naseem Shah. They managed just nine more runs before Shah edged a ball from Broad to Buttler behind the stumps to end the innings at 326. England's first innings began poorly with the loss of three wickets for just 12 runs; after review, Rory Burns was trapped lbw by Afridi, while Abbas had Dom Sibley lbw and then bowled Ben Stokes. Root and Ollie Pope then added 50 to the total for the fourth wicket, only for Root to edge a ball from Yasir Shah to wicket-keeper Rizwan, before Buttler and Pope combined to push England towards 100 runs at the close of play; at the end of the day, Pope was on 46 and England were on 92/4.\nPope reached his fifty early on the third day, but the scoring rate was slow, and shortly after he and Buttler had reached their fifty-partnership, Pope was caught in the gully for 62 off the bowling of Naseem Shah. Buttler and Woakes then batted through to the lunch break, but the second over after the interval saw Yasir Shah beat Buttler's bat with a delivery that went on to hit off stump, and the England batsman was out for 38. Shah also took the next two wickets at regular intervals, as Bess edged him to slip for 1 before Woakes suffered the same fate as Buttler, out bowled. It was then left to Shadab Khan to finish off the England tail, finding the edge of Archer's bat for a catch by Rizwan before trapping Anderson lbw. With Broad not out on 29, England closed their innings on 219 runs, trailing by 107. Pakistan sought to add to their lead with two days and a little over a session left to play, but the hero of their first innings, Shan Masood, was unable to repeat his exploits, out for a duck after a thin edge behind off Broad in the second over. Abid Ali and Azhar Ali got Pakistan through the tea interval, but little further as Abid Ali was tempted into a big shot by Bess, only to see the ball come off the top edge of his bat and caught in the deep by Woakes for 20. Woakes himself then removed Babar Azam for 5, caught in the slips by Stokes, and Azhar Ali, trapped lbw for 18. Asad Shafiq and Mohammad Rizwan put on 38 for the fifth wicket, but a direct hit of the stumps by Sibley saw Shafiq run out for 29 while attempting a quick single. Stokes struck a few overs later, after a Pakistan review confirmed that his delivery to Rizwan would have gone on to hit the stumps; England then used a review in the next over to consign Shadab Khan to the same fate after umpire Richard Illingworth had initially ruled Broad's delivery not out. In the final over of the day, Stokes struck again as a short ball came off the splice of Shaheen Afridi's bat and looped to Rory Burns in the gully. Pakistan finished the day on 137/8, with a lead of 244.\nIn an attempt to set a defendable target for England's batsmen to chase, Pakistan came out with aggressive intent; Yasir Shah hit three fours and a six before edging a ball from Broad behind to Buttler. Naseem Shah showed the same spirit, hitting a four off his first ball, but he was bowled by Archer in the very next over to bring Pakistan's innings to a close on a score of 169. England thus came out with a target of 277 to win the match, and almost two days to get them in. Burns started the brighter of the two openers, scoring 10 runs off the first five overs, but his scoring was throttled back and with the first ball of the 11th over, he was trapped lbw by Abbas without having added to his score. Sibley had passed him, meanwhile, and he and Root worked to add 64 runs to the total before he was tempted into a big shot by Yasir Shah that was edged to the slips with the pair on 36 each. Root was next to go three overs later, as Naseem Shah found his edge to dismiss the England captain for 42. The wicket of Stokes (9) another three overs later, also caught behind off Shah, continued England's mini-collapse, and the loss of Pope for 7 left them at 117/5, still 160 runs from victory. Buttler and Woakes managed to pick up 50 of the required runs before tea, and the pair each reached half-centuries in the 10th over of the final session of the day, followed by the century partnership a few overs later. Buttler ultimately reached 75 before he was trapped lbw by Yasir Shah while attempting a reverse sweep, ending the partnership at 139 runs. Having scored 29 off 25 balls in the first innings, England sent out Broad to join Woakes in the hunt for the remaining 21 runs; he ultimately contributed seven runs to a partnership of 17 as Woakes continued to hold up his end, Broad out lbw to Shah. Bess survived the remainder of that over, leaving Woakes on strike to face Shaheen Afridi with four runs needed; off the first ball of the over, Woakes edged the ball through the slip cordon to the boundary for the required runs. For his unbeaten innings of 84 runs, Woakes was named player of the match."

        "text": "The Ireland cricket team toured England in July and August 2020 to play three One Day International (ODI) matches. Originally due to take place in September 2020, the schedule for the series was rearranged due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All of the fixtures were played behind closed doors, at the Rose Bowl in Southampton, due to the pandemic. The teams last faced each other in a one-off ODI in Dublin in May 2019, with England winning by four wickets.\nThe ODI matches formed part of the inaugural 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, and they were the first matches of the league. Following a trial that started in December 2019, the International Cricket Council (ICC) announced the use of technology to monitor front-foot no-balls for all matches in the Super League. The third umpire called the front-foot no-balls, communicating this with the on-field umpires.\nEngland won the first two ODI matches to take an unassailable series lead. England won the series 2–1, after Ireland won the third and final match of the series. It was Ireland's first win in an ODI against England in England.\nBackground.\nIn April 2020, Cricket Ireland's chief executive, Warren Deutrom, said that Ireland will be \"very flexible\" with regards to possibly rescheduling the fixtures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This included the possibility of playing all three matches behind closed doors, at a venue with enough capacity for all the stakeholders, such as Old Trafford or the Rose Bowl. In May 2020, Cricket Ireland were asked if they could move the fixtures to the end of July, to accommodate the rescheduling of England's fixtures against Australia. Later the same month, Cricket Ireland confirmed that the scheduling for the matches was still under active discussion, despite the cancellation of their home fixtures against New Zealand and Pakistan.\nOn 21 May 2020, a revised schedule due to the pandemic was issued, with all three matches taking place at Old Trafford, starting on 30 July 2020. However, the venue was later changed to the Rose Bowl in Southampton. The series was originally scheduled to take place in September 2020, at Trent Bridge, Edgbaston and The Oval. A week later, the UK government published updated guidance on the resumption of training for elite sports. On 29 May 2020, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) named a 55-man group of players to begin training ahead of international fixtures starting in England. On 8 June 2020, Cricket Ireland confirmed that centrally-contracted players would return to training, and that they were still in discussions with the ECB with regards to playing the three matches. Ireland's captain, Andy Balbirnie, said he was hopeful that the series would go ahead, after a \"very reassuring\" briefing from the ECB. Gary Wilson, Ireland's wicket-keeper, said that \"games against England are massive for us\" and everyone is \"desperate\" for the series to go ahead. On 6 July 2020, the ECB gave the go ahead for the series, and confirmed the fixture schedule.\nOn 17 June 2020, the ECB trimmed the 55-man squad down to a 30-man squad to prepare for the Test matches against the West Indies. On 4 July 2020, England named a thirteen-man squad for the first Test, along with nine reserve players. Some of the cricketers not selected for the Test matches from the initial 30-man squad began preparing for the ODI matches against Ireland. On 9 July 2020, the ECB named a 24-man squad to begin training behind closed doors in preparation for the ODI matches. The next day, Cricket Ireland named a squad of twenty-one players to travel to England. Following the practice matches, fourteen of them will be selected for the ODI squad, with the rest staying in England as cover. On 18 July 2020, Cricket Ireland added Stuart Thompson to their touring squad, ahead of the team's departure from Dublin. On 21 July 2020, the ECB named Moeen Ali as England's vice-captain for the ODI series. On 21 July 2020, Matt Parkinson withdrew from England's 24-man squad, after he suffered an ankle injury.\nIn June 2020, the International Cricket Council (ICC) made several interim changes to the Playing Conditions due to the pandemic. Players were banned from using saliva to shine the ball, with five penalty runs being awarded to the opposition for repeated transgressions. The requirement to use neutral match officials was temporarily lifted, along with an increase to the number of DRS reviews a team can use, due to having less experienced umpires in a match.\nSquads.\nThe ECB named Richard Gleeson, Lewis Gregory and Liam Livingstone as reserve players for the series. Joe Denly was ruled out of England's squad, after suffering from back spasms before the first match. Liam Livingstone replaced Denly in the squad for the remaining fixtures. Ahead of the second ODI, Ireland named Peter Chase and George Dockrell in their squad, replacing Boyd Rankin and Barry McCarthy respectively, after they were both ruled out due to injuries. On the morning of the third and final match, Mark Adair was added to Ireland's squad.\nPractice matches.\nBefore the ODI series, Ireland played two practice matches, with the second match against the England Lions. The twenty-four cricketers named in England's training squad also played two intra-squad practice matches. All four games took place at the Rose Bowl."

Named Stade Rouennais, their primary objective of reaching Fédérale 2 was achieved in 2013.\nSeeking further progress, Stade Rouennais hired Richard Hill, former captain of the England team and finalist of the 1991 World Cup, as General Manager in 2013. Under his management the club stabilized itself in Fédérale 2 and then gained promotion to Fédérale 1 in 2014–15.\nAfter this meteoric rise Normand entrepreneurs Jean-Louis Louvel and Eric Leroy invested in the club by becoming the presidents. The club was renamed Rouen Normandie Rugby. The goal was to professionalize the club and extend it to all of Normandy. Richard Hill committed to the club until 2023.\nThese changes were beneficial, since for the first time in the history of Normandy rugby, Richard Hill lead Rouen Normandy Rugby to become Champion of France of the highest amateur level in 2016–17.\nDuring the 2018–19 Fédérale 1 season Hill led Rouen to victory in the Jean Pratt Trophy, which automatically promoted them to Pro D2.\nCurrent squad.\nThe Rouen squad for the 2022–23 season is:"

He was a member of the Legislative Council three times between 1911 and 1923.\nBiography.\nThomas was born in Clarence in Tasmania to William Isaac Thomas and Kezia Celia Thomas (née Chapman). His father was a lawyer and moved to Fiji to practice in Levuka. Thomas was present at the signing of the Deed of Cession in 1874, which transformed the Kingdom of Fiji into the Colony of Fiji. He started work as a clerk before moving to Yaqara to manage an estate owned by his father. After being joined by his brother Willie, the two opened butchers shops in Ba and Lautoka. \nThomas contested the new Northern constituency in the 1911 general election and was elected to the Legislative Council. In the 1914 elections he ran in the new Western seat, and was re-elected. Although he lost his seat to Reginald Harricks in the 1917 elections, he stood again in the constituency in 1920 and was returned to the Legislative Council, defeating John Percy Bayly as Harricks did not defend his seat. Thomas was unseated again in the 1923 elections, losing to Percival William Faddy. He subsequently unsuccessfully contested the seat again in the 1926 and 1929 elections, losing to Faddy and Bayly respectively.\nThomas died at Lautoka Hospital on 23 May 1948 at the age of 86."

        "text": "The 1982–83 Wisconsin Badgers men's ice hockey team represented the University of Wisconsin–Madison in college ice hockey. In its first year under head coach Jeff Sauer, the team compiled a 33–10–2 record. The Badgers won the 1983 national championship, their fourth title.\nSeason.\nEarly season trouble.\nAfter finishing as the runner up the year before, head coach Bob Johnson left to become the bench boss of the Calgary Flames. He was replaced by former assistant and long-time Colorado College coach Jeff Sauer. The team was very experienced, having made the national championship game in each of the previous two seasons, but early on the squad appeared to have a rough time adjusting to their new coach's style. The team took 3 out of a possible 4 points against eventual CCHA champion Bowling Green in their season opener but the following weekend, back at home, they could only manage a split with Dalhousie. When they opened their conference schedule at the end of October the team couldn't win either contest against Minnesota, leaving the Badgers with a mediocre 2–2–2 record. The following weekend Wisconsin welcomed their coach's former team to Madison and won three games over four days to vastly improve their conference standing. UW held firm with a home split against the Golden Gophers then lost a road series at North Dakota to drop their WCHA record back to .500.\nWinning streak.\nWisconsin returned closer to home in late November to face a terrible Illinois–Chicago team and needed overtime to pull out a win. After such a poor performance the team collected itself and game out firing two days later against Air Force, dominating the Falcons in one of the most lopsided series in team history (The Badgers outscored Air Force 27–1 in the two games). After the offensive outburst the Badgers relaxed a bit and were beaten at home by Minnesota–Duluth before salvaging a split in the second game. The win in Duluth was a turning point for the Badgers, who later admitted it was the first time where they really listened to their new coach. With their first win in December, Wisconsin began a stretch of 11 consecutive victories, the first seven coming at home followed by a further 4 in Colorado before CC stopped their streak. When it was over the Badgers were in the thick of the race for the WCHA title and, with 20 wins already, had a good chance at a berth in the NCAA tournament regardless of the WCHA tournament.\nStumbling down the stretch.\nUnfortunately, after losing to Colorado College, Wisconsin faced defending national champion North Dakota and the Fighting Sioux got the better of them again, taking 3 of 4 points and putting UND up in the conference standings by 3. After managing a split with Duluth the week after Wisconsin found themselves 5 points behind both UND and Minnesota with only 4 games remaining but when the Gophers swept the Fighting Sioux the following weekend the Badgers' two wins over Denver put them just behind North Dakota for a first round bye. Wisconsin needed to win against Minnesota and get help from Duluth, both of which happened on the last Friday of the regular season, but the Golden Gophers recovered for a split and Wisconsin watched second place slip away when North Dakota won their season finale.\nWCHA tournament.\nWith their 3rd-place finish the Badgers were forced to play in the first round of the conference tournament but fortunately they faced the 6–26–1 CC Tigers. The series was closer than may have been expected but Wisconsin won in the end and advanced to face a rested North Dakota in the Semifinals. Despite not having won any of the previous 5 games, Wisconsin was not fazed by UND's run to repeat as champion and the two teams fought to a 1–1 deadlock in game one. No overtime was used because the two-game series was decided on aggregate but the two squads battled in another defensive contest until North Dakota scored twice early in the third. The Badgers rallied from being down by two twice but still found themselves behind with just seconds to play. With Marc Behrend on the bench future Hall of Famer Chris Chelios scored the tying goal with 12 seconds to play and sending the game into overtime. The first two extra periods passed without a goal being scored but just 62 seconds into the third overtime Ted Pearson notched the game-winner. While Wisconsin celebrated the referees checked the length of Pearson's stick and ruled it illegal. As a result, the goal was waved off and Pearson was given a 2-minute penalty. With both teams exhausted the game didn't last much longer but, surprisingly, North Dakota allowed the first short-handed goal against all season when Paul Houck scored just 26 seconds into the power-play.\nWith an NCAA berth all but ensured, Wisconsin headed to Minneapolis to take on the WCHA Champion and swept Minnesota to win their second consecutive WCHA championship, the seventh in team history.\nNCAA tournament.\nWisconsin was given the top western seed and were slotted to face St. Lawrence who were making their first tournament appearance in over 20 years. The veteran Badgers overwhelmed the Saints, beating the ECAC team soundly in both games to take the series 13–3, the largest margin of victory in any NCAA aggregate series. In the National Semifinal Wisconsin faced a tougher opponent in Providence but were still miles ahead with Behrend being called on to make only 17 saves in the 2–0 shutout.\nWisconsin made their 3rd consecutive championship game, the fifth time in history a team was able to accomplish that feat, but the only time a program did so with two different head coaches. They also faced their third different opponent, this time in the form of Harvard who were in their first championship game after 7 previous trips to the Frozen Four. The badgers jumped out to an early lead, just 7 minutes into the contest, while Behrend held the fort and kept the Crimson scoreless. Patrick Flatley's second goal came with 4 minutes left in the second to build a 2-goal lead and just under seven minutes of game-time later Wisconsin was up by 3. Harvard finally managed to score mid-way through the final frame but each of their two goals were answered by the Badgers and John Johannson empty-net goal sealed the victory for the Badgers.\nAwards and honors.\nIn allowing just 5 goals in the 4 games, Marc Behrend was awarded the Tournament MOP for the second time. He became just the second player to be honored twice and the only one to win on both occasions (Lou Angotti is the only other multiple-time winner as of 2019). Wisconsin played 4 players on the All-Tournament Team with Behrend joined by Chris Chelios, Patrick Flatley and Paul Houck. Behrend finished second in the nation with a 2.23 GAA and was tops with a .921 winning percentage but neither mark was good enough to get him named to the All-American West Team. The only Bader All-American was Flatley who was also the only First Team All-WCHA player. though Chelios, Houck and Bruce Driver made the second team. Jeff Sauer became the first person to win a championship in his inaugural season as head coach with a new team and was later joined by Brad Berry in 2016. The Badgers finished the tournament with a +16 goal differential, tying the mark held jointly by 1950 Colorado College and 1953 Michigan.\nStandings.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nPlayers drafted into the NHL.\n1983 NHL Entry Draft.\nNo Wisconsin players were selected in the NHL draft."

        "title": "The Golf Pro",
        "text": "The Golf Pro (full title: The Golf Pro Featuring Gary Player) is a 1998 golf video game developed and published by Empire Interactive for Microsoft Windows. The game features professional golfer Gary Player, as well as two golf courses and a mouse-controlled golf swing method known as Mouse Drive. The game was generally praised for its graphics, but criticized for its limited camera angles. By early 1999, \"The Golf Pro 2\" had been released in the United Kingdom.\nGameplay.\n\"The Golf Pro\" features three playable golfers, including professional golfer Gary Player, who also provides advice to the player. Two real golf courses are featured: St Mellion, and Hilton Head (designed by Gary Player). To take a golf swing, the player uses a method known as Mouse Drive, in which the computer mouse is moved side-to-side to simulate the swing. Letting go of the left mouse button at certain points in the process alters the height or distance of the swing, depending on when the button is let go. For an adequate golf swing, the player must turn the mouse at certain points to alter the performance of the club head. The Mouse Drive uses precise movements from the computer mouse, and a mouse calibration process must be completed before playing. The game features commentary relating to the player's golfing.\nDevelopment and release.\n\"The Golf Pro\" was developed and published by British company Empire Interactive, and was released for Microsoft Windows. The game was in development in 1996, but its release was delayed. The real golf courses were surveyed for use in the game. The game's courses include elements from their real-life counterparts such as trees and hazards. The game's digitized golfers were video-captured using high-speed film. The Mouse Drive uses 12,000 frames of animation to represent more than 90 potential golf swing variations. The game does not include a traditional click-based swing method, as Empire Interactive felt confident that the Mouse Drive would be adequate on its own. David Pringle, the game's project manager, said, \"There's only so much you can do with the traditional click-click-click system. […] After using our Mouse Drive system, few players will wish to return to the traditional method.\"\nAlistair Cochran was brought in to improve the game physics. Cochran was an expert on golf physics, and was the scientific advisor to The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. Pringle described Cochran as \"basically the expert world-wide on what happens when a club hits a ball.\" Pringle said he was glad that Cochran worked on the game \"because it means the ball physics are a lot better than they would have been.\"\nIn the United States, the game was released on 1 April 1998. The game had also been released in the United Kingdom by that time. At the time of its release, the game did not include a multiplayer feature, although one was intended to be added in later through a patch. Upon release, the game featured computer-controlled golfers for the player to compete against, although they lacked artificial intelligence and their actions were pre-recorded, making their gameplay the same during each round.\nReception.\n\"The Golf Pro\" was generally praised for its graphics. Some critics also praised the game physics, with Tasos Kaiafas of \"GameSpot\" calling them \"impressively realistic, so much so that the game could be used as an instructional tool.\" The game was criticized for its limited camera angles, and the small number of courses also received some criticism. Kaiafas was disappointed by the game's graphics, which are pre-rendered.\nGordon Goble of \"Computer Gaming World\" praised the realism of the Mouse Drive and wrote that \"The Golf Pro\" \"does mouse driving better, and with more innovation and complexity, than the competition.\" Patrick McCarthy of \"PC Zone\" praised the game but stated that players would need to practice the Mouse Drive in order to use it adequately. Kaiafas stated that for players who have the patience to practice using the Mouse Drive, \"\"The Golf Pro\" does present some new challenges that can be fun to master.\" James Bottorff of \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\" wrote that the Mouse Drive \"offers as real a swing as I've seen on the PC. […] This is a welcome change from the traditional three-click approach.\"\nThe \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" wrote, \"For all its complexities, the Mouse Drive isn't that difficult to pick up\" thanks to the advice given by Gary Player. Jeff Lackey of \"Computer Games Strategy Plus\" wrote, \"If \"The Golf Pro\" had come out a couple of years ago, it would have been hailed as an excellent golf sim. In today's environment, it is an average golf sim with a great swing interface.\" Steve Owen of \"PC Gamer UK\" praised the commentary and called \"The Golf Pro\" a \"very accomplished, impressive and enjoyable game, but there is little that is truly astounding or original about it.\" Owen criticized the difficult putting, and stated that the Mouse Drive would have been an innovative feature in 1996, but that the game's \"unexpected delay, however, means that everyone else has got there first.\" In a 1999 review, Mark Hill of \"PC Zone\" wrote that \"there's no excuse for not including an alternative\" to the Mouse Drive. Hill considered the \"Links\" series and the \"Tiger Woods\" series superior.\n\"The Golf Pro\" was a runner-up for \"Best Sports Game\" in \"PC Zone\"s 1998 Reader Awards, losing to \"World Cup 98\".\n\"The Golf Pro 2\".\nBy early 1999, \"The Golf Pro 2\" had been released in the United Kingdom. It features Gary Player and one golf course: Wentworth. Craig Vaughan of \"PC Zone\" rated it 70 out of 100, stating that while the name suggests a sequel, \"\"The Golf Pro 2\" is merely a disappointing course data disc that fails to deliver anything radically new.\" Vaughan further described it as a \"half-price, cut-down version of the excellent \"The Golf Pro\".\" \"PC Gamer UK\"s Steve Owen rated it 80 percent and again criticized the putting, while stating that the game seemed like an add-on disc."

Former Club secretary and NSWRFL Vice President Clarrie Fahy recruited him after spotting the rangy forward running around for a railways side at Katoomba in the Blue Mountains in 1928.\n\"They were all good moments,\" Mr Sharp recalled of his years with the Saints. \"St George was a great club. 'Snowy' Justice was the captain at the time. He was the hooker – I liked him and I got on well with him.\".\nAfter 4 seasons at Saints, Joe Sharp joined Balmain in 1933 and later Canterbury-Bankstown due to residential rules of the time.\nSharp died on 31 July 2006 aged 100 at East Gosford, New South Wales."

        "title": "Match of the Century (tennis)",
        "text": "The Match of the Century was a tennis match in February 1926 known for being the only career meeting between Suzanne Lenglen and Helen Wills, the two preeminent female tennis players of the 1920s. The meeting took place in the final of the February edition of the Carlton Club tournament in Cannes on the French Riviera. Lenglen won the match in straight sets by a score of 6–3, 8–6.\nBackground.\nThe Match of the Century between Suzanne Lenglen and Helen Wills was contested in the women's singles final of the February edition of the Carlton Club tournament, a middle-tier tournament on the French Riviera circuit. Lenglen and Wills were widely considered to be the two best women's tennis players in the world at the time. They had never faced each other in singles or doubles before this meeting, and had not played against each other in mixed doubles either until a week earlier. Although the Carlton Club tournament itself was not particularly significant, a huge amount of anticipation for a match between Lenglen and Wills had been building up for a few years. While there was particular interest in a match at the French Championships or Wimbledon that June, the press considered it inevitable that they would play at least once if not several times before then on the Riviera circuit once Wills decided to travel to France with the intent of competing on the Riviera, where Lenglen resided and typically began her season. As there were no tournaments that players were required to enter, it was not initially clear where any of the matches would take place. Lenglen, Wills, and some of the leading hotel owners and tennis manufacturers with controlling interests on the Riviera ultimately agreed to set up the first potential meeting at the Carlton Club tournament.\nCompetitors.\nSuzanne Lenglen.\nSuzanne Lenglen was a 26-year-old French tennis player who was widely acknowledged as the best women's player in the world at the time. She had been ranked No. 1 in the world by A. Wallis Myers in 1925, a position she had held for five consecutive years since the rankings began in 1921. She entered the Carlton Club event on a 163-match win streak, having not lost a singles match in over four years. Lenglen was a six-time Wimbledon champion, then second-most at the time behind Dorothea Lambert Chambers. She had lost just one match in singles and three sets in total since the end of World War I, a period of seven years. Lenglen was rarely challenged in singles, as further evidenced by the lopsided scores with which she won the overwhelming majority of her matches. \nThe press presented Lenglen with a mythical persona, calling her \"La Divine\" (the Goddess) and writing about her as if she was infallible at tennis. The way she was described and regularly highlighted in the press made her immensely popular among tennis fans and drew people to watch her matches who were not otherwise interested in tennis. Her biggest matches often sold out and potentially had upwards of a few thousand fans were unable to purchase seated tickets or gain entry at all. With her popularity and high-profile acquaintances, she has been recognized as the first female athlete to become an international celebrity outside of her sport.\nHelen Wills.\nHelen Wills was a 20-year-old American tennis player who was regarded as an up-and-coming star and one of the only players who could potentially defeat Lenglen, if not the only one. She had been ranked No. 2 in the world by A. Wallis Myers after the 1925 season by virtue of having won the U.S. National Championships the previous three years. Her first two such titles came against compatriot Molla Mallory, the only player to defeat Lenglen in singles after World War I. The third title was a victory over British player Kitty McKane, who had previously defeated Wills in the 1924 Wimbledon final.\nPlayer comparison.\nThe two players also dealt with illness in opposite ways. Lenglen had developed a reputation for potentially faking illnesses when she was nervous, while Wills did not attribute poor performances to her health even when she was sick.\nLead-up to the match.\nMissed encounters in previous years.\nThe hype for a match between Lenglen and Wills began in late 1923 following Wills's first major title at the U.S. National Championships. Their first encounter was expected to take place in 1924 when Wills made her first trip to Europe to compete in the Wightman Cup against Great Britain before partaking in Wimbledon and the Olympics later that summer. However, such a meeting never materialized. In April, Lenglen contracted jaundice in Spain after winning the Barcelona International. This illness prevented her from playing another competitive match until Wimbledon and notably kept her out of the French Championships, where she was the four-time defending champion. Although both Lenglen and Wills entered Wimbledon in late June, Lenglen had not fully recovered. She entered her quarterfinal against her doubles partner Elizabeth Ryan as an overwhelming favorite, having not lost a game in any of her first three matches. Although she defeated Ryan, she dropped the middle set, the first set of tennis she had lost in singles since 1921. Following the match, Lenglen withdrew from the tournament, asserting she had not yet recovered from her illness. She did not play another match that year. In the other half of the draw, Wills reached the final without losing more than two games in any set. Though, she could not capitalize on Lenglen's withdrawal and ultimately finished runner-up to Kitty McKane despite taking the first set. A week later, Wills did take advantage of Lenglen's absence at the 1924 Olympics in Paris, winning the gold medals in both singles and doubles. This Olympic success bolstered her popularity in the United States and helped her rise to a level of stardom comparable to that of Lenglen, adding more interest for a match between tennis's two leading female stars.\nWills did not return to Europe in 1925, instead focusing on her college studies as a sophomore at the University of California at Berkeley in the early part of the year and competing in tournaments on the east coast of the United States during the summer. During that year, Lenglen reestablished that she was unbeatable, going undefeated in both singles and doubles, and winning titles in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles at both the first open French Championships as well as Wimbledon. In the United States, Wills was unable to match Lenglen's level of success. Although she won the U.S. National Championships for the third year in a row, needed three sets to defeat Kitty McKane in the final and lost a singles match in straight sets to Elizabeth Ryan at a lead-up tournament. She also lost the decisive doubles match in the Wightman Cup to the visiting British pair of McKane and Evelyn Colyer. With these lapses, Wills had yet to attain the reputation of unassailability that Lenglen had. As a result, Lenglen was still regarded as the best player of the world and a clear favourite in a potential match against Wills.\nEarly Riviera season.\nWills announced in late December 1925 that she was planning to travel to France the next month with one of her goals being to face Lenglen in a tournament on the French Riviera, where Lenglen typically played the majority of her season outside of the Grand Slam tournaments. A keen artist, Wills was adamant that having the opportunity to paint and continue her art studies were part of her underlying motivation for the trip as well. Wills left the United States from New York City with her mother on 6 January and arrived in Le Havre on 15 January, taking a boat train to Paris and then reaching the Riviera on \"Le Train Bleu\" the following morning. They were greeted in Paris by over a thousand people, including reporters, officials from the French Tennis Federation (FFT), and a leading French male tennis player Jean Borotra. Pierre Gillou, who was the president of the FFT, and Borotra escorted them to Cannes.\nThe French Riviera season lasted from late December through April and attracted many of the best players in the world in the lead-up to the French Championships in early June and the Wimbledon Championships in late June, Europe's two Grand Slam tournaments. Despite the Riviera being in France, the players and spectators at these events were predominantly British. Lenglen had already played three tournaments before Wills's arrival. She did not enter the singles events at any of these tournaments, consistent with her usual schedule of only playing doubles and mixed doubles early in the season as she had done in previous years. Wills entered tournaments in all three weeks after she arrived before the Carlton Club tournament. She played at the Metropole Hotel and the Gallia Lawn Tennis Club in Cannes before commuting to Nice to play at the Nice Lawn Tennis Club. Lenglen and Wills avoided meeting at either of the first two tournaments, as Wills only entered singles at the Metropole Hotel while Lenglen only played the doubles and mixed doubles at that tournament and then did not enter the Gallia Club tournament. They could not meet in singles in Nice either as only Lenglen had entered singles; however, they set up their first potential meetings by both entering the doubles and mixed doubles events.\nThe press expected a singles match between Lenglen and Wills to take place at the Nice Lawn Tennis Club as this was Lenglen's home club. As such, Lenglen had already only entered doubles at the Metropole Hotel and stood by that decision when Wills decided to enter the singles event. She then missed the Gallia Club tournament altogether due to her father's illness. Wills demonstrated that she was in good form at both tournaments, winning both singles events. During this time, she also gained favor in the press and among fans. Her opening match had a record level of attendance for the Riviera. At the Metropole Hotel though, she lost eight games twice in straight set wins against high-ranked players Hélène Contostavlos and Julie Vlasto, opponents Lenglen had routinely defeated in the past while conceding far fewer games. That gap in performance led the press to assert she would not have a chance against Lenglen; however, she partially nullified that assessment by only losing five games to Contostavlos in the Gallia Club final. Meanwhile, Wills lost in the semifinals of the mixed doubles event at the Gallia Club, largely due to the fault of her aged partner George Hillyard.\nContrary to expectation, Lenglen continued to avoid a singles match with Wills in Nice in accordance with leading business interests on the Riviera. When Wills entered the singles event, Lenglen withdrew, which was highly uncharacteristic given that the tournament was at her club. Wills ultimately withdrew from the singles event for an unclear reason, however, prompting Lenglen to reenter. She may have withdrawn because she only needed to commute from Cannes to play the doubles events, which better suited her mother's preference not to relocate to Nice for just one week. She may have also not wanted to face Lenglen at her own club, or to play a singles match against her with the slower type of ball known as a \"groover\" in use at the tournament. Although they could have met in both doubles and mixed doubles, Lenglen defaulted from the doubles event after the first round because her partner Phyllis Satterthwaite was injured in a car accident. Lenglen and Wills both reached the mixed doubles final, setting up their first encounter. Playing alongside Uberto De Morpurgo, Lenglen defeated Wills and Charles Aeschlimann while only dropping three games and easily nullifying the strategy of Wills and Aeschlimann to keep Lenglen and De Morpurgo at the baseline with repeated lobs. The result was not considered surprising because Wills had not been expected to reach the final with the lower-ranked Aeschlimann as her partner and did not influence expectations for a potential singles encounter.\nWills's amateur status.\nDuring the Riviera season, the French press questioned Wills's amateur status over the issue of Wills agreeing to write a series of articles on her matches for the International News Service (INS). She had obtained sponsorship from the INS instead of the United States Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA) because the USLTA did not want her to travel to Europe until much later that spring to play in an international team competition while representing the United States. The USLTA, however, had an unrelated player-writer rule at the time that forbade players from writing for income about tournaments in which they were playing. In response to the press allegations, the USLTA conducted an investigation of whether Wills violated the rule. At the time of the investigation, Wills had yet to publish any of her writing for the INS. The USLTA ultimately cleared Wills of any wrongdoing on the basis of her statement that she intended to write about aspects of how to play tennis rather than the tournaments themselves. Spectators on the Riviera supported Wills in this matter upon finding out that she was stressed over the possibility of losing her amateur status.\nBesides the investigation into Wills's writing, the press also questioned Wills for selling some of her artwork to various newspapers to help finance the trip. Among the works she sold was a sketch of Lenglen for $500. She was able to sell her work for such a high price largely because of her popularity as a tennis player rather than her artistic skill. Nonetheless, Wills was never investigated for these sales because the USLTA did not have a rule against the selling of art and the newspapers were officially making the purchases as art and not news. Because of the initial concerns, Wills also checked with the USLTA over whether the match itself could threaten her amateur status due to the large commercial interest in the event. They verified the business interests were not an issue because the players were not the ones profiting off of the match.\nTournament.\nSelection of the Carlton Club.\nLenglen and Wills both entered the singles and doubles events at the Carlton Club tournament, setting up their first potential encounter in singles in particular. The Carlton Club was chosen as the location for the match by the leading businessmen on the French Riviera who represented the hotels and tennis-related manufacturers. The hotel representatives were highlighted by the three owners of the Carlton Club, namely John Burke and his sons Albert and Edmund, all of whom were Irish professional tennis players. The tennis businessmen included Francis Fisher and Jacques Brugnon, both of whom were representing the Dunlop Company and were also tennis players themselves.\nLenglen's father, who was also a manager at the Nice Lawn Tennis Club, had wanted the first match to be held at their club. However, the hotel owners and tennis companies were against holding the match in Nice because they expected Lenglen to win the match with ease based on Wills's performance in her first two tournaments. They thought that if Lenglen won too easily, there would be much less to gain financially from a rematch on the Riviera later on. They wanted to delay the match to the Carlton Club the following week to give Wills more time to become accustomed to the conditions and the clay courts on the Riviera with the hope that would make the match more competitive and fuel interest in a rematch. That rematch could potentially take place at the South of France Championships in March, which was hosted by the Nice Lawn Tennis Club and was the largest tournament on the Riviera. In the meantime, another week's delay also amplified interest for the match in the global press and among fans, increasing the opportunity for profit. Fisher and Brugnon made one of the conditions for holding the match at the Carlton Club to be that the tournament use their Dunlop balls, which the Burkes agreed to in spite of objections from some of the club's members. Lenglen was persuaded to abide by these expectations and Wills followed suit, thereby moving the match to the Carlton Club against the wishes of Lenglen's father. The February tournament was one of two editions that the Carlton Club hosted annually, the other taking place in April.\nPath to the final.\nWith 58 competitors entered in the women's singles draw at the February edition of the Carlton Club, the event was played as a standard six-round single-elimination knockout bracket. Lenglen and Wills were intentionally placed on opposite sides of the draw to ensure the only match in which they could meet would be the final. Although they each needed to get through the five rounds to ensure that they meet, it was regarded as a foregone conclusion that they would both reach the final due to the gap in playing ability between them and the other players.\nNeither Lenglen, nor Wills lost a game in any of their first three singles matches and both lost just two games in their fourth match. Although the tournament had been scheduled from Monday to Sunday, no matches were played for three days from Tuesday through Thursday due to heavy rain. As Lenglen had a bye in the first round, Wills had an extra match to play against Julie Vlasto in the semifinals. When Vlasto took a 4–1 lead in the second set, she was heavily booed over the possibility of her interfering with a Lenglen–Wills final. Nonetheless, Wills recovered to win the next five games and the match, solidifying a match in the final against Lenglen. During this last set, however, Wills fell in the middle of a rally and suffered a cut on her right knee that was bleeding out. Wills retrieved treatment for the cut after the semifinal and dismissed it as unimportant. She was largely successful in hiding the extent of the injury from the press at the time.\nVenue.\nThe Carlton Club was not that large, consisting of just six courts. American sportswriter John Tunis described the setting as a \"tawdry little excuse for a tennis club\". The courts themselves were positioned in a way so that the players were nearly always facing the Sun, except between 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM. As such, the final was scheduled for 11:15 AM to avoid that issue.\nThe capacity on the main court was not anywhere near close to being able to accommodate all of the people interested in attending the match. Once the second semifinal concluded, workers arrived to construct a secondary set of bleachers that would greatly increase the seating capacity. Tickets for these seats were not sold until 9:00 AM on the day of the match, only about two hours before the match itself. Fans interested in buying these tickets began to form a line outside the club the afternoon before the day of the match, some of which paid people to hold their place in line for that afternoon or overnight. The makeshift bleachers were still being built on the morning of the match and were not completed until within an hour of the scheduled start time of the match. As such, there was no time for the building inspector to test the safety of the bleachers; however, the lack of safety awareness largely did not concern or deter the ticketed spectators. Seated tickets were sold out at 300 francs each, already about six times more than the cost of tickets at the U.S. National Championship men's singles final, which were sold at as low as $2 per seat at the time. In addition to seated tickets, standing room was also sold out at 100 francs per person. Moreover, many tickets were scalped at up to 1200 francs, equivalent to about $48.\nThe attendance at the match was estimated to be between 3000 and 6000 depending on who was counted. In addition to the thousands of ticketed spectators, there were far more outside the venue who found alternative ways to see the match. Some people who could not get into the venue climbed eucalyptus trees or ladders that they had rented to get a glimpse of the match. The owner of a villa across the street sold standing room at 20 francs for people to watch the match from their upper-floor windows. After their window space overflowed, they dismantled tiles from their roof and sold attic space in which people could bring chairs to stand on and see the match by peering out from the part of the roof with removed tiles. Tunis commented, \"Pretty soon every house in the vicinity looked half undressed, a hundred faces stucks out of the attics as though the villas were made of cardboard.\" The Carlton Hotel overlooking the court followed suit and also had people watching the match from their window balconies. There was also a large group of people who watched the match from the roof of the Carlton Club garage.\nMatch summary.\nTournament referee George Simond chose the match officials, all of whom were agreed upon by Lenglen and Wills. The chair umpire was George Hillyard. The six linesmen were Cyril Tolley, Clement Cazalet, Roman Najuch, Francis Towle, Charles Hope, and Reginald Dunkerley. All of the officials were British. Simond, Hillyard, Tolley, Najuch, Cazalet, and Dunkerley were tennis players themselves. Tolley was also a British Amateur golf champion, while Towle was a hotel magnate. There was no foot fault judge, possibly as a result of a series of foot faults being called against Lenglen in her semifinal match.\nFirst set.\nAfter Wills took an early lead in the match, Lenglen rebounded to win the first set comfortably. The set began with both players holding serve, Lenglen to love and Wills to 30 after falling behind 15–30. Wills carried over the momentum from her service game to break Lenglen and take a 2–1 lead. Although Lenglen had initially saved two break points at 15–40, Wills was eventually able to break on a long point that ended with her hitting a defensive cross-court backhand winner far up the line from well behind the baseline. The final shot prompted a standing ovation from the crowd, who did not expect Lenglen's well-placed previous shot to be returned, let alone hit for a winner. Wills' performance in this game convinced the spectators that Wills could compete with Lenglen and in turn that the match would be competitive.\nNonetheless, Lenglen was able to break Wills in her next three service games after devising a new tactic. In the first three games, she observed that Wills only attempted cross-court backhand winners, never hitting her backhand up the line. Lenglen took advantage of this weakness beginning in the fourth game by hitting drop shots to lure Wills into the net. If Wills was able to get to the drop shot, Lenglen would follow it up with a passing shot to win the point. She had little difficulty in setting up these drop shots because she knew where to position herself whenever Wills was hitting a backhand shot. Meanwhile, Wills lacked the speed to hit a good offensive return off of Lenglen's drop shots. This strategy also made Wills do more running and tired her later in the match. Lenglen's first two breaks and a service hold gave her a 4–2 lead.\nHaving lost three games in a row, Wills changed her own tactics and opted to come to the net voluntarily in Lenglen's next service game. This strategy helped her get another break to get to 3–4 after Lenglen was only able to hit one passing shot in the game. However, Lenglen was able to adjust and get her third break of serve in the next game by hitting deep lobs instead of passing shots whenever Wills came to the net. She then consolidated the break to win the set 6–3. Despite taking the first set, Lenglen went to her mother in the stands for a glass of cognac in-between sets, a practice she was known for doing in her most competitive matches beginning with the 1919 Wimbledon final. Conversely, Wills was not dismayed by losing the first set, as she had a reputation for starting matches slowly only to end up winning in three sets.\nSecond set.\nThe second set was more competitive than the first. After three service holds to begin the set, Wills again picked up the first break to take a 3–1 lead. She continued to employ her strategy of coming to the net on every point and not giving Lenglen good opportunities to hitting passing shots. At this point, Lenglen stalled the match and again went to the stands for another glass of cognac. When she returned to the court, she broke back as Wills began playing more passively and stopped coming to the net in an effort to conserve energy. After Lenglen held serve to level the set at 3–3, the two competitors played what turned out to be the longest game of the match. Wills began the game trailing 15–40, but saved both break points by coming to the net. She then missed two routine shots on game points before prevailing on the fourteenth point of the game, an unforced error by Lenglen two points after the fourth deuce.\nWith Wills leading 4–3, the next game became the most controversial. After Lenglen briefly left the court a third time for more cognac, Wills took a 15–30 lead in Lenglen's service game. The next point featured a long rally that ended with Lenglen hitting the ball cross-court near the intersection of the service line and the sideline. Although the shot was called good, it is generally accepted that linesman Cyril Tolley missed the call. Reporter Don Skene in particular noted that it landed wide by \"three inches at least\". Wills, who typically had a calm demeanor, became enraged and screamed at Tolley to question his call. Although the spectators also backed Wills, the call stood and Lenglen ended up winning the game. Wills then held serve in a game that went to deuce. Lenglen followed suit with a hold to love to keep the set level at 5–5.\nIn the next game, Lenglen broke Wills to 30 to give herself the chance to serve for the match. She took a 40–15 lead in her service game to earn two match points. The first match point became another critical juncture in the match. Lenglen and Wills engaged in a long rally that ended with Wills hitting a powerful cross-court forehand into the corner near the line. Both players, the umpire, and the crowd heard the ball called out, signaling the end of the match. Within moments, photographers and reporters flooded the court and pictures were taken of Lenglen and Wills about to shake hands at the net. However, linesman Charles Hope told the umpire that the ball was in and the call had from a spectator in the stands. Several minutes were needed to clear out all of the people and flowers on the court so that play could resume. When the match continued, Wills won the next three points to break Lenglen and level the match at 6–6.\nBoth players had game points in each of the final two games of the match. Wills could not carry her momentum into her service game and fell behind 0–40. Although she won the next four points, Lenglen responded by taking the last three points and the game, setting up a second chance to serve out the match. Wills had a break point at 30–40 and a second after Lenglen had a rare double fault at deuce. However, Lenglen saved both break chances, and won the next two points to earn a third match point. On Lenglen's second shot of the point, she drew Wills into the net with a drop shot that she was barely able to get back. Wills's weak subsequent shot gave Lenglen enough time to run up to near the service line and hit a volley for a winner to end the match 6–3, 8–6.\nPress coverage.\nThere was immense interest in covering the match and the lead-up events and activities of both players from when Wills arrived in France. A large number of journalists travelled to the French Riviera from Europe, North America, and South America to cover the match weeks in advance, creating an intense competition for information about anything related to Lenglen and Wills. As a result, not all information published was truthful. This predicament was further complicated by Wills initially avoiding most interview attempts as part of her agreement with the INS to write her own stories. The American journalists present included John Tunis for the \"American Lawn Tennis\" magazine and \"The New Yorker\", Allison Danzig for \"The New York Times\", James Thurber for the Riviera edition of \"The Chicago Tribune\", Al Laney for \"Paris Herald\", Paul Gallico for the \"New York Daily News\", and Grantland Rice for \"Collier's\" magazine. The French journalists included Gaston Leroux for \"Le Journal\". The British journalists included A. Wallis Myers. Spanish novelist Vicente Blasco Ibáñez was paid 40,000 francs to cover the match despite a lack of familiarity with tennis.\nAftermath.\nDoubles final.\nLenglen and Wills also faced each other in the doubles final at the Carlton Club tournament, partnering with Julie Vlasto and Hélène Contostavlos respectively. Neither of them had lost a set in the doubles event either. The doubles final was scheduled a little after 2:00 PM, and started only about two hours after the singles final ended. A large fraction of those in attendance for the first match of the day did not stay for the second one. In particular, nearly all of the reporters left the venue so that they could finish their stories and send them back to their respective newspapers. As a result, the second match was almost entirely left out of any newspaper coverage. Although the crowd for the doubles match was smaller, they showed less respect for the players, shouting throughout the match and breaking the usual convention of staying silent during points.\nHaving already lost the singles final, Wills played more recklessly in the doubles final. She came to the net on every point and regularly poached shots from her partner. Wills also deliberately tried to hit shots toward Lenglen to continue to test who was the better player. Lenglen and Vlasto countered Wills's strategy by hitting their shots away from Wills, either by aiming in the direction of Contostavlos or executing lobs over Wills. Lenglen was noticeably tired during the late stages of the second set and had to rely on Vlasto to help finish the match. Despite both sets being close, Lenglen and Vlasto defeated Wills and Contostavlos 6–4, 8–6, a similar scoreline to the singles final. Their victory was attributed to Contostavlos's performance as the least accomplished player among the four competitors. Even though Wills lost, the aggressiveness of her approach to the match helped her win favor among the remaining crowd. They celebrated Wills's performance at the end of the match despite Lenglen's winning and having cheered Lenglen at the end of the first match of the day.\nLater Riviera season.\nThe press expected the Match of the Century to be the start of a long rivalry between Lenglen and Wills that would continue later in the Riviera season. Wills facilitated the possibility of another encounter by entering singles events each of the next five weeks. On the other hand, Lenglen had previously stated at the beginning of the season that she only intended to compete in singles at three tournaments on the Riviera, a statement she reaffirmed after Wills announced her intention to compete there. As she had already entered singles at both her home club in Nice and the Carlton Club the previous two weeks, Lenglen was expected to set up a potential rematch at her home club, which hosted the South of France Championships the week of 8–14 March. After Wills officially entered the singles event at the tournament, the club began constructing a secondary stand that could seat 10,000 in anticipation for the match.\nThe week after the Carlton Club tournament, Lenglen entered only the doubles event at Beaulieu. Before her first match, however, she had a nervous collapse while travelling to the tournament, still suffering from exhaustion from the previous week's events. She ultimately ended up playing just one match before withdrawing. Although she also withdrew from the main events at the Monte Carlo tournament in which was Wills was competing, she entered the smaller eight-player doubles draw at the tournament called the Beaumont Cup that was separate from the main doubles event. Lenglen won the Beaumont Cup with Vlasto, while Wills and Leslie Aeschlimann lost in the opposite semifinal largely due to Aeschlimann being ill.\nFollowing Monte Carlo, Lenglen unexpectedly did not enter another tournament until the Carlton Club's April edition when Wills had already left the Riviera, and did not play singles again on the Riviera.\nSignificance.\nBest player in the world.\nThe closeness of the first match combined with Wills's aggressive play challenged Lenglen's perceived invincibility and made the press and spectators think that Wills could defeat Lenglen in singles and establish herself as the better player and the best in the world.\nPress believed Wills and Lenglen were similar caliber players and that a rematch could go either way.\nWills also met Frederick Moody, her future husband, at the beginning of the trip."

        "title": "1917 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1917 Auckland Rugby League season was its 9th. Due to the large number of players now serving in the First World War it was agreed to relax transfer rules to allow players from stronger teams to join weaker teams to even the competition. It was noted how many men from various clubs had been killed in battle by the beginning of 1917. They were Cecil Walker, Doug Dawson, T Marshall (Grafton Athletic), Charles Savory, Frank McWhirter (Ponsonby United), Graham Cook (Ponsonby United), N Vause, Victor McCollum, Alf Gault, T Lambert, E Tiernan, F Stubbs, W. G. Handle (Ponsonby United), B Hart, Frederick Gladding, A Powley, Chas Mann (North Shore Albions), William Moeki, G Jones, W Harris, Sam Magee, S Greer (City Rovers), Alan Miller, Charles Sinton, and Leslie O'Leary (Sunnyside). City Rovers had 'sent' ninety men to war by this time and twenty-one had been wounded and five killed. The Sunnyside club had only nine members left and one of those who had gone to the war (William O'Shaughnessey) said that in the trenches he had made a list of league players from various clubs which totaled 120. All three of the Sunnyside secretaries had enlisted and the executive was also gone. Ponsonby had also had over eighty of its members join the war effort.\n \n \nThirty three teams entered the six grades. This was down on previous seasons due to the number of men who had gone to fight. In the senior grade there were still six teams entered, with five second grade teams, five third grade teams, nine fourth grade teams, six fifth grade teams, and four sixth grade teams. The season was notable for the fact that Otahuhu was forced to drop out of the first grade competition after round 4 as it struggled to field senior players. Grafton Athletic also fell by the way-side soon after for the same reason.\nPonsonby United won the first grade championship for the first time in their history. They also won the Roope Rooster trophy for the first time with a 12–6 win over City Rovers in the final. By winning both competitions they became the second Auckland senior club to win multiple trophies in the same season following on the footsteps of City Rovers who had won both titles the year prior.\nNews.\nPupuke club.\nOn May 17, 1917 the Pupuke rugby league club was granted affiliation with the Auckland Rugby League at their weekly management meeting. They entered a single team in the 3rd grade competition. The Observer newspaper reported that “Takapuna is the latest recruit to Northern Unionism. Forty-three lads there have formed a club to be known as the Pupuke Club. One team has been entered in the third grade competitions to play in all red jerseys”. In 1921 a club was formed in the same Takapuna area and played until 1925.\nRepresentative season.\nAt the season end rather than a strong representative program which had been a feature of earlier years several charity and exhibition matches were played instead. These included a match versus the victorious Auckland Rugby Union club champions Railway. The team in its entirety switched to the rugby league code. They played matches with Ponsonby United and City Rovers at the end of the season. The team would go on to struggle for numbers itself in 1918 before eventually amalgamating with Grafton Athletic.\nVictoria Park.\nIn 1916 the fence around Victoria Park had been removed by the council which made it very difficult to collect gate revenue. The league had however secured land which would be developed as Carlaw Park with the aim being to secure the ground and gain revenue from ticket sales in the future.\nFirst grade championship.\nThe 1st grade championship had been competing for the Myers Cup from 1910 to 1914 but after the beginning of the war the league decided to not award trophies though the grade competitions were still competed for as normal. Twenty three first grade season matches were played which was less than previous seasons but owing to the fact that both Otahuhu and Grafton Athletic were forced to drop out of the competition due to a lack of players as a result of so many leaving to join the war effort. After their Round 4 default to North Shore where only two Otahuhu players turned up they decided to amalgamate senior teams with Grafton. This was short lived however as Grafton themselves only lasted until Round 7 when they themselves defaulted a week later. Ponsonby United were crowned champions for the first time in their existence.\n1st Grade results.\nRound 6.\nThe matches played at Victoria Park were the 100th and 101st senior club games played at that venue stretching from 1909 to 1917. Though both kicked off at the same time so the honour of being the 100th is shared.\nRound 7.\nGrafton continued to struggle to put out a competitive team and played 3 men short against Newton.\nRound 8.\nThe unknown try for Ponsonby in their win over North Shore was described in the New Zealand Herald match report as “a fierce combined rally resulted in the pack taking the ball over for a try”. Grafton defaulted their match with City and this ended their season as they were unable to field a side for any further competitive matches.\nRound 10.\nOn 21 July Ponsonby played a match versus the Waterside Workers after both Otahuhu and Grafton had left the competition. Ponsonby won the match by 14 points to 3.\nRoope Rooster knockout competition.\nAfter both Otahuhu and Grafton Athletic had dropped out of the senior grade there were only 4 senior teams left. However the Waterside Workers formed a team and played a match versus Ponsonby during the season, and they also played in the first round of the Roope Rooster.\nFollowing the conclusion of the Roope Rooster competition on 25 August a benefit match was played between City Rovers and Newton Rangers at Victoria Park. It was won by City 31 points to 11. On 1 September City defeated Ponsonby in another exhibition match, described as “one of the fastest and most exciting matches this season” by 13 points to 12 at Victoria Park.\nTop try scorers and point scorers.\nThe following point scoring lists include both Senior Championship matches and the Roope Rooster competition.\nSenior exhibition and charity matches.\nChallenge Match.\nThe match saw 17 year old Maurice Wetherill debut for City. He would then go off to war and then after his return he played for City from 1917 to 1930, playing 130 matches for them. He would also play 39 games for Auckland and 20 for New Zealand. He also coached City Rovers in 1930, the Northland representative side in 1929, and then became a referee in the 1930s, going on to referee at international level.\nMackrell Memorial.\nOn 8 September a combined match was played between Ponsonby-Shore and Newton-City with the proceeds devoted to a memorial to the late William Mackrell. This was a premonition of the future with City and Newton several decades later actually combining clubs.\nGala match in the Auckland Domain.\nOn 15 September a gala day was held with Rugby League and Football (“Association”) played to raise money for the RSA. It was declared a success and 200 pounds was raised. The match was played between Ponsonby United who had won the league championship and a combined team from the remainder of the clubs in the senior grade (City Rovers, Newton Rangers, and North Shore Albions). The combined team won by 26 to 21. The day also featured a sprint race between 6 players from the senior teams. It was won by Nicholson of the North Shore Albions. A ‘house match’ was also played between Hobson Hotel and Thompson and Hill's which Hobson Hotel won by 23 points to 3.\nExhibition matches.\nCity and Ponsonby United played an exhibition match on 24 September at Victoria Park. The City club applied for permission to play Maurice Wetherill as he was playing for their 4th grade side. The league granted permission and he played in the five eight position and played well. He would later go on to play for Auckland and New Zealand and also become an international referee. On 29 September a very controversial cross code match was played between Railway (a combination of Marist Brothers Old Boys and City) who were the winners of the Auckland Rugby Union competition, and Ponsonby, the Auckland Rugby League club champions. The match was not sanctioned by the Auckland Rugby Union as Railway was also scheduled to play an annual charity rugby union match versus University on the same day. The Railway team playing the league code had “gone over to the Northern Union game”. They played a further match against City Rovers which they lost by 18 points to 6 before moving to the Auckland Rugby League full-time in 1918. They would eventually amalgamate with Grafton Athletic and in 1919 they would reform as the Marist Rugby League Old Boys club”. The Railway team included Ces Dacre who went on to play cricket and soccer for New Zealand. Jimmy (Sonny) Hing who switched to Marist and had a long involvement in rugby league including with the Point Chevalier club also played in the matches.\nLower grade competitions.\nThe newly formed Pupuke club entered a side in the third grade. They were based in the Takapuna area and wore red uniforms. Manukau, Remuera and Riverhead did not field teams in any grades in 1917. It was decided at the start of the season that no trophies would be awarded in any of the grades due to the effect of the war on the competition and in line with there being no representative football being played in the war years. On several occasions it was asked if they would reconsider awarding winning teams anything but they consistently stated that nothing would be awarded, including badges.\nThere were also house matches played. On August 4 Thompson and Hill defeated A. &amp; T. Burt 7-2.\nSecond grade.\nPonsonby won the grade. Otahuhu withdrew after 1 round following a 12-0 loss to Newton. Only 18 results were reported from 25 scheduled matches though in the 1949 Rugby League Annual it was stated that Ponsonby had won 8 from 9 matches with a for of 85 and against of 18. The June 23 matches were rained out so it is possible that they won 8 from 8 as they only had 8 scheduled matches in the newspaper draws.\nThird grade.\nNewton withdrew from the competition after 1 round, while Ponsonby withdrew after 3 rounds. City Rovers beat Northcote &amp; Birkenhead Ramblers in round 11, 5-3 to seal the championship. Of the 21 matches played only 12 scores were reported.\nFourth grade.\nCity won the fourth grade competition after going undefeated. Otahuhu (the runner up did manage a 3-3 draw with them however. City won the majority of their matches without conceding any points (19-0, 26-0, 42-0, 68-0, 35-0, 3-3, 13-5, 33-0, 10-0, 25-0, 8-0, and 33-0). Thames Old Boys were awarded their round one match after Sunnyside fielded an overweight player. The match had finished in a 0-0 draw. North Shore withdrew after failing to field a side in round 1 and have not been included in the standings. Ponsonby withdrew after defaulting in round 10. There were only 26 scores reported, with 26 scores not reported.\nFifth grade.\nNorth Shore Albions won the championship. Only 12 match results were reported with 21 results not reported. Otahuhu only had 4 of their results reported but were said to have finished runner up, not 3rd.\nSixth grade.\nNorth Shore won the championship. There were 16 results reported and 5 were not reported.\nRepresentative fixture.\nAuckland played a match against a Military Representative side representing the Trentham, Featherston, and Tauherenikau camps at the Auckland Domain on 13 October.

After making their List A debut in the 1967 Gillette Cup the county played six matches in the competition up to 1973 and then once in 1977. Minor counties were not a regular feature of List A competitions and Bedfordshire played ten matches in the NatWest Trophy between 1982 and 2000 before playing ten matches in the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy between 2001 and 2005.\nThe knock-out nature of the Gillette Cup means that in most competitions Bedfordshire only played one match, most often against a first-class county. They won eight matches during the time they competed in List A competitions: the first win coming in their second match in 1968. On three occasions the county reached the third round of a List A competition in 1999, 2001 and 2003, beating other Minor Counties or Cricket Boards, as well as the Netherlands in 2002.\nPlayers are listed alphabetically with the number of matches played and the calendar years in which they made their first and last appearances in List A cricket for Bedfordshire. Most players also made appearances for Bedfordshire in the Minor Counties Championship and some will have represented other sides in top-class cricket. Only their appearances for Bedfordshire are included below."

        "title": "International Swimming League",
        "text": "The International Swimming League (ISL) is an annual professional swimming league, established in 2019. It features a team-based competition format with fast-paced race sessions. In 2019, the regular season started in October and the Final Match was held in December.\nAthletes with a history of breaking anti-doping rules are banned from ISL.\nIn March 2022, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the ISL abruptly cancelled its fourth season and all competition in 2022.\nHistory.\nFINA-ISL dispute.\nAt the start of the 2018 season, the only major annual swimming tournament sanctioned by FINA was FINA Swimming World Cup.\nInternational Swimming League, a team-based professional swimming series, was founded in 2017 by Russian-Ukrainian billionaire Konstantin Grigorishin.&lt;ref name=\"19/making-a-splash\"&gt;Making a splash: new big-money competition shakes up swimming, The Guardian (18 June 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; ISL planned to hold an inaugural event in Turin, Italy, in December, 2018. In June, 2018, FINA sent a letter to all 209 federations, urging them not to cooperate with ISL.\nAfter clarifying the interpretation of a rule included in section 4.5 of FINA general rules, FINA stated that the \"Energy for Swim\" meet was now classified as an international event for that season, given that \"a competition which is conceptually designed to have a majority of foreign participants is not a national competition\", and thus it needed to be approved within the ordinary six-month window.\nSince the approval window was already expired, the athletes participating in that meet would have been disqualified from one to two years by FINA and any world records set during the event would not have been recognized.\nThe negotiations between the parties officially broke down on 15 November 2018 after athletes decided that it would not be worth swimming at FINA sectioned meets if FINA was barring athletes from competing in the ISL. Eventually leading to \"Energy for Swim\" meet cancellation.\nDebut.\nDespite negotiations failure between FINA, ISL and Energy Standard Group - that would have organized \"Energy for Swim\" meet along with FIN - several athletes sustained the new idea of a team-based swimming competition (among which Katinka Hosszú and Adam Peaty). FINA announced in December 2018 the creation of a brand new league, called FINA Champions Swim Series.\nThe first ISL team to be officially announced was German side \"ONEFlow Aquatics\" (which would not have taken part to the inaugural season, eventually) in January 2019, after which ISL announced also the remaining three European teams and the four American teams in the following months.&lt;br&gt;\nMeanwhile, ISL also presented a newly formed representation company - ISL USA - which would have staged the semifinals and Final Match, at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, and assisted the new US clubs in their operations (including scouting talent, signing athletes and running their own swimming meets). A crucial step towards the creation of ISL was made when FINA announced that athletes taking part in Non-FINA sanctioned events would not have been banned and that similar competitions would be allowed, also confirming that all the world records set in the first two stages would not have been considered (because of clashing with World Cup events).&lt;br&gt;\nIn June 2019, ISL released the schedule of the league inaugural season, which officially started on the first week of the following October.\nAthlete bans.\nFrom the beginning of the International Swimming League, the administrators established a policy of not allowing athletes with anti-doping rules violations or ethics violations to compete. For athlete bans due to anti-doping rules violations, the ISL relies on test results from the World Anti-Doping Agency to implement the bans. In March 2022, the ISL approved the ban of all Russian swimmers and staff from the Energy Standard swim club as a way of punishing Russians in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and demonstrating its support for Ukraine.\nNon-payment boycotts.\nIn October 2021, following the repeated non-payment of multiple contractors, staff, and athletes, a number of athletes proposed boycotting the 2021 ISL playoffs. Leading up to the 2021 playoffs, the League's breaking of their contractual obligation to pay their workers and performers dated back at least to the 2020 ISL season, where multiple athletes were not paid for the entire season. In addition to non-payment of athletes and other workers, the ISL had already established a history of non-payment with competition venues, suppliers, and vendors across various locations, including the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Hungary, that dated back to season one in 2019.\nInvasion of Ukraine and cancellation.\nWith the vast majority of the ISL's $20 million annual funding coming from Ukrainian billionaire and businessman Konstantin Grigorishin, the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine has caused the league to struggle even further in its finances. On 28 February, just days after the Russian invasion began, the ISL failed to pay its athletes due to being unable to remove funds from within Ukraine. On 27 March 2022, the ISL released a statement with the decision to cancel its 4th season of 2022, slated to start in July with a planned 24 competitions and $13 million prize pool for athletes. The statement makes no mention of funding, though explicitly states support for the Ukrainian effort.\nFormat.\nISL Season.\nThe season is split into a regular championship and a final. In the regular championship clubs earn points from participating in matches according to the following principles: 4 points for 1st place in the match, 3 for 2nd, 2 for 3rd and 1 for 4th. After all of the championship matches, the 4 clubs with the highest number of points advance to the final, where the winner of the league (the ISL Champions) are determined. Each club can have a maximum roster of 32 athletes. At each match 28 of these are permitted to compete - 12 men and 12 women can swim individual races, while 2 men and 2 women can be used as \"relay only\" athletes.\nISL Matches.\nFour clubs take part in a match, an ISL match lasts two days. During the first season, an ISL match consisted of 37(39 in the 2020 season) races: 30(32) individual, 5 team relays and 2 skin races. Each race consists of 2 representatives from each of the clubs. Points are distributed after the race in the following manner: 9 points for 1st, 7 for 2nd, ... 1 for 8th. Points are not awarded to athletes (teams) that fail to finish a race. In addition, points are doubled in relays and are awarded after each of the 3 skin race heats.\nThe points of the clubs’ representatives are then added together and go towards the total points result of their respective clubs.\nA victory in a race does not guarantee maximum club points. As an example, club representatives that finish 1st and 7th in a race will earn less points for their respective clubs than those who finish 2nd and 4th: they will score 11 and 12 total points, respectively.\nA match is won by the club that has scored the most points in all of the 37 races. Similarly, the rest of the clubs are distributed through 2nd to 4th place, respective of the points they score during the entire match. Theoretically, a match could be won by a team that has not won a single race.\nIn the eventuality two or more clubs end up with the same number of points after the match, an extra mixed medley 4x50m relay shall take place, the outcome of which will mirror the final results of the match.\nTeams.\nThe 2019 season debuted with eight clubs in total, four from the United States, and four from Europe. In 2020 clubs from Canada and Japan were added to the league, increasing the total number of clubs to 10.\nDraft Process (2021).\nISL 2021 Season became the first season in which ISL used a draft to determine rosters.The ISL Draft is designed to achieve three major objectives:\nIn 2021, this process followed the steps below:\nThe final result of the 2021 ISL Draft can be found here and here.\nTechnical Rules.\nAll the matches are composed of four clubs. and take place on two days, with two two-hour long sessions including two short breaks in each. Each club is composed of a minimum of 24 and a maximum of 28 athletes, 12 Men and 12 Women are permitted to swim individual events while an additional 2 male &amp; 2 female athletes may be included in a Team roster as Relay only swimmers. In each event, all the clubs competing must line up two athletes (and also two teams in the relays).\nA standard ISL match takes place during two days. Each day consists of three 30-35 minute sessions, divided by two 10 minute breaks. Each day two adjacent lanes are randomly assigned to each club where the swimmers shall race in the lanes until the end of each competition day. On Day 1 if a club has been assigned outside lanes (7&amp;8 or 1&amp;2), the next day the club shall be guaranteed central lanes (3&amp;4 or 5&amp;6) and vice versa.\nTeam line-ups are submitted prior to each competition session. These line-ups can be changed and adjusted during the scheduled, the teams will be allowed to submit changes twice during the day at certain moments when the organization will allow this (before each break).\nA match consists of 39 races, including 32 individual events, 5 Relays and 2 Skin races, which are open only for the 12 swimmers that have participated in individual events. In addition, if two or more clubs tie in points at the end of the match, an additional mixed medley 4x50 relay shall take place between these clubs’ representatives. All athletes are allowed to participate in this relay. The winner of this relay shall stand higher in the final match rankings than the other club that swam in the relay.\n&lt;br&gt;\nPoints are awarded to the teams at the end of each match as follows.\nIn 2019, the two American and European teams with the highest number of points after the regular championship, qualify for the Final. If two or more clubs are tied after the regular championship, additional criteria are used to determine the winner.\nThe scoring for each individual event is as follows (relays races score double the points):\nRelay races.\nA particular points scoring system has been introduced for relay races, which score double points than individual events. In order to force athletes to put their best forward every time they step on the blocks and to avoid a lack of engagement, minimum time standards have been established.\nJackpot Times (2020 season).\nSource:\nIf an athlete is ahead of some athletes in their race by a margin bigger than the jackpot time, the points of these athletes are awarded to the club of the winner of the race. Theoretically, the winner of the race that out touches all of his opponents by more than the jackpot time (full jackpot) can earn 37 points for his club in an individual race (individual full jackpot), 74 points in a relay (relay full jackpot) and 85 points in a skin race, if he manages to win all three stages by more than the jackpot time (triple full jackpot). For example, if the winner for men's 100m freestyle swims 45.00, while the second place swims 47.00, the winner of the race wins full jackpot, since the difference between the leader of the race and the rest of the field was more than the jackpot time margin. Thus, the winner of 100m freestyle would earn 37 points for his team, while the rest of the athletes in the race would earn 0 points. In the case of a full jackpot, all three other teams receive 0 points for the race. In case an athlete fails to show up for a race or gets disqualified, the winner of the race will be awarded with his/her points and that swimmer will receive a penalty according to the \"penalties\" table. The jackpot times are seen in the table below:\nPenalties (2019 season).\nIf a relay or swimmer is slower than the times indicated in the table below, it gets a penalty of points. A relay slower than the time standard gets 2 points deducted whereas an individual athlete slower than the respective time indicated gets instead 1 point of penalty.\nOn the table all of the minimum time standards (SCM) for the events are compared to the world records.\nPenalties (2020).\nIf an athlete (or a relay team) is disqualified or does not finish the race, points are not awarded for his club, while two points (four for relay teams) are subtracted from the club's overall performance. If an athlete (or a relay team) did not appear for a race, points are not awarded for his club, while four points (eight for relay teams) are subtracted from the club's overall performance. In both cases, the disqualified athlete and the athlete that did not show up, it is considered that those athletes finished the race last, while the points those swimmers received for getting last in a race are awarded to the winner of that race.\nMVP.\nA Most Valuable Player (MVP) is determined after each match and at the end of the entire ISL season.\nThe criteria for an MVP is the number of points the swimmer has accumulated towards the overall team score for\nAfter each match, only one MVP is selected out of all participating swimmers in that specific match (Match MVP).\nAt the conclusion of the season one MVP is chosen from all the swimmers who took part in that particular season of ISL (Season MVP).\nSkins Race.\nA skin race is a series of back-to-back-to-back 50 meters (SCM) races of various strokes (Backstroke, Breaststroke, Butterfly or Freestyle) operating on a knockout basis: In the first round four swimmers are eliminated (out of 8), second round two swimmers are eliminated leaving the 3rd and last round consisting of only two swimmers racing each other in a head-to-head final race. Skin races’ rounds are held every 3 minutes. The athletes can warm down in the pool or can get a short massage from their team's physiotherapist behind the blocks between each round. The athletes knocked out of the race must return to their team's area. In Round 3, if a swimmer is disqualified (DSQ), he/she still receives the points he/she accumulated in rounds 1 and 2; and, if both swimmers are DSQ, they will then race again, in order to determine the winner of the round - the race will again be conducted on 3’.\nThe lanes, that the qualified athletes will use in the following round, are to be determined according to their team's lane assignment for the day. ISL skin races score as follows: \nBudget.\nThe 2019 season budget was US$20m, with over US$6m of this being appearance and prize money for the athletes.\nISL Records.\nAll results can be found at ISL official website."

Fencing was done to 15 touches or to the completion of three three-minute rounds if neither fencer reached 15 touches by then. At the end of time, the higher-scoring fencer was the winner; a tie resulted in an additional one-minute sudden-death time period. This sudden-death period was further modified by the selection of a draw-winner beforehand; if neither fencer scored a touch during the minute, the predetermined draw-winner won the bout.\nResults.\nThe following are the results of the event. \nQualification.\nAll 18 fencers were put into three groups of six athletes, were each fencer would have five individual matches. The top 14 athletes overall would qualify for next round."

        "text": "The Northern Arizona Lumberjacks men's ice hockey team is a college ice hockey program that represents Northern Arizona University. They are a member of the American Collegiate Hockey Association at the Division II, West Coast Hockey Conference and Division III, Independent. The university sponsored NCAA Division I ice hockey from 1981 to 1986.\nHistory.\nNAU founded its ice hockey program with the help of ACHA Hall of Fame Coach Gerald Caple in 1971 after the completion of the Flagstaff Ice Rink. A native of International Falls, Minnesota, Dr. Caple established the Lumberjack club hockey program in Flagstaff, Arizona while teaching at NAU as a chemistry professor. For more than a decade, Dr. Caple organized, advised, managed and coached the fledgling NAU hockey team, spending countless hours and untold amounts of money in order to develop and build the 'Jacks into a highly competitive collegiate hockey program. With the popularity of the club increasing, the team moved into the much larger Walkup Skydome in 1977 and, with continued interest, the university began sponsoring the program as a Division I sport in 1981. Northern Arizona was handicapped with a difficult travel schedule but the school was still supportive of their fledgling program and the Lumberjacks made strides, improving by 11 wins in their second year. Head coach Jimmy Peters Jr. got the team up to 21 wins before leaving the program in 1984 and was replaced by John Mason. In 1985 Northern Arizona joined with Alaska–Anchorage, Alaska–Fairbanks and U.S. International to form the Great West Hockey Conference. NAU finished 3rd in the conference but had several problems: the Walkup Skydome was in need of serious and expensive repair, the state had cut the university's budget for the next fiscal cycle and NAU was required to meet Title IX guidelines. With all of those issues the university suspended the program and ended the Lumberjacks time in D-I hockey.\nAfter several years of nonexistence the program was brought back in 1991 as a club sport and returned to the Flagstaff Ice Rink (since renamed the Jay Lively Activity Center) where it continues as two separate ACHA teams.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:"

        "title": "Yuri Korolev (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Yuri Vasilyevich Korolev (; born 6 June 1934) is a Russian ice hockey administrator, and retired coach and civil servant.\nHis career of educating athletes and coaches included the State Committee for Sports and Physical Education and the All-Union Council on Physical Culture and Sports. He was head of the research group for the Soviet Union national ice hockey team for 28 years, when the Soviets won seventeen Ice Hockey World Championships and seven Winter Olympic Games gold medals. He later served an executive with the Ice Hockey Federation of Russia and the International Ice Hockey Federation. \nKorolev has been recognized with the Order of Friendship, induction into the Russian Hockey Hall of Fame, and the Paul Loicq Award.\nEarly life.\nKorolev was born 6 June 1934, in Moscow, Soviet Union. He dreamed of being an ice hockey player but lacked the necessary skills. He chose to end his playing career by age 20 and transition to coaching.\nCareer.\nKorolev joined the State Committee for Sports and Physical Education in 1954, and began a career of educating athletes and coaches. From 1962 to 1974, he lectured at the State Committee for Sports and Physical Education and became its senior lecturer. He served as the head of the hockey department at the State Committee for Sports and Physical Education from 1974 to 1983, and was the head teacher of its school of hockey coaches. From 1983 to 1989, he was the head coach of the football and ice hockey committee of the All-Union Council on Physical Culture and Sports, and was the deputy of the council from 1987 to 1988.\nKorolev was also connected to both the Soviet Union national ice hockey team and the Soviet Union national junior ice hockey team. From 1964 to 1992, he was head of the research group for the national men's team, and contributed to the team winning seventeen Ice Hockey World Championships and seven Winter Olympic Games gold medals. At the end of his tenure, he was head coach of the national team from 1990 and 1992. At the 1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, the Soviet juniors had a bench-clearing brawl versus the Canadian juniors, that later became known as the Punch-up in Piestany. Korolev expressed regret that the incident occurred but did not admit any guilt. He felt that the game should have been finished instead of both teams being disqualified from the tournament. During ice hockey at the 1990 Goodwill Games, Korolev spoke out against Sergei Fedorov leaving the Soviet national team and signing a five-year contract with the Detroit Red Wings. Korolev insisted that his player was stolen by premeditated actions and, rather than defecting on his own \"under normal circumstances\". He said that \"having this happen on the eve of the goodwill games, is like a spoon of tar in a barrel of honey\".\nKorolev retired from coaching then served as vice-president of the Ice Hockey Federation of Russia from 1992 to 2001, and as its secretary general from 2001 to 2003. He also represented Russia at international meetings, and was elected to the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) Council in 1992. He served for six years until 1998 as the chairman of its coaching committee. \nKorolev has served as a director of the hockey department at the International Scientific and Methodological Center since May 2003.\nHonors.\nKorolev was made a recipient of the Order of Friendship by the Russian Federation on 20 December 1996. He was named an honorary life member of the IIHF in 1998. He was elected to the Russian and Soviet Hockey Hall of Fame in 2004. He received the Paul Loicq Award during the 2011 IIHF World Championship, for recognition of his contributions to the IIHF and international ice hockey."

The final was contested by the Warrington Wolves and St Helens, the first time the two sides have met in a major final.\nBackground.\nThe two sides have never met in a Challenge Cup final before. It had been 11 years since St Helens last won in the Challenge Cup Final, and despite final appearances in 2016 and 2018, Warrington have not triumphed since 2012.\nWarrington came into the game on the back of five straight defeats in Super League, and with being defeated by the Catalans Dragons in last season's final. On the other hand, the Saints were leading the way at the top of the table, losing just three games all season, 2\ntwo of which came at the London Broncos (one of those games going to golden point extra time), with the other, away to Catalans. They had not lost a home game so far in the season.\nRoute to the final.\nWarrington Wolves.\nWarrington escaped the sixth round with a narrow 26–24 victory over rivals Wigan. Warrington then faced Hull KR in the quarter finals winning 28 points to 22. Warrington's semi-final opposition was also a Kingston-upon-Hull side, this time Hull F.C., to which they secured their most comfortable win en route to the final.\nSt Helens.\nSt Helens faced Super League side Huddersfield Giants in the sixth round, beating them 22–16. A 48–10 thrashing of Wakefield Trinity in the quarter finals saw the Saints progress to the semis where they faced Championship side Halifax and getting a comfortable victory to progress to the final."

Junior national teams from Czech Republic, Israel, and the United States along with German club Deutschland Adler rounded out the field. Canada West won the gold medal game while Iroquois West captured the bronze medal.\n\"International Indoor Junior Lacrosse\" purchased the rights to the tournament in 2016 and it was rebranded to its current name the IIJL World Junior Lacrosse Championship. Eight teams would compete in the second edition which was again held at Iroquois Lacrosse Arena. Czech Republic and United States returned along with newcomer Ireland.

Baseball steaks differ from sirloin steaks in that the bone and the tenderloin and bottom round muscles have been removed; and the cut is taken from biceps femoris. A baseball steak is essentially a center cut top sirloin cap steak. This cut of beef is very lean, and is considered very flavorful.\nThe USDA NAMP / IMPS codes related to this subprimal cut are 181A and 184. 181A is obtained from 181 after removing the bottom sirloin and the butt tender (the part of the tenderloin which is in the sirloin). 184 is obtained from 182 after removing the bottom sirloin. The foodservice cuts from 184 are 184A through 184F, its portion cut is 1184 and, the \"subportion\" cuts from 1184 are 1184A through 1184F. 181A is not further divided into foodservice cuts. Baseball steaks are made primarily from cut 184F. In Australia, this cut is called D-rump in the Handbook of Australian Meat and assigned code 2100.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"baseball steak\" refers to the shape of the steak following cooking, since a baseball steak is essentially a center cut top sirloin. After it has been cooked, the center domes and swells and forms a rounded shape similar to a baseball.\nCooking styles.\nBaseball steak is usually served grilled, broiled, sautéed, or pan fried.\nNutrition.\nA baseball steak per ounce contains 57 calories, 3 grams of fat, and 6 grams of protein. Like other red meats it also contains iron, creatine, minerals such as zinc and phosphorus, and B-vitamins: (niacin, vitamin B12, thiamin, riboflavin), and lipoic acid."

Nelvis hit the ninth hurdle and lost her step, listing to the left going into the final barrier.

On the run for home, Taplin and defending champion Luguelín Santos went out the back. Gaye continue to hold the edge as the others struggled.

The coins were authorized by Public Law 115–343 to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nHistory.\nFollowing the success of the National Baseball Hall of Fame commemorative coins of 2014, H.R.4592 was introduced to the House of Representatives in 2016. It proposed the production of a series of coins commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2019. However, it did not make it past the House.\nThe production of Basketball Hall of Fame coins was proposed again in 2017 with H.R.1235, this time with production scheduled for 2020. Unlike the previous proposal, H.R.1235 passed the House and the Senate, and was signed into law by President Donald Trump on December 21, 2018, becoming Public Law 115–343.\nLegislation.\nPublic Law 115–343 calls for a maximum mintage limit of 750,000 clad half dollars, 400,000 silver dollars, and 50,000 gold half eagles. It also calls for the coins to be dome-shaped and for the reverse to feature a basketball.\nDesigns.\nThe US Mint launched the Basketball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Design Competition on March 19, 2019, calling for artists to submit obverse designs to the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. The chosen designs were unveiled on September 6, 2019.\nThe obverse, designed by Justin Kunz, will feature three players reaching for a ball. The reverse, designed by Donna Weaver, will feature a basketball falling into a net.\nSome of the designs not chosen for the Basketball Hall of Fame coins were later submitted to the CCAC for the reverse of the 2020 Massachusetts American Innovation dollar.\nColorization.\nOn July 17, 2019, April Stafford, the chief of the Office of Design Management, stated that the Mint was considering colorizing the half dollar and silver dollar coins. The Mint confirmed later that year that those coins would be colorized, becoming the first such coins released from the Mint.\nThe idea of colorized coins brought mixed responses from the numismatic community. One reader of \"Coin World\" opined negatively that the Mint would be mimicking the Royal Canadian Mint's \"plan of turning out trinkets\". However, some welcomed the prospect of coloring."

There were 37 players and supporters present. Mr. D. W. MacLean chaired the meeting. 21 players enrolled at the new club. Mr Lepper was appointed hon secretary, and Mr A. Jackson treasurer. The club was initially to be called the Northcote Warriors however within a week this was changed to the Northcote Ramblers which they were known as for decades afterwards. Today the club is known as the Northcote Tigers. The team played their first ever match on 23 April when they took on a combined Newton Rangers and Ponsonby United junior team in Northcote. The home team won by 18 points to 8 with Jack Stanaway refereeing.\nMyers Cup (First Grade Championship).\nSixteen matches were played until the final round on 20 August where City Rovers defeated Ponsonby United to become the inaugural champions of Auckland club Rugby League (which at this time was referred to as 'Northern Union' in the media). The Round 4 match between North Shore and City won by City 12–6 did not have the point scorers reported. In the Round 6 match between Ponsonby and City the match was abandoned after Albert Opai Asher led the City team off the field after protesting the non awarding of a 'try' to the City team. After an inquiry by the league during the week Asher apologised."

        "title": "1912 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1912 Auckland Rugby League season was the 4th official year of the Auckland Rugby League. The season commenced on 11 May, with the start of the First Grade competition.\nIt saw six teams competing for the First Grade title after the addition of the Manukau Rovers who were formed after a meeting in Onehunga in March. The season commenced on 11 May with the start of the first grade competition.\nNewton Rangers secured their first Auckland first grade club title after they defeated Ponsonby United in the penultimate round at Eden Park on 13 July.\n \n \nNews.\nManukau Magpies formed.\nManukau held a meeting in Onehunga in March. They decided to field a senior team and two junior teams. James Rukutai was their captain and after his death in 1940 the trophy for the minor premiers was named after him. Teams still play for it today.\nHobsonville Pirates.\nA club was formed in Hobsonville, West Auckland at the start of the season. They decided on the name of Hobsonville Pirates. They fielded a team in the second grade. They had the use of a paddock on Midgeley's farm for games and teams had to make their way there by launch from the city centre on Saturday mornings. They failed to field a side in 1913 and then in 1914 they fielded a side in the 3rd grade before folding at the end of the season.\nMyers Cup (First Grade Championship).\nThirty regular season matches were played with nearly all fixtures being played at Eden Park (25 in total). With the Devonport Domain being used for four North Shore Albions home matches, and one match at Ellerslie.\nMyers Cup results.\nRound 1.\nImages were published in the New Zealand Graphic of the City Rovers v North Shore Albions match. The very young Walter Jack Perry, better known as Jack Perry, debuted for Newton on the wing in their comfortable win over Eden. He played 18 games for Newton over the next 3 seasons before enlisting in the war effort. He died from wounds in France on July 10, 1916 aged 20.\nRound 2.\nIn the match between North Shore and Newton, Joe Bennett broke his leg and missed the rest of the season. He returned to captain the side at the start of the 1913 season.\n \nRound 3.\nCharles Webb debuted for Ponsonby after switching from the Ponsonby rugby union club. He scored a try in their 45-9 win over Eden. In the same game three other players scored multiple tries (Charles Savory 3, Sid Riley 2, and Arthur Carlaw 2) in addition to their other 4 try scorers. Both of the senior matches were played at Eden Park with 600 in attendance. The other match was played at the Devonport Domain with the home side, North Shore winning 5-3. For the defeated Manukau side their first ever New Zealand representative, Arthur Hardgrave scored their only points.\n \nRound 4.\nEden only had nine players for their match with North Shore and after trailing by 33 points to 0 they threw in the proverbial towel and the match ended at that point. No point scorers or match description was published in the NZ Herald or Auckland Star. In the match between Ponsonby and Newton Charles Savory was ordered from the field for “rough and tumble” play just before fulltime and a match his side won by 16 to 6. He had earlier scored 2 tries and kicked a conversion. The fullback for Newton was J. Perry who had debuted weeks earlier and was said to be playing well despite being in his early teens.\n \nRound 5.\nAfter a scuffle between C Clark (North Shore), and Charles Webb (Ponsonby) resulted in referee Matt Hooper sending Clark off. Eden upset City with a 10-6 win to register their first win of the year. City had taken the lead towards the end of the game and from the kickoff with one minute remaining A Innes \"took the ball up the field on his own\" to score the winning try which Don Kenealy converted. Billy Curran switched from rugby (Marist Old Boys) and debuted for Newton. Following the game he was chosen in the New Zealand team to meet Auckland. He went on to play 6 matches for New Zealand on their Australia tour and 6 times for Auckland before signing with Wigan. He ultimately only played the one club league match in New Zealand. During the following week the Auckland Rugby League passed a resolution that no player be selected for representative fixtures unless they had played at least 4 matches in the rugby league code.\n \nRound 6.\nThe rugby league code showed that it was still struggling in its infancy to always organise itself properly with City only managing to field 12 players and the Auckland Star noted in its match report that several players “wore wrongly coloured uniforms”, and that the match was scheduled for 3:15 but kicked off 30 minutes late. The field was in a very muddy state and played in heavy rain, and after halftime some of the players did not return to the field. Also noticeable was the Newton and Eden result where Newton ran in 12 tries but only managed to convert one of them. Goal kicking in general was relatively poor and was shared amongst the teams with it not uncommon to see 3 or 4 players used.\n \nRound 7.\n Archie Ferguson refereed his first ever first grade game. He would go on to referee 50 first grade games and 8 representative games before becoming a prominent administrator in both refereeing and managing, including the New Zealand team. George Hunt who scored a try for City would also go on to become an administrator for the Auckland Rugby League in the 1920s.\n \nRound 8.\nIt was reported that Arthur Francis the Newton player was now enroute to England where he was to join the Wigan club and play until 1919 when he would return to New Zealand and coach Newton in 1921. Charles Webb of the Ponsonby side was unable to play in their match with Eden after suffering from rheumatism. Remarkably little more than a month after being thrashed by Ponsonby by nearly 40 points, Eden managed to draw with them 9-9. John Henry Dufty made his debut for City. He had become famous for his remarkable kicking for the Thames rugby side in 1906 where he kicked 49 points in representative games sparking the cry \"Give It To Dufty\" at football grounds in New Zealand for many years to come. While he had really only had the one standout season he still kicked well at times.\n \nRound 9.\nNewton's win over Ponsonby effectively decided the title in their favour. Ponsonby had a weakened side with William Cossey, Sid Riley, and Charles Webb all unavailable but filled their places with Jack Stanaway and George Bater, a Ponsonby rugby player. Newton were without William Tobin but George Gillett was available and led the side to victory.\n \nRound 10.\nNewton were one point ahead of Ponsonby in the championship and needed a win to secure the title. Manukau scored first and Newton only had a 5-3 lead at halftime but in the second half they totally dominated, putting on 29 points to 0 for a 34-3 win. It gave them their maiden championship. Eden upset City 25-5 though City fielded a weak team and lost two players to injury during the match.\nTop scorers.\nThere were multiple instances of points being unattributed. As such the following try scoring and point scoring lists are incomplete. Games and/or teams with unattributed points are as follows: North Shore try and penalty v Manukau (R3), North Shore 33 points v Eden (R4), Newton 1 try v Manukau (R10), Eden 25 points v City (R10), City 5 points v Eden (R10). This amounts to 82 points unattributed out of 773 points scored in total. With the New Zealand team touring Australia several players only played a handful of matches before departing which limited their scoring opportunities to 4 games.\nLower grades and exhibition matches.\nSecond Grade.\nThe Points table at the end of the first round (which was published) and additional known results. Only 19 scores were reported therefore the points for and against are only tallies from those matches. The table also included the championship final which saw Ponsonby defeat Otahuhu 15-9.\nThird Grade.\nPonsonby B beat Ponsonby A in the final match 17-5 to win the competition. There were two rounds of matches played prior to the competition beginning. Only 8 rounds were played (7 matches for each team) and only 8 scores were reported, including none from Northcote's games. The standings were published after 7 rounds however which showed the teams wins and losses to that point. As a result the points for and against only includes those reported.\nFourth Grade.\nThe competition was played over 7 rounds. Only 16 match scores were reported out of 26 matches played. The for and against as a result are incomplete as are the win loss records.\nRepresentative season.\nThe team to play Thames-Goldfields to begin the season was a considerably weakened one. Several players named originally in the NZ Herald did not actually make the trip and the match day line up as reported in the Thames News was a very different one with many players on debut for Auckland.\nAuckland v New Zealand.\nSid Riley the former Australian rugby international who was playing club football in Auckland for Ponsonby at the time was listed to play for Auckland in the match. However he played for New Zealand instead. A photo was published of the Auckland team. They are from left to right Ernie Asher, George Seagar, Jim Griffen, ?, ?, Bob Mitchell, ?, ?, ?, ?, Harry Fricker, ?, and ?. Originally the Hayward brothers (Morgan and Harold) were named to play for New Zealand however with their Thames side playing the curtain-raiser they ultimately represented them on the day.\nAuckland v Hawke’s Bay (Northern Union C.C.).\nThe Auckland team featured Harold Hayward who was from the Thames district which was affiliated to Auckland Rugby League. He had been a member of the combined Thames-Goldfields team which had played Auckland earlier in the season.\nAuckland B v Hamilton.\nEarly in the game Skeats for Auckland broke \"several ribs\" and had to leave the field with a replacement coming on, most likely William Tobin as he was in the reserves and later scored a try. Then near the end of the match another Auckland player sprained a toe and left the field leaving Auckland a player short.\nAuckland v Rotorua.\nOn 3 August Auckland played Rotorua in Rotorua and they also played Lower Waikato at Eden Park. The later match was listed in some quarters as a B team though it was filled with New Zealand internationals.\nAuckland v Wellington (Northern Union C.C.).\nDue to the Rotorua and Thames leagues being affiliated with the Auckland Rugby League the Auckland team contained two players from each sub league. Namely Riki Papakura and Rukingi Reke from Rotorua and Harold Hayward and his brother Morgan Hayward from Thames.\nAuckland v New South Wales.\nAuckland won their first victory over an ‘international’ side when they defeated New South Wales by 10 points to 3. The game was marred by several acts of violence with the visiting side said to be at fault repeatedly. Near the end of the match Sid Deane was sent off for punching Billy Curran.\nAuckland v New South Wales.\nNew South Wales reversed their earlier loss with a comprehensive win over a disappointing Auckland effort. Charles Dunning and Bob Mitchell who had both been named to play originally were forced to withdraw due to illness and were replaced by Harry Fricker and Jim Griffin."

        "title": "Major League Baseball on television in the 1990s",
        "text": "On December 14, 1988, CBS (under the guidance of Commissioner Peter Ueberroth) paid approximately $1.8 billion for exclusive television rights for over four years (beginning in 1990). CBS paid about $265 million each year for the World Series, League Championship Series, All-Star Game, and the Saturday \"Game of the Week\". It was one of the largest agreements (to date) between the sport of baseball and the business of broadcasting.\nOn January 5, 1989, Major League Baseball signed a $400 million deal with ESPN, who would show over 175 games beginning in 1990. For the next four years, ESPN would televise six games a week (Sunday, \"Wednesday Night Baseball\", doubleheaders on Tuesdays and Fridays, plus holidays).\nThe deal with CBS was also supposed to pay each team $10 million a year. A separate deal with cable TV would bring each team an additional $4 million. Each team could also cut its own deal with local TV. For example, the New York Yankees signed with a cable network (MSG) that would pay the team $41 million annually for 12 years. Radio broadcast rights can bring in additional money. Reportedly, after the huge TV contracts with CBS and ESPN were signed, ballclubs spent their excess millions on free agents.\nIn the end, CBS wound up losing approximately half a billion dollars from their television contract with Major League Baseball. CBS repeatedly asked Major League Baseball for a rebate, but MLB wasn't willing to do this.\nYear-by-year breakdown.\n1990.\nAs previously mentioned, on January 5, 1989, Major League Baseball signed a $400 million deal with ESPN, who would show over 175 games beginning in 1990. For the next four years, ESPN would televise six games a week (\"Sunday Night Baseball\", \"Wednesday Night Baseball\" and doubleheaders on Tuesdays and Fridays), as well as multiple games on Opening Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Labor Day.\nOn April 15, 1990, ESPN's \"Sunday Night Baseball\" debuted with the experienced play-by-play announcer Jon Miller joining retired Hall of Fame player Joe Morgan in the broadcast booth. In its first year, \"Sunday Night Baseball\" averaged a 3.0 rating. That was double the number that ESPN as a whole was averaging at the time (1.5). By 1998, ESPN enjoyed its largest baseball audience ever (a 9.5 Nielsen rating) as Mark McGwire hit his 61st home run of the season. When ESPN first broadcast \"Sunday Night Baseball\", they would show at least one game from every ballpark. Also, every team was guaranteed an appearance. It was essentially, the television equivalent to a cross country stadium tour.\nMeanwhile, Major League Baseball's four-season tenure with CBS (–) was marred by turmoil and shortcomings throughout. The original plan was for Brent Musburger to be the primary play-by-play announcer for CBS' baseball telecasts (thus, having the tasks of calling the All-Star Game, National League Championship Series and World Series), with veteran broadcaster and lead CBS Radio baseball voice Jack Buck to serve as the secondary announcer (which would involve calling a second weekly game and the American League Championship Series). Former ABC color commentator Tim McCarver was hired by CBS to be Musburger's partner while NBC's Jim Kaat was hired to be Buck's. However, weeks before CBS was to debut its MLB coverage, on April 1, 1990, Musburger was fired by the network over what CBS perceived to be a power grab by Musburger in taking on the assignment (at the time, Musburger was CBS' lead college basketball announcer, host of \"The NFL Today\", and was the main studio host for the NBA and had felt that he had been given too many broadcasting assignments by the network).\nWith Musburger's firing, Buck was moved up to the primary announcing team alongside McCarver. His position as backup announcer alongside Kaat was taken by CBS' lead NBA announcer, Dick Stockton. Studio host Greg Gumbel took over for Stockton as the secondary play-by-play announcer in . Gumbel was in return, replaced by Andrea Joyce, who served as a field reporter for the first three seasons of CBS' coverage. On the teaming of Buck and McCarver, \"Broadcasting\" magazine wrote \"The network has exclusivity, much rides on them.\" Joining the team of Buck and McCarver was Lesley Visser (who was, incidentally, married to the aforementioned Dick Stockton), became the first woman to cover the World Series in 1990.\nCBS initially did not want to start their 1990 coverage until after the network had aired that year's NBA Finals (which was the last time CBS aired the Finals before the NBA's move to NBC). Therefore, only 12 regular season telecasts were scheduled The broadcasts would have been each Saturday from June 16 through August 25 and a special Sunday telecast on the weekend of August 11–12 (the New York Yankees against the Oakland Athletics in Oakland on both days). Ultimately, four more telecasts were added – two in April and two on the last two Saturdays of the season.\nMeanwhile, Jim Kaat earned rave reviews for his role as CBS' backup analyst (which flashed a considerable \"good-guy air\"). Ron Bergman wrote of Kaat's performance during the 1990 ALCS, \"This was a night for pitchers to excel. Dave Stewart. Roger Clemens. Jim Kaat [on commentary].\" Despite the rave reviews, Jim Kaat admitted that he was frustrated. He felt that at that point and time, the idea of figuring out what to talk about during a three-hour broadcast had become intimidating. As a result, Kaat would bring notes into the booth, but in the process, found himself providing too much detail. He ultimately confided in his broadcasting partner, Dick Stockton, that he wanted to work without notes. So Stockton hooked Kaat up with then-lead \"NFL on CBS\" color commentator, John Madden for a telephone seminar. Madden said if he brought notes into the booth he felt compelled to use them and would \"force\" something into a telecast. On his seminar with John Madden, Jim Kaat said \"Then John told me if he did his homework it would be stored in his memory bank. And if it is important it will come out. If it doesn't, it probably wasn't that important.\"\nA mildly notorious moment came during CBS' coverage of the 1990 All-Star Game from Wrigley Field in Chicago. In a game that was marred by rain delays for a combined 85 minutes (including a 68-minute monsoon during the 7th inning), CBS annoyed many diehard fans by airing the William Shatner-hosted reality series \"Rescue 911\" during the delay.\nThe 1990 postseason started on a Thursday, while World Series started on a Tuesday due to the brief lockout. Major League Baseball and CBS went with some rather unconventional scheduling during the LCS round, with two consecutive scheduled off-days in the NLCS after Game 2.\nAfter NBC lost the Major League Baseball package to CBS, the network aggressively counterprogrammed CBS' postseason baseball coverage with made-for-TV movies and miniseries geared towards female viewers.\nCBS' first year of Major League Baseball postseason coverage in general, proved to be problematic for the network. First and foremost, none of the teams involved in the ALCS (Boston and Oakland), NLCS (Cincinnati and Pittsburgh), and World Series (Cincinnati and Oakland) involved teams from baseball's largest media markets. This more than likely, helped reduce playoff ratings by 9.4% for prime time games and 3.4% for weekend daytime games. This was below the levels of the playoffs the year before, when they aired on NBC.\nWhile the ratings for the 1990 World Series improved to 26.2 compared to 1989, the 1989 Series (which aired on ABC) was interrupted for 10 days by the Loma Prieta earthquake. All in all, the 1989 World Series was at the time, the lowest rated World Series ever. More to the point, the ratings for the 1990 World Series on CBS were significantly lower than any World Series between 1982 and 1988.\nAlthough the 1990 NLCS lasted six games, that year's ALCS and more importantly, the World Series, lasted only four out of seven possible games. To put things into proper perspective, by one estimate, CBS lost $5 million for each playoff game not played and US$15.4 million for each World Series game not played. At the end of the day, CBS lost $12 million to $15 million on each of the League Championship Series and World Series games not played, for a total of $36 million to $45 million.\n1991.\nAfter sustaining huge losses (CBS claimed to have lost about $55 million in after-taxes revenue in 1990, which would go up to $170 million at the end of its four-year contract) from 1990's abbreviated postseason (which ended with the Cincinnati Reds shockingly sweeping the defending World Champion Oakland Athletics in the World Series), CBS made several notable adjustments for 1991. Regular season telecasts were reduced to a meager handful. In return, pregame shows during the League Championship Series were entirely eliminated, to minimize the ratings damage.\nFor CBS' coverage of the 1991 All-Star Game from Toronto, CBS started their broadcast at the top of the hour with the customary pregame coverage. And then, because American President George H.W. Bush and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney were throwing out the first ball, there was a slight delay from the 8:30 p.m. EDT start. The game eventually started about 15–20 minutes late. Presumably this, along with CBS' low ratings for baseball, and the costs of doing pregame coverage, led to them starting the prime time broadcasts at 8:30 for the final two years of the contract, with little or no pregame content.\nThe 1991 season was perhaps most noteworthy for CBS having the opportunity to cover the now legendary World Series between the Minnesota Twins and Atlanta Braves. The tightly contested, seven-game affair between Minnesota and Atlanta earned CBS the highest ratings for a World Series since the 1986 World Series between the New York Mets and Boston Red Sox on NBC.\nEarlier in the postseason, CBS' coverage of the ALCS meant that they could not carry the live testimony of Clarence Thomas, whose confirmation to the United States Supreme Court was put into question because of charges of sexual harassment from former staffer Anita Hill. Meanwhile, ABC, NBC, CNN and PBS all carried the testimony.\nAs previously mentioned, as CBS' baseball coverage progressed, the network dropped its 8:00 p.m. pregame coverage (in favor of airing sitcoms such as \"Evening Shade\"), before finally starting their coverage at 8:30 p.m. Eastern Time. The first pitch would generally arrive at approximately 8:45 p.m. Perhaps as a result, Joe Carter's World Series clinching home run off Mitch Williams in 1993, occurred at 12:00 a.m. on the East Coast.\nAfter two years of calling baseball telecasts for CBS, Jack Buck was dismissed in December 1991. According to the radio veteran Buck, he had a hard time adjusting to the demands of a more constricting television production. CBS felt that Buck should have done more to make himself appear to be a set-up man for lead analyst Tim McCarver. Jack Buck's son Joe tried to rationalize his father's on-air problems by saying \"My dad was brought up in the golden age of radio, I think he had his hands tied somewhat, being accustomed to the freedom of radio. I'm more used to acquiescing to what the producer wants to do, what the director wants to do.\"\nBuck himself sized up CBS' handling of the announcers by saying \"CBS never got that baseball play-by-play draws word-pictures. All they knew was that football stars analysts. So they said, 'Let [analyst Tim] McCarver run the show.' In television, all they want you to do is shut up. I'm not very good at shutting up.\" Buck though, would add that although he knew Tim McCarver well, they never developed a good relationship with each other on the air despite high hopes to the contrary. Phil Mushnick added insult to injury to Buck by accusing him of \"trying to predict plays, as if to prove he was still on top.\"\nBuck also got into deep trouble with CBS executives (namely executive producer Ted Shaker) over questionable comments made towards singer Bobby Vinton in 1990. While on-air prior to Game 4 of that year's NLCS in Pittsburgh, Buck criticized Vinton's off-key rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", making a comment towards Vinton that sounded like a prejudicial remark centered on his Polish heritage. Joe Buck believed that the situation was ironic because his father was \"trying to help the guy.\" Buck began receiving death threats from Pirate fans and discovered a footprint on his pillow once he returned to his hotel room.\n1992.\nJack Buck's replacement was Boston Red Sox announcer Sean McDonough. Ted Shaker called McDonough about his interests for the top announcing job, and after McDonough hung up the telephone, he claimed that he did not want to \"act like a 10-year-old\" but he \"jumped so high that he put a hole in his ceiling.\" McDonough, who was 30 years old at the time, became the youngest full-time network announcer to call a World Series when he called that year's Fall Classic alongside McCarver.\nFor CBS' coverage of the 1992 All-Star Game, they introduced Basecam, a lipstick-size camera, inside first base. The 1992 All-Star Game on CBS was also interrupted with coverage of the Democratic National Convention.\nOver the course of Game 2 of the 1992 ALCS, Jim Kaat was stricken with a bad case of laryngitis. As a result, Johnny Bench had to come over from the CBS Radio booth and finish the game with Dick Stockton as a \"relief analyst.\" There was talk that if Kaat's laryngitis did not get better, Don Drysdale was going to replace Kaat on television for Game 3, while Bench would continue to work on CBS Radio.\nTim McCarver ran afoul of Atlanta Braves outfielder Deion Sanders during the 1992 postseason, when he made comments on-air criticizing Sanders for his two-sport athletic career; Sanders was playing for both the Braves and the NFL's Atlanta Falcons at the time and participated in both the baseball postseason and the early NFL regular season for the first time in 1992 (Sanders was unable to do this in 1991, as his NFL contract with the Falcons would not allow him to). Sanders retaliated following Game 7 of the NLCS by dumping a bucket of ice water on McCarver (who was wired for sound and feared electrocution).\nMcCarver was not immune to criticism from outside sources, either, as Norman Chad wrote a critique of him in \"Sports Illustrated\" during the postseason. Chad said that McCarver was someone who \"when you ask him the time, will tell you how a watch works\", a reference to McCarver's perceived tendency to overanalyze things. Chad went further by saying \"What's the difference between Tim McCarver and appendicitis? Appendicitis is covered by most health plans.\"\nMcCarver was also known to make gaffes from time to time. One of his more amusing miscues came during the 1992 National League Championship Series when he repeatedly referred to Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Tim Wakefield as \"Bill Wakefield.\" He finally explained that Bill Wakefield was one of his old minor-league teammates, and he laughed at himself because \"I forgot my own name!\" The year prior, during Game 6 of the World Series, McCarver's broadcast colleague, Jack Buck talked about Atlanta third baseman Terry Pendleton, who hit .367 in the series. Buck said, \"TP. That's what his teammates call him.\" A few seconds later, McCarver rather oddly added, \"TP. An appropriate name for someone who plays on the Braves.\"\nDuring the 1992 postseason, CBS missed covering one of the three debates among U.S. presidential candidates George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and H. Ross Perot. The network had planned to join other broadcast and cable networks in the telecast; however, Game 4 of the ALCS between the Toronto Blue Jays and Oakland Athletics did not end until 8:30 p.m. Eastern Time, about the time the debate ended. The Blue Jays won the game 7-6 in 11 innings. The other networks reported very good ratings for the debate, part of one of the more compelling election campaigns in recent times.\n1993.\nLesley Visser missed the first half of the 1993 season due to injuries earlier suffered in a bizarre jogging accident in New York City's Central Park. Visser broke her hip and skidded face-first across the pavement, requiring reconstructive plastic surgery on her face and more than a decade later required an artificial hip replacement. She missed the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Jim Kaat would replace her while she recuperated. Jim Gray also served as a reporter for the All-Star Game and World Series.\nFor 1993, CBS made a broadcast booth change by removing Dick Stockton from his role as secondary play-by-play announcer after three seasons, and replacing him with Greg Gumbel. As previously mentioned, also during the 1993 season, Andrea Joyce replaced Gumbel as studio host. Joyce would be joined at the anchor desk by Pat O'Brien. At the 1993 World Series, she became the first woman to co-host the network television coverage for a World Series. Sean McDonough filled in for O'Brien, who was suffering from laryngitis, as the pregame host for Game 6 of the 1993 National League Championship Series. Game 6 of the NLCS by the way, didn't have its first pitch until nearly 8:50 p.m. EST so that CBS could run \"60 Minutes\" in its entirety.\nOn August 3, 1993, Gayle Gardner became the first woman to do television play-by-play for a Major League Baseball game. It was the Colorado Rockies vs. Cincinnati Reds on KWGN-TV in Denver.\nDuring CBS' coverage of the World Series, umpires were upset with the overhead replays being televised by CBS. Dave Phillips, the crew chief, said just prior to Game 2 that the umpires want \"CBS to be fair with their approach.\" Rick Gentile, senior vice president for production for CBS Sports, said that Richie Phillips, the lawyer for the Major League Umpires Association, tried to call the broadcast booth during Saturday's game, but the call was not put through. Richie Phillips apparently was upset when Dave Phillips called the Philadelphia Phillies' Ricky Jordan out on strikes in the fourth inning, and a replay showed the pitch to be about 6 inches outside. National League President Bill White, while using a CBS headset in the broadcast booth during Game 1, was overheard telling Gentile and the producer Bob Dekas, \"You guys keep using that camera the way you want. Don't let Phillips intimidate you.\"\nThe final Major League Baseball game that CBS has televised to date was Game 6 of the 1993 World Series on October 23. Before Major League Baseball decided to seek the services of other networks, CBS offered US$120 million in annual rights fees over a two-year period, as well as advertising revenues in excess of $150 million a season.\n1994.\nIn , ESPN renewed its baseball contract for six years (through the season). The new deal was worth $42.5 million per year and $255 million overall. The deal was ultimately voided after the season and ESPN was pretty much forced to restructure their contract.\nAfter the fall-out from CBS's financial problems from their exclusive, four-year-long, US$1.8 billion television contract with Major League Baseball (a contract that ultimately cost the network approximately $500 million), Major League Baseball decided to go into the business of producing the telecasts themselves and market these to advertisers on its own. In reaction to the failed trial with CBS, Major League Baseball was desperately grasping for every available dollar. To put things into proper perspective, in 1991, the second year of the league's contract with the network, CBS reported a loss of around $169 million in the third quarter of the year. A decline in advertiser interest caused revenue from the sale of commercials during CBS's baseball telecasts to plummet. All the while, CBS was still contractually obligated to pay Major League Baseball around $260 million a year through 1993. Before Major League Baseball decided to seek the services of other networks, CBS offered US$120 million in annual rights fees over a two-year period, as well as advertising revenues in excess of $150 million a season.\nAs part of MLB's attempt to produce and market the games in-house, it hoped to provide games of regional interests to appropriate markets. Major League Baseball in the process, hoped to offer important games for divisional races to the overall market. Owners also hoped that this particular technique, combined with the additional division races created through league expansion (the Colorado Rockies and Florida Marlins had begun play the year prior) and the quest for wild card spots for the playoffs (1994 was the first year of three divisions for each league) would increase the national broadcast revenue for Major League Baseball in the foreseeable future.\nAfter a four-year hiatus, ABC and NBC (who last aired \"Thursday Night Baseball\" games and the Saturday afternoon \"Game of the Week\" respectively) returned to Major League Baseball under the umbrella of a revenue-sharing venture called The Baseball Network. Under a six-year plan (with an option for two additional years), Major League Baseball was intended to receive 85% of the first US$140 million in advertising revenue (or 87.5% of advertising revenues and corporate sponsorship from the games until sales topped a specified level), 50% of the next $30 million, and 80% of any additional money. Prior to this, Major League Baseball was projected to take a projected 55% cut in rights fees and receive a typical rights fee from the networks. When compared to the previous TV deal with CBS, The Baseball Network was supposed to bring in 50% less of the broadcasting revenue. The advertisers were reportedly excited about the arrangement with The Baseball Network because the new package included several changes intended to boost ratings, especially among younger viewers.\nArranging broadcasts through The Baseball Network seemed, on the surface, to benefit NBC and ABC (who each contributed $10 million in start-up funds) since it gave them a monopoly on broadcasting Major League Baseball games. The deal was similar to a time-buy, instead of a traditional rights fee situation. It also stood to benefit the networks because they reduced the risk associated with purchasing the broadcast rights outright (in stark contrast to CBS's disastrous contract with Major League Baseball from the 1990–1993 seasons). NBC and ABC were to create a loss-free environment for each other and keep an emerging Fox, which had recently made an aggressive and ultimately successful $1.58 billion bid for the television rights for National Football Conference games (thus, becoming a major player in the sports broadcasting game in the process), at bay. As a result of Fox's NFL gain, CBS was weakened further by affiliate changes, as a number of stations jumped to Fox from CBS (for example, in Detroit, WWJ-TV replaced WJBK).\nThe Baseball Network kicked off its coverage on July 12, 1994 on NBC with the All-Star Game from Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh. The NBC broadcast team consisted of Bob Costas on play-by-play, with Joe Morgan and Bob Uecker as analysts. Costas, a veteran presence at NBC, had been the network's secondary baseball play-by-play announcer behind Vin Scully during the 1980s. Morgan, who was also working for ESPN at the time, had spent two years at NBC in the mid-1980s and two years at ABC from 1988-1989. Uecker, the longtime voice of the Milwaukee Brewers, returned to national television for the first time since he worked for ABC in the 1970s and early 1980s.\nGreg Gumbel hosted the pre game show; this was one of his first assignments for NBC after having left CBS Sports following the 1994 College World Series. Helping with interviews were Hannah Storm and Johnny Bench. The 1994 All-Star Game reportedly sold out all its advertising slots. This was considered an impressive financial accomplishment, given that one 30-second spot cost US$300,000.\nThe '94 All-Star game also was broadcast in Spanish on NBC's Secondary Audio Program. Boston Red Sox announcer Hector Martinez and seven time All-Star Tony Pérez were the announcers for the occasion.\nABC, meanwhile, was able to have its primary broadcast team from 1989 return intact. Al Michaels served as the play-by-play announcer once again. Tim McCarver, who had just spent four years at CBS, returned as an analyst along with Jim Palmer. On the subject of Michaels returning to baseball for the first time since the infamous Loma Prieta earthquake interrupted the 1989 World Series, Jim Palmer said, \"Here Al is, having done five games since 1989, and steps right in. It's hard to comprehend how one guy could so amaze.\"\nAfter the All-Star Game was complete, ABC took over coverage with what was to be their weekly slate of games. ABC was scheduled to televise six regular season games on Saturdays or Mondays in prime time. NBC would then pick up where ABC left off by televising six more regular season Friday night games. Every \"Baseball Night in America\" game was scheduled to begin at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time (or 8:00 p.m. Pacific Time if the game occurred on the West Coast). A single starting time gave the networks the opportunity to broadcast one game and then, simultaneously, cut to another game when there was a break in action.\nThe networks had exclusive rights for the twelve regular season dates, in that no regional or national cable service (such as ESPN or superstations like Chicago's WGN-TV or Atlanta's WTBS) or over-the-air broadcaster was allowed to telecast a Major League Baseball game on those dates. \"Baseball Night in America\" (which premiered on July 16, 1994) usually aired up to fourteen games based on the viewers' region (affiliates chose games of local interest to carry) as opposed to a traditional coast-to-coast format. Normally, announcers who represented each of the teams playing in the respective games were paired with each other. More specifically, on regional Saturday night broadcasts and all non-\"national\" broadcasts, TBN let the two lead announcers from the opposing teams call the games involving their teams together.\nGames involving either of the two Canadian-based MLB teams at the time, the Toronto Blue Jays and Montreal Expos, were not always included in the \"Baseball Night in America\" package. Canadian rightsholders were allowed to broadcast the games. When TSN (which owned the cable rights to the Blue Jays and Expos) covered the games in Canada, they re-broadcast the \"BNIA\" feed across their network. Typically, if the Blue Jays were idle for the day, the Expos would be featured on TSN. Also, CBET (the CBC affiliate in Windsor, Ontario) would air Blue Jays games if the Detroit Tigers were not playing at home that night or if the Blue Jays were scheduled to play in Detroit. Whether or not the game would air in the opposing team's market would depend on which time zone they were from, or if they shared a market with another team.\nIn even-numbered years, NBC would have the rights to the All-Star Game and both League Championship Series while ABC would have the World Series and newly created Division Series. In odd-numbered years, the postseason and All-Star Game television rights were supposed to alternate. When ABC and NBC last covered baseball together from 1976 to 1989, ABC had the rights to the World Series in odd-numbered years while NBC would cover the All-Star Game and both League Championship Series in said years. Likewise, this process would alternate in even numbered years, with ABC getting the All-Star Game and both LCS in years that NBC had the World Series.\nThe long-term plans for The Baseball Network began to crumble after players and owners went on strike on August 12, 1994. In addition to the cancellation of that year's World Series, ABC was denied its remaining \"Baseball Night in America\" telecasts and NBC was shut out of its game broadcast slate (which in 1994, was scheduled to begin on August 26) altogether. Both networks elected to dissolve the partnership with Major League Baseball on June 22, 1995. Both networks figured that as the delayed 1995 baseball season opened without a labor agreement, there was no guarantee against another strike. It should also be noted that under the terms of the agreement, it could be voided by any party if the venture did not produce a minimum of $330 million in revenue over the first two years.\nShortly after the start of the strike, Stanford University's Roger Noll argued that the Baseball Network deal (and the bargain-basement ESPN cable renewal, which went from $100 million to $42 million because of their losses) reflected \"poor business judgment on the part of management about the long-run attractiveness of their product to national broadcasters.\" He added that the $140 million that owners expected to share for the 1994 season (before the strike) from TBN was underestimated by \"one-third to one-half\" and fell below the annual average of $165 million needed to renew the TBN deal after two years. Meanwhile, Andy Zimbalist, author of \"Baseball and Billions\", and a players' union consulting economist, insisted that baseball could have done better than the TBN deal with some combination of CBS (which offered $120 million last-ditch bid for renewal), Fox and TBS. Baseball shut out CBS and could have waited longer before closing them out.\"\n1995.\nIn , ESPN broadcast the American League West tie-breaker game between the Seattle Mariners and California Angels with Jon Miller and Joe Morgan making the call.\nThe networks also promised not to begin any World Series weekend broadcasts after 7:20 p.m. Eastern Time. When CBS held the television rights, postseason games routinely aired on the East Coast at 8:30 p.m. at the earliest. This meant that Joe Carter's dramatic World Series clinching home run in 1993 occurred after midnight in the East. As CBS' baseball coverage progressed, the network dropped the 8:00 p.m. pregame coverage (in favor of airing sitcoms such as \"Evening Shade\") before finally starting its coverage at 8:30 p.m. Eastern Time. The first pitch would generally arrive at approximately 8:45 p.m.\nABC won the rights to the first dibs at the World Series in August 1993 after ABC Sports president Dennis Swanson won a coin toss by calling \"heads.\" Ken Schanzer, who was the CEO of The Baseball Network, handled the coin toss. Schanzer agreed to the coin toss by ABC and NBC at the outset as the means of determining the order in which they would divide up the playoffs.\nWhat separated The Baseball Network from previous television deals with Major League Baseball, and was by far the most controversial part of the deal, was that not all postseason games (aside from the World Series) were guaranteed to be shown nationally. To increase viewership by preventing games from being played in the afternoon (the league was the only professional sports league in the country to play postseason games during the afternoon), the National League and American League's division and championship series games were instead played simultaneously in primetime, and affiliates could only air one game each night, which were again determined regionally. If one playoff series had already concluded, the remaining games would be aired nationally. Despite the frustration of not being able to see both League Championship Series on a national level, the 1995 LCS averaged a 13.1 rating.\nA major problem with \"Baseball Night in America\" was the idea that viewers could not watch \"important\" games. Marty Noble put it in perspective by saying \"With the \"Network\" determining when games will begin and which games are made available to which TV markets, Major League Baseball can conduct parts of its pennant races in relative secrecy.\" What added to the troubles of The Baseball Network was the fact that \"Baseball Night in America\" held exclusivity over every market. This most severely impacted markets with two teams, specifically New York City (Mets and Yankees), the Greater Los Angeles Area (Dodgers and Angels), Chicago (Cubs and White Sox), the San Francisco Bay Area (Giants and A's), and even Texas (Astros and Rangers). For example, if \"Baseball Night in America\" showed a Yankees game, this meant that nobody in New York could see that night's Mets game and vice versa.\nThings got so bad for The Baseball Network that even local broadcasters objected to its operations. KSMO-TV in Kansas City, the primary over-the-air station for the Kansas City Royals, went as far as to sue the Royals for breach of contract resulting from their broadcasts being \"overexposed\" and violating its territorial exclusivity. Worse yet, even if a market had only one team, the ABC or NBC affiliate could still not broadcast that team's game if the start time was not appropriate for the time zone. For example, if the Detroit Tigers (the only team in their market) played a road game in Seattle, Oakland or Anaheim beginning at 8:00 p.m. Pacific Time (a late game), Detroit's Baseball Network affiliate (either WXYZ-TV or WDIV, depending on the network which held the rights to the game) could not air the game because the start time was too late for the Detroit area (11:00 p.m. Eastern Time). Detroit viewers only had the option of viewing the early game of the night.\n\"Sports Illustrated\" columnist Tom Verducci for one, was very harsh on The Baseball Network, dubbing it both \"America's regional pastime\" and an \"abomination.\" ABC Sports president Dennis Swanson, in announcing the dissolution of The Baseball Network, said \"The fact of the matter is, Major League Baseball seems incapable at this point in time, of living with any long term relationships, whether it's with fans, with players, with the political community in Washington, with the advertising community here in Manhattan, or with its TV partners.\"\nFive years after The Baseball Network dissolved, NBC Sports play-by-play announcer Bob Costas wrote in his book \"Fair Ball: A Fan's Case for Baseball\" that The Baseball Network was \"stupid and an abomination.\" Costas further wrote that the agreement involving the World Series being the only instance of The Baseball Network broadcasting a nationally televised game was an unprecedented surrender of prestige, as well as a slap to all serious fans. He believed that The Baseball Network fundamentally corrupted the game and acknowledged that the most impassioned fans in baseball were now prevented from watching many of the playoff games that they wanted to see, as all playoff games had been broadcast nationally for decades. Costas added that both the divisional series and the League Championship Series now merited scarcely higher priority than regional coverage provided for a Big Ten football game between Wisconsin and Michigan.\nAccording to Curt Smith's book, \"The Voice – Mel Allen's Untold Story\", the longtime New York Yankees broadcaster and \"This Week in Baseball\" host was quoted as saying \"You wonder how anything would be worse [than CBS]. What kind of show cancels a twenty-six-week-season's first fourteen weeks?\" (in response to TBN's tagline, \"Welcome to the Show\").\nDuring the 1995 Division Series, the fan frustration with The Baseball Network was so bad that the mere mention of it during the Mariners–Yankees ALDS from public address announcer Tom Hutyler at Seattle's Kingdome brought boos from most of the crowd. To further put things into perspective, 55% of the country was able to get the American League Championship Series (Cleveland-Seattle) while 45% got the National League Championship Series (Atlanta-Cincinnati) for at least the first two games on ABC.\nThe Baseball Network's contract stipulated that negotiations could only take place with NBC and ABC for 45 days, starting on August 15, 1995. But with NBC and ABC's refusal to continue after the 1995 season, baseball had to look at its future options. In October 1995, when it was a known fact that ABC and NBC were going to end their television deal/joint venture with Major League Baseball, preliminary talks rose about CBS returning. It was rumored that CBS would show Thursday night games (more specifically, a package of West Coast interleague games scheduled for the 11:30 Eastern/8:30 Pacific Time slot) while Fox would show Saturday afternoon games. CBS and Fox were also rumored to share rights to the postseason. In the end however, CBS's involvement did not come to pass and NBC became Fox's over-the-air national television partner. Whereas each team earned about $14 million in 1990 under CBS the later TV agreement with NBC and Fox beginning in 1996 earned each team about $6.8 million.\nTo salvage the remains of the partnership, ABC and NBC elected to share coverage of the 1995 postseason including the World Series. ABC wound up broadcasting Games 1, 4, and 5 of 1995 World Series while NBC would broadcast Games 2, 3, and 6 (which turned out to be the decisive game). Had the 1995 World Series gone to a seventh game, it would have then been broadcast by ABC. As it stands, Game 5 of the 1995 World Series is to date, the final Major League Baseball game to be broadcast on ABC.\nDuring the 1995 World Series, NBC's Hannah Storm was the first woman to serve as solo host of a World Series, and the first to preside over a World Series trophy presentation.\nOthers would argue that a primary reason for its failure was its abandoning of localized markets in favor of more lucrative and stable advertising contracts afforded by turning to a national model of broadcasting, similar to the National Football League's television package, which focuses on localized games, with one or two \"national\" games.\nIn the end, the venture would lose US$95 million in advertising and nearly $500 million in national and local spending. The Baseball Network generated only about $5.5 million per team in revenue for each of the two years that it operated. To put things into proper perspective, in 1993 alone, CBS generated about $14.7 million per team. Much of this could possibly be traced back to the strike causing a huge drop in revenue, which in return caused baseball salaries to decrease by approximately $140,000 on average in 1995.\nBoth ABC and NBC soon publicly vowed to cut all ties with Major League Baseball for the remainder of the 20th century, and Fox signed on to be the exclusive network carrier of Major League Baseball regular season games in 1996. However, NBC kept a postseason-only (with the exception of even-numbered years when NBC had the rights to the All-Star Game) deal in the end, signing a deal to carry three Division Series games, one half of the League Championship Series (the ALCS in even numbered years and the NLCS in odd numbered years; Fox would televise the other LCS in said years), and the 1997 and 1999 World Series respectively (Fox had exclusive rights to the 1996, 1998 and 2000 World Series). Beginning in 2001, Fox would become the exclusive broadcast network for the World Series.\n1996.\nIn , ESPN began a five-year contract with Major League Baseball worth $440 million and about $80 million per year. ESPN paid for the rights to a Wednesday night doubleheader and \"Sunday Night Baseball\", as well as Opening Day and holiday telecasts and all postseason games not aired on Fox or NBC. Major League Baseball staggered the times of first-round games to provide a full-day feast for viewers: ESPN could air games at 1 p.m., 4 p.m., and 11 p.m. EDT, with the broadcast networks telecasting the prime time game.\nOn November 7, 1995, Major League Baseball reached a television deal with Fox and NBC, allowing the former to obtain MLB game rights (assuming ABC's end of the contract). Fox paid $575 million for the five-year contract, a fraction less of the amount of money that CBS had paid for the Major League Baseball television rights for the 1990–1993 seasons.\nUnlike the previous television deal, \"The Baseball Network\" (a partnership created through the league's joint contract with ABC and NBC that began in the 1994 season), Fox reverted to the format of televising regular season games (approximately 16 weekly telecasts that normally began on Memorial Day weekend) on Saturday afternoons. Fox did, however, continue a format that \"The Baseball Network\" started by offering a selection of games based purely on a viewer's region. Fox's approach has usually been to offer three regionalized telecasts. The initial deal also gave Fox the rights to broadcast the 1996, 1998 and 2000 World Series, the 1997 and 1999 All-Star Games, as well as coverage of the League Championship Series (shared with NBC) and five Division Series games each year.\nWhen Fox first began carrying baseball, it used the motto \"Same game, new attitude.\" to promote the telecasts, which had previously been used to promote the network's National Football League coverage when it began in 1994. Fox's primary goal when it first began airing Major League Baseball games was to promote their weak prime time schedule (which at the time included only a handful of hits, such as established series \"Beverly Hills 90210\", \"The Simpsons\" and \"Married... with Children\"). Fox Sports president Ed Goren said, \"We'll use the World Series and League Championship Series to spur our shows\". Like its predecessor NBC, Fox determined its Saturday schedule by which MLB franchise was playing a team from one of the three largest television markets – New York City, Los Angeles or Chicago. If there was a game which featured teams from two of these three markets (involving any combination of the Yankees, Mets, Dodgers, Angels, Cubs or White Sox), that game would be aired on the network.\nFor its first year of coverage in 1996, Fox used the scoring bug on their Major League Baseball telecasts. Within two years, the bug would be expanded to all sports telecasts on Fox and other networks. The first scoring bug was a translucent parallelogram with red borders on the left and right. The Fox logo and inning were on the left side, with the score on the right side. The count and number of outs were underneath. A diamond would be displayed around the bug only when runners were on base. An occupied base was represented by a red dot.\nAs previously mentioned, despite the failure of The Baseball Network, NBC decided to retain its relationship with Major League Baseball, but on a far more restricted basis. Under the five-year deal signed on November 7, 1995 (running from the 1996 to 2000 seasons) for a total of approximately $400 million, NBC did not televise any regular season games. Instead, NBC only handled the All-Star Game, three Division Series games (on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday nights), and the American League Championship Series in even-numbered years and the World Series, three Division Series games (also on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday nights) and the National League Championship Series in odd-numbered years. Fox, which assumed ABC's portion of the league broadcast television rights, gained the rights to the Saturday \"Game of the Week\" during the regular season, in addition to alternating rights to the All-Star Game, League Championship Series (the ALCS in odd-numbered years and the NLCS in even-numbered years), Division Series and the World Series.\nFrom -, NBC aired LDS games on Tuesday/Friday/Saturday nights. Fox aired LDS games on Wednesday/Thursday nights, Saturdays in the late afternoon, plus Sunday/Monday nights (if necessary). Meanwhile, ESPN carried many afternoon LDS contests. At this point, all playoff games were nationally televised (mostly in unopposed timeslots).\nAlso around this particular period, NBC adapted composer Randy Edelman's theme from the short-lived Fox series \"The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.\" as the main theme music for its baseball telecasts. However, NBC used Edelman's \"Emotions Run High\" from the film \"The Big Green\" as the theme for the network's coverage of the 1996 All-Star Game.\nFrom 1996 to 2002, and since 2010-2014, MLB International broadcasts the League Championship Series alternately, with the American League Championship Series in even-numbered years and the National League Championship Series in odd-numbered years.\nAll World Series games from 1981 to 1996 were televised in Canada on CTV, using the feed from the US network broadcaster.\nThe Atlanta Braves became the first Major League Baseball team to appear in World Series broadcast on all four major networks (NBC in 1957–58 and 1995, ABC in 1995, CBS in 1991–92 and Fox in 1996. The Philadelphia Phillies have since duplicated this feat (NBC in 1950 and 1980, ABC in 1983, CBS in 1993 and Fox in 2008–09).\nFor Game 2 of the 1996 World Series (rescheduled to Monday night due to a rainout), Fox used an early start (7 p.m. Eastern Time) to minimize the overlap with \"Monday Night Football\" on ABC.\n1997.\nOn July 8, 1997, Fox televised its first ever All-Star Game (out of Jacobs Field in Cleveland). For this particular game, Fox introduced \"Catcher-Cam\" in which a camera was affixed to the catchers' masks in order to provide unique perspectives of the action around home plate. Catcher-Cam soon would become a regular fixture on Fox's baseball broadcasts.\nAlso in 1997, just before the start of NBC's coverage of the World Series, Don Ohlmeyer, president of the network's West Coast entertainment division and former executive producer for NBC Sports, came under fire after publicly announcing that he hoped that the World Series would end in a four-game sweep. Ohlmeyer believed that baseball now lacked broad audience appeal (especially in the aftermath of the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike). As opposed to teams from the three largest television markets (New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago) in the U.S., the 1997 World Series featured the matchup of the upstart Florida Marlins and the Cleveland Indians, which made their second World Series appearance in three years. In addition, Ohlmeyer feared that the World Series would disrupt NBC's efforts to attract enough viewers for its new fall roster in order to stay on top of the ratings heap. Ohlmeyer said \"If the A&amp;E channel called, I'd take the call.\" Game 5 fell on a Thursday, which had long been the highest rated night on NBC's schedule, if not on all of television.\nGame 7 of the 1997 World Series caused a scheduled Chicago Bears–Miami Dolphins game to be postponed to Monday night. It was seen on ABC in the Chicago and Miami markets, and was intended to air on Fox. The rest of the nation received the scheduled Green Bay Packers–New England Patriots game, the only time a rematch of a previous season's Super Bowl aired on ABC.\n1998.\nFox's scoring bug was slightly modified in 1998. The layout remained the same but it now was a square. The teams and scores also now had a white background, with a red arrow indicating which team was at bat. Occupied bases were now represented by a yellow triangle. Also beginning in 1998, pitch speed began to briefly cover the count and outs area after a pitch was thrown.\nIn 1998, Bob Uecker abruptly left NBC Sports before a chance to call the All-Star Game from Coors Field in Colorado. Uecker underwent a back operation in which four discs were replaced. For the remainder of the contract (1998–2000), only Bob Costas and Joe Morgan called the games. Also in 1998, NBC's coverage of the ALCS was the highest rated for any League Championship Series since before the 1994 strike. NBC averaged a 9.4 rating for the six games, which was a 6% increase than the network's coverage of the 1997 NLCS in the same time slot. The rating was 13% more than Fox's ALCS coverage in 1997 and 12% more than NBC's coverage in 1996.\nAlso in , ESPN broadcast the National League Wild Card tie-breaker game between the Chicago Cubs and San Francisco Giants. Jon Miller and Joe Morgan were on the call.\n1999.\nIn 1999, Fox unveiled a new scoring bug that was nearly identical to the NFL bug unveiled the previous fall. A permanent baserunner graphic (with a design that would be used through 2008) was on the left side of the bug and occupied bases would light up in yellow. The team scores were on a black background on the right side of the bug. A bar with the Fox logo and the inning (now with a standard up or down arrow to indicate top or bottom of the inning) extended from the top. A bar with the count and the number of outs extended from the bottom.\nAlso in , Bob Costas teamed with his then-NBC colleague Joe Morgan to call two weekday night telecasts for ESPN. The first was on Wednesday, August 25 with Detroit Tigers playing against the Seattle Mariners. The second was on Tuesday, September 21 with the Atlanta Braves playing against the New York Mets.\nESPN also broadcast the National League Wild Card tie-breaker game (this time between the New York Mets and Cincinnati Reds) once again with Jon Miller and Joe Morgan once again on the call.\nThe 1999 World Series was NBC's 39th and, to date, final World Series telecast. Fox would air the next World Series as part of the contract in place, and acquired the exclusive broadcast rights of Major League Baseball beginning in 2001. With the Knicks having played in the NBA Finals in June, this was the second championship series in 1999 that NBC broadcast involving teams from New York. Bob Costas, Jim Gray, and Hannah Storm were involved both times. Costas with play-by-play, Gray as a reporter, and Storm as pre-game host. Prior to Cleveland in 2016, this was the most recent year of a same city hosting both NBA Finals and World Series in the same year.\nDuring the World Series, NBC field reporter Jim Gray, who had previously covered Major League Baseball for CBS, came under fire for a confrontational interview with banned all-time hit king Pete Rose. Just prior to the start of Game 2 of the World Series, Gray pushed Rose – on hand (by permission of Commissioner Bud Selig) at Turner Field in Atlanta as a fan-selected member of MasterCard's \"All-Century Team\" – to admit to having wagered on baseball games as manager of the Cincinnati Reds ten years earlier. After NBC was flooded with tons of viewer complaints, Gray was forced to clarify his actions to the viewers at home prior to Game 3. Regardless of Gray's sincerity, Game 3 hero Chad Curtis of the New York Yankees boycotted Gray's request for an interview live on camera; Curtis had hit a game-winning home run to send the World Series 3–0 in the Yankees' favor. Curtis said to Gray, \"Because of what happened with Pete, we decided not to say anything.\"\nDespite the heavy criticism he received, Gray offered no apology for his line of questioning toward Rose:\nAlthough Dick Ebersol (then-president of NBC Sports) and Keith Olbermann – among others – have maintained that Gray was simply doing his job, in 2004 Pete Rose would admit to betting on baseball (along with other sports) while he was the manager of the Cincinnati Reds."

The tournament is held in January or February, and forms part of the WTA and ATP tours. The event is part of the lead-up to the first Grand Slam tournament of the season, the Australian Open.\nHistory.\nThe establishment of the Brisbane International in 2009 saw the city of Adelaide miss out on continuing to host an ATP or WTA lead-up event to the Australian Open. Over the next ten years Adelaide hosted the World Tennis Challenge, an exhibition event played featuring past players. The unveiling of the multi-city ATP Cup competition, held around the same time, resulted in the abolition of the Hopman Cup and the condensing of other tournaments, thereby allowing sufficient room in the calendar for the Adelaide International. In February 2019, the South Australian Government announced it would invest $10 million to construct a canopy-roof structure over the Memorial Drive Tennis Centre, after securing a five-year deal with Tennis Australia to host the new event at the upgraded facility. The new tournament was launched later that year, with then-world number four and two-time Grand-Slam champion Simona Halep being confirmed as the first player to play in the 2020 Adelaide International. The new international tournament was a combined WTA Premier and ATP 250 event.\nIn 2021, a WTA-only tournament was held after the Australian Open, from February 22–27.\nIn 2022, there were two back-to-back Adelaide Internationals from January 1st to January 14th. The events were combined ATP 250 and WTA 250 tournaments with Gaël Monfils and Ashleigh Barty winning the men's and women's singles in the first tournament, and Thanasi Kokkinakis and Madison Keys winning the men's and women's singles in the second tournament."

        "title": "1891 Southern Rugby Union season",
        "text": "The 1891 Southern Rugby Football Union season was the 18th season of the Sydney Rugby Premiership. This was the second competition for the Agricultural Society Challenge Cup which was awarded to the winners of the premiership. The football season lasted from May to August. The premiership was won for the fifth time in succession by the Sydney University Football Club, who were undefeated once again, winning the final against Zealandia. The Junior Badges saw Wentworth defeat the Pirates for the second year in succession. The Second Junior Badges, previously known as the Union Cup, saw Carlton defeat Sydney University 2nd in the final. A Third Junior Badges was created and won by Randwick Austral, who defeated Roslyn in the final.\nTeams.\nFor the 1891 premiership, 10 teams submitted entries for the senior cup. These teams had all competed in the premiership during the prior season. Of the teams that had participated last year, Elvira failed to survive into the new season. Unfortunately the decision was made by the club to not put together a team as many of their players had moved across to other clubs within the Balmain area.\nRule Changes.\nWith the new season, the Union decided to make changes in regards to the number of competitions for junior clubs. In addition to the Senior Cup, Junior Badges and Second Junior Badges (formally the Union Cup) the Union decided to add a Third Junior Badges. Clubs could submit entries to the competition of their choice with second fifteens not allowed to participate in the Junior Badges. The Agricultural Society Cup was to be handed to the winner of the senior competition. For the Junior Badges, AJ Torning supplied silver medals for the winners. Entries closed during the first week in May with the Union writing the draw for each of the four competitions. Games would begin on 30 May with regular season matches finishing on 25 July for the senior clubs and 15 August for the Junior Badges. At the conclusion of the regular matches the top four ranked teams would progress to the semi-finals.\nSeason Summary.\nDuring the season, it was seen that a few clubs struggled to field a team. As soon as a club began to encounter a few losses the players became dissatisfied and started to desert the club. Rather than working hard at turning around the performance of the team, these players began to fervently seek places at a winning club. As a result, some clubs became defunct. Calls were made for the Union to step in and stop this behaviour. Victims of this type of behaviour were Rosedale and Arfoma. Both clubs had seen much success in previous seasons. Prior to the premiership games starting, Arfoma were already losing prominent players with some failing to appear at trial matches. Albert Sefton, the club secretary, was doing his best at holding the club together. The same was happening at Rosedale with most of their prominent players having already deserted the club prior to the season. Players James McMahon and Arthur Braund had already signed up with the Sydney club. By the second round of games on 6 June, both clubs were barely existing. Arfoma forfeited their match against Parramatta that caused some poor feeling towards the struggling club. By the following week the club had ceased to exist with Sefton putting on the Randwick colours and seeing out the season with them. Rosedale were able to muster 13 men to play their second round match against Strathfield. Within the first few minutes Strathfield began to score freely causing the Rosedale players to lose heart. Players began to leave the field with Rosedale eventually left with only 9 players to stop their opponents from scoring more points. The game was called after 25 minutes in the favour of Strathfield. Rosedale soon withdrew their senior team from the premiership, releasing their players to join other clubs.\nSydney University had the fortune of receiving three forfeits during the regular games. With both games against Rosedale and Arfoma called off, the Zealandia also failed to muster a team to play the eventual premiers. This gave the Varsity an advantage during the middle of the season. Despite this, the team easily dispatched their opponents in most games. After being on a winning streak since 1887, the Varsity were finally held to a draw. Their match against Strathfield ended in a 3 all draw. This was their first draw since the first round of the 1887 season, ending their winning streak at 41. Despite this, the Varsity were firm favourites entering the final. The team left no doubt of their superiority with a commanding display to take their fifth premiership in as many years.\nAfter winning their first game of the season, a mid-season slump nearly saw the Zealandia club miss out on the finals. However, a brace of wins in the final rounds of the qualifying games saw them in contention for the final spot. Zealandia secured their spot in the finals in a peculiar way. Earlier in the season, the team forfeited their match against University A due to not being able to field the players. This forfeit had seen them receive no points against them on the for and against. With their opponents receiving a large score against them in their games against the Varsity, Zealandia were able to take the fourth position in the finals based on their points difference. The club took advantage of the unfortunate absence of players in the Strathfield team to progress to the final. Once there, Zealandia did not show their best game against the eventual premiers and were beaten comprehensively.\nDuring the off-season, the Strathfield club was most prominent in attempting to encourage players to switch to their club. With the addition of a few prominent players, it was hoped that they would be a match for the dominant University. Unfortunately they met with little success on this front as players refused to change clubs. Despite this, Strathfield performed well during the season, losing only one match prior to the finals. The team displayed promise when they held the dominant University to a 3 all draw. However, the team were missing some vital players in their semi final match against Zealandia, ending their premiership chances.\nWallaroo were considered to be the only club to be able to compete with the eventual premiers. It was believed that their defence was almost perfect with only two tries scored against them prior to the final match against University A. The club remained undefeated until they faced the Varsity in the final round of the qualifying matches. A close game saw Wallaroo lose the match 8 points to 3. With the semi-finals decided by ballot, Wallaroo had the poor fortune of meeting the Varsity again the following week. Another tight contest saw the club bow out of the premiership.\nFinals.\nThe semi finals were arranged by ballot with Sydney University playing against Wallaroo and Zealandia playing against Strathfield. Both matches were held on the Agricultural Society Ground. The match between Strathfield and Zealandia saw the Kiwi's win 16 points to nil. Despite the final scoreline, Strathfield displayed excellent defence for much of the match and with a few less errors the score may have been more favourable towards them. Missing from their team were goal kicking master Robert Lusk, who was still injured from a previous match, and try scoring wizard Harry Moses. James McCausland shone for Zealandia, kicking two goals from the field. Sydney University began with great pace in their match against Wallaroo, causing their opponents much trouble during the first half. Wallaroo were continually required to defend their lines from the fierce attacks of James Moulton, Harry Abbott and Percy Colquhoun. Within the first 15 minutes of the match, University scored all of their points. Tiredness soon set in for the Varsity in the second half which allowed Wallaroo to hold them back from adding to their total. Wallaroo were able to score late in the match to bring the final scoreline to 10 points to 5 in favour of the University.\nFinal, 8 August.\nA large number of people came out to watch the final between Sydney University and Zealandia at the Agricultural Society Ground. Entering into the match, the Varsity were favourites with some considering it a foregone conclusion. The sunny weather saw the Varsity immediately press their opponents from the kick-off. Within the first twenty minutes, they put up 9 points to nil. Colquhoun of Sydney University played his usual exceptional game. McCausland defended well for the Zealandia, stopping a number of runs. By half time, the University had stretched the scoreline out to 12 points to nil. A humorous and strange thing happened during the early part of the first half. The ball from the Wentworth-Pirates match, which was playing on the adjoining ground, was kicked just beyond the Varsity forwards during a scrum. Some of the Zealandia players made off with the ball and managed to get across the University line with no opposition. In celebrating what they thought was a try, they soon realised that their opponents were pressing their teammates hard with the correct game ball. The crowd were highly entertained by this embarrassing mistake. After changing ends, the Zealandia began to press the University hard with George Lusk managing to kick a goal to put points on the board for his team. Zealandia were fired up as a result and continue to put pressure on the Varsity goal line. However, their work came to no end with the Varsity taking the ball back to their opponents goal line. University got behind the Zealandia line a number of times from this moment, raising the scoreline to 28 points to 4. In the last minutes, McCausland managed to score a goal from the field. Time was called soon after. Sydney University left no doubt as to their superiority as they ran over their opponents with the final score standing at 28 points to 8. Questions were asked as to the worthiness of Zealandia as runner-up with some considering them earning the position through luck.\nLower Grades.\nJunior Badges.\nEleven clubs submitted entries for the Junior Badges with a draw released to include games from 30 May to 15 August. Teams would continue to be ranked by points, with the top four being admitted into the semi-finals to contest for the badges. The Union maintained that the Junior competition would not include second fifteens of teams. Once again, AJ Torning offered silver medals for the winners of the Junior Badges, the offer being accepted by the Union. At the conclusion of the regular season matches, the top three teams finished on the same number of points with the fourth team only two points behind. The semi finals saw Wentworth defeat Burwood 11 points to nil and the Pirates defeat Double Bay by 8 points to nil. With the final being played at the Agricultural Society Ground, the match was very reminiscent of the previous season's with the same two teams playing for the badges. The Pirates were favourites for the final, with the hope they would be able to reverse the result from the previous season. However, Wentworth proved to be the superior club, winning the final and the premiership. The match remained close until late in the second half, when Wentworth scored three unanswered tries. Wentworth were premiers for a second time.\nSecond Junior Badges.\nTwenty-two clubs submitted entries for the Second Junior Badges, previously known as the Union Badges. Like the Junior Badges, the competition continued to rank teams by points with the top four progressing to the semi-finals. Interestingly, the Rosedale club continued to have a presence in the Second Junior competition despite their senior team pulling out of the Agricultural Cup. At the end of the preliminary matches Randwick 2nd and Carlton finished tied on the top of the table. Both University 2nd and Liverpool finished in the top four to also progress to the semi-finals. The draw for these matches saw Randwick 2nd up against University 2nd at the Agricultural Society Ground and Carlton drawn against Liverpool at Burwood. The Varsity defeated their opponents 13 points to 3 to progress to the finals. The second match saw Carlton defeat Liverpool 8 points to 3. The final was eagerly anticipated with both University and Carlton having played a draw during the preliminary matches. A keenly contested match saw Carlton defeat the Varsity by 10 points to 3.\nThird Junior Badges.\nIn 1891 it was decided by the Union to create a Third Junior Badges. Twenty-three clubs submitted entries for the new competition. After the regular matches, Surrey and Randwick Austral finished on equal points at the top of the table with Redfern Parkhurst and Roslyn also qualifying for semi finals. The draw for the semi-finals saw Austral and Surrey play against each other on the Agricultural Ground. The match was a tight one which went into extra time with Austral scoring 8 points to Surrey's nil to win the match. The second semi was another stubborn affair with Roslyn defeating Redfern Parkhurst 4 points to 3. Despite expectations for Austral to run away with the match, the final turned out to be a better contest. The match was not a great example of Rugby play, however the final result saw Austral narrowly defeat Roslyn 3 points to nil.\nRepresentative Games.\nIntercolonial Matches.\nAt the end of the Sydney Rugby Premiership, a contingent of players were sent to Queensland to represent NSW in the Intercolonial matches. Unfortunately, many of the more prominent players were not available for selection, with the team considered to not be the best that could have been put into the field. Those that could not make themselves available did so mostly due to the scheduling of the matches and having to travel to Queensland to play.\nThe first match saw heavy clouds gather over the ground prior to the beginning of the match. As the game proceeded, the weather turned nasty with heavy rain making the ground muddy and the ball slippery. Queensland were deemed to have the best of the match with the team crossing over for three tries to New South Wales one. The first half saw an even contest with NSW leading into the break 9 points to 3. With the rain making everything slippery, it was believed that the visitors should have had the advantage during the second half. However, the Queensland forwards played brilliantly resulting in the team scoring 6 more points to bring the scoreline level. With better luck, the local team may have won the match. Twice the Queenslanders crossed the visitors line failing to ground the ball and any kicks with the sodden ball did not find their mark. It was obvious that the New South Wales players were tired and out of condition in the second half.\nThe return match between the two old sparring partners was played a week later. The match saw a decisive win for the Queenslanders with the final score 11 points to nil. However, before the match had begun, controversy was seen with the choice of referee for the match. Mr FC Lea was chosen by the local team to umpire the match, however questions were raised by the visitors in regards to his fairness. An ultimatum was put to the NSW team: accept the umpire chosen or the match would not go ahead. It was believed that the Northern Union did a great disservice to the visitors in insisting their choice be accepted with some suggesting that the NSW team should have stood their ground. The play during the first half was rather even with neither team being able to score. However, the Queenslanders did all of the scoring in the second half. This was done in spite of the winners playing much of the half with a man down. Once again, the visitors tired in the second half."

        "text": "Championship Motocross Featuring Ricky Carmichael is a video game developed by Funcom Dublin and published by THQ for the PlayStation in 1999. It is the first of four motocross racing games published by THQ to be endorsed by professional motocross racer Ricky Carmichael. A sequel, \"Championship Motocross 2001 Featuring Ricky Carmichael\", was released for Game Boy Color in 2000, and for PlayStation in 2001.\nDevelopment.\nThe game was showcased at E3 1999. A port was planned for the Nintendo 64 by Pacific Coast Power &amp; Light, but it was canceled before it began.\nReception.\nThe game received favorable reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Jeff Lundrigan of \"NextGen\" was positive to the game, but noted that its high level of difficulty would frustrate many players. In Japan, where the game was ported and published by MediaWorks with the name on January 6, 2000, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of 27 out of 40. \"GamePro\" gave three 4/5 scores for graphics, sound, and control, and 3/5 for overall fun factor. One \"GameFan\" critic gave it a score of 69, and the other 70.\nLegacy.\nTHQ's partnership with Carmichael would endure for several more years, resulting in three more motocross racing games that received endorsement from Carmichael: a sequel to the game, titled \"Championship Motocross 2001 Featuring Ricky Carmichael\", followed by what would be the first two installments of the \"Championship Motocross\" duology's follow-up series, the \"MX\" trilogy: \"MX 2002 featuring Ricky Carmichael\" and \"MX Superfly featuring Ricky Carmichael\". This new trilogy, released on sixth-generation platforms, would be a precursor to THQ's racing series, \"MX vs. ATV\", a crossover with Sony's \"ATV Offroad Fury\" series."

His style of dribbling aroused cheers from spectators, and once got fouls called on him in a 1-point loss to the Atlanta Athletic Club. \"Maybe the referee was so surprised that such a thing could be done that he was not responsible for what he did.\" Harmon was \"acknowledged king of the basketball world in so far as Southern circles are concerned.\" He was \"one of the all-time greats\" in Mercer basketball history\".\nMercer was the runner-up to North Carolina in the 1922 SoCon tournament, and upset the prior season's champion Kentucky.

In baseball, the statistic applies also to players who, before a game, are included on a starting lineup card or are announced as \"ex ante\" substitutes, whether or not they play; however, in Major League Baseball, the application of this statistic does not extend to consecutive games played streaks. A starting pitcher, then, may be credited with a game played even if he is not credited with a game started or an inning pitched. First base, or 1B, is the first of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a baserunner to score a run for that player's team. A first baseman is the player on the team playing defense who fields the area nearest first base, and is responsible for the majority of plays made at that base. It is the only one of the four infield positions commonly played by left-handed players. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the first baseman is assigned the number 3.\nThroughout major league history, there have been players who enjoyed long careers as first basemen; in the 19th century, Cap Anson was the first player ever to appear in 2,000 games at any single position. Through 2021, 21 players had appeared in over 2,000 games as first basemen, more than at any other position; at least one of the 21 has been active in every major league season, except the last two years of World War II. Eddie Murray is the all-time leader in career games as a first baseman, playing 2,413 games at the position."

He began to pay for his early speed, slowing as he turned for home. Alison dos Santos was gaining over the 9th hurdle and Juander could sense a challenge coming as he stretched his steps to get over the 10th. Juander's lead foot hit the hurdle squarely and he crashed to the ground. Clearing it cleanly, Alison cruised in, hands outstretched, to an easy win.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Pan American Games records were as follows:\nResults.\nAll times shown are in seconds.\nSemifinal.\nQualification: First 3 in each heat (Q) and next 2 fastest (q) qualified for the final.

For most of the first lap, Sade Sealy sat immediately on Almanza's outer shoulder until the first pass down the home straight, when Natoya Goule moved forward into the outer position, briefly poking into the lead at the bell. Almanza would not let Goule get far enough ahead to move in. Sealy had to drop directly behind Almanza, with Déborah Rodríguez boxing her from the outside. At the beginning of the final turn, Goule tried to accelerate around Almanza, but was held to the outside through the entire turn. Coming off the turn, Almanza accelerated and gained a slight advantage, the two battling almost shoulder to shoulder down the home straight. 50 metres to go, Almanza's face began to show strain, Goule gained the advantage and went on for the win. Fighting as she tied up, Almanza strained to hold off the fast closing Rodríguez, making one last jerk to get her torso over the finish line .02 ahead to retain silver\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Pan American Games records were as follows:\nResults.\nAll times shown are in seconds.\nSemifinal.\nQualification: First 3 in each heat (Q) and next 2 fastest (q) qualified for the final.

        "text": "The men's artistic individual all-around competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics was held at Earls Court Exhibition Centre on 12 and 13 August. It was the tenth appearance of the event. There were 123 competitors from 16 nations, with each nation sending a team of up to 8 gymnasts. The event was won by Veikko Huhtanen of Finland, the nation's first victory in the men's all-around. Finland also earned bronze, with Paavo Aaltonen finishing third. For the second consecutive Games, Switzerland took silver—this time with Walter Lehmann as the nation's medalist.\nBackground.\nThis was the 10th appearance of the men's individual all-around. The first individual all-around competition had been held in 1900, after the 1896 competitions featured only individual apparatus events. A men's individual all-around has been held every Games since 1900.\nTwo of the top 10 gymnasts from the pre-war 1936 Games returned: fifth-place finisher Michael Reusch of Switzerland and ninth-place finisher Heikki Savolainen of Finland. Savolainen had also finished in the top 10 in 1928 and won a bronze medal in the event in 1932. Reigning gold medalist Alfred Schwarzmann was unable to defend his title due to Germany not being invited to the Games following World War II, though he would return in 1952. The last World Championships had been held in 1938, with no international competitions since the war, so it was difficult to determine a favorite.\nArgentina, Cuba, and Mexico each made their debut in the event. Italy made its ninth appearance, most among nations, having missed only the 1904 Games in St. Louis.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics format continued to use the aggregation format. Each nation entered a team of up to eight gymnasts (Cuba and Argentina had only 7; Mexico only 5). All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus, with the scores summed to give a final total. The scores in each of the six apparatus competitions were added together to give individual all-around scores; the top six individual scores on each team were summed to give a team all-around score. No separate finals were contested.\nFor each exercise, four judges gave scores from 0 to 10 in one-tenth point increments. The top and bottom scores were discarded and the remaining two scores summed to give the exercise total. If the two scores were sufficiently far apart, the judges would \"confer\" and decide on a score. Thus, exercise scores ranged from 0 to 20, apparatus scores from 0 to 40, individual totals from 0 to 240, and team scores from 0 to 1,440."

        "title": "Gymnastics at the 1952 Summer Olympics – Men's artistic individual all-around",
        "text": "The men's artistic individual all-around competition at the 1952 Summer Olympics was held at Messuhalli, Exhibition Hall I from 19 to 21 July. It was the eleventh appearance of the event. There were 185 competitors from 29 nations. Each nation entered a team of between five and eight gymnasts or up to three individual gymnasts. The event was won by Viktor Chukarin of the Soviet Union, with his countryman Hrant Shahinyan taking silver. It was the Soviet debut in the event, beginning four decades of dominance rivalled only by Japan and ending only after the dissolution of the Soviet Union; the Soviets would win 6 of the 10 editions from 1952 to 1988 (and the Unified Team would sweep the medals in 1992), with Japan taking the other 4. Bronze in 1952 went to Josef Stalder of Switzerland (the nation's third consecutive Games on the podium); it was the last medal in the men's all-around for any gymnast not from the Soviet Union or Japan until 1980.\nBackground.\nThis was the 11th appearance of the men's individual all-around. The first individual all-around competition had been held in 1900, after the 1896 competitions featured only individual apparatus events. A men's individual all-around has been held every Games since 1900.\nSeven of the top 11 gymnasts (including a tie for 10th place) from the 1948 Games returned: bronze medalist Paavo Aaltonen of Finland, fourth-place finisher Josef Stalder of Switzerland, seventh-place finisher Zdeněk Růžička of Czechoslovakia, eighth-place finisher Kalevi Laitinen of Finland, ninth-place finisher Guido Figone of Italy, and tenth-place finishers Olavi Rove of Finland and Lajos Tóth of Hungary. The 1936 gold medalist Alfred Schwarzmann (who was unable to defend his title in 1948 due to Germany not being invited to the London Games following World War II) also returned. The top two finishers at the 1950 World Championships (Switzerland's Walter Lehmann and Marcel Adatte) did not compete in Helsinki; Rove, at third place, was the highest finisher from the World Championships to compete in 1952.\nIndia, Poland, Portugal, Saar, South Africa, the Soviet Union, Spain, and Sweden each made their debut in the event. Italy made its 10th appearance, most among nations, having missed only the 1904 Games in St. Louis.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics format continued to use the aggregation format. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The 12 exercise scores were summed to give a total. No separate finals were contested.\nFor each exercise, four judges gave scores from 0 to 10 in one-tenth point increments. The top and bottom scores were discarded and the remaining two scores averaged to give the exercise total. Thus, exercise scores ranged from 0 to 10, apparatus scores from 0 to 20, and individual totals from 0 to 120.\nFor the vault, each competitor had two tries for each of the compulsory and voluntary vaults with the better score to count. For the other four (non-floor) apparatus exercises, the competitor had the option to make a second try only on the compulsory exercise—with the second attempt counting regardless of whether it was better than the first. For both compulsory and voluntary floor exercises, and voluntary exercises in the non-floor, non-vault apparatuses, only one attempt could be made."

Approximately 6,650 athletes from 41 NOCs will participate in 419 events in 39 sports.\nThe United States topped the medal count with 122 gold and 293 overall medals, its best result in the 21st century. Brazil pulled off its best performance in history, winning 54 gold and 169 overall medals, and finishing second in the standings. Mexico (37 golds) edged Canada (35), Argentina (33) and Cuba (33) in the battle for the third place. The Canadians, however, won the most total medals among the three, 152. For Cuba, it was their worst result since 1971 in terms of gold medals. For Chile, it was their best result in history in terms of golds and total medals.\nMedal table.\nThe ranking in this table is based on information provided by Panam Sports and is consistent with convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a \"nation\" is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by IOC country code.\nIn badminton, boxing, judo, karate, racquetball, taekwondo, table tennis, and wrestling two bronze medals will be awarded for each event. Also in bowling, fencing and squash two bronze medals will be awarded in some events. Therefore, the total number of bronze medals will be greater than the total number of gold or silver medals. The following is the medal table maintained by the official website of the games.\nThe British Virgin Islands won its first ever gold medal and its first ever Pan American Games medal after Chantel Malone won the women's long jump athletics event. Aruba also earned its first medal in the history of the Pan American Games, a bronze medal won by sailor Mack van den Eerenbeemt in . This means all current participating countries have now at least won one medal.\nBarbados, Bolivia, Grenada and Paraguay also won their first ever gold medals at the Pan American Games.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "text": "The SRU Super Series, known as the FOSROC Super Series for sponsorship reasons, and prior to 2023 known as Super 6 is a professional league for Scottish rugby union clubs, which began in 2019. As of 2023, the league consists of two competitions;\nConcept.\nSix clubs were awarded licences to play in the new Super 6 league by the Scottish Rugby Union.\nThe idea of the Super 6 was to bridge a perceived gap between the Scottish Premiership and the then Pro14 league (now the United Rugby Championship league) level to aid player progression. The six clubs will be turned into semi-professional clubs with a squad budget of £125,000 each. Every team will have a 35-man squad.\nFormat.\nThe league is designed to bridge the gap between the amateur grade and the fully professional United Rugby Championship teams.\nSix core clubs contest the league, joined by the Scotland Under 20 development team from 2023. In 2019, the six core teams entered into a contract for 5 years and there is planned to be no relegation or replacement in that period.\nThe top level of club rugby in Scotland consists of the two professional teams - Edinburgh Rugby and Glasgow Warriors - that play in the United Rugby Championship competition. They assign their players to the clubs below in a Pro-Draft; so that they can still play when not used by the professional sides.\nSeasons.\nThe Super 6 tournament began in November 2019 after the rugby world cup of that year.\nIt was planned that the clubs would play 20 fixtures in total: 10 fixtures against one another home and away and then 2 play-off matches - which would conclude the Super 6 fixtures. A further 8 matches scheduled against non-Scottish clubs would then be played by the Super 6 clubs but this was to be outside the Super 6 competition.\nThe first season was curtailed after the league finished and there were no play-off matches due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe tournament did not run in season 2020-21 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Ayrshire Bulls became the inaugural Super 6 champions after defeating The Southern Knights at Dam Park in the playoff final.\nIn November 2021, plans were announced that the tournament would be expanded in 2022 to include two new teams, including one from Glasgow and English based RFU Championship London Scottish.However, plans for this did not come to fruition in time for the 2023 Season\nCriticism.\nThere has been a number of controversies surrounding the creation of the new league:- some argued that the gap between the Scottish Premiership and Pro14 isn't that great. For a so-called 'amateur' league, Scottish Premiership sides often played well against professional sides. Glasgow Hawks famously beating Toulouse in February 1998 a case in point.\nThe main criticism of the new league is the geographical split. No less than half the league's clubs are based in Edinburgh. There are no clubs from Scotland's biggest city, Glasgow - even though Glasgow Hawks did apply to join; and rugby union in the city markedly on the up with Glasgow Warriors regularly selling out Scotstoun Stadium and providing the Pro14 with their highest ever attendance for a final. Similarly there are no clubs from Aberdeen, Dundee or Inverness represented, although only Dundee HSFP applied to join out of the clubs from those cities. This, it is argued, does not help the game grow in Scotland.\nAnother argument is money. The initial money, capped by the Scottish Rugby Union, will only provide players with essentially a part time wage. Thus, most will need to secure other employment. Again, sceptics may point to this as not helping the players develop."

        "text": "The 2020 Major League Baseball season began on July 23 and ended on September 27 with only 60 games amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The full 162-game regular season was planned to begin on March 26, but the pandemic caused Major League Baseball (MLB) to announce on March 12 that the remainder of spring training was canceled and that the start of the regular season would be delayed by at least two weeks. On March 16, MLB announced that the season would be postponed indefinitely, following recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to restrict events of more than 50 people. This was the first time that MLB games had been put on hold since the 2001 season, when the season was paused for over a week after the September 11 attacks.\nSpring training resumed on July 1 and was rebranded as \"Summer Camp\". On July 3, the All-Star Game was canceled because of the delay to the regular season. Dodger Stadium, which was set to host the game, went on to host the 2022 All-Star Game.\nOn July 18, the Canadian federal government denied permission for the Toronto Blue Jays to play their home games at Rogers Centre in 2020 on grounds that repeated cross-border trips by both the Blue Jays and their opponents would be a major risk due to the higher spikes in COVID-19 cases in the U.S. compared to those in Canada. The Blue Jays then chose to play their home games at Sahlen Field in Buffalo, home of their Triple-A affiliate Buffalo Bisons.\nAn expanded 16-team postseason tournament began on September 29, with games of all but the first round being played at neutral sites. The World Series began on October 20 at Globe Life Field in Arlington, and ended on October 27, with the Los Angeles Dodgers defeating the Tampa Bay Rays in six games to win their first title since 1988.\nSchedule.\nThe 2020 schedule greatly differed from the normal 162-game schedule. In an effort to reduce travel, each team played only nine opponents during the regular season instead of the usual 19 or 20. Teams were scheduled to play 10 games against each of their four division opponents. The remaining 20 games of the 60-game schedule were interleague contests. To reduce travel, the interleague division match-ups were AL East vs NL East, AL Central vs NL Central, and AL West vs NL West. At 60 games, this was the shortest regular season since 1878.\nSeveral international and neutral-site games originally scheduled for the season were canceled due to COVID-19:\nMarch agreement between MLB and MLBPA.\nOn March 26, MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) reached an agreement on multiple considerations related to the start of the season being delayed, including:\nPossible schedules.\nThe indefinite delay of the season caused MLB to internally consider a number of scenarios for playing the season, as well as analysts suggesting ways it could be done. A shortened regular season, a season with many doubleheaders, and a postseason extending into late November with a World Series at an indoor or warm-weather neutral site were suggested.\nIn early April, Jeff Passan of ESPN reported that MLB was \"increasingly focused on a plan that could allow them to start the season as early as May and has the support of high-ranking federal public health officials\". The plan would have involved all 30 teams playing games with no fans in stadiums around the Phoenix metropolitan area, including Chase Field and spring training complexes. Players would have lived in isolation at local hotels.\nAnother report from \"USA Today\" baseball writer Bob Nightengale detailed another MLB proposal utilizing the Phoenix metro sites, but with the additional use of spring training sites in Florida, Marlins Park in Miami, and St. Petersburg's Tropicana Field. In addition, the 30 teams would be re-aligned for the season depending on their spring training sites into six divisions based upon their locations in Arizona and Florida and agnostic to the usual AL/NL demarcations and traditional geographic rivalries, effectively making the spring training Cactus League and Grapefruit League regular-season leagues. No interleague play would take place and the designated hitter rule would be utilized for all 30 teams, with the World Series occurring in November utilizing the larger MLB sites.\nDisagreement over plans for a shortened season.\nDuring May and June, MLB and Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) were unable to agree on a specific plan for a shortened season.\nIn mid-May the MLB owners proposed a schedule of 82 games, to begin in July, with games to be played without fans in attendance. To minimize travel, teams would play only against other teams in their geographical division, plus interleague games against teams in the corresponding division of the other league. A team would play 13 games against each division rival and six games against each team in the other league's division. Postseason play would be expanded from 10 teams to 14, with each league fielding three division winners and four wild card teams. A designated hitter would be allowed in all games. Teams would have 30-man rosters available for each game. The proposal also outlined safety measures for health of players and staff and a modified compensation plan for players.\nOn June 1, the MLBPA countered with a 114-game proposal, with a regular season running from June 30 to October 31, a November postseason, giving players the right to opt-out of participating, a salary deferral plan in the event the postseason has to be canceled due to a second wave of the virus, and a $100 million advance during the second spring training, among others.\nOwners then submitted a 76-game proposal to the players on June 8, with the regular season ending on September 27, the postseason ending in October, 75 percent prorated player salaries, and playoff pool money, among others. The MLBPA responded one day later with an 89-game plan with full prorated player salaries. The owners then sent a 72-game plan with 70 percent prorated player salaries, to which the MLBPA replied in a statement on June 13, \"Further dialogue with the league would be futile. It's time to get back to work. Tell us when and where.\" However, the week of June 15 saw the owners propose a 60-game season while MLBPA counter with a 70-game season, which on June 19 was rejected by the owners.\nAmid an increase in cases in Arizona and Florida, including positive cases among staff of the Phillies, and a Blue Jays player showing signs of symptoms, it was reported on June 19 that all spring training sites would be temporarily closed for deep cleaning, and all players would be required to test negative for COVID-19 before entering. It was then reported on June 20 that almost all MLB teams had elected to re-locate their training camps back to their home cities.\nOn June 22, hours after the MLBPA rejected the MLB's offer to play a 60-game season, MLB owners voted unanimously to impose the 60-game plan. By allowing the owners to unilaterally implement such a plan without the MLBPA, both sides retained the right to file a grievance against the other for not negotiating in good faith. On June 23, both sides agreed to health and safety protocols. Players reported to training camp July 1. Due to concerns related to the pandemic, several players chose not to play the season.\nRevised 60-game schedule.\nOn July 6, MLB released the revised schedule for the shortened 60-game season. In the new schedule, teams played 10 games against each of their four divisional opponents in three series, with an unequal number of home games against each opponent. Each team had 20 home games for division opponents.\nInterleague play comprised the other 20 games of the schedule, all against the division of the opposite league, temporarily suspending the yearly rotation of which divisions play each other. Like normal seasons in which corresponding interleague divisions play each other (e.g. 2018), teams played six games against their \"natural rival\" and three or four games against each of the other four teams in the division. However, for this year only, the Cleveland Indians were paired with the Pittsburgh Pirates instead of their normal rivals, the Cincinnati Reds, and the Detroit Tigers were paired with the Reds instead of the Pirates. This was done to reduce travel for all four teams.\nThe season started on July 23, with two games: New York Yankees at Washington Nationals and San Francisco Giants at Los Angeles Dodgers. The remaining 26 teams opened the season on July 24.\nOn July 23, MLB and MLBPA announced that the postseason would be an expanded 16-team playoff tournament for 2020 only, instead of the normal 10-team tournament. All first and second place teams in the six divisions would qualify for the playoffs. The final two spots in each league would go to the remaining teams with the best win–loss records. The teams in each league would be seeded by division winners (1–3), division runners-up (4–6), and best teams remaining (7–8). Seeding ties would be resolved by head-to-head record, intra-league record, and record in final 20 intra-league games, to remove the necessity for additional games. The first round of the playoffs would be a best-of-three series called the Wild Card Series, with all games to be played at the home of the higher seeded team. After that, the postseason would follow the usual pattern of five-game Division series, seven-game League Championship Series, and a seven-game World Series.\nPostponed games.\nCOVID-19.\nCOVID-19 outbreaks among the Miami Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals, as well as positive tests on the Cincinnati Reds, New York Mets, Oakland Athletics, and San Francisco Giants, resulted in the postponement of a total of 40 games.\nMiami received confirmation that starting pitcher José Ureña had tested positive and would not be available on July 26, but the team decided to play the third and final game of their scheduled series against the Philadelphia Phillies at the direction of Major League Baseball. After additional Miami players and coaches tested positive, MLB postponed Miami's four-game home-and-home series with the Baltimore Orioles, and Philadelphia's four-game home-and-home series with the New York Yankees, both originally scheduled from July 27 to 30. In order to allow for some flexibility in making games up, the Yankees and Orioles played two games against each other in Baltimore July 29 and 30, moving them up one week from their originally scheduled dates of August 3 and 4. The Marlins later confirmed that 21 players and coaches tested positive. The next series for both teams, Miami's home series against the Washington Nationals and Philadelphia's series at the Toronto Blue Jays, were postponed. Both series would have taken place from July 31 to August 2.\nSt. Louis had six positive tests resulting in the postponement of three games at the Milwaukee Brewers from July 31 to August 2. Four additional games, a home-and-home series against the Detroit Tigers originally scheduled for August 3 to 6, were also postponed after an additional seven positive tests were reported. After continued positive tests throughout the next week, St. Louis's three-game series against the Chicago Cubs, originally August 7 to 9, and their three-game series against the Pittsburgh Pirates, originally August 10 to 12, were postponed. A doubleheader against Detroit on August 13 which would have been made up games from August 3 and 4 was also postponed and later canceled.\nCincinnati had a player test positive resulting in the postponement of two games against Pittsburgh on August 15 and 16. Cincinnati's game against the Kansas City Royals on August 18 was postponed as well.\nThe New York Mets had a player and staff member test positive resulting in the postponement of their August 20 game against Miami and their three-game series against the New York Yankees on August 21 to 23.\nOakland had a positive test resulting in the postponement of their August 30 game against the Houston Astros. As a precaution, Oakland's three-game series against the Seattle Mariners on September 1 to 3 was postponed.\nSan Francisco had a positive test resulting in the postponement of two games against the San Diego Padres originally scheduled for September 11 and 12.\nAll postponed games were made up except for two games between the St. Louis Cardinals and Detroit Tigers, with both teams completing 58 out of 60 games. This had no bearing on the playoff teams other than seeding.\nShooting of Jacob Blake.\nPlayer protests in response to the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin resulted in the postponement of 11 games.\nThe Milwaukee Brewers announced that they would not play their August 26 game against the Cincinnati Reds in the wake of the shooting, following three NBA playoff games that were postponed the same day. Two additional games were postponed that day. Seven games on August 27 and one game on August 28 were also postponed.\nSpring training.\nSpring training for the 2020 season took place in two segments. The first segment began in late February and lasted until mid-March, abruptly ending early due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Teams began workouts and practice for spring training beginning in late February. Pitchers and catchers reported first, followed by position players a few days later. Following the MLB owners unanimous vote to impose the 60-game regular season plan, the second segment of spring training began with players reporting to training camp starting July 1.\nPrior to the start of the regular season, each team played between 18 and 24 spring training games, from February 21 to March 12 and July 18 to July 22. There were several times during spring training where a team had two different squads playing different teams simultaneously. In addition to spring training games, teams occasionally played exhibition games with non-MLB teams, such as Minor League Baseball teams, independent teams, or college teams. These exhibition games were not counted in spring training standings. Spring training ended on July 22, the day before Opening Day.\nPostseason.\nMLB announced the playoff bracket on September 15, consisting of eight teams from each league: the top two teams from each division, plus the teams from each league with the next two best records. The Wild Card Series was a best-of-three series at the home field of the higher-seeded team, while the Division Series, League Championship Series, and World Series were their normal lengths, played at neutral sites, similar to those used for both the National Basketball Association and National Hockey League playoffs, to limit the possibility of another COVID-19 outbreak that could both disrupt the schedule and affect competitive integrity. Specifically, the American League played at the San Diego Padres' Petco Park and the Los Angeles Dodgers' Dodger Stadium, while the National League played at the Texas Rangers' Globe Life Field and the Houston Astros' Minute Maid Park, all from opposite conferences, so that no teams will play at their home ballparks in the weightiest rounds to avoid unfair advantage. The World Series then took place at Globe Life Field.\nThe Milwaukee Brewers and Houston Astros became the first teams to make the postseason with a record below .500 since the 1981 Royals. Both clubs went in the regular season. The Astros became the first, and currently only, team with a record below .500 to win a playoff series, as they defeated the Minnesota Twins in the Wild Card Series and the Oakland Athletics in the Division Series, before losing the American League Championship Series to the Tampa Bay Rays. They also became the first, and currently only, team with a record below .500 to win a playoff game, as the 1981 Royals and Brewers were swept in the first rounds they played. They also became just the second team to force a game seven after being down 3–0 to the Tampa Bay Rays in the ALCS, joining only the Boston Red Sox who ended up completing the comeback against the New York Yankees in 2004.\nRule changes.\nPermanent changes announced prior to season.\nThe following changes, effective for the 2020 season, were officially announced by MLB on February 12:\nAdditionally, Rule 7.04 governing protested games was amended to read \"Protesting a game shall never be permitted, regardless of whether such complaint is based on judgement decisions by the umpire or an allegation that an umpire misapplied these rules or otherwise rendered a decision in violation of these rules.\"\nTemporary rules for shortened 2020 season.\nThe following temporary rules for the shortened 2020 season were announced on June 24. Note that some of these additional changes supersede the rule changes which were announced in February.\nThe following temporary rule was announced on July 30, to be effective on August 1.\nAwards and honors.\nAll-MLB Team.\nPlayers are selected through fan votes (50%) and votes from a panel of experts (50%). The winners are selected based on merit, with no set number of nominees per position and no distinction between leagues.\nUniforms.\nOn January 25, 2019, MLB announced that Nike would become the new exclusive uniform supplier for all MLB teams, under a 10-year deal beginning in 2020. Fanatics would oversee production of on-field and retail MLB uniforms licensed by Nike. Under Armour backed out of its existing supply agreement as a cost-cutting measure.\nAnniversaries and special events.\nWholesale changes\nArizona tweaked their uniforms, including removing the darker away uniforms and the diamond pattern on the uniforms.\nCincinnati added a new alternate jersey and a new spring training jersey.\nMilwaukee introduced new uniforms, including a return to the ball-in-glove logo used as their primary logo from 1978 to 1993. They also switched out their gold color to yellow.\nMinnesota added a new alternate uniform, utilizing its powder blue 1973–1986 road uniform design.\nPittsburgh brought back the script \"Pittsburgh\" from the 1990s on new alternate and road uniforms, along with a gold outlined \"P\" on their caps.\nTexas introduced a new powder blue jersey along with a powder blue hat. It also changed the \"Texas\" wordmark to \"Rangers\" wordmark on the white jersey and revealed a new red hat with the state of Texas on it with \"TX.\"\nToronto added a new alternate based on its 1979–1988 powder blue road jerseys.\nWashington added two new alternate hats and one alternate white jersey.\nSan Diego changed its primary colors from navy blue to brown and gold, the team's primary colors from 1969 to 1984.\nSt. Louis made changes to its logo as it appears on the caps.\nThrowbacks\nThe Cardinals and Royals wore Negro leagues throwbacks September 22. The Cardinals wore 1930 St. Louis Stars uniforms, and the Royals wore 1945 Kansas City Monarchs uniforms.\nVenues.\nThis is the Texas Rangers' first season at Globe Life Field, replacing Globe Life Park in Arlington where they played from 1994 to 2019. Their first game was July 24 against the Colorado Rockies.\nThe Miami Marlins converted Marlins Park from a natural grass surface to Shaw Sports B1K artificial turf and the field's fences will be moved in closer.\nThe Atlanta Braves' SunTrust Park was renamed Truist Park after SunTrust Banks merged with BB&amp;T Bank to make Truist Financial.\nTemporary relocation of the Toronto Blue Jays.\nOn July 18, the Canadian federal government denied the Toronto Blue Jays exceptions to the \"Quarantine Act\" to play regular season home games at Rogers Centre this season. Although they were allowed to conduct training camp with stricter protocols than those mandated by MLB, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Marco Mendicino cited that repeated cross-border travel by players would carry a major risk due to the higher number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. Mendicino did not rule out the permission being granted for postseason games, depending on the status of the pandemic in the U.S. by then, however the Blue Jays would not have any home postseason games.\nOn July 20, the Pittsburgh Pirates offered the use of PNC Park as a site for Blue Jays home games. However, health officials in Pennsylvania denied permission for this arrangement, citing concerns over additional travel to and from Pittsburgh amid an increase in local cases.\nOn July 24, the Blue Jays announced that they would play the majority of their home games at Sahlen Field in Buffalo, New York, home of the Jays' AAA affiliate, the Buffalo Bisons. The Jays' first game in Buffalo was August 11 against the Miami Marlins. The Jays' first two home series against the Washington Nationals and Philadelphia Phillies were relocated to the visiting teams' venues, Nationals Park and Citizens Bank Park, respectively, with the Jays as designated home team. However, the Phillies series was postponed and made up in Buffalo.\nBroadcast rights.\nTelevision.\nNational.\nThis is the seventh year of the current eight-year deals with Fox, ESPN, and TBS. Fox was to televise the MLB at Field of Dreams game on August 13. FS1 televised games on Tuesday nights and on Saturdays both during the afternoon and night. ESPN televised games on its flagship telecast \"Sunday Night Baseball\" as well as Monday and Wednesday nights. Fox and \"ESPN Sunday Night Baseball\" telecasts were exclusive; all other national telecasts were subject to local blackout.\nTBS televised one AL Wild Card Series, both American League Division Series matchups and the American League Championship Series. ESPN televised seven of the eight Wild Card Series with live look-ins and alternate broadcasts on ESPN+. On September 28, it was announced that ABC would broadcast at least four of ESPN's Wild Card Series games, marking the first time a national MLB game had aired on the network since 1995 (via the ill-fated \"The Baseball Network\" arrangement). FS1 and MLB Network will televise both National League Division Series matchups. Fox and FS1 televised the National League Championship Series, and the World Series was on Fox for the 21st straight year.\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on production.\nIn order to reduce avoidable travel and the amount of personnel on-site for each game, most MLB broadcasters commentated away games remotely from either their broadcaster's studio, or their home stadium's broadcast booths. MLB safety protocols mandated remote broadcasts for away games on television, but radio broadcasters were allowed to be present on-site for away games if they so chose. Some teams had their commentators on-site for home games only, and called away games from their studio.\nFurthermore, the home team's local television rightsholder served as the host broadcaster for each game, providing a neutral video feed to media partners (including the away team's local rightsholder, and in some cases, a national broadcaster), which added commentary, graphics, and other surrounding coverage for their audience. MLB Network assisted with providing and using existing infrastructure for this arrangement. Audio from Sony Interactive Entertainment's \"\" video game franchise was used as artificial crowd noise for all games, and was played over the stadiums' audio systems on-site.\nFox announced plans to use augmented reality \"virtual fans\" in its games, while ESPN leveraged experience from its remote broadcasts of KBO League games over the suspended pre-season.\nThe pandemic also led to changes in broadcast arrangements for several teams:\nRetirements.\nThe following players retired during the 2020 season and before the start of 2021 campaign:\nRetired numbers.\nDue to the delayed start of the season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the following retirement ceremonies have been postponed. They had been rescheduled to either 2021 or 2022.\nMajor League Baseball teams revenue losses for 2020.\nFor 2020 \"Team Marketing Report\" calculated $5 billion in game day losses for Major League Baseball as a result of not having fans in attendance."

It was the first appearance of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics format continued to use the aggregation format. Each nation entered a team of eight gymnasts or up to three individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The four apparatus that would become standard (floor, balance beam, uneven bars, and vault) were all used in the same Games for the first time. \nNo separate finals were contested.\nFor each individual exercise, five judges gave scores from 0 to 10 in one-tenth point increments. The top and bottom scores were discarded and the remaining three scores averaged to give the exercise total. Thus, exercise scores ranged from 0 to 10, apparatus scores from 0 to 20, and individual totals from 0 to 80. \nFor the vault, each competitor had two tries for each of the compulsory and voluntary vaults with the better score to count. For the other three apparatus exercises, the competitor had the option to make a second try only on the compulsory exercise—with the second attempt counting regardless of whether it was better than the first. For both compulsory and voluntary floor exercises, and voluntary exercises in the non-floor, non-vault apparatuses, only one attempt could be made."

        "title": "PGA Championship Golf 1999 Edition",
        "text": "PGA Championship Golf 1999 Edition is a 1999 golf video game developed by Headgate Studios and published by Sierra Sports for Microsoft Windows. The game includes eight golf courses and a golf swing method known as TrueSwing, which uses the movement of the computer mouse to simulate a golf swing in real-time as the player makes the shot. Also included is the ReadyPlay feature, allowing golfers in a multiplayer group to play at their own pace without waiting for others to finish their turn. The game was praised for its variety, including its TrueSwing and ReadyPlay features, although its golf commentary was criticized. The game was followed by a sequel, \"PGA Championship Golf 2000\".\nGameplay.\n\"PGA Championship Golf 1999 Edition\" includes seven real-life courses: Black Diamond Ranch, Coeur d'Alene Resort, Pasatiempo, Pete Dye Golf Club, Prince Course, Royal Birkdale, and Sahalee Country Club. A fictional eighth course, Jocassee Shoals, is also featured. The real courses each start with a short film which serves as an overview of the course. The Course Architect is a feature which allows the player to create custom golf courses, with options that include hills, valleys, trees, and sound effects.\n\"PGA Championship Golf 1999 Edition\" features 12 game modes, including four-ball, match, scramble, and skins. A practice mode is also featured. The game includes professional golfer Tom Lehman and several default golfers as playable characters. Additional golfers can be custom-made by the player, with selectable options such as gender, skin tone, hair, and hats. Computer-controlled golfers can be set to gradually learn from the actual player's golfing and thus become more challenging for the player. The player can choose to let a caddie select the golf clubs, and candies can also track the statistics of the player's shots to gradually learn which clubs work best in certain scenarios. Rather than using an aim mechanism, the player must rotate the golfer's position to aim for the hole. The game includes a traditional three-click golf swing method, as well as the TrueSwing method, which uses the movement of the computer mouse to simulate the golf swing in real-time as the player makes the shot. On the green, the player can use a ground-based grid to aid with putting. The player can also make use of mulligans and gimmes, and can select post-shot animations, such as falling to the ground in frustration at a poor shot. The game features golf commentary by Mark Lye and Grant Boone. Various camera angles are featured as well.\nMultiplayer options include modem and LAN, and WON.net was also an option at the time of release. The ReadyPlay feature allows each golfer in a multiplayer group to play at their own pace, rather than waiting for each golfer to finish their turn.\nDevelopment and release.\nIn July 1998, Sierra Sports announced an agreement with PGA Interactive to create \"PGA Championship Golf 1999 Edition\", scheduled for release that October. The game was developed by Headgate Studios. The game's director was Vance Cook, who also served as a designer and software engineer. Cook, who founded Headgate Studios, had previously worked on the \"Links\" golf games and Sierra's \"\".\nTo replicate the courses, Cook and his team would survey each real course, then they would fly an airplane 1,000 to 2,000 feet above the course and take aerial photographs. The survey data and photographs were then put through the process of photogrammetry. Following that, a photographer would visit the courses to take pictures of trees, bushes, ground textures, and the clubhouses. The pictures were then taken to Headgate's office in Salt Lake City, Utah, where the courses were then created. Each course took three to four months to complete, with a team of three or four people. The Jocassee Shoals course was created using the Course Architect. The golfers consist of 400 animated motions and are made of up to 20,000 polygons. The game's TrueSwing was previously featured in \"Front Page Sports: Golf\", and was enhanced for \"PGA Championship Golf 1999 Edition\".\nOn May 20, 1999, Sierra Sports announced the completion of the game. In North America, copies of \"PGA Championship Golf 1999 Edition\" began shipping in late May 1999, and were expected to be on sale by June 1. The game was released for Microsoft Windows. The Sierra Sports Golf Association, a sports league created by WON.net, hosted various online golf events for players of the game. In addition, players using the Course Architect would post their custom-made courses online to share with others. As of July 1999, more than 35 custom courses had been posted on WON.net. By September 1999, the game had been released in the United Kingdom. By August 2000, the game had been re-released in the U.K as part of the Sierra Originals budget label.\nReception.\nThe game received favorable reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings.\nSome critics considered the gameplay inferior to the \"Links\", \"Jack Nicklaus\", and \"PGA Tour\" series, although Ewan MacDonald of \"Eurogamer\" preferred it over the \"Links\" series and considered it one of the better golf games available. Mike Snider of \"USA Today\" called the game \"intriguing, but not of championship stature.\" William Abner of \"Computer Games Strategy Plus\" called the game \"an enigma,\" writing, \"It has the best swing method in the industry, a powerful course designer, addictive gameplay, and yet it feels unfinished.\" Brett Todd of \"Computer Gaming World\" considered it a forgettable game.\nThe graphics received some praise, although they were also considered inferior to the \"Links\" and \"Jack Nicklaus\" games. Macdonald called the game a \"strange hybrid\" of 3D and 2D graphics. Gordon Goble of \"CNET Gamecenter\" considered the graphics realistic but stated that they had a \"dull, almost drab look\" that was lacking in color. Todd considered the courses to be \"nicely drawn, but plain,\" and criticized their similarities to each other, as did Paul Rosano of \"Hartford Courant\". Martin Korda of \"PC Zone\" called the graphics \"smooth, if not spectacular, although it's a shame that the crowd are so static; they can also stand right in front of your golfer when he takes a shot, which is a little sloppy.\" Chris Buxton of \"PC Gamer\" (U.K.) criticized the stagnant and \"awful-looking\" spectators, while Abner wrote that they \"are never watching the action. Instead, they are staring off into oblivion, apparently trying to get a good look at the blimp overhead.\" Steve Butts of \"IGN\" stated that although the spectators are rendered in 2D, they \"look very, very real.\"\nTodd criticized the cartoonish golfers, calling them \"little more than animated mannequins, devoid of any facial features.\" Rosano stated that the golfers were \"just about the goofiest around,\" calling them \"awkward and cartoonish.\" Butts noted that most of the golfers' facial designs looked alike and that \"the women are a little weird looking.\" Snider wrote that the Tom Lehman character \"falls short of his likeness\". Buxton noted an issue in which \"the player animation stutters, especially when there's more than one golfer on screen.\" Goble noted that golfers were \"capable of warping from one location to another--a phenomenon that may save time but looks totally bizarre.\" Marc Saltzman of \"GamePro\" criticized the game's \"exaggerated\" post-shot player animations, stating that in one instance, the golfer \"looked like he was having a heart attack\". Stephen Poole of \"GameSpot\" wrote \"what little the game lacks in visual appeal it more than makes up for with an excellent interface, lifelike golfer animations, and very good ball physics.\" Other critics were mixed on whether the game physics were superior to the \"Links\" series.\nSome praised the sound, although the commentary was generally criticized. Todd referred to the commentators as \"Nostradamus and Jeane Dixon\" because of their \"uncanny knack for predicting where your ball is going to drop.\" Goble wrote that \"much of the shot-making drama is negated by announcers who broadcast your ball's final resting spot almost immediately after you've swung your club.\" Rob Smolka of \"PC Gamer\" (U.S.) criticized the commentators for being \"extremely repetitive\" and \"omniscient\", and stated that their ability to essentially predict where the ball will land \"really removes any drama from those close-call shots.\" Smolka further stated that the commentators \"become babbling idiots around the green, congratulating you on poorly played chips and pitches, and at times misleading you on which direction your ball will break on putts.\" Abner disliked the commentary and its inaccuracies, writing that the commentators \"have a peculiar notion as to what constitutes a good shot.\" Abner also criticized the commentators' \"enhanced future seeing ability,\" which \"kills any tension that watching your shot skirt with trouble can provide.\"\nHouse considered the commentary to be \"without doubt, the weakest and most annoying part of the game,\" writing that the commentators often repeated each other's comments and that they had limited vocabulary which quickly became tedious. \"PC Accelerator\" also stated that the commentary quickly becomes annoying. Macdonald called the commentary \"commendable\", accurate, and often informative, while Buxton wrote that the commentators occasionally gave poor advice. Chris Capell of Sports Gaming Network criticized the commentary for being repetitive and incorrect, but otherwise stated that it was of \"high quality, and very authentic.\" Saltzman wrote that the commentary and crowd reaction \"is often inconsistent with what's happening on the course,\" noting one instance in which the crowd \"cheered wildly when I hit the ball into the trees.\" Goble stated that although the spectators' \"cheers and groans sound very authentic, it is very strange that you don't hear a peep until your ball has come to a full stop.\"\nCritics praised the ReadyPlay feature. House called it an \"enormous innovation\" and wrote, \"No longer do you have to sit idly by while the other three golfers in your foursome hack away.\" Abner called it \"both a blessing and a curse,\" stating that it speeds up the gameplay but that other players occasionally \"stand in the way of a shot making it impossible to see where you are hitting; this is especially frustrating when on the green.\" Smolka also acknowledged that it speeds up the gameplay, but that it \"can be a bit disconcerting - especially when you're the first to reach the green and, while you're lining up your putt, a stray golf ball comes flying right at you!\"\nThe game's variety was praised, as well as the TrueSwing method. Abner called the TrueSwing \"the biggest selling point\", while stating that the three-click method was \"far too easy to use and simply feels tacked on.\" Praising the TrueSwing method, House wrote that the game \"achieves what I had begun to think of as the unattainable Holy Grail of golf simulation\". Rosano wrote, \"The feel of the mouse swing is truly incredible, way ahead of the competition.\" Capell stated that the TrueSwing was \"a surprisingly natural and easy method to pick up, and has depth you wouldn't believe.\"\nThe Course Architect was considered easy to use, although Butts considered its interface to be overwhelmed by options. While some critics praised the course designer, others expressed disappointment that it does not allow the creation of holes in which the ball has to travel across water. Others noted that the program would freeze or crash. In his September 1999 review of the game, Rosano wrote that following the recent release of a patch, \"the architect has repeatedly crashed at the beginning of a new session, something Sierra must address immediately.\" In addition, some critics noted issues in which the game would crash or freeze when playing on WON.net, although Goble noted that the website's support of the game \"is still in its early stages and should improve in the future.\" The issue was ongoing as of November 1999.\nThe game sold 48,105 copies in the U.S. by April 2000."

        "title": "2019–20 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2019–20 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 2019–20 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Hoyas, led by third-year head coach Patrick Ewing, played their home games at the Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., as members of the Big East Conference. They lost to St. John's in the first round of the 2020 Big East men's basketball tournament, finished with a record of 15–17 overall and 5–13 in Big East play, and had no postseason play.\nPrevious season.\nThe Hoyas finished the 2018–19 season at 19–14, 9–9 in Big East play, to finish in sixth place in the conference. As the No. 6 seed in the Big East tournament, they lost in the first round to Seton Hall. Invited to the National Invitation Tournament, they lost in the first round to Harvard. Georgetown finished the season with a winning record, a non-losing conference record, and an invitation to a postseason tournament, all for the first time since 2014–15.\nRoster.\n\"Notes: 1) Chuma Azinge was a recruited walk-on. 2) On December 2, 2019, Patrick Ewing announced that James Akinjo and Josh LeBlanc were no longer a part of the team and would transfer. 3) On December 13, 2019, Galen Alexander and Myron Gardner announced that they had left the team and would transfer.\"\nSeason recap.\nIn addition to sophomore forward Antwan Walker – dismissed from the team in October 2018, he subsequently had transferred to Rhode Island – Georgetown had lost five players since the conclusion of the previous season: guard Greg Malinowski, guard/forward Kaleb Johnson, forward Trey Mourning, and center Jessie Govan all had graduated in 2019, and freshman forward Grayson Carter had transferred to UT Arlington in search of greater playing time after a single season as a Hoya. However, a core of veteran players – sophomore James Akinjo at point guard, senior Jagan Mosely, junior Jahvon Blair, and sophomore Mac McClung at guard, and junior Jamorko Pickett and sophomore Josh LeBlanc at forward — returned. Senior forward George Muresan, the son of former NBA player Gheorghe Muresan, made the team as a walk-on for the fourth straight season. Sophomore guard Jaden Robinson also returned, making the team as a walk-on for the second straight year.\nAn addition for 2019–2020 was center Ömer Yurtseven, a transfer from North Carolina State who joined the team as a redshirt junior after sitting out the previous season in accordance with NCAA transfer rules. Also arriving were guard Terrell Allen, a graduate transfer from Central Florida who had spent a season at Drexel before two years at UCF, and junior small forward Galen Alexander; recruited out of high school, Alexander had signed with LSU, was dismissed from the team there without ever playing a game amid allegations that he had fired paintballs at other students, and subsequently spent two years at Jones County Junior College. Five freshmen — centers Timothy Ighoefe, Qudus Wahab, and Malcolm Wilson, forward Myron Gardner, and recruited walk-on Chuma Azinge, a guard — rounded out the team.\nThere were nine returning players from the previous season including four of that year's five starters, freshman standouts Akinjo, LeBlanc, and McClung among them, as well as Yurtseven, replacing the departed Govan and Alexander.\n2019 Bahamas Foreign Tour.\nUnder National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules, the Hoyas were allowed to make an overseas preseason trip to play exhibition games against foreign teams once every four years, and the 2019–2020 team followed up recent trips to China in August 2011 and Italy in August 2015 with a trip to the Bahamas — dubbed the \"2019 Bahamas Foreign Tour\" — from August 10 to 17. The Hoyas held 10 team practices prior to the tour, the number permitted before an overseas tour by NCAA rules. Before departing, the team characterized the Bahamas visit as a \"business trip;\" Patrick Ewing said that he wanted to use the trip to test different line-ups and gain insight into which of his players were sharing the ball and playing as a team, while James Akinjo and Mac McClung both expressed a desire to get to know their new teammates and learn how best to work together with them on the court, Josh LeBlanc said he wanted to focus on ball-sharing and team play, and Ömer Yurtseven planned to use the Bahamas games to get back into his competitive basketball routine after sitting out the 2018–2019 season.\nDuring the Bahamas tour, Georgetown played three exhibition games against local professional and international teams as part of the \"Bahamas Basketball Federation (BBF) Summer of Thunder 2019\" event. The games took place at Kendal G. L. Isaacs National Gymnasium at Atlantis Paradise Island in Nassau using International Basketball Federation (\"Fédération Internationale de Basketball\" or FIBA) rules which included the new NCAA three-point arc distance of , a 24-second shot clock, a FIBA-compliant basketball that differed from the regulation NCAA ball, and games divided into four 10-minute quarters with five-minute overtime periods. There were no overtime periods as the Hoyas won all three games by wide margins, scoring at least 91 points in each game and twice scoring over 100 points. While in Nassau, the Hoyas also hosted a youth basketball clinic attended by 50 Bahamian children, met with Chargé d'Affaires Stephanie Bowers of the United States Embassy, and attended a luncheon with Georgetown fans who had traveled to the Bahamas to see the games.\nNonconference schedule.\nIn October, the Big East's coaches picked Georgetown to finish sixth in the 10-team conference in their annual preseason poll. Akinjo — who the previous season had become the seventh Hoya to be selected as Big East Freshman of the Year — was selected to the Preseason All-Big East Second Team, and Yurtseven — who had averaged 13.5 points and 6.7 rebounds per game during his last season of play in 2017–2018 with North Carolina State — won Preseason All-Big East Honorable Mention. In a preseason evaluation of the Big East for 2019–2020, \"Sports Illustrated\" picked the Hoyas to finish fifth in the Big East and identified the Georgetown squad as a solid mid-tier team in the conference with the potential to make a surprise run at the conference championship.\nThe Hoyas opened the season on November 6 at Capital One Arena by shooting only 30 percent from the field against Mount St. Mary's in the first half, falling behind 37–25 at halftime. In the second half they shot 65.6 percent and finished with a 20–1 run, winning 81–68. Ömer Yursteven had a double-double in his Georgetown debut with 20 points on 7–for–9 shooting and 12 rebounds, while James Akinjo also finished with 20 points and Mac McClung scored 16. Georgetown then began play in the Empire Classic, meeting Central Arkansas in an unbracketed game at Capital One Arena and defeating the Bears behind another Yurtseven double-double (17 points and 15 rebounds), 13 points by Jagan Moseley, and 10 by Jamorko Pickett.\nGeorgetown made its fourth appearance in five seasons in the Gavitt Tipoff Games, an annual series of meetings between Big East and Big Ten Conference teams begun in 2015. In the 2019 edition, the Hoyas faced Penn State at Capital One Arena. Georgetown had won the past six meetings between the schools and had not lost at home to Penn State since 1972; their first loss of the season was to the Nittany Lions. With McClung shooting just 1-for-7 from the field — following a 1-for-10 performance against Central Arkansas five days earlier — and Nittany Lions sophomore guard Myreon Jones scoring a game-high and career-high 21 points, the Hoyas fell behind early by as many as 18 points and lost by 15, dropping their season record to 2–1, their Gavit Tipoff Games all-time record to 1–3, and their record against Power Five teams during Patrick Ewing's tenure to 1–3. Yurtseven had his third straight double-double with 16 points and 10 rebounds, and Akinjo added 13 points in a losing cause.\nGeorgetown completed its season-opening four-game homestand by returning to action in the Empire Classic, hosting Georgia State in another unbracketed game, and the Hoyas won with a game-high 25 points, going 11-for-11 from the foul line, while Yurtseven continued his string of double-doubles with 15 points and 13 rebounds, Josh LeBlanc scored 12 points, Akinjo added 11, and Jamorko Pickett finished with 10. The Hoyas then traveled to Madison Square Garden in New York City to begin the bracketed portion of the Empire Classic with a meeting in the semifinals with their first ranked opponent of the season, No. 22 Texas. The crowd — which included former Georgetown and National Basketball Association great Alonzo Mourning and Brooklyn Nets centers Jarrett Allen and Kevin Durant — welcomed former New York Knicks star Ewing back to Madison Square Garden, his home court for most of his professional playing career, by chanting its support both for Georgetown and for Ewing, who told the press post-game, \"It felt like back in my Knick days.\" Georgetown trailed 42–37 at halftime and 52–50 with 13:42 left to play, but then the Hoyas went on a 12–0 run — including a dunk by Qudus Wahab that gave Georgetown its first lead of the second half at 54–52 — to take a 62–52 lead with 9:49 remaining on the way to an upset 82–66 win. McClung scored 19 points, Jamorko Pickett added 15, James Akinjo finished with 14, and Yurtseven — whose double-double streak finally ended — had 10. The Hoyas held Texas to 37 percent shooting from the field and forced the Longhorns to commit 12 turnovers. During the second half, Georgetown outshot Texas from the field 57.7 to 22.2 percent and converted a 19-11 first-half rebounding deficit into a 34–28 rebounding advantage by game's end. It was Georgetown's third win over a Top 25 team during Ewing's tenure as head coach.\nThe following evening, Georgetown advanced to the Empire Classic championship game to face No. 1 Duke. It was the first collegiate meeting between Ewing and Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski. With a boisterous crowd again cheering Ewing and Georgetown, the Hoyas outrebounded the Blue Devils and played a good transition game, pulling out to an early lead of 9–2 and then countering Duke comeback runs with scoring runs of their own to post leads of 22–12 and then 29–18, their largest of the game, with 6:11 left in the first half. They did not score a field goal during the final six minutes of the first half, however, and the Blue Devils came back to tie the game 33–33 at halftime. Seven seconds into the second half, Duke broke the tie to take a lead it never relinquished; although the Hoyas outshot the Blue Devils from the field 50.9 to 41.5 percent for the game, two Duke guards — sophomore Tre Jones and freshman Cassius Stanley, who together had scored only three points before halftime — combined for 31 second-half points. Ewing, incensed at what he felt were a number of erroneous foul calls against his players, limiting playing time for McClung and Yurtseven, stormed onto the court to protest halfway through the second half and was called for a technical foul, and Duke went on to win, 81–73. Yurtseven, who had taken no shots in the first half, scored 21 points after halftime to lead Georgetown scoring for the game, while the only other Hoya to score in double figures, James Akinjo, finished with 19 points. The win was Krzyzewski's 1,138th as a head coach and a record 218th win for him (against 34 losses) in games in which Duke was ranked No. 1, exceeding the 217-win record of John Wooden, who was 217–11 while UCLA was No. 1.\nGeorgetown suffered a setback eight days later when they finished November with an upset loss at home at the hands of UNC Greensboro in which James Akinjo scored 12 points, Yurtseven narrowly missed a double-double with 10 points and nine rebounds, and Jamorko Pickett finished with eight rebounds. Georgetown's record dropped to 4–3. On December 2 Ewing announced that both James Akinjo and Josh LeBlanc would not play for Georgetown again and would transfer. On the same day, news broke that a Georgetown student and her roommate had filed restraining orders against LeBlanc, Galen Alexander, and Myron Gardner on November 5 and 12, alleging \"sexual harassment and assault\" by Gardner on September 15, a burglary of their apartment by LeBlanc, Alexander, and Gardner on September 16, and subsequent threats of bodily harm against both women by LeBlanc during the week following the alleged burglary, and that campus police and the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia were investigating the allegations; Akinjo was not implicated in any of the complaints. Alexander and Gardner remained with the team, but Georgetown lost two of its top five scorers, one of them its starting point guard. \"Last year, they were part of the heart and soul of our team,\" Ewing said two days later.\nWith a depleted roster, Georgetown made a road trip to play Oklahoma State and SMU. In the Oklahoma State game — part of the first edition of the annual Big East-Big 12 Battle, which pitted Big East schools against those of the Big 12 Conference — Terrell Allen took over as starting point guard and the Hoyas won despite 29 points, six rebounds, and six assists by Cowboys senior guard Lindy Waters III. The Hoyas built an early lead, lost it early in the second half, but came from behind for the with a season-high 33 points by Mac McClung — Ewing called it \"one of his best games as a Hoya\" — 19 points and nine rebounds by Ömer Yurtseven, a season-high 15 points and five assists by Allen, and a 43–29 team rebounding performance, including 25–7 in the second half. Three nights later against undefeated SMU — the final game of a home-and-home series between the schools begun the previous season — Jahvon Blair came off the bench to tie his career high with 21 points, McClung contributed 19 points and seven assists, Yurtseven also scored 19, and Jamorko Pickett added 11 as Georgetown improved its record to 6–3 with a second consecutive win. Galen Alexander and Myron Gardner played in both games, but on December 13 both of them announced their departure from the team and intention to transfer from Georgetown, Alexander blaming Georgetown for failing to support him against what he claimed were false charges against him in the alleged burglary case. The loss of Alexander and Gardner left the team extremely shorthanded for the season, with only nine scholarship players remaining on the roster. Ewing told his remaining players that the team still had the talent to put together a successful season, but for the remainder of the season he was forced to play his remaining starters for long stretches with very little rest during games and give walk-ons greater playing team when turning to his depleted bench.\nThe annual game the previous year between Georgetown and Syracuse — longtime rivals in the original Big East Conference of 1979–2013 — had ended amid speculation that the schools would not play again in the near future because the Atlantic Coast Conference's decision to go to a 20-game conference schedule in 2019–2020 would make it too difficult for the Orange to schedule Georgetown. However, the teams continued the series ans, a week after defeating SMU and the day after Alexander and Gardner departed, Georgetown concluded the non-conference portion of their season with a four-game homestand at Capital One Arena that opened against Syracuse. It was the 95th meeting of the schools and the 80th called by Georgetown radio broadcaster Rich Chvotkin, and it drew Georgetown's biggest home crowd of the season, including Washington Nationals starting pitcher Max Scherzer. Displeased with the officiating, the Syracuse bench was assessed a technical foul when it protested a blocking foul called against the Orange midway through the first half, and late in the second half injured Syracuse sophomore guard Jalen Carey was ejected from the game for tripping Terrell Allen while Allen was playing near the Orange's bench. Georgetown committed 14 fouls to Syracuse's 24 and shot 31 free throws to Syracuse's nine; they also outperformed Syracuse 14–5 in offensive rebounds and 16–5 in second-chance points, and although Syracuse sophomore guard Buddy Boeheim scored 25 points, Georgetown won 89–79 in Ewing's first coaching victory over Syracuse. Playing 35 minutes 45 seconds, Mac McClung scored 26 points and Ömer Yurtseven contributed 19 points and nine rebounds in 34 minutes, while Jagan Moseley finished with 16 points in 36:46 of play and Terrell Allen with 14 in 37:35. With Georgetown's bench depleted, walk-on George Muresan came in to play for six minutes. While Georgetown improved to 7–3, Syracuse dropped to 5–5 on the season, its worst 10-game start in head coach Jim Boeheim's 44 years as head coach. After the game, Boeheim told the press that he thought that the departure of Akinjo, LeBlanc, Alexander, and Gardner actually had improved the Georgetown team, saying that Akinjo \"wouldn't pass the ball to anybody and just shot it every time...They've got seven guys who are as good as anybody's, and two guys [who left the team] weren't really contributing at all and another guy [Akinjo] was just throwing the ball up all the time.\"\nGeorgetown finished both its non-conference schedule for the year and its homestand with games against UMBC, Samford, and American, defeating all three by 20 points or more. Against UMBC, Yurtseven had a double-double with 22 points — a season high — and 13 rebounds, shooting 11-for-14 (78.6 percent) from the field and blocking three shots, while Jamorko Pickett scored 15, Jahvon Blair came off the bench to score 12, and Qudus Wahab backed up Yursteven at center by narrowly missing a double-double with 10 points and nine rebounds, both career highs for him. In the Samford game, Yurtseven had another double-double, with 32 points and 17 rebounds — both career highs — while Mac McClung scored 25 points and had five assists and a career-high seven rebounds, Jamorko Pickett added 14 points and six rebounds, Jahvon Blair finished with 11 points and six rebounds, and Terrell Allen had seven assists. A week later against American, Yurtseven scored 17 points and grabbed eight rebounds, while Jahvon Blair finished with 14 points and six rebounds, Terrell Allen added 14 points and five assists, and Jamorko Pickett had nine points and seven rebounds. American senior guard Sa'eed Nelson accidentally poked Mac McClung in the eye late in the first half, forcing McClung to miss the rest of the game.\nGeorgetown finished non-conference play having overcome the loss of four players to win all six games they had played since the departure of Akinjo and LeBlanc, posting a record of 10–3 against non-conference opponents for the second season in a row, and defeating three opponents from the Power Five conferences. However, the non-conference portion of the season ended amid concerns that Georgetown's lack of depth after December's scandals and transfers would hurt the team in Big East play.\nConference schedule.\nGeorgetown opened its Big East conference schedule on the road with a New Year's Eve game at Providence. Still nursing his injured eye, Mac McClung missed the game. In the first half the Friars held the Hoyas to the fewest points they had scored in a half all season and jumping out to a 54-23 halftime lead. After halftime Georgetown held Providence to 22 second-half points, tying the Friars' season low in a half, but their six-game winning streak came to an end with a 76–60 loss to the Friars. Ömer Yurtseven had a double-double with 14 points and 10 rebounds, and Terrell Allen and Jahvon Blair each scored 10 points. Another loss followed at Seton Hall three days later in the first game of 2020, when the Pirates pulled out to a double-digit lead with seven minutes left in the first half, increased it to 17 points at halftime, and never let the Hoyas get closer than 11 points in the second half, rolling to a 78–62 win. With just over three minutes to play, McClung — who had returned to action after missing the conference opener — and Pirates redshirt senior guard Quincy McKnight exchanged words, leading to a pushing and shoving match among several players that resulted in the officials assessing technical fouls on McClung and McKnight and ejecting from the game four Hoyas and two Pirates who had left their respective benches to join the fracas. McClung finished with 20 points, and Jamorko Pickett just missed a double-double with 10 points and nine rebounds. The loss dropped Georgetown to 10–5 overall and 0–2 in Big East play.\nOn January 8, Georgetown played its conference home opener, facing St. John's at Capital One Arena. This time, the Hoyas had a dominating first half in which Mac McClung scored 21 points and Georgetown jumped out to a double-digit lead with 14:05 to play in the half and led 53–26 at halftime on the way to an 87–66 victory. McClung finished with 24 points, Jamorko Pickett and Ömer Yurtseven\nboth had a double-doubles — Pickett with 18 points and 11 rebounds as well as four blocked shots and Yurtseven with 10 points and 11 rebounds — Terrell Allen added 16 points and five steals, and Jagan Mosely contributed 12 points, six rebounds, and seven assists. The Hoyas then went on the road again to meet their first ranked conference opponent of the year, No. 16 Villanova, in a game played at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. The Wildcats made 10 three-pointers in their first 12 baskets, and, although Georgetown shot 50 percent from the field to keep the first half close, Villanova led 39–36 at halftime. By the time the Wildcats pulled out to a 56–49 lead in the second half, Villanova sophomore forward Saddiq Bey — never before noted for any particular three-point prowess — was having a career game, carrying his team by going 9-for-12 (75 percent) from the floor, including seven three-pointers, while the rest of the Wildcats had shot a combined 9-for-30 (30 percent). Bey finished shooting 10-for-15 (66.7 percent) from the field — including 8-for-10 from three-point range — and sinking five free throws to score a career-high 33 points. In contrast, the Hoyas as a team shot only 5-for-16 (31.3 percent) from beyond the arc, and Villanova prevailed 80–66, the Wildcats' eighth win in nine games. Qudus Wahab came off the bench to lead the Hoyas with 13 points, while Jamorko Pickett finished with 12 and Ömer Yurtseven and Terrell Allen each scored 10. The Hoyas fell to 11–6 on the season and a 1–3 start in conference play.\nGeorgetown returned to Washington for a two-game homestand that began with a game against another ranked team, No. 25 Creighton. Mac McClung and Terrell Allen both were ill and had not practiced in three days, but both nonetheless played. The Hoyas shot 51.7 percent from the field for the game and 18-for-32 (56.3 percent) in the second half, and they out-rebounded the Bluejays 41–29. Creighton, however, dominated in three-point shooting, connecting on 13 of 32 shots (40.6 percent) from three-point range while the Hoyas sank just five of 15 shots (33.3 percent) from beyond the arc. Creighton clung to a 37–36 lead at halftime and increased its lead to 45–40 with 17:08 remaining in the game, but the Hoyas then went on an 13–2 scoring run to take a 53–47 lead with 13:02 left to play. Georgetown held the lead for the rest of the game — although Creighton used an 8–0 run of its own to close to 70–69 with 3:49 left — and upset the Bluejays 83–80. Ömer Yurtseven finished with 20 points and 13 rebounds for his ninth double-double of the season and second in Big East play, giving him team-leading season averages of 16.5 points and 9.7 rebounds per game. Mac McClung scored 19 points, Jagan Mosely — who played the entire 40 minutes of the game — finished with 13, and Jahvon Blair came off the bench to add 12. Terrell Allen, who collapsed with an attack of nausea with 19 seconds left to play, scored 10 points. The victory snapped a five-game Georgetown losing streak against the Bluejays, and it was Ewing's first win over Creighton as head coach in five tries. Creighton lost for the first time in the 2019–2020 season in a game in which it scored 70 or more points. Georgetown was unable to develop any momentum off its win, however, losing its next two games, to Marquette at Capital One Arena — in a game in which Marquette senior guard Markus Howard scored 42 points — and at Xavier. Against Marquette, McClung scored 24 points and Yurtseven had another double-double (22 points and 11 rebounds), while Jamorko Pickett added 11 and Jagan Moseley 10. In the Xavier game, cold early shooting doomed the Hoyas: Georgetown started out shooting 3-for-16 (18.8 percent) from the field while Xavier built an early 23–8 lead, managed only 23 first-half points against the Musketeers, tying the season low in a half they had set against Providence on December 31, and scored fewer than 60 points for the first time all season. Georgetown's record against Xavier fell to 5–15 all time and to 3–11 in Big East play. Only Mac McClung scored in double figures against the Musketeers, finishing with 19 points.\nThe Hoyas finished January by hosting No. 16 Butler at Capital One Arena. Taking advantage of 12 first-half Bulldog turnovers and hitting 13 of 14 (92.9 percent) free throws, the Hoyas built a lead of as many as 13 points in the first half and went to the locker room at halftime with a 43–32 advantage. In the second half, however, Butler senior guard Kamar Baldwin led a Bulldog comeback, scoring 12 of his 13 points, and with 49.9 seconds left he fed the ball to redshirt senior guard Sean McDermott, who hit a three-pointer to give the Bulldogs the lead for good. Butler went on to win 69–64. Yurtseven had 14 points and 13 rebounds for yet another double-double, McClung finished with 12 points, Jagan Moseley added 11, and Qudus Wahab came off the bench to add 10 points and five rebounds, but the loss was Georgetown's sixth in eight games, and it dropped the Hoyas to 12–9 overall and 2–6 in the Big East.\nBefore the first game of February Georgetown's top scorer, Mac McClung, was reported to have suffered a foot injury during practice; after the season, his ailment was revealed as plantar fasciitis. At the time Georgetown announced McClung's injury, Ewing described McClung's availability as day-to-day, but McClung missed Georgetown's next game, a rematch with St. John's played at Madison Square Garden, and would make only one brief appearance in a game for the remainder of the season. In the St. John's game, the Hoyas broke their three-game losing streak and completed a regular-season sweep of the Red Storm, overcoming a 17-point deficit with 16 minutes to play to eke out a 73–72 victory. Jahvon Blair hit five three-pointers and finished with a career-high 23 points, Jagan Moseley scored 16, \nÖmer Yurtseven scored 13 and pulled down 15 rebounds for his twelfth double-double of the season overall and fifth against a Big East opponent, and Terrell Allen and Jamorko Pickett finished with 10 points each. Three days later in Washington, however, No. 12 Seton Hall opened the game with a 16–0 scoring run during which the Pirates made all four three-point shots they attempted, led 42–32 at halftime, and won for the ninth time in the last 11 meetings between the schools, Seton Hall senior guard Myles Powell scored 34 points on 12–for–24 shooting from the field, raising his per-game average against Georgetown to 29 points over five games. Yurtseven finished with his 13th double-double of the year (19 points and 15 rebounds), Jahvon Blair scored 18 points, and Terrell Allen added 11. Although the Hoyas hit 21 of 24 free throws, they shot only 38.3 percent from the field, and the Pirates blocked 11 of their shots.\nThe Hoyas next hosted DePaul and trailed by 11 points during the first half and six at halftime, but Jahvon Blair scored a career-high 30 points, Ömer Yurtseven contributed 16 and grabbed eight rebounds, Terrell Allen narrowly missed a double-double with 12 points and nine assists, Qudus Wahab came off the bench to block six shots, and Allen and walk-on George Muresan made clutch free throws in the final seconds and Georgetown came from behind for a win — but not before Yurtseven sprained his left ankle and left the game with 11 minutes to play. More shorthanded than ever with both McClung and Yurtseven unavailable and with its roster stretched to its limit, Georgetown visited No. 19 Butler a week later. Terrell Allen scored the first basket and seven of Georgetown's first 11 points as the Hoyas opened the game with an 11-2 scoring run. The Hoyas held their lead throughout the first half and were ahead 32–31 at halftime. The Bulldogs did not take a lead until early in the second half, and the two teams traded narrow leads as the half continued. With Georgetown clinging to a 61–60 lead with 3:46 left to play, Allen sank a jumper in the paint, then followed it with a three-pointer with 1:28 remaining to put the Hoyas ahead 66–60. Georgetown upset Butler 73–66, improving its all-time record at Hinkle Fieldhouse to 6–1. On 9-of-14 shooting from the field including 4-for-4 from three-point range, Allen tied his career high with 22 points; \"He played one of the best games that I've seen him play, one of the best games since he's been here,\" Ewing said. Jahvon Blair scored 16, Jamorko Picket finished with 12, and Qudus Wahab, starting for the injured Yurtseven, added 11. The defeat of Butler gave the Hoyas three wins in four games despite the loss of McClung and Yurtseven. With a record of 15–10 overall and 5–7 in the Big East, Georgetown retained hopes that its non-conference wins over three Power Five teams, the tough game it gave No. 1 Duke in November, and its quality wins in conference play could return the Hoyas to the NCAA Tournament in 2020 for the first time since 2015. But the win over Butler was the last of Georgetown's season.\nThe season-ending losing streak began when Providence came to Capital One Arena on February 19. Georgetown led at halftime, but the Friars shot 60 percent in the second half and came from behind to win by 10 points, sweeping the Hoyas in the season series. Mac McClung, still nursing his injured foot, made his first appearance since January 28 and his last of the season, playing only eight minutes, scoring two points and grabbing a rebound. Jahvon Blair led the Hoyas with 20 points, Terrell Allen had 16 points, and Jamorko Pickett had a double-double with 12 points and 12 rebounds. Three days later, DePaul broke an eight-game losing streak by beating Georgetown in Chicago. After recovering from his left-ankle sprain, Ömer Yurtseven started against DePaul but left the court with 9:10 remaining in the first half after injuring his right ankle; he returned to action with 5:43 left until halftime, but favored the ankle for the rest of the game, playing 25 minutes, scoring five points, and pulling down eight rebounds. Terrell Allen had 21 points and eight rebounds, Jamorko Pickett 19 points and seven rebounds, and Jagan Mosely 13 points against DePaul. Another loss followed at Marquette, as the Golden Eagles led by 11 points at halftime and won by 21 points, sweeping the Hoyas for the season. Yurtseven was unable to play due to his new ankle injury — he would remain out of action until the Big East tournament — and the Hoyas again proved unable to contain Marquette senior guard Markus Howard, who scored 30 points against them. Jagan Mosely had 19 points and six rebounds, Jahvon Blair 15 points, and Jamorko Pickett 12 points. With McClung and Yurtseven still out as March began and freshman center Malcolm Wilson arriving at the game with walking boot on his left foot after cracking a bone in his leg in practice the previous day, the losing streak stretched to four games when Georgetown hosted Xavier and fell behind 28–22 by halftime, scoring a season low in a half. The Hoyas came back to tie the game at 63–63 in the final seconds, but Xavier won the game 66–63 on a three-pointer with 4.5 seconds left, sweeping the season series. Jahvon Blair had 18 points, Jamorko Pickett added 12 points, and Jagan Mosely had 11 points and seven assists. Georgetown's record fell to 15–14 overall and 5–11 in the Big East.\nGeorgetown concluded its season with two more games against ranked opponents. In the first, the Hoyas visited No. 8 Creighton. The Bluejays, who hit a season-high 17 three-pointers in 36 attempts, led 48–33 at halftime. In the second half, they extended their lead to 60–39 before the Hoyas went on an 8–0 scoring run to close to 60–47. Creighton then had a 15–6 run of its own and went on to win the game 91–76. In a losing cause, Jahvon Blair led the Hoyas with 22 points, Jamorko Pickett had 17, Terrell Allen finished with 10, and Qudus Wahab, starting for Yurtseven, had the first double-double of his collegiate career with 14 points and 12 rebounds, both season highs for him. No. 14 Villanova then visited Washington on March 7 to close out the regular season. On Senior Day at Capital One Arena, Villanova opened the game with a 14–0 scoring run, and led by as many as 17 points during the first half on 60 percent shooting from the field and 8–for–13 from three-point range, taking a 39–30 lead into halftime. The Hoyas scored the first 11 points of the second half and took a 41–39 lead with 17:35 left to play. The Wildcats pulled back ahead and held their largest lead of the second half at 54–48 with 10:26 left in the game, but Georgetown battled back to a 69–65 lead with 1:04 remaining. Villanova closed to 69–67 with 47 seconds to play. With 5.6 seconds left, Jamorko Pickett fouled Villanova junior forward Jermaine Samuels as Samuels drove the basket and Qudus Wahab blocked Samuels's shot. After a video review, officials confirmed a goaltending call on Wahab, making the basket count, and Samuels then sank his free throw for a three-point play that gave the Wildcats a 70–69 lead. Terrell Allen's shot at the buzzer missed, and, amid a chorus of boos from Georgetown fans displeased with the late-game officiating, Villanova spoiled Georgetown's upset bid with a game-ending 5–0 scoring run. Georgetown's overall record for a season fell below .500 for the first time in Ewing's three-season tenure as head coach. Pickett finished with 20 points, Allen with 17, and Jagan Mosely, in his last home game, with 13 points.\nGeorgetown clearly missed McClung and Yurtseven, who were averaging a combined 30 points a game when they succumbed to injury, and concluded its regular season with a six-game losing streak and a record of 15–16 overall. For the third time in four seasons, the Hoyas finished with a 5–13 record in the Big East. Georgetown's hopes of consideration for an NCAA bid had vanished with the losing streak, and it entered the Big East tournament needing at least one win, and probably more, for 2020 National Invitation Tournament consideration.\nBig East tournament.\nGeorgetown was seeded eighth in the 2020 Big East tournament. In the first round, played on March 11, the Hoyas faced St. John's, which had finished the regular season tied with the Hoyas but was seeded ninth based on tie-breaking criteria, which gave the nod to Georgetown for sweeping the regular-season series between the teams. It was the third time in four years that the teams had met in the first round of the tournament, playing in the eight-vs.-nine game in each case. Recovering from a medical procedure on his injured foot, Mac McClung did not accompany the team to New York. Ömer Yurtseven did not start, but returned to action off the bench. During the first half, the Hoyas shot 54.5 percent from the field and Terrell Allen scored 18 points, reaching 1,000 points for his college career with his 15th point. In contrast, St. John's struggled to mount a consistent offense during the half and shot only 2–for–13 (15.4 percent) from three-point range. The Hoyas led 42–33 at halftime, and they quickly extended their lead to 15 points in the second half, jumping out to a 48–33 advantage with 18:31 remaining. Georgetown still led 62–52 with 6:31 left to play when the game's momentum shifted entirely to St. John's. During the remainder of the game, Georgetown did not score, missing all 10 shots it took and committing four turnovers. Meanwhile, St. John's finished the game with a 23–0 scoring run, during which Red Storm sophomore forward Marcellus Earlington scored 10 straight points. St. John's enjoyed its biggest comeback of the season by far and its largest in its 41 years of play in the Big East tournament, and the Red Storm knocked Georgetown out of the tournament with a 75–62 victory, the Red Storm's third straight defeat of the Hoyas in a Big East tournament game. Terrell Allen scored 21 points and Jamorko Pickett finished with a double-double (13 points and 10 rebounds), while Yurtseven scored eight points and grabbed six rebounds in 21 minutes of play. The loss brought Georgetown's season to an end and left the Hoyas winless in the Big East tournament since 2016. They finished the season with a record of 15–17, their third losing season in five years, first since the 2016–2017 season, and first under Ewing, whose Big East tournament record as head coach fell to 0–3.\nSt. John's advanced to play top-seeded Creighton in the first game of the quarterfinals on March 12 and was leading at halftime when the Big East announced the cancellation of the game and of the remainder of the Big East tournament in an effort to reduce large gatherings of people during the growing COVID-19 pandemic. It was the last college basketball game played during the 2019–2020 NCAA basketball season; later that day, the NCAA cancelled all postseason basketball tournaments in 2020, bringing the 2019–2020 season to a sudden end.\nWrap-up.\nPlagued by roster problems which began with December's scandals and transfers and were compounded in February and March by injuries to its two top scorers, the 2019–2020 Georgetown team had a tumultuous, frustrating, and disappointing season. Projected preseason to finish sixth — and perhaps higher — in the Big East, the Hoyas finished in a tie for eighth, and they failed to win a Big East tournament game for the fourth straight season. The NCAA's cancellation of the 2020 NCAA Tournament and 2020 NIT occurred before selections for those tournaments could take place, but Georgetown's sub-.500 finish ensured that it would not have returned to the NCAA Tournament and made even an NIT appearance very unlikely. Had the NCAA Tournament taken place, the Hoyas thus would have missed it for a fifth straight year anyway, their longest absence from the tournament since their 31-season NCAA tournament drought from 1944 through 1974. For the fifth straight season, the Hoyas never made the Top 25 in either the Associated Press Poll or the Coaches Poll – the first time that had happened in five consecutive seasons since the Hoyas' 23-year absence from the rankings between 1953 and 1977.\nThe team played with great heart in spite of its loss of players and had some notable successes during the year, especially the six-game winning streak that followed the departure of Akinjo and LeBlanc and the upset win on the road over No. 19 Butler with both McClung and Yurtseven sidelined by injury. However, the team played so shorthanded from December onward that fatigue took its toll as the season wore on, with the few remaining scholarship players getting little rest during games and having little energy left even for practices; Ewing resorted to having former players — such as recent graduates Kaleb Johnson, Greg Malinowski, and Trey Mourning — join the team for practices to fill out a practice squad, and in March Malinowski told \"The Washington Post\" that the practices had become less physically demanding than the ones he remembered while playing for Ewing during the 2018–2019 season in order to allow greater rest for the healthy scholarship players, of which only six remained at the end of the regular season. Georgetown's lack of depth meant that it could not trade fouls with its opponents, requiring the Hoyas to play less aggressively than they otherwise might have, and opponents took advantage of Georgetown's slim roster by rotating their players in and out frequently and establishing a rapid pace of play to tire out the Hoyas by the second half of games. Relying on inside scoring, the 2019–2020 squad had not shot well from three-point range, and had shown troubling defensive lapses.\nMac McClung started 20 of the 21 games he played in but, hobbled by injury throughout February and March, he missed all but eight minutes of the final 11 games of the season. He scored 330 points on 39.4 percent shooting from the field and 32.3 percent from three-point range and he finished the season as the team's top scorer on a per-game basis, averaging 15.7 points, and he grabbed 3.1 rebounds per game. Suffering an injured ankle in each of the two DePaul games, Ömer Yurtseven could not play in six of the season's final eight games, but he nonetheless scored 406 points, the most by any Hoya during the year, appearing in 26 games and starting all of them except for the Big East tournament game, shooting 54.9 percent from the field and averaging 15.5 points and 9.8 rebounds per game. The only other player to score more points than McClung was Jahvon Blair, who appeared in 31 games and started 12, scored 335 points on a field-goal percentage of 36.1 and a three-point percentage of 32.6, and averaged 10.8 points and 3.1 rebounds per game. Jamorko Pickett and Jagan Mosely, an ironman of the season with six complete 40-minute games played, both started every game of Georgetown's 32-game season, Pickett averaging 10.2 points and 6.3 rebounds per game and shooting 58.1 percent overall from the field and 38.4 in three-pointers and Mosely averaging a team-high 34.8 minutes per game, finishing with 8.2 points and 4.5 rebounds per game, and shooting percentages of 58.1 percent overall from the field and 38.4 percent in three-pointers. Terrell Allen also played in every game, starting 25 of them — all of his starts came after he took over as point guard from the departed James Akinjo — shooting 44.8 percent from the field and 40.4 percent in three-pointers, averaging 9.5 points and 2.4 rebounds per game. Qudus Wahab had a promising year, starting seven times for the injured Yurtseven and appearing in all 32 games, shooting 58.3 percent and averaging 5.5 points and 4.3 rebounds per game. Timothy Ighoefe also showed potential in limited action, coming off the bench to average 2.5 points over 12 games. James Akinjo started all seven games in which he played, shooting 33.7 percent from the field and 24.2 percent from three-point range, averaging 13.4 points and three rebounds per game. Josh LeBlanc played in six games, all off the bench, shooting 59.3 percent from the field and 50.0 percent in three-pointers and averaging 7.2 points and 1.8 rebounds per game. Galen Alexander appeared in nine games, all as a reserve, shooting 42.9 percent from the field and 43.8 percent from beyond the arc, scoring 4.2 points and pulling down 2.7 rebounds per game. Myron Gardner appeared in eight games, all off the bench, averaging 3.1 points per game on 36.4 percent shooting from the field and grabbing 2.9 rebounds per game. Among the walk-ons, George Muresan saw 85 minutes of action off the shorthanded bench — compared to 25 minutes combined over his previous three seasons — contributing 10 points and 11 rebounds over 19 appearances, while Jaden Robinson played 45 minutes over 11 games and finished with 10 points and five rebounds and Chuma Azinge appeared in five games, played 11 minutes, and scored a point. Malcolm Wilson did not appear in a game.\nJagan Mosely and George Muresan graduated in May 2020 and graduate transfer Terrell Allen also completed his college eligibility with the end of the season. In his 125-game career, Moseley started 60 games, shooting 46.4 percent overall from the field and 35.5 percent from three-point range and averaging 5.5 points and 2.8 rebounds per game, and he scored 692 points. Muresan, a four-year walk-on, finished with appearances in 31 games during his college career, playing 110 minutes, scoring 13 points, and grabbing 12 rebounds. In addition to his single season at Georgetown, Allen played for a year at Drexel and for two years at Central Florida, and he finished his four-season college career having played in 128 games, starting 108 of them, shooting 44.8 percent from the field and 40.4 percent from three-point range and averaging 7.9 points and 2.9 rebounds per game, scoring 1,006 points. The Class of 2020 was the second consecutive graduating class to spend its entire four years at Georgetown without ever playing in an NCAA Tournament game, the first back-to-back Georgetown graduating classes to miss the NCAA Tournament entirely during their college careers since the Classes of 1973 and 1974.\nNews of Josh LeBlanc's transfer to LSU broke on January 1, and on January 7 Arizona announced James Akinjo's transfer to play for the Wildcats. When he left the team on December 2, Akinjo had played in 40 games in his Georgetown career of one season plus four weeks, starting 39 of them, and averaged 13.4 points and 2.9 rebounds per game, shooting 35.9 percent from the field and 36.1 percent in three pointers. Leaving the same day, LeBlanc also played for Georgetown for one season plus four weeks, appearing in 39 games, making 22 starts, scoring 342 points on 62.5 percent shooting from the field and 63.6 percent from three-point range, averaging 8.8 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. On January 23, the press reported Galen Alexander's transfer to Texas Southern after a seven-week playing career with Georgetown. Myron Gardner quietly transferred to South Plains College, also after only seven weeks of action with the Hoyas.\nThe season ended with a widespread assumption that Ömer Yurtseven would not return to Georgetown for the 2020–2021 season, and on April 27 he declared for the 2020 National Basketball Association draft and hired an agent, bringing his college eligibility to an end after a single season of play as a Hoya. He went undrafted. Yursteven had played two seasons at North Carolina State before arriving at Georgetown, and over his three-season college career he played in 81 games, starting 61 of them, shooting 53.9 percent from the field and 42.6 percent from three-point range and averaging 12.1 points and 7.1 rebounds per game. On May 5, Jamorko Pickett announced he would also enter the 2020 NBA draft, although he retained his college eligibility for the time being. Ultimately, he returned to Georgetown for the following season.\nConfusion over Mac McClung's plans arose during the spring. On March 29, he surprised many observers by announcing his intention to enter the 2020 NBA draft while taking steps to maintain his college eligibility if he withdrew from the draft by June 15. After Ewing told the press on May 5 that he understood that McClung would return to Georgetown for the 2020–2021 season, McClung's agent disputed it, saying that McClung remained in the draft, and McClung's representatives later told the press that Ewing's comments may have influenced how NBA teams viewed McClung. Finally, on May 13, McClung announced that he had withdrawn from the NBA draft and would transfer from Georgetown in an effort to gain collegiate experience elsewhere as a point guard, which NBA teams had urged him to do, rather than in the shooting guard role he played with the Hoyas. McClung told ESPN, \"It was a number of different events that made me feel I had no choice but to transfer from Georgetown. I really wanted to stay, but things throughout my career made me realize that I couldn’t. I’m looking for a place I can call home, a place I can be a part of a family and help them succeed.\" On May 27, he announced that he would transfer to Texas Tech for the 2020–2021 season and apply for a waiver from the NCAA requirement to sit out a season after transferring. McClung finished his two seasons at Georgetown with appearances in 50 games, 49 of them starts, averaging 14.2 points and 2.8 rebounds per game, shooting 39.3 percent overall and 29.5 percent from three-point range. McClung's departure meant that Ewing had lost his entire 2018 class of recruits — Akinjo, Leblanc, Grayson Carter, and McClung — to transfer, and it capped off the Hoyas' tumultuous 2019–2020 season. McClung was the fifth Georgetown player to transfer since December and the eighth in Ewing's three years as head coach.\nGeorgetown's season began in November with great promise and high expectations. The Georgetown program and its fans had expected a breakout season in which the Hoyas performed well in Big East play, returned to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in five years, and put themselves in a position to build further for the 2020–2021 season. Even before McClung announced his exploration of NBA draft prospects in late March, however, at least some observers felt that by the time it ended on a seven-game losing streak, with a record little better than that of John Thompson III's final year as head coach in the 2016-2017 season and with a depleted roster, the 2019–2020 season instead represented a step backward for the program, with no real progress toward a return to the NCAA Tournament and national prominence during Ewing's three years as head coach. McClung's transfer heightened these concerns; the hope that in 2020–2021 Georgetown would reestablish itself as an elite team, nationally ranked and likely to resume annual NCAA Tournament appearances, had been replaced by an expectation of another rebuilding year in 2020–2021 in which real success in the Big East and an NCAA Tournament bid were unlikely. The loss of five players to transfer, the graduation of Jagan Mosely, and Yurtseven's departure for a professional career left Georgetown with only two players on its roster who would be seniors the following season and the likelihood of having seven or more new faces on that team. Its offseason needs included securing graduate transfers among its recruits to season what otherwise promised to be a young and inexperienced team in 2020–2021. With three open scholarship positions left to fill even before the loss of McClung opened up a fourth, and under great pressure to find both top talent and players whose character issues would not lead to a repeat of the scandals of December, Ewing and his staff had begun an aggressive recruiting effort by mid-March, reportedly exerting a greater effort to assess the character and \"coachability\" of players before recruiting them.\nThe disappointing 2019–2020 season left Georgetown's fan base split in its feelings about Ewing. Ewing had demonstrated talent as a head coach under difficult circumstances, but the transfers of 2019–2020, as well as three other transfers and two dismissals of players from the program during Ewing's three-year tenure as head coach, made it unclear that he could retain the talent he recruited and raised concerns that there might be systemic problems in the program. The program and its fans hoped that the loss of Mac McClung was the final step in moving on from Ewing's failure to retain any of the recruiting class of 2018. With the COVID-19 pandemic sweeping the world in the spring of 2020 — Ewing himself announced on May 22 that he had tested positive for COVID-19 and was undergoing treatment at a hospital in the Washington, D.C., area; his son, former Georgetown player and assistant coach Patrick Ewing Jr., announced on May 25 that he had left the hospital and was recovering at home — it was unclear whether a college basketball season would be played in 2020–2021, but if the season took place, the hope at Georgetown was that the team could use it to build toward a more successful future, perhaps with a return to the NCAA Tournament during the 2021-2022 season.\nAttendance.\nGeorgetown averaged 7,939 fans per home game during the 2019–2020 season, 66th among the 351 NCAA Division I teams and a 10 percent increase over the 30-year low of 7,212 they averaged per game the previous season. On average, a Georgetown game filled Capital One Arena to 38.6 percent of its capacity. In Big East Conference home games, the Hoyas averaged 8,854 fans per game, which was eighth out of the ten teams in the conference and on average filled Capital One Arena to 43.1 percent of its capacity.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| 2019 Bahamas Foreign Tour (Exhibition)\n!colspan=9 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big East regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"|Big East tournament"

        "title": "MicroProse Golf",
        "text": "MicroProse Golf is a golf video game developed by The Thought Train and published by MicroProse. It was released in 1991 for Amiga and Atari ST. In 1992, an enhanced MS-DOS version, featuring golf instructor David Leadbetter, was released in the United States as David Leadbetter's Greens and in the United Kingdom as David Leadbetter's Golf. The game's variety was praised, and some critics considered it the best golf game available.\nGameplay.\n\"MicroProse Golf\" includes six golf courses. It features 11 game modes, including medal play, skins, four-ball golf, and foursome. The game features typical golf obstacles, including trees, water, and sand. Onscreen icons show the strength and direction of the wind, which can also affect the player's golfing. Other icons represent various options available to the player. Among the options is the ability to position the golfer's feet. The player can also make the golfer left-handed or right-handed, and can choose the color of the golfer's jersey. The player can also adjust the height and position of the tee, and can choose between using yards or meters for distance measurements.\nThe game includes a driving range and a putting green where the player can practice, and various handicap options are available to the player. The player can also refer to an overhead map of the course that can be viewed from different angles. The golf swing meter is represented through two circular-shaped bars. The player can choose to view replays of golf shots from several different camera angles, and can also choose to save replays. When the player reaches the green, a grid appears on the ground to aid in putting. Different camera views can be used on the green.\nThe game includes a multiplayer option for up to four players. In the MS-DOS version, golf instructor David Leadbetter provides advice to the player throughout the game.\nDevelopment and release.\n\"MicroProse Golf\" was developed by The Thought Train and was published by MicroProse. The development team consisted of Lee Hodgson and Mark Davies, both keen golfers and the programmers of the game. Hodgson worked on the game's presentation and artificial intelligence, and Davies worked on the 3D graphics. Development commenced in May 1990, under the working title \"3D Golf\". It was the first game developed by The Thought Train. Project manager Tim Roberts said about Hodgson and Davies, \"They're fairly fresh out of college – they've done little bits here and there, but nothing substantial.\" Roberts said that the development team's goal was to strike a balance between simulation and gameplay. The team created their own designer program to create the courses. The course designer was described as \"an unwieldy creature,\" although Roberts said there was a possibility of refining it and releasing it to the public, allowing players to create their own custom courses. Such an idea was contingent on the initial game's success.\nThe game renders all the courses in 3D using vector calculations, except for the golfer. The camera tracks the ball from its flight in mid-air to its landing. It was believed that the player would generally be focused on the ball rather than the background, so the development team chose to reduce graphical details in the background during these scenes in order to maintain the frame rate. The full graphical details are restored once the ball has landed. A similar technique had already been used in MicroProse's 3D flight simulation games.\n\"MicroProse Golf\" was released in the United Kingdom in October or November 1991, for Amiga and Atari ST. It is claimed that the game was the first golf game to use the circular bar swing method, which would become common in later golf games. This quote seems to be referring to the circular/arced power meter centered on the player, as circular/arced power bars had been previously used in 1990's \"\" (DOS), in 1989 for golf games \"Next Open\" (TG-16), \"New 3D Golf Simulation: Harukanaru Augusta\" (PC-98), \"The Golf\" (MSX), and in 1986's \"Albatross\" (MSX).\nThe MS-DOS version is an enhanced port of the earlier versions that includes 256 colors and more-realistic landscapes. Other changes included the digitization of trees, sprites, and sound effects. Improvements were also made to the swing meter and putting. In mid-June 1992, at the U.S. Open, MicroProse announced a partnership with David Leadbetter for the upcoming version. On June 29, 1992, MicroProse announced it would be delayed to allow for Leadbetter to be implemented into the game. It was released later in 1992. In the United States, it was published under the title \"David Leadbetter's Greens: The Instructional 3-D Golf Simulation\". In the United Kingdom, it was released as \"David Leadbetter's Golf\".\nReception.\nSome critics considered it to be the best golf game available, or among the best. \"Games-X\" wrote that it surpassed \"World Class Leaderboard\" \"in every way.\" The magazine also stated that the Atari ST version had slightly smoother vector graphics compared to the Amiga version. Paul Presley of \"The One\" called it \"one of the most technically complete golfing sims available.\"\nThe graphics received some praise, although Gary Whitta of \"ACE\" considered them \"functional rather than decorative\" and wrote, \"Unpolished graphics and annoyingly jerky 3D don't do the eyes many favors, and neither does the tendency to fade out the background detail whenever the ball is in motion.\" Stuart Campbell of \"Amiga Power\" also criticized the fact that once the golf ball is hit, \"all but the close foreground is suddenly blanked out by a cloak of light blue,\" calling it a \"rather unsettling\" effect.\nPaul Rigby of \"Amiga Computing\" considered it the best-looking golf game on the Amiga. John Minson of \"The Guardian\" stated that the scenery \"gives a realistic sense of rolling landscapes,\" and concluded that it was \"undoubtedly a contender\" among computer golf games. Stephen Poole of \"Game Players\" stated that players accustomed to the \"Links\" series \"may initially turn up their nose at the graphically plain\" visuals in \"David Leadbetter's Greens\" before accepting it. Poole wrote that rather than focusing on its graphics, the game \"instead offers features you won't find in any other golf simulation,\" with the result being a \"highly playable\" and enjoyable golf simulation \"sure to develop its own following.\" The variety of game options was praised.\n\"MicroProse Golf\" received mixed comparisons to \"PGA Tour Golf\". Whitta considered the two games to be evenly as good, while other critics considered \"PGA Tour Golf\" superior. Frank O'Connor of \"Computer and Video Games\" wrote that \"MicroProse Golf\" \"isn't quite as slick or smooth as PGA, but it's got tons of options that PGA never had.\" Presley wrote that \"MicroProse Golf\" was superior to \"PGA Tour Golf\" in some aspects such as variety, but lacking in others. Rigby preferred \"MicroProse Golf\", calling it \"expertly designed\". \"Amiga Action\" called the game \"technically impressive,\" but preferred \"PGA Tour Golf\" for its simplicity. Campbell felt that \"PGA Tour Golf\" had superior presentation and gameplay.\nSome critics were disappointed with the sound effects. Dave Pyron of \"Computer Gaming World\" praised the game but had several minor criticisms, including the \"skimpy and inadequate sound\", which he considered to be \"the most serious blemish\". Trenton Webb of \"Amiga Format\" also considered the sound to be the weakest aspect of the game. Ed Ricketts of \"ST Format\" praised the sound.\nDavid Crook and Jeane Decoster of the \"Los Angeles Times\" considered \"David Leadbetter's Greens\" to be a knock-off of the \"Links\" series, writing that the game \"proves the cliche: Imitation is the sincerest form of capitalism.\" They stated that the game would likely appeal to people unfamiliar with the \"Links\" series. \"PC Zone\" considered \"David Leadbetter's Golf\" to be a better choice for casual gamers than \"Links 386 Pro\". \"Game Players\" stated that \"David Leadbetter's Greens\" \"lags behind\" \"Links 386 Pro\" and the \"Jack Nicklaus\" series, and that it has unrealistic graphics by comparison, but that it \"overcomes this by providing something unique – the first 3-D view in a golf game.\" The magazine concluded that it was a must-buy game for computer golfers.\nDuncan MacDonald of \"Zero\" called the game a must-buy, but mentioned that it had unrealistic environments: \"The terrain undulates like a giant irregular sine curve from Hell at times, with valleys here, hills there and rivers, lakes, bunkers, trees, bushes and cart-paths in between.\" O'Connor criticized the abundance of water on the courses, calling it one of the game's annoying aspects and writing, \"It seems like every couple of yards there's a lake or a river.\" Webb praised the game's balance of playability and accuracy. Ricketts was disappointed by the limited number of courses. Some critics considered the game's retail price too high.\nIn 1993, \"MicroProse Golf\" was ranked number 21 on \"ST Format\"'s list of 50 best Atari ST games. Later that year, \"Amiga Computing\" reviewed the game again and called it addictive, while praising its realism and 3D graphics. The magazine wrote that it would appeal to both golfers and non-golf fans, and stated that it was probably the easiest and most user-friendly golf game available. In 1994, Scott A. May of \"Compute!\" called \"David Leadbetter's Greens\" \"without a doubt the finest instructional golf simulation on the market.\""

        "text": "The 1901-02 Oregon Agricultural College men's basketball team was the first in the history of the school, known today as Oregon State University. The team sport was organized by W.O. \"Dad\" Trine, who was also the school's track coach.\nThe nickname of OAC teams in this era was the \"Aggies,\" with today's team name, the \"Beavers\" first adopted during the decade of the 1920s. The team was independent, scheduling games on an ad hoc basis rather than as part of a formal sports conference.\nTeam history.\nBackground.\nBasketball was invented in December 1891 by physical education teacher James Naismith and rapidly achieved popularity as an indoor sport for the winter season. The sport came to Oregon rapidly, being declared \"all the rage\" as a training sport for football participants in January 1893, with the Salem YMCA forced to add additional classes to meet surging demand.\nA women's basketball team was established at OAC during the academic year of 1897-98, with one game played in the spring of 1898 by the school squad in response to a challenge offered by the team of the Chemawa Indian Institute of Salem. The match, played April 29 in Salem at the Willamette University gym, was won by OAC by a score of 13 to 11. The OAC team included Inez Fuller, Fanny Getty, Dora Hodgin, Blanche Holden, Bessie Smith, and Leona \"Nonie\" Smith.\nThe OAC women's basketball team was more formally organized by the 1899-1900 academic year, with Bessie Smith elected team president as well selecting a full slate of officers, including a vice-president, secretary, and treasurer. Scheduling was handled by the team manager, Mr. J.H. Gallagher.\nA news item in the \"Corvallis Gazette\" of January 8, 1901 mentions the name of former OAC student Fred W. Smith as \"the father of basketball at that institution.\" It is unclear whether he was related to Bessie Smith of the OAC women's team. Smith (OAC Class of 1900) was tapped as the coach of the OAC women's team in October 1899.\nFormal organization.\nWhile the 1901-02 team was OAC's first school-sanctioned men's club, the sport was played competitively on campus with an admission fee charged during previous academic years. A game between students took place in the school's armory on January 26, 1901 following a baseball game between commissioned and non-commissioned military officers. Played before a substantial audience, the exhibition basketball game was won by a team calling itself the \"White Roses\" by a score of 4 to 0.\nCollegiate football had come to Corvallis, Oregon in the fall of 1893, when the Oregon Agricultural College Aggies fielded their first squad. It was not until 1901-02, when track coach W.O. \"Dad\" Trine formally established the school's first men's basketball squad.\nTrine would serve as the team's coach until he was replaced in 1908 by E.D. Angell.\nThe OAC basketball team was independent during the 1901-02 academic year, scheduling its games on an ad hoc basis rather than as part of a formal sports conference.\nPersonnel.\nThe 1901-02 OAC Aggies team included the following members:"

The objective is not to create combined medal tables; the focus is on listing the best positions achieved by cyclists in major international competitions, ranking the nations according to the most podiums accomplished by cyclists of these nations. All major World Championships organized by Union Cycliste Internationale (International Cycling Union, UCI) are covered, as well as cycling events at the Olympic Games.\nResults.\nFor the making of the list, results from major senior-level international UCI World Championships and the cycling events at the Summer Olympics were consulted. Junior and under-23 events at the UCI World Championships were not taken into account. Results obtained by amateur athletes, or in amateur events, were considered for the list.\nThe conventions used on this table are: \nEvents held at the UCI Motor-paced World Championships were counted as part of road events. Four-cross events were counted as part of the Mountain Bike and Trials World Championships (MTB&amp;T). Indoor results comprise all artistic events as well as cycle ball events.\nThe following World Championships were not considered for this list:\nThe table is pre-sorted by total number of first-place results, second-place results and third-place results, respectively. When equal ranks are given, nations are listed in alphabetical order. Defunct National Olympic Committees (NOCs) or historical teams are shown in \"italics\".\nAlso, it is important to note that official documents from UCI credit a medal at the 1984 UCI Track Cycling World Championships to Zhou Suying as a medal for North Korea, while in reality Syuing represented China. Cyclists from North Korea have never earned medals at the UCI World Championships, and this is reflected on this list."

        "text": "The 1978–79 Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey team represented the University of Minnesota in college ice hockey. In its 7th year under head coach Herb Brooks the team compiled a 32–11–1 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the eighth time. The Golden Gophers defeated North Dakota 4–3 in the championship game at the Olympia Stadium in Detroit, Michigan to win their third national championship.\nSeason.\nEarly lead.\nMinnesota began the 1978–79 season well, winning two games before each of their losses through mid-November. Steve Janaszak, one of the four remaining players from Minnesota's last national championship team, received the lion's share of minutes in goal as the Gophers built an early lead in both the WCHA and Big Ten. After the calendar had turned to December, Minnesota visited a resurgent North Dakota who had already climbed up to second place in the conference. The teams split the series and Minnesota headed home with an 11–4 record.\nThe Gophers played host to three ECAC Hockey teams during the winter break and though Harvard gave them a good game, Minnesota swept both weekend to build their record to 15–4. When the Gophers returned to conference play they throttled Michigan with Janaszak posting his only shutout of the season. That dominance likely led to a bit of soft play the following weekend when the Gopher's didn't show up against Minnesota–Duluth and the squad played its first weekend all season without recording a win.\nTrouble on the road.\nAfter the failed homestand Minnesota spent the following two weekends outside of Minnesota. The first series against Wisconsin began well but the Badgers salvaged a split in the second game. The Gophers then headed southwest to play Denver and lost both games to a middling Pioneer squad. With their conference record dented, Minnesota returned to the Williams Arena and hosted two weak teams over two weeks, easily winning four games, before ending up in Notre Dame where they lost two close affairs. The pair of losses were at an inopportune time because it allowed North Dakota to build a 5-point lead in the WCHA race.\nWhile the two teams would play to end the season Minnesota needed help from a bad Michigan State team who were fighting just to make the conference tournament. Before they could worry about that, however, they had to take care of business at home against Michigan Tech. The Gophers won both of their games and watched as the Fighting Sioux lost on Saturday to give Minnesota a chance at the conference title. The next weekend Minnesota opened with a 5–2 win over North Dakota but could not keep the momentum going and failed to win the crown after losing the second game.\nWCHA tournament.\nWith their second-place finish Minnesota was guaranteed home ice for the conference playoffs. After breezing through the first round against Michigan Tech, Minnesota hosted Minnesota–Duluth, one of only two team to have a winning record against the Golden Gophers in the regular season. Minnesota fought valiantly in the first game with Janaszak turning aside all but one shot from a potent Bulldog attack. Minnesota pulled away in the second game, scoring six times, and captured their sixth WCHA tournament title.\nNCAA tournament.\nWhile the Gophers earned one of the two WCHA bids, the other went to North Dakota and because the Fighting Sioux had finished the regular season with a better conference record, Minnesota was slotted into the second western seed. Because of this Minnesota was forced to begin the tournament against CCHA champion Bowling Green who had proven the year before that they could compete on a national\nstage. Minnesota proved the stronger team, however, winning the first round match 6–3 and punching their ticket to Detroit.\nIn the semifinals Minnesota met New Hampshire, the top offence team in the east, and the two battled a close contest for 60 minutes with the Gophers ending up as the victors. In the championship game Minnesota faced UND for the seventh time that season. The Fighting Sioux elected to start senior Bill Stankoven over freshman Bob Iwabuchi despite the underclassmen's superior numbers. That choice did not pan out as the Gophers scored three times in the first period and took a 2-goal lead into the second. Iwabuchi found himself in goal from the remainder of the contest but the Fighting Sioux had a tough hill to climb. Janaszak played strong throughout the game but couldn't stop North Dakota from cutting into the lead with a late second period goal. Neal Broten restored the two goal advantage less than three minutes into the third but UND narrowed the gap back to 1 with just over ten minutes to play. The two teams fought desperately in the final half-period but neither side was able to score and Minnesota earned their third national title in only 6 years.\nAwards and honors.\nFor his superlative play in the three games, Steve Janaszak was named Tournament MOP and was on the All-Tournament Team with teammates Mike Ramsey, Steve Christoff and Eric Strobel. Defenseman Bill Baker was the team's sole representative on the AHCA All-American West Team and the All-WCHA First Team while team scoring leader Steve Christoff made the WCHA Second Team.\nThe 1978–79 Minnesota team joined the 1948–49 Boston College Eagles as the only teams to win a championship with all of their players having been born in one state or province and was the second time Minnesota had won a championship with only American players. Two Gophers were taken in the 1979 NHL Entry Draft with both (Mike Ramsey and Neal Broten) becoming All-Stars.\nHead Coach Herb Brooks would leave Minnesota that summer when he signed on to serve as the bench boss for the US National Team at the 1980 Winter Olympics. Unsurprisingly, Brooks drew heavily from the program he ran for seven season with 8 of 20 players coming from the 1979 championship team: Bill Baker, Neal Broten, Steve Christoff, Steve Janaszak, Rob McClanahan, Mike Ramsey, Eric Strobel and Phil Verchota.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | "

        "text": "The 2019–20 Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball team represented the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the 2019–20 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Badgers were led by fifth-year head coach Greg Gard and played their home games at the Kohl Center in Madison, Wisconsin as members of the Big Ten Conference.\nWith a win over Indiana on March 7, 2020, the Badgers earned a share of the Big Ten regular season championship. They finished the season 21–10, 14–6 in Big Ten play to finish in a three-way tie for first place. Their season ended following the cancellation of postseason tournaments due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nPrevious season.\nThe Badgers finished the 2018–19 season 23–11, 14–6 in Big Ten play to finish in fourth place. In the Big Ten tournament, the Badgers defeated Nebraska in the quarterfinals before losing to Michigan State in the semifinals. They received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as the No. 5 seed in the South Region, their 24th trip to the NCAA Tournament. They were upset in the First Round by No. 12-seeded Oregon.\nOffseason.\nMoore family car accident.\nIn the early morning hours of May 25, 2019, assistant coach Howard Moore and his family were involved in a car accident near Ann Arbor, Michigan that claimed the lives of his wife Jennifer and daughter Jaidyn. Moore was hospitalized for several weeks with severe burns while his son Jerell escaped with minor injuries. After a setback in his home and subsequent stint in the ICU, 46-year-old Moore was moved to a long-term care and rehab facility in July.\nOn July 31, 2019, Wisconsin named all-time leading scorer Alando Tucker an interim assistant coach to fulfill Moore's coaching duties for the 2019–20 season. Tucker had been serving as the athletic department's director of student-athlete engagement. \"Do Moore. Be Moore. 4 Moore\" became the 2019-20 team's motto.\nSeason Notes.\nMicah Potter's eligibility.\nA month before the season opener, the NCAA denied Wisconsin's waiver request to allow Micah Potter to compete during the fall semester, arguing he had not sat out a full year after enrolling at Wisconsin. Potter did not play during the 2018–19 season, but stayed in classes at Ohio State before transferring to Wisconsin for the spring 2019 semester.\n\"I don't understand why I am being punished additionally for doing what is encouraged of a student-athlete,\" Potter said in a statement released by UW. \"The penalty of a third semester to what I have already sat out seems unjust.\"\nWisconsin continued to appeal Potter's case throughout November. After the final denial, Gard called the situation \"unprecedented\" and expressed frustration with the NCAA's inconsistency on transfer rulings. \"I was hoping common sense would prevail in this,\" Gard said. \"Unfortunately, it didn’t.\"\nPotter made his Badger debut on December 21, 2019 against Wisconsin-Milwaukee after missing the first 10 games of the season.\nCircumstances surrounding Kobe King transfer.\nOn January 25, 2020, the day after a humbling loss to Purdue in which he was held scoreless, sophomore Kobe King informed coaches and teammates via text message that he intended to leave the team. At the time, King was Wisconsin's leading scorer (12.6 ppg) and second in minutes (28.9 mpg) in Big Ten games. King did not travel with the Badgers to Iowa City for the team's next game and publicly announced his decision to transfer two days later, citing unhappiness with the program. King originally committed to Bo Ryan and Wisconsin on September 16, 2015 and reaffirmed his commitment after Gard was hired.\nIn the aftermath of King's announcement, strength and conditioning coach Erik Helland self-reported an incident in which he repeated a \"repugnant word\" in front of several players while telling a story from his days on the Chicago Bulls training staff. King admitted mentioning the incident with UW officials during a January 31 meeting. Helland resigned on January 6, 2020 after an investigation by the university.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=|Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big Ten tournament\n!colspan=9 style=|\"Canceled\"\n!colspan=9 style=|NCAA tournament\n!colspan=9 style=|\"Canceled\""

All knockout matches had a reserve day.\nQualification.\nThe host India was the first team to qualify for the semi-finals after their mammoth 302-run win against Sri Lanka, their seventh successive win in the World Cup.\nSouth Africa became the second team to qualify for the semi-finals after Pakistan defeated New Zealand on 4 November; however, with that win, Pakistan kept their hope of the knockout stage alive.\nIndia secured the top place amongst the semi-finalists after they beat South Africa by 243 runs on 5 November at Eden Gardens in Kolkata, accumulating 16 points in 8 matches, as no other team would be able to gather as many points as India in their remaining matches.\nAustralia became the third team to qualify for the semi-finals after defeating Afghanistan on 7 November, sharing equal points with South Africa, and the two sides played against each other in the semi-finals.\nOn 11 November at Eden Gardens, England batted first, and scored 337/9 in 50 overs. For Pakistan to qualify for the semi-finals, they had to chase the total in 6.4 overs to surpass New Zealand in net run rate, as the teams had the same number of points. However, after the end of the first innings, New Zealand qualified for the semi-finals as the target was technically never possible to be chased down in 6.4 overs. Hence, New Zealand confirmed their berth in the semi-finals as the fourth team and faced India in the semi-final as they had done in the previous World Cup in 2019.\nThe match officials for the semi-finals were announced on 13 November 2023."

        "title": "2023 Cricket World Cup group stage",
        "text": "The 2023 Cricket World Cup group stage was played in a round-robin league format, with all ten teams playing each other once in a single group, resulting in a total of 45 matches being played. The top four teams from the group progressed to the knockout stage. This format was the same as the preceding 2019 Cricket World Cup and was also used in the 1992 Cricket World Cup.\nIndia won the group stage, defeating all other teams, as well as winning the semi-finals. New Zealand, South Africa and Australia also qualified for the knockout stages as a result of finishing in the top four. In the final, Australia beat India by six wickets to win their sixth World Cup.\nMatches.\nEngland vs New Zealand.\nThe two teams had met each other ten times in World Cups, most recently in the final of the 2019 edition which ended in a tie. England would go on win the tie-breaker, and the World Cup. In their earlier nine meetings, England had won four and lost five. In the rematch, New Zealand won the toss and sent England to bat first. England started off slow before captain Jos Buttler's arrival in the 22nd over improved their run rate. He hit two fours and sixes each, before being dismissed for 43. Joe Root's 77 and a tenth wicket partnership of 30 runs took England's total to 282. New Zealand's reply began with opening batter Will Young's dismissal for a first-ball duck. However, Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra, who was promoted to take an injured Kane Williamson's spot, put on an unbeaten 273-run stand for the second wicket. The duo started strongly and hit 13 fours and two sixes in the first Powerplay. In their debut World Cup appearances, they went on to make 152 and 123 runs respectively, and saw their team home with 13.4 overs to spare.\nNetherlands vs Pakistan.\nThis was the seventh match between the teams and third in World Cups, and the Netherlands were yet to secure a victory against Pakistan. The Netherlands won the toss and chose to field. Pakistan were reduced to 38/3 before Saud Shakeel and Mohammad Rizwan put on 120 runs for the fourth wicket, with both making half-centuries, the former's coming in 32 balls. Mohammad Nawaz and Shadab Khan then added 64 runs together, taking their team's total to a respectable 286. Bas de Leede stood out as the top bowler for the Netherlands, claiming four wickets. The Netherlands innings got off to a shaky start, losing Max O'Dowd early on, but Vikramjit Singh and Colin Ackermann provided some stability. However, the latter could not stick around for long and was dismissed to a loose shot off Iftikhar Ahmed. de Leede and Singh formed a vital partnership of 70 runs, with both players reaching half-centuries. Singh's departure triggered a collapse from 120 for 3 to 158 for 6. The lower order offered some resistance, with Logan van Beek hitting a few lusty blows in the end but the team fell short by 81 runs.\nAfghanistan vs Bangladesh.\nHaving defeated Afghanistan in both their previous World Cup meetings, Bangladesh put them to bat after winning the toss. Afghanistan began strongly and were at 83/1 after 15 overs. Shakib Al Hasan, appearing in his fifth World Cup, claimed three wickets as did Mehidy Hasan. Hashmatullah Shahidi (18) and Rahmanullah Gurbaz's dismissals when Afghanistan were at 112/2, led to a collapse of their middle and lower order, before the team was all out 44 runs after. With the ball, Afghanistan reduced Bangladesh to 27/2 and missed two catching opportunities of Mehidy Hasan, who made the best of it by putting on 97 runs with Nazmul Hossain Shanto for the third wicket. The partnership helped Bangladesh hand their opponents their thirteenth straight loss in World Cups.\nSouth Africa vs Sri Lanka.\nSri Lanka entered the match on the back of a solitary win against South Africa in their six World Cup meetings. Upon losing captain Temba Bavuma's wicket early on after being sent in to bat, Quinton de Kock and Rassie van der Dussen steadied South Africa's innings taking them to 118/1 after 20 overs. Both would go on to make centuries, 100 and 108 respectively, followed by the fastest ever in World Cups by Aiden Markram. Markram's innings included 14 fours and three sixes, and he particularly attacked Sri Lanka's paceman Matheesha Pathirana, who gave away 95 runs off his ten overs. Multiple records were broken in South Africa's innings, including the first instance of three batters making centuries in a World Cup match. Sri Lanka's chase of 428 began with one-drop Kusal Mendis reaching a half-century before any of his teammates had scored a single run. His innings of 76 came off 42 balls and included eight sixes. Fifties from Charith Asalanka (79) and captain Dasun Shanaka (68) briefly kept their team's chase alive, but the team fell short by 102 runs despite some late hitting by Kasun Rajitha.\nAustralia vs India.\nAustralia came into the match with a 8–4 record against India in World Cups. They started off strong with the bat and were 74/1 before a fluent David Warner (41) was dismissed caught and bowled by Kuldeep Yadav. Fellow spinner Ravindra Jadeja then claimed three wickets in a space of eleven deliveries reducing Australia to 119/5. Top-scorer Steve Smith's outside edge was beaten by a Jadeja delivery turning enough to hit his off stump. Captain Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc's late hitting took their team to 199. Controlled bowling effort by India meant a total of 171 dot balls were bowled. India's start with the bat was historically poor — three of their top four were dismissed without scoring — a first for them. While Starc took Ishan Kishan's wicket, fellow paceman Josh Hazlewood claimed Rohit Sharma and Shreyas Iyer, reducing India to two for three. Virat Kohli (85) made the best of his dropped catch in the eighth over by Mitchell Marsh and added 165 runs for the fourth wicket with KL Rahul, the highest fourth wicket partnership for India in World Cups. Both consistently rotated strike and scored only 14 fours and two sixes between them, helping their team reach the target with 8.4 overs remaining.\nNetherlands vs New Zealand.\nThe two teams had met only once in World Cups before, with New Zealand winning the game, in 1996. The Netherlands bowlers started off with three maiden overs, before New Zealand's Devon Conway and Will Young put on 67 runs together. Young then added 77 runs with Rachin Ravindra (51) for the third wicket. Daryl Mitchell's 48, Tom Latham's 53 off 46 and Mitchell Santner's 36 off 17 meant New Zealand posted a target of 323. Left-armer Santner made the best of the spin-friendly wicket and claimed the first five-wicket haul by a New Zealand spinner in World Cups, using his variation in pace. Colin Ackermann offered resistance with his strokeplay and put together 50 runs with Teja Nidamanuru, before the latter was run out. Santner, who chipped with wickets at regular intervals in the middle overs, removed captain Scott Edwards caught and bowled. Matt Henry's bounce and pace yielded him three wickets, including a bowled attempt of Vikramjit Singh. The Netherlands fell 99 runs short after he cleaned their tail up picking the final two wickets.\nPakistan vs Sri Lanka.\nSri Lanka got off to a strong start with the bat and were 229/3 after 30 overs. Kusal Mendis's century off 65 balls, which he reached with a six, was the fastest by a Sri Lanka player in World Cups. He particularly punished Shaheen Afridi and Haris Rauf, finished his innings striking at 158.44. His partners were Pathum Nissanka (51) and Sadeera Samarawickrama, who made 108 off 89 deliveries, helping his team go past 300. Pakistan looked in trouble at 37/2 having lost captain Babar Azam in the eighth over. However, Abdullah Shafique and Mohammad Rizwan brought them back into the game, courtesy their 176-run stand for the third wicket. Shafique, who came in as a replacement to Fakhar Zaman, made 113, the most by a Pakistan debutant in World Cups. Rizwan battled through cramps and remained unbeaten at 131, helping his team attain the highest successful chase in World Cup history, Pakistan's previous record being 263. With the run rate climbing through the middle overs, the Pakistan batters accelerated their chase making 163 off the last 20 overs, thus extending their lead to 8–0 against their opponents in World Cups.\nAfghanistan vs India.\nIndia had won their only previous encounter against Afghanistan in World Cups. Afghanistan's openers fell cheaply and one-drop Rahmat Shah's dismissal left his team at 63 for 3. The team's only notable partnership came for the fourth wicket when captain Hashmatullah Shahidi and Azmatullah Omarzai put on 121 runs, before the latter was bowled out by a Hardik Pandya slower ball for 62. Kuldeep Yadav slowed the run rate for his opponents, and went on to removed Shahidi, who had stuck to the crease despite his partners falling at the other end. Pacer Jasprit Bumrah then restricted Afghanistan to adding only 83 in the final 15 overs. India's reply began with captain Rohit Sharma scoring in blistering fashion. He reached in century off 63 balls, overtaking Kapil Dev's 1983 effort for the fastest century by an India player in World Cup history. His effortless hitting involved to a 100-run stand with Ishan Kishan, with the latter only contributing 14 runs in the partnership. Kishan's dismissal for 47 and later Sharma's meant Virat Kohli (55) and Shreyas Iyer (25) took their team home with 15 overs to spare.\nAustralia vs South Africa.\nAustralia held the head-to-head edge over South Africa in World Cups by a 3–2 margin, with one match ending in a tie. South Africa got off to a quiet start with the bat through openers Quinton de Kock and captain Temba Bavuma. de Kock then took charge through a six and a couple of fours across the fifth and sixth overs, and the two put on a 108-run stand, before Rassie van der Dussen added 50 runs with de Kock for the second wicket. de Kock would go on make his second century on the trot, an innings that included eight fours and five sixes, before Aiden Markram (56) and Heinrich Klaasen (29) combined to add another fifty-run stand for their team. Australia pulled their opponents back when they were 263/3 after 43 overs, with their pacemen picking a few wickets towards the end of the innings. The innings was marked by poor fielding by Australia, who dropped five catches. Australia's top-order fell cheaply with only Marnus Labuschagne (46 off 74), batting alongside Mitchell Starc (29), offering some resistance to South Africa's bowling. Lungi Ngidi (1/18) and Marco Jansen (2/54) were impressive with the new ball, and helped reduce Australia to 70/6 as early as the 18th over. Steve Smith and Marcus Stoinis were both given out by the third umpire following referrals, both off Kagiso Rabada, who also bowled out Josh Inglis. Australia's only other notable stand came between Pat Cummins and Adam Zampa who made 32 runs between them. Dismissed for 177, they suffered their 15th loss in the last 18 matches against South Africa, the last four of them by more than 100-run margins."

But they had prevailed first in the group stage with four wins against France and Poland. In the quarter-final against Italy they reached in the home game only a 1-1. However, due to the 0–0 draw in the second leg, Italy were qualified for the European Championship finals by the away goals rule. As the other teams eliminated in the quarter-finals did not win and everyone lost at least one, Sweden was the fifth European team to qualify for the World Cup.\nIn the People's Republic of China, Sweden also qualified alongside Brazil, United States and Japan. On November 17, 1991, Sweden played in Panyu District their first World Cup match and lost to the US with 2: 3. It Lena Videkull scored the first World Cup goal for the Swedes with the 1: 3.\nIn the second game then followed a 8–0 against Japan, with Videkull after 30 seconds, the 1-0 and thus the fastest goal in a women's World Cup succeeded. With a 2–0 win over Brazil in their last group game, Sweden became second in the group and scored in the quarter-finals on the team of hosts and China. Already in the 3rd minute Pia Sundhage managed the 1: 0, where it remained until the end. In the semifinals then Norway was the opponent.

Nevertheless, they participated in the Qualification as it also served as a qualification for the Euro 1995. With four wins against the Slovakia and Latvia, they made it into the quarter-finals. Denmark was defeated 3–0 in the home game after a 2–0 away defeat. So they would have been athletically qualified for the World Cup. In the semi-final, they lost the away game against Norway with 3: 4, but won the home game with 4: 1. In the final in Germany against the defending champion they lost with 2: 3.\nAt the World Cup in their own country, Tomas Brolin and Kristin Bengtsson (Player of the Year and Player of the Year 1994 in Sweden) earned them four years previously Brazil and Japan zugelost, also EM Final opponents Germany. After a 1–0 defeat against Brazil, they were able to retaliate with 3: 2 against Germany for the European Championship final defeat. With a 2: 0 against Japan, they were tied with Germany group second, as they had the worse goal difference. In the quarter-final against China, they fell in the 29th Minute 0–1 in arrears and it remained until the 90th Minute. In the third minute of added time, Ulrika Kalte still managed to equalize. Since no team could score a goal in the subsequent extra time, there was the first penalty shootout at a women's World Cup. Here, the Chinese had the slightly better goal scorers and came through a 4: 3 in the semifinals. China then lost in the semi-final against Germany and also the small final against the USA. The Swedes, who were awarded the Fair Play Prize, had to watch their neighbor Norway win the final against Germany and become the first European team to win Women's World Cup. However, after qualifying for the quarter-finals, Sweden qualified for the women's first football tournament at the Olympic Games, in which only the eight best teams from the World Cup could participate. Weil, however England was the seventh best team in the Olympic Games not eligible to start, Brazil could participate as the ninth best team also.\n1999 World Cup.\nFor the third World Cup, UEFA then set up separate qualifiers for the first time and to date the only continental association. In the Qualification Sweden met the Ukraine, Iceland and Spain. With six wins in six games Sweden took first place with nine points ahead of Ukraine and qualified directly for the World Cup. Ukraine then lost in the play-offs of the runners-up against Germany, which thus also qualified.\nIn the US, the Swedes lost the opening match against China with 1: 2, with a 3–1 draw against Australia and a 2: 0 against World Cup newcomer Ghana but was still ranked second. In the quarterfinals they met the neighbors and defending champion Norway. After a scoreless first half, they lost 1: 3, which the World Cup was back in the quarterfinals.

Due to the SARS epidemic, the tournament was temporarily relocated to the United States. Thus the World Cup took place for the second time in the US. In the Qualification, Sweden met Denmark, Switzerland and neighbors Finland. With five wins and one defeat Sweden qualified as group winners for the World Cup. The second placed and tied Danes did not manage to qualify for the World Cup in the playoffs of the runners-up.

In this they also won against Canada 2-1 and reached the final for the first time. Here Germany was the opponent who had turned off the host and defending champion in the semifinals. After the first 40 minutes were scoreless Hanna Ljungberg scored in the 42nd minute 1-0 for the Swedes, which it went to the break. Immediately after a push back to the second half, Maren Meinert equalized. It remained until the end of regular time, so that there was an extension as four years earlier. In this Nia Kuenzer the only Golden goal in a women's World Cup game with which the German women for the first time world champion and Germany became the first world champion in men and women. For Sweden, second place is still the best finish to date and Sweden was also qualified for the Women's Football Tournament at the Olympic Games 2004, which hosted Greece only the two best European teams of the World Cup could participate.\n2007 World Cup.\nAt the finals, they met USA, Nigeria and North Korea. In the opening match against Nigeria, it was enough only to a 1-1. In the second game against the US, they lost 0–2. So they had to win in the last game against North Korea with three goals difference to reach the quarter-finals. But it only succeeded in a 2–1 victory with Sweden first time in the preliminary round eliminated. In the preliminaries, Sweden also failed to qualify for the women's football tournament at the 2008 Olympic Games, which was only attended by the three best European teams from the World Cup. As England was not allowed to start as the third best European team, Sweden and Denmark were allowed to play for this place. Sweden prevailed with 4: 2 and 3: 1 and then could participate.\nGroup B.\nThe four teams were also paired in the same group in 2003.\n2011 World Cup.\nFor the World Cup in Germany 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification, the Swedes with seven wins and a draw against the Czech Republic, Belgium, Wales and Azerbaijan. The Swedes scored with 17: 0 against Azerbaijan their highest international victory. With the 1–0 victory in the Czech Republic on the penultimate round Sweden secured the ticket for the play-off round of the group winners, this time was necessary. The first leg against Denmark was won 2: 1, as it was 1: 2 in the second leg after 90 minutes. In this secured Charlotte Rohlin, who had already scored the 1: 2-goal, with the goal to 2: 2 the World Cup ticket.\nIn Germany Sweden was dissolved into a group with the US and North Korea, as it had been four years earlier. A new addition was Colombia, which had qualified for the World Cup for the first time and Sweden beat the opening 1–0 win. After another 1: 0 against North Korea, the Swedes and the Americans were already qualified for the quarter-finals. In the direct comparison, it was only about who was group winner and thus vice-world champion Brazil went out of the way. The Swedes were able to win a World Cup match against the US for the first time with a score of 2: 1 in the quarter-finals Australia, which surprisingly eliminated Norway. With 3: 1, the Swedes prevailed against the Asian champions and reached the semi-finals. Here they met the surprise team Japan, which had eliminated hosts and two-times defending champions Germany in the quarterfinals. Sweden took the lead in the 10th minute through Josefine Öqvist, but had to accept the equalizer eight minutes later. It remained until the half-time break. In the second half, the Japanese could then shoot two more goals, while the attack efforts of the Swedes were unsuccessful. Japan was thus the first time in the final and was by a victory against the US in the penalty shootout as the first Asian team football world champion. Sweden won the small final against France the day before with a remarkable goal by Marie Hammarström even though she lost 22 minutes to Öqvist after Red Card. With the semi-final draw Sweden could also qualify for the Women's Football Tournament at the Olympic Games, in which only the two best European teams of the World Cup and United Kingdom could participate as hosts.\n2015 World Cup.\nIn the Qualification the Swedes prevail again. In the group were Scotland, Poland, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Northern Ireland and for the first time the Faroe Islands the opponents. After nine wins, Sweden and Scotland had at least reached the playoff games of the best runners-up. On the last day of the match, the Swedes won 2–0 against the Scottish side and were thus the last of the seven group winners to qualify directly for the World Cup finals. The Scots failed in the playoffs to the Netherlands, who qualified for the World Cup for the first time.\nIn the draw for the groups, the Swedes were not placed and were \"tied\" to Group D with USA, against whom they had to play four times in the preliminary round. Further group opponents are Australia and Nigeria. The group was considered the most balanced of the World Cup; it was the only one with four teams that at least reached the semi-finals in their last continental championship fights.\nSweden took the lead in their first game against Nigeria with two goals, twice exploiting the inexperience of Africans in corners. Nigeria could still turn the game and in the end, the Swedes had to be satisfied with the 3: 3. After a 0–0 draw against the US in the fifth meeting at a World Cup and a 1–1 draw against Australia, the Swedes reached as fourth-best group third in the second round. Here they lost with 1: 4 against Germany and retired. This meant that Sweden, the only European team to have participated in all past Olympic women's football tournaments, had also missed the direct qualification for the women's football tournament at the Olympic Games, but still had the chance to win the third European Olympic ticket in playoffs against the three other European knockout round losers. This was achieved in March 2016 when they were group first in the same playoff.\n2019 World Cup.\nAfter the quarter-finals at European Championship 2017 Pia Sundhage had given up the post of national coach, followed by Peter Gerhardsson. In addition, record goalscorer Lotta Schelin could no longer be used due to a neck injury sustained in June 2017, ultimately prompting her to end her career in August 2018.\nQualifying opponents became Denmark, the Ukraine, Hungary and Croatia. The Swedes started with a 2–0 victory in Croatia and then had to play for the first home game against Denmark, as the Danish association canceled the game because the Danish players did not want to compete because of disagreements with the association. UEFA finally scored the game 3-0 for Sweden.\nThe next three games won the Swedes with just one goal, but then lost in Ukraine with 0: 1, and thus for the first time against an Eastern European team. Although they then won the second leg against the Ukrainians, but by the defeat in the first leg, it was the last game in Denmark: with a draw or a victory, Sweden would qualify directly for the World Cup finals, in a defeat, the Danes would first time Since 2007, the finals have been reached again and Sweden should be in the playoffs of the best runners-up for the last European starting place. A goal from Sofia Jakobsson immediately after the half-time break gave Sweden a 1–0 win and qualified for the finals in France.\nIn France, for the first time Chile and Thailand and for the sixth time in the preliminary round, the USA were the group opponents. The Swedes started with a 2–0 victory against Chile, but had to wait until the 83rd minute for the first goal. The first goal came quicker in the 5–1 victory against Thailand, which was already achieved in the 6th minute. Even faster, they came into the backlog against the US in the third minute. The last goal of the 0–2 defeat then fell through a Jonna Andersson deflected shot. As second in the group, the Swedes met Canada and reached the quarter-final against Germany by a 1–0 victory. After 24 years without a competitive victory against Germany succeeded with a 2–1 to 0–1 deficit to the semi-finals against European champions Netherlands. In the semifinals the Swedes lost 1-0 after extra time. Sweden got a bronze medal after defeating England 2–1."

While Qatar has been a regular participant in the continental AFC Asian Cup, the national side has always fallen short in the final stage of World Cup campaigns. By hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup and its failure to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup held in Russia, Qatar became the only nation to play in World Cup without qualifying for it and the second nation after Italy (back in 1934) to qualifying for the World Cup as hosts after being absent in all previous World Cup before.\nIn 2017, the Qatari government has introduced reforms aimed at improving conditions for migrant workers. In January 2022, FIFA president Gianni Infantino acknowledged the country's amendments in work legislation, protection of workers and minimum wage while addressing more alterations to be made. FIFA President Gianni Infantino has defended Qatar's decision to host the tournament. Others have asserted that Qatar has a better human rights record than Russia and China, which were subjected to less harsh criticism for the same problems when hosting important athletic events in the years before the tournament.\nAccording to Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, prior to the tournament, \"the new Kafala system tranche of law will put an end to Kafala and establish a contemporary industrial relations system.\"\nQatar's national team showed some improvement in their performance since the country was awarded the tournament, including winning the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, and in 2019 Copa América drew against former champions and World Cup quarter-finalists Paraguay with 2-2.\nAt rank 50, Qatar entered the tournament as the third lowest ranked team of the total 32; placing higher only above Saudi Arabia and Ghana. The nation performed poorly and set some upsetting records among host nations in the process. Qatar became the first host nation to lose not only its opening match, but also all three of its matches. Upon losing the second match against Senegal with a score of 3-1, Qatar became the first host nation to be eliminated from the tournament in two matches after the Netherlands later on drew with Ecuador (putting both with four points, Senegal with three and Qatar with zero). Qatar also finished last in their group by failing to secure any point, making them the first host nation to have 0 points at the end of the group stage. The nation thereby became the worst performing host nation in the history of the tournament, overtaking South Africa, who had finished third in their group with 4 points and were eliminated based on goal difference."

They play their home games at Islanders Iceworks in Syosset, New York and Northwell Health Ice Center in East Meadow, New York.\nHistory.\nLong Island University announced the addition of women's ice hockey as a varsity sport in September 2018 along with the naming of Rob Morgan as the inaugural head coach.\n Soon after, the university announced a consolidation of the LIU Post Pioneers with the LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds to form one Division I athletic program at the university's Brooklyn campus. The current LIU program now competes as the LIU Sharks, with the new nickname having been selected by polling of alumni and students of the two campuses.\nOn September 26, 2018, LIU joined Division I Sacred Heart as well as Division II programs Franklin Pierce University, Post University, Saint Anselm College, and Saint Michael's College in the formation of the NEWHA conference. LIU becoming the sixth member of the organization allowed the NEWHA to transition from a scheduling affiliation to an NCAA hockey-only conference eligible for an autobid to the NCAA women's ice hockey tournament.\nThe team began competition in September 2019 to become the first, and only, women's NCAA ice hockey team on Long Island with 21 freshmen, one sophomore, and one junior. The Sharks played in their first exhibition game against the Metropolitan Riveters of the National Women's Hockey League on September 28. LIU's officially opened their inaugural season with the team's first NCAA games on October 4 and 5 versus the UConn Huskies, losing both contests by scores of 0-4 and 1–6. On October 19, 2019, LIU hosted top-ranked Wisconsin at Nassau Coliseum. LIU recorded its first victory on November 1, 2019 on the road at Saint Michael's with a 5–2 win; the game was also the Sharks' first conference game of the inaugural season. The Sharks finished the regular season 4th in the NEWHA with an 11–10–0 conference record. The Sharks upset top-seeded Sacred Heart in the semifinal round of the conference championship with a 3–0 win. In the NEWHA Championship game, the Sharks faced Saint Anselm in the Championship game after the Hawks defeated Franklin Pierce in a record-breaking five-overtime game. The Sharks scored the lone goal of the contest in the 2nd period then held on for 1–0 victory to earn the program's first conference tournament championship.\nDuring the 2022–23 season, LIU posted an overall record of 20–13–3 and finished first in the conference with a record of 17–4–3. They won the NEWHA tournament to receive their first bid to the NCAA women's ice hockey tournament."

Because these violations occurred between 1985 and 1988 Plattsburgh State's participation in all NCAA games during that time was vacated.\nMerrimack became the first non-Division I program to receive a bid to the Division I Tournament.
