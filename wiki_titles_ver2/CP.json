        "text": "Charles Johnson (March 31, 1949 – June 1, 2007) was an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors and the Washington Bullets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was an alumnus of Sequoia High School and then scored 1,000 points in three years at the University of California, Berkeley.\nThe San Francisco Warriors drafted Johnson in the 6th round of the 1971 NBA draft. The 6-foot-0, 170-pound point guard played with the Warriors for five seasons and part of a sixth until he was waived in early January 1978. Johnson was a member of the 1974–75 Warriors NBA championship team.\nAfter his release, Johnson was signed by the Washington Bullets in January, 1978, after a season-ending injury to Phil Chenier. Johnson averaged 8.3 points, 2.4 rebounds and 2.1 assists as a member of the 1977–78 NBA Championship team.\nElvin Hayes attributed the Bullets championship run to the acquisition of Johnson. In the last four games of the 1978 NBA finals against the Seattle SuperSonics, Johnson scored 80 points and helped Washington win the series 4 games to 3. The Bullets topped the Atlanta Hawks, San Antonio Spurs and Philadelphia 76ers to reach the championship round.\nJohnson died of cancer on June 1, 2007, aged 58."

        "title": "Scrub baseball",
        "text": "Scrub baseball (also called workup, because the fielders work their way up to bat) is a way of playing baseball with no teams. The number of players is variable, and score is not kept, as the idea is \"each against all\". Batting, pitching, and fielding are the same as in standard baseball; scrub is often used as practice for baseball, or a substitute when there aren't enough players available, between six and eleven.\nThe game is traditionally initiated by one person yelling, \"Scrubs!\" to claim the first batting position. Others quickly shout, \"Scrub One!\", \"Scrub Two!\", \"Scrub Three!\", etc. As the number of players available increases they are divided as follows:\nAs in computer language, the first item - scrub - is counted as 0. When an out is made the batter moves to the highest numbered position (e.g. five = center field); five becomes four, four becomes three, three moves to two, two moves to one, and one takes a turn as batter. However, if a batted ball is caught in the air, the fielder who catches it becomes the batter.\nWith twelve or more players the game is generally played with two teams divided as evenly as possible. Scrub baseball is a \"folk\" game with no governing body, so the rules vary locally and from game to game, thus the table is a guide to a common method of dividing the teams. Sandlot baseball games often started as scrub games until enough players arrived to switch to team play.\nIf one of the two batters reaches base, he or she must run around all the bases and score during the turn of the other. This leads to much daring base-running excitement. Sometimes the batter who reaches base returns to bat again, leaving an \"automatic runner\" on base. Automatic (invisible or ghost) runners advance the same number of bases as the batter does, and may be forced out.\nGenerally the game was called \"workup\" when there were three or four players on the batting team and everyone else in the field, with four bases in use. When one of the batters makes an out he or she joins the fielding team, the pitcher joins the hitting team, and everyone moves up a position. An exception to this takes place when a fly ball is caught. In this case the fielder and the batter swap or exchange positions and the player who caught the fly ball becomes the next batter.\nIn another version only one base is used, as in the 19th-century game of one old cat. The base is third base. The fielding positions are center field, left field, shortstop, third base, and pitcher. Two batters work together until one makes an out and is replaced. The batter on deck acts as the catcher. If no one is covering home (both batters are running), then the runner advancing homeward can be put out by throwing the ball to the plate before the runner gets there - a practice called \"crossing out\".\nIn still another variation, a volleyball or similar ball may be used and there will be no pitcher. The \"up\" player sets the ball in motion by holding it in his or her non-dominant hand, and sets it in motion by a hefty strike from the other hand. This often occurs in crowded play areas, such as schoolyards, where the use of bats and baseballs is usually banned for reasons of safety.\nPresident Warren G. Harding played scrub baseball as a boy , as did the historian Bruce Catton, and rockabilly singer Sonny Burgess ."

        "text": "2002 FIFA World Cup, sometimes known as FIFA World Cup 2002, is the second EA Sports official World Cup video game and tie-in to the 2002 FIFA World Cup, released for GameCube, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. It was developed by EA Canada and Creations, with Intelligent Games assisting the development of the PC and sixth-generation console versions, with additional assistance from Tose Software for the GameCube version. The game was published by EA Sports in North America and Europe and published by Electronic Arts Square in Japan. The GameCube version was a launch title for the system in Europe.\nOverview.\nA stepping stone between the game engines of \"FIFA Football 2002\" and \"FIFA Football 2003\", the game still incorporates the power bar for shots and crosses but with a steeper learning curve and customisation of the chances of being penalised by the match referee. Some kits are licensed, along with the player likeness and the stadia of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Unlike the previous games in the FIFA series, the game had an original soundtrack composed by Bob Buckley and performed by the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, although \"Anthem\" by Vangelis is used as one of the match entrance fanfares.\nTeams.\nThe game features each of the 32 teams that qualified for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, along with nine other national teams that did not qualify: Australia, Austria, Czech Republic, Finland, Greece, Israel, Norway, Scotland, and Switzerland. In addition to national teams, there are also all-star teams to unlock. They are: European All-Stars, African All-Stars, American All-Stars, Asian All-Stars, and World All-Stars.\nReception.\n\"2002 FIFA World Cup\" was met with positive to average reception. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 79% and 80 out of 100 for the PC version; 76.58% and 73 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version; 76.05% and 79 out of 100 for the Xbox version; 73.59% and 78 out of 100 for the GameCube version; and 68.75% and 77 out of 100 for the PlayStation version. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave the GameCube, PS2, and Xbox versions each a score of 30 out of 40.\nThe PlayStation 2 version of \"2002 FIFA World Cup\" received a \"Gold\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom. The game was an immediate hit in Italy, with sales of 90,000 units across all platforms within one day of release.\nThe game sold 3.5 million copies by October 2002.\nLawsuit.\nBayern Munich and German international goalkeeper Oliver Kahn successfully sued Electronic Arts for their inclusion of him in the game without his prior consent despite EA reaching an agreement with FIFPro, the body that represents all FIFA players. As a result, EA was banned from selling copies of the game in Germany and was forced to financially compensate Kahn."

        "title": "1997–98 Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball team",
        "text": "The 1997–98 Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball team, coached by Pat Summitt, is considered to be one of the greatest teams in the history of U.S. women's college basketball, going 39–0, and winning their third consecutive national championship, while playing one of the toughest schedules in the nation. The Lady Vols started off the season ranked number one in the nation, a ranking that would not change. ESPN called it one of the top ten moments in women's sports of the 20th century. After the season, Summitt authored a book about the season, entitled \"Raise the Roof\".\nPreseason.\nThe Lady Vols had just come off of a somewhat bittersweet season. While they had won the national championship, they had lost ten games, including two to rival Louisiana Tech. That team was the first Lady Vols team since 1991 that did not win either the SEC regular season or tournament championship.\nHowever, the team did return several players, including All-American Chamique Holdsclaw, and had a freshman class that was being called the greatest ever, which included Tamika Catchings, Semeka Randall, Teresa Geter, and Kristen Clement. Tamika Catchings won Miss Basketball titles in two states: Illinois, her sophomore year, and Texas, her senior year. Additionally, she led her high school to a state championship and a 40–0 season her senior year. She also performed a quintuple-double in one of her games. Semeka Randall was also accomplished, named Parade's Player of the Year her senior year, a two-time Miss Basketball, as well as a two-time state tournament MVP. Kristen \"Ace\" Clement came out of Pennsylvania, where she had broken Wilt Chamberlain's scoring record in Philadelphia of 2,205 with 2,256 points. The record had stood for 40 years. The fourth freshman, Teresa Geter, was not as well-known, but was considered to be the best player in South Carolina, and had been named Miss Basketball, just like the others. Chamique, Tamika, and Semeka would become known as \"The Meeks\" as the season progressed.\nRegular season.\nMississippi.\nAfter an exhibition rout of US Armed Forces, the Lady Vols opened up the season unusually, with a conference game against Mississippi. Semeka Randall did not start the game. However, four minutes into the game, the Lady Vols were only up 4–2. At this point, Randall was put into the game, and Tennessee scored fifteen straight, on a run fueled by her. Randall scored 24, and star Chamique Holdsclaw added 23. This season opener has caused a lot of anticipation, as it was expected that this would be the game where all four of Tennessee's freshman played together. However, during a November practice, Clement had injured her foot, resulting in a stress fracture. After a discussion with the team doctor, Clement agreed to sit out the Mississippi game in order to be able to play the next game, against Louisiana Tech.\nLouisiana Tech.\nThe Louisiana Tech Lady Techsters were ranked second in the country and was expected to challenge Tennessee for the national title. Tech returned all five of its starters from a team that had beaten the Vols twice the previous year. Tech came out on a 9–2 run, but led at the half by only a point. The teams played evenly for the beginning of the second half, before Louisiana Tech raised the lead to five with just over twelve minutes remaining. Summitt put her four freshman into the line-up, which went on a 12–0 run, giving Tennessee a lead they would never relinquish. Holdsclaw finished with a double-double (24 points, 11 rebounds), and Catchings contributed 17 points.\nTeresa Geter was a big contributor, as well, with five blocked shots. Clement was able to play the game, but it set her rehab back, and she would not play again for over a month.\nTennessee-Martin, Stanford, Portland, Texas, and the Big Apple Classic.\nThe next game was against Summitt's alma mater, Tennessee-Martin. Martin was naming their court after Summitt, and the game was just an excuse to attract a large number of people. Their meeting was not much of a game, as Tennessee won 73–32. Summitt's team followed this game with a 40-point rout of Vermont. The team next went on a road trip to the West Coast for their annual game against rival Stanford. Stanford lit up the court in the first half, sinking 57 percent of their shots, but it was not enough to keep the Lady Vols away. Down by one at the half, the Lady Vols played great defense in the second, allowing just five field goals and winning by 18. Holdsclaw had 25 points, and Catchings had 20. The Lady Vols next traveled to Portland, as part of Summitt's yearly effort to play at least one game near the hometown of each player. This game was meant more as a homecoming for Laurie Milligan, instead of an actual challenge, and they cruised to a 74–51 victory. December opened up with a game against rival Texas, who shot out to a 47–32 lead at halftime, and went on to win by 34, behind Catchings' 26 points. Next up was the Big Apple Classic, a home trip for Holdsclaw. The Ladies rolled over both opponents, beating George Mason and Manhattan by 30 and 50 respectively.\nSEC/Big-10 Challenge.\nThe Vols then returned home for the SEC/Big-10 challenge. Florida lost by 10 to Purdue, and the Vols' game was against Illinois. The game featured an interesting match-up as Catchings' sister, Tauja, was a sophomore at Illinois at the time. Tennessee had a horrific start as they fell behind 41–19. By halftime, the lead had been cut to 41–24, despite only shooting 23%. In the second half, Tennessee cut the lead slowly, through turnovers and defense, finally taking the lead with 9:25 remaining. The Vols ended the game with a ten-point win.\nNorthern Lights Invitational.\nThe next trip was up to Anchorage, for the Northern Lights Invitational, a three-day, eight-team tournament. The first game was an easy win against Akron, in which Summitt played her bench frequently. The semi-final game, against Texas A&amp;M, was not much more difficult. The Ladies won handily, 105–81, leading by as much as 25. Texas A&amp;M's 81 points would end up being the most a team would score on Tennessee that season. The championship game was against Wisconsin, a team ranked in the top 10, but this ranking did not mean much, as the team ended 1997 with an 87–66 victory. The Meeks were named to the All-Tournament team.\nArkansas and UConn.\nA rare New Year's Day game was played against SEC foe Arkansas, who was ranked just inside the top 25. Tennessee forced 26 turnovers, including 14 steals, en route to an 88–58 victory. This game was followed up with a home match with main rival UConn, who was ranked third in the nation. UConn led the series 4–3, but the Lady Vols had won the last matchup, and the undefeated Huskies wanted revenge. Thompson-Boling Arena seated nearly 25,000 fans, an NCAA women's record, and, as an experiment, the game was played in four quarters instead of two halves. The Lady Vols started off on a 10–0 run, but the lead was cut to 23–17 by the end of the first quarter. The second quarter saw Tennessee expand the lead, ending the quarter with a fourteen-point lead. However, UConn did not want to go away, and went on a tear in the third quarter, as a 20–7 run cut the Lady Vols lead to one point, before the team responded, ending the quarter with seven unanswered points. The final quarter was all Tennessee, and the game ended in an 84–69 win.\nSouth Carolina and Florida.\nThe team started their SEC schedule back up with a trip to South Carolina. The Gamecocks were not much of an opponent, as the ladies more than doubled their points at the half (53–26), and finished the game 94–52. This game was followed up with another highly ranked opponent, the twelfth-ranked Gators. Once again, the Vols ran a talented team into the ground, as they only allowed 18 first half points, ultimately winning by a score of 99–60.\nGeorgia, Kentucky, and DePaul.\nTennessee had a three-game road trip up next, starting with the Bulldogs in Athens. Tennessee started the game strong, grabbing the lead, and finished the half on a 13–0 run. However, Georgia came back, cutting the lead down to nine with seven minutes remaining in the game. It was at this point that Semeka Randall scored thirteen points, sealing a 96–71 victory. This is the largest margin of victory in the Lady Bulldogs-Lady Vols series. Tennessee had 19 steals in the game, while shooting over 50%, and Holdsclaw and Catchings both scored over 20. The next game, against Kentucky, also had Tennessee making a late first half run, giving them a 19-point lead at the break. This lead was never given up, as the Lady Vols won by twenty-eight. The final game of the road trip was against DePaul, a good team who was, however, missing their two best players. Without these players, it was not much of a game, as Summitt's team started the game with twenty-one straight points and ended the game with a 125–46 victory, giving the team a 20–0 record. The team's 125 points were the second most in the history of the program.\nVanderbilt and Georgia.\nThe Lady Vols returned home and resumed their SEC schedule against in-state foe Vanderbilt, who was ranked in the top 10. Throughout the first half, the game was about even, until the Lady Vols got a slight lead with under seven minutes left, which they took to the locker room, 37–31. The second half, however, started out much differently, beginning with a 20–0 Lady Vols run. Tennessee led by as many as 35 points in the game, and ended the game with an 86–54 win. Catchings was named the SEC Player of the Week for her role in the DePaul and Vanderbilt games, scoring 35 and 22 points respectively. The final game of the month was the rematch with Georgia. It ended up being a blowout. Tennessee shot better than 60%, and Holdsclaw scored more points in the first half than the entire Georgia team. Tennessee broke the 20-steal mark, as well as the 100-point mark, winning 102–43.\nAlabama, Old Dominion, and Mississippi State.\nFebruary began with another SEC match-up, this time against unranked Alabama. Starter Kyra Elzy tore her ACL during the game ending her season, during this game, while going up for a rebound. Meanwhile, Alabama was keeping close to the Lady Vols, by slowing the game down. At half time, Tennessee only had a 13-point lead. The team never did shake off the Crimson Tide, but did manage to pull out the win, 73–66. A trip to Ole Miss was next, and the team started off much better, score the first ten points of the game and having a 54–17 lead at halftime. Summitt let the bench play the rest of the game, ultimately winning 91–45. This game was followed up by a non-conference match against longtime rival Old Dominion, whom Tennessee had beaten in the previous year's national championship. The game was even for fifteen minutes, but in the last five minutes of the half, Tennessee was able to build a twelve-point lead. Holdsclaw took over the second half for the Lady Vols, scoring 24 points for an 85–61 victory, ODU's biggest loss in four years. This match was followed up with another conference game, this time against the Mississippi State Bulldogs. UT started out sloppily, and ended the half with only a nine-point lead. However, once again the team came out strong to open the second half, raising their lead and eventually had double State's points, with ten minutes remaining. The Bulldogs cut the lead to eleven, but then Summitt put Holdsclaw back in, scoring eight in a row, giving Tennessee another victory, 74–52.\nMemphis, Auburn, Vanderbilt, and LSU.\nAfter a two-day rest, the Lady Vols resumed their season with three games in five days, starting with their final non-conference opponent, Memphis, on the road. UT started strong, taking a 16–6 lead to open up the game, only to give it back up. Memphis delighted its home crowd by taking a 38–31 lead with two minutes to go in the half, but Tennessee rallied and took a two-point lead to the locker room. Once again, Tennessee pulled away in the second half, 91–65, behind three players who scored over twenty: Holdsclaw (31), Randall (21), and Catchings (20). The next game was against Auburn, a program that is traditionally competitive within the conference. Once again, Summitt's team started the game strong, leading 32–16 before Auburn woke up, cutting the lead to five by the half. However, the Tigers would not get any closer than this, as Holdsclaw's 39 points helped Tennessee to yet another win, 79–63. The final game of this stretch was the rematch with Vanderbilt, played on President's Day in front of a sellout crowd at the Commodores' quirky Memorial Gymnasium and a national television audience on ESPN. The Commodores started off strong, taking a 16–7 lead in front of their home crowd. However Tennessee responded with seventeen straight points to take the lead, and led by nine at the halftime. As in previous games, the Lady Vols made a big run to open up the second half to put the game out of reach. UT won 91–60, with UT shooting over fifty percent yet again. The final game of the regular season came against LSU, a respectable SEC team which beat the Lady Vols the previous season in Baton Rouge, but still a few seasons away from becoming a national power. Tennessee played well on Senior Night, starting with a 32–8 lead that would never be given up. Tennessee completed the season with a 90–58 win, giving them a perfect 30–0 regular season.\nSEC tournament.\nAfter their first round bye, Tennessee faced Mississippi State again. Instead of Tennessee starting quickly, however, the Bulldogs did, taking a 9–2 lead. At this point though, the Vols went on one of their runs, this time a 15–2 one. State did not recover from this, and Tennessee advanced to the semi-finals, 88–60. Catchings had a double-double by halftime. In the semi-finals, UT met Vanderbilt for the third time, with an even better performance than the previous two. Catchings again had a double-double by halftime and the team shot 6 of 7 from beyond the three-point line, as they advanced to the championship 106–45. The SEC Championship was against Alabama, who had played within seven points of the Lady Vols in their previous match-up. Alabama used the same, slow style they had previously employed, and at the break were only down by three. Tennessee was able to slowly up the lead to ten during the first ten minutes of the second period, eventually reaching a fourteen-point lead, before Alabama started a comeback, cutting the lead to five with just over forty seconds remaining. Alabama was able to score the five points, but Tennessee made their foul shots, and won the title, 67–63. After the game, Holdsclaw was named the tournament's most outstanding player. UT was now 33–0, with the NCAA tournament coming up next.\nNCAA tournament.\nOpening Games.\nThe Lady Vols were awarded the No. 1 seed in the Mideast Regional where their opponent was also undefeated. The 28–0 Lady Flames of Liberty were the champions of the Big South conference, giving them a berth in the tournament as a No. 16 seed. The usual #1-#16 blowout occurred, with Tennessee winning 102–58, although in another region this blowout did not occur: No. 16 seed Harvard upset injury-depleted No. 1 seed Stanford 71–67 in the West regional. This was the first time that a 16-seed had beaten a 1-seed in the NCAA tournament — men's or women's.\nHoldsclaw led Tennessee with 22 points, although Liberty's Sharon Wilkerson led all scorers with 26. Four other Lady Vols reached double figures, and both Holdsclaw and Catchings had double-doubles.\nUT's second round opponent was 8-seeded Western Kentucky, who had lost only by to one to Louisiana Tech in the Sun Belt Tournament, and had defeated Stephen F. Austin in the first round, 88–76. Tennessee started slowly and Randall picked up two early fouls, resulting in Ace Clement taking her place in the lineup where she scored five quick points and helped the team to a twelve-point halftime lead. Western Kentucky pulled to within six early on in the second half, only to follow their run up by going 0 for 6 on their next shots. However, the Lady Toppers pulled back within six a second time. Once again, their run was short lived, as it was followed up with a spree of turnovers. The Lady Vols took advantage of this drought, and went on to win 82–62. Holdsclaw led all scorers with 34 and Catchings contributed 20, while Le Johnson was Western Kentucky's highest scorer, with 17.\nThe Regional Finals were not all that far away from Knoxville – the Lady Vols only had to travel a couple of hours, to Nashville, where they faced 5th-seeded Rutgers, who came in with a record of 22–9. Rutgers had survived two close games to reach this point, defeating 12th-seeded Oregon, 79–76, in the first round, and then upsetting 4th-seeded Iowa State, 62–61 in the second. Their third-round game was not quite so close. Although Rutgers only trailed by two towards the end of the first period, UT was able to outscore Rutgers by six to close it out, and opened the second half up by building the lead to sixteen. The Scarlet Knights never recovered, losing 92–60. Holdsclaw and Catchings were again the leading scorers, with 25 and 23. The Lady Vols shot 52.2% from the field and forced Rutgers to 27 turnovers. This game gave Tennessee their 36th win, breaking Connecticut's record of 35, as the Lady Vols advanced to the Regional Finals.\nThe Regional Championship matched Tennessee with the 2nd-seeded Tar Heels, who were coming off of a 6-point victory over 3rd-seeded Illinois. Summitt's team started off with a 17–11 lead, only to falter and allow Carolina to tie it up at 21. Tennessee responded with a 12–6 run to end the first, but Carolina answered by opening the second half with the first seven points, giving them a one-point lead, 34–33, and the first time an opponent had held a lead over Tennessee in over three months. Carolina slowly extended the lead as the game continued, until they were eventually leading 61–49, at which point Summitt sent several players, including Holdsclaw (who was on the bench due to a poor shooting performance) back onto the floor. A minute later, Tennessee had cut the deficit to five, and by the five-minute mark the game was tied again, at 62. The teams traded baskets, tying the game at 64 and 66, before Tennessee reached a 70–67 lead, with less than ninety seconds remaining. Carolina was soon forced to start fouling the Lady Vols, who made their free throws and advanced to the Final Four, 76–70. Holdsclaw once again led all scorers, this time with 29, and Semeka Randall had 20. North Carolina was led by Wright and Reid, who had 21 and 20.\nFinal Four.\nTennessee's first Final Four game was against SEC foe, Arkansas, the 9th-seed out of the West Region. The Razorbacks had upset three different teams to reach the Final Four, Hawaii, Kansas, and 2nd-seeded Duke. Despite a poor first half shooting performance, the Vols led 39–28 halfway through the game. The second half saw the Lady Vols make over half their shots, propelling the team to the national championship with an 86–58, the largest margin of victory in the Women's National Semifinals history.\nLouisiana Tech knocked off NC State in their semifinal match, 84–65, making the national championship a match-up between the two teams that started the season ranked first and second. The game was not close. Seven and a half minutes through the first half, the Lady Vols were up by fifteen, and by halftime the score was 55–32. The 55 points was a record for most points in a half in a national championship game. Tech was not able to make a run until late in the second half, when they were able to cut the lead down to eighteen, only to see Kellie Jolly hit back-to-back three-pointers. The final score was 93 to 75. Three different Lady Vols scored twenty or more points: Holdsclaw (25), Catchings (27), and Jolly (20). Holdsclaw, who was named the Final Four MVP, her second consecutive, also won her seventh straight title (3 NCAA, 4 State). After the game, Louisiana Tech head coach Leon Balmore proclaimed this Lady Vols squad to be the \"best ever\", something Old Dominion Hall of Famer Nancy Lieberman has stated back in February. However, not everyone was positive, as ESPN analyst Mimi Griffin stated that Tennessee's dominance was becoming a detriment to the women's game.\nThe Lady Vols did not win another national championship until 2007, defeating Rutgers in the championship game in Cleveland. Tennessee lost three times to Connecticut in championship games (2000, 2003, 2004), but also suffered a humiliating loss to Xavier in the 2001 Sweet 16, marking only the second time since the NCAA first sanctioned women's basketball championships in 1982 the Lady Vols did not reach at least the Elite Eight. Connecticut would later match the Lady Vols' 39–0 mark in 2002, 2009, and 2010 before Baylor eclipsed the record in 2012 and tied by UConn themselves in 2014, as the only teams to win 40 straight games in a season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| SEC tournament\n!colspan=9 style=| NCAA tournament"

        "text": "The Pioneer Collegiate Lacrosse League (PCLL) was a conference in the Men's Collegiate Lacrosse Association (MCLA). The PCLL primarily incorporates teams in New England and New York and is divided into two divisions, Division 1 and Division 2 (formerly A &amp; B). The conference is governed by a five-member executive board and the teams that win the conference's divisional playoffs receive bids to the MCLA National Tournament. Before the 2019 season, the conference merged with the Central Collegiate Lacrosse Association (CCLA) to form the Continental Lacrosse Conference (CLC).\nHistory.\nIn the spring of 1984, players from 15 colleges competed in a club All-Star game held at Dean College. It was during this event that the idea of hosting a New England college club championship germinated. Over the next year meetings between the club lacrosse programs in the New England region were held and by the spring of 1986, four teams gathered at Dean College for a single elimination tournament. In the semi-final match-ups, Boston University defeated the University of Connecticut, 6-5, and Dean College defeated the University of Rhode Island, 14-2. That same day, Dean College became the first \"New England Club Champion\", defeating Boston University by a score of 6-5.\nAfter two years of successful tournaments, six teams petitioned the US Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) and the New England Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (NEILA) for sanctioning of the league. In 1987, Assumption College, Bentley College, Clark University, Dean College, Roger Williams University and Worcester Polytechnic Institute founded the Patriot Lacrosse League. The league's original purpose was to provide structure and legitimacy to the member teams, hoping their institutions would elevate them to varsity status. Five of those six founding Patriot League members were able to obtain their goal. During the spring of 1988, the first Patriot League Championship was played. Dean College defeated Bentley 18-9.\nThe following year, although Roger Williams departed, the University of Rhode Island and Bryant College were accepted into the league. In the spring of 1990, University of Connecticut and Northeastern University joined the league and at the USILA's request to avoid confusion with the NCAA's Patriot League, the league changed its name to the Pioneer Lacrosse League.\nThe Pioneer operated along the same lines for the next several seasons. Teams left the league to compete at the varsity level in the NCAA while new teams joined to fill their place. In the fall of 2000, the league underwent a major change by officially joining what was then known as the US Lacrosse Intercollegiate Associates (USLIA). That same year, the University of New Hampshire defeated Boston University to earn the league's first automatic qualification and represent the PCLL at its first national tournament as members of the USLIA. In St. Louis, Missouri. In 2006 the USLIA became the Men's Collegiate Lacrosse Association (MCLA).\nIn August 2018, the MCLA announced its intention to merge the Pioneer Collegiate Lacrosse League and the Central Collegiate Lacrosse League (CCLA) to form a new conference, the Continental Lacrosse Conference (CLC).\nChampionship records.\nDivision II.\n1 Division B only included one team (University of New Haven) in 2004 and therefore did not have playoffs.&lt;br&gt;2 The PCLL(B) did not receive an automatic bid to nationals.\n3 The PCLL(B) did not receive an automatic bid to nationals.\n4 Coast Guard Academy received an at-large bid to nationals."

        "title": "Bowling Green Falcons football",
        "text": "The Bowling Green Falcons football program is the intercollegiate football team of Bowling Green State University. The team is a member of the NCAA, playing at the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, formerly Division I-A, level; BGSU football competes within the Mid-American Conference in the East Division. The Falcons have played their home games in Doyt Perry Stadium since 1966. The stadium holds 24,000 spectators. In their 93-year history, the Falcons have won 12 MAC championships and a UPI national championship in 1959. The head coach is Scot Loeffler.\nHistory.\nEarly history (1919–1967).\nThe football program was born shortly after the university opened, at the time known as the Bowling Green Normal School. In the early years of Bowling Green State Normal College, common nicknames of BG athletic teams used by sports writers were “B.G. Normals,” “Teachers,” and the “B.G. Pedagogues\". The team began play in 1919 and played on a local field behind the Ridge Street School in Bowling Green, Ohio. The first team was composed of nineteen male students, over half of the 36 men that enrolled in the college. The roster included Ivan \"Doc\" Lake, who would later would give the Falcons their nickname. John Stitt served as the program's first football coach during the initial 3-game 1919 season. The first football game in BG's history was held on October 3, 1919, against Toledo University, a series that would turn into a rivalry that still exists in the present day. The game ended with a 6–0 score. The second game of the season marked BG's first road game at Defiance College, where the team dropped to 0–2 with a 12–0 shutout. In the final game of the short season the team lost to Michigan State Normal College (Eastern Michigan) 10–0. In the 1920 season, BG recorded its first score in a 10–6 loss at Findlay College. The 1920 team later recorded the program's first win, in the eighth and final game of the season, when the team defeated Kent State Normal College 7–0. \nThe team joined the Northwest Ohio League starting in the 1921 season. In the first game BG and Kent battled to a scoreless tie in a game that saw no fan attendance due to influenza epidemic. After a 7–0 win over Defiance, BG faced Findlay on October 15, 1921, in a game that set a national collegiate record in which BG scored 22 touchdowns to win 151–0 over Findlay College. Despite dropping the following game 27–0 to Ashland College, the team finished the season with a record of 3–1–1 and won the Northwest Ohio League conference championship, the first title in school history. The team would repeat as the NWOIAA Champions in 1922, 1925, 1928 and 1929.\nWarren Steller became the head coach of BG in 1924 and in his second season as head coach, BG recorded its first one-loss season in 1925. The record was repeated two seasons later, in 1927, when the team dropped its final game of the season 12–6 to Bluffton. During the same season, Ivan \"Doc\" Lake, a BG alumnus and football player on the original team, suggested the nickname “Falcons”. The nickname's popularity grew rapidly and was adopted by the school. In 1928, the Falcons recorded their first undefeated season with a record of 5–0–2. The team was led by Chet Chapman, who received the conference MVP award and also became Bowling Green's first All-American. Steller's Falcons repeated the feat just a few seasons later, in 1930, when the team went 6–0–2. The 1931 season marked the team's final year that the Falcons participated in the Northwest Ohio League. The team joined the Ohio Athletic Conference (OAC) in 1933, after it played one season as an independent team. Warren Steller's last season as head coach of BG football came in 1934. In the years after he continued to serve as the manager of the baseball team and also served as athletic director until 1941.\nThe Falcons struggled in their initial seasons as a member of the OAC, when the team recorded a losing record in three straight seasons from 1933 to 1935. The first winning record came in 1936 when the Falcons finished the season with a record of 4–2–3. In 1937, University Stadium was dedicated as the team's home stadium. The venue was located in the northeast part of campus and replaced the field and wooden bleachers with a larger capacity, permanent structure with the aid of Federal funding part of the Works Progress Administration. The new stadium did not provide much home field advantage, with BG only recording two home wins and ending the season 3–4–1. One of the team's best seasons in the OAC came in 1939 when BG finished with a record of 6–1–1. The Falcons came within a point of an undefeated season, their only loss to Capital by the score of 7–6. Robert Whittaker became head coach in 1941 and guided the Falcons to their best record as a member of the Ohio Athletic Conference when the team outscored opponents by a combined score of 173–40 and recorded a 7–1–1 overall record; and finished as one of four undefeated teams in conference play with a conference record of 4–0–1, along with Case Institute of Technology, Ohio Northern and Toledo. From 1942 until 1952 The team played independent of a conference affiliation until the university joined the Mid-American Conference (MAC). The highlight of BG's independent years came in 1948 when the Falcons went 8–0–1. The only blemish on the season came at the hands of John Carroll, when the teams battled to tie score of 13–13. Bowling Green had initial success in the new conference and finished with a record of 7–2 in the 1952 season.\nThe only losses on the season to Miami (OH) and Ohio. The success of the first MAC season was short-lived with Bowling Green only winning 3 games over the next two seasons; and in 1955, Doyt Perry replaced Whittaker as head coach.\nPerry, who attended Bowling Green and was a three-sport athlete for the Falcons and the captain of the football, basketball and baseball teams in 1931–32 returned to Bowling Green after serving as a high school coach at Upper Arlington and the offensive backfield coach of Ohio State. Perry changed the culture of the program, and focused on decreases in mistakes, penalties, fumbles, interceptions, blocked kicks and missed assignments. With the new coach and coaching style, the team's record quickly turned around and finished with a 7–1–1 record Perry's first season as head coach. In that season, the team's only loss came to the Miami RedHawks by the score of 7–0. The team outscored opponents 224–53, compared to being outscored 125–196 in the 1954 season. The team continued success into the 1956 season and recorded seven straight victories before picking up a 7–7 tie vs. Miami (OH) and finishing the season with an eight win on the season for a final unbeaten record of 8–0–1 and Bowling Green's first MAC Championship. After two successful seasons in 1957 and 1958, in which the Falcons went 13–3–2 overall between the two season, The season included conference wins over Miami, Kent State, Ohio, Toledo, and Western Michigan and non-conference opponents of Dayton, Delaware, Marshall, and Southern Illinois. BG recorded two games where the team scored 51 points, and the closest game of the season was a 13–9 win over Ohio in the last game of the season on November 21. Bowling Green finished the year with a perfect record of 9–0 and was the Mid-American Conference champion and was named small college national champion by the AP and the UPI. The next season, the Falcons began the season with a 5–0 record that included wins over MAC rivals Miami, Toledo and Kent State. And on October 29, 1960, the team got a sixth straight win on the season and seventeenth straight victory overall, beating California Polytechnic 50–6. Shortly after the victory, news spread that the Mustangs' plane crashed on takeoff when leaving Toledo. Two weeks later, the team faced Ohio University in a rematch of the championship-clinching game in the 1959 season. The Bobcats snapped the team's 18-game win streak and ended the team's chance at a second consecutive national title. With the 14–7 win, the Bobcats earned the MAC championship and went on to win the small college national championship. The Falcons went on to beat Texas-El Paso and finished the season with an 8–1 record, ranked second in the MAC. The 1961 team finishing the regular season with an 8–1 record in the regular season, the single loss to Miami (OH) by one point, 7–6. Despite the loss, the Falcons claimed their third MAC title and was selected to play in the Mercy Bowl, the program's first bowl game. The team flew to California to play Fresno State at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Proceeds of the game went to the survivors and families of the Cal Poly plane crash. The Falcons lost the game 36–6 but over $170,000 was raised for the victims.\nBowling Green repeated as MAC champions in 1962, and finished the season with a record of 7–1–1 with a 24–24 tie at Miami (OH) and a 23–7 non-conference road loss to West Texas State. In the 1963 season, Bowling Green ended with a record of 8–2, including a home loss to Miami Redskins and a road loss at Ohio. The Falcons started the 1964 season on an eight-game winning streak. In the ninth game of the season, Bowling Green faced tough rival, Ohio and was held scoreless with the Bobcats winning 21–0. The team rebounded in the final game of the season to beat Xavier 35–7 and claimed the MAC Championship. BG finished the season with a 9–1 record and outscored opponents 275–87. Perry stepped down as head coach of the football team after the 1964 season to take a position as the athletic director at the university and served in the position until 1970. He finished with an overall record of 77–11–5 and a conference record of 46–8–5 over ten seasons. During Perry's tenure at Bowling Green, he won five Mid-American Conference championships and one small college national championship. His .855 winning percentage placed Perry among the top five in college football history and he was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1988. Bob Gibson, a long-time assistant coach at BG, was hired to replace Perry as head coach of the Falcons. In the 1965 season the team again won another MAC title with a 7–2 record. The Falcons continued their winning ways under Gibson in 1966 and 1967, posting records of 6–3 and 6–4 respectively. Gibson departed Bowling Green after the 1967 season with a 19–9 record.\nDon Nehlen era (1968–1976).\nAfter one season as an assistant coach to Gibson, Don Nehlen took over as head coach for the Falcons in 1968. Nehlen played quarterback at Bowling Green from 1955 to 1957 and led the team to the 1956 MAC championship. After graduating from BG, he began his coaching career in 1958 at Mansfield Senior High School. He later served as head coach at Canton South High School and Canton McKinley High School and an assistant coach at the University of Cincinnati. The Falcons welcomed Nehlen in as head coach with a 62–8 win over Ball State and opened the 1968 season on a three-game win streak. The team finished the season 6–3–1 and followed with a 6–4 record in the 1969 season. Despite a 2–6–1 record in the 1970 season, Bowling Green rebounded back to a 6–4 record in 1971.\nThe Falcons began Nehlen's fifth season as head coach against Purdue on September 16, 1972. The game was tied in the fourth quarter when the Falcons moved into field goal range and Don Taylor kicked the ball through the uprights to give the Falcons a 17–14 upset win against a top 20 ranked opponent. In the 1973 season, BG again picked up a big opening win, at Syracuse 41–14. The Falcons' rushing game greatly improved under Nehlen. The team was led by Paul Miles, who ran for more than 1,000 yards in three consecutive seasons from 1971 to 1973. Miles teammate, Dave Preston earned a position as the career leader in rushing with 3,423 yards during his time with the Falcons. In 1975, Dan Saleet rushed for a team leading 1,114 yards. Nehlen led the Falcons added two more upsets in the Nehlen era with a 23–21 win over BYU and a 22–7 win against Syracuse in 1975 and 1976 respectively. The major wins gave Nehlen the unofficial title of the “Master of the Upset” from many BGSU fans. Nehlen left Bowling Green after the 1976 season and guided the Falcons to a 53–35–4 record in nine seasons as head coach. He went on to coach at West Virginia and coached 21 seasons for the Mountaineers and became the 17th coach in NCAA Division I-A history to record 200 victories with a 202–128–8 overall record.\nDenny Stolz era (1977–1985).\nFormer Michigan State head coach Denny Stolz was hired as the 12th head coach of the Bowling Green Falcons in 1977. He coached the team to a 22–33–1 in his first five seasons, with the first four having exactly seven losses. But in his sixth season, he coached them to a MAC title, their first since 1965, culminating with an appearance in the California Bowl, their first ever bowl game appearance. His next two seasons were both 8–3 but with no MAC titles, finishing 2nd twice.\nIn Stolz's final season, the Falcons went 11–0 in the regular season, won the MAC title, and appeared in the California Bowl once again. Stolz left his Bowling Green team out in California and never got the Falcons ready to play vs Fresno State and the Falcons were beaten for the first time all season and ended 11–1, while Stolz went to San Diego to coach San Diego State, leaving BGSU after two MAC titles and a 56–45–1 record, going 34–12–0 in his last four seasons.\nMoe Ankney era (1986–1990).\nArizona defensive coordinator and associate head coach Moe Ankney was hired as the 13th head coach of the Falcons after Stolz's departure. Ironically, despite finishing 5–6 in his first two years, they had finished tied for 2nd in the MAC. But the bottom fell out in his third season, with his team going 2–8–1 and finishing eighth out of nine teams. His next two seasons were only marginally better, finishing 5–6 and 3–5–2. After five losing seasons, Ankney resigned to become defensive coordinator at Purdue, finishing with a record of 20–31–3.\nGary Blackney era (1991–2000).\nOhio State linebackers coach Gary Blackney was hired as the 14th head coach of the Falcons in 1990. His first season ended with a 10–1 regular season, MAC title, a win in the California Bowl which was their first ever bowl win. The next season proved to be even better, as the team finished with a 2nd straight MAC title, a 9–2 regular season, and a Las Vegas Bowl victory. In 1994, his team came within one game of winning a third MAC title, before a loss to Central Michigan on a fake punt touchdown. Blackney's Falcons finished 9–2 in 1994. In his first four seasons, Blackney had coached the Falcons to a 36–8–2 record.\nBut after the Central Michigan debacle that ended that season, Blackney's record in the next six seasons was a paltry 24–42, with his last season being the worst, as they finished 2–9. Four games in with an 0–4 start, Blackney decided to quit as soon as the season ended, leaving the Falcons after compiling a 60–50–2 record.\nUrban Meyer era (2001–2002).\nIn 2001, Notre Dame wide receivers coach Urban Meyer took his first head coaching job at Bowling Green. In his first season there, the team finished 8–3, capping off the season with a 56–21 victory over Bowling Green's rival, the University of Toledo Rockets. Meyer also earned Mid-American Conference Coach of the Year honors that season.\nThe next year, Bowling Green finished with a 9–3 record. After a 17–6 overall record, Meyer left to accept the head coaching position at Utah.\nHe helped turn around a team that had gone 2–9 in 2000 in large part due to QB Josh Harris, a player tailor-made for Meyer's scheme. In part-time play in 2001, Harris threw for 1,022 yards with 9 touchdowns, and ran for 600 yards and 8 touchdowns. The next year, he threw for 2,425 yards with 19 TD and ran for 737 yards with 20 TD. Meyer later used such quarterbacks as Alex Smith at Utah and Tim Tebow at Florida in a fashion similar to the way Meyer used Harris.\nGregg Brandon era (2003–2008).\nAfter Meyer left for Utah, offensive coordinator Gregg Brandon was promoted to serve as the 16th head coach of the Falcons. In his first season as Bowling Green's head coach, Brandon led his team to an 11–3 record and a division title, appearing in the 2003 MAC title game, losing to Miami (OH). But the Falcons would play in the 2003 Motor City Bowl and win, finishing the season ranked at No. 23.While the next season was only good enough for 3rd in the MAC West, they finished 9–3 and played in the 2004 GMAC Bowl, the first time the Falcons went to consecutive bowl games since 1992.\nThey moved to the MAC East after the season, and finished the next two years 2nd and 4th respectively, with the latter being his only losing season at 4–8 in 2006. The following year, they shared the MAC East title while finishing 8–5, losing out on playing in the MAC title game due to a tiebreaker. Instead, they played in the 2007 GMAC Bowl. The 2008 season proved to be his final year in which they finished 6–6 after high expectations, being fired after his last game, a win against Toledo. Brandon finished 44–30, with two division titles but no MAC titles.\nDave Clawson era (2009–2013).\nDave Clawson had been offensive coordinator at Tennessee prior to being hired as the 17th head coach of the Falcons. His first year ended with a 7–6 record and a loss in the 2009 Humanitarian Bowl, though they played in their first bowl game in three seasons. 2010 was disastrous, as the team went 2–10. They improved to 5–7 the following year, with a marginal rise in division position.\nIn January 2010, rumors began to circulate that East Carolina was interested in Clawson for their vacant head coaching position, following former ECU coach Skip Holtz' move to South Florida. The rumors intensified following Middle Tennessee State's head coach Rick Stockstill turning down the East Carolina job after interviewing. However, Bowling Green stated that neither athletic director Greg Christopher or Clawson himself were contacted by East Carolina officials. Ultimately, Ruffin McNeill was hired to fill the position. On November 7, 2012, Clawson led the Falcons to an upset victory against division rival Ohio 26–14. The special teams had two blocked punts and forced two bad snaps which one of them rolled into Ohio's end zone to force a safety. The Falcons took advantage of these turnovers and scored 19 points (2 Touchdowns, 1 Field Goal, and 1 Safety). With the win, BG moved into 2nd place in the MAC East Division and kept their hopes alive of winning the MAC East and better yet the entire conference. They went to the 2012 Military Bowl after an 8–5 record, as expectations rose for next season. 2013 proved to be the culmination of the expectations, as the team not only won the MAC East, they also won the MAC title over Northern Illinois, their first MAC title since 1992. The team finished with a 10–4 record. Four days after winning the MAC title, Clawson left to be the next coach at Wake Forest, leaving the interim head coaching duties for the 2013 Little Caesars Pizza Bowl to special teams coordinator Adam Scheier. He left the program with a 32–31 record, a MAC title, but no bowl wins.\nDino Babers era (2014–2015).\nEastern Illinois head coach Dino Babers was hired as the 18th head football coach of the Falcons in December 2013. Babers is the first African American head coach in Bowling Green football history. Bowling Green went 8–4 in his first year with the program, winning the MAC East once again, though they lost the MAC title game to Northern Illinois, ending the regular season on a three-game losing streak. However, they did appear in the 2014 Camellia Bowl and won. It was their first bowl win since 2004. In 2015 Babers coached the team to a 10–4 record, winning the 2015 MAC Championship against Northern Illinois. Babers left the program in December 2015 to accept the head coaching position at Syracuse.\nMike Jinks era (2016–2018).\nTexas Tech running backs coach Mike Jinks was hired to replace Babers. In Jinks' first season, the Falcons finished 4–8. In his second season, the Falcons only accomplished 2 wins to their 10 losses. In what would be his final season, the Jinks-led Falcons were 1–6 after falling to Western Michigan on October 13 after holding a two-touchdown lead with 8:51 left in the third quarter. Jinks was relieved of his duties on October 14, 2018, and finished his stint at Bowling Green with a 7–24 record.\nScot Loeffler era (2019–present).\nOn November 28, 2018, Boston College offensive coordinator Scot Loeffler was named the 20th head coach at Bowling Green. During this time, the Falcons played their 100th anniversary game against the Toledo Rockets, winning 20–7. The Falcons were 27.5 point underdogs, and pulled off their first victory against Toledo since 2009. BG finished the year 3–9. In his second season, the Falcons didn't win a single game, going 0–5, in a shortened season due to the pandemic. Loeffler would pick up his biggest win as the head coach in 2021 when the Falcons beat the Minnesota Gophers 14–10 at Huntington Bank Stadium. The win would be Bowling Green's first win against an FBS team since 2019. Bowling Green would finish the season with a 4–8 record.\nIn a September 2022 loss against Eastern Kentucky, the Falcons played their longest game with seven overtimes.\nConference affiliations.\nBowling Green competes in the East division of the Mid-American Conference. Bowling Green was to move to the West division for the 2012 season, but that never occurred after Temple left the MAC for the Big East prior to the 2012 season.\nChampionships.\nNational championships.\nBowling Green was the small college national champion, as selected by both Associated Press and UPI in the 1959 small college football rankings.\nConference championships.\nBowling Green has won or shared a conference championship 17 times, including 12 times in the Mid-American Conference.\nDivision championships.\nBowling Green has won six division championships.\n† Co-champions\nBowl games.\nBowling Green has played in 14 bowl games in its history, compiling a record of 5–9 in those games.\nThe Falcons also participated in the Mercy Bowl on November 23, 1961, against the Fresno State Bulldogs (losing 36–6) though this game is not recognized as a sanctioned bowl game by the NCAA.\nHead coaches.\nHead coaches through 2023 season.\nRivalries.\nBowling Green plays the Toledo Rockets for the Peace Pipe in the annual Battle of I-75. Bowling Green's record in games played for the Peace Pipe, which date to 1980, is 15–16. Bowling Green competes against Kent State for the Anniversary Award', which was introduced in 1985.\nKent State.\nBowling Green leads the series with Kent State 61–24–6 through the 2023 season.\nToledo.\nBowling Green and Toledo have a rivalry, nicknamed \"The Battle of I-75\", dating back to 1924, when BGSU challenged the participation of Toledo's captain, Gilbert Stick, after it was discovered that Stick also played for a local team in Genoa, Ohio. Conference rules did not prohibit such play, and BGSU's protest was overruled. In 1950, Toledo's athletic director charged BGSU students a higher price for tickets at a basketball game than the general public, while rumors spread of a dog-napping attempt by BGSU against Toledo's mascot. Another incident came in 1951, when a fight broke out after a hard hit by a BGSU player on fullback Mel Triplett. Don Greenwood, then Toledo's coach, participated, and resigned after the university failed to back him up. In Greenwood's view, the officials should have called a penalty for excessive roughness, and he had a duty to protect his players. Following the 2023 season, Toledo leads the series 43–41–4.\nFuture non-conference opponents.\nAnnounced schedules as of January 27, 2020.\nBowling Green's All-time players in the NFL.\n\"All players in bold are current NFL players.\""

        "text": "Thomas Fraser Bruce (1885–1917) was a pioneer Australian rugby league footballer in the New South Wales Rugby League competition and an Australian Imperial Forces (AIF) officer who fell in World War I at the Battle of Passchendale.\nEarly life and football career.\nBorn in Braidwood, New South Wales to parents Robert and Margaret Bruce, the family relocated to Sydney. His mother later lived in the Sydney suburb of Kensington.\nA , Bruce played in nineteen matches for the Eastern Suburbs club in the years 1909-1912 alongside Dally Messenger. He was the 28th player for the Eastern Suburbs club. He is listed in the Easts playing squad from 1909 through till 1913, although Leslie Cody kept him out of the half-back spot in East's first premiership winning side in 1911. By 1912 the champion representative half-back Pony Halloway had joined the Tricolours and Bruce saw little first grade football in 1912 and none in 1913.\nWar service.\nBruce was a thirty-two-year-old married tram conductor with two adopted children living in Yurong St, near Hyde Park, Sydney when he enlisted in the AIF in March 1916. He was at that point active in the Home Service and had contributed as a camp-cook. Enlisted to the Australian 36th Infantry Battalion he rose from private to corporal with three months, and to sergeant six months later. He was wounded in action in Belgium at the Battle of Messines in June 1917 and rejoined his unit in August 1917 at which point he was promoted to 2nd lieutenant, less than eighteen months after enlistment . He was killed early in the first day of the First Battle of Passchendaele in Belgium on 12 October 1917 after establishing a forward command post. He was one of fifteen officers of the 36th Bttn killed at 1st Passchendaele.\nHe was survived by his children William and Mary and his wife May Maud Bruce. He has no known grave but is commemorated on panel 25 of the Menin Gate memorial.\nUnarguably perplexing is the military record at the AIF Project of a Thomas John Bruce born in 1898 whose father was the same Thomas Fraser Bruce of 28 Yurong St, Hyde Park. The private TJ Bruce served in a different unit to his father and survived the war. This would have made the older Thomas fourteen years of age when his son Thomas John was born. Perhaps one, or both Thomas Bruce was lying about his age at enlistment."

The school's team currently competes in the Mid-American Conference. The team last played in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in 2000.\nThe Cardinals have had various levels of success throughout their 94 seasons of competition. Although there was little success in the program from its start until the 1970s, the next two decades would be the highlight of the program's performance. Ball State became a sporadic leader in the Mid-American Conference, winning a record seven MAC tournaments between 1981 and 2000. The Cardinals also accomplished a large feat during the 2001 Maui Invitational Tournament, when they upset #4 Kansas and #3 UCLA on consecutive days. In 2017, the Cardinals beat #8 Notre Dame Fighting Irish at Purcell Pavilion by a score of 80-77, breaking a sixteen year drought against ranked teams.\nRivals.\nBall State's rivals in men's basketball are against other in-state, out-of-conference programs Butler (since 1924), Evansville (since 1929), Indiana State (since 1922), and Valparaiso (since 1927).

This group of Cardinals became the first team in the Mid-American Conference history to win two consecutive MAC regular season conference championships as well as back-to-back conference tournament titles. The 1990 Ball State basketball team also became the first team in the MAC to reach the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament in its current format. The Cardinals lost in the Sweet 16 to the eventual national champions UNLV Runnin' Rebels, 69–67.\nThe team was led by many transfer players and two of Coach Hunsaker’s key transfers, starting forwards Paris McCurdy and Curtis Kidd, were high school teammates. They both signed to play their college ball at the University of Arkansas-Little Rock. However, because of disciplinary reasons, the two had to find a new school. Former coach Rick Majerus gave them a second chance, and they came through. The two became the key assets to Ball States Sweet 16 run.\nThe Cardinals finished the regular season at 26-7 before heading to the NCAA tournament. The Cardinals were a 12 seed and began the tournament at the Huntsman Center in Salt Lake City. They upset the Oregon State Beavers in what was star point guard Gary Payton’s last game in college.

        "text": "Alexander J. McKinnon (August 14, 1856 – July 24, 1887) was an American Major League Baseball first baseman from Boston, Massachusetts. He played for several teams in his short-lived career in the National League.\nEarly career and expulsion.\nMcKinnon began his amateur career with the Boston Stars in , then joined the Syracuse Stars, and played first base for the next three seasons.\nIn , McKinnon was a member of the Troy Trojans of the National League when decided to \"jump\" his contract and play for the Rochester club of the International Association, which was against the league's policy and he was expelled for this action. This expulsion caused a ripple effect that meant that no National League team could play versus Rochester, nor could they play against teams that had played Rochester. Though this could have caused the Association a great deal of money, they stood behind the team's decision even though National League President William Hulbert had made a secret deal that allowed Rochester to reorganize and circumvent the losses. McKinnon did not play very much during that season as he was struck with sickness for much of the time.\nHe decided to quit playing baseball after the season and moved west to engage in business interests. On November 27, 1882, McKinnon was married in Boston, although the marriage produced no children. On March 5, , he was re-instated during a special session of the National League, and signed with the Philadelphia Quakers. He, again, was too sick to play and asked and received his release from the club for this reason.\nMajor League career.\nHe formally began his major league career for the New York Gothams, and led the league in games played with 116. While he hit well with a .272 batting average and 12 triples, he committed a record 53 errors at first base, for a .955 fielding percentage, a record that still stands today for the lowest percentage for a first baseman in a single season.\nMcKinnon moved on the St. Louis Maroons for the next two seasons. In , he batted .294 and significantly improved his fielding at first base with a league leading .978 fielding percentage. Also during that season, he finished out the season as the player-manager, managing the final 39 games of the season, winning only six of them. This was his only stint as manager during his career. His hitting continued to improve in , when he batted .301 and hit eight home runs. After the season, on December 1, he was traded to the Pittsburgh Alleghenys for Otto Schomberg and $400.\nLate career and death.\nThe season began with McKinnon improving his hitting and fielding, likely becoming one of the better first basemen in the National League, when he contracted typhoid pneumonia and subsequently died in Charlestown, Massachusetts at the age of 30.\nHe was interred at Lowell Cemetery in Lowell, Massachusetts. Pittsburgh wore a black crêpe on their uniforms for the rest of the season to honor Alex."

At Pelham, he was the basketball team's all-time leading scorer and the quarterback of the football team. He received no scholarship offers to play college baseball but received several scholarship offers from NCAA Division I basketball programs. It was during a recruiting trip to Drexel that he decided to contact the baseball coach at nearby Villanova University about walking on to the baseball team.\nHe played college baseball at Villanova, where he was named to the 1989 Big East Conference baseball tournament all-tournament team. In 1987, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and returned to the league in 1988 to play for the Falmouth Commodores. He was selected by the Chicago Cubs in the second round of the 1989 MLB Draft.\nIn each of his two major league seasons, Scott was the opening day third baseman for Chicago, but in each case he was back in the minor leagues within a few weeks. In 1991, Scott batted .165 until May 14, when the Cubs sent him down. On April 20, 1992, he was batting .103 when he cracked a grand slam at Wrigley Field. He was then sent down three games later. Scott was called up a few more times during that year but never reached the majors again, continuing to play in the minor leagues until before retiring."

        "text": "Robert Henderson Graves (1 September 1883 – 15 February 1958) was a pioneer Australian rugby league and rugby union player and one of his country's first dual-code internationals. He was a versatile forward for the Australia national team. He played in 6 Tests between 1908 and 1909, as captain on 1 occasion. In 1907 he played for New South Wales in the very first rugby match run by the newly created 'New South Wales Rugby Football League' which had just split away from the established New South Wales Rugby Football Union.\nRugby union career.\nGraves grew up in inner city Balmain in Sydney. He played rugby union at Fort Street School and later represented for his senior school Hawkesbury Agricultural College. From there he was graded to play rugby union with the West Sydney Juniors - an inner city club. He played with the Grosvenor Club (another inner Sydney club) until 1902. He then joined the Gipps Club in the Balmain area with whom he won the Sydney rugby union premiership in 1904.\nHe joined the Balmain club in the metropolitan rugby competition in 1905 and from there was selected to represent Metropolis (Sydney) in a fixture against Country played over Easter in 1905. He continued in a coaching role for the Grosvenor club even while himself playing rugby for those other sides from 1903 to 1907.\nRugby league career.\nGraves was one of the New South Wales rugby union players who matched up against the first professional New Zealand team, Albert Baskiville's 'All Golds' in three matches in Sydney in August 1907. He played in all three matches and along with the other Australian rebel players was promptly blacklisted by the New South Wales Rugby Union for breaching its fundamental principle of amateurism.\nGraves was at the foundation meetings of the break-away code in 1908 and was named as foundation captain of the Balmain Tigers. He led the Tigers in their first ever game on 20 April 1908 against Easts.\nGraves was selected in all three games against New Zealand for Australia's inaugural Test series of 1908. He was a member of the first Kangaroo side which toured Britain in 1908–09. He appeared in 23 games on tour including the deciding 3rd Test at Birmingham in February 1909.\nIn 1909 he played in the 1st and 3rd Tests against New Zealand in Sydney. He captained his country in the 3rd Test victory becoming at that point Australia's sixth Test captain. He is listed on the \"Australian Players Register\" as Kangaroo No. 6.\nThe second wave of Wallaby defectors to rugby league in 1909 (Chris McKivat's Olympic Gold Medal Wallabies) spelled the end of Graves' representative career. Though only 26 years old he did not play another Test. He played a further 5 seasons with Balmain retiring in 1913.\nHe was awarded Life Membership of the New South Wales Rugby League in 1914.\nDual international recognition.\nBoth the Whiticker and Whiticker/Collis references record that in 1907 Graves represented New South Wales in rugby union and in that same year came on as a replacement for John Rosewell in the Wallabies v All Blacks 1st Test in Sydney. This makes Graves a dual code rugby international and he is listed as such in the 1991 edition of the Andrews reference.\nHe is however not listed among the Australian dual-code internationals in sources such as the \"2005 Rugby League Annual\" or in editions of \"Australian Sporting Records\". Presumably (and erroneously) this may be due to his status in making his single Wallaby appearance as a reserve rather than from the run-on side."

He played in 10 Tests between 1924 and 1930 as captain on 7 occasions.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Charters Towers, Queensland, Gorman was the first Queenslander to lead a Kangaroo touring side to Britain. He has been named amongst the nation's finest footballers of the 20th century\nClub career.\nAs an old boy of St Mary's Christian Brothers College Toowoomba, Gorman first played for the Past Christian Brothers Football Club in 1918 when the club was still playing rugby union. The Toowoomba Rugby Union affiliated with rugby league in 1919 and he played with Brothers and the Toowoomba Clydesdales representative side from 1919 until 1925. In 1924–25, alongside Herb Steinohrt he was in the Toowoomba sides which beat all comers including Sydney premiers Souths, Brisbane, Ipswich and visiting representative sides including New South Wales, Victoria, Great Britain and New Zealand.\nHe moved to the Christian Brothers Football Club in Brisbane in 1926 becoming the club's first professional player. He played five seasons in Brisbane till the end of the 1930 season. Gorman played with the Christian Brothers Football Club from 1926 to 1928 and was one of the co-founders of the Past Brothers RLFC and played with them from 1929 to 1930.\nQueensland representative career.\nGorman debuted for Queensland in 1921. He played in the champion Queensland teams that defeated New South Wales in five consecutive interstate series (1922–1926).\nHe captained Queensland to a series win over New South Wales in 1928, then through to his last playing season in 1930.\nAustralian representative career.\nGorman made his Test debut against England in the 1924 Ashes series as one of seven Queenslanders to appear in the 1st Test. From 1924 to 1930 he appeared in ten consecutive Ashes tests.\nHis first appearance as captain in the 1st test loss to Great Britain in Brisbane in 1928 marked the first occasion that the Kangaroos wore jerseys of green and gold. Previously they had worn the merged blue and maroon colours of NSW and Queensland. Gorman was the first Queenslander to be named captain of a touring side when he was announced as Australian captain for the 1929–30 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain. He is listed on the Australian Players Register as Kangaroo No. 130.\nLater life.\nIn retirement, Gorman went into the hotel business in Brisbane. He served the Queensland Rugby League as an administrator.\nGorman died in 1978 and was buried in Nudgee Cemetery.\nLegacy.\nIn 2007, Gorman was inducted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame. In February 2008, Gorman was named in the list of Australia's \"100 Greatest Players\" (1908–2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia. In June 2008, he was chosen in the Queensland Rugby League's Team of the Century at centre.\nIn 2008, rugby league in Australia's centenary year, Gorman was named at centre in the Toowoomba and South West Team of the Century."

In 1967, 9 new holes were constructed, which together with the last 9 holes of the old course formed the new North Course.

        "title": "Grand Slam of Darts",
        "text": "The Grand Slam of Darts is a darts tournament organised by the Professional Darts Corporation and is known as the Mr Vegas Grand Slam of Darts for sponsorship purposes. The PDC used to invite the best performing players from its rival, the British Darts Organisation (which went into liquidation in September 2020). There have been two previous head-to-head matches between the champions of the two organisations and a few overseas tournaments have also featured BDO v PDC clashes, but this tournament is the first of its kind to be held in the United Kingdom. This arrangement lasted until the BDO's collapse into liquidation in 2020 and it is unclear whether any other organisation will be invited in future.\nSince the 2015 edition the tournament is classified as a ranking-tournament, being a non-ranking event at previous editions.\nUp until 2017, the tournament was staged each November at the Wolverhampton Civic Hall since it began in 2007. Phil Taylor won the first three finals against Andy Hamilton in 2007, Terry Jenkins in 2008 and Scott Waites in 2009. Taylor did not reach the final in 2010, losing to Steve Beaton in the quarter-finals. Scott Waites won that year, beating James Wade 16–12 in the final having trailed 8–0, making him the only BDO player to win the title. Taylor reclaimed the title in 2011, defeating Gary Anderson 16–4. Raymond van Barneveld defeated Michael van Gerwen 16–14 in the 2012 final, but Taylor regained the trophy in 2013, retained it in 2014, before losing to van Gerwen in 2015. Van Gerwen then retained it in 2016 and again in 2017 before Gerwyn Price won the trophy for the first time in 2018.\nIn May 2018, the PDC announced that the Grand Slam of Darts trophy would be renamed in honour of the recently deceased Eric Bristow.\nThat year, with renovations being done to the Civic Hall, the Grand Slam was moved to a new venue, WV Active - Aldersley formerly Aldersley Leisure Village, which is located around 3 miles north-west of Wolverhampton City Centre. Three Grand Slam of Darts events at Aldersley were won by Gerwyn Price (2018, 2019, 2021). In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the event was held at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry behind closed doors, and was won by José de Sousa. The 2021 edition saw the Grand Slam return to the WV Active - Aldersley where it has been held since. In 2023, the tournament was won by Luke Humphries.\nRecords and statistics.\nNine-dart finishes.\nFive nine-darters have been thrown at the Grand Slam of Darts. The first one was in 2008.\nPrevious BDO v PDC tournaments.\nThere have been previous tournaments in which players from both the PDC and BDO have competed. Between 1997 and 2001, several BDO players competed in the World Matchplay and the World Grand Prix – this was as a result of a 1997 Tomlin Order which allowed freedom of players to enter more events. This was later restricted from the start of 2002 onwards, when eligibility rules allowed only Professional Dart Players Association members to compete in the tournaments.\nThe 2005 Masters of Darts was the first tournament to feature the top players from each organisation. In 2006 and 2007, following Raymond van Barneveld's move to the PDC, the Dutch organisers of the International Darts League and World Darts Trophy invited some top PDC players to compete alongside BDO players.\nPerennial participants.\nAs the Grand Slam is an invitational tournament for players who have reached major finals and semi-finals, or been the top of their countries' respective rankings, there is a certain degree of prestige attached to qualifying for the tournament, and even more for entrants who qualify multiple times. Gary Anderson and James Wade qualified for 15 successive tournaments between 2007 and 2021, before missing their first event in 2022.\nTelevision coverage.\nITV screened the first four editions of the Grand Slam of Darts, which ended their 19-year absence from regular darts coverage (although they did show a one-off Clash of Champions match between Phil Taylor and Raymond van Barneveld in 1999). The inaugural event saw selected first-round games, the semi-finals, and the final all screened live on ITV1 and the rest of the tournament live on ITV4 but the live coverage was moved entirely to ITV4 in subsequent years, with highlights packages being the only coverage of the event on ITV1.\nThe tournament proved popular on ITV4, with the 2009 event achieving nine out of the top ten places in the channel's output for that week. Viewing figures ranged from 208,000 to 435,000 with the final itself watched by 454,000. ITV extended their contract with the PDC to show the tournament until at least 2010.\nThe presenting team consisted of lead presenter Matt Smith, and analysts Alan Warriner-Little and Chris Mason (who replaced Steve Beaton in 2008). The commentating team included Stuart Pyke, who also commentates on darts for Sky Sports, boxing commentator John Rawling, and Peter Drury. Janie Omorogbe provided reporting duties and player interviews.\nOn 25 January 2011, it was announced that Sky Sports would broadcast the event until 2018. Sky continues to air the event with its current deal running until 2025.\nSponsorship.\nThe sponsors of the event were PartyBets.com (2007) and PartyPoker.com (2008–09), websites operated by Bwin.Party Digital Entertainment, the Daily Mirror newspaper (2010), William Hill (2011–13), Singha Beer (2014–16), bwin (2017–18) and BoyleSports (2019–2020). Cazoo took over as sponsors from 2021, as part of a deal where they will also sponsor the PDC World Cup of Darts and the European Championship."

        "title": "Canadian ice hockey stamps",
        "text": "Ice hockey has been a key element of Canada's cultural and social history. This has been captured on various releases from Canada Post. In 1956 Canada Post Office released a 5¢ stamp paying tribute to Canadian hockey players for \"the prestige they have earned for Canada in international competition.\" Releases of the late 20th century included the commemoration of the XV Olympic Winter Games held in Calgary, a three-stamp set honouring the 75th anniversary of the National Hockey League, the 100th anniversary of the Stanley Cup, and the 25th anniversary of the 1972 Summit Series. In the 2000s, the key release has been the series of National Hockey League All-Stars. The series lasted from 2000 to 2005. Other hockey issues have included a commemorative envelope to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the International Postal Hockey Tournament and a stamp to commemorate the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah featured a hockey player.\nNational Hockey League All-Star Stamps.\nThe world of sports is not without its celebrations in the 2000 millennium year, and perhaps first among them was the 50th National Hockey League (NHL) All-Star Game. Held on February 6, 2000 in Toronto, host city of the first official all-star game in 1947, the match was the centrepiece of the all-star weekend at the Air Canada Centre. In honour of this historic Canadian event, Canada Post is proud to present a commemorative six-stamp issue featuring some of this country's greatest hockey stars.\nAvailable as a 6-stamp souvenir sheet with a souvenir folder, the same 6-stamp souvenir sheet without a folder, and on an OFDC three-pack, this domestic-rate release pays tribute to a tradition that reaches back to hockey's early days. The souvenir sheet features an All-Star lineup of Canadian hockey greats including Wayne Gretzky \"The Great One\", Gordie Howe \"Mr. Hockey\", Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard, Doug Harvey, Bobby Orr and Jacques Plante.\nEarly all-star matches were staged to raise funds in support of the families of ailing or deceased players. The first such game took place on January 2, 1908, when the Hod Stuart Memorial Match was held for the family of the late Montreal Wanderers defenseman who had died in a diving accident. The NHL tradition of selecting first- and second-team all-stars began in 1930-31 season. Three years later, the Toronto Maple Leafs defeated an NHL all-star team 7-3 in a match to benefit Toronto forward Ace Bailey and his family. Bailey's career had ended a few months before when he fractured his skull during a game in Boston. The 50th game falls in 2000 though the tradition of an annual all-star game began 53 years ago. Two matches were pre-empted by speciality series - the 1979 Challenge Cup and Rendez-Vous '87.\nCombining canvas illustration and computer design, artists Dan Fell and Vincent McIndoe joined forces for the 50th NHL All-Star Game issue. Action vignettes featuring the players appear to emerge from the spotlighted ice surface, drawing attention to the famous careers brought together for this special all-star game. The all-star logo is flanked by vignettes of the silhouettes of Maple Leaf Gardens and the Air Canada Centre - sites of the first and 50th HNL All-Star Game. Each star in the row of five along the bottom of the souvenir sheet symbolizes ten years of All-Star match-ups.\nNHL 75th Anniversary Stamps.\nA Prestige Booklet containing three stamp designs of different sporting eras will be issued on October 9, 1992 to mark the 75th anniversary of the National Hockey League. With informative text and illustrations, the 25-stamp booklet covers three outstanding eras of the league's history: first the early years (1917–1942); the six-team years (1942–1967); and the expansion years (1968–1992).\nThe first stamp shows hockey-related artifacts like an early puck, a stick and a pair of goalie skates. The player is Babe Siebert from the Montreal Maroons. The next stamp displays the crests of the six teams competing between 1942 and 1967. The vignette portrays Claude Provost and Terry Sawchuck. The third illustrates Jacque Plante's famous goalie mask, his last.\nThe original NHL was founded in November 1917 as a means to disband the old National Hockey Association and discredit Toronto owner Eddie Livingstone. Initially the league boasted five teams, including the defunct and recently resurrected Ottawa Senators. By 1926 it had expanded south, with both a Canadian and an American division. As the game and the league continued to evolve, many changes were made, including the mandatory sweater number in 1930, the goal green light in 1938 and the red line in 1943.\nThe Series of the Century, 1972.\nWith 34 seconds left in Game 8 of the 1972 Summit Series between Canada and Russia, Paul Henderson scored the goal that gave Canada the 6-5 lead. The detail of the goal includes Phil Esposito intercepting the puck and firing a shot toward the net. By this time Henderson had picked himself up off the ice, picked up Esposito's rebound [and] fired the puck at Tretiak. The Soviet goalkeeper got a toe on the shot but lost his balance as he made the save. Henderson pounced on the rebound and dribbled the puck under a prone Tretiak just as Liapkin reached him.\nTo celebrate the 25th anniversary of the 1972 Canada-Soviet hockey series and the momentous day in the history of Canada's favourite pastime, Canada Post released \"The Series of the Century\" commemorative stamp issue. Designed by Charles Vinh of Montreal, the set of two domestic-rate stamps depicts Team Canada's thrilling victory exquisite illustrations, adaptations of photographs taken by Montreal's Denis Brodeur. The first stamp, features the immediate aftermath of the all-important goal. Sports hero Paul Henderson raises his arms in jubilation against the backdrop of the Russian team net. The second stamp captures the team in a congratulatory huddle after the game.\nCanada Post also released a pane of 10 stamps with both designs. On top of this, Canada Post issued a pane of 10 stamps with an overprint of two hockey sticks, a puck, and Paul Henderson's signature. The overprinted panes were only available as part of a Canada Post special collector's gift box that contained a Paul Henderson signed hockey puck, poster, sweatshirt with \"The Goal\" on the front, and the overprinted pane of 10 stamps. The number of gift sets issued is not known, but the issue price for the gift box was $39.95 at Post Offices. The overprinted pane is now valued in the Unitrade Canadian Stamp Catalogue at $100.00, while the boxed set is valued at $125.00. The normal pane of the ten stamps is valued at just over $10.00 Canadian."

        "title": "Linden Park Cricket Club",
        "text": "Linden Park Cricket Club (LPCC) is a cricket club based at Higher Cricket Ground, Fir Tree Road, Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England.\nThe club has a senior section which runs five Saturday league teams, with the top two sides playing in the Kent League, the 3rd, 4th and 5th sides playing in the Sussex Cricket League. It also runs two Sunday sides, one of which plays in a development league for part of the season, and a midweek side.\nThe club also has a junior section which fields five sides each week across the age ranges Under 9s to Under 15s.\nLocation.\nFor over 100 years the Higher Ground cricket pitch, overlooked by the Wellington Rocks, has been a jewel in the centre of the Common. Situated in the centre of Tunbridge Wells, the Common provides a tranquil open space amidst the hustle and bustle of this beautiful and historic spa town.\nThe beauty of its location and its friendly welcome mean that LPCC is one of the highlights on the fixture list for all of its visiting teams. On a typical summer weekend, an estimated 3,000 people realise that there is no better place than one of the many benches around the ground to slow down and relax in the sun to the sound of leather on willow.\nHistory.\nCricket has been played on Tunbridge Wells Common for over 200 years with the first recorded game taking place in 1782 between Tunbridge Wells and Groombridge. In 1876 Lewis Luck formed a cricket club known as Tunbridge Wells Juniors, initially playing near the present Nevill Ground. Following the opening of the Linden Park estate the club moved to the Lower Ground and changed their name to Linden Park Cricket Club. In 1898 the club moved to the present location on the Higher Ground, where it remains today.\nIn 1882 a United England XI (W G Grace captain) played Australia at the Higher Ground. The visitors were bowled out for 49 by a team including local legend John Harvey.\nIn 1927 LPCC played against a Frank Woolley XI with 6,000 spectators.\nOn 19 June 1941, 1,500 people watched LPCC beat a British Empire XI but the following year the \"Empire fought back\", beating LPCC.\nOn 6 May 1949 a match against Kent saw Les Ames make 91 out of 226 but unfortunately the team was bowled out for 71 in reply.\nFurther matches against Kent and visiting academy and national sides (including West Indies) took place in the following years.\nDevelopment of youngsters.\nThe club's most important role is to encourage, assist and develop junior cricket in Tunbridge Wells. Its links to local schools are important and it is committed to this going forward. The club welcomes players of all standards and ages from 7 upwards. A team of qualified coaches under Brian Gasking manages teams at Under 9, 11, 13 and 15 who each have a full programme of both competitive matches and friendlies where the emphasis will be on ensuring \"everyone takes an active part\". Every Friday evening from April to September the cricket pitch is full of children playing as up to 130 boys and girls turn up to enjoy coaching where the emphasis is on learning – with fun. Their parents seem to enjoy it too as in most weeks many stay throughout the evening chatting and enjoying a well-earned drink in the beautiful surroundings of the Common.\nPavilion.\nA central feature of the local community with over 300 players of all ages, Linden Park Cricket Club and its welcoming 130-year-old clubhouse provided a quintessential sense of British history complementing the beautiful Georgian and Victorian architecture of the town. However, in 2006 the club's Pavilion was destroyed in an arson attack. Fixtures for the season were in place, pre-season practice was completed, the days were getting longer, the sides for the first matches were selected and the pitches were cut. Everything was in place – but at around 3am on 14 April, \"Good Friday\", and the day before the first game of the season, an alarm was raised – vandals had broken into the pavilion and set fire to it. Unfortunately, though a beautiful old structure designed to fit into the surroundings, the structure was 130 years old and made out of wood. Despite the best efforts of the fire services, the building was completely wrecked. Changing, showering, cooking and bar facilities, not to mention somewhere to hide from the rain, the very heart of the club had been taken away in just a couple of hours. The match the next day (15 April) had to be cancelled.\nHowever, that was the only one to be cancelled all season. Members and friends all helped and opposing teams demonstrated huge understanding and support for the club's plight. Emergency equipment was found. Mowers and groundskeeping tools and storage containers to put them were organised. Portable units for changing and the all-important bar were found. The Club did not live in the lap of luxury but it did survive.\nAfter a mammoth fundraising effort covering nearly two years, the rebuilding of the clubhouse commenced in 2007 in time for the 2008 summer, a real 'Phoenix from the Ashes' moment for the local community.\nRecent years.\nSince the rebuild of the Pavilion and its opening on 13 July 2008, the club's membership has increased, particularly at junior level where the club has a huge base. Onfield results have also improved with three promotions in a row for both the Saturday Kent League sides, meaning that for the 2013 summer both will play in the second tier of the Kent League - the highest level the club has reached for several decades.\n2012 also saw a promotion for the Saturday 4th team, and for the Sunday Development League team."

        "text": "Brian Richard Williams (9 July 1960 - 7 February 2007) was a Welsh international rugby union player.\nLife and career.\nWilliams was born in Penffordd, near Maenclochog in Pembrokeshire, into the West Wales farming community. He began playing rugby at Ysgol y Preseli, Narberth RFC and Pembrokeshire RFC, with his brothers John and Anthony. His nephew Andrew is currently a rising star at scrum-half in Narberth's youth set-up, and side player for Wales Under 21 side.\nWilliams was spotted and signed for Neath RFC. During a single major club career which spanned 16 years, Williams played for the club more than 250 times. He made his debut as a first-class player in 1983, against Bridgend RFC, and went on to become one of the club's most popular players. He played as a prop, despite his relatively light build (6'1\" tall and weighing little more than 14 stone) which belied his incredible strength - Gareth Llewellyn said that Williams was \"the fittest and most powerful man\" he ever played rugby with. Williams was one of three players in Neath's \"farming\" front row, alongside his near neighbours Kevin Phillips and fellow prop Jeremy Pugh, later replaced by neighbour John Davies. Williams played in the Neath side that was Welsh Club Champions in 1986/7, 1988/9 and 1989/90, won the inaugural Welsh Premier Division title in 1990/1, and also won the WRU Challenge Cup in 1988/9 and 1989/90. Williams featured in the Neath side that set new world records for tries (385) and points (1917) in the 1988-89 season; and played for the club against several international touring sides.\nHis build may have delayed him being selected to play for Wales, and he had to wait for his international debut until 1990, by which time Neath coach Ron Waldron had taken charge of the Welsh team. He made his first appearance for Wales in a Five Nations match against Scotland in Cardiff on 3 March 1990. He played in five international matches, all defeats, his final international being the Five Nations match against Scotland at Murrayfield on 2 February 1991. When Ospreys prop Duncan Jones led Wales for the first time in June 2006, he said that he had \"always looked up to Brian Williams in the way he played.\" Williams retired from the first-class game in 1995 to run his dairy farm, having played over 250 games for Neath.\nDeath.\nWilliams died at the age of 46 in Llangolman, in Pembrokeshire of a suspected heart attack, having been actively involved in a club reunion at The Gnoll rugby ground only four days earlier. He was survived by his wife and two daughters."

        "text": "Terrance Paul Richardson (born May 7, 1953) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender. He played 20 games in the National Hockey League with the Detroit Red Wings and St. Louis Blues between 1973 and 1979. The rest of his career, which lasted from 1973 to 1981, was spent in the minor leagues. Richardson was selected 11th overall by Detroit in the 1973 NHL Amateur Draft.\nCareer.\nRichard began his career with the New Westminster Bruins during the 1971–72 season. He recorded three shutouts that year with a 3.06 goals against average (GAA). He had a record of 31–22–5 in 1972–73.\nIn 1973, Richardson was selected in the first round by the Red Wings. Richardson played in nine games that year finishing with one win and four losses and a dismal 5.33 goals against average. He was sent down to the Virginia Wings of the American Hockey League for conditioning and even was sent to the United Kingdom for a short time to play for the London Lions. The following year he returned to the Wings, but his skill did not. Richardson played only four games for the club and ended with a 6.83 GAA and one win before being sent back down to Virginia. The following season was no better, as the one NHL game that Richarson started ended in a loss with the score of 7–0 going to the Boston Bruins. He spent the rest of that year playing of both the Springfield Indians and the New Haven Nighthawks of the AHL.\nThe Red Wings decided to give Richardson one last shot with their club as he would start five games in the 1976–77 season, but again would disappoint, ending with one win and three losses. Richardson spent the rest of that year with the Kalamazoo Wings of the International Hockey League, leading them into the playoffs. However Kalamazoo would get knocked out in the second round. In 1977–78, Richardson played for the Kansas City Red Wings of the Central Hockey League, where he played a full season but finished with a 27–32–2 record.\nOn July 26, 1978, Richardson was signed as free agent by the St. Louis Blues, and found himself playing for their farm team, the Salt Lake Golden Eagles. Here he would have his best season to date, finishing with a 30–7–3 record in 40 games and leading the Eagles to the top of the CHL. He would even get called up for a single game with the Blues, but again watched as puck after puck got by in a 9–1 loss at the hands of the Minnesota North Stars.\nIn the summer of 1979, Richardson was involved in two trades. One from the Blues to the New York Islanders (along with Barry Gibbs) for future considerations on June 9 and from the Islanders to the Hartford Whalers for Ralph Klassen on June 14. He finished his career within the Whalers organization as he posted a 15–22–7 record in 46 games while playing again for the Springfield Indians in the 1979–80 season."

He was also a member of the Buffalo Bills. He is the younger brother of Pro Football Hall of Famer Merlin Olsen.\nHigh school.\nOlsen was born to Lynn Jay and Merle Olsen. He attended Logan High School in Logan, Utah from 1963 to 1966. He was a three-year starter on the varsity football team as defensive tackle and offensive tackle. An all-around athlete, he earned eight varsity letters in football, basketball and track. While a Logan High Grizzly, Olsen was voted All-Division, All-Region, All-State, and All-American recognition in football, as well as being voted All-Division, All-Region in basketball (averaging 18 points a game as a senior). He was on the top 100 recruits list in football in 1966. He received over 40 college football scholarship offers, and made campus visits to Stanford, the University of Iowa, University of Utah, Brigham Young University, and Purdue University.\nCollege.\nPhil Olsen was a three-year letterman and three-year starter, and in 1969 was a consensus All-America selection for the Utah State University Aggies, in Logan. Olsen was an Alpha Sigma Nu Honorary as one of top 12 USU Seniors, 1970, and like his brother Merlin is a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. Olsen was also the Aggie Team Captain, 1969 Team MVP, and the 1969 USU Athlete of the Year. He received the Wayne Estes Memorial Award, 1970 for \"Top USU Student/Athlete/Citizen\". His jersey No. 90 was retired in 1970. After his senior season he played in the East West Shrine Game, the Hula Bowl, and College All-Star games.\nIn Olsen's junior year of 1968 the Aggies were 7–3 and had wins over the University of Wisconsin, Memphis State University, West Texas State, Utah and BYU. He was voted honorable mention All-America honors that season.\nIn his sophomore year of 1967 the Aggies were 7–2–1 and were seven points from a 10–0 season. USU lost to Colorado State University 16–14 on a controversial officiating call that cost the team a potential game-winning field goal attempt. The Aggies also lost to New Mexico State 10–9 on a failed two-point conversion that tipped off the receiver's hands in the end zone, which would have won the game. USU tied Wichita State 3–3 in the season opener, in which the Aggie defense held Wichita State to 65 total yards and −2 yards rushing. (Former Dallas Cowboys and Miami Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson was the WSU coaching staff at that time.) Wichita State amassed only 65 yards in that game, the third-best effort in USU history. The Aggies held San Diego State University to −5 yards rushing and the University of the Pacific to −35 yards rushing, setting the then school record in that category in the process.\nOlsen was co-captain of the freshman football team and played on the freshman basketball team as well (freshmen were not allowed to play NCAA varsity sports until 1972). Dale Brown, of LSU fame, was Olsen's hoops coach as a freshman. That 1966–67 freshman basketball team still holds the record for most wins by a freshman team at USU.\nOlsen was inducted into the State of Utah's Sports Hall of Fame in 1985, and was a member of USU's All-Century Football Team. Inducted into the Utah State University Sports Hall of Fame in 1994. &lt;ref&gt;"

        "text": "Chris Hatcher (born February 18, 1973) is an American football coach and former player. He is the head football coach at Samford University, a position he has held since 2014. Hatcher served as the head football coach at Valdosta State University from 2000 to 2006, Georgia Southern University from 2007 to 2009, and Murray State University from 2010 to 2014. His Valdosta State Blazers won the NCAA Division II Football Championship in 2004. Hatcher played college football as a quarterback at Valdosta State from 1991 to 1994.\nPlaying career.\nA two-time All-American quarterback at Valdosta State University, Hatcher threw for 11,363 yards and 121 touchdowns during his stellar career. During his senior year in 1994, he led the Blazers to their first-ever postseason berth, advancing to the quarterfinals. When his career was completed, Hatcher set 29 VSU passing and total offense records. Among the national records he once set were a 68.5 career completion percentage and streak of 20 straight completions in a game against New Haven.\nHatcher was also successful in the classroom. Twice he received the Gulf South Conference’s Commissioner’s Trophy (which is awarded to the league’s Most Outstanding Student-Athlete). He finished his senior year by winning several national honors including: the NCAA Top Eight Award, the CoSIDA Academic All-America National Player of the Year and a postgraduate scholarship from the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall of Fame. In 1994, he won the Harlon Hill Trophy, awarded to the NCAA Division II National Player of the Year. Hatcher graduated from Valdosta State in 1995.\nCoaching career.\nValdosta State.\nThe winningest coach in Blazers' history, Hatcher was 76–12 at his alma mater. When Hatcher took over as head coach in 2000, he wasted no time molding the Valdosta State program into the \"Hatch Attack\". In his first year back at VSU, Hatcher took a 4–7 squad the previous year and turned it around to a 10–2 record (8–1 in GSC action) and berth in the Division II playoffs. Hatcher’s coaching staff at Valdosta State in 2000 included future SEC head coaches Will Muschamp and Kirby Smart.\nHis 2001 and 2002 teams posted back-to-back undefeated records during the regular season, part of a Gulf South Conference record 35 straight victories during the regular season.\nDuring the 2004 championship season, the Blazers lost their season-opener before rattling off 14 consecutive victories, capped by a 36–31 victory over Pittsburg State in the title game. Hatcher was named \"National Coach of the Year\" by the American Football Coaches Association and was the offensive coordinator for the East squad at the Hula Bowl.\nIn 2005, Valdosta opened the season ranked No. 1 for four straight weeks and saw the season culminate with a sixth-straight NCAA postseason appearance. Despite an 8–2 record in 2006, the 10th-ranked Blazers did not receive an invitation to the playoffs, marking the first time that occurred in the Hatcher era.\n2006's team finished sixth nationally in passing offense (283 yards per game), 12th in scoring offense (34.9 ppg) and 19th in total offense (389.9 yards). However, Hatcher’s teams have been successful in all three facets. The 2006 defense ranked 27th nationally in scoring defense (15.7 points allowed) while the special teams ranked third in punt returns (17.3 yards) and blocked seven kicks.\nGeorgia Southern.\nGeorgia Southern Director of Athletics Sam Baker announced the hiring of Hatcher as head football coach in January 2007.\n\"There were a lot of qualified candidates, but Chris Hatcher was someone I felt embodied all we were looking for,\" said Baker. \"Chris has a proven track record as a head coach – capturing the national championship in 2004 and recording an .864 winning percentage during his seven-year tenure at Valdosta State. I looked for a coach who knows how to win and I believe Coach Hatcher can do that at the Division I level. I also wanted to hire a coach with strong recruiting ties in Georgia and Florida. Coach Hatcher knows the area well… Our Athletic Department’s charge was to go out and hire a head coach that will improve on the progress we made off the field, and have that translate to on-the-field success. I think we have that coach in Chris Hatcher.\"\nOn November 21, 2009, Georgia Southern Athletic Director, Sam Baker, announced the firing of Hatcher after the 2009 season.\nMurray State.\nOn December 21, 2009, Murray State University Athletic Director, Allen Ward, announced the hiring of Hatcher beginning the 2010 season. In his first year at Murray State Hatcher led the Racers to a 5–3 record in the Ohio Valley Conference (tied for fourth place), and a 6–5 record overall. 2010 was the Racers first winning season since 2004. Went 7–4 in the 2011 season.\nSamford.\nOn December 10, 2014, it was announced that Hatcher would be the new head coach of the Samford Bulldogs. He replaces Pat Sullivan, Samford's all-time leader in wins, who resigned mainly due to health reasons. Former Samford coaches include Bobby Bowden (later head coach at West Virginia and Florida State), Wayne Grubb (who led Samford to the NCAA College Division West Region II Championship in 1971), and Terry Bowden (later head coach at Auburn, North Alabama and Akron).\nPersonal life.\nHatcher and his wife, Lori, also a graduate of Valdosta State, are the parents of a son, Ty, and a daughter, Talley Ann."

        "text": "Mitcham Cricket Green is a cricket ground in Mitcham, south London (historically in Surrey). It is the home of Mitcham Cricket Club and is reportedly the oldest cricket ground still in use, having been used for cricket since 1685.\nHistory.\nIn the 19th century, the Australian cricket team would stay at \"The Cricketers\" pub which formerly overlooked the green and practise on the green whilst on tour. The pub was used as the \"pavilion\" for the matches on the Cricket Green up until the current pavilion was built in at the beginning of the 20th Century, the scorer having a position on the balcony of the inn. The Cricketers pub was destroyed by an incendiary bomb in WW2 (which fell between the pub and the adjacent Vestry Hall - which still stands). A replacement pub was built post-war, but has since been demolished and there is a block of flats on the site. The present pavilion was built in 1904 and is rare in being one of only a few cricket pavilions to be separated from the ground by a road, (the A239).\nSurrey County Cricket Club first used the ground in 1949 for a match in the Minor Counties Championship. Surrey continued to use the ground for 2nd XI matches until 1973. Its first usage in the Second XI Championship was for a match in 1959. Surrey has never used Mitcham for a first-class match.\nIn September 1919 the Green hosted a Mitcham v Australian Imperial Forces XI match (the final game of the AIF XI tour of England), the Australian team on the day included 3 players who subsequently played Test cricket for Australia. In 2019 Mitcham CC hosted a team from the Australian Embassy to commemorate the centenary of this match.\nThe match on the Green which is reputed to have drawn the biggest crowd was a women's game Surrey v Australia in 1937 where press reports suggest that a crowd in excess of 10,000 was present. This was the last game of the Australia tour. Women's cricket has been played regularly on the Green, including a warm up game for the 1973 World Cup (Surrey v Jamaica). The most notable match of recent times was the Golden Jubilee Challenge Match, a match held between Mitcham and Hambledon Club, two of the oldest clubs in the country, in honour of the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II. Ian Botham made a guest appearance with the Queen's Jubilee Baton. The match was a two innings affair.\nLocal government.\nThe Cricket Green also lends its name to the nearby area, and is a Conservation area and council ward."

        "text": "The Trinidad and Tobago Pro Bowl, or commonly known as the Digicel Pro Bowl for sponsorship reasons, is a knockout football tournament for teams in the TT Pro League. The competition is played during May following the conclusion of the Pro League season. The Pro Bowl began without a sponsor during the competitions's first two years. It was not until 2006, when Courts began providing monetary prizes, that the tournament had its first sponsor. Following a pullout by Courts after three years, Digicel became the new branding partner of the competition. The prize money for the winner, as announced by TT Pro League CEO Dexter Skeene, is determined by the players, the clubs and the communities. With this programme the communities are expected to adopt the clubs and pledge their support to them during the tournament. The prize money will be the amount received from gate receipts and TT$100,000, courtesy of tournament sponsors Digicel.\nBeginning in 2012, the winner of the previous year's Pro Bowl will open the following TT Pro League season in the Digicel Charity Shield against the defending Pro League champion. In the case that the league champion also wins the Pro Bowl, then the Charity Shield is contested by the top two teams in the previous league season.\nW Connection is the most successful club in the Pro Bowl having claimed the title four times. In fact, the \"Savonetta Boys\" are the current holders of the Pro Bowl after defeating North East Stars 4–3 in a penalty shoot-out in 2013 after the match ended in a scoreless draw, and winning again in 2014.\nHistory.\nThe tournament was dominated by San Juan Jabloteh and W Connection in its first four years. The Pro Bowl served as a continuance of the rivalry between the two clubs. Although the \"Savonetta Boys\" claimed the inaugural tournament in 2004 and winning again in 2007. The \"San Juan Kings\" secured the Pro Bowl title in consecutive seasons in 2005 and 2006 over their rivals. In 2008, Caledonia AIA became the first club besides San Juan Jabloteh or W Connection to claim the title. Joe Public became the second club in 2009 after defeating Caledonia AIA on penalty kicks. The \"Eastern Lions\" repeated as winners in 2011 before shortly afterwards withdrawing from the TT Pro League. The following year, Defence Force claimed their first Pro Bowl after a 5–2 win over Caledonia AIA in 2012.\nFormat.\nThe competition is open to all clubs in the TT Pro League and is divided into three rounds consisting of single-legged matches. \nDuring the first two years of the competition, eight and seven clubs, respectively, representing the Pro League entered the tournament. In 2006, with the expansion of the league to include ten teams, the Pro Bowl added the qualifying round to narrow the teams to eight before the quarterfinals. In 2009, the draw for the knockout tournament was based on club's finish in the 2009 season. The bottom four teams entered the tournament at the qualifying round and the top six teams were automatically entered the quarterfinals. However, with the contraction of the league to eight teams with the 2010–11 season, the qualifying round was eliminated and all eight teams now enter the competition in the quarterfinals. As of the 2017 tournament with ten teams in the TT Pro League, the four lowest teams in league position at the start of the tournament will enter a qualifying round, where the two winners will advance to the quarterfinals.\nMatches in all rounds are single-legged played for 90 minutes duration, at the end of which if the match is still tied, a penalty shootout is used to determine the match winner.\nSponsorship.\nThe Pro Bowl has been sponsored since 2006. The sponsor has been able to determine the competition's sponsorship name. The list below details who the sponsors have been and what they called the competition:"

These were played from 26 December 1993 to 1 February 1994. The tour was the first made by the South Africa cricket team to Australia in 30 years and was undertaken as the apartheid system was being dismantled in South Africa and the country transitioned to democratic government. Kepler Wessels captained the South Africans in the first two tests. After a hand injury, Hansie Cronje replaced him for the third test. Allan Border was Australia's captain for the series.\nBefore the test series, the South Africans played four matches in the tri-nation ODI tournament with Australia and New Zealand. After playing a warm-up match against a Queensland eleven, they played in the yearly Boxing Day test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, which ended in a draw. The second test played at the Sydney Cricket Ground saw South Africa claim a five run victory before Australia came back in the third test at Adelaide Oval winning by 191 runs to tie the test series at 1–1. Mark Taylor finished as the series' leading run scorer with 304 runs. Fellow teammate Shane Warne ended taking the series' most wickets with 18.\nBackground.\nThe South Africa national cricket team toured Australia in the 1993–94 season to play three test matches against Australia in Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide from 26 December 1993 to 1 February 1994. This was the first tour made by the South Africa cricket team to Australia in 30 years and was undertaken as South Africa's apartheid system was being dismantled and the country transitioned to democratic government. Kepler Wessels captained the South Africans in the first two tests. After a hand injury, Hansie Cronje replaced him for the third test. Allan Border was Australia's captain for the series.\nThe Australians and South Africans had different set-ups before the historic tour. The Australians had competed in a three-test series with New Zealand winning the series 2–0 after taking test wins at Hobart and Brisbane. Shane Warne was the leading wicket-taker for the series with 18 wickets. On the flip side, the South Africans competed in the 1993 Hero Cup in India with the same squad they were sending to the tour of Australia. After finishing the round-robin stage in second place, they were eliminated by the host nation.\nOne of the talking points that Rick Allen of \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" mentioned was Brett Schultz, who had taken twenty wickets in the Sri Lankan tour but a knee injury had forced him out of the series. In the preview to the test series, the media saw as a battle between the pace of South Africa and the spin duo of Warne and Tim May.\nTour matches.\nSouth Africa vs. The Prime Minister's XI.\nThe opening match of the tour for South Africa was against the Prime Minister's XI in Manuka Oval. The Prime Minister's XI took home the victory by four runs over the South Africans, who still had some fitness worries leading into the match. Hansie Cronje was the top scorer for South Africa with 60 runs. Despite a late flurry of runs, South Africa did not match the required run rate early on and late tail-end wickets by Australia secured the victory.\nSouth Africa vs. Victoria.\nThe South Africans' next tour match was a four-day game against Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Batting first, the South Africans were bowled out for 261 on the opening day with Brian McMillan the top scorer with 55, while Victoria bowler, Damien Fleming took six wickets. The following day, Victoria could not take command. The youngster Brad Hodge was top scorer with 80 as Victoria lost four wickets for a single run before declaring on 8/330 only half an hour before lunch on the third day. Also on the third day, an angry McMillian described the pitch as a \"beach\" after injuring his knee, which forced him out for the first two tests. Rubber mats had to put in place on the run-up areas. Bowling South Africa for 178, Victoria chased down the target of 110 with six wickets to spare. Darrin Ramshaw was top scorer for Victoria with 42.\nSouth Africa vs. Queensland.\nAfter playing four matches in the tri-nation series, South Africa went to Queensland to play in the final warm-up match before the first test. Batting first, South Africa scored 7/335 in their first innings. This included a 242 run partnership between Hansie Cronje and Darryl Cullinan after they were 3/38 when the partnership arrived; they broke the Australian record for the fourth-wicket partnership. In response, only Stuart Law and Ian Healy settled in with 56 and 41 respectively, with the Queenslanders being bowled out for 183 on the second day. Fanie de Villiers was the pick of the bowlers with 3/34 with all of his wickets being in the top order. Not forcing the follow on, South Africa scored 8/224 in the second innings with Andrew Hudson scoring 105 in what was his first respectable score of the tour from six innings. The match would end in a draw, though, but not before Trevor Barsby almost scored a century as he fell one run short after falling leg before wicket to de Villiers.\nSouth Africa vs. New South Wales Invitational XI.\nInitially, this match was not on the tour schedule, but after the 1994 eastern seaboard fires tore through New South Wales, a match was arranged between the South Africans and an invitational eleven that featured Allan Border. For South Africa this was a practice match before the tri-nation series final against Australia and after Daryll Cullinan scored 95 in South Africa's 5/247. Chasing down the target, after a 59 from Mark Waugh, the invitational team collapsed as they lost six wickets for 25 runs to give South Africa the win by 19 runs. In Richard Snell's second spell he took four wickets to extinguish the hosts team's chances of winning.\nTest series summary.\n1st Test.\nAs the first test between these two sides in Australia since the 1963–64 tour, the opening test of the series was a momentous occasion. Leading up to the test, Jonty Rhodes was declared fit and ready to go after being unable to face fast bowling for twelve days because of an injury to his hand sustained during the One Day International (ODI) played in Sydney. The opening two days of the test saw barely any action on the field with rain being a constant feature. After winning the toss, Australia got to 2/71 from the overs played during the first day with only Michael Slater and nightwatchman Shane Warne being the wickets to fall. In the case of Warne's wicket, it was Fanie de Villiers first wicket in test cricket as he and Gary Kirsten debuted for the South Africans.\nThe second day saw no play for the first time in Melbourne since the 1970–71 match against England when that whole test was abandoned. Estimates of revenue from the first two days was around $600,000 because of the loss of ten of the twelve hours of scheduled play. The following day saw another 128 minutes being played for only 69 runs before rain affected the rest of the day. The Australian Cricket Board had discussions about the test being turned into an ODI (One Day International). After the final two days, the match ended in a draw. During the match, Mark Taylor scored his 12th century becoming the second player after Martin Crowe to score centuries against seven different test nations. He would go on to score 170 as he and Mark Waugh (84) led Australia to declare on 7/342. For South Africa, Craig Matthews was the pick of the bowlers with 3/68. After ending the day on 1/59, South Africa finished the test on 3/258 with Cronje scoring 71 and Kepler Wessels, who had to be on pain-killing tablets the previous day, ended on 63 not out as the match finished in a draw.\n2nd Test.\nThe series' second test match saw changes only to the Australian side as they went with the same twelve players but with McGrath replacing Reiffel in the lineup. South Africa went with the same eleven from the first test. This was despite Brian McMillian testing his knee in the nets hoping for a call up to the team as he was picked as the 12th man. Wessels got through training and kept his spot on the team. On the opening day, South Africa won the toss and elected to bat. Initially, the decision was a good one, with the South Africans being 1/91 with Kirsten (67) and Cronje (41) setting a 90-run partnership. But with the crowd of 32,681 urging him on, Warne took 7/22 in a 78-ball spell as South Africa collapsed to be all out for 169. After surviving the first day on 1/20, Australia slow-marched their way towards South Africa's score with Slater (92) being in a 104-run partnership with captain Allan Border (49) that took four hours. During this time, Slater got hit on his right hand three times from the small plates of grass on the Randwick End with Border also getting hit in the eye as he attempted to sweep over Symcox' bowling. In an interview that day, Slater said, \"The wicket is deteriorating quite quickly, and quite powdery.\" \"The Age\" described the pitch as more disintegrated than a fourth-day Shield strip. South Africa wasn't without trouble with Wessels having to be on the field for a short while due to a dive from second slip as it split the webbing inside the hand.\nAustralia batted for close to three hours on the third day before being bowled out for 292. This was helped by Damien Martyn, who delivered with his square cuts and pull shots for his 59. South Africa, though, had six chances going down during the innings which added to the four from the previous test. In bowling, de Villiers was the pick of the bowlers as he took 4/80 from 36 overs while Allan Donald also took four wickets. South Africa's she second innings saw some resistance with Kirsten and Cronje keeping Shane Warne away from wicket-taking opportunities. After Kirsten was bowled by Craig McDermott, Wessels (18) was brought up the order to bat at four. Despite the injury to his hand, which would later rule him out of the rest of the series, he defended his wicket for 41 minutes, getting South Africa to 2/94 by day's end. After an early collapse of 3/9 on the fourth day, Jonty Rhodes (76*) steadied the ship as he lasted three and a quarter hours, wearing down Warne and counter-attacking McDermott. His innings featured seven boundaries, which included a six over the square leg fence. Small contributions from Dave Richardson (24) and Allan Donald (10) got the score to 239, which set Australia a target of 117. Warne again being the pick of bowlers with 5/72 as his bowling performance of 12/128 had the best second performance by a bowler at the SCG (Sydney Cricket Ground).\nChasing 117 for victory, Australia got off to 1/51 before de Villiers took three wickets from five balls as he got David Boon (24), Tim May (0) and Taylor (27) to put Australia at 4/63 at the end of the day. Only Mark Waugh avoided giving de Villiers his hat-trick when he clipped the ball to mid-wicket for a three. The first over of the final day saw Border's wicket fall for seven off Donald to put Australia at 5/63. After the wickets from Warne, Healy and Waugh fell, Australia was now 8/75 with two wickets left. McDermott played his natural game on his 29*, while at the other end Damien Martyn (6) held firm at his crease. For 106 minutes he kept his wicket alive, bringing the target to only seven runs needed before driving a catch in the covers. The last wicket fell only eight balls later to give South Africa the win by five runs and their first test win at the SCG.\n3rd Test.\nHeading into the test, the teams played in tri-series finals, which Australia won 2–1. On the day of the third final, the Australian touring squad confirmed their spot in the Austral-Asia Cup that was to be played after the South African tour. After winning the toss and electing to bat, Australian players Taylor, Slater and Boon all recorded half-centuries before getting out trying to raise the tempo of their innings. At the end of the day, Australia ended at 4/240 with Donald being the only multi-wicket taker with two wickets. After ending the first day on 32, Steve Waugh played with impressive confidence on his way to 164 runs as he and Allan Border broke the Australian record for the fifth wicket partnership against South Africa with 208. During that partnership though, Border became the first cricket player to get to 11,000 tests runs on his way to 84 as he got Australia to declare at 7/469. In response, South Africa only just avoided the follow on as they scored 273 for their first innings. Andrew Hudson was the South African's top scorer with 90 as he got them to 2/173 with Gary Kirsten (43) and Peter Kirsten (79) contributing. This was undone, though, by an inspirational spell from Steve Waugh who took four wickets in his spell. This was due to not taking the new ball at the end of the 80th over with Border keeping Waugh on.\nNot forcing the follow on, the Australians struggled in the second innings with only Taylor (38) and Boon (38) resisting the South Africans as they limped to 6/124 before Border declared with 25 minutes after the third session of Day 4. The final hour of the fourth day saw Warne pick up two wickets for only two runs as the South Africans chasing 320 to win the series ended the day on 3/18 as Cronje and Kirsten both fell for single figures. Fanie de Villiers (30) and Kirsten (42) held the Australians out with a three-hour partnership for 82 runs as their opponents made 12 changes of seven different bowlers before de Villiers fell from a catch from Paul Reiffel at mid-off. That wicket would see a collapse as the South Africans lost their remaining seven wickets for only 29 runs to be bowled out for 129 and give Australia the win by 191 runs. During this collapse, Warne who got his 100th test wicket, while Healy claimed his 200th victim in test cricket with a splendid diving catch of McDermott.\nStatistics.\nAfter the three tests were played, Australian batsman, Mark Taylor ended the series with the most runs with 304 runs from five innings which included his 170 in the drawn test match at Melbourne. He finished ahead of fellow team-mate, Michael Slater (185 runs) and South African batsman Gary Kirsten (175 runs) who rounded out the top three. In the bowling area, Australian spinner, Shane Warne ended up as the leading wicket taker of the series with 18 wickets which included a 7/56 from the first innings in the Sydney test match. He finished ahead of fellow team-mate, Craig McDermott with South African pace bowler, Allan Donald rounding out the top three."

        "title": "George Derby (baseball)",
        "text": "George Henry Derby (July 15, 1857 – July 15, 1925), nicknamed \"Jonah\", was a professional baseball player from 1877 to 1883. He played three seasons in Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher for the Detroit Wolverines in 1881 and 1882 and for the Buffalo Bisons in 1883.\nDerby won 29 games and led the National League in both strikeouts and shutouts as a 24-year-old rookie in 1881. However, after pitching 55 complete games and almost 500 innings in 1881, Derby developed shoulder problems that reduced the velocity of his pitches. His career was cut short, and he played in his final major league game in July 1883 at age 25.\nEarly years.\nDerby was born in Webster, Massachusetts, in 1857. He began his professional baseball career at age 19 in 1877 with the Hornellsville, New York, team in the League Alliance. He next played for the Syracuse Stars of the International Association in 1878 and the Washington team of the National Association in 1879 and 1880. In 1880, he compiled a 10–7 record and an 0.57 earned run average (ERA) in 158 innings for Washington.\nMajor League Baseball.\nDetroit Wolverines.\n1881 season.\nDerby signed with the newly formed Detroit Wolverines for the 1881 season. He was described as \"a compactly built, blonde haired, blue-eyed, pleasant-voiced gentleman who was to do all the pitching, and right well did he do his work.\" During his rookie season, Derby led the National League in both strikeouts (212) and shutouts (9). He also established a franchise record for the Detroit Wolverines that was never broken with innings pitched in 1881; Derby started 55 games for Detroit, all complete games, and also had one relief appearance. The \"Detroit Free Press\" described Derby's rise to stardom in the first part of the 1881 season:\"His speed was moderate, but he was the master of all the crooks and curves that can be imparted to the aerial projectiles. In obedience to his will, the ball twisted out or in, up or down. He held batsmen at his mercy to a degree equalled by no other pitcher. He was the wizard of the pitcher's box, and within a month George H. Derby had risen from obscurity to fame in base ball circles.\"\nHe finished the 1881 season with a 29–26 record, a 2.20 earned run average (ERA), and an Adjusted ERA+ of 131. However, late in the 1881 season, Derby's dominance waned, and opposing teams began hitting him more freely. When the Detroit team included him on its reserve list at the end of the 1881 season, some questioned the decision. The \"Detroit Free Press\" noted that there were suspicions that Derby's decline had been intentional:\"For three months [Derby and Bennett] formed the most effective battery in the League, playing game after game without error. Wild pitches, wild throws, and passed balls were almost unknown to them. Then they began to make errors . . . In plain words, they both, for some incomprehensible reason, began playing badly . . . Suspicion was common, and it sometimes found a voice, that Detroit's famous battery were 'playing for a release.'\"\nIt was revealed the next year that Derby had begun experiencing shoulder problems late in the 1881 season. Derby complained that he had been unable to \"give force to the ball\" and therefore pitched fewer games in August and September 1881.\n1882 season.\nIn 1882, Derby proved fairly effective in the beginning of the season, but his velocity was off. In 1881, Derby had relied on the combination of speed and deceptive delivery. Without the speed, \"batters had got accustomed to slow curve pitching, [and] he was hit freely and heavily.\" Derby started 39 games and pitched 362 innings in 1882 (down from 55 and 494 the year before) and compiled a 17–20 record. His ERA jumped by more than a point from 2.20 in 1881 to 3.26 in 1882.\nOn September 14, 1882, the Detroit team suspended Derby for playing poorly. The \"Detroit Free Press\" wrote that Derby's star had sunk \"beneath the base ball horizon\" but questioned the fairness of a suspension: \"If he [played poorly] intentionally, the sentence is just; if not, it is severe in the extreme. . . . He was wild in his delivery and had so little speed that the batters experienced little difficulty in hitting balls that came across the plate.\"\nBuffalo Bisons.\nIn October 1882, the Buffalo Bisons announced that Derby would join their team in 1883. Derby's performance in 1883 at Buffalo continued the slide. He started only 13 games for Buffalo and compiled a 2–10 record with a 5.85 ERA. He appeared in his final major league game on July 3, 1883, at age 25.\nCareer statistics.\nOver his three major league seasons, Derby compiled a 48–56 record in 110 appearances, with a 3.01 ERA and 428 strikeouts.\nLater years.\nDerby died in Philadelphia at the age of 67. He was buried at Wellsboro Cemetery in Wellsboro, Pennsylvania."

        "text": "Robert Herber Parsons (June 29, 1950 – July 8, 2022) was an American football punter and tight end who played twelve seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played for the Chicago Bears from 1972 to 1983 and later played with the Birmingham Stallions of the United States Football League (USFL).\nHe holds the NFL record for most punts in a season with 114, set in 1981, but is tied with Chad Stanley.\nEarly life.\nParsons was born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, on June 29, 1950. He attended Pen Argyl Area High School in nearby Pen Argyl. He then studied at Pennsylvania State University.\nCollege career.\nParsons played for the Penn State Nittany Lions, which was coached by Joe Paterno at the time. He saw his first game action during the 1969 season as the team's third string quarterback. Playing behind starter Chuck Burkhart and Mike Cooper, Parsons saw limited action, appearing in a couple of games, complete five of twelve passes and one interception. Penn State finished second in the AP poll that year. With Burkhart graduated, Parsons moved up to second string behind Cooper on a stacked squad that featured future NFL stars Franco Harris and Lydell Mitchell in the backfield. With the veteran Burkhart gone, and only Cooper and Parsons at the helm, Penn State slipped to 7–3 in 1970. The following season, Paterno made a radical change to the quarterback position. He named John Hufnagel as the starter and made Parsons a tight end. In his first and only college season as a receiver, Parsons responded by catching 30 passes for 489 yards and 5 touchdown receptions. Penn State took on Texas at the conclusion of the season in the Cotton Bowl. The Nittany Lions routed the Longhorns, 30–6, A key 19 yard pass from Hufnagel to Parsons helped set up a Penn state score.\nProfessional career.\nParsons was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the fifth round (117th overall selection) of the 1972 NFL Draft. He made the team as a rookie, playing behind starter Earl Thomas. The Bears finished 4–9–1 under head coach Abe Gibron, but Parsons scored a touchdown during rookie season, in his first game as a pro. Not long after Atlanta Falcons defensive end John Zook returned a fumble for a score, Bears quarterback Bobby Douglas found Parsons for a game tying six yard touchdown pass. That would be as close as the Bears would get, as the Falcons routed Chicago 37–21. Parsons remained a back-up tight end the following season, catching a few passes throughout the season. The Bears fell to 3–11 in 1973 under Gibron. Parsons became a starter for the first time in his pro career the following year, changing positions from tight end to punter in order to replace Bobby Joe Green. In his first season as a punter, Parsons punted 90 times for a 37.9 yard average with one punt blocked. However, the Bears once again finished the season with double digit losses.\nThe 1975 season saw the arrival of new head coach Jack Pardee and rookie running back Walter Payton. Parsons was even doing double duty. He was the team's punter as well as the starting tight end. That season Parsons caught 13 passes for 184 yards, and a touchdown, his first since the first game of his rookie season. Parsons' second career touchdown came from quarterback Gary Huff in the Bears 27–14 win over the rival Green Bay Packers. In 1976, Parsons was back to being the team's punter, though he did complete two passes during the season. One was a 23-yard pass against the Detroit Lions week one, and the second one a 25-yard pass week eight against the Minnesota Vikings. Both games were Bears victories. In 1977, the Bears finally had a winning season, going 9–5, and making the playoffs. However, they lost to the Dallas Cowboys 37–7, with Parsons punting six times that game as the Bears offense struggled to get on track.\nAfter the conclusion of the 1977 season, Pardee left to coach the Washington Redskins and Neill Armstrong succeeded him as the Bears head coach. While the Bears slipped to 7–9, Parsons had himself as the Bears punter. He would remain so until 1983, when Mike Ditka cut Parsons after week 14 and replaced him with ex-Packers punter Ray Stachowicz. Ditka had become enraged when he learned that Parsons had been talking to the owners of the Chicago Blitz of the USFL about signing on as the team's punter of the possibility of a role as a special teams coach. Ditka, already reeling from quarterback Vince Evans pending departure to the upstart spring league, and that the league had been talking to other members of the Bears, cut Parsons, citing he only wanted players that would be loyal to the Bears.\nAfter departing the Bears, Parsons signed with the Birmingham Stallions of the USFL. The team managed to sign quarterback Cliff Stoudt away from the Pittsburgh Steelers, and running back Joe Cribbs from the Buffalo Bills. In a 1985 playoff game against the Houston Gamblers, led by quarterback Jim Kelly, the Stallions eliminated Houston, thanks in part to Parsons punt that pinned Houston on their own one yard line. During his time the Stallions, Parsons served mainly as the team's punter. In 1984, he punted 42 times for 1,625 yards. In 1985, he punted 67 times for 2,626 yards. After the 1985 season, with the USFL's future in doubt due to a lawsuit against the NFL, Parsons retired from pro football.\nDuring the 1975, 1981 and 1982 seasons, Parsons led the NFL in punting attempts, while leading the NFL in punt yards in both 1982 and 1983. With 34,180 career punting yards, he ranks 45th all-time in NFL history, and 53rd all-time with most punts blocked with five.\nPersonal life.\nParsons was married to Denise J. ( Feliccia) until his death. Together, they had three children. After retiring from football, he worked as a real estate appraiser. He resided in Lake Zurich, Illinois, during his later years.\nParsons died on July 8, 2022, at the age of 72."

        "text": "Andrew Gee (born 23 April 1970) is an Australian rugby league administrator and former football operations manager at the Brisbane Broncos of the NRL. Also a former player with the club, he was a Queensland State of Origin representative , and at the time of his retirement, held the Broncos' club record for most appearances of any forward.\nPlaying career.\nWhile attending Beaudesert High School, Gee played for the Australian Schoolboys team in 1986. He transferred from Beaudesert, Queensland to play in the NSWRL Premiership for the Brisbane Broncos in 1989, the club's second season. He started his representative career for Queensland the following year, selected as a reserve in games 2 and 3 of the 1990 State of Origin series.\nGee was rewarded after his strong display in the 1991 State of Origin series with selection for the 1991 Kangaroo tour of Papua New Guinea, making just one non-Test match appearance before being injured. He also met a similar fate the following season, played just seven matches and was left out of the starting line up that defeated St George Dragons 28–8 in the 1992 NSWRL Grand Final. In the weeks following the grand final Gee traveled with the Broncos to England, where he played as a in the 1992 World Club Challenge against British champions Wigan, helping Brisbane become the first Australian club to win the World Club Challenge in Britain. Gee was a reserve when the club won the second of its two consecutive premierships in 1993. He overcame a lengthy suspension at the beginning of the 1994 season to take his place in the side that lost the 1994 World Club Challenge to Wigan, 20–14, at ANZ Stadium in June in front of a WCC record attendance of 54,220 fans.\nGee toiled with the Broncos through the club's domination of the 1997 Super League season and took his place in the champion Brisbane team that won the 1998 NRL grand final. In 1998 he also won the club's player of the year award. He left the club at the end of 1999 to join Warrington but later returned to the Broncos, along with former captain Allan Langer, for the 2002 season. Sometimes criticized for lack of discipline resulting in needless penalties which potentially cost his team victories, Gee finished his playing career in 2003. That year he also made the State of Origin team, some 13 years after his first representative match. He was the first player to play 250+ games for the Broncos. Early in the 2007 season at the Broncos' 20-year anniversary celebration, the club announced a list of the 20 best players to play for them to date which included Gee. In 2009 Gee was inducted into the Broncos official Hall of Fame.\nAlthough Gee was well revered as a sturdy, defensive player. He kicked twice during his first grade rugby league career, with one kick resulting in a 40/20 and the other forcing a dropout.\nCoaching and administration career.\nGee continued to serve at the Broncos assisting the coaching staff. In 2010 he was appointed the club's general manager of football operations."

        "text": "The Northern Premier Cricket League is a cricket league in the North West of England and was designated as an ECB Premier League in 2000. Prior to that date it was known as the Northern Cricket League.\nBecause the Northern Premier Cricket League had no formal feeder league and no automatic relegation and promotion, the ECB suggested on several occasions that its ECB Premier League status might be withdrawn. As from 2017, the Palace Shield became the Northern Premier League's feeder league and promotion and relegation between the two leagues took place for the first time at the end of the 2017 season.\nHistory.\nThe Northern Cricket League was founded on 10 November 1951, in controversial circumstances.\nSeveral of the clubs in the west of the area covered by the Ribblesdale League had been unhappy for some time about the format of that League. The League had a membership of 18 clubs which meant that only 5 opponents in the League were played against twice per season whilst the remainder were played against once. This group of clubs met secretly on 7 October 1951 and produced a handwritten document which stated:\n\"The following Ribblesdale League clubs:- Blackpool, Chorley, Darwen, Fleetwood, Lancaster, Leyland, Morecambe, St Annes being duly authorised by their respective Committees are resolved from this meeting to request the Ribblesdale League to form a West Section, comprising the above named clubs together with Leyland Motors, Furness and Kendal. Failing agreement on the part of the Ribblesdale League the above eight clubs pledge themselves to resign forthwith from the Ribblesdale League and to create a new league, which would include an invitation to Leyland Motors, Furness, Kendal and Preston.\nAt the AGM of the Ribblesdale League, held in Whalley on 10 November 1951, the motion was proposed to form West and East sections with the West section comprising Blackpool, Chorley, Darwen, Fleetwood, Lancaster, Leyland, Morecambe, and St Annes, plus two new clubs Furness and Kendal (both from the North Lancashire Cricket League) along with Leyland Motors if they wished to play in the West section. After discussion, the vote was 9–9 and was defeated on the casting vote of the President who had earlier expressed distaste at the way the western clubs had acted.\nThe eight clubs duly resigned from the Ribblesdale League, as did Leyland Motors, and representatives of these clubs along with those of Furness and Kendal then met at the Swan Hotel in Whalley where the Northern Cricket League was formed. Preston Cricket Club were invited to join the new league as the twelfth team. The invitation was accepted but they remained in the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition for one further year before participating in the Northern Cricket League's second season in 1953.\nFurness left the league after the 1958 season to be replaced by Netherfield, but there were to be no further changes to the membership until Barrow joined the league in 2004. More recent changes in the membership can be seen below. Leyland merged with lower level club BTR in 2000 and adopted the name Leyland and Farington, while Leyland Motors were known as Leyland DAF between 1991 and 2000. Founder members Darwen left the league after the 2016 season. In 2017 promotion and relegation was agreed between the Northern League and Palace Shield and at the end of the season Garstang and Fulwood &amp; Broughton replaced Lancaster and Kendal. For the 2023 season, Fleetwood re-joined the Northern League as Palace Shield champions, alongside Palace Shield runners-up and Northern League newcomers Eccleston with Lancaster and Vernon Carus going in the opposition direction and both returning to the Palace Shield.\nWinners.\nsource."

        "text": "Out of the Park Baseball (abbreviated as OOTP) is a text-based baseball simulation for career, historical, and fictional play.\nStarting with \"OOTP 16\", the game has licenses for Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball.\nHistory.\nThe first version was released in May 1999 with the help of sportswriter Sean Lahman, who sold the game through his website. This initial version received attention from several online gaming sites. The breakthrough release came in 2001 with \"OOTP 3\".\nIn 2002, lead developer Markus Heinsohn joined with other independent developers to form .400 Software Studios to publish \"OOTP 5\". Heinsohn and a few others split from .400 Software Studios in mid-2003 to continue work on the \"OOTP\" series as well as \"Inside the Park Baseball\".\nIn 2005 \"OOTP\" was purchased by Sports Interactive, makers of \"Football Manager\" and \"NHL Eastside Hockey Manager\", though Heinsohn remained the game's primary creative force. \"Out of the Park Baseball 2006\" was released on May 31, 2006. Sporting a rewritten codebase and several new features, it was met with mixed critical reaction.\n\"Out of the Park Baseball 2007\" the eighth iteration of the game, was released on March 23, 2007, to much better reviews than its predecessor. Out of the Park Baseball 2007 was Metacritic's second highest rated game on the PC platform with a score of 96 out of 100, scoring higher than \"The Orange Box\", and second to \"Half-Life 2\". Metacritic removed the game from the \"Best PC Video Games of All Time\" list in 2015 after being there almost nine years, due to a new review threshold limit.\nOn September 20, 2007, Sports Interactive announced the amicable severance of relations with Out of the Park Developments and the \"OOTP\" franchise.\nIn December 2007 Out of the Park Developments released \"Out of the Park Baseball 8\", a simple update of \"OOTP 2007\" that adjusted for the split from SI and added a few new features.\nSince \"OOTP 2006\" the user interface utilizes the P.I.S.D. Ltd platform libraries for cross-platform portability.\nOOTP Developments released OOTP X (10) on June 5, 2009. OOTP 11 was released to the masses on April 14, 2010.\nIn October 2010 OOTP announced that development had started on \"iOOTP\", a version of the game for iPhone and iPod touch. iOOTP became available at the App Store on May 5, 2011.\nOn May 13, 2011, it was announced that \"OOTP 12\" was expected to be released to the general public on June 22, 2011, and on June 20 for those who pre-ordered the game. \"OOTP 12\" was shipped to the general public on June 22, 2011, and on June 20 for those who pre-ordered the game, as expected.\nOn April 5, 2012 \"iOOTP Baseball 2012 Edition\" was released to Apple's iOS App Store. New features in iOOTP 2012 included 2012 major league rosters, detailed player histories, a revamped user interface, a new fictional setup, the ability to use pitch-by-pitch mode, the ability to use the DH in any league, and more. The iPad HD version, which takes advantage of the iPad's larger display, was included free, as in the 2011 version.\nOn April 9, 2012 \"OOTP 13\" was released to the general public after an April 6 release to those who pre-ordered the game. New features in \"OOTP 13\" included: 2012 major league rosters; a real-time simulation mode that lets players watch games play out in real-time (or at a faster speed); interactive storylines that allow gamers to make decisions when situations happen (i.e., a star player becomes difficult—player can release him, trade him, or ignore the problem; each choice impacts fan attitudes, player morale, etc.); a revamped pitching model that more closely mirrors real life, where most drafted pitchers are starters and later become relievers, rather than being drafted as relievers; and random historical debut, which allows real players to show up at any point in history (perhaps Ruth shows up today and Koufax is drafted in the 1930s).\nIn addition, \"OOTP 13\" offered a revamped user interface, more custom playoff options, Associations that can combine multiple leagues and share free agents, rules, and more, core gameplay engine and AI improvements, and more.\nOn April 4, 2013 \"iOOTP Baseball 2013\" was released to Apple's iOS App Store. New features in \"iOOTP 2013\" included 2013 major league rosters, achievements, a redesigned interface, new trading AI, a new player development system, more realistic player creation, historical career play with real rookies imported each season, and more.

It was released on April 18, 2014, on the OOTP Developments web site. New features in \"OOTP 15\" included: Opening Day 2014 rosters for all major and minor league teams; support for 3D stadiums and 3D in-game ball flight; support for 7 real international leagues with real teams and players in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and other countries; a new optional ratings system; a revamped interface; historical league improvements; and more.\n\"iOOTP Baseball 2014\" was released on the iOS App Store on April 17, 2014. New features included: Opening Day 2014 rosters; the ability to edit players; a redesigned interface; iPhone 5 and full Retina Display support; and more.\nOn January 23, 2015 \"Out of the Park Baseball 16\" was announced for PC, Mac and Linux. Featuring a new license with Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball, along with reworked finances, a new managers and coaches system, new independent leagues, and more, it was expected to be released in March of that year. \"OOTP 16\" was released on March 23, 2015.\nOn the same day, OOTP Developments announced that \"iOOTP Baseball\" would now be known as \"MLB Manager\", and the 2015 version would also be released in March for iOS and Android, with the MLB license applying to that game too. New features were due to be announced in February. \"MLB Manager 2015\" was released on March 26, 2015.\n\"Out of the Park Baseball 17\" was released on March 22, 2016, on PC, Mac, and Linux. In addition to the MLB license added the previous season, \"OOTP 17\" also features the MLBPA license. A host of new features were added, including the ability to play Historical Exhibitions against any teams ever in the \"era\" of the user's choosing. A \"16 in '16\" tournament was set up by the development team based upon ranking all-time teams by famous baseball writers such as Tim Kurkjian, Neil Paine, Mark Simon, Brian Kenny, Ken Hirdt, C.J. Nitkowski, and others. The 1927 Yankees were the tournament champions. \"Out of the Park Baseball 17\" wound up tied with \"The Witcher 3\" as the highest-rated PC game on Metacritic for 2016, with a rating of 92.\nOn March 20, 2020, Out of the Park Developments released \"OOTP Baseball 21\".\nProminent OOTP gamers.\nSome renowned sports figures have played the game, including writer and statistician Bill James, sports journalist Roy Firestone, and retired MLB pitcher Curt Schilling. Other ex-MLB fans of the game include Jeff Montgomery, Don Stanhouse, John D'Acquisto, and Lary Sorensen, who all participated in the 2012 Seamheads Laundry League, an online OOTP league that also featured ESPN's Eric Karabell and Jerry Crasnick, among other journalists, bloggers, podcasters, etc.\nOn March 24, 2012, Curt Schilling was given an early look at \"OOTP 13\" and tweeted: \"WOW! Early first look at #ootp13 seems like they really upped the bar! New UI is outstanding so far!\"\nPitcher Pat Neshek is also a fan, commenting in a tweet on August 12, 2012: \"Spent the day off yesterday playing OOTP13 Baseball for most of the day. Talk about addicting.\"\nIn addition, professional wrestler Steve Corino is a fan of the game. On November 23, 2012, he tweeted: \"Totally addicted to this 'Out Of The Park Baseball 13' game. Anyone play it out there?\"\nBoston Red Sox principal owner John W. Henry is an \"OOTP\" fan as well, commenting: \"Last year, I explored \"OOTP 15\" and was amazed by the breadth and depth of it.\"\nGameplay.\n\"OOTP\" presents a minimal graphic depiction of a baseball diamond with text indicating positions and on-field action. Scrolling text allows one to follow the game as it unfolds. The game offers HTML reporting ample enough to engage baseball fans. Third-party developers have contributed utility programs that assist gamers in creating leagues, players, logos, and other game enhancements.\nOther versions.\nIn 2001, a retail (physical media) version of \"OOTP3\" called \"Season Ticket Baseball\" was released. Released a year later was its sequel, a retail version of \"OOTP4\" titled \"Season Ticket Baseball 2003\".\nIn 2004, Heinsohn released \"Inside the Park Baseball\", which tracked the progression of an individual baseball player. Gamers followed a player's career from before the draft, through the minor leagues, until possibly called up to the Major Leagues. \"Inside the Park Baseball\" was designed to work alongside \"OOTP 5\", whereby one might insert a player into an \"OOTP 5\" season.\nReception.\n\"Out of the Park Baseball 6\" was a runner-up for \"Computer Games Magazine\"s 2004 \"Best Independent Game\" award, but lost to \"Gish\".\nThe editors of \"Computer Games Magazine\" presented \"Out of the Park Baseball 2006\" with their 2006 \"Best Sports Game\" award.\nDuring the 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated \"Out of the Park 5\" for \"Computer Sports Game of the Year\", which was ultimately awarded to \"Madden NFL 2004\"."

He previously served as an Senior Offensive assistant coach for the New York Jets, New Orleans Saints, San Francisco 49ers and Las Vegas Raiders. He also served as an assistant coach at USC.\nPlaying career.\nMorton played college football at Western Michigan, where he was a wide receiver. He played wide receiver professionally for the Canadian Football League Toronto Argonauts and on the practice squads of the Oakland Raiders and Green Bay Packers.\nCoaching career.\nAfter ending his playing career in 1997, Morton began working for the National Football League's Oakland Raiders, initially in the personnel department for one season. In 1998, he took a coaching position in the organization, originally as an offensive assistant working with wide receivers, and eventually was promoted to senior offensive assistant on a team that made it to Super Bowl XXXVII under head coach Bill Callahan. After another year at the position, he was elevated to Tight Ends Coach for the 2004 season under new Raiders head coach Norv Turner.\nIn 2005, he joined Jim Harbaugh's staff at the University of San Diego, a D-IAA college program, where he coached the passing game and wide receivers for a squad that went 11-1-0 and won the Pioneer Football League Championship. The following season, he took a position as an offensive assistant with the New Orleans Saints under head coach Sean Payton, who advanced to the 2006 NFC Championship game.\nMorton joined USC in 2007, taking up a similar position to the one he held at San Diego. When offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian accepted a head coaching position with Washington, Morton was interviewed by head coach Pete Carroll as a candidate for the position. As expected, Morton eventually got the job.\nIn 2017, he was hired by the New York Jets as an offensive coordinator. On January 17, 2018, Morton was subsequently fired.\nIn February 2019, Morton returned to Oakland as the Senior Offensive Assistant under Jon Gruden.

        "title": "Swedish Golf Tour",
        "text": "The Swedish Golf Tour, currently titled as the Cutter &amp; Buck Tour for sponsorship reasons, is a developmental professional golf which was formerly operated by Svenska Golftourerna AB, as well as being owned equally by the Swedish Golf Federation and the PGA of Sweden. Since 2018 it has been operated by the Swedish Golf Federation.\nThe tour is designed to help Swedish golfers to reach the standard of play needed to qualify for the European Tour or the Challenge Tour.\nThe events on the SGT are included in the Nordic Golf League, which is one of four European Tour-recognised third-tier tours, and is run in collaboration by the national golf associations of Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. The four third-level tours carry Official World Golf Ranking points.\nEach year, usually in October, a 2-stage qualifying school tournament is held, which gives players an opportunity to qualify for the SGT.\nThe developing tour to the SGT is the Future Series, with a minimum prize fund of SKr 50,000 per tournament 2020. The Future Series Ranking, gives players the opportunity to qualify for the SGT.\nThe Swedish Golf Tour for women was established in 1986 and is run by the same organization.\nHistory.\nThe history of the men's Swedish Golf Tour is closely linked to the history of professional golf in Sweden. Until the late 1960s, the main, and usually only, professional tournament in Sweden was the Dunlop Cup, played 1932–1968. From 1958, the Penfold Cup was added as a yearly professional tournament in Sweden. In 1969, a conflict between the Swedish Golf Federation and the PGA of Sweden, resulted in that no professional tournaments were sanctioned by the federation to take place in the country.\nStarting in 1970, the Dunlop Cup was transformed to the official Swedish PGA Championship, which became the most important tournament on a small but soon growing professional circuit in Sweden. At this time, the majority of the club professionals in Sweden were British and none of the Swedish PGA members were tournament professionals. A point system at the few existing tournaments decided the yearly selection of the two best professionals, who were Swedish citizens, to represent Sweden at the World Cup, usually played far away in the world and long after the Swedish golf season was concluded. Understandably, the Swedish teams usually had difficulties to be competitive.\nThe first Swedish tournament professionals appeared in the early 1970s, with Jan Rosell as the very first in 1971, soon followed by Bengt Malmqvist and Gunnar Mueller. From 1977, only tournament professionals have represented Sweden in the World Cup.\nIn 1970, the first international world class 72-hole golf tournament in Sweden took place, the invitational tournament Volvo Open, with Jack Nicklaus and Lanny Wadkins in the field, at Delsjö Golf Club and Royal Drottningholm Golf Club.\nIn 1972, Flygt Open at Viksjö Golf Club and in 1973, Eskilstuna Open was added to the domestic pro circuit schedule.\nIn July 1973, the first European Tour tournament held in Sweden, the Scandinavian Enterprise Open, took place at Royal Drottningholm Golf Club outside Stockholm. Swedish elite players, amateurs as well as professionals, had the opportunity to try to qualify and a few of them were invited directly to the main tournament. Abdel Halim, Egypt, and John Cockin, England, both working as club professionals in Sweden for many years, shared 24th and 36th place respectively. Cockin shared his place with world stars Kel Nagle and Doug Sanders.\nIn 1978, Gunnar Mueller became the first Swedish born professional to qualify for the last round at the Scandinavian Enterprise Open. Six Swedish amateurs had achieved that before him.\nAt the annual meeting of the Swedish Golf Federation in March 1983, \"open golf\" was introduced, which meant that, from next year both amateurs and professionals were allowed to enter all domestic competitions, the PGA Championship and international amateur tournaments excluded (amateurs later allowed at the PGA Championship). Non-PGA members with a licence, as well as PGA members, were allowed to receive prize money. The new and internationally unique rules, made it possible to transform the traditionally most important amateur tournaments in the country to professional tournaments, attractive to sponsors and made it possible for many top amateurs to turn professional.\nThe Swedish Golf Tour, SGT, was founded in November 1983, to begin in May 1984, and was organized by the PGA of Sweden and the Swedish Golf Federation (SGF) together. Two tournament directors, one from each organization, were appointed to switch responsibility between them for the tournaments, Christer Lindberg from the PGA and Göran Henriks from the SGF. The main sponsor was Kullenberg Fastighets AB\nThe same year, when tournament professionals already had been dominating the Swedish PGA Championship and the other domestic professional tournaments for several years, a Swedish Club pro PGA Championship, limited to instructing professionals in Sweden and not included in the SGT, was established.\nThe first year, 1984, the SGT consisted of seven tournaments with a total prize amount of SKr 1.3 million and winners' share between SKr 25,000 and SKr 50,000 for each tournament. Except that, the European Tour tournament in Sweden, the 1984 Scandinavian Enterprise Open (SEO), with a prize fund of SKr 1.5 million, was included in the SGT.\nAs the best Swedish players were expected to mainly compete abroad, two Order of Merit standings were counted, one with total money won by SGT-members, with other main tours included, and one with only SGT tournaments counted. One of the purposes with two rankings was to select players to represent Sweden at the World Cup. The first Order of Merit (Total) was won by Anders Forsbrand and the first Order of Merit (SGT) was won by Mats Lanner, who won the final tournament Kullenberg Playoff at Björn Borg Sports Club, Lindö, Stockholm.\nThe year after, the tour grew to nine tournaments, of which one had a first prize of SKr 100,000. Beyond that, the 1985 SEO was included in the SGT. The 1985 Order of Merit (Total) was won by Ove Sellberg and the Order of Merit (SGT) was won by Per-Arne Brostedt.\nIn 1988, a company, Svenska Golftourerna AB, was founded, owned equally by the PGA of Sweden and the Swedish Golf Federation, to organize the two Swedish Golf Tours for men and women. Its first chairperson was Ola Öqvist.\nDuring 1987–1998, tournaments in other Nordic countries were included in the tour. From 1990 to 1994, all SGT tournaments were co-sanctioned by the Challenge Tour.\nIn 1994, a qualifying school tournament for the SGT was established, the first year held in the spring, with 312 players entering, and a second stage in June. The Q school was later moved to the autumn.\nUntil 1996, the SGT Order of Merit standings was decided by money won and since 1997 a point system has been in force. \nIn 1999, the Nordic Golf League (NGL) was established and came to include the SGT, as well as the national golf tour of Denmark and tournaments in Finland and Norway. \nAs the European Tour and the Challenge Tour have become stronger and richer, players have usually stayed to the tour on the highest level they have been qualified for, why the SGT Order of Merit (total) have lost its significance in favor of the NGL Order of Merit. The top five players on the NGL rankings list at the end of each season earn a place on the second tier Challenge Tour for the following year. Since July 2015, the NGL carry Official World Golf Ranking points. \nSince 2018 the Swedish Golf Federation drives the tour in its own organization. \nIn 2020, the men's Swedish Golf Tour initially included 16 scheduled tournaments, held in four countries, beginning in February and ending in October. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 schedule was subject to change. The Swedish Golf Federation and the PGA of Sweden decided on June 2, of a restart of the 2020 tour on July 2–4 with Katrineholm Open hosted by Robert Karlsson at Katrineholm Golf Club. Only two scheduled tournaments in Spain in February took place before a three months break. \nSponsorships.\nThe Swedish Golf Tour has been titled as the Scandinavian Golf Tour (1993–1995), the Telia Infomedia Golf Tour (1996–1997), the Telia Tour (1998–2008), the SAS Masters Tour (2008–2009), the Nordea Tour (2010–2016), the Swedish Golf Tour (2017–2019) and the MoreGolf Mastercard Tour (2020–2023).\nIn July 2023, it was announced that the tour had signed a title sponsorship agreement with Cutter &amp; Buck, being renamed as the Cutter &amp; Buck Tour from 2024.\nOrder of Merit winners.\nSources:"

The best four players from both federations were invited. The tournament was arranged by PenH Events, who managed to secure a three-year contract with Raymond van Barneveld, a BDO player at the time, taking part in the tournament. The host broadcaster was RTL5 in the Netherlands, who had also secured a three-year deal to broadcast the event. However, the tournament was not held in 2006 and by the time it was revived for 2007, SBS6 took over as Dutch broadcasters for the event.\nPrize Fund.\nTotal prize money for the event was €395,000 with the tournament winner securing €150,000 making it one of the richest prizes in darts. \nResults.\nAndy Fordham 1 - Phil Taylor 7"

        "title": "Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men's individual",
        "text": "The men's individual archery event at the 2004 Summer Olympics was part of the archery programme. Its final was held on 19 August at the Panathinaiko Stadium.\nRanking round.\nThe Korean archers, medal favorites in both men's and women's competition, ranked 1st (Im Dong-hyun), 4th (Park Kyung-mo), and 5th (Jang Yong-ho) in the men's individual ranking round. Im's score of 687 set a new world record for 72 arrows, breaking the previous one set in 1995 by fellow Korean Shim Young-sung. It is not recognized by the International Olympic Committee as an Olympic record, however, as the ranking round took place on 12 August, before the 2004 opening ceremony. The round was held at Dekelia Air Force Base.\nThe bracket setup (with 4th- and 5th-ranked archers facing off in the quarterfinals if undefeated and the winner of that match facing the 1st-ranked archer in the semifinals) meant that the Korean men could do no better than gold and bronze. Marco Galiazzo of Italy in 2nd and Magnus Petersson of Sweden in 3rd rounded out the top five, with Dmytro Hrachov in 6th with the same score as 5th-ranked Jang of Korea.\nThe three medalists of the 2000 Summer Olympics, Simon Fairweather, Vic Wunderle, and Wietse van Alten, all competed in 2004. None placed higher than 14th in the ranking round (van Alten) and only Wunderle made it to the quarterfinals.\nEvent summary.\nThe first round of elimination, held on 16 August, narrowed the field from 64 archers to 32 in a standard single-elimination bracket. The loser of each match received a final rank between 33 and 64, depending on his score in the round. Each archer fired six ends of three arrows, for a total possible score of 180. Oleksandr Serdyuk of Ukraine had the highest score in the round, with 164.\nThe first upset of the day belonged to 43rd-ranked Vic Wunderle of the United States, who defeated 22nd-ranked Majhi Sawaiyan of India. The United States were on the losing end of an even larger upset, though, when Butch Johnson lost to Ron van der Hoff of the Netherlands. The biggest upset occurred when 52nd-ranked Tashi Peljor of Bhutan defeated 13th-ranked Jocelyn de Grandis of France to become the lowest ranked archer to advance.\nAs in the round of 64, archers who advanced to the round of 32 fired six ends of three arrows in the second round of elimination. This round, on 18 August, narrowed the field from 32 to 16 archers, with winners advancing and losers receiving a final rank between 17 and 32 depending on their score in the round. Im Dong-hyun of Korea scored the highest in the round, missing the Olympic record by 1 point with a score of 171. 48th-ranked Satyadev Prasad of India was the lowest ranked archer to advance.\nVic Wunderle of the United States continued to have success in head-to-head competition, eliminating 11th-ranked Wang Cheng-pang of Chinese Taipei. In an astonishing match, 31st-ranked Laurence Godfrey, Great Britain eked out a victory over 2nd-ranked Magnus Petersson of Sweden. Two other top-ten-ranked archers fell when 27th-ranked Xue Haifeng of China defeated 6th-ranked Dmytro Hrachov of Ukraine and 25th-ranked Hasse Pavia Lind lost to Oleksandr Serdyuk. One of the Korean archers, Park Kyung-mo, nearly fell to Kazakhstani Stanislav Zabrodskiy when Zabrodskiy tied Park through the first 18 arrows and scored a 10 on the first tie-break. Park also scored a 10, and followed it up with a second 10 which Zabrodskiy could not match. A tie-break was also needed in the match between Viktor Ruban of Ukraine and Wang Cheng-pang of Chinese Taipei, which Ruban won 9–8.\nThe round of 16 was held on 19 August and followed the same 18-arrow format as the previous two rounds as it narrowed the field to eight quarterfinalists.\nThe first round of 12-arrow matches was the quarterfinals on 19 August. Winners advanced to the semifinals while losers received a final rank between 5 and 8 depending on score in the quarterfinals. The high score of the round was notched by Tim Cuddihy, with 112. In a see-saw battle, Marco Galiazzo took a lead over Vic Wunderle in the third end. In a tense final end, Wunderle closed the gap. Galiazzo, needing an 8 to tie on the last arrow, shot a 9 to advance and end Wunderle's run. In a surprise, both of the remaining Korean archers fell to Hiroshi Yamamoto and Tim Cuddihy in 1-point matches eliminating them from medal contention. Laurence Godfrey had the most decisive victory of the round, a still-close 2-point victory of Chen Szu Yuan.\nYamamoto and Cuddihy both tied the Olympic record for a 12-arrow match (set by Oh Kyo-moon in 1996) by tying their semifinal match at 115 on 19 August. In the tie-breaker, Yamamoto shot first and hit a 10. Cuddihy was unable to match this, shooting a 9 to drop out of gold medal contention.\nThe bronze medal match was held on 19 August as well. The winner received the bronze medal while the loser took fourth place. Cuddihy defeated Godfrey in a close match.\nThe gold medal match on 19 August pitted a first-time-Olympian Italian against a veteran Japanese archer, with the favored Koreans being conspicuously absent. The match consisted of 12 arrows, with the winner taking gold and the loser receiving a silver medal.\nWith a pair of 10s in the first end, Hiroshi Yamamoto took a quick lead of 1 point over Marco Galiazzo. In the second end, Galiazzo missed perfection by only 1 point, scoring 29 to Yamamoto's 27 to reverse the lead. He hit another pair of 10s in the third end, increasing his lead to 2 points going into the final end. Galiazzo maintained the lead through the final three arrows, winning Italy's first Olympic gold medal in archery. Yamamoto's silver was his second Olympic medal, joining the bronze medal that he won in 1984."

        "text": "The women's individual at the 2004 Summer Olympics as part of the archery programme were held at the Panathinaiko Stadium.\nThe heavily favored Korean women, who had taken the top three spots in the ranking round, won gold and silver medals as well as setting a new world record for a 72-arrow round. Park Sung-hyun and Lee Sung Jin defeated every opponent they faced until their final match against each other, which Park won for the gold medal. Alison Williamson of Great Britain, who was ranked only 21st after the ranking round, was able to win a number of upsets to make it to the semi-finals. After losing that match, she pulled off one more upset to finish with a bronze medal.\nRanking round.\nThe ranking round was held on 12 August at 09:00 at Dekelia Air Force Base. In the 72 arrow ranking round, the Korean women dominated the field, taking the top three spots and setting a world record with Park Sung-hyun's score of 682. The Chinese women also did well, placing 4th, 5th, and 11th. Yuan Shu Chi and Wu Hui Ju of Chinese Taipei finished 6th and 10th.\nEvent summary.\nIn the first round of elimination on 15 August, archers competed head-to-head. Each fired six ends of three arrows. Winners advanced to the round of 32, while losers received a final ranking between 33 and 64 based on their score in the round. Sayami Matsushita had the highest score of the round with 165.\nThe first big surprise of the round came when Tshering Chhoden of Bhutan, who had been ranked 54th, defeated 11th-ranked Lin Sang of China. This set Chhoden up for a round of 32 match with 43rd-ranked Reena Kumari of India, who had also won in an upset. One archer from the top ten, Natalia Valeeva of Italy, lost in the first round, to 56th-ranked Jasmin Figueroa of the Philippines.\nPerhaps the most exciting match of the day was between Małgorzata Sobieraj and Thin Thin Khaing, who tied with 151. Each archer shot a 9 on the first tie-breaking arrow and another 9 on the second. When the third tie-breaker resulted in an 8 for each archer, it was not possible to separate the two archers, even by measuring the distance to the centre of the target. It was only the second time in Olympic history that a fourth arrow was required to separate two archers, the first having been in Atlanta. Sobieraj's fourth arrow was better, giving her the win.\nHeld on 17 August, the second round of elimination, like the first, was a head-to-head competition in which each archer fired six ends of three arrows. Winners advanced to the round of 16, while losers received a final rank between 17 and 32 based on their scores in the round. Yun Mi-Jin of Korea scored 173 in the round, tying the Olympic record she set at the 2000 Summer Olympics.\n52nd-ranked Kirstin Jean Lewis pulled off her second upset of the tournament, defeating 20th-ranked Sumangala Sharma to become the lowest ranked archer to advance. Jennifer Nichols, ranked 19th, was the only other archer to win an upset, against 14th-ranked Tetyana Berezhna. 4th-ranked He Ying, however, nearly became the third upset victim and the only top ten archer of the day to fall when Melissa Jennison forced a tie-breaker that He won 9–8. Tshering Chhoden, who had won a major upset in the first round, nearly pulled off another, forcing Reena Kumari into a tie-breaker, which Kumari won.\nThe third round of elimination, on 18 August, was the final one that used the 18 arrow match. Winners advanced to the quarterfinals, while the losers received final rankings between 9 and 16 depending on their score in the round. Park Sung-hyun had the highest score of the round, as the three Koreans continued to win.\nThe Chinese women were handed another defeat at the hands of Alison Williamson of Great Britain, who at 21st was the only archer not from the top ten to qualify for the quarterfinals. The archers from Chinese Taipei both continued into the quarterfinals, as did Evangelia Psarra of Greece.\nWith 8 archers left, the quarterfinal matches on 18 August consisted of each archer firing four ends of three arrows. Winners advanced to the semifinals while the losers received final rankings between 5 and 8. The highest score of the round again was notched by Park Sung-hyun, with 111 points.\nAlison Williamson continued a great run, defeating 4th-ranked He Ying to advance to the semifinals. He missed the target with two arrows, but would have needed to score perfect 10s on each of those arrows to even tie Williamson and force a tie-breaker. Park Sung-hyun easily defeated Evangelia Psarra, scoring no less than 27 in any end of three arrows. In two matches between Korean archers and archers from Chinese Taipei, Yun Mi-Jin was the only Korean to lose so far in the women's competition, falling to Yuan Shu Chi. Lee Sung Jin, however, was able to come from behind to defeat Wu Hui Ju to keep Korea in contention for two medals.\nWith only four archers left, the semifinals featured 12-arrow matches. The two winners faced each other in the gold medal match, while the losers of the semifinals faced off for the bronze medal. For the third round in a row, Park Sung-hyun posted the high score, this time with a 110.\nLee Sung Jin and Yuan Shu Chi were the first two archers to compete. The first end resulted in a tie at 27. Lee began to pull away in the second end, scoring 26 to Shu's 24. In each of the third and fourth ends, Lee increased his lead, finishing with a safe 6-point victory to advance to the final. Park and Alison Williamson were next. Williamson's surprising run for gold came to a crash, as Park continued to be nearly perfect. Once again, Park did not score lower than 27 in any end of three arrows, dominating each end and advancing to face fellow Korean Lee in the finals.\nThe bronze medal match pitted Yuan Shu Chi, who had started with a 6th place in the ranking round, against Alison Williamson, who had started at 21st. Each archer fired four ends of three arrows, with the winner receiving a bronze medal while the loser would go home with a 4th-place finish and no medal.\nThe first end was a good one for both archers, with Yuan scoring a 10 and two 9s while Williamson matched the score with two 10s and an 8. Yuan kept up the pace with another 28 in the second end, as Williamson faltered slightly and dropped 3 points behind with a 25. Williamson caught up in the third end, however, with a 27 to Yuan's 25. Yuan took the lead again with the first arrow of the last end, but again Williamson brought it back to a tie with the second arrow. With the score tied and one arrow remaining, Williamson shot an 8 to Yuan's 7, claiming the bronze medal.\nThe women's gold medal match pitted two Koreans against each other. The two had dominated the competition from the beginning, with Park Sung-hyun placing 1st in the ranking round and Lee Sung Jin placing 2nd.\nIn the first end, Park shot a rare 26, breaking a long string of ends no lower than 27. Lee matched the score, then hit a perfect 30 in the second end. Park returned to form in the second end with a 27, but this still left her 3 points behind. Park continued to build on her scores with a 28 in the third end, bringing the match to 2 points when Lee shot a 27. The fourth end was Park's best of the match while it was Lee's worst, as Park reversed the deficit with a 29–25 final end to take the gold, 110–108. Lee received a silver medal."

Chinese Taipei narrowly defeated the United States to avoid the upset.\nBoth teams in the bronze medal final shot their lowest score of the competition. The United States, who had outscored Ukraine in each of the previous rounds, was unable to do so in direct competition with the Ukrainians and fell to fourth place while the Ukrainians collected their first archery medal of the year.\nThe final turned out to be the easiest victory for the Korean team in the entire tournament, a 6-point win over Chinese Taipei.\nBronze Medal Match: def. 237-235"

        "text": "Sergio Jose Santos (born July 4, 1983) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago White Sox, Toronto Blue Jays, Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees.\nDraft and career as a shortstop.\nSantos, who is of Mexican American descent, was drafted out of Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, California by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the first round of the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft. Between 2002 and 2005, Santos steadily worked his way up through the Diamondbacks' farm system all the way to Triple-A Tucson, where he hit 21 doubles and 12 home runs in 2005.\nOn December 27, 2005, Santos was sent to Toronto Blue Jays along with Troy Glaus in exchange for Miguel Batista and Orlando Hudson. In 2006, he hit .214 with 5 home runs and 38 RBI in 128 games with Toronto's Triple-A affiliate, the Syracuse Chiefs. He attended the Blue Jays' 2007 spring training, but did not make the active 25-man roster. After his struggles at Triple-A Syracuse in 2006, Toronto assigned Santos to their Double-A affiliate, the New Hampshire Fisher Cats for the 2007 season. Santos won the Home Run Derby preceding the Eastern League All Star game in 2007 at Dodd Stadium.\nOn May 13, 2008, Santos was claimed off waivers by the Minnesota Twins. He became a free agent at the end of the season and signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox, but on March 20, 2009, was traded to the San Francisco Giants in exchange for future considerations. Less than two weeks after the trade he was brought back to the White Sox organization and sent to extended spring training to convert from infielder to pitcher.\nPitching career.\nChicago White Sox.\nSantos pitched at four levels of the Sox minor league system in 2009, beginning at the Single-A Kannapolis Intimidators and ending at Triple-A Charlotte Knights. He posted a combined ERA of 8.16, but struck out more than a batter an inning.\nOn March 30, 2010, Santos was named to the White Sox opening day active roster. He won the 7th and final spot in the bullpen over Greg Aquino.\nSantos earned his first major league win by pitching two innings of shutout baseball, striking out two in an 11 inning win over the Detroit Tigers on August 5, 2010.\nHe established a new Major League record with his 25th straight scoreless appearance on the road to start a season in a 6–3 win over the Baltimore Orioles at Camden Yards on August 11, 2011. Mariano Rivera had previously held the record since 2005. Santos' achievement was actually part of a longer such streak of 30 which began in the previous campaign.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nOn December 6, 2011, he was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for Néstor Molina. Santos was expected to act as the closer for the Jays, while veteran Francisco Cordero would be the setup pitcher.\nSantos made his first appearance as a Blue Jay on Opening Day 2012, getting the final 2 outs in a 16 inning win against the Cleveland Indians, the longest game in Opening Day history. Santos was placed on the 15-day disabled list on April 21 due to right shoulder inflammation. He was later transferred to the 60-day disabled list. On July 15, it was announced that Santos would need season-ending surgery on his right shoulder. He made 6 appearances for the Blue Jays in 2012, posting a 0-1 record with a 9.00 ERA and 2 saves in 4 chances.\nSantos pitched through 2013 Spring Training with the Blue Jays and made the team, but was not selected to be the closer, with manager John Gibbons electing to use Casey Janssen instead of Santos. On April 15, Santos was placed on the 15-day DL with a triceps strain. On May 14, it was revealed that Santos would require surgery on his right elbow to clean out some bone spurs and chips. On August 1, Santos was activated from the 60-day disabled list by the Blue Jays and called up to replace Dustin McGowan, who was placed on the 15-day disabled list.\nSantos began the 2014 season as the closer for the Blue Jays, due to an injury to Casey Janssen. Santos converted his first 5 save chances, but proceeded to blow his next 3 opportunities, raising his ERA to over 10. On May 3, he was replaced as closer by Aaron Loup. Santos was designated for assignment by the Blue Jays on July 21. He cleared waivers and was assigned to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons on July 23. His contract was selected from Buffalo on August 23. The Blue Jays designated Santos for assignment again on August 27, after he made two unsuccessful appearances with the big league club. On September 1, he was outrighted to the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats. Santos finished the 2014 season with a 0–3 record, 5 saves, 8.57 ERA, 29 strikeouts, and a 2.19 WHIP in 26 appearances totaling 21 innings pitched.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nOn January 8, 2015, he agreed to a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was assigned to the AAA Oklahoma City Dodgers. The Dodgers promoted him to the MLB roster on April 24. He was designated for assignment on May 27 and removed from the 40-man roster. In 12 games with the Dodgers, he had a 4.73 ERA. He cleared waivers and elected to become a free agent rather than return to the minors.\nNew York Yankees.\nOn June 9, 2015, Santos agreed on a minor league deal with the New York Yankees. The Yankees promoted him to the major leagues on June 13. He was placed on the disabled list on June 19 with right elbow inflammation, after just two appearances with the Yankees. On June 21, it was reported that he would undergo Tommy John surgery. On November 2, he was outrighted and immediately elected free agency.\nPost–playing career.\nNew York Yankees.\nSantos was named manager of the Hudson Valley Renegades the High-A affiliate of the New York Yankees for 2023.\nChicago White Sox.\nOn January 19, 2024, the Chicago White Sox hired Santos to serve as the manager for their Double–A affiliate, the Birmingham Barons.\nPitching style.\nSantos throws a hard four-seam fastball with movement in the 96-97 mph range, as well as an 87 mph slider and a changeup."

        "text": "Pedro Modesto García (born April 17, 1950) is a Puerto Rican former professional baseball second baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Milwaukee Brewers, Detroit Tigers, and Toronto Blue Jays.\nCareer.\nMilwaukee Brewers (1973-1976).\nGarcia signed as an amateur free agent with the Seattle Pilots in 1969, but did not appear with the franchise before it became the Milwaukee Brewers in 1970.\nWith the departure of Ron Theobald, Garcia was named the Brewers' starting second baseman for the 1973 season, and made his Major League debut on April 6, going hitless in three at-bats against Dave McNally in a 10-0 loss to the Baltimore Orioles. Garcia earned his first career hit the next day, a home run against the Orioles' Mike Cuellar in an extra inning 8-7 loss.\nAs a rookie, Garcia hit .245 with 15 HR and 54 RBI in 160 games, as well as leading the American League with 32 doubles, as he finished second in American League Rookie of the Year voting to Al Bumbry of the Baltimore Orioles. Garcia also led all AL second basemen with 27 errors.\nIn 1974, Garcia batted .199 with 12 HR and 54 RBI in 147 games.\nIn 1975, Garcia lost playing time to Kurt Bevacqua and Bob Sheldon, appearing in only 98 games, hitting .225 with 6 HR and 38 RBI, although he tied Robin Yount for the team high in stolen bases with 12. Garcia also led the American League with a .985 fielding percentage at second base.\nGarcia began the 1976 season with the Brewers, where in 41 games, he hit .217 with one home run and 9 RBI. On June 10, the Brewers traded Garcia to the Detroit Tigers for Gary Sutherland.\nDetroit Tigers (1976).\nGarcia finished the 1976 season with the Detroit Tigers, as he played in 77 games, hitting only .198 with 3 HR and 20 RBI. Garcia also committed a combined 22 errors with the Tigers and Milwaukee Brewers in 1976 to finish with the second highest total among second basemen. On December 16, the Tigers released Garcia.\nToronto Blue Jays (1977).\nGarcia signed as a free agent with the expansion Toronto Blue Jays on January 3, 1977, and was their opening day second baseman on April 7. Garcia had three hits in the Blue Jays' opening day victory over the Chicago White Sox, and was able to parlay this strong start into a gig as the Blue Jays' regular second baseman through April, and again from May 9 through 25. However he struggled at both the plate and in the field, and after May 25 was reduced to very occasional pinch-running and DH appearances. He was released on June 27, becoming the first opening day Blue Jay to end his major league career. In 41 games, he hit .208 with no home runs and 9 RBI.\nLater career.\nAfter his time with Toronto, Garcia signed with the San Diego Padres on July 5, 1977, but he spent the rest of the 1977 and 1978 seasons with their AAA affiliate, the Hawaii Islanders. Garcia played with the Poza Rica Petroleros of the Mexican League in 1979, as well as the Mexico City Diablos Rojos in 1982."

Titus’ most notable accomplishment was that he led the National League (NL) in being hit by pitches (16), in 1909 and ranks 74th on the MLB career Hit By Pitch list (94).\nTo baseball card collectors, Titus is also notable for the card depicting him in the T206 set, as it is the only one in which the player has a mustache. At the time of his death, it was noted that Titus was the last player to sport a handlebar mustache. It was noted when Titus shaved his mustache during spring training in March 1908.\nIn 11 big league seasons, Titus played in 1,402 games and had 4,960 at bats, 738 runs, 1,401 hits, 253 doubles, 72 triples, 38 home runs, 564 RBI, 140 stolen bases, 620 walks, a .282 batting average, a .373 on-base percentage, a .385 slugging percentage, 1,912 total bases, and 144 sacrifice hits.\nOn January 8, 1943, Titus died in his hometown of St. Clair, Pennsylvania, at the age of 66."

        "title": "Keith Murdoch (rugby union)",
        "text": "Keith Murdoch (9 September 1943 – 27 February 2018) was a New Zealand rugby union player.\nBiography.\nMurdoch, a prop, played for Otago from 1964 to 1972, except for one season each for Hawke's Bay (1965) and Auckland (1966). He represented New Zealand from 1970 to 1972, playing in 27 matches for the All Blacks, including three test matches. He toured with the All Blacks to South Africa on the 1970 tour and to Great Britain and Ireland on the 1972 tour, but was troubled by injury throughout both series.\nMurdoch had a history of unprovoked physical interactions with journalists. In 1971, he responded to a request from a New Zealand journalist for an interview by inviting him into the changing room, then holding the man under a shower until he was drenched. On the 1972 tour of Ireland and Britain , when another New Zealand journalist foiled a practical joke that Murdoch was playing, Murdoch dragged him to the floor by his scalp. Murdoch also allegedly threatened a cartoonist on the same tour.\n1972 tour of Ireland and Britain.\nMurdoch's career ended controversially after he was sent home from New Zealand's tour. He scored the All Blacks' only try in their 1972 win against Wales in Cardiff, but later the same night was involved in a fracas in which he punched security guard Peter Grant at the Angel Hotel. He also played in famous Llanelli v New Zealand match in which the Scarlets spectacularly won 9–3. He was later sent home from the tour by All Black management, reputedly after pressure was brought to bear by the home rugby unions.\nHowever, in 2019, Moyra Pearce, the daughter of Ernie Todd who was the manager of the 1972 tour, stated that Murdoch was not – as had always been alleged – sent home for assaulting a security guard. Instead, she claimed that Murdoch threatened and chased a female member of staff at the hotel who refused to open the bar for him. Welsh police told Todd that charges would be brought on the following Monday unless Murdoch was out of the country by then. To save Murdoch from prosecution, Todd concocted the story and sent Murdoch home. Bob Burgess, another New Zealand player on the tour, stated that he had never heard anything about a woman being involved, while team captain Ian Kirkpatrick stated that the claim was \"news to me\".\nAlthough reporters waited in Auckland at the airport for his flight to arrive, he instead switched flights in Singapore on a stop-over, and flew to Perth, from where he headed into the Outback, quitting rugby forever. He was always invited to All Black rugby reunions, and a chair was always left empty for him should he turn up, although he never did. To this day, whenever the All Blacks visit Cardiff, they have an informal meeting nicknamed 'The Murdoch Memorial' at the Angel Hotel.\nSubsequent life.\nNew Zealand Rugby tried hard to locate him but failed: in the 50 years after his disappearance, he was only traced by journalists four times. New Zealand rugby journalist Terry McLean traced him to an oil rig near Perth in 1974, but was ignored and dismissed by Murdoch. Murdoch lived for a year in New Zealand in the mid-1970s, working as a bushman in a job organised by former All Black teammate Graham Whiting.\nIn 1980, Murdoch was back in New Zealand, working on an Otago farm when he saved a 3-year-old child from drowning in a backyard swimming pool by providing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. When the local newspaper heard and came to the farm to interview him, he was nowhere in sight, and subsequently moved back to Australia. Margot McRae, an ABC producer, located him in Tully, a remote town in Northern Australia. When she interviewed him, he explained that leading a nomadic life and always being on the move was exactly how he wanted to live. When McRae returned the next day with a camera crew, Murdoch ran away.\nIn 2001 Murdoch came to public attention in connection with an inquest into the death of an Aboriginal man, Christopher Kumanjai Limerick, who was found dead at an abandoned mine. The cause of death was not certain because of decomposition, but he seems to have fallen when attempting to reach water at the bottom of the mine. The coroner suspected that he may have been forcibly taken from the town of Tennant Creek and abandoned at the mine in the heat without food or water, saying that there was evidence of assault. The last time he was seen in the town was when trying to break into a house where Murdoch and others resided, and Murdoch had allegedly chased him away. Murdoch remarked after Limerick's disappearance that \"I don't think he'll come back.\"\nInitially, Murdoch could not be located, but was subsequently called in as a critical witness. Police eventually tracked him down to a remote cattle station hundreds of miles away, and he came to give evidence, refusing all questions from reporters. He was criticised by the coroner for the cavalier manner in which he gave his evidence, and the coroner alleged that he was lying in order to protect himself and any associates from being charged with a crime. No charges were laid due to lack of evidence.\nMurdoch spent his last years living in the Western Australian town of Carnarvon, where he died on 27 February 2018.\nHe was posthumously awarded his rugby test cap.\nHis local \"drinking mates\" did not know of his rugby past.\nLegacy.\nA play, \"Finding Murdoch\" by Margot McRae, which premiered in Wellington in 2007, is about McRae's tracking down of Murdoch. She says of the media frenzy when he punched a security guard that \"If there's a baddie it would be the media\". Some 1972 team-mates feel guilty about not supporting him."

After the sponsorship arrangement expired, BikeNZ got close to becoming insolvent. Under its new chief executive officer, Andrew Matheson, BikeNZ was rebranded as Cycling New Zealand in December 2014.\nAssociation with Cycling Action Network.\nCycling Action Network (CAN), formerly known as Cycling Advocates' Network, another New Zealand cycling organisation, was one of the founding members of BikeNZ and provided one board member from BikeNZ's inception in July 2003.

Heron's independent review found there was a dysfunctional culture within Cycling NZ's high performance programme from 2016 until early 2018. Heron found that there had been bullying, but the broad consensus was that it was concentrated around a coach, and there was no evidence of \"a widespread, systemic culture of bullying\". He was satisfied that a coach and an athlete had an inappropriate relationship. He found there had been a dysfunctional culture, but not a drinking culture, save for a few individuals, the coach being one of them. He found there had been a lack of accountability at Cycling NZ.\nFollowing the 2021 sudden death of Olivia Podmore, CNZ and High Performance Sport New Zealand (HPSNZ) appointed Herron and Professor Sarah Leberman to co-chair an inquiry. Also sitting on the panel are Dr Lesley Nicol and rowing Olympic medalist, Genevieve Macky. The terms of reference of the inquiry included:\nAn independent investigation into Cycling New Zealand's handling of athlete selection for the 2020 Olympics uncovered the breach of both Olympic and international cycling regulations. The investigation revealed that the process to replace an athlete during an event in Tokyo didn't respect IOC and UCI rules. High Performance Director Martin Barras resigned after confirmation of an \"integrity breach\" during the Tokyo Olympics. Jacques Landry, the Chief Executive Officer, also resigned."

        "title": "Cycling Ireland",
        "text": "Cycling Ireland () or CI is the operating name of the national governing body of the sport of cycling in the island of Ireland. Formally the body is a charitable company limited by guarantee, the Irish Cycling Federation.\nCI is a member of the UCI and the UEC, often called the European Cycling Union. CI is made up of cycling clubs, whose delegates have full voting rights, and whose members can also register individually. There are four provincial associations within CI, to which individual clubs also affiliate: Cycling Connacht, Cycling Leinster, Cycling Munster and Cycling Ulster.\nHistory.\nThe governance of cycling in Ireland has been profoundly affected by the country's turbulent history, particularly in the post-partition era.\nEarly period, the ICA and the GAA.\nIn 1878, competitive and team cycling in Ireland was administered by the Irish Cycling Association (ICA). In 1884 the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) was formed to preserve native pastimes, and cycling began to feature at GAA meetings. The ICA was composed mainly of unionists and moderate nationalists from urban areas, whereas the GAA cyclists were mostly from rural areas and tended to hold strong nationalist views. Conflict arose between the two rival groups.\nIreland was partitioned in 1921 and the Irish Free State was established in 1922. The National Athletic and Cycling Association of Ireland (NACA or NACAI) was formed to administer cycling and athletics, retaining strong links with the GAA. The new body suffered disputes between its central council representatives from Northern Ireland and those from the south.\nIn 1937, administration of cycling was given to the National Cycling Association (NCA), an all-Ireland organisation \"carved out\" from within the NACA, and like the NACA and the GAA, with a 32-county purview.\nIn 1947 the world governing sport of cycling, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), decreed that the NCA should confine its area of jurisdiction to the 26 counties of what was to shortly become (in April 1949) the Republic of Ireland. The NCA refused and as a result was expelled from the UCI.\nWithin Northern Ireland, cyclists were divided largely according to their social and political affiliations.\nCRÉ and the ICF.\nIn 1949, several Irish cycling clubs broke away from the NCA and formed a cycling governing body that would restrict its area of jurisdiction to state of Ireland, as directed by the UCI, \"Cumann Rothaiochta na hÉireann\" (CRÉ). In the same year, a breakaway group in Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Cycling Federation, successfully applied for official recognition to the UCI and also formed an association with the British Cycling Federation.\nIn 1955, participation at international events had become a grievance of the nationalists. At the world amateur championships, an unofficial NCA team tried to line up alongside the official (CRÉ/NICF) Irish team, leading to fighting.\nCRÉ was replaced by the Irish Cycling Federation (ICF) in 1967. NACA remained in existence, and its cycling branch, the NCA, continued to organise cycling north and south of the border, as well as continuing its association with the GAA.\nTowards cooperation.\nSince there were now two official national governing bodies north and south of the border, the two bodies co-operated to enter all-Ireland teams in international competitions.\nIn 1972 the ICF sent a team to represent Ireland at the Munich Olympics. The NCA sent a squad selected from the entire 32 counties who ended up attacking some of the members of the ICF team during the road race.\nThe Tripartite Committee.\nIn 1979 the Irish Cycling Tripartite Committee (ICTC) was set up between the ICF, NCA, and NICF as a forum within which differences between the associations could be worked out and joint racing ventures organised. The Northern Ireland Cycling Federation (NICF) continued to affiliate to the world body (now the International Amateur Cycling Federation or FIAC) as an independent entity and to pay its own fees.\nRegulations enacted in 1986 stated that only one fee will be accepted from each designated nation, and the NICF's fee was hence rejected, with Irish affiliation to the FIAC passing to the ICTC. This led to proposals for amalgamation of the three governing bodies. This proved acceptable to both the ICF and the NCA, but caused a split within the NICF. A vote to accept the merger was challenged in the High Court where it was overturned.\nFIC.\nIn 1987 the IFC, NCA and Irish Cycling Tripartite Committee formed the Federation of Irish Cyclists (FIC). NICF members who supported the change (nearly 75% of members, and 70% of the clubs) formed a new body, the Ulster Cycling Federation (UCF), which affiliated to the FIC, which was then admitted to the FIAC in September 1988 as the sole governing body for the island of Ireland. In Northern Ireland, cycling continued to be split between two groups. Funding from the Sports Council for Northern Ireland was channelled to the officially recognised UCF, whereas Unionist local councils chose to support the NICF, again illustrating how sport can become bound up in Northern Ireland's political conflict.\nNICF.\nNICF members felt that, as British citizens, they were entitled to join the BCF. However, for several years the UCI blocked this, stating that the NICF riders should take licences from the FIC. In 1992, the UCI relented and permitted NICF members to race under BCF licences. However, the NICF was not permitted to take any fuller part in the BCF, and has to occupy a semi-detached status. The UCI unsuccessfully attempted to further reconcile the NICF and the FIC.\nIn 1995 the annual meeting of the BCF granted the NICF the same status as regional governing bodies in Scotland and Wales, and in 2001 the BCF placed the Tour of the North, an Ulster-based race, on its Premier Calendar. This proved too much for the UCI, which resolved at its 2002 congress in Zolder to restrict the actions of the BCF and NICF in Northern Ireland, and to restate that the FIC was the sole body for cycling in the entire island.\nAn agreement to implement the UCI ruling was reached in 2004 with British Cycling (the new name for the BCF) and Cycling Ireland (the new name for the ICF).\nIn 2006 the NICF held a special general meeting to amalgamate with Cycling Ulster, starting in 2007, and operating as a \"promotional group\". All NICF clubs would switch affiliation from British Cycling to Cycling Ireland. Cycling Ireland members would still be able to opt for their preferred nationality on the licence, preserving political and cultural identities.\nCycling Ireland.\n2013 saw the 25th Anniversary of Cycling Ireland, and in recognition the Annual Awards Night was a celebration of cycling past and present, with Membership Awards being awarded in conjunction with the launch of the Cycling Ireland Hall of Fame. The Irish International Rider of the Year, as voted by the Sports Journalists, was also introduced.\nRegional bodies.\nCycling Ireland governs the sport on a provincial basis, with four sub bodies affiliating to the national body. These are Cycling Ulster, Cycling Leinster, Cycling Connacht, and Cycling Munster.\nName.\nCycling Ireland is the trading and operating name of the body formally known as the Irish Cycling Federation.\nInfluence.\nCycling Ireland administers road racing, track racing, off-road or MTB racing, time trialing, BMX, Cyclocross, and is involved in the promotion of leisure cycling events.\nDevelopment programs.\nThrough the Coach Education Unit, Cycling Ireland run a range of cycling programs to encourage more people to participate in cycling as an activity, and to develop leading cyclists.\nSprocket Rocket (launched in 2010).\n\"Sprocket Rocket\" was launched at the end of 2010 with the aim of teaching children better cycling skills, setting them up for a lifetime of enjoyment from their bike. Sprocket Rocket focuses on the four main skills involved in cycling; balance, braking, cornering and pedalling, and it works through three \"progressions.\" The focus of the Sprocket Rocket Programme is on fun, learning, and the individual. This means that kids from age 5-11 can improve and progress at their own pace, within a structured programme that is run in an enclosed and safe environment. Sprocket Rocket can be run in a variety of ways, from a three-session intense programme to an in-depth twelve-week course. This basic skills programme works particularly well in a school and club setting, but also has been delivered to a range of groups from Brownies to summer camps.\nAs part of the promotion of Sprocket Rocket, and the promotion of cycling skills as a fun activity for kids, many big events host Sprocket Rocket Taster Sessions, whereby children get an introduction to the cycling skills by means of an obstacle course. Every June the National Sprocket Rocket Family Cycling Festival takes place during Bike Week, with cycling activities for all ages. The zones vary from basic and advanced Sprocket Rocket skills zones to MTB, Balance Bikes and Paracycling Zones, which are run in partnership with the Irish Wheelchair Association.\nWith cycling being an activity that can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of their ability, Sprocket Rocket is a programme that engages with specialist groups like Cerebral Palsy Ireland, Special Olympics Ireland and Dyspraxia Ireland, in an effort to make cycling more accessible.\nBike for Life (launched in 2013).\nThis is a beginner's cycling programme that caters for all cyclists, from the person who has just rediscovered their bike, to the more accomplished rider who wants to take on greater challenges. Delivered by qualified coaches, the 10-week programme brings the cyclist on a journey of learning, where they are educated on the various skills, aspects and components of cycling in a safe, welcoming and social environment.\nBike for Life is sponsored by the HSE, the national health authority, under their \"Get Ireland Active\" initiative, as well as receiving funding from Women in Sport. One of the aims of Bike for Life is to close the gender gap in cycling through the creation of “Meet and Spin” groups of people of similar speeds and ability. Matt Cooper from Today FM and international cyclist Caroline Ryan are the two ambassadors for the programme. At the Launch of Bike for Life last month Matt Cooper said “Bike for Life should transform how people view cycling. It’s a new programme that connects people who want to improve their cycling, no matter what level they are at, and I am really happy to endorse it.”\nGearing Up Off-Road (launched in 2011).\nThis is a beginner's mountain bike programme that can be delivered in a variety of ways, whether it is a 10-week programme, or run over an intensive weekend. Throughout Gearing Up Off-Road the rider is brought through various steps, learning specific MTB skills from qualified coaches and Trail Cycle Leaders. This programme can be delivered in a range of settings, from secondary school environments to adventure centres. With the main focus of Gearing Up Off-Road being on the acquisition of skills, this can be delivered in any setting, from a mountain bike trail to a field, with props to replicate the off-road environment. Every session includes a ride out after the coaching session.\nTalent Team 2020.\nYouth Cycling has a strong tradition in Ireland, with riders being encouraged to participate in all disciplines to ensure they become more rounded riders.\nTo assist in the development of skills, knowledge and competence in young riders, the Talent Team 2020 was born. The aim of this development training and racing programme is to nurture and develop young talent at this early age, in order to produce medal winning squads at the 2020 Olympic Games.\nFBD is the sponsor of the Male Talent Team 2020, which is managed by Martin O'Loughlin. Neenan Travel is the sponsor of the Female Talent Team 2020, which is managed by Orla Hendron.\nTwo of professional cycling's top riders in the 1980s, Sean Kelly and Stephen Roche, have had a profound effect on Irish cycling. Cycling Ireland's headquarters is called Kelly Roche House in their honour.\nPrevious Programs.\nSean Kelly Cycling Academy (2005).\nIn 2005, Cycling Ireland opened the Sean Kelly Cycling Academy, a facility in Merchtem, Belgium as a base for Irish cyclists on the continent where they can gain experience of racing at a much higher standard than in they would in Ireland. It gives Irish riders access to UCI ranked events where they compete against elite professional riders. This facility was partly funded by the Irish Sports Council.\nSean Kelly remained involved in the promotion of Irish cycling by working in the management of the new Irish continental team, the An Post–M Donnelly–Grant Thornton–Sean Kelly Team."

The ninth skeleton (of the title) has no infant skeleton, but is still in the grave, and attempts to pull the narrator in. However, he awakes to normal reality, apparently due to the touch of Guenevere on his arm.\nThe opening of the story features an accurate description of the area of Boulder Ridge in Auburn, California where Smith lived most of his early life.\nReception.\nReviewing \"Genius Loci and Other Tales\" in the 1983 book \"The Guide to Supernatural Fiction\", E. F. Bleiler recommended the \"best stories are \"The Ninth Skeleton\", \"The Phantoms of the Fire\", which is well-handled if trite in theme, and \"The Charnel God\".\""

In the second half of 1884, a year before the birth of the FCI, there were 25 regularly established cycling societies: the oldest of these was the \"Veloce Club Fiorentino\" in Florence, established in 1870, while Milan and Turin each hosted three velocipedes societies.\nAn initial attempt to unite and coordinate the activities of these sports clubs was made on the occasion of the competitions staged by the Sports Committee of the Italian General Exhibition in Turin, scheduled for August 23–25, 1884. At the initiative of lawyer Brignone, secretary of the VC Torino, representatives of twelve societies met and, after a complex and contentious meeting, signed minutes specifying, among other things, that the \"Unione Velocipedistica Italiana\" had been founded on August 26, 1884. This organization, however, never operated, having failed to resolve certain issues then detriments, such as issues related to professionalism, amateur activity and the headquarters of the fledgling organization.\nIn 1992 the Organisation stopped many riders from turning professional before the Olympic games road race as only amateurs could compete.\nControversy.\nWhen Gino Bartali won the 1938 Tour de France, unlike with other victorious athletes at the time, the FCI did not celebrate his victory. Bartali was very Anti-fascism which did not bode well living in the Kingdom of Italy under the rule of Benito Mussolini. After not praising the Government for his victory Mussolini canceled a special medal ceremony and the head of the FCI did not attend his victory lap of the velodrome.\nAbuse.\nIn 2019 an investigation was opened to look at the alleged psychological harassment by Women's National Team coach Edoardo Salvoldi. The alleged abuse was said to have started in 2005 when Savoldi joined the FCI. Silvio Martinello complained that a coach in the FCI was using \"psychological conditioning\" on athletes which he deemed inappropriate. Maila Andreotti, an athlete coached by Salvoldi came forward saying she quit cycling because of his methods."

Cycling Zimbabwe is a member of the Confédération Africaine de Cyclisme and is also affiliated to the Zimbabwe Olympic Committee.\nHistory.\nDue to its warm climate, cycling in Zimbabwe has always been a popular past time, supported by a thriving Road, BMX and MTB club circuit, Zimbabwe Cycling has over the years punched well above its weight in terms of its achievements internationally. Zimbabwe first gained prominence on the world stage when shortly after independence from colonial Britain sent a road and track team to the 1980 Summer Olympics held in Moscow. The team consisted of Michael McBeath, John Musa and David Gillow – (the latter’s daughter Shara Gillow now riding for FDJ Nouvelle-Aquitaine Futuroscope). Throughout the 1980s Graham Cockerton competed as a professional in South Africa riding in the well known Rapport Tour. In 1988 Zimbabwe again sent a squad consisting of Pierre Gouws and Gary Mandy to the 1988 Summer Olympics in South Korea.\nIn 1991, Gary Mandy turned from rider to team manager/coach and took Steve Draver, Kurt Begemann, Andrew Allen and Justin Marabini to the 5th, All Africa Games, in Cairo Egypt. The team won the bronze medal for the 100 km Team Time Trial, in 2 hrs and 12 minutes, using standard road bikes with clip on aero bars and disc wheels. This same year, the federation funded a Junior Team to the World Junior Cycling Championships in Colorado, USA. This team comprised Alan Harrison, Nathan Jones, Jason Whitehead and Gary Ohara.\nAfter their success in Egypt, Zimbabwe fielded many National Teams to races such as The Tour Of Mauritius and South Africa's Giro del Capo. These teams gave birth to Zimbabwe’s first European Pro Timothy Jones (cyclist) who competed for Zimbabwe at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta USA. Tim Jones won the Giro del Capo in 1998. Zimbabwe produced another climbing specialist at this time, Chris Hoffman, who was National Road Race and Time Trial champion from 1997 to 1999, and drafted by the Ster-Kinekor cycling team in South Africa. Hoffman then went on to race professionally with Tim Jones developing him in Europe, and represented Zimbabwe at the 2000 World Championships.\nIn 2005 former World Champion Belgian Roger De Vlaeminck sent a scouting team to the country with a view to creating Zimbabwe’s first ever Cyclocross team, a team was selected which raced in the Under 23 World Cyclocross championships held in St Wendel Germany with this being covered by VTM (TV channel) in their popular cycling reality television show Allez Allez.\n2006 saw Linda Davidson win bronze in the time trial at the African Road Championships held in Port Louis, Mauritius\n2007 saw Zimbabwe further make history when they sent a 9 member squad to the very first African Mountain Bike Championships that were held in Windhoek Namibia . Zimbabwe fared well with Margie Gibson attaining Gold in the Veteran Ladies Cross Country and Trevor Volker Bronze in the SV Cross Country races. Antipas Kwari by finishing 8th in the Elite &amp; U23 Race ensured qualification for the 2008 Olympic Games- a race in which he finished 48th in the men’s cross country.\nMore recently Zimbabwe has been represented internationally by Skye Davidson who raced at the 2019 UCI Elite World Championships which were held in Yorkshire, England.\nIn 2022 Cycling Zimbabwe undertook a rebranding exercise with a new look and feel being applied to its organisation's logo with the new branding being in use at the 2023 National Road Cycling Championships that were held in Bulawayo."

        "text": "The Royal Spanish Cycling Federation or RFEC (in Spanish: \"Real Federación Española de Ciclismo\") is the national governing body of cycle racing in Spain. As of 2022, the federation has 3,729 registered clubs and 74,675 federated cyclists.\nHistory.\nThe organization was originally founded as the ().\nAt the beginning of 1898, journalist Narciso Masferrer used \"Los Deportes\", which he had founded the year before, to became the main propagandist of the Catalan Cycling Union (), chaired by the doctor Manuel Duran i Ventosa, who created this entity to compete with the Madrid-based UVE. When the UVC was officially constituted in May 1898, Masferrer was elected its “publicist secretary”. Years later, in 1910, when Masferrer was already an established leader of Spanish cycling, he would make a public confession of his remorse for having supported a dissident entity. At the beginning of 1899, however, both the UVC and the UVE stood on the verge of collapse as a result of Spain's colonial disaster at the end of the Spanish–American War, and when a debacle in the UVE was sensed, Masferrer immediately began to apply for union, promoting the merger between the two federations through the pages of \"Los Deportes\" and through negotiations between the leaders of both entities. This campaign reached its peak with a meeting at the restaurant Ca l'Anguilero in Llobregat, convened by \"Los Deportes\" on 9 April \"to seal the union that exists among all\", which was attended by more than 240 cyclists. Despite his best efforts, however, Masferrer was unable to prevent the aforementioned debacle of the UVE (May 1899), which resulted in the annulment of their meeting and the resignation of the Madrid committee from the Spanish union. From this moment on, Masferrer became the leader of the movement to save the UVE, always using the pages of \"Los Deportes\" to speak, and following an appeal on 11 June, Masferrer held a negotiation with the president of the UVE, Claudi de Rialp, and the president of the Catalan committee of the Spanish Union, the architect Bonaventura Pollés, which lead to the seizure of federative power by these men and the transfer from the headquarters of the UVE to Barcelona, which materialized at the beginning of July 1899. This entire situation gave Masferrer a triumphant entry into the unionist movement, profiling himself as the true savior of the UVE through his efforts and his journalistic campaigns. At first, he remained in the background, behind Rialp and Pollés, but he soon came to the front. In fact, some of the most important decisions of the UVE congress of December 1899 are the result of Masferrer's proposals, and his growing role within the federation is immediately made clear when he is appointed delegate, that is, the spokesman for the UVE congress held in Barcelona in December 1900, before being elected the president a year later, replacing Claudi de Rialp.\nScope.\nIt covers the disciplines of road racing, track cycling, cyclo-cross, BMX, mountain biking and cycle speedway.\nThe Federation is a member of the Union Cycliste Internationale and the Union Européenne de Cyclisme. It is based in Madrid."

        "title": "National Athletic and Cycling Association",
        "text": "The National Athletic and Cycling Association (NACA or N.A. and C.A.), from 1990 the National Athletic and Cycling Association of Ireland (NACAI or NACA(I)) was a federation of sports clubs in the island of Ireland practising athletics or bicycle racing or both. It existed from 1922 to 2000, though for most of the period it was not the sole governing body in Ireland for either sport. Its refusal to recognise the partition of Ireland got it expelled from the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) and the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI). Clubs formerly in the NACAI are now affiliated to Athletics Ireland or Cycling Ireland, each formed by the merger of the NACAI with rival bodies respectively affiliated to the IAAF and the UCI.\nFoundation.\nThe NACA was formed on 19 July 1922, from a merger of the Irish Amateur Athletic Association or IAAA (including its subsidiary the Cross Country Association of Ireland), the Irish Cycling Association (ICA) and the Athletics Council of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). The GAA was Irish nationalist and mainly rural, while the IAAA and ICA members were mainly unionists, universities, and the urban middle class. The IAAA was linked to the Amateur Athletic Association of England (AAA).\nThe unionist-dominated Northern Ireland and the nationalist Irish Free State had recently been separated politically, and the GAA was prepared to surrender its authority to ensure national unity in athletics and cycling and avoid a division which would reinforce the reality of partition. The GAA after 1923 thus restricted itself to Gaelic games, ceding athletics and cycling to NACA, with which it remained on friendly terms. John J. Keane, previously Chairman of the GAA Athletic Council, became first NACA President. Whereas the GAA had a ban on members of the RUC and British Army, the NACA narrowly voted not to introduce such a measure.\nThe NACA affiliated to the IAAF on 11 January 1924, and sent teams to the Olympics of 1924, 1928, and 1932. It also sent five athletes to the 1930 British Empire Games in Canada. In each case, the team was claimed to represent \"Ireland\" rather than the Irish Free State.\nIn 1937, the National Cycling Association (NCA) was formed as a NACA subsidiary for cycling clubs, and affiliated to the UCI. The Rás Tailteann was its headline event, an 8-day stage race whose name reflected the Tailteann Games.\nSplits and isolation.\nAlready by 1925 there was a split, with the Northern Ireland Amateur Athletic, Cycling and Cross Country Association (NIAAA) formed over a dispute concerning an Easter Monday sports meeting in Belfast, which as well as athletics featured greyhound racing and associated betting, which had been allowed by the IAAA but not by NACA. Since the meeting was to raise funds for Belfast Celtic F.C., with an Irish nationalist fanbase, the NACA alienated nationalists as well as unionists in Belfast. The NIAAA affiliated to the English AAA in 1930, with its unionist president Thomas Moles encouraging links within the UK, and Dawson Bates, the NI Home Affairs minister, lobbying the AAA.\nIn 1931, Eoin O'Duffy was president of the NACA, and raised at the IAAF the dispute with the British AAA over jurisdiction over Northern Ireland. The IAAF deferred a decision till its conference at the 1932 Olympics. In the meantime O'Duffy tried to resolve the matter by proposing an Irish Amateur Athletic Union (IAAU) in negotiations between NACA and the NIAAA, to have an agreed flag containing the arms of the four provinces on a background of St Patrick's Blue. However, the proposal foundered when an NACA general meeting insisted that the flag used at international events be the Irish tricolour rather than the IAAU flag. The IAAF decided in 1932 not to intervene in the Northern jurisdiction dispute.\nIn 1934, the IAAF amended its constitution to require member associations to be delimited by international political boundaries. After a year's delay, the NACA council voted 24 to 27 to reject the IAAF decision and was suspended the following month. There was no Irish team at the 1936 Olympics, other Irish sports boycotting in solidarity with the NACA exclusion. In 1937, some clubs in the Irish Free State left NACA and formed an Irish Amateur Athletic Union (IAAU, the same name as the abortive 1932 proposal) whose remit excluded Northern Ireland. The IAAU applied to join the IAAF, but due to British objections to the name \"Ireland\" was required to rename itself the Amateur Athletic Union of Éire (AAUE). AAUE affiliation in 1938 meant the NACA was definitively expelled from the IAAF. Most Irish athletics clubs remained in NACA, and it was NACA that was affiliated to the Irish Olympic Council, though it was AAUE athletes who competed at the Olympics. Ronnie Delany's gold medal in the 1956 1500 m was not mentioned at the next NACA executive meeting. In 1959, Tom O'Riordan's scholarship with the Idaho State Bengals was jeopardised when he ran for his local NACA club while visiting home in Tralee. The AAUE, whose Secretary Louis Vandendries was on holiday, reported him to the IAAF, which suspended him; upon Vandendries' return he defused the controversy by informing the IAAF that O'Riordan was now in good standing with the AAUE.\nThe UCI emulated the IAAF in 1947 by requiring the NCA to disclaim Northern Ireland, expelling it when it refused. In 1949, several clubs broke away from the NCA to form (CRE), which would restrict its area of jurisdiction to the Republic of Ireland. The CRE was recognised by the UCI, as was the Northern Ireland Cycling Federation (NICF), formed the same year and linked to the British Cycling Federation. The CRE and NICF co-operated and organised the Tour of Ireland, which attracted fewer Irish cyclists than the NCA's Rás Tailteann but more from abroad. A joint CRE–NICF Ireland team competed in international events, from which the NCA was excluded. Rogue NCA teams joined the 1955 amateur world road race championship and the 1972 Olympics road race in protest at their exclusion.\nThe GAA had always co-operated with the NACA, and its ban on members playing British sports was extended to ban those competing in athletics and cycling events not authorised by the NACA. The NACA retained some international links, through the International Labour Sports Federation (CSIT). Joe Christle, NCA official and organiser of the Rás Tailteann, was both a socialist and physical force republican.\nDissolution.\nIn 1979, the Irish Cycling Tripartite Committee (ICTC) was formed to link the NCA, NICF, and ICF (Irish Cycling Federation, the successor to the CRE). In 1987 all three merged into the Federation of Irish Cyclists (FIC), now operating as Cycling Ireland.\nAfter many failed attempts at unification, Bord Luthchleas na hÉireann (BLÉ) was formed in 1967 by the merger of the AAUE and most clubs of the NACA. However, some NACA clubs refused to join BLÉ, though in 1987 the rump NACA reached agreement with BLÉ allowing joint international representation. The GAA officially tolerated BLÉ, but some county boards refused to co-operate with it, and the rule favouring the NACA was not repealed.\nIn 2000, both bodies were dissolved into the Athletics Association of Ireland, which forms Athletics Ireland together with the NIAAA.\nPresidents.\nThe presidents of the NACA were:"

Flannery was one for three and drove in the second run of the Padres' 3–0 victory.\nHis minor league success did not translate to major league success as he hit just .154 in 65 big league at bats, with his only extra base hit of the season being a triple. He split between the Padres and their triple A affiliate, the Hawaii Islanders. With Hawaii, Flannery batted .346, however, he hit only .240 in the majors that year. In , he only appeared in 37 games and batted .254.\nFlannery's first full major league season without spending any time in the minors was .

Team organist Danny Topaz would greet Flannery's plate appearances with the imposing strains of Wagner's \"Ride of the Valkyries\". His retirement announcement in 1989 resulted in an outpouring of gifts and attention. In his final game, the sellout crowd greeted his first plate appearance with a standing ovation so prolonged that the umpire had to stop play, and following the game, there was discussion on at least one call-in show of whether Flannery's number should be retired.\nCoaching career.\nAfter a two-year hiatus from baseball, he became manager of the Padres' Northwest League affiliate Spokane Indians in .

His final year there he scored 140 points in 66 games.\nPicard was drafted by the Whalers in the 9th round, 178th overall, in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft. He met with great success in the minor leagues, leading the American Hockey League with a franchise-record 56 goals for the Springfield Indians in 1991, while leading the team to its final Calder Cup championship.\nHowever, Picard would never translate his earlier success to the NHL. He never played a full season in the NHL and only played in at least half of the games in a season once, during the 1999 season. That season he also played in five playoff games, the only time he played in the NHL playoffs.\nFor the 2002 season Picard played in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga in Germany for the Adler Mannheim.

        "title": "Darryl Hill (American football)",
        "text": "Darryl Andre Hill (born October 21, 1943, in Washington, D.C.) is an athlete and businessman; in 1963 he started with the University of Maryland football team as the first African-American football player in any of the southern athletic conferences composed of formerly segregated white institutions. (In that era, Maryland competed in the Atlantic Coast Conference, which at the time consisted only of such institutions.) The only black player on the team until his senior year, Hill set two records that still stand: total yards receiving, and most passes caught in a single game.\nAfter college and graduate school, Hill was an early advocate of minority business enterprise. He became a ground-breaking businessman, with an entrepreneurial range that has included fine restaurants and green energy companies. In the 1990s, he also established business relations in Russia and China.\nEarly years.\nHill was the older of two children born to Kermit and Palestine Hill in Washington, D.C., where his mother raised him as a Catholic.\nHis family had a history as entrepreneurs. His father, Kermit, owned and operated Hill’s Transfer Company, which was one of the nation’s largest black-owned commercial trucking firms in the 1950s and 1960s. Both grandfathers were African American business owners. His great-grandfather, a Native American, was an entrepreneur and the first person of color to be hired by the Washington, D.C. Fire Department.\nHill attended public and parochial grade schools in D.C. and entered Jesuit Gonzaga College High School on an academic scholarship; he earned it by a competitive entrance examination. While at Gonzaga, he became the first African American to play football for the school, and in 1959 he led his team to the City Championship. In his senior year, Hill was named first team All DC Metropolitan in football. In track, he was Catholic League champion and record holder in the 400 yard dash and the long jump.\nCollege career.\nIn 1960 at the age of 16, Hill attended Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio, on a football scholarship, where he was the leading scorer and ground gainer on the freshman football team.\nIn 1961, he received a congressional appointment to the United States Naval Academy. He was the first black man to play football at Navy and one of the first to play at any military academy. He starred on Navy’s plebe team where he was the favorite target for future Dallas Cowboys quarterback and Pro Football Hall of Fame member Roger Staubach. Leading his team in all-purpose yardage, Hill helped them to an 8-1 record.\nAfter deciding to resign from the Naval Academy in 1962, Hill was recruited by future ESPN sports analyst Lee Corso, then an assistant coach at University of Maryland, to play for the Terps. Corso had been encouraged by Maryland head coach Tom Nugent to try to find a black athlete to play for his team. Hill was at first hesitant to transfer, saying, \"I'm no Jackie Robinson. I just want to play football.\" When told that it might be couple of years before another black man would be recruited, Hill relented. When Hill enrolled into Maryland in September 1962, he became the first African American to receive an athletic scholarship to play sports for a major university in the South. Maryland was a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Neither it nor the other two major athletic conferences in the South, the Southeastern Conference and the Southwest Conference (now part of the Big 12), had any African Americans playing football for any of their teams.\nAfter sitting out one year, Hill played his historic first game on September 21, 1963, at home against North Carolina State. Hill emerged as a top wide receiver for the team. He did not encounter too much racism from other players, but found that coaches and fans could be highly offensive. The Maryland team was protected by National Guard when it went out on the field at the University of South Carolina in Columbia. Nugent received a death threat by telephone and after the game, Hill's teammates helped him get through a crush of hostile fans. With the support of his teammates, Hill played out the season. When they traveled in the South, the team banded together, only staying at hotels and restaurants that would serve Hill. He finished with 43 catches, five short of the ACC record.\nAt the end of that season, the Terps played an away game against the Clemson University Tigers, who were led by coach Frank Howard. After Maryland announced that Hill was to play, Clemson threatened to leave the conference. Howard vowed that his team would not allow any black to play in their stadium, which was popularly known as \"Death Valley\" due to the power of their team. They threatened to pull out of the game if Maryland brought Hill. Hill’s mother, Palestine, was refused general entry to the ‘whites only’ stadium, but Clemson President Robert Edwards took Mrs. Hill to his private box. The game went on, and Darryl Hill set the ACC record in that game for pass receptions in a game, a record that stood for many years.\nBusiness career.\nAfter a short stint with the practice squad of the New York Jets, Hill entered graduate school and launched his business career. He worked to assist minorities to enter the business economy. In 1969, he became the first Executive Director of the Anacostia Economic Development Corporation in Washington, D.C. He next worked as Executive Director of the Washington, DC Business Development Center and the Greater Washington Business Center. Over ten years his organizations helped 2,500 minority-owned businesses with technical assistance, marketing and financing. He launched the first publicly owned MESBIC (Minority Enterprise Small Business Investment Company). President Richard Nixon appointed Hill as co-chairman of the National Minority Purchasing Council.\nIn 1977, Hill opened W.H. Bone &amp; Company, one of the first black-owned mainstream, fine dining restaurants in the nation.\nIn 1982, Hill moved to Alameda, California. He founded Pacific Energy Corporation and Polaris Energy, which were early green energy businesses. Polaris Energy operated on both coasts and was one of the nation’s largest minority-owned energy companies.\nIn 1991, Hill turned his business sights to Russia after the break-up of the Soviet Union. He engaged in a number of business ventures, including purchasing a major optical company in the city of Novosibirsk. He took his company Northstar International to Central Siberia, where he formed a forestry joint venture with the government of the Republic of Buryatia. Hill and Northstar also organized a venture in Belem, Brazil to recover sunken timber from the Amazon River.\nHill also formed a joint venture with Ideal Packaging Company which is one of the largest paperboard packaging companies in China. He obtained the exclusive marketing rights for North America.\nDuring the 1990s, Hill opened restaurants in Atlanta, Georgia, and Washington, D.C.\nIn 2003, Hill became Director of Major Gifts for the University of Maryland Department of Intercollegiate Athletics. During his tenure at Maryland, he completed one of the largest naming rights deals in the history of college athletics when he put together an agreement to name the football field Capital One Field.\nHill is Chairman of Kids Play USA Foundation, whose mission is to remove financial barriers from youth sports.\nDarryl Hill is currently the Chairman and CEO of Tilstar, LLC and Green Bean, LLC which hold cannabis dispensary licenses in Maryland and California respectively."

He attended the University of North Dakota the following season, and although his college career got off to a slow start, he showed steady improvement and recorded 23 goals by his senior year. Joining him at North Dakota was fellow 1988 Canuck pick Dixon Ward, the first of four different stops where the two players would play together.\nJackson turned pro in 1992, and spent most of the next three seasons with the Canucks' AHL affiliates. He performed well in limited NHL action, scoring six goals in 13 games, but struggled to crack a deep Vancouver squad. He became a free agent in 1995 and signed with the Buffalo Sabres.\nIn 1995–96, Jackson had his longest NHL audition, registering 5 goals and 9 points in 22 games for the Sabres.

        "text": "The Parsis made their second tour of England in 1888. The fifteen member team played mostly against amateur teams and was more successful than the tourists of 1886.\nThe tour.\nThe second Parsi team played 31 matches, winning 8 and losing 11, a considerable improvement upon the performance of the 1886 team which won only one out of 28. As in the previous tour, none of the matches are deemed first class. The tour was arranged by Pestonji Kanga, D.C. Pandole and J.M. Divecha. The outstanding success of the tour was Mehellasha Pavri who some consider as the first great Indian cricketer. A fast round-arm bowler, he took 170 wickets at an average of 11.66. At Eastbourne, he is said to have sent a bail flying nearly 50 yards, and at Norfolk when he uprooted a stump, it flew nine yards and pitched itself the right way up. Cooper who scored 952 runs at 18.30 topped the run aggregate. The tour saw the first appearance of players like Dinshaw Writer and Nasarvanji Bapasola who were to earn prominence in the 1890s.\nAgainst the Gentlemen of Eastbourne, Parsis were made to follow-on and led by 122 in the second innings.

        "text": "Donald Antone Hahn (born November 16, 1948) is an American former professional baseball outfielder, known primarily for his defensive abilities. Hahn played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Montreal Expos, New York Mets, Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals, and San Diego Padres.\nHahn attended Campbell High School in Campbell, California. There, along with his studies, he played baseball, basketball, and football. The right-handed throwing and batting Hahn was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 17th round of the 1966 Major League Baseball draft\nOn April 8, 1969, Hahn played in his first major league game; he was the starting center fielder in the Montreal Expos' first game. He also was the first fielder in Expo franchise history to field a ball; in the bottom of the first inning, the New York Mets' Tommie Agee singled to center field, and Hahn retrieved it and threw the ball to the cutoff man. The game was played at Shea Stadium in Flushing, New York, and the Expos defeated the Mets by a score of 11-10. Hahn's first major league at-bat came in the second inning of the game as he batted eighth in the lineup; he struck out. He went 0-for-3 before being taken out for Don Shaw.\nHahn later became quite accustomed to the Shea Stadium outfield grass; a few days before the 1971 MLB season began, the Mets traded 1969 World Series hero Ron Swoboda, along with minor leaguer Rich Hacker, to the Expos, in exchange for the young outfielder.\nHahn emerged as the starting center fielder for the pennant-winning Mets of 1973. Hahn started all 12 games for the Mets during post-season play. Earlier in '73, in July, Hahn was involved in a brutal collision in the outfield with left fielder George Theodore, which resulted in a dislocated hip for Theodore.\nHahn was traded along with Tug McGraw and Dave Schneck from the Mets to the Philadelphia Phillies for Del Unser, John Stearns, and Mac Scarce at the Winter Meetings on December 3, 1974."

The school's team competes in the Horizon League and plays their home games at the Athletics Center O'rena. The Golden Grizzlies are coached by Greg Kampe. Kampe is the longest-tenured active Division I head coach. Oakland last played in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in 2024.\nThrough the 2022–23 season, Oakland has made a three-point field goal in 1,093 consecutive games, the fourth-longest active NCAA Division I streak. They last finished a game without a three-pointer on January 30, 1988.\nHistory.\nThe Oakland men's basketball program began competing in the 1967 season, 10 years after the university opened. Originally nicknamed the Pioneers, they won their first NCAA game 109–106 in overtime against Albion. The Pioneers were without a conference until 1974 when they joined the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (GLIAC).\nThe first year as members of the GLIAC, Oakland hired Greg Kampe, who is still the head coach at the university. Kampe had the fifth-longest tenure of all active Division I coaches, as of 2012. Oakland won two regular season GLIAC championships, in 1995–96 and 1996–97, their final two seasons in the league. In a 1993 game against Madonna, Oakland scored 91 points in the first half, on their way to a 189–107 victory. That game set school records for most points in a half (98) and largest margin of victory (82). The next three seasons, OU scored more than 100 points 30 times, winning 29 of those games.\nOakland played at the Division II level until 1997 when they changed their nickname to the Golden Grizzlies and began the transition to Division I. OU opened the Athletics Center O'rena in 1998 against Michigan State. When the O'rena was being built, home basketball games were played in the Sports Dome, an inflatable \"bubble\" used for practice by Oakland's athletic teams during the winter. The original basketball stadium was in the Hollie L. Lepley Sports Center.\nThe Golden Grizzlies completed the transition to Division I in 1999 and joined the Mid-Continent Conference (now known as The Summit League).\nThe Golden Grizzlies joined the Horizon League starting in the 2013–14 season.\nIn 2021, The Golden Grizzlies lose their 1,000 day streak of winning against Detroit Mercy.\nIn 2022, Oakland looks to build upon this game to challenge for its first Horizon League trophy since 2017.\nIn the 2023-24 season, the Golden Grizzlies won the Horizon League Tournament for the first time, securing an automatic bid to that season's NCAA Tournament. In the Round of 64, the 14th seeded Golden Grizzlies upset #3 Kentucky, 80-76, shocking the country and sending shockwaves throughout the tournament. Senior transfer Jack Gohlke caught the nation's eye with 10 three-pointers in the game, ending with 32 points. Kampe labelled it the \"biggest win of (his) career\" in post-game interviews.\nPostseason history.\nOakland competed in NCAA Division II since the inception of the basketball program in 1967 until they moved to NCAA Division I in 1997.

On January 31, Mitchell tied a career high in scoring two goals and adding an assist in a 6-3 victory over the Calgary Flames. Whilst short of team success, he showed his versatility in a checking and offensive role in scoring 10 goals and 20 points in 47 games.\nIn the following 2013–14 season, Mitchell scored his 100th career point in recording 2 assists in a 3-2 shootout victory over the Minnesota Wild on November 30, 2013.

        "text": "John Henderson Burnett (November 1, 1904 – August 12, 1959) was an American professional baseball player who appeared primarily as a shortstop in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1927 to 1935 for the Cleveland Indians and St. Louis Browns. Burnett holds the record for most hits in a single game in MLB history, with nine, albeit in extra innings.\nBiography.\nBorn in Bartow, Florida, Burnett made his major-league debut for the Cleveland Indians at the age of 22 on May 7, 1927, against the Philadelphia Athletics after graduating from the University of Florida. Burnett wore uniform number 1 in all eight of his seasons with the Indians. In 1930, Burnett's first season as an everyday starter, he was batting above .300 into July when, on July 19, he broke his wrist and was sidelined for the season. Without Burnett, the Indians finished eight games above .500.\nOn July 10, 1932, still playing for the Indians, Burnett set the major-league record for hits in a single game, compiling nine hits in 11 at-bats in an 18-inning game against the Philadelphia Athletics. Burnett's record for most hits in a game still stands. He was also the first player to have more than seven hits in a game that went into extra innings. Since then, only Rocky Colavito in 1962, Cesar Gutierrez in 1970, Rennie Stennett in 1975, and Brandon Crawford in 2016 have collected seven or more hits in single game.\nIn late 1934, in the waning years of his career, after eight seasons with the Indians, Burnett was traded to the St. Louis Browns for outfielder Bruce Campbell. Wearing number 4, Burnett played only one season for the Browns before being traded to the Cincinnati Reds near the start of the 1936 season for first baseman Jim Bottomley. Burnett never played a game for the Reds, his final major-league appearance having been on September 29, 1935.\nOverall during his major-league career, Burnett had a .284 average with nine home runs and 213 runs batted in (RBIs) in 558 MLB games. Defensively, he played 265 games at shortstop, while also making over 100 appearances at third base (133) and second base (103), along with three games in the outfield. As a shortstop, he had a .935 fielding percentage.\nBurnett finished his professional career playing three seasons in Minor League Baseball. He spent 1936 with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League, 1937 with three different teams (the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League, and two teams in the Texas League), and 1938 with the Columbia Reds of the South Atlantic League. He played at least 320 minor-league games, although records of the era are incomplete. In 1938 and 1939, he served as manager of the Columbia team.\nBurnett died in Tampa, Florida, on August 12, 1959, at the age of 54 from acute leukemia.\nNine-hit game.\nBurnett's nine hits came in 11 at bats on July 10, 1932, while batting second and playing shortstop, as listed below. He also scored four runs and had two RBIs, and defensively committed one error while recording five putouts and five assists. His team lost, as the Athletics defeated the Indians in 18 innings by a score of 18–17.\n Burnett's two-out RBI in the bottom of the ninth inning tied the game, 15–15, resulting in extra innings.\nExternal links.\n, or Baseball Almanac"

        "text": "The Boston College Eagles are a Division I college basketball program that represents Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, United States. The team has competed in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) since 2005, having previously played in the Big East. The Eagles have appeared in 18 NCAA Tournaments in their history, most recently in 2009. Home games have been played at the Conte Forum since 1988. The Eagles are currently coached by Earl Grant.\nHistory.\nIn 1904, the first men's varsity team was sanctioned at Boston College, and was coached by James Crowley. On December 26 of that year, BC played its first-ever game, losing 8–6 to Battery H of Navy. The team earned its first win that season against Tufts, 23–17, in Medford. Basketball, not a popular sport at the turn of the 20th century, suffered through years of weak fan support and lasted three initial seasons before being abandoned. A brief revival in the early 1920s brought the men's team back before being dropped again following the 1924–25 season. Finally, following World War II when the sport began to gain popularity in the United States, the basketball team became a permanent part of the Boston College athletics program for the 1945–46 season. Through 2021–22, there have been 84 seasons of BC basketball.\nIn 1963, BC hired Boston Celtics legend Bob Cousy as head coach and earned postseason berths in five of his six years in the role, including a trip to the Elite Eight in 1967. Boston College has hired several other notable coaches through the years, including Chuck Daly, Tom Davis, Gary Williams and former Eagle Jim O'Brien ('71).\nDuring one of the darkest periods in BC history, several members of the 1978–79 basketball team were accused of being involved in a point-shaving scandal that drew national attention due to the involvement of the infamous Mafia associate Henry Hill. One player, Rick Kuhn, was found guilty and served time in jail for his efforts in the fix.\nBefore the 1979–80 season, Boston College basketball became a charter member of the Big East Conference. With increased national exposure and better competition—leading to improved and more expansive recruiting—BC ensured itself of an opportunity to compete at the highest level of NCAA Division I basketball each year.\nFrom the time the seven original Northeastern schools formed the Big East, the BC men's basketball team achieved several high points: Advancing to the Elite Eight in the 1982 NCAA tournament; winning the Big East tournament in 1997 and 2001; four Big East Coach of the Year awards; three Big East Player of the Year awards and a memorable win over No. 1-ranked North Carolina in the 1994 NCAA tourney. Boston College left the Big East in all sports and joined the Atlantic Coast Conference after the 2004–05 season.\nAmong Boston College's biggest non-conference rivals in basketball is the University of Massachusetts. First played in 1905 and held annually since 1995, BC's basketball rivalry with UMass is called the \"Commonwealth Classic\" and was played on several occasions at what is now known as TD Garden in the 1990s until BC ended the annual game in 2012. The Eagles are 22–17 against their cross-state rival. The Boston College men's basketball team has made 18 overall appearances in the NCAA tournament, including three trips to the Elite Eight. The team has played in the NIT 10 times. BC has produced four conference players of the year:\nAdditionally, the Eagles have had one conference rookie of the year, with Olivier Hanlan earning the ACC Rookie of the Year honor in the 2012–13 season.\nNotable BC student-athletes who have gone on to careers in the NBA include: Michael Adams '85, John Bagley '83, Dana Barros '89, Troy Bell '03, Bill Curley '94, Howard Eisley '94, Jay Murphy '84, Gerry Ward '63, Sean Williams '07, Craig Smith '06, Jared Dudley '07, Reggie Jackson '11, Olivier Hanlan '16, and most recently Jerome Robinson '18 and Ky Bowman '19.\n1986–1997: O'Brien returns to the Heights.\nOn March 26, 1986, Jim O'Brien '71 returned to his alma mater as coach of the Boston College Eagles basketball team. Despite a bitter end to his tenure as head coach, O'Brien has been credited with resuscitating the BC basketball team, which—aside from some success in the early 1980s—had not been a consistent NCAA tournament contender since the 1960s. Although O'Brien built a solid program, his timing was excellent: Boston College opened its new hockey and basketball arena, Conte Forum, in 1988; the Big East reached its zenith with conference teams winning national championships in 1984 and 1985; and at the time, BC was still feeling the positive effects of the Flutie effect, leading to an increase in national exposure for Boston College athletics.\nBoston College played its final season in the Roberts Center in the 1987–88 season and were invited to the NIT, advancing to the semi-finals before being knocked off by regional rival UConn, 73–67. BC returned to the NIT in 1992 and 1993. In 1989–90, Israeli Lior Arditti led the team with an .823 free throw percentage and a .456 three-point field goal percentage.\nIn 1994, the Eagles were defeated by Georgetown 81–58 in the first round of the Big East tournament. But, following its invitation to the NCAA, the men's basketball team went on one of its most historic runs. Boston College defeated Washington State in the opening round of the tournament. In the second round, BC produced an upset of defending national champion North Carolina, 75–72, pushing them to the Sweet Sixteen. After a victory over Bobby Knight and Indiana, the Eagles advanced back to the Elite Eight where they fell to Florida, 74–66.\nIn 1996, the Eagles returned to the tournament. BC finished the year at 19–11 and bowed out in the second round after losing to Georgia Tech by a score of 103–89.\nLed by All-Big East forward Danya Abrams and sophomore point guard James \"Scoonie\" Penn, Boston College won the 1997 Big East tournament for the first time with victories over Pitt, Georgetown and Villanova. For its Big East tournament championship, BC received an automatic bid to the tournament and met Valparaiso. The Eagles knocked off its first-round opponent 73–66, but fell in the second round to St. Joseph's as the Hawks eked out an 81–77 win.\nAfter the 1997 season, controversy erupted as Jim O'Brien and the Boston College administration sparred over academic standards in recruiting athletes. O'Brien filed a lawsuit against BC on the grounds of breach of contract and slander. The case was settled out of court. Following a bitter end to his tenure, the BC alumnus moved to Ohio State and brought his star play-maker Scoonie Penn with him. At Ohio State, O'Brien took the Buckeyes to the Final Four in 1999. O'Brien's tenure at Ohio State also ended on bitter terms with litigation by O'Brien against his former employer.\n1997–2010: The Skinner era.\nEarly growth and success.\nFollowing the departure of Jim O'Brien in 1997, former Rhode Island head coach and ABA star Al Skinner arrived in Chestnut Hill as BC's first new head coach in over a decade. Following three sub-.500 seasons, Skinner led the Eagles to a Big East-best 27–5 mark in 2000–01 (setting a then-school record for wins in a season), the school's second Big East tournament title and a No. 3 seed in the NCAA tournament. BC defeated Southern Utah in the opening round but was upset by USC 74–71 in the second round. Skinner received Big East Coach of the Year honors and star sophomore Troy Bell was named Big East Co-Player of the Year.\nWith Skinner building on these early achievements, Boston College saw increased success on the basketball court and garnered growing national media attention in the decade that followed. The team received seven bids to the NCAA tournament in a ten-year span from 2000 to 2010. The Eagles made inroads in the newly joined ACC as well, advancing to the finals of the league tournament in the school's first year of membership in 2005–06 before falling to Duke by two points. The team returned to the ACC semifinal round in 2007.\nThe Eagles defeated the defending national champions in three consecutive seasons from the 2003–04 through the 2005–06 season: Syracuse 57–54 (on 2004-03-11), UConn 75–70 (on 2005-01-05) and UNC 81–74 (on 2006-01-25 and 2006-03-11).\nSkinner's success has been attributed to his ability to develop student-athletes not recruited by other major programs. Troy Bell, who won two Big East Player of the Year awards under Skinner, is seen as example, in addition to Jared Dudley, Sean Williams, Sean Marshall and All-American forward Craig Smith, a Los Angeles native who was overlooked by most Pac-10 schools.\nTwenty straight to start: 2004–05 Season.\nBeginning the season unranked and with no votes in the coaches' poll, the 2004-05 Boston College Eagles accomplished something no Big East team had done before by starting a season 20–0. In the 20 straight victories, the Eagles beat two ranked opponents and, at the time of the 20–0 mark, were one of only two teams without a loss (Illinois was the other).\nThe team finally lost occurred against Notre Dame on February 8, 2005. Following the defeat, BC beat unranked Rutgers and then No. 9 Syracuse on February 19, vaulting them to No. 3 in both the AP and coaches' polls—the highest ranking for any Boston College basketball team. After finishing the regular season at 24–3, BC was knocked out of the Big East tournament in the second round by West Virginia, 78–72, after drawing a bye in the first round with the league's best record (13–3). Boston College received a No. 4 seed in the 2005 NCAA tournament and defeated the Penn Quakers in the opening round, 85–65. In the following matchup against Milwaukee, who had already upset Alabama, UWM pulled another upset with an 83–75, ending the Eagles' season.\nBack to the Sweet Sixteen: 2005–06 Season.\nIn its debut ACC season, the Eagles recorded a school-record 28 wins, including 11 in conference. After reaching to the league tournament title game with victories over Maryland and North Carolina, the Eagles advanced to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time in 12 years and No. 7 in the final AP poll.\nIn May before the season began, a drug use incident involving center and BC single-season blocks leader Sean Williams led to his suspension for the first semester from the campus and the team. His playing status was in doubt until December. Although not allowed back to Chestnut Hill until the end of the first semester and contingent upon a court hearing, Williams took courses and worked out at the University of Houston in the fall. He was allowed to return after a Boston judge concluded he had fulfilled his commitment and the school gave its approval because Williams met his academic requirements. Sophomore forward Akida McLain was also suspended from the team for the first seven games of the season for an off-court incident.\nAlso prior to the season, senior forward Craig Smith was voted a first-team All-American, the first BC player to be so honored, and named to the All-ACC preseason team—before playing a game in the league. Boston College entered its first season in the ACC ranked No. 11 in both major polls and started 6–0, reaching as high as No. 6 on December 5. On December 11, McLain was reinstated and on December 22 Williams returned to the team against Harvard.\nAfter starting ACC play with three straight losses, the Eagles rebounded with four consecutive league wins—winning its first ACC game against Florida State on January 14. On February 13, BC defeated Stony Brook to reach the 20-win mark for the fifth time in six years. On February 25, Skinner earned his 169th Boston College win when the Eagles downed NC State 74–72 in double overtime, making the former ABA star the winningest coach in BC history. The Eagles finished the 2005–06 regular season with a 24–6 (11–5) record and defeated Maryland in the second round of the ACC tournament 80–66, after receiving an opening bye. BC then edged No. 10 North Carolina 85–82 and advanced to the ACC Championship Game in its first year in the league. No. 3 Duke defeated BC 78–76 win in the final.\nAs a No. 4 seed in the NCAA tournament BC defeated Pacific 88–76 in double overtime. After trailing by six in the first overtime, the Eagles rallied and went on a 14–2 run in the second session to win the game. Against 12th-seeded Montana, Boston College won 69–56, advancing to the regional semifinals for the first time since 1994. In the Sweet Sixteen against Villanova, BC lost 60–59 in overtime. The Eagles led by as many as 14 points in the first half but the Wildcats captured their first lead with 2:18 remaining in the game when Randy Foye hit two free throws to go ahead 49–48. With 28 seconds left, Jared Dudley sank a 3-pointer to tie the score and send the game to overtime. In the extra session, a Craig Smith basket gave BC a 59–58 lead. (It was later learned that Smith played the entire overtime period with a broken hand.) With seconds remaining, Wildcat forward Will Sheridan slipped past his defender and scored the winning two points on a goaltending call against Sean Williams with 2.3 seconds left. Louis Hinnant's three pointer missed at the buzzer and BC was eliminated.\nLater Skinner years: 2006–2010.\n2006–07 season.\nA senior-laden Boston College team enjoyed a winning 2006–2007 season but did not match the success of the year before. Jared Dudley led the Eagles to 4th in the ACC and a return to the ACC semifinal before losing to North Carolina. Boston College received a No. 7 seed in the NCAA tournament and defeated Texas Tech in the first round. The Eagles then faced Georgetown in the second round and were defeated. Following the season, Dudley and Marshall entered the NBA, leaving Tyrese Rice to lead the 2007–2008 Eagles.\n2007–08 season.\nThe Eagles struggled in 2007–2008 going 14–17 and 4–12 in conference play. BC, however, got 3 highly regarded freshmen in Rakim Sanders, Josh Southern, and Corey Raji. Rice had many impressive performances such as his 48-point performance against North Carolina that ended up in a 90–80 loss. BC had trouble finishing off teams and going into 2008–2009 had 1 senior, 1 junior, and the rest freshmen and sophomores.\n2008–09 season.\nBC had a solid 8–2 start to the 2008–2009 season with the addition of Vermont transfer forward Joe Trapani. BC went 3–1 in the NIT tip-off, losing only to a tough Purdue team 71–64 and coming in 3rd in the whole tournament.\nTo start the 2008–09 ACC Season, the Eagles stunned the then-undefeated #1-ranked North Carolina Tar Heels in the Dean Dome 85–78, behind great play by Rice, Rakim Sanders, and freshman Reggie Jackson. Despite the enormity of the win and the national attention that came with it, the Eagles promptly lost at home to Harvard 82–70 in the following game. In all, they suffered 4 consecutive losses after the North Carolina victory including Miami, Wake Forest, and Virginia Tech. The slump ended with a win in overtime against Georgia Tech. BC then got 3 more key ACC wins against NC State, Maryland, and Virginia Tech. In the Virginia Tech game, BC won in exciting fashion via a put-back shot with less than a second remaining. That made BC 5–3 in the ACC and 17–6 overall. After a win at Virginia, the Eagles were just a half game out of first place in the conference. The Eagles went on a two-game losing streak, after losing halftime leads against No. 7 Wake Forest and No. 11 Clemson. In a home game on February 15 Boston College Defeated #6 Duke with a score of 80–74. Tyrese Rice scored 21 points, including his 2,000th career point at BC. It was the Eagles' first win over the Blue Devils in 24 years, and BC was the only team to beat both Duke and UNC that season. After the victory against Duke, the Eagles lost their next game to Miami (Fla.) for the second time in the same year. After this setback, BC went 2–1 down the stretch with home victories over #25 Florida State and a Rakim Sanders buzzer beater over Georgia Tech. They finished the regular season 21–10 and sixth in the ACC. In the first round of the conference tournament the Eagles beat Virginia 76–63 and moved on to play #8 Duke in the second round. BC lost to the Blue Devils 66–65 and were eliminated from the tournament. The Eagles finished the season 22–11 (9–7). Senior Tyrese Rice was named to the 2nd team All-ACC after being on the 1st team All-ACC the previous year.\nBC received a #7 seed and a date with a USC team led by future first-round draft pick Taj Gibson on March 20, 2009. However, that was the last game Tyrese Rice ever played in a BC uniform. The Eagles led by 4 at the half, but ultimately lost 72–55. Although the team lost Rice to graduation, all other players would return for the 2009–10 season.\n2009–10 season.\nThe Eagles had a disappointing 2009–2010 season, finishing 15–16 (6–10 in the ACC). The team's most notable games were losses to struggling programs, including Maine, Saint Joseph's, and (for the second straight year) Harvard. They ended the season with a loss to Virginia in the ACC Tournament, bringing the Eagles' all-time record in the tournament to .500 (5–5).\nOn March 30, 2010, head coach Al Skinner was fired and soon replaced by former Cornell coach Steve Donahue, who had just completed guiding the Big Red to the Sweet Sixteen and the Ivy League's best performance in the tournament since 1979.\nWith the loss of Skinner, Boston College junior forward Rakim Sanders decided to transfer, landing at Fairfield where former BC Assistant Ed Cooley was head coach. Recruits Brady Heslip and Kevin Noreen also asked to be released from their letters of intent and never matriculated at BC. The team's lone senior, Tyler Roche, graduated after the 2009–2010 season.\n2010–2014: Donahue's tenure.\n2010–11 season.\nIn Steve Donahue's first season as head coach, the Eagles roster featured seven seniors but was led by star junior guard Reggie Jackson, who was named to the first team All-ACC. BC finished the regular season at 19–11, 9–7 in the ACC. That conference record earned them a 5-seed in the ACC tournament, where they beat 12-seeded Wake Forest. However, they lost a tough game to 4-seed Clemson. Boston College was one of multiple ACC teams on the NCAA tournament bubble. They received a 1 seed in the NIT. They won in the first round against McNeese State. However, they lost by double figures to 4-seed Northwestern. Their final record was 20–12. The season was highlighted by a marquee win over Texas A&amp;M, and sweeps of Maryland and Virginia Tech. On the other hand, the team lost to Yale and Harvard at home; it was the third straight year that the Eagles lost to the Crimson, despite Harvard losing its star guard, Jeremy Lin, to graduation the previous year.\n2011–12 Season.\nSteve Donahue's second season was a rough one. BC lost star Reggie Jackson to the NBA draft, and also lost key players Biko Paris, Corey Raji, Joe Trapani, and Josh Southern to graduation. They also lost reserve Dallas Elmore to transfer. The only player with major experience, Matt Humphrey, was a transfer from the University of Oregon. With a roster featuring 9 freshman, the Eagles were picked last in the ACC. Early on, guard Patrick Heckmann carried the team through their first games of the season, but mono and injury issues caused a significant drop in production for Heckmann. The team struggled mightily early on, going 5–10 in non-conference and getting blown out against teams like UMass and Holy Cross. In the Eagles' first ACC game at North Carolina they kept things close, cutting the UNC lead to 9 late in the second half. Momentum from that performance carried over when they won two straight ACC games at home, against Clemson and Virginia Tech. However, the Eagles lost their next 6 games. BC struggled the rest of the season as well, but did show flashes of the future in stunning #15 Florida State and beating Georgia Tech, as well. Their season ended in a loss in the ACC Tournament to NC State. BC finished 9–22, 4–12 in the ACC. The Eagles were paced by freshman Ryan Anderson, who averaged 11.8 PPG and 7.4 RPG on his way to making the All-ACC Freshman team.\n2012–13 Season.\nIn Steve Donahue's 3rd season, the underclassmen-heavy Eagles finished 16–17 (8–10). The team was led by freshman guard Olivier Hanlan (15.4 PPG) and sophomore forward Ryan Anderson (14.9 PPG). The Eagles were picked last for the second consecutive preseason poll but finished 8th in ACC play. In the non-conference the Eagles finished 8–5, including losses to Charleston, Bryant, and Harvard. However, the Eagles defeated major conference opponents Auburn and Providence. The Eagles began ACC play with a 1–6 record and several narrow defeats. BC lost 60–59 to eventual ACC champion Miami (FL) and lost 78–73 to #23 NC State. However, the Eagles improved in the second half of conference play, going 6–5 to end the year. During those games, BC narrowly lost to #4 Duke, 62–61. After beating Georgia Tech in the regular season finale, the Eagles again topped the Yellow Jackets 84–64 in the ACC Tournament's opening round. In the game, Hanlan scored a freshman record 41 points. In the second round, the Eagles' season ended with a loss to #9 Miami (FL), 69–58. Olivier Hanlan was named ACC freshman of the year.\n2013–14 Season.\nAfter a lackluster 8–24 season (4–14 ACC) and despite an upset victory over then–undefeated #1 Syracuse, coach Steve Donahue was fired as Boston College head coach on March 18, 2014. Jim Christian, formerly head coach of the Ohio Bobcats was hired to fill the vacancy.\n2014–2021: Jim Christian Takes Over.\n2014–15 Season.\nIn Jim Christian's first season at the helm, the Eagles finished with a 13–19 record, 4–14 in ACC play. After a second round exit from the ACC tournament, star point guard Olivier Hanlan declared for the 2015 NBA draft as a junior. He was selected 42nd overall in the 2nd round by the Utah Jazz.\n2015–16 Season.\nJim Christian's second season as head coach saw the Eagles fall on hard times, finishing with an overall record of 7–25, and 0–18 in ACC play. This marked the first time a team did not win a single in-conference game in ACC basketball history, and complimented the football team's 0–8 record in ACC play.\n2016–17 Season.\nThe Eagles righted their course slightly after the '15–'16 season, as they finished the season with a 2–16 record in ACC play and 9–23 overall record. The '16–'17 season was highlighted by play from stand-out freshman Ky Bowman.\n2017–18 Season.\nBoston College continued their upward trend in the '17–'18 season, finishing 7–11 in ACC play and with an overall record of 19–16. This was their first winning basketball record since the 2010–2011 season. During the '17–'18 season Eagles beat #1 Duke Blue Devils at home on December 9, 2017, to open ACC play. Before this, their last win over Duke was in the 2008–09 season, beating them 80–74 at home. The Eagles also gave the eventual #1 Virginia a scare on the road, yet missed the final shot of the game to fall 58–59. In the ACC tournament, Boston College won two games, first beating Georgia Tech, and then upsetting 5th ranked NC State before falling to #4 Clemson in the quarterfinals. Junior forward Jerome Robinson had a career year, averaging 20.8 points, good for second in the ACC behind Duke's Marvin Bagley III. Robinson finished second in voting for ACC player of the year, also behind Bagley III, and was eventually named an All-American Honorable Mention. After the season ended, Jerome Robinson declared for the 2018 NBA draft, and was selected 13th overall by the Los Angeles Clippers.\n2020–21 Season.\nOn February 15, 2021, Boston College announced that it had fired head coach Jim Christian, effective immediately. The Eagles were 3–13 on the season at that time. Boston College announced that assistant coach Scott Spinelli would take over as interim head coach for the remainder of the season. The Eagles finished the season 4–16.\n2021–present: Earl Grant Era.\n2021–22 Season.\nOn March 15, 2021, Boston College officially hired Earl Grant, formerly head coach at the College of Charleston, to replace interim head coach Scott Spinelli. As a result of the staffing change and the loss of scoring leaders Jay Heath and CJ Felder to the transfer portal, Boston College was picked last in the ACC preseason poll. After starting the season with a 5–3 record, the Eagles defeated Notre Dame 73–57 at home in their ACC opener, with James Karnik scoring a team high 17 points and 13 rebounds. Following a five-game losing streak, Boston College completed a 23-point comeback victory against the Clemson Tigers, led by a second half performance from Makai Ashton-Langford, who scored 17 of his 19 points after the intermission. The Eagles ended the regular-season ranked 13th in the ACC with a conference record of 6–14. After beating #12 Pitt in the first round of the ACC tournament, the Eagles upset #5 Wake Forest in a 82–77 overtime victory, making it only the second time a team ranked 13th had reached the quarterfinals in the ACC tournament and the first time that the Eagles had won two games in the tournament since the 2018 season. The Eagles then lost to #4 Miami in a back-and-forth game that ended with a last-second lay-up to give Miami a 71–69 lead in overtime. Boston College ended the season with an overall record of 13–20.\nPostseason results.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Eagles have appeared in the NCAA tournament 18 times.

        "title": "Oral Roberts Golden Eagles men's basketball",
        "text": "The Oral Roberts Golden Eagles men's basketball team is the basketball team representing Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The team is a member of Summit League.\nOral Roberts has made appearances in seven NCAA Tournaments, the most recent appearance in 2023. The team has also appeared in eight National Invitation Tournaments, one College Basketball Invitational, and two CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournaments. The Golden Eagles have won seven regular season conference championships and six tournament championships. The team has been members of the Southland Conference and the Midwestern Collegiate Conference.\nIn the opening round of the 2021 tournament, the Golden Eagles recorded just the ninth 15 vs. 2 upset in tournament history, defeating Ohio State 75–72 in overtime, in the process winning their first tournament game since 1974. Two days later, they became just the second 15 seed (after the 2013 Florida Gulf Coast Eagles) to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, after defeating #7 Florida 81–78.\nOn April 10, 2017, the school fired all-time winningest coach Scott Sutton after 18 years. He finished with an overall record of 328–247. The school named Paul Mills as the new head coach on April 28.\nPrior to the 1993–94 season, ORU was known as the Titans. The Golden Eagles and Tulsa Golden Hurricane exchange a traveling trophy, the Mayor's Cup, in the two teams' crosstown rivalry.\nPostseason play.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Golden Eagles have appeared in seven NCAA tournaments. Their combined record is 4–7.\n1974 NCAA Tournament.\nORU, in just its eighth season of varsity competition, made the big show and almost stole the show, coming within three points of advancing to the Final Four. The Titans finished the regular season 21–5 before receiving the NCAA bid and then proceeded to knock off Syracuse 86–82 in overtime in the sub-Regional in Denton, Texas in the first round and Louisville 96–93 at the Mabee Center to move on to the Elite Eight. ORU's dream season came to an end on its home floor, however, as Kansas overcame a nine-point deficit in the game's final minutes to send it to overtime, where the Jayhawks won 93–90. ORU, at 23–6, won 20-plus games for the fifth straight season, closing out Ken Trickey's five-year coaching stay with an incredible 118–23 record. ORU averaged 94.6 points, the fifth straight season over the 90-point mark under Trickey, whose running style helped revolutionize offensive basketball from then on. Junior guard Sam McCants paced the Titans with a 24.0 scoring average, while senior forward Eddie Woods completed a standout four-year career by leading the team with a 12.1 rebounding average. The Titans finished 18th in the final Associated Press ranking, the second time in three years placing in the Top Twenty.\n1984 NCAA Tournament.\nVisions of the final-eight Titans of ten years earlier danced in the heads of the 1983–84 Titans as ORU advanced to the NCAA Tournament after winning the Midwestern Collegiate Conference postseason party with a 68–66 decision over Xavier. The Titans had won the regular season conference title with an 11–3 record and then took all three games in the MCC tourney to gain the right to play Memphis State in Memphis, Tenn., in first-round NCAA play. ORU, behind junior center Mark Acres' 28 points, gave Memphis State all it could handle but eventually bowed in defeat 92–83 to the homestanding Tigers. Acres, the MCC Player of the Year, was on his way to his third straight All-American season in which he would finish with team leading averages of 20.8 points and 10.5 rebounds. He was not alone during ORU's march to the NCAA Tournament, receiving support from junior teammates Sam Potter (18.1 ppg) and Jeff Acres (15.0), his older brother who bounced back from a redshirt season to play a key role in the Titans' resurgence. ORU, which opened the season with a 4–5 start, turned things around the rest of the way, posting a 17–4 record on its way to the MCC crown.\n2006 NCAA Tournament.\nOne year after coming so close to reaching their first NCAA Tournament in over 20 years, the Golden Eagles finally advanced to the Big Dance. Plagued by injuries to key players throughout the season, the Golden Eagles rallied down the regular-season's home stretch, tying IUPUI for the Mid-Continent Conference regular season title on the final day. ORU again earned the No. 1 seed for the Mid-Con Tournament and this time, there was no miracle, last-second shot in the title game. ORU romped by Chicago State, 85–72, in the title game in Tulsa, earning the school's first NCAA Tournament berth in 22 years. Junior guard Ken Tutt, who earlier missed 10 conference games with a broken foot, earned Tournament MVP honors. Despite being a 16 seed for the NCAA Tournament, the Golden Eagles were much-ballyhooed in the days leading up to their meeting with No. 1 seed Memphis, with some so-called \"experts\" labeling the Golden Eagles as the best No. 16 seed ever. ORU gave the Tigers a good tussle, but eventually came up short in Dallas. Junior forward Caleb Green once again enjoyed a tremendous season, claiming his second straight Mid-Con Player of the Year honor, and once again earning honorable mention All-America honors from the AP. The Golden Eagles enjoyed significant nationwide exposure, playing on national television three different times, including a 68–48 win over Southern Cal on ESPN2 while at the Great Alaska Shootout. The Golden Eagles kept the Mayor's Cup at the Mabee Center for the third straight season with a 62–48 defeat of Tulsa.\n2007 NCAA Tournament.\nWith seniors Green and Tutt leading the way, the Golden Eagles made history by becoming the first ORU team to reach consecutive NCAA Tournaments. Green, who became the Mid-Continent Conference's all-time leader in points and rebounds, earned conference player of the year for the third time and captured Mid-Con Tournament MVP honors. But it was Tutt's clutch shooting which carried the Golden Eagles to the tournament title. Tutt banked in a running jumper with 31 seconds remaining to give ORU a come-from behind victory over Oakland and a second straight NCAA Tournament berth. The basket not only gave ORU a title, but also put Tutt at 2,000 career points, making him and Green just the seventh duo in NCAA history to reach 2,000 together. But it was not just post-season success which the Golden Eagles enjoyed. On November 15, ORU enjoyed the biggest regular-season victory in school history with a shocking 78–71 win at No. 3 Kansas. , who later won Mid-Con Sixth Man of the Year honors, scored a career-high 22 points off the bench, hitting seven consecutive three-pointers during the game.\n2008 NCAA Tournament.\nWith the loss of 2,000-point scorers Caleb Green and Ken Tutt, it seemed unlikely for the Golden Eagles to repeat as Summit League champions for the fourth consecutive year. However, a foursome of unheralded seniors and a high-scoring newcomer helped propel ORU to the unlikeliest of championship seasons. Seniors Moses Ehambe, Shawn King, Adam Liberty and Yemi Ogunoye guided ORU to a 24–9 overall record and a 16–2 conference record, which included a record 13–0 start. The best defense in school history propelled the Golden Eagles to regular season wins over Tulsa and Oklahoma State. Head coach Scott Sutton was named Summit League Coach of the Year. Junior guard Robert Jarvis sparked ORU's offense off the bench, leading the nation's reserves in scoring at 16.1 points per game on his way to Summit League Sixth Man of the Year. Ogunoye, a defensive stalwart for five seasons, earned Summit League Defensive Player of the Year, and Ehambe, on the strength of a record eight three-pointers in the opening round and 25 points in the championship game, earned Summit League tournament MVP honors.\n2021 NCAA Tournament.\nSeeded fourth in the Summit League tournament, the Golden Eagles topped North Dakota before nabbing upset wins over top-seeded South Dakota State and North Dakota State in the respective semifinal and championship rounds. A crucial block and steal by Francis Lacis with two seconds remaining in the latter game allowed the Golden Eagles to escape with a 75–72 victory and reach their first NCAA men's basketball tournament in 13 years. Placed in a No. 15 seed in the South region, ORU went on to pull off a shocking upset of the No. 2 seed and Big Ten runner-up Ohio State Buckeyes in a 75–72 overtime triumph. Kevin Obanor and Max Abmas combined for 59 points in the victory. The Golden Eagles beat the Florida Gators 81–78 to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, becoming just the second No. 15 seed to advance to the regional semifinal round (and first since Florida Gulf Coast in 2013). But against the Arkansas Razorbacks, they fell by a 72–70 final which caused their run to end.\nNIT results.\nThe Golden Eagles have appeared in eight National Invitation Tournaments (NIT). Their combined record is 2–8.\n1972 NIT.\nORU's first postseason team ever, the 1971–72 edition of the 'run-and-gun' Titans featured: guard Richard Fuqua, who would finish second in the nation among small-college players in scoring with a 35.9 average; forward Eddie Woods, who averaged 14.5 rebounds per game, still an ORU single-season high; forward Sam McCamey, ORU's first draftee when he was selected in the eighth round of the 1972 draft by Boston; and guard Eldon Lawyer, Fuqua's running mate. The team won four straight games to open the season before losing at Murray State 94–87 on Dec. 18. ORU then reeled off a school record 22 wins in a row, the last being a 94–74 drubbing of Memphis State at Madison Square Garden in the opening round of the NIT. ORU's season and win streak came to an end three nights later when the Titans lost to St. John's 94–78. The 1971–72 team, which topped the century mark in scoring 20 times in 28 games, led the nation offensively with a 105.1 points per game average and in rebounding at 60.2 boards per game. ORU finished 16th in the final Associated Press ranking.\n1973 NIT.\nMaking a second consecutive appearance in the NIT, the 1972–73 ORU Titans posted a final record of 21–6, marking the fourth straight 20–win season for the university. Headlining the 1972–73 edition was senior guard Richard Fuqua, who led the team for the fourth straight year in scoring with a 23.5 average. Sophomore center David Vaughn steered the team with Fuqua. He posted averages of 19.2 points and 14.3 rebounds to earn All-American honors along with Fuqua. Both players were drafted following the season, with Fuqua going to Boston and Vaughn to Virginia in the ABA. For the second consecutive year, ORU led the nation in scoring, averaging 97.3 points per outing, while scoring 100 or more points in a contest 11 times. The Titans also ranked first nationally in field-goal attempts per game (98.5) and in rebound margin (+15.3). The 1972–73 team average of 65.9 rebounds per game still stands as a school record. The 1972–73 season did mark the end of ORU's school-record 52-game home winning streak when Marshall defeated the Titans 106–103 on Feb. 10 in the Homecoming game. The streak had dated back to Feb. 17, 1969, when the Titans played in the old Dome on campus. ORU's appearance in the NIT came to an abrupt 82–65 end at the hands of North Carolina at the Garden.\n1975 NIT.\nThe Titans did not skip a beat under new head coach Jerry Hale, posting a 20–8 record and advancing to postseason play for the fourth straight year. The team's appearance in the NIT at Madison Square Garden marked the third time in four seasons in the postseason classic for the Titans, who nipped Memphis State 97–95 in the first round before losing a hard-fought battle to Oregon 68–59 four nights later. Sophomore forward Anthony Roberts blossomed into an offensive force and gave an extended glimpse of things to come by averaging 22.4 points per game to lead the team. Roberts had averaged just 5.2 points per outing in limited action the year before. He was followed closely by fellow sophomore Arnold Dugger, who averaged 17.1 points in his first season with the Titans after coming to ORU with Hale from the junior college level. Roberts and Dugger would each earn All-American honors at the end of the season, with Roberts being named to the Independent First Team squad. The team's 20–8 record marked the sixth consecutive 20-plus win campaign and included wins over Texas A&amp;M, Jacksonville and Southern Illinois.\n1977 NIT.\nORU returned to the NIT for the fourth time in six years on the strength of a 21–6 regular season record. Unfortunately, the team's appearance in the NIT was short-lived as Oregon spoiled a record-setting performance by senior forward Anthony 'Woosie' Roberts in a thrilling 90–89 win over the Titans at the Mabee Center. Roberts, who completed the season as the nation's second-leading scorer with a 34.0 average, blistered the Ducks for 65 points in the NIT loss, setting a single-game tournament high that still stands today. Woosie, who also averaged 9.2 rebounds while shooting 54.4 percent, earned consensus All-American honors for his senior-season heroics. Joining Roberts to form ORU's Titan-ic trio were senior guard Arnold Dugger and senior forward Alvin Scott. Dugger concluded the season with 501 career assists and still holds the record while accomplishing the feat in just three seasons. Scott swatted away a team-leading 81 shots and led the team in rebounding with a 9.5 average. His season block total is an ORU record. Roberts, Dugger and Scott were all drafted in 1977, with Roberts going in the first round to Denver. Scott, picked by Phoenix in the seventh round, enjoyed a long career with the Suns.\n1982 NIT.\nFive years to the day of the 1977 Titans' 90–89 loss to Oregon, ORU was back in the NIT, hosting state rival Oklahoma at the Mabee\nCenter. The Sooners put a damper on the anniversary festivities with an 81–73 victory, spoiling the Titans' fifth appearance overall in the NIT. ORU, coming off an 11–16 season in 1980–81, relied on the contributions of both young and old throughout the campaign. Freshman center Mark Acres became just the third first-year player to lead the team in scoring, joining Dana Lewis in 1967–68 and Richard Fuqua in 1969–70, by averaging 14.6 points per game. Acres also paced the Titans in rebounding with an 8.1 average. Senior guard Gary 'Cat' Johnson finished second behind Acres with a 14.2 scoring mark and sophomore forward Lester Gill placed third with 12.2 ppg. Acres earned AP honorable mention All-American accolades for his efforts. The Titans, in their third season under head coach Ken Hayes, opened the season 7–3 and used that momentum to overcome injuries and a tough conference slate to qualify for the NIT berth.\n1997 NIT.\nOral Roberts advanced to Division I postseason play for the first time since 1983–84 and the first time as the Golden Eagles. With the leadership of four seniors and the impressive play of junior sensation shooting guard Tim Gill, Head Coach Bill Self led his team to a postseason berth for the first time under his direction in the fourth and last season of his tenure as head coach. ORU's final regular season record was 21–6, and this was the Golden Eagles' final year as an independent. Victories over such teams as No. 16 Arkansas, nationally ranked Tulsa and established Oklahoma State were not enough to give ORU an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament, but the National Invitation Tournament did extend a bid. The Eagles gladly accepted and headed up to South Bend, Indiana, to face Notre Dame and Big East player of the year Pat Garrity on March 12, 1997. ORU went into the game with wins in 12 of its last 13 games, but whatever the reason, the Golden Eagles did not show up to play against the Fighting Irish. Notre Dame only led by six at the half (35–29), but extended its lead to as many as 18 points in the second period (74–56 at 0:15) and ended up winning by 16, 74–58. Gill still led all scorers in the contest with 21 points.\n2005 NIT.\nA much-anticipated season culminated with a post-season tournament berth, though it was not the tournament the Golden Eagles\nhad hoped for. Following a 23-win regular season, a Mid-Continent Conference regular season title and a pair of wins in the Mid-Con Tournament, the Golden Eagles were stunned in the Mid-Con finals by Oakland, losing 61–60 at John Q. Hammons Arena in Tulsa. The Golden Eagles accepted a bid to the NIT—their first post-season berth in eight years—and lost 85–72 at Maryland in a nationally televised first-round game. Caleb Green enjoyed a monster sophomore season, earning Mid-Con Player of the Year honors and also capturing Associated Press All-America (HM) honors, the first ORU All-American in over 20 years. Head coach Scott Sutton was honored as the NABC District 12 co-Coach of the Year, sharing the honor with his father, Oklahoma State's Eddie Sutton. ORU picked up several impressive wins, most notably a defeat of Georgetown in the Hawaii Rainbow Classic, and an ESPN Bracket Buster win at Southwest Missouri State. The Golden Eagles handed Tulsa a record-setting 70–47 defeat in the annual Mayor's Cup game.\n2012 NIT.\nThe Golden Eagles went 17–1 in The Summit League to be regular season champions but failed to win the Summit League Basketball tournament. As regular season conference champions, they received an automatic bid into the NIT. They lost to WAC regular season champion Nevada in the first round to finish the season 27–7.\nCBI results.\nThe Golden Eagles have appeared in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) one time. Their record is 1–1.\nCIT results.\nThe Golden Eagles have appeared in two CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournaments (CIT). Their combined record is 2–2.\nNotable players.\nRetired numbers.\nThe Golden Eagles have retired three numbers in program history.\nMabee Center.\nThe Mabee Center has been home to the Golden Eagles since 1972. The arena bears the name of John and Lottie Mabee, who established the Tulsa-based Mabee Foundation in 1948. The benevolences of this foundation are evident throughout the Southwest where many edifices bear the name. Mabee Center was built as an elliptical cable-suspension structure with basketball in mind. The arena has 10,575 permanent theater seats - with no obstacles to clear viewing. Recently, four luxury suites were added on the south side or directly behind the team benches. The arena has drawn nine different national tournaments since the building opened. The Golden Eagles themselves played in the first NCAA tournament held here in 1974. Four other NCAA regionals (1975, 1978, 1982 and 1985) have been based at the Mabee Center. The National Invitation Tournament picked ORU as host four times (1977, 1980, 1982 and 1983). Mabee Center also annually hosts the Oklahoma state high school playoffs and the Oklahoma Coaches Association All-Star games. It was also the former site of the NAIA National Basketball Championship. Mabee Center regularly plays host to various conventions, conferences, seminars, and special events such as the annual Miss Oklahoma pageant. In the past, Mabee Center has hosted performers including Elvis Presley, Garth Brooks, Willie Nelson, Reba McEntire and Blue Man Group."

        "text": "Snooker is a cue sport that is played on a baize-covered snooker table with pockets in each of the four corners and in the middle of each of the long side cushions. It is played using a cue and snooker balls: one white , 15 worth one point each (the game is sometimes played with fewer red balls, commonly 6 or 10), and six balls of different : yellow (2 points), green (3), brown (4), blue (5), pink (6), black (7). A player (or team) wins a (individual game) of snooker by scoring more points than the opponent(s), using the cue ball to the red and coloured . A player (or team) wins a match when they have achieved the best-of score from a pre-determined number of frames. The number of frames is always odd so as to prevent a tie or a draw.\nThe table.\nSnooker is played on a rectangular snooker table with six pockets, one at each corner and one in the middle of each long side. The table usually has a slate base, covered in green baize. A is drawn across the width of the table, from the cushion at one end; these two latter items are respectively designated as the and . A semicircle of radius , called , is drawn behind this line, with its centre on the midpoint. The cushion at the other end of the table is known as the .\nA regulation (full-size) table is ; because of the large size of these tables, smaller tables are common in homes, pubs and other places where space is limited. These are often around in length, with all the dimensions and markings scaled down accordingly. The balls used are sometimes also scaled down, and/or reduced in number (in the case of the reds) by omitting the longest row of balls in the rack.\nThe balls.\nSnooker balls, like Billiard balls, are typically made of phenolic resin, and are smaller than American pool balls. Regulation snooker balls (which are specified in metric units) are nominally 52.5 mm (approximately  inches) in diameter, though many sets are actually manufactured at 52.4 mm (about  in). No weight for the balls is specified in the rules, only that the weight of any two balls should not differ by more than 0.5 g. Some recreational sets (which are usually not measured metrically) are  in (about 54 mm) up to as large as pool balls, at  in (about 57.2 mm); larger ball size requires wider pocket openings. Miniature sets also exist, for half-size home tables. There are fifteen , six (yellow, green, brown, blue, pink, and black), and one white . Usually none of the balls are numbered, though the six colour balls often are in the US, where they are easily mistaken at first glance for pool balls (the design is similar, but the numbering does not match pool's scheme).\nAt the beginning of a frame, the balls are set up in the arrangement shown in the illustration. The six (a term referring to all balls except the white and the reds) are placed on their own spots. On the baulk line, looking up the table from the baulk end, the green ball is located where the \"D\" meets the line on the left, the brown ball in the middle of the line, and the yellow ball where the \"D\" meets the line on the right. This order is often remembered using the mnemonic \"God Bless You\", the first letter of each word being the first letter of the three colours (Green, Brown, Yellow). The blue ball rests at the exact centre of the table, while the pink is placed midway between it and the top cushion. The red balls are arranged in a tightly-packed triangle behind the pink, with the apex as close as possible to the pink but not touching it. Finally, the black ball is placed on a spot from the top cushion, centred from left to right so that the brown, blue, pink, and black balls all sit on an imaginary line that bisects the table along its length.\nObjective.\nThe objective of the game of snooker is to strike the white with a cue so that it strikes the in turn and causes them to fall into one of the six pockets, called . Points are scored for potting balls legally, in accordance with the rules described below, or in the event of a foul committed by the opponent. The player who scores more points wins the frame, and the first player to win a set number of frames wins the match.\nMatch.\nA match usually consists of a fixed, odd number of frames. A frame begins with setting up the balls as described above. A frame ends when all balls are potted, or when one of the players concedes defeat due to being too far behind on points to tie or beat the opponent's score.\nA match ends when one player has won enough frames to make it impossible for the other player to catch up. For example, in a match of 19 frames, the first player to win 10 is the victor.\nIn most versions of snooker, there is no specified time limit for a player to take a shot. However, the referee may issue a warning at his/her discretion, then award the frame to the opponent if the player takes too long to act. Other versions do set a time limit for each shot, such as 60 seconds, and impose a foul if the limit is violated.\nGameplay.\nAt the beginning of each frame, the balls are set up by the referee as explained. The frame begins with one player taking the cue ball , placing it anywhere on or inside the D and attempting to hit one or more of the red balls on an initial shot. A common strategy for this shot involves placing the cue ball on the baulk line, between the brown ball and either the green or yellow ball. The break-off alternates between players on successive frames.\nOnly one player may visit the table at a time. A is the number of points scored in a single visit to the table. A player's turn and break end when they commit a foul, fail to pot a ball, or when a frame is complete.\nThe ball(s) that can be hit first by the cue ball are referred to as being for that particular stroke. The ball(s) \"on\" differ from shot to shot; if any reds are on the table, all of them are \"on\" for the first stroke of a player's turn. Potting a red allows the player to nominate one colour as \"on\" for the next shot and attempt to pot it. The alternation between reds and colours continues until a player either ends their turn by missing or committing a foul, or pots the last red and attempts (successfully or not) to pot a colour after it. All of the reds are \"on\" for the break-off shot.\nEach frame of snooker generally consists of two phases. The first phase lasts as long as any red balls remain on the table. During this phase, all red balls are \"on\" for the beginning of a player's turn; the player must therefore first hit and attempt to pot one or more of them. If the player either commits a foul or fails to pot a red, the turn ends and the opponent begins to play.\nEach legally potted red ball awards one point and remains off the table until the end of the frame. The player continues their turn by nominating one of the six colours (yellow, green, brown, blue, pink, black) as the ball \"on\" for the next shot. The rules of the game indicate that the player must state the desired colour to the referee, although it is usually clear which ball the player is attempting to pot, making a formal nomination unnecessary unless the referee insists on it.\nPotting the nominated colour awards further points (two through seven, in the same order as the preceding paragraph). The referee then removes the colour from the pocket and replaces it on the table in its original spot. If that spot is occupied (that is, if the ball cannot be placed on it without touching another ball), then the ball is placed on the highest available spot. If all spots are occupied, it is placed as close to its own spot as possible in a direct line between that spot and the top cushion, without touching another ball. If there is no room this side of the spot, it will be placed as close to the spot as possible in a straight line towards the bottom cushion, without touching another ball. The player then resumes play, with the red balls \"on\" again.\nThe alternation between red balls and colours ends when all reds have been potted and an attempt (successful or not) to pot a colour is made after the last red is potted, or when the last red is potted or knocked off the table as the result of a foul and is not replaced. All six colours have then to be potted in ascending order of their value (yellow, green, brown, blue, pink, black). Each becomes the ball \"on\" in that order. During this phase, the colours are not replaced on the table after being legally potted; however, any colour potted as the result of a foul is re-spotted.\nAfter all six colours have been potted, the player with the higher score wins the frame (but see below for end-of-frame scenarios).\nBecause only one of the colours can be \"on\" at any given time, it is a foul to first hit multiple colours at the same time, or pot more than one colour (unless a has been awarded .\nTouching ball.\nIf the cue ball comes to rest in direct contact with a ball that is on or could be on, the referee shall declare a \"\". The striker must \"play away\" from that ball without moving it, but is not required to hit any other ball because the touching ball is on. If the object ball moves, it is considered a and a foul is called. No penalty is incurred for playing away if:\nIf the cue ball is touching another ball which could be on (e.g. touching a colour when the striker must pot a red, or vice versa), a touching ball is not called, and the striker must play away from it \"and\" hit a legally nominated object ball. Where the cue ball is simultaneously touching several balls that are on or could be on, the referee shall indicate that each and every one of them is a touching ball; the striker must therefore play away from all of them.\nThe striker scores no points for balls potted as the result of a foul. Depending on the situation, these balls will either remain off the table; be returned to their original spots; or be replaced in the positions they occupied before the foul shot, along with any other balls that were moved during the shot. For details on such situations, see Fouls below.\nIf a player fails to pot a ball \"on\", whether a red or a nominated colour, the other player will come to the table, with the reds always being the balls \"on\" as long as there are still reds on the table.\nFouls.\nA (or ) is a shot or action by the striker which is against the rules of the game.\nWhen a foul is made during a shot, the player's turn ends, and no points are awarded for any balls potted on that shot.\nCommon fouls are:\nWhen a player commits a foul and the cue ball remains on the table, the opponent may either play from the resulting position or—if the position is disadvantageous—request the offender play again. If the cue ball is potted or leaves the table, the opponent receives it \"in-hand\" and may then place it anywhere on or within the \"D\" for the next shot.\nIt is sometimes erroneously believed that potting two or more balls in one shot is an automatic foul. This is only true if one of the potted balls is not \"on\" (e.g. a red and a colour, or two different colours). When the reds are \"on\", two or more of them may be legally potted in the same shot and are worth one point each; however, the player may only nominate and attempt to pot one colour on the next shot. If a free ball has been granted , a colour may be legally potted in the same shot as a red or another colour, depending on the circumstances.\nShould a cue ball be touched with the tip while \"in-hand\", i.e. when breaking-off or playing from the \"D\" after being potted or knocked off the table, a foul is not committed as long as the referee is satisfied that the player was only positioning the ball, and not playing a shot or preparing to play one.\nThe following fouls award seven points to the opponent when committed:\nAny other foul awards points to the opponent equal to the value of the ball \"on\", the highest value of all balls involved in the foul, or four points, whichever is highest. If multiple fouls are committed in one shot, only the penalty for the highest-valued foul is scored. The penalty for a foul is thus no lower than four points and no higher than seven.\nNot hitting the ball \"on\" first is the most common foul. A common defensive tactic is to play a shot that leaves the opponent unable to hit a ball \"on\" directly. This is most commonly called \"ing\" one's opponent, or alternatively \"laying a snooker\" or putting the other player \"in a snooker\".\nBecause players receive points for fouls by their opponents, repeatedly snookering one's opponent is a possible way of winning a frame when potting all the balls on the table would be insufficient to ensure a win or tie. This portion of the frame is known as the \"snookers-required\" stage.\nFree ball.\nThere were many variations of the rules of snooker in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The Billiards and Snooker Control Council (B&amp;SCC) codified and unified the rules of snooker in 1919. The rules included having a free ball instead of playing from \"in hand\" when there was no clear shot at the object ball after a foul. \nA free ball is a player-nominated substitute for the ball \"on\" when a player becomes snookered as the result of a foul committed by the opponent. The snooker is considered illegitimate in this case, and the affected player is allowed to nullify it by nominating any object ball as being \"on\" for the first shot of their turn. Once the free ball shot is taken legally, the game continues normally; however, if the player who committed the foul is asked to play again, a free ball is not granted. If the free ball is potted by itself, it is respotted and the player scores the points for the actual ball \"on\".\nFor example, as illustrated in the provided picture, if the ball \"on\" is the red, but is snookered by the black due to a foul, the fouled player will be able to name any colour as the free ball. The player could then pot the chosen colour as if it were a red for one point. The colour will then be respotted, the player will nominate a colour to be on for the next shot, and normal play will resume.\nAs a natural corollary of the rules, . If the reds are \"on\", they can only be snookered by colours; after all the reds are potted, the lowest-value colour still on the table is \"on\" and can only be snookered by another colour.\nThe scoring for a shot in which both the free ball and the actual ball on are potted depends on the point in the game at which it occurs. If the reds are on and both the free ball and one or more reds are potted, then each ball potted is scored as a red for one point. If a colour is on and both it and the free ball are potted, only the actual ball on is scored. In both cases, the free ball will be re-spotted and the actual ball(s) on will remain off the table. These two situations represent the only times when a colour can be potted in the same shot as a red or another colour without a foul occurring.\nThe player may hit the free ball into the actual ball on in order to pot the latter, referred to as ing. Going back to the picture above, the player could nominate the black as the free ball and use it to plant the real red. If the player potted both balls in one shot, two points would be awarded and the black would be re-spotted. A foul is committed if the player fails to strike the free ball either first by itself, or simultaneously with the actual ball on.\nFailing to pot the free ball incurs no penalty, so the striker may play a snooker using the free ball if desired. However, if said snooker is achieved by having the free ball obstructing the ball on, then the strike is a foul and a penalty of the value of the ball on is awarded to the opponent. The reason is that the free ball was to be treated as the ball on, and one cannot snooker a ball on by another ball on (following the same logic that a red cannot snooker another red when red is on). The only exception to this is when there are only two balls remaining on the table, namely pink and black. If the opposition somehow fouled trying to pot pink, and illegitimately snookered the striker with the black, then it is fair for the striker to snooker the opposition \"back\" with the free black ball.\nWhen judging a free ball, the cushions are not considered an obstruction and the situation is judged as if they were not there, i.e. as if the table was a flat surface with no limits or edges. When the cue ball gets stuck at the edge of a pocket jaw (commonly referred to as \"angled\") in such a manner that the player is unable to hit any ball on, a free ball is only awarded if all the balls on would be at least partially obstructed by a ball not on, if the cushions were not in the way. If a free ball is not awarded, after a foul, the player may choose to either take the shot from the current position or ask the offender to play again, as per the usual rules on fouls.\nA ball on is considered to be unobstructed only if every portion of it can be directly hit by the cue ball without first making contact with another ball or a cushion. If multiple reds remain on the table, each one is evaluated as if the others were not there, as one red cannot be snookered by another; if at least one red is judged to be unobstructed, a free ball is not granted.\nFoul and a miss.\nA foul and a miss will be called if a player does not hit the ball \"on\" first (a foul) and is deemed by the to have not made the best possible attempt (a miss). In this case, the opponent has the option to request that all balls on the table be returned to their position before the foul, and require the fouling player to take the shot again.\nThe rule was introduced to prevent players from playing s (i.e., deliberately fouling so as to leave the balls in a safe position, reducing the risk of giving a frame-winning chance to the opponent). Multiple misses often occur because players attempt to hit a shot very softly or thinly in situations where a fuller contact might leave their opponent an easy potting chance. This can lead to an apparently easy being attempted several times, as players feel that it is better to concede many points but leave a safe position, than concede none and leave a frame-winning chance.\nIn practice, the \"best attempt\" determination consists of three key elements:\nAll three of these elements must be present in order for the referee to decide that a player has made their best attempt.\nThere are three situations in which a miss will not be called, even if the referee decides that a best attempt has not been made:\nIf a player fouls and misses in a non-snookered scenario, and if the opponent requests that the shot be replayed from the original position, a second failure to make a best attempt is ruled a foul and a miss regardless of the score difference. The fouling player is issued a warning by the referee, and a third such failure forfeits the frame to the opponent. A foul after such a warning is very rare.\nThe end of a frame.\nA frame normally ends in one of three ways.\nThere are three less common ways to end a frame:\nIf the score is tied after the final black is fouled or potted, the black is re-spotted. The winner of a coin toss by the referee decides which player will take first strike at the black; that player receives the cue ball \"in-hand\" for their first shot. Play then continues normally until the black is potted or another frame-ending situation occurs.\nIf the players reach a stalemate situation, as determined by either their own indication or the referee's judgment, they may choose to discard the scores from the current frame and restart it. Should the stalemate last for a certain period of time as specified by the referee, the players must restart the frame.\nMaximum break.\nThe highest break that can be made under normal circumstances is 147. To achieve it, the player must pot all 15 reds, with the black after every red, followed by potting all six colours.\nThis \"maximum break\" of 147 rarely occurs in match play. The fastest maximum break in a tournament was achieved during the World Championships on 21 April 1997, by Ronnie O'Sullivan against Mick Price in five minutes and eight seconds.\nIf an opponent fouls before any balls are potted, and leaves the player a free ball, the player can then nominate a colour and play it as a red for one point, then nominate a colour and pot it for its normal value. It is thus possible to score for 16 reds and blacks (16 * 8), plus the values of all the colours (27), resulting in a break of 155. Under tournament conditions, Jamie Burnett achieved 148 points.\nThe highest possible score, as distinct from the highest possible break, is unlimited and depends on the value of points scored from the opponent's foul shots when added to the player's own scored points (which may not require the highest break). However, the highest possible score from a single visit clearance is 162 (foul on the black, followed by a free ball treated as a red, as above)."

        "text": "John Clifford Curry (born February 27, 1984) is an American former professional ice hockey goaltender. He played for the Hamburg Freezers of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga, and with the Pittsburgh Penguins and Minnesota Wild of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was also part of the Penguins team when they won the Stanley Cup in 2009.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nJohn Curry played for the Breck School Mustangs, where he compiled a 1.80 GAA as team captain and MVP in his senior season of 2001–02. After graduating from Breck, Curry attended a year at the Taft School in Watertown, Connecticut, during which he achieved a 1.46 GAA and a .920 save percentage, and was named a New England Prep School West First Team All-Star.\nAfter high school, Curry received offers to play for numerous Division III colleges, yet enrolled at Boston University as a walk-on third-string goaltender. In his freshman year at BU, Curry played only the final 5:10 against Niagara University, filling in for starter Sean Fields in a 5–1 victory. In the 2004–05 season, Curry became the first-string goalie, posting an 18–11–3 in-conference record, participating in his first NCAA tournament, and winning his first Beanpot final, 3–2, over Northeastern University. As a junior, Curry was named to the RBK All-American second team and was a first-team Hockey East All-Star. He started in 36 of 37 games, attaining a 24–8–4 record that included a 12-game winning streak from December 30, 2005 to February 13, 2006. The team went on to win the Hockey East Championship and Curry played in another NCAA tournament. For the season he garnered awards including Hockey East Defensive Player of the Week (four times), Player of the Week, and Goaltender of the Month. Curry was named assistant captain of the Terriers in the 2006–2007 season, his final season, yet again improving his performance statistically to date and standing out as a key player in the clutch. He again won the Beanpot final, posting a career Beanpot record of 5–0 and setting a record .985 save percentage in his final tournament. He went on to win both the Beanpot MVP and the Beanpot's Eberly Award for goaltending, holding the best recorded GAA of 0.48 with 1 goal allowed. In 2007, Curry was also named a finalist for college hockey's top-player, the Hobey Baker Award, while winning Hockey East Player of the Year and getting the Hockey East Three-Stars award. Curry's college career ended abruptly when he surrendered 5 goals on 26 shots in Michigan State's first round 2007 NCAA Tournament upset of the Terriers. Curry was inducted in the Boston University Athletic Hall of Fame in May 2014.\nProfessional.\nCurry was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Pittsburgh Penguins on July 1, 2007. He was expected to split time with David Brown between the backup goaltending position on the organization's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins and the starting position on the double-A ECHL Wheeling Nailers in the 2007–08 season.\nWith an injury to Pittsburgh starter Marc-André Fleury, WBS starter Ty Conklin was called up to the NHL at the beginning of December 2007, opening the door for Curry to start in WBS. In December 2007 he was named AHL Rookie of the Month, posting a GAA of 1.42 and .939% save percentage. Throughout the rest of the regular season, he established himself as the starter for the team, and was named to the AHL All-Rookie team. In the Calder Cup playoffs, Curry was solid, and backstopped his team to the finals, eventually losing to the Chicago Wolves in 6 games.\nCurry was selected to travel to Sweden with the Pittsburgh Penguins as a backup to Marc-André Fleury and Dany Sabourin at the beginning of the 2008–09 NHL season but did not play. He was recalled in November due to an injury to Fleury and saw his first NHL game action on November 26 against the New York Islanders, replacing Sabourin in the second period and facing Joey MacDonald, whom he had fought in the AHL the season before. He made 11 saves in 30+ shutout minutes as part of a comeback win. Curry made his first NHL start on November 28 in a loss to the Buffalo Sabres, though he stopped 28 of 32 shots. He played 3 games before being sent back to the minors. During the playoffs Curry was up as a spare goalie. Curry did not dressed in the playoffs, but was included on the team picture, and awarded a Stanley Cup ring. Curry did not play enough NHL games in 2008-09 to qualify for engravement on the Stanley Cup.\nCurry was later recalled on January 11, 2010 to replace Marc-Andre Fleury against the Vancouver Canucks. Fleury who was out with a fractured finger, gave Curry his fourth career start with the Penguins. He gave up 5 goals on 14 shots, a save percentage of .643, before being benched early in the second period.\nOn June 16, 2011, Curry left the Penguins organization and signed a one-year contract with the Hamburg Freezers of the DEL. Curry left the Wilkes-Barre Penguins as the all-time leader in both regular season wins and post-season wins.\nOn November 7, 2012, while playing for the Orlando Solar Bears, John Curry was fined for dousing fans of the Gwinnett Gladiators after the game the previous Thursday with water.\nOn February 17, 2014, the Minnesota Wild, the NHL affiliate of the Iowa Wild, signed Curry to a one-year, two-way contract.\nOn April 10, 2014, Curry was the starting goalie against the St. Louis Blues. He recorded 45 saves on 47 shots, and received the first star of the game for his efforts.\nPersonal.\nJohn Curry is the oldest child of parents Steve and Kathy Curry. He has one younger sister, Megan Curry, who attended Amherst College; she was a forward on the Amherst Women's Ice Hockey team from 2007 to 2011, winning two NCAA National Championships in 2009 and 2010."

        "text": "The Valparaiso Beacons men's basketball team represents Valparaiso University in Valparaiso, Indiana. The basketball team competes in the Missouri Valley Conference, having joined that league in 2017 after 10 seasons in the Horizon League. The Beacons play in the Athletics-Recreation Center, which has a nominal capacity of 5,432. The record capacity 5,444 was reached on March 23, 2016, in the NIT Quarterfinal. The team last played in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in 2015.\nFormerly named the Crusaders, the university dropped that name and associated mascot and logos in 2021, because of the \"negative connotation and violence associated with the Crusader imagery\", and because of its use by certain hate groups. On August 10, 2021, the school announced that its sports teams would be known as Beacons.\nHistory.\nThe beginning.\nThe Crusaders' first game was in 1917 as an independent school.\nThe tallest team.\nValpo's \"World's Tallest Team\" was actually a collection of teams that gained Valparaiso national recognition during World War II and began in 1942 when a pair of Michigan City, Indiana brothers, Don and Wally Warnke, joined Valpo when their high school coach, Loren Ellis, was hired as head coach. At tall, the Warnke brothers were ineligible to be drafted into the service. Ellis found several other tall players, including Milt Schoon. Valparaiso did well with the Warnke brothers before Wally was able to enlist and fight in World War II. In 1943, his brother, Don, stayed and was joined by a group of newcomers, including Schoon, Bob Dillie, John Janisch and Alvin Schmidt, as they finished with 17 wins, including a win over No. 1 DePaul in which Schoon held George Mikan to nine points.\nWarnke would graduate following the season, but would return as an assistant coach and later the head coach after Ellis left. In the 1944–45 season. The team won its first 11 games, including a program-defining victory over Long Island at Madison Square Garden. Despite finishing 21–3 on the season, the Crusaders were held out of the National Invitation Tournament, with their spot likely going to Midwest powers DePaul and/or Bowling Green.\nThe iconic photograph of Valparaiso's players standing outside Madison Square Garden is displayed just outside the Athletics-Recreation Center court to this day. The team was inducted into the Valparaiso University Hall of Fame in 2004.\nSuccess in the 1950s and 1960s.\nThe Crusaders joined the Indiana Collegiate Conference for the 1950–51 season. The Crusaders advanced to the Division II NCAA tournament for the first time in 1962.\nIn 1964, Gene Bartow took over as head coach at Valpo and led the Crusaders to their greatest stretch of basketball in school history. They would advance to the Elite Eight that season before losing to Sacramento State. In 1966, the Crusaders returned to the NCAA Division II tournament, losing in the Regional semifinals.\nIn 1967, Valpo returned to the NCAA Division II tournament, beating Southern Colorado (now Colorado State–Pueblo) and again advancing to the Elite Eight before losing to Southwest Missouri State (now Missouri State). In 1969, they hosted a Division II NCAA tournament game for the first time, beating Concordia (IL) before losing to Illinois State.\nIn 1970, Bartow would leave Valpo to coach Memphis State. In 1973 under Bill Purden, the Crusaders notched their final appearance in the Division II tournament, advancing to the Regional finals before losing to Kentucky Wesleyan.\nDivision I.\nThe Crusaders joined Division I before the 1978–79 season. After four years as an independent, they became charter members of the Association of Mid-Continent Universities, which would go on to be known as the Mid-Continent Conference before becoming The Summit League. Valpo struggled mightily in their early years of Division I play, never having a winning record until 1994.\nHomer Drew and sons' Valpo dynasty.\nIn 1988, Homer Drew took the job as head coach. That first season included a win over 19th-ranked Notre Dame in a game that came to be known as \"The Lutheran Miracle\". After struggling early under coach Homer Drew, the Crusaders became a conference power beginning with the 1993–94 season where they finished second. The Crusaders won their first Mid-Continent championship in 1995, led by star player Bryce Drew. However, the team was not invited to the NCAA tournament. The Crusaders won the 1996 conference championship and received their first invitation to the Division I NCAA tournament. In the 1998 tournament, the Crusaders won their only Tournament games, defeating Ole Miss on a last second shot by Bryce Drew. The shot would go on to be an iconic play in NCAA Tournament history. The Crusaders won their second round game against Florida State before losing in the Sweet Sixteen to Rhode Island.\nThe Crusaders won the Mid-Continent Conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament every year from 1996 through 2000. In 2001, though the Crusaders won the regular season championship, they lost to Southern Utah in the conference tournament. Valpo returned to the NCAA tournament the following year, losing to Kentucky in the first round. Homer Drew resigned the following season and his son, Scott Drew, an eight-year assistant under his father, was named head coach.\nScott would lead the Crusaders to another regular season championship, but failed to win the conference tournament and settled for an NIT appearance. After one year as head coach, Scott was hired to take over as coach at Baylor following that school's basketball scandal. Homer Drew returned to coach the team to the NCAA Tournament again in 2004. In 2007, Valparaiso became a member of the Horizon League.\nThe Crusaders played in the title game of the Mid-Continent Conference tournament every year between 1995 and 2004. After three more years as head coach, Drew resigned again and his son and former Valpo star Bryce Drew was named head coach. In five years as coach for the Crusaders, Bryce led them to a postseason appearance every year, including the NCAA Tournament in 2013 and 2015. Following the 2016 season, Bryce was hired to take over at Vanderbilt.\nUnder Homer, Scott, and Bryce Drew, the Crusaders won 13 regular season conference championships and 10 conference tournament championships. The Crusaders appeared in nine NCAA Tournaments, three NITs, two CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournaments, and one College Basketball Invitational in 26 years.\nThe post-Drew years.\nOn April 7, 2016, the school promoted former assistant coach Matt Lottich to the head coach position following Bryce Drew accepting the head coaching position at Vanderbilt on April 6, 2016. For the first time since 1988, a Drew was not the head coach at Valpo. In Lottich's first season, the Crusaders earned a share of the Horizon League regular season championship, but lost in the Horizon League tournament. They received a bid to the NIT where they lost in the first round.\nFollowing the season, Valparaiso agreed to join the Missouri Valley Conference after 10 years as a member of the Horizon League.

        "text": "The 2006 Daytona 500 was the first stock car race of the 2006 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series. The 48th Daytona 500 was held on February 19, 2006, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida, before 200,000 spectators. Hendrick Motorsports' Jimmie Johnson, won the 203-lap race after starting ninth. Chip Ganassi Racing's Casey Mears and Penske Racing South's Ryan Newman finished second and third, respectively.\nJeff Burton claimed his third career pole position with the quickest qualifying lap, and led the first 18 laps until the first round of pit stops. Tony Stewart led the next 20 laps from the 28th lap. Matt Kenseth led from laps 58 to 80 until Dale Earnhardt Jr. took it on the 86th. Earnhardt led seven times for a total of 32 laps, more than any other driver. Before the last round of pit stops, Johnson took the lead from teammate Brian Vickers on lap 187. After Greg Biffle lost control of his car on the final lap, he led Newman and Mears to win under caution. During the race, there were 11 cautions and a race-record 32 lead changes by 18 different drivers.\nJohnson won his first Daytona 500, his first at either Talladega Superspeedway or Daytona International Speedway, and the 19th of his career. The victory occurred after Johnson's crew chief Chad Knaus was suspended for illegal car modifications, for which he was fined $25,000 and suspended until March 22. Johnson won the first of five races of the 2006 season, en route to his first of seven NASCAR Cup Series championships at the season's finish.\nJohnson led the Drivers' Championship with 190 points after the season's first race, followed by Mears and Newman with 170 points each. Elliott Sadler and Stewart were fourth and fifth with 165 and 160 points, respectively. Chevrolet led the Manufacturers' Championship with nine points, followed by Dodge with six points and Ford with four points. The race attracted 20 million television viewers, the most watched NASCAR race in terms of average viewership.\nBackground.\nThe 48th Daytona 500 was the first of 36 scheduled stock car races of the 2006 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series, and was held on February 19, 2006, in Daytona Beach, Florida, at Daytona International Speedway, a superspeedway that holds NASCAR races. Its standard track is a four-turn, 2.5-mile (4.0 km) superspeedway. Daytona's turns are banked at 31 degrees, and the front stretch—the location of the finish line—is banked at 18 degrees.\nNASCAR founder Bill France Sr., who built the Daytona International Speedway, conceived the Daytona 500. The race was first held in 1959, succeeding shorter races held on beaches around Daytona Beach. It has opened the NASCAR season since 1982, and from 1988, was one of four events that require cars to run restrictor plates. The race is often regarded as NASCAR's most prestigious race because it offers the most prize money in American auto racing. Victory is considered equal to winning either the World Series, the Super Bowl or The Masters. It is often called the \"Great American Race\" or the \"Super Bowl of Stock Car Racing\".\nNASCAR held numerous test sessions in preparation for the race on January 9-11 (for teams finishing in an odd-number position in the 2005 car owner points standings) and January 16–18, 2006 (for teams finishing in an even-number position in the 2005 car owner points standings). Every test session began at 9 a.m. EST, stopped for one hour from 12:00 – 1:00 pm. EST, and concluded at 5:00 pm. EST. Jeff Gordon was fastest in the first session with a speed of . Bill Elliott paced the second session with a speed of . Jimmie Johnson led the third session at and Gordon the fourth at . Matt Kenseth and Gordon led sessions five and six with respective speeds of and . Kyle Busch and Sterling Marlin paced sessions seven and eight with speeds of and , while Scott Riggs and Kyle Busch led the ninth and tenth sessions from speeds of and . Dale Jarrett and Kyle Busch led the final two sessions with respective speeds of and .\nThe event featured 58 entrants from 34 different teams. Following a large amount of bump drafting in the Budweiser Shootout, NASCAR implemented two \"no zones\" at the exit of corners, which series officials and multiple digital cameras would check for drivers attempting to ram their cars into the rear of other vehicles in order to gain an aerodynamic or overtaking advantage. Drivers would face a drive-through penalty or disqualification from the race depending on the severity of the bump. NASCAR's vice-president of competition, Robin Pemberton, stated that bump drafting in turns would no longer be tolerated. He commented, \"It crosses over the line when the drivers are in the corner. That is not a good place to bump-draft. A straight line, it's not the best either, but a straight line is far safer than in the corners. There's guys that haven't totally honed the craft of bump drafting.\"\nPractice and qualifier.\nBefore the race on Sunday, there were six practice sessions. The first two were held on February 11 and lasted 120 and 90 minutes, respectively. The following two were held on February 15 after qualifying, and were shortened to 60 minutes. Two days later, another 75-minute practice session was scheduled. The final practice session was held on February 18 and lasted 60 minutes. Kevin Harvick was fastest in the first practice session with a lap of 47.771 seconds, ahead of Gordon, Kyle Petty, Elliott Sadler, Johnson, Jarrett, Elliott, Jeremy Mayfield, Bobby Labonte, and Joe Nemechek. With a time of 47.757 seconds, Sadler led the rain-curtailed second practice session; Gordon was 0.219 seconds slower as he duplicated his first-practice result in second. Elliott improved to third. Jarrett, Johnson, Marlin, Mayfield, Clint Bowyer, Denny Hamlin, and Kurt Busch followed in positions four to ten. Kurt Busch hit a large section of cardboard on the back stretch, stopping the session after an hour.\nOn February 12, 58 cars ran two qualifying laps for 43 slots in the race. Unlike most races throughout the season, qualifying set the first two positions. The remaining drivers had to qualify through the 2006 Gatorade Duels, in which 37 drivers were assigned mostly based on where they finished. Three remaining drivers were chosen through their qualifying speed, and one prior series champion qualified with a champions' provisional. The weather was cold with a tailwind. Jeff Burton was the 34th driver to set a lap time; he took his first pole position at Daytona International Speedway, his first since the 2000 Chevrolet Monte Carlo 400, and the third of his career with a time of 47.581 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Gordon who was 0.169 seconds slower. Kenseth was the only driver to not set a time due to a flat left-rear tire to start his lap. After qualifying, Burton said, \"We just got lucky. That's the best wind we've had down here in all of testing and everything else. It just played into our hands, and we had a car that could take advantage of it.\", and, \"Today had nothing to do with me. The only impact that I had on today at all was to be a warm-blooded person that could mash the gas and turn the thing on. I think Michael Waltrip once said a drunk monkey could do it, and I was a drunk monkey, I guess.\"\nFollowing post-qualifying inspection, Johnson's lap times were deleted due to an illegal rear window template lowered by a track bar adjuster to the right rear of his vehicle, giving Johnson an aerodynamic advantage. Terry Labonte's lap times were also invalidated after it was found that his car's carburetor had non-sanctioned modifications. Both Johnson and Labonte were ordered to start from the rear of the field in the Gatorade Duels. NASCAR did not confiscate Johnson's primary car, and his crew corrected the infraction to let it to compete again. NASCAR ejected Johnson's crew chief Chad Knaus from the Daytona 500, which was unappealable. Knaus was replaced by Hendrick Motorsports lead engineer Darian Grubb.\nIn the third practice session, Dale Earnhardt Jr. led with a 47.024 seconds lap, ahead of Kenseth, Ryan Newman, Kevin Lepage, Scott Wimmer, Jeff Green. Kurt Busch, David Stremme, Burton, and Jamie McMurray. Petty and Kenny Wallace had anxious moments drafting other cars; both drivers were able to control their vehicles. Both Hamlin and Derrike Cope hit a wall beside the track; they continued with no major car damage. Brian Vickers led the fourth practice session with a 46.946 seconds time, with Mike Wallace, Greg Biffle, Jarrett, Kenseth, Bowyer, Robby Gordon, Burton, Chad Chaffin and Dave Blaney in positions two to ten. Mike Wallace had a tire detach and his oil line failed 15 minutes into the session. \nSadler and Jeff Gordon won the Gatorade Duels. The qualifying grid was finalized with Sadler, Kyle Busch, Carl Edwards, McMurray, Earnhardt, Bobby Labonte, Johnson and Mark Martin completing the top ten starters. Travis Kvapil, Hermie Sadler, and Kirk Shelmerdine were the final three drivers to qualify based on their qualifying speed. Terry Labonte began the race on a champions' provisional. Riggs, Kenny Wallace, Wimmer, Mike Skinner, Cope, Larry Gunselman, Chad Blount, Larry Foyt, Andy Belmont, Randy LaJoie, Morgan Shepherd, Chaffin, Carl Long, Paul Menard, and Stanton Barrett were the 15 drivers who did not qualify. Marlin went to a backup car after being involved in a collision in the first qualifying race. Nemechek's team changed his engine after it failed in the second qualifier. \nStremme paced the fifth practice session with a 47.038 seconds, 0.001 seconds faster than Robby Gordon in second. Harvick, Green, Elliott, Ken Schrader, McMurray, Kasey Kahne, Earnhardt and Kurt Busch followed in the top ten. In the final practice session, which took place in warm weather and saw drivers limit their running to preserve their cars, Schrader lapped fastest overall at 46.708 seconds; Martin Truex Jr., Earnhardt, Green, Lepage, Jarrett, Marlin, Petty, Burton, and Brent Sherman completed the top ten. The session passed without major incident. Bobby Labonte's engine failed late in practice, and his team changed engines. Vickers glanced the turn three wall and resumed without major car damage.\nRace.\nAt 9:00 a.m., Nemechek's engine compartment caught fire after oil-covered tire rubber in his exhaust header ignited, requiring his team to replace the wiring harness and the aluminum heat shield beside the engine's header. Live television coverage began at 1:30 pm EDT in the United States on NBC. Around the start of the race, the weather was overcast and cool; forecasts predicted an air temperature of and cloudy conditions. Ronald Durham, pastor of Greater Friendship Missionary Baptist Church in Daytona Beach, Florida, began pre-race ceremonies with an invocation. Hip-hop singer Fergie of The Black Eyed Peas performed the national anthem, and actor James Caan commanded the drivers to start their engines. During the pace laps, Bobby Labonte and Nemechek moved to the rear of the field because they changed their engines. Marlin did the same after going to a back-up car.\nThe race began at 2:45 pm. Burton maintained the lead over the field into the first turn. In turn three, Green's left-rear tire went flat; no caution was prompted because the carcass rolled into the infield grass. By lap three, two different packs of cars had formed; 27 cars were in the lead pack, and the rest were five seconds behind. Earnhardt made it three abreast through the tri-oval on the fifth lap; it returned to two abreast into the back straightaway. Harvick moved from 26th to ninth by lap nine, while Petty dropped 17 positions over the same distance. The top three cars established a single file on lap 15, with the next six rows two abreast. Two laps later, the first caution was given; Truex served to avoid Vickers when he lost control of his car exiting turn two. Vickers collided with the right-hand side wall, causing his car's right-side sheet metal to rub against the right rear tire. During the caution, the field (including Burton), made pit stops for fuel and tires. Sadler led Earnhardt at the lap 21 restart.\nOne lap later, Earnhardt went right to unsuccessfully attempt a pass on Sadler without drafting assistance but fell back. Jeff Gordon took the lead on lap 24th, as Sadler fell to fourth. On lap 25, Kenseth overtook Gordon for first, with Earnhardt second and Stewart third. Earnhardt passed Kenseth for the lead two laps later, as Stewart got loose in turn two and slid up towards Kenseth; he regained control of his car. McMurray gave Stewart drafting assistance in passing Earnhardt for first on the 28th lap. Six laps later, Mike Wallace collided with Mayfield, went into Biffle; no caution was issued. Mayfield entered pit road for repairs on the lap. He made a second pit stop on lap 38 because a fender cut his right-front tire. On lap 40, Stewart remained first, with McMurray second. Mayfield made a third pit stop for sheet metal repairs on the next lap.\nOn the 48th lap, just after Stewart lost the lead to McMurray, Gordon lost control of his vehicle and collided with Stewart's front. Both drivers were sent into the right-hand wall leaving the second turn and incurred right-side damage. The field (including McMurray) made pit stops under caution. McMurray was dropped off his team's jack, causing metal sheet damage, and Edwards had front-end repairs made. As fog fell between turns one and three, restricting visibility, Newman led at the lap 52 restart, followed by Kenseth. Six laps later, Kyle Busch helped Kenseth take the lead from Newman. Kyle Busch lost positions from lap 61, while Kurt Busch moved to third. By the 75th lap, Stewart returned to 13th place. Four laps later, a multi-car collision caused a third caution. Green's car slid upward into J. J. Yeley's path in turn three after colliding with Jarrett, collecting Nemechek. The front of Edwards' car briefly mounted Petty's left-side fender before both drivers slid into the infield grass at turn three.\nThe leaders (including Kenseth) made pit stops under caution. Kurt Busch and Travis Kvapil both staggered their pit stops, leading one lap before their stops. Racing resumed on lap 85 with Kenseth leading and Harvick in second. That lap, as the field spread out in turns one and two, Harvick passed Kenseth for the lead. Earnhardt turned left and exploited Nemechek's slower car to pass Harvick for first on lap 86. Four laps later, Kenseth received drafting assistance from Kurt Busch to recover first place from Harvick on the outside. A fourth caution was prompted when a spring rubber was located on track during lap 91. The leaders (including Kenseth) made pit stops during the caution. Earnhardt led at the lap 96 restart. Entering turn three on the lap, Kenseth overtook Johnson for second. On the 104th lap, Martin used Stewart's drafting to pass Earnhardt on the outside for the lead.\nThe fifth caution was waved on lap 107. Stewart went left and hit the front of Kenseth's car into turn three. This sent Kenseth into the infield grass and backward onto the track in turn three, where he hit no other cars before glancing the wall. The field (including Martin) entered pit road during the caution. Earnhardt took the lead after all cars made their pit stops. Meanwhile, Stewart was sent to the end of the longest line for \"aggressive driving.\" As Stewart and Kenseth exited pit road, Kenseth went to the outside into turn one and collided with Stewart's right-hand quarter. NASCAR ordered Kenseth to serve a drive-through penalty. The race resumed on lap 112, with Earnhardt leading a lap before Biffle overtook him. Kenseth disputed his penalty and remained on track until the 114th lap. Earnhardt retook the lead for two laps, before Kyle Busch led laps 116 and 120 until Johnson passed him on lap 121. On lap 124, Robby Gordon's right-front tire failed in turn three, and he hit the wall, triggering the sixth caution.\nThe field (including Johnson) entered pit road under caution. Elliott led the field on lap 126 before his pit stop. Stewart drove over his pit stall jack, and was ordered to drop to the end of the nearest longest line. Martin led at the lap 129 restart, followed by Johnson. That lap, Johnson unsuccessfully tried to pass Martin on the outside. Martin pulled away with drafting aid from Earnhardt, and the top six had formed a single line by lap 132. Earnhardt reclaimed the lead ten laps later, and Vickers passed teammate Johnson on the outside on lap 143. Vickers took the lead on the next lap. Lap 155 saw the seventh caution; debris was located in the frontstretch groove. All of the leaders including Vickers made pit stops under caution. Johnson went onto the grass to avoid hitting Newman. Earnhardt led Vickers and Newman at the lap 160 restart. Newman passed Earnhardt on the outside for the lead four laps later, which Earnhardt retook momentarily. Kurt Busch moved to second on lap 167.\nKahne helped Earnhardt move to second on lap 171. Kvapil's right front tire burst five laps later, sending him into the turn three right-hand wall and prompting the eighth caution. During the caution, all cars including Newman entered pit road. Vickers led at the lap 181 restart with no new tires on his car. Every driver, except for Kyle Busch and Kurt Busch, turned onto the inside. Just as Johnson overtook his teammate Vickers on the outside in turn two for the lead with Newman's help, the ninth caution was waved on the 187th lap. McMurray collided with Kurt Busch's left-rear on the backstretch, sending Busch into a barrier. Marlin and Jeff Gordon were collected, and debris struck Stewart's car. Johnson maintained the lead at the lap 190 restart. Newman bump drafted Vickers for two laps, before passing him for second, and attempted to challenge Johnson. Casey Mears then overtook Vickers for third.\nJohnson led the next seven laps before an accident brought out the tenth caution flag. Burton slid up the backstretch and hit McMurray, leading Burton to collide with the wall. Burton collided with Bobby Labonte's right side, causing both cars to strike the wall, and Labonte collected Hamlin. During the caution, one of Newman's mechanics pleaded with representatives from Mears' and Sadler's teams to help Newman on the outside for the restart. Both declined because of the chance to win the race. The race restarted on the 202nd lap for a green–white–checker finish extending it to 203 laps, with Johnson leading Newman and Mears. The trio drew clear from the field. Strong runs from Sadler and Earnhardt closed them up to the top three.\nEarnhardt attempted to gain positions by turning right on the final lap, but fell back. Then, Newman attempted to pass Johnson on the outside; Mears remained with Johnson instead of drafting Newman. Biffle spun and hit the turn four wall, causing the eleventh (and final) caution. The field was frozen in place, with the finish order determined by where the drivers were when the caution began. This gave Johnson his maiden Daytona 500 victory, his first at either Talladega Superspeedway and Daytona International Speedway, and the 19th of his career. Mears, Newman, Sadler, Stewart, Bowyer, Vickers, Earnhardt, Schrader, and Jarrett completed the top ten finishers. There were 11 cautions and 32 lead changes among a record-setting 18 different drivers during the race. Earnhardt led the most laps of any racer (32). Johnson led four times totaling 24 laps.\nPost-race.\nJohnson appeared in Victory Lane to celebrate his first Daytona 500 victory in front of a crowd of 200,000 spectators; the win earned him $1,505,124. He believed his team would win without Knaus and dedicated it to his detractors, saying, \"I just have so much pride in my team with the circumstances that we've faced this week. Chad made a mistake and we're dealing with the consequences that come with that. But I think this shows how hard we work to be successful, and nobody can deny the fact that we worked out butts off and won the sport's biggest race.\" Mears said he was happy to be second, the fifth top-five finish of his career, \"These races are so hard to get good finishes in [because] so many people can affect the outcome. Obviously we would have liked to have won [because] it would have forced Chip and Felix [Sabates, team co-owner] to put me in the Indy 500, which would have been a lot of fun. At the end of the day, it was a good finish for us, we had an excellent day and I couldn't be happier – unless we won.\" Third-placed Newman told Mears after the race, \"You cost me a million dollars\". He said he was proud to attempt a pass for the win, \"I told the guys over the radio afterward, if I had that run and didn't take it, I would have had a hard time sleeping tonight – probably for the next 10 or 15 years, maybe – you never know.\"\nRegarding whether Johnson would be allowed to keep the victory, Johnson was declared the winner several hours later after his car passed post-race inspection. Newman noted three of Johnson's previous wins came under scrutiny from NASCAR, adding, \"This could still be the first opportunity for NASCAR to pull away a victory if the thing is illegal, I think a lot of Jimmie Johnson and his talent ... but I'm pretty sure that three of his past four wins have had conflict with the cars being illegal. It's not necessarily good for the sport.\" Johnson responded by criticizing Newman's crew chief Matt Borland and said that he would defend himself and Hendrick Motorsports against personal criticism. Mears believed Johnson earned the victory, \"In my mind, the fact that they got caught earlier in the week took away every doubt in my mind that they'd actually do anything to cheat in this race.\" Hendrick Motorsports founder and owner Rick Hendrick declared Knaus' ejection from the race as unimportant, commenting, \"We've been through inspection I don't know how many times. NASCAR did what they did, and we came back and ran two races. That was history.\"\nTwo days after the race, NASCAR announced penalties for Hendrick Motorsports and Hall of Fame Racing. Hendrick Motorsport's penalties for \"actions detrimental to stock car racing\", and for making an unapproved template modification to Johnson's rear window, included a $25,000 fine for Knaus, who was suspended from NASCAR until March 22, 2006. Knaus was also placed on probation until December 31, 2006; Johnson did not incur a points penalty. The team did not appeal the penalties and Grubb continued in Knaus' role until the Golden Corral 500. Hall of Fame Racing's penalties were for \"actions detrimental to stock car racing\", and for having a non-compliant carburetor in accordance to the 2006 NASCAR Rule Book. Crew chief Philippe Lopez was fined $25,000, and Terry Labonte and team owner Bill Saunders were penalized 25 points in the Drivers' and Owners' Championships. Hall of Fame Racing and its partner Joe Gibbs Racing announced they would appeal their penalties. The appeal was heard before a three-member National Stock Car Racing Commission on March 7 at NASCAR's Research &amp; Development Center in Concord, North Carolina. The penalties were upheld. Hall of Fame Racing decided not to appeal further to Charles D. Strang, the NASCAR National Commissioner.\nKenseth said Stewart purposefully eliminated him from contention on lap 107. He was disenchanted with him, and urged NASCAR to address bump drafting, \"There's no two ways about it. He was mad because earlier in the race when I passed him he got loose, which I didn't think I did anything wrong.\" Stewart argued Kenseth caused the crash, \"I guess Matt didn't think anything when he got me sideways over in (Turn) 2, either. He should have thought about that first. He got back what he started in the first place. I got penalized for that.\" McMurray commented on his accident with Kurt Busch on lap 187, \"I need to apologize to Kurt. I got into him, that was 100 percent my fault and I feel really bad because he had a car capable of winning and I kind of screwed that up for him.\" Earnhardt, who led the most laps of any driver with 32, said he was pleased to finish ninth, \"We had a great race car, built by all the technology and resources at DEI. … We came down here and ran great. That's what we wanted to do. I'm real proud of everybody back at the shop and all my guys down here that have been working on this car all week. It's been a long week.\"\nJohnson led the Drivers' Championship with 185 points after the season's first race, with Mears and Newman tied for second with 170 points. The top ten were completed by Sadler, Stewart, Earnhardt, Vickers, Bowyer, Schrader, and Jarrett. Johnson won his first of five races of the 2006 season and took his first of seven NASCAR Cup Series championships at the season's end. Chevrolet led the Manufacturers' Championship with nine points, Dodge was in second with six points, and Ford followed in third with four points. The race attracted 37 million television viewers; it took 3 hours, 33 minutes, and 26 seconds to complete; because it ended under caution, no margin of victory was recorded."

        "text": "Santiago Alberto Pérez (born December 30, 1975) is a former utility player in Major League Baseball. Pérez was a switch-hitter and threw right-handed. He attended Liceo Victor Estrella High School in Santo Domingo.\nCareer.\nOriginally signed by the Detroit Tigers in 1993 as an undrafted free agent, Pérez never got higher than High-A ball in their organization, although he did display good speed, stealing 17 or more bases three times in the five seasons he was in the Tigers' organization.\nOn November 20, 1997, Pérez was traded by Detroit along with Rick Greene and Mike Myers to the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for Bryce Florie. Pérez started off in Double-A baseball in 1998, but by the end of the season he had seen some time in Triple-A. He remained at the Triple-A level until June 3, 2000, which is when he made his big league debut at the age of 24. He went 0-for-2 in his first game, and he started his career off collecting only two hits in his first 11 at-bats. He collected his first hit off of Valerio de los Santos. His season would not improve much after his poor start, in fact, it would basically stay the same. He ended up hitting .173 in the 52 at-bats that made up his first season. He was however 100% successful in the stolen base category, stealing four bases in four attempts.\nIn the 2000–2001 offseason, the Brewers sent Pérez with a player to be named later to the San Diego Padres for Brandon Kolb and a player to be named later. The two players to be named would end up being Will Cunnane from the Padres and minor leaguer Chad Green from the Brewers.\nAlthough Pérez was with a new team, his luck did not improve much. He played 43 games with the Padres in 2001, coming to the plate 81 times. Overall, he collected 16 hits for a .198 batting average in 2001-a slight improvement over the previous season, but still a poor average. July 1, 2001, would end up being Pérez's last game in the majors. He collected a walk in his only plate appearance in that game.\nAlthough his big league career was over, his professional career was not. In fact, he was bouncing around the minor leagues as recently as 2005, and in 28 games with Double-A Frisco in 2004, he hit .387.\nHis career batting statistics were not stellar, as he hit .188 with no home runs and six RBI in 133 career at-bats. Yet he was still a valuable asset due to his defensive versatility. Not only did he play in all three outfield spots in his career, he also spent time at shortstop and second base. His career fielding percentage was .926.\nHe wore two numbers in his career, 1 and 57."

        "title": "Royal Rumble match",
        "text": "The Royal Rumble match is a professional wrestling match based on the classic Battle Royal match in which a number of wrestlers (traditionally 30) aim at eliminating their competitors by tossing them over the top rope, with both feet touching the floor. The match is typically the main event of WWE's January pay-per-view and livestreaming event known as the Royal Rumble. The winner of the event is the last wrestler remaining after all others have been eliminated. \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin holds the record for most victories at three, achieved in 1997, 1998, and 2001, while Hulk Hogan, Shawn Michaels, John Cena, Batista, Triple H, Randy Orton, Edge, Brock Lesnar, and Cody Rhodes have all won the match twice, with Hogan, Michaels, Austin, and Rhodes the only four to win back-to-back matches.\nConcept.\nThe Royal Rumble differs from the classical battle royal as the contestants do not enter the ring at the same time, but instead are assigned entry numbers, usually via a lottery, although desirable spots are occasionally assigned by other means, the most common being winning a match. The match begins with the two wrestlers who have drawn entry numbers one and two, with the remaining wrestlers entering the ring at regular timed intervals, either 90 seconds or two minutes (60 seconds for the 1995 event), according to their entry number. This format is credited to Pat Patterson. To date, only six wrestlers who have been one of the starting two entrants have won the Royal Rumble: Shawn Michaels in 1995, Vince McMahon in 1999, Chris Benoit in 2004, Rey Mysterio in 2006, Edge in 2021, and Rhea Ripley in 2023. (Michaels, Benoit, Edge, and Ripley were entrant number 1 while McMahon and Mysterio were number 2), while only five wrestlers who have been the final entrant won the Royal Rumble: The Undertaker in 2007, John Cena in 2008, Triple H in 2016, Brock Lesnar in 2022, and Cody Rhodes in 2023. The most common number to win is 30, and 16 eventual winners entered at number 25 or later.\nThe Royal Rumble match traditionally involves 30 wrestlers and usually lasts an hour (the 2011 edition had a 40-man field). The Greatest Royal Rumble (the only edition to have a 50-man field) was the longest, lasting one hour and 17 minutes of a five-hour pay-per-view event while the first televised Rumble match in 1988 involved only 20 men and lasted 33 minutes of the two-hour broadcast. The 1998 match nominally had the traditional 30-man field, but only 28 individual wrestlers competed as Mick Foley entered the Royal Rumble match three different times as three different gimmicks—first as Cactus Jack, then Mankind and finally Dude Love. The 2018 Royal Rumble PPV was the first to include a women's Royal Rumble match, contested under the same rules as the men's match, including having 30 participants.\nAccording to the rules, participants are eliminated from the match if moved over the top rope and both feet touch the floor. Hence, a wrestler who exits the ring without going over the top rope is not eliminated from the contest. For example, during the 1999 match, both McMahon and \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin left the ring only to return later in the match. Furthermore, a wrestler who only touches the floor with one foot is not eliminated from the match, a rule which greatly affected the 1995 match, allowing Michaels to re-enter the ring and win the match. Although he has not won a Royal Rumble match, Kofi Kingston has become synonymous with finding various ways to keep at least one of his feet from touching the floor. In the 1994 match, the last two participants (Bret Hart and Lex Luger) were declared co-winners when officials were unable to determine whose feet touched the floor first. Although this was the intended outcome, a similar situation occurred by a legitimate accident in 2005, when Batista and John Cena eliminated each other and hit the ground at exactly the same time. This time, the match was restarted. Though various referees are charged with observing the match, some eliminations have gone unnoticed to allow the eliminated participants to sneak back into the ring to continue. Austin was able to re-enter the ring in this way and win the 1997 match.\nAlthough eliminations are usually caused by active participants, eliminations caused by other means have been ruled legitimate, including self-eliminations (such as André the Giant after seeing a snake in 1989, Mil Máscaras diving out of the ring from the turnbuckle in 1997, Kane in 1999, and Pat McAfee in 2024, although Randy Savage's jump over the top rope in 1992 was not ruled as self-elimination), elimination by previously eliminated participants (such as The Undertaker eliminating Maven in 2002, Kurt Angle eliminating Michaels in 2005 or Sonya Deville eliminating Naomi in 2022) or non-participants (such as Shane McMahon eliminating Shawn Michaels in 2006 and The Miz eliminating John Cena in 2011). Furthermore, an injured wrestler can return to the ring as long as the match is still ongoing (such as Austin in 1999, Roman Reigns in 2016, and Randy Orton in 2021), but not if the match has already ended (such as Spike Dudley in 2004, Scotty 2 Hotty in 2005, Curtis Axel in 2015, R-Truth in 2019 and Rey Mysterio in 2023) and can also be replaced by another wrestler (such as Mick Foley replacing Test in 2004, Sami Zayn replacing Tye Dillinger in 2018, and Nia Jax replacing R-Truth in 2019).\nPrize.\nSince 1993, the winner of the Royal Rumble match is traditionally awarded a title match for WWE's top championship at WrestleMania—WWE currently promotes two main roster brands with a top championship for each and the winner can choose which championship to challenge for, regardless of the brand they belong to. For the men, that is the World Heavyweight Championship on Raw and the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship (respresenting both the WWE and Universal Championships) on SmackDown. Similarly, the winner of the women's Royal Rumble match (first contested in 2018) is awarded a match at WrestleMania for their choice of one of WWE's top women's championships: Raw's Women's World Championship, or SmackDown's WWE Women's Championship. However, it has never been officially confirmed that a man or woman would be barred from challenging a different gender at WrestleMania.\nWith the first brand extension introduced in mid-2002, the 30 male entrants from 2003 to 2006 consisted of 15 wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brands, respectively. At first, the winner of the match received a shot for their brand's top championship, either the World Heavyweight Championship or WWE Championship. Starting in 2004, the Royal Rumble winner had the option of challenging for either brand's top championship. For instance, Chris Benoit switched from SmackDown to Raw after winning the 2004 event to challenge for Raw's top championship at the time. From 2007 to 2010, participants from the ECW brand competed along with the Raw and SmackDown brands, with the ECW Championship added as an option, although no winner ever chose it. During ECW's participation, the entries for each brand were not evenly divided. The ECW Championship was deactivated in 2010, leaving the two remaining titles until they were unified in December 2013 as the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. This singular option lasted until the brand extensions' return in 2016, which introduced the Universal Championship, as the WWE World Heavyweight Championship reverted to being called the WWE Championship. Like the first brand extension, the winner of the 2017 event earned a match for their brand's top championship, the Universal Championship or WWE Championship, but beginning with the 2018 event, the winner has a choice. NXT - WWE's developmental brand - was elevated to main roster status from September 2019 until September 2021, during that time NXT's top championships (the NXT Championship for men and the NXT Women's Championship for women) were also eligible choices. This ended when NXT reverted back to developmental status in September 2021. Since the return of the brand extension, the number of participants from each brand has not been evenly divided, as matches have also featured NXT wrestlers, as well has surprise entrants such as WWE Hall of Famers and/or debuting wrestlers.\nWWE's top championship has been booked as on the line during the Royal Rumble match on two occasions. In 1992, the vacant WWF World Heavyweight Championship was contested in the Royal Rumble match, which was won by Ric Flair, while in 2016, Roman Reigns was scheduled to defend his WWE World Heavyweight Championship as a participant of that year's Royal Rumble match as entrant number one. This has thus far been the only time that a reigning champion had to defend his title in the match, which was ultimately won by Triple H, who eliminated Reigns before lastly eliminating Dean Ambrose to win; Reigns would earn a rematch against Triple H at WrestleMania 32 and won back the title. In 2008, ECW Champion Chavo Guerrero entered the Royal Rumble match as entrant number 26 before being eliminated by eventual winner John Cena. This was the first time in which a reigning world champion competed in the match in which the winner could challenge them. In 2020, although he did not defend his title in the match, WWE Champion Brock Lesnar entered the Royal Rumble match as entrant number 1, feeling as if no one on any brand deserved to challenge him at either the Royal Rumble or WrestleMania. Lesnar's participation was used as a way to set up his WrestleMania challenger, which ended up being Drew McIntyre, who eliminated Lesnar, won the Rumble match and then challenged Lesnar for his title at WrestleMania 36. In 2022, although she did not defend her title in the match, SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair entered the Royal Rumble match as entrant number 17, feeling as if no one on any brand deserved to challenge her at either the Royal Rumble or WrestleMania. This was the first time in which a reigning women's champion competed in the match in which the champion could choose their opponent; Flair's participation was used as a way to set up her WrestleMania challenger, which ended up being Ronda Rousey, who eliminated Flair, won the Rumble match and then challenged Flair for her title at WrestleMania 38.\nThe Royal Rumble winner may also choose to put his championship opportunity on the line in a match. This was first done in 1996, when Shawn Michaels risked his WrestleMania XII WWF Championship opportunity in a match against Owen Hart at In Your House 6. The second time was in 2002, when Triple H lost his WrestleMania X8 Undisputed WWF Championship opportunity at No Way Out to Kurt Angle, but regained his spot in a rematch against Angle on the following episode of \"Raw.\" The third time was in 2006, when Randy Orton defeated Rey Mysterio at No Way Out for Mysterio's WrestleMania 22 World Heavyweight Championship opportunity, though Mysterio was reinserted into the title match, making it a triple threat match. The fourth time was on the February 25, 2013 edition of \"Raw,\" where John Cena successfully defended his WrestleMania 29 WWE Championship opportunity in a match against CM Punk. The fifth time was in 2015 at Fastlane, where Reigns defended his WrestleMania 31 WWE World Heavyweight Championship opportunity against Daniel Bryan. In a reverse case in 2008, John Cena decided that instead of waiting until WrestleMania XXIV, he would use his world championship opportunity and challenge WWE Champion Orton at the preceding No Way Out event, though won the match but not the title when Orton intentionally got himself disqualified; however, after Triple H became Orton's WrestleMania opponent, Cena earned another opportunity and was inserted into that championship match, making it a triple threat match. In another case in 2017, Randy Orton relinquished his WrestleMania 33 WWE Championship opportunity after his stablemate Bray Wyatt won the title, but later turned on Wyatt and reverted his decision; he then defeated AJ Styles, who had become the new title challenger, to re-earn his title shot at WrestleMania.\nDuring the Greatest Royal Rumble in April 2018, the winner Braun Strowman received a trophy and the Greatest Royal Rumble Championship.\nRoyal Rumble records.\nMen's Royal Rumble.\nLongest time spent in a single Royal Rumble.\nBold indicates the winner of that year's match.\nMost eliminations in a single Royal Rumble.\nBold indicates the winner of that year's match.\nMost eliminations in a single Royal Rumble per year.\nBold indicates the winner of that year's match.\nMost consecutive eliminations.\nBold indicates the winner of that year's match.\nWrestlers who have competed multiple times in the same night.\nThese wrestlers have competed more than once in either the same Rumble match..\nWomen's Royal Rumble.\nLongest time spent in a single Royal Rumble.\nBold indicates the winner of that year's match.\nMost eliminations in a single Royal Rumble.\nBold indicates the winner of that year's match.\nMost eliminations in a single Royal Rumble per year.\nBold indicates the winner of that year's match.\nHighest number of wrestlers in a single elimination.\nHighest number of wrestlers working together to eliminate one wrestler\nOther Royal Rumble matches.\nWWE has also booked several Royal Rumble matches outside of pay-per-view events:"

After playing college basketball for Louisville, Coleman played in the National Basketball Association for the Rochester Royals and St. Louis Hawks from 1949 through 1957.\nCareer.\nA forward and center from the University of Louisville, Coleman played nine seasons (1949–1958) in the National Basketball Association as a member of the Rochester Royals and St. Louis Hawks. He tallied 6,721 points and 5,186 rebounds in his career, and he represented Rochester in the 1955 NBA All-Star Game. Coleman also appeared in three NBA Finals, winning championships with Rochester in 1951 and St. Louis in 1958.\nDuring the Hawks' losing effort in the 1957 NBA Finals, Coleman became the unwitting victim of one of Bill Russell's greatest defensive plays. In the final game of the series, Coleman had an opportunity to clinch the Hawks' championship with a layup after receiving an outlet pass at midcourt. Bill Russell, who had been standing at his own baseline when the play began, ran the entire length of the floor and managed to block Coleman's shot, preserving the victory for the Celtics. Celtics announcer Johnny Most screamed, \"Blocked by Russell! Blocked by Russell! He came from nowhere!\" The play has since gone down in history as the \"Coleman Play.\"\nPersonal life.\nColeman's son, also named Jack, served in the Kentucky House of Representatives in the 55th district from 1991 through 2004.

        "title": "Lithuania women's national basketball team",
        "text": "The Lithuania women's national basketball team () represents Lithuania in international women's basketball competitions. They are regulated by the Lithuanian Basketball Federation, the governing body for basketball in Lithuania.\nThe team is currently ranked 31st in the FIBA World Rankings.\nHistory.\nBasketball first reached Lithuania when the game was already 30 years old. The version originally played was the German (Dutch) variant, not the North American version invented by James Naismith. The baskets were fastened to the poles without boards, and the game was played in a huge court. One of the Lithuanian sport pioneers, Steponas Garbačiauskas, wrote: \"In 1919 Lithuanian women athletes started organizing, but they showed up publicly only in 1920–1921 and started playing basketball.\" Though women started playing basketball in Lithuania before men did, the first official game was played by men on April 23, 1922, when Lietuvos Fizinio Lavinimo Sąjunga (English: Lithuanian Physical Education Union) played a game against Kaunas. LFLS won the game with a score of 8–6. This day is regarded as the beginning of basketball in Lithuania. The first official women's basketball game in Lithuania took place on September 10, 1922.\nThe first European women's basketball championship was organized in 1938. It was held in Rome, Italy. The Lithuanian women's squad competed and became European vice-champions. The team's head coach was Feliksas Kriaučiūnas, already well known for his achievements with the Lithuanian men's basketball team.\nAfter World War II, the Soviet Union occupied Lithuania and forced it to play for the Soviet Union women's national basketball team. The best Lithuanian players, playing for the Soviet Union national basketball team, won several titles with it. As members of Soviet Union team, Lithuanians (men and women) in total won 17 Olympic medals (8 gold, 6 silver and 3 bronze), 17 World championship medals (11 gold, 5 silver and one bronze), and 51 EuroBasket medals (36 gold, 4 silver and 11 bronze). The most decorated Lithuanian players during the Soviet era were Angelė Rupšienė, who won the first two women's Olympic basketball golds in 1976 and 1980 and also the 1971, 1975 Women's World Cup, and Vida Beselienė, who got an Olympic gold in 1980 and the 1983 Women's World Cup. Other Lithuanian world champions were Jurate Daktaraitė (1959), Larissa Vinčaitė (1971), and Chamomile Šidlauskaitė (1983).\nYet the occupation left many painful marks in Lithuania and Lithuanians' memories.\nLithuania women's national basketball team returned to FIBA games only in EuroBasket 1995 and achieved the 5th place.\nThe team's biggest success was achieved two years later in EuroBasket 1997 when the national team, coached by Vydas Gedvilas, became the European champions in Budapest. It was the first and the only European title for the Lithuanian women's basketball squad.\nA Year later, Lithuania participated in the 1998 FIBA Women's World Cup. Despite successful European competition, Lithuanians lost the quarter-finals game to 1994's World champions, Brazil's national team, 70–72 and had to play for fifth place. There they lost to Spain 59–70 and took only 8th place.\nAt the EuroBasket Women 1999, Lithuania took 6th place and failed to qualify for the 2000 Summer Olympics, held in Sydney.\nIn EuroBasket 2001 Women, Lithuanians qualified for four best tournament's teams, though losing the bronze medals game to Spain 74–89. Yet the team qualified for the 2002 FIBA Women's World Cup, held in China.\nAt the Women's World Cup, Lithuania played eight matches and won three, against Taiwan, Cuba and Yugoslavia. They took 11th place. As a consequence, Lithuanian Basketball Federation decided to end collaboration with Vydas Gedvilas.\nIn 2003, LKF Executive Committee chose Algirdas Paulauskas as the new Lithuania women's national basketball team coach. He was working previously as an assistant coach in the national team until the 1996 World Championship when he decided to leave the squad due to poor performance.\nAt EuroBasket Women 2005, held in Turkey, Lithuania, losing their last two matches, to finish in 4th place. Although, they returned to Lithuania with the voucher to the 2006 FIBA Women's World Cup, held in Brazil.\nAt their third Women's World Cup appearance, the Lithuanians lost the 5th-place game to France and took 6th place, repeating the best performance achieved back in 1998.\nAt EuroBasket Women 2007, the Lithuanians were crushed in the 5th-place game against Czech Republic with result 54–93 and lost all chances of competing for the ticket to the 2008 Summer Olympics, held in Beijing. Algirdas Paulauskas left the squad for the second time that year.\nIn 2007, a sculpture dedicated to the Lithuanian basketball was introduced in Vilnius, near the Siemens Arena.

        "text": "Joseph CostelloReshawn Jones (born March 21, 1986) is an American college basketball coach and former player. He played college basketball at Texas A&amp;M (2004–2008) and spent 14 years playing professionally overseas. He is currently an assistant coach for the Tarleton State Texans in the WAC, as the acting head coach for Billy Gillispie.\nEarly years.\nJones was born March 21, 1986, to D.C. Nealey and Betty Jones in Normangee, Texas.\nAs a sophomore, junior, and senior at Normangee High School, Jones was a first-team All-State pick. Averaging 22.4 points and 15.1 rebounds in his senior year, Jones led his school to a 37–2 record, winning their final 23 games. The team earned a trip to the Class A Division I championship game where Jones was named the most valuable player in the title game, with 21 points, 17 rebounds, and 5 blocked shots. Jones was ranked as the Number 86 prospect in the country by HoopScoop and the 12th best post prospect by Rivals.Com.\nJones was recruited by Kansas, Texas, University of Arkansas, and Texas Tech, but signed a National Letter of Intent to play at Texas A&amp;M University under coach Melvin Watkins.\nCollege career.\nFreshman year.\nBefore Jones arrived in College Station, Aggies coach Melvin Watkins was forced out, with former University of Texas El Paso coach Billy Gillispie taking over the program. Jones chose to honor his commitment and made an immediate impact at A&amp;M, scoring 10 points and making 10 rebounds in his college debut against North Carolina AT&amp;T University. Jones, who started in all 31 games, ranked second on the team in scoring with 12.7 points per game and dunks (18) and led the Aggies in rebounding (7.3), field goal percentage (.577), blocked shots (39), and three-point plays (16). He posted seven double-doubles, the most by a Big 12 freshman, and scored 10 or more points 23 times, also setting the A&amp;M freshman record by completing 103 free throws. His performance earned him honorable mention All-Big 12 honors and a place on the Big-12 All-Freshman team, with CollegeInsider.Com also naming him to their Freshman All-America team.\nWith a then-career-high twenty-five points, Jones led the Aggies to a win against Clemson in the first round of the NIT.\nSophomore year.\nAs a sophomore, Jones started in all of the team's games, averaging 15.3 points and a team-best 6.5 rebounds. In one of his most impressive games of the season, Jones scored 31 points against the University of Texas, the most points an Aggie had scored in Austin since 1963. In that game he tied two Big 12 records, one for field goals in a half, making 9 of 11 second-half field goal attempts, as well as for most consecutive shots, making nine straight shots to end the game. Jones also made the game-winning shot against Oklahoma State, completing an 8-foot jumper with one second remaining. The Aggies lost their rematch against Oklahoma State despite Jones's 27 points. Against North Texas, Jones scored a career-high 35 points and had a career-high 13 rebounds.\nJones ranked in the conference's top 10 in scoring and rebounding, despite averaging fewer than 30 minutes per game. His performance earned him consensus second-team All-Big 12 honors, and he was named to the second-team Academic All-Big 12.\nThe Aggies earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1987. The Aggies won their first-round match-up against Syracuse and appeared poised to reach the Sweet 16 when, with 18 seconds left in their second-round game against LSU, the Aggies went up 57–55. The dream was dashed fifteen seconds later, however, when Glen Davis completed a three-point shot for LSU.\nJunior year.\nExpectations were raised for Jones's junior season, when Jones, along with teammate Acie Law IV, was named to the John R. Wooden pre-season top 50 All-American watch list, and the team received a Number 13 rank in the pre-season AP poll, The Aggies have ranked as high as Number 6, the highest rank the school had ever achieved. The team had their best start since opening 16–2 in the 1959–1960 season, as well as their best conference opening since the inception of the Big 12.\nAfter suffering knee problems throughout non-conference play, Jones has been a big part of the Aggies' successful 2006-2007 season, averaging 13.2 points per game and a team-best 6.4 rebounds per game. Despite a cramp in his calf that kept him out of most of the second half of the game against Iowa State, Jones still scored 21 points. Jones is an aggressive player, however, and also leads the team in fouls, averaging 3.4 per game and fouling out of five games.\nThe Aggies have been consistently ranked in the top 10 throughout this season. In a historic moment on February 3, 2007, Jones's Aggies became the first Big 12 South team (in 32 attempts) to ever beat the then-Number 6 Kansas Jayhawks at Allen Fieldhouse. Two days later the team earned a 100–82 victory over their archrivals, then-Number 25 Texas, their twenty-first straight home win, making them the sole leader of the Big 12.\nAlthough the Aggies were the number two seed for the Big 12 Conference Tournament, they played poorly in their first game in the quarterfinals of the tournament and were eliminated in a loss to Oklahoma State.\nOn Selection Sunday, however, the Aggies were rewarded for their regular-season play with a Number 3 seed in the South region of the 2007 NCAA Tournament. In their first-round game against Penn, Jones finished with a double-double, 14 points and 11 rebounds. He energized the team in the second half, scoring two dunks in less than a minute to give the Aggies the lead. The Aggies won 68–52 to advance to the second round of the tournament.\nIn front of an unfriendly crowd during a tough second-round game against Louisville, Jones scored twelve points and had eight rebounds and three steals. The Aggies's 72–69 victory earned them a berth in the Sweet 16 for the first time since 1980.\nSenior year.\nJones, along with Texas Longhorns player D. J. Augustin, was featured on the front cover of the November 15, 2007, issue of \"Sports Illustrated\". Jones graduated from A&amp;M a semester early.\nProfessional career.\nAfter his college career, Jones joined the Houston Rockets 2008 Summer League. The team had a 12-man roster and was coached by Rockets assistant coach Elston Turner. The team played five games against other NBA teams from July 14–20, 2008.\nIn the season 2008–09 has been playing at Oyak Renaul Bursa in the Turkish Basketball League.

On February 21, 2017, he moved to French club Limoges CSP.\nCoaching career.\nIn January 2021, Jones was announced as a new assistant coach at Tarleton State University, where he works under his former A&amp;M coach Billy Gillispie.

Nicknamed 'Jacko', he was an Australia national and Queensland State of Origin representative or . Jackson played club football in the Brisbane Rugby League for the Souths Magpies, before moving to the New South Wales Rugby League and playing for the Canberra Raiders, Brisbane Broncos and North Sydney Bears. He also played in the Rugby Football League for English club Leeds. Jackson worked in the media following his retirement in 1993, and died as the result of a drug overdose in 1997.\nPlaying career.\n1980s.\nIn 1980, Jackson played rugby union in the under-17s Australian schoolboys representative team, before playing in the under-18s Australian schoolboys rugby league team the following year. He went on to play in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership for Souths Brisbane, and proved himself as a valuable attacking player at and under the coaching of mentor Wayne Bennett. At Souths, Jackson was also a teammate of heavyweight centre partner Mal Meninga, and fullback Gary Belcher. In 1986, Jackson made his State of Origin début for the Queensland team coached by Bennett, and the following year he followed Bennett to play for the Canberra Raiders in the NSWRL premiership, where he re-linked with Meninga and Belcher, who had moved there at the end of 1985.\nJackson later signed for the English rugby league club Leeds, and played there for the 1987–88 English season, along with fellow Australian imports Peter Tunks, Steve Morris and Marty Gurr. Jackson played left-, and scored a try in Leeds' 14–15 defeat by St. Helens in the 1987–88 John Player Special Trophy Final during the 1987–88 season at Central Park, Wigan on 9 January 1988.\nJackson also played in the centres at Canberra, appearing in the Raiders' 1987 Grand Final loss to Manly-Warringah in the last Grand Final to be played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The 1988 season saw Jackson achieve international selection for the first time in Australia's successful home defence of The Ashes against the touring Great Britain team. In the Centenary Test in 1988, the first match of the three-Test series at the Sydney Football Stadium, Jackson scored two tries, contributing to Australia's 17–6 win. He went on to play in all three Tests of this series against the Lions, as well as the one-off Test against Papua New Guinea. At the end of this season, Jackson departed Canberra to sign with the Brisbane Broncos for the next two years, once again under the coaching of Bennett.\n1990s.\nJackson joined the North Sydney Bears in 1991 and his arrival, along with the addition of veteran forward Mario Fenech, and goal-kicking winger Daryl Halligan, saw the club's fortunes turn around as they went from being easybeats (not having won a premiership since 1922) to being title contenders. Playing at five-eighth, Jackson was the focal point of the team's attack during their successful 1991 season where they finished just one game shy of qualifying for the club's first Grand Final appearance since 1943, losing the preliminary final 30–14 to defending premiers Canberra.\nAfter being overlooked for a Test return in the first match of the 1991 Trans-Tasman series against New Zealand in favour of former Test captain Wally Lewis, Jackson's form for the North Sydney Bears earned him a recall for the second Test in Sydney after Australia's shock 24–8 loss to the Kiwis in Melbourne. His international return quickly turned sour, though, as he was sent off midway through the first half of the game, which Australia's new-look team won 44–0. Despite his send-off, Jackson retained his place for the deciding Test at Lang Park in Brisbane, where Australia won again, 40–12.\nAt the end of the 1991 season, Jackson toured Papua New Guinea on Australia's short, two-Test tour against the Kumuls in October. The 1992 season saw his form continue for both the North Sydney Bears and for Queensland in the Origin series, and he was selected for the first two Ashes Tests against Great Britain on their 1992 Australasian tour, however Jackson's Test career came to an end when Australia suffered a 33–10 loss to Great Britain in the second Test in Melbourne.\nAlso in 1992, Jackson released a book of \"rugby league facts, funnies and argument starters\" called \"Whatd'ya Reckon!\".\nDeath.\nIt would later be revealed that, as a fifteen-year-old, Jackson had been sexually abused by his (Southport) football coach, Hugh Michael \"Ossie\" McNamara (1935-), a former Roman Catholic Marist Brother (his clerical name was \"Brother Oswald\") who was later convicted and jailed (in 1995) for indecently dealing with a boy at Marist Brothers' College Ashgrove, Queensland. McNamara had molested boys at St Joseph's College, Hunters Hill in Sydney while he was a brother at the school during the 1970s. It has been alleged that McNamara was let go by St Josephs but was never actually charged. McNamara then started working at The Southport School where he sexually abused a number of the 1980 1st XV Rugby team, including Jackson.\nThe trauma caused by this abuse led Jackson to suffer from depression and to use drugs and alcohol throughout his life to try to combat it. In November 1997, Jackson shocked the Australian rugby league community when he died, alone in a Sydney hotel room, of a heroin overdose. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered at both Stanwell Park, where he lived, south of Sydney and at Lang Park in Brisbane.\nJackson's death went on to be used as a powerful image in 2000 in a radio and television campaign to raise awareness of an anti-child abuse campaign. Since 2003, the Peter Jackson Memorial Trophy has been awarded to the person, whether a player or member of the support staff, who makes the greatest contribution to the Queensland State of Origin team each year."

        "title": "Cricket in England",
        "text": "Cricket is one of the most popular sports in England, and has been played since the 16th century. Marylebone Cricket Club, based at Lord's, developed the modern rules of play and conduct. The sport is administered by the England and Wales Cricket Board and represented at an international level by the England men's team and England women's team. At a domestic level, teams are organised by county, competing in tournaments such as the County Championship, Royal London One-Day Cup, T20 Blast and the Women's Twenty20 Cup. Recent developments include the introduction of a regional structure for women's cricket and the establishment of The Hundred for both men's and women's cricket. Recreational matches are organised on a regional basis, with the top level being the ECB Premier Leagues.\nDomestic competitions.\nIn men's cricket, there are eighteen professional county clubs, seventeen of them in England and one in Wales. All eighteen counties are named after, and were originally representative of, historic counties. These clubs are heavily dependent on subsidies from the England and Wales Cricket Board, which makes its money from television and endorsement contracts and attendances at international matches. The English cricket season traditionally starts at the beginning of April and runs through to the second half of September although in recent years counties have played pre season friendly matches at the very end of March.\nEach summer the county clubs compete in the first class County Championship, which consists of two divisions and in which matches are played over four days. The same teams also play one day cricket in the Royal London One-Day Cup, and Twenty20 cricket in the Vitality T20 Blast.\nThe National Counties Cricket Championship is a season-long competition in England for county clubs that do not have first-class status. There are nineteen teams representing historic English counties along with a Welsh minor counties team.\nBelow the county game, there are a raft of club competitions organised on a regional basis. ECB Premier Leagues being the highest level. There are also non-ECB-affiliated leagues such as the Bradford Cricket League, the Lancashire League and the Central Lancashire League.\nIn women's cricket, 36 teams, mainly representing counties, currently compete in the Women's Twenty20 Cup. The Women's County Championship, a one-day competition, was also competed for by counties until it ended in 2019. In 2016 the Women's Cricket Super League was established, a Twenty20 competition with six franchise teams. The Women's Cricket Super League was replaced in 2020 with a new regional domestic structure for women's cricket. This included eight teams each representing a region of England and Wales, and competing in the 50-over Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy from 2020 and the Twenty20 Charlotte Edwards Cup from 2021.\nFirst-class counties.\nThe eighteen first-class counties are the top level men's cricket teams. They are named after historic English counties and include one Welsh county, Glamorgan. \nThe English first-class counties are:\nThe full name of the cricket team is usually formed from the name of the county followed by the words County Cricket Club, which are often abbreviated as CCC.\nDerbies.\nThe following games are considered derbies:-\nMCC.\nThe opening first-class game of an English county cricket season has traditionally been played at Lord's between the MCC and the Champion County (the club that won the County Championship the previous year). When the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) plays against one of the first-class counties, the game is granted first-class status. \nUniversity matches.\nOxford and Cambridge universities played their first match against each other in 1827. After the advent of first class cricket, matches between Oxford and Cambridge, and between either of those two universities and another first class side, were considered first class matches, with the status applied retroactively to earlier matches. Counties started playing matches at other universities in the 1980s, the first being Nottinghamshire vs Durham University at The Racecourse in 1981, but these were not granted first class status.\nThe first University Centre of Cricketing Excellence (UCCE) was established at Durham University by Graeme Fowler in 1996. The success of the Durham centre led to it being adopted as a national model by the ECB in October 2000, with the establishment of six UCCE sides (two – Durham and Loughborough – based around a single university; the others bringing together players from multiple institutions) playing from 2001 in a two-day match competition with a final at Lord's. From 2001 the Oxford and Cambridge matches against the counties were no longer considered first class games, but each UCCE played three early-season matches against county sides, which acted as pre-season warm-ups for the counties, and for Oxford, Cambridge and Durham UCCEs these were considered first class. Matches between counties and Loughborough UCCE were considered first class from 2003.\nThe MCC took over funding of the scheme from 2005, and from 2010 the UCCEs were rebranded as MCC University (MCCU) teams. A further re-arrangement in 2012 granted first-class status to all six MCCUs, but only for two of the three matches against county sides each season.\nThe MCC ceased funding the programme in 2020, with the organisation transferring back to the ECB. The matches between the MCCUs and counties, and the annual University Match between Oxford and Cambridge, were no longer considered first class matches after 2020. No MCCU matches were played in 2020 due to COVID, although the last first class Oxford-Cambridge match was played that September.\nAs of 2022, pre-season matches with first class counties are played under the name of \"English University Matches\" (according to the ECB website, although Wisden uses the term ECB University Matches), and Exeter has been added to the universities participating. Both the ECB and Wisden list the university teams participating in these pre-season matches as MCCUs, but they compete in British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS) limited-over matches as UCCEs. Inter-university matches outside of BUCS and the Oxford-Cambridge match have not, as of 2022, resumed after COVID.\nThe university teams that have played first-class cricket, the dates when they held that status, the universities they represented and the number of first class matches played are:\nTeams representing a single university:\na Date of earliest first class match listed on the Cricket Archive; formal first class status from 1895.\nb Includes matches prior to 1895 regarded as first class by the Cricket Archive; see .\nTeams representing multiple universities:\na Date of earliest first class match listed on the Cricket Archive; formal first class status from 1895.\nb Includes two matches prior to 1895 regarded as first class by the Cricket Archive; see .\nThe Oxford and Cambridge Universities team played 18 first class matches against touring sides from 1839 to 1992, including two before official first class status started in 1895. The Combined Universities (British Universities from 1995) team, formed originally from Oxford and Cambridge but including other universities from 1987, played in the limited overs Benson &amp; Hedges Cup from 1975 to 1998 and played 13 first class matches against touring sides from 1993 to 2006. The MCC Universities team (formed from the six MCCUs) played various matches from 2007 to 2017, including entering the Second XI Championship from 2009 to 2017.\nWomen's Domestic Regional Hubs.\nThe eight women's teams represent \"regional hubs\" and are partnered with the counties in their region. Each team has at least six professionally contracted players.\nThe Hundred.\nOriginally scheduled to start in the 2020 season but postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hundred is a 100 ball cricket competition which consists of eight city-based franchise teams, each of which field both a men's and women's team, in a league format.\nRecreational club competitions.\nThe ECB runs a national club knock-out competition, the ECB National Club Cricket Championship, and has in place a regional Premier League pyramid system for recreational club cricket in England and Wales.\nCricket grounds.\nThe cricket grounds of England and Wales are smaller than the largest in some other countries, especially India and Australia, but the best of them have been modernised to a high standard, and two new international grounds have been built in recent years. The largest English cricket ground, Lord's in London, is internationally regarded as the \"home of cricket\".\nTest matches have been played at 24 grounds across the country. Five of these grounds have hosted both men's and women's Tests in their history: The Oval (South London), Old Trafford (Manchester), Trent Bridge (Nottingham), Headingley (Leeds) and Edgbaston (Birmingham).\nThe other grounds to have hosted a Test match since 2010 are Sir Paul Getty's Ground (Wormsley Park), St Lawrence Ground (Canterbury), County Ground, Taunton, Bristol County Ground, Sophia Gardens (Cardiff), the Rose Bowl (Southampton) and Riverside Ground (Chester-le-Street).\nGoverning body.\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) is the governing body of cricket in England and Wales. It was created on 1 January 1997 combining the roles of the Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB), the National Cricket Association (NCA) and the Cricket Council.\nThey are full members of the International Cricket Council.\nNational teams.\nIn men's cricket, England is a founding Test cricket, One Day International and Twenty20 nation. England played in the first ever Test match in 1877 (against Australia in Melbourne) and the first ever One Day International in 1971 (also against Australia in Melbourne).\nEach summer foreign national teams visit England to play Tests, One Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals. In the British winter the England team tours abroad. The highest profile rival of the England cricket team is the Australian team, with which it competes for The Ashes, one of the most famous trophies in British sport.\nIn women's cricket, England played in the first Women's Test series against Australia in 1934–35. They won the first Women's Cricket World Cup in 1973, and again in 1993, 2009 and 2017. They played in the first ever Twenty20 International for either gender, against New Zealand at Hove, and they won the inaugural World Twenty20 in 2009.\nPopularity.\nIn 2005 the ECB concluded a commercial arrangement with BSkyB which gave Sky the exclusive television rights for live Test cricket in England for four years (the 2006 to 2009 seasons). This deal, which took live Test cricket for home England matches away from terrestrial television for the first time generated substantial future revenues for English cricket, but was criticised by many England cricket supporters and others.\nThe Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketer of the Year is an annual award voted by the Cricket Writers' Club for the best young cricket player in England and Wales, and has been awarded since 1950.\nCricket is also one of the most popular participation sports in England after football, rugby and tennis with most villages running a side every Sunday through the season, and towns putting out 2, 3, 4 and occasionally 5 sides for Saturday league matches, and 1 or 2 sides on a Sunday. According to the mid year 2020-21 Active Sport England survey an estimated 181,500 people play cricket at least twice a month, a 0.4% fall compared to the previous year. Around 65% population of England follow Cricket."

        "title": "Leonard Thompson (American football)",
        "text": "Leonard Irwin Thompson (July 28, 1952 – August 15, 2021) was an American professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL), spending his entire career with the Detroit Lions (1975–1986).\nThompson was an eighth-round pick in the 1975 NFL Draft out of Oklahoma State. He spent his first five seasons as a backup at halfback and wideout for the Lions (his position at halfback was why he wore #39 even after playing exclusively as a receiver, which is technically outside of the NFL's uniform numbering system [receivers were only limited to wearing numbers between 80 and 89 then]). On December 11, 1977, Thompson blocked a David Lee punt on the Baltimore Colts 21 yard line, returning it 2 yards for a touchdown with 14 seconds left in the game. The clutch play gave the Lions an improbable 13-10 victory.\nIn 1980, Thompson earned a starting role as wide receiver opposite Freddie Scott. Thompson caught 19 passes for 511 yards and 3 touchdowns. He caught another 214 passes over the next six seasons, including 26 touchdowns. He would lead the Lions in receiving in 1985 with 51 catches, for 736 yards and 5 scores.\nThompson's career ended when the Lions released him before the start of the 1987 season. He played all 12 seasons of his career with the Lions, scoring 39 total touchdowns.\nCollege career.\nLeonard Thompson played high school football at Pueblo High in Arizona. He attended Arizona Western College before being discovered by Scouts at Oklahoma State, who convinced Thompson to transfer there. Thompson would see his first action at running back for the Cowboys in 1973. Oklahoma State, coached by Jim Stanley, struggled to a 5-4-2 record in 1973. During his first season of action, Thompson carried the ball 90 times for 518 yards and six touchdowns. During his senior season in 1974, Thompson worked both as running back and wide receiver. He carried the ball fewer times in 1974, 33, and scored fewer touchdowns, 3. However, Thompson emerged as a receiver out of the back field, catching five passes for 114 yards and a touchdown. To further show Thompson's athletic skills, he even pass for one touchdown during his senior season.\nPro career.\nLeonard Thompson was drafted by the Detroit Lions in the 8th round (194th player selected overall) of the 1975 NFL Draft. The same draft produced Doug English, who would go on to a multi-All Pro career for the Lions, but Thompson would play for the franchise longer than any other player drafted by the Lions that year. For the first four seasons of his career, Thompson played in every game, but only occasionally was a starter. Despite starting in only one game for the Lions in 1978, Thompson still caught four touchdown passes that season. The first touchdown pass in his pro career came in the form of a 19-yard pass from quarterback Gary Danielson in the Lions 21-14 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals.\nWhereas Thompson began to emerge during the 1980 season, his career year was in 1981. He was a full-time starter for the first time in his pro career, as he hauled in 30 passes for 550 yards and three touchdowns. While the Lions finished 8-8 under head coach Monte Clark, the Lions could not find consistency under center after Danielson was injured. Both Eric Hipple and Jeff Komlo did their best. The Lions lost both Komlo starts and went 6-4 under Hipple, who was in his second year. Despite the Lions instability at quarterback over the next few seasons, Thompson would be a constant for the Lions offense. Thompson caught seven passes for 150 yards in the Lions wild card 31-7 loss to the Washington Redskins, in the post season of the strike shortened season. The Lions won the NFC central the following season with a 9-7 record. They received a first round play, but lost to the San Francisco 49ers in the divisional round. In that game, Thompson caught six passes for 74 yards, but the Lions lost in the last minutes of the game when 49ers quarterback Joe Montana threw a touchdown pass to Freddie Solomon. The following season the Lions tail spun into a 4-11-1 record, despite Thompson catching 50 passes for 773 yards, and the emergence of the speedy Jeff Chadwick at receiver. Thompson had emerged as a favorite target of Hipple's but it was around this time that Thompson began to have issues with his knees. His knees gave him so much trouble, Thompson's participation in practice was limited. It wasn't long before Thompson had to have multiple surgeries on his knees.\nIn 1986, his final season in the NFL, Thompson caught 25 passes for 320 yards and five touchdowns. However, he would have a shining moment that season. In a nationally televised Monday Night game against the Chicago Bears, catching a touchdown pass from rookie Chuck Long. However, the Bears came back to beat the Lions 16-13. This wasn't the only time Thompson came through in a nationally televised game. In a Thanksgiving contest against the New York Jets in 1985, Thompson caught three touchdown passes from Eric Hipple as the Lions cruised to a 31-20 win.\nThompson's NFL career came to an end when the Lions released him after the preseason in 1987. Thompson ended his career as the Lions all-time leader in touchdown receptions with 35, a mark that was passed by Herman Moore and later by Calvin Johnson, the latter who is now the Lions all-time leader in touchdown receptions. Thompson ranked at third with 35."

The refereeing panel comprises seven members from the Elite Panel of ICC Referees, with Clive Lloyd not being included due to his role as West Indies' team manager. Aleem Dar went on to stand as an umpire in his first World Cup final, alongside Steve Bucknor who was appearing in his fifth final in a row - extending his record of four from the 2003 World Cup.\nUmpires.\nFrom the International Panel, Russell Tiffin of Zimbabwe, Nigel Llong of England and Suresh Shastri of India were identified as the reserve umpires, should a member of the above panel have become unavailable. None were eventually called on by the end of the tournament.\nReferees.\nSeven of the eight members of the Panel of ICC Referees were included in the roster to perform match refereeing duties throughout the tournament. The only member to be left out was Clive Lloyd due to his commitment as coach of the West Indies cricket team; however he announced his retirement from match refereeing towards the end of the Super 8 stage of the competition.\nMatch appointments.\nSuper 8 stage appointments.\nUmpires:\nOnly umpires from the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires officiated from the Super Eight stage of the competition until its conclusion.\nReferees:\nChris Broad, Mike Procter, Jeff Crowe, Ranjan Madugalle were chosen to officiate the matches from the Super Eight stage onwards.\nSemi-finals.\nAfter a review of the performance of the umpires throughout the tournament the best four umpires were appointed to officiate on-field in the semi-finals. The role of third umpire will be filled by the two next best umpires, and likewise for the fourth umpire appointments.\nOf the appointed umpires, Bucknor and Koertzen have stood on-field before in World Cup semi-finals. Taufel and Dar served as third and fourth umpires respectively in the semi-finals of the previous tournament in 2003.\nFinal.\nThe two on-field umpires for the final were chosen after a performance review, such that they are the two best umpires from the tournament (independent of the competing nations). The third and fourth umpire roles were filled by the same process.\nSince the officials had to be independent of the two nations participating in the final, Simon Taufel and Daryl Harper were ineligible to umpire, whilst Ranjan Madugalle could not serve as the match referee.\nThis was Aleem Dar's first appointment in a World Cup final, and prior to the match had said that it was to be the most important game of his career to date. Steve Bucknor, on the other hand, stood in his fifth consecutive World Cup final, extending his previous record of four in a row, though this competition held a special note, having been held in his native West Indies. He said that this appointment was a dream come true.\nCriticism of umpires.\nWhilst the majority of the tournament passed without any major criticism of the umpires or errors on their part, the Final was wrought with confusion and was described as a \"farcical finish\" to the competition.\nRain affected the start of the match, reducing the contest to 38 overs a side, and further rain reduced the Sri Lankan innings to 36 overs. With Australia almost certain victors with just 3 overs to go, bad light began to affect play and the umpires seemed to offer the Sri Lankans the opportunity to leave the field for bad light. Both teams assumed this would have granted Australia victory that evening, but they were soon informed that if the light improved the match would have to continue; and if not then the final 3 overs would be played the next day. Sri Lanka's batsmen eventually came out and played out the final 3 overs regardless, and Australia were eventually crowned champions.\nMatch referee Jeff Crowe revealed a \"communication breakdown\" between himself, on-field umpires Aleem Dar and Steve Bucknor and third umpire Rudi Koertzen was to blame for the mix-up, which overlooked Law 21 of the laws of cricket. The law states that, in a One Day International, providing a minimum of 20 overs have been played then a result can be reached using the Duckworth-Lewis system.\nThe ICC issued a statement apologising for occurrence of the incident, but said that none of those involved would be sacked. Two months later it was announced that all five officials involved - the two on field umpires, the third and fourth umpires and the match referee - were to be reprimanded by suspension to prevent them officiating in the 2007 Twenty20 World Championship."

        "text": "John Joseph Doyle (October 25, 1869 – December 31, 1958) was an Irish born first baseman in Major League Baseball whose career spanned 17 seasons, mainly in the National League.\nHe was born in Killorglin, Ireland, and emigrated to the U.S. when he was a child, his family settling in Holyoke, Massachusetts.\nPlaying career.\nAfter attending Fordham University, he embarked on a baseball career that would last 70 years. He made his first appearance at the major league level by signing and playing two years for the Columbus Solons of the American Association. Doyle would play for ten clubs from to , batting .299 in 1,569 games with 518 stolen bases. He began as a catcher–outfielder and became a first baseman in . His best years were in 1894, when he batted .367 for the New York Giants, and in , when he hit .354 with 62 stolen bases for the Baltimore Orioles. He is credited with being the first pinch-hitter in pro ball, with Cleveland at Brooklyn on June 7, . Patsy Tebeau was the manager and Doyle came through with a game-winning single.\nFor the season, he took over the everyday duties at first base and became team captain. Manager John Montgomery Ward not only made the decision to replace his former teammate and friend Roger Connor, but released him as well. Connor was a very popular player, and this decision drew the ire and scrutiny from the fans and media alike. Ward defended his decision and claimed the move came down to the fact that he liked Doyle's playing style, describing him as a hustler. Replacing Connor at first base proved worth the risk, as Jack batted .367 that season, and he totaled 100 runs batted in and stole 42 bases.\nDirty Jack.\nBecause of his aggressive playing style, Doyle was known as \"Dirty Jack\", often feuding with umpires, fans, opposing players, and even, at times, his own teammates. On one occasion, in Cincinnati on July 4, , while in the 3rd inning of the second game of a doubleheader, Doyle slugged umpire Bob Emslie after being called out on a steal attempt. Fans jumped from the stands as the two fought before being chased back by policemen. After players finally separated Doyle from Emslie, he was arrested and fined. On July 1, , when he was being harassed by a Polo Grounds fan, he jumped into the stands and hit him once with his left hand, reinjuring it after having broken it several weeks earlier.\nHe carried on a lengthy feud with John McGraw that started when they were teammates at Baltimore. McGraw, of course, had to have the last word. In , McGraw was appointed manager of the Giants, and his first act was to release Doyle, even though he was batting .301 and fielding .991 at the time. Even with these seemingly out-of-control traits, Doyle was deemed a natural leader and was selected as team captain in New York, Brooklyn and Chicago, and served as an interim manager for the Giants in and Washington Senators in .\nMinor league success.\nIn 1905, after playing one game with the New York Highlanders, Doyle became manager of Toledo of the Western Association. One year later, in , he was named the manager of the Des Moines Champions, so named because they won the league championship the previous year, and won it again under Doyle's helm. Following his championship season at Des Moines, he managed Milwaukee in .\nOther career capacities.\nIn 1908–09, the only years of his adult life spent outside of baseball, he served as police commissioner of his hometown of Holyoke. Doyle returned to the game as an umpire and worked in the National League for 42 games in . Later on he would join the Chicago Cubs as a scout in . In his many years with the Cubs, Doyle was credited with signing or recommending the acquisition of such stars as Gabby Hartnett, Hack Wilson, Billy Herman, Stan Hack, Bill Jurges, Charlie Root, Bill Lee, Augie Galan, Riggs Stephenson and Phil Cavarretta. He remained in that capacity until his death on New Year's Eve 1958 at the age of 89. He was buried at St. Jerome Cemetery in Holyoke.\nHonors.\nIn the Irish Baseball League, the annual award for best slugger is named \"The 'Dirty' Jack Doyle\" Silver Slugger Award."

        "text": "Sean Ward Farrell (born May 25, 1960) is an American former professional football player who was a guard for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, New England Patriots, Denver Broncos, and Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL). Farrell attended Westhampton Beach High School in Westhampton Beach, New York, where he was a football and track star. He then played college football for the Penn State Nittany Lions, earning All-American honors in 1980 and 1981.\nFarrell was the first-round draft pick of Tampa Bay in the 1982 NFL Draft; Buccaneers management had actually intended to select defensive end Booker Reese, and Farrell's name was turned in due to a communication error in the draft room. The team then traded the next year's first round pick in order to get Reese as well. Ironically, Farrell played at a high level for the Buccaneers, while Reese ultimately came to be considered one of the most disappointing draft picks in team history.\nTampa Bay's team performance declined during Farrell's years with the team. After his first contract expired in 1985, he signed a one-year contract for the 1986 season based on the team's assurances that things would improve, but the team had another bad year and Farrell made news by publicly telling a group of Bucs fans, \"I know what I want this Christmas . . . I want to get the hell out of Tampa Bay.\" \nNew England acquired him in return for three draft picks, and he was the Patriots' starting guard for three seasons before shoulder surgery kept him on the injured reserve list for most of the 1990 season. Near the end of that season, the Patriots tried to reactivate him without using a protective designation for him; under the rules then applicable, this had the effect of putting him on waivers, and he was claimed by the Denver Broncos. He finished that year and played another in Denver, then one more for Seattle before concluding his NFL career.\nAfter football, Farrell became a financial advisor with several investment companies including Merrill Lynch, and he is the chairperson of the Gay Culverhouse Player Outreach Program to assist former NFL players facing disability issues after their careers."

        "title": "Royal Rumble (2008)",
        "text": "The 2008 Royal Rumble was the 21st annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brand divisions. The event took place on January 27, 2008, at Madison Square Garden in New York, New York. The event was also the first WWE pay-per-view broadcast in high definition. As has been customary since 1993, the Royal Rumble match winner received a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 2008 event, the winner received their choice to challenge for either Raw's WWE Championship, SmackDown's World Heavyweight Championship, or the ECW Championship at WrestleMania XXIV.\nFive professional wrestling matches were featured on the event's supercard. The main event was the 2008 Royal Rumble match, which featured wrestlers from all three brands. Raw's John Cena, the surprise 30th entrant returning from a torn pectoral muscle, won the match by last eliminating Raw's Triple H, the 29th entrant. The primary match on the Raw brand was Randy Orton versus Jeff Hardy for the WWE Championship, which Orton won to retain the title. The primary match on the SmackDown brand was Edge versus Rey Mysterio for the World Heavyweight Championship, which Edge won to retain the title. The featured matches on the undercard were Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) versus Ric Flair in a Career Threatening match and John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) versus Chris Jericho.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every January by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, dubbed the \"Big Four\". It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The 2008 event was the 21st event in the Royal Rumble chronology and was scheduled to be held on January 27, 2008, at Madison Square Garden in New York, New York. It featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands. It was also the first WWE pay-per-view broadcast in high definition.\nThe Royal Rumble match generally features 30 wrestlers. Traditionally, the winner of the match earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For 2008, the winner could choose to challenge for either Raw's WWE Championship, SmackDown's World Heavyweight Championship, or the ECW Championship at WrestleMania XXIV.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised six matches, including one dark match, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's television shows, \"Raw\", \"SmackDown\", and \"ECW on Sci Fi\".\nPrior to the annual Royal Rumble match, several qualifying matches for the match took place on \"Raw\". The first qualifying match was on the December 31, 2007, episode as Umaga squashed Jim Duggan to earn a place in the Rumble. Snitsky also defeated Drew McIntyre at a house show in White Plains, New York to also qualify for the Royal Rumble. Triple H was disqualified against Ric Flair after interference from Raw general manager William Regal; therefore he was no longer allowed to compete in the Royal Rumble match, per the orders of Regal. After Triple H destroyed part of the lower TitanTron on the January 14 episode, however, Vince McMahon announced he would allow Triple H a second chance at the Royal Rumble if he could defeat his opponent on the January 21 episode. Triple H defeated Snitsky, Mark Henry, and Regal in a gauntlet match to gain entry.\nThe main feud on the Raw brand was between the Intercontinental Champion Jeff Hardy and Randy Orton, with the two feuding over the WWE Championship, which was held by Orton. Orton retained the title at Armageddon against the returning Chris Jericho after being disqualified, when the then-\"SmackDown!\" broadcaster John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) interfered and kicked Jericho in the head. Orton retained the championship, as a result, due to titles not changing hands on disqualifications. On the same night earlier, Jeff Hardy had defeated Triple H to earn the opportunity to face Orton at the Royal Rumble for the WWE Championship. The following night, on the December 17, 2007, episode of \"Raw\", Hardy teamed up with Shawn Michaels to defeat Orton and Mr. Kennedy after Hardy pinned Orton. Two weeks later on the last \"Raw\" of 2007, Hardy and Orton had a face-to-face confrontation. Orton looked set to RKO Hardy, but Hardy countered and delivered a Twist of Fate to Orton. Later in the night, during Hardy's match with Santino Marella, Orton appeared on the \"Raw\" TitanTron and stated that he had kicked Jeff's brother Matt where his appendix used to be, proceeding further to punt him in the head. The following week on a special \"Raw Roulette\" edition of \"Raw\", Hardy retained his Intercontinental Championship against Umaga in a Steel Cage match after performing a Whisper in the Wind from the top of the cage. On the January 14, 2008 edition of \"Raw\", Hardy agreed to face Orton that night with his Intercontinental Championship on the line. However, as soon as the bell rang for the match, Orton immediately low-blowed Hardy, getting himself disqualified. Orton tried to deliver an RKO to Hardy on the concrete floor outside, but Hardy retaliated and the two began to brawl up the ramp. When Orton looked set to kick Hardy in the head, the Intercontinental Champion countered and back-dropped Orton onto the arena floor below. Hardy then climbed 30-feet above on the \"Raw\" set, and then Swanton Bombed off the side of the set onto Orton below. The following week on \"Raw\", Hardy and Orton were scheduled to \"shake hands\", but Hardy instead shook the hands of \"people he respected more than Orton\", like Lilian Garcia, Jerry Lawler, Jim Ross, and several fans in the crowd before re-entering the ring to confront Orton. A frustrated Orton ordered Hardy to shake hands with him, but Hardy performed a Twist of Fate on the WWE Champion instead.\nThe main feud on the SmackDown brand was between Rey Mysterio and Edge with the two feuding over the latter's World Heavyweight Championship. Mysterio won a Beat the Clock Challenge on the January 4, 2008 edition of \"SmackDown!\" defeating Edge with 90 seconds to go, and securing an opportunity for the World Heavyweight Championship at the Royal Rumble.\nThe rivalry between Chris Jericho and John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) started in Jericho's WWE Championship match against Randy Orton at Armageddon. During the match, Orton whipped Jericho over the \"SmackDown!\" announce table straight into JBL and when Jericho tried to get up, he \"nudged\" JBL out of his way. Later in the match, Jericho had Orton trapped in the Walls of Jericho, when JBL stormed into the ring and kicked Jericho in the head, thus giving the win to Jericho via disqualification, and hence, Jericho did not win the WWE Championship. This led to an argument the next night on \"Raw\", where Jericho ended up stating to JBL, who appeared via satellite from the \"Raw\" TitanTron, that he was no longer a \"wrestling god\", but a \"wrestling afterthought\". Afterward, JBL gave his farewell address as \"SmackDown!\" color commentator on the December 21, 2007 airing of \"SmackDown!\" and announced his return as an active wrestler on \"Raw\". JBL made his return to \"Raw\" on December 31, entering in his personal limousine with balloons and confetti shooting from the ceiling, and proceeded to address the crowd, Jericho quickly interrupted his promo and the two brawled until officials separated them. The following week, Jericho was put into a handicap match against Snitsky and JBL, which ended with JBL hitting Jericho in the head with the ring bell, resulting in a disqualification. He then tied a cable wire around Jericho's neck and dragged Jericho, by the wire, from near the ring to the \"Raw\" set, where he assaulted him some more. Jericho suffered from a bruised larynx, burns around his neck, and had difficulty speaking for a week.\nEvent.\nBefore the event went live on pay-per-view, Shannon Moore and Jimmy Wang Yang defeated Deuce 'n Domino in a dark match. The first match that aired was a non-title \"Career Threatening\" match between the WWE United States Champion Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Ric Flair, in which had Flair lost, he would have had to retire from wrestling. At the start of the match, Flair started out working on MVP's left arm. Flair attempted to get the figure-four leglock on MVP, but MVP turned it into a small package for a two count. MVP executed a running big boot on Flair in the corner and went for a pin, but Flair managed to get his foot on the rope when the referee Charles Robinson counted to three. After the three count, the referee did not call for the bell as he had noticed Flair's leg on the bottom-rope and restarted the match. The match ended when MVP attempted a Playmaker, but Flair countered the attempt into the figure-four leglock, to which MVP eventually tapped out. Hence, Flair won and kept his career alive.\nThe second match was between John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) and Chris Jericho. The match began with Jericho trapping Layfield in the Walls of Jericho. JBL got to the ropes, however, and slid out of the ring with Jericho quickly following him. JBL strangled Jericho with the ring ropes and later, plunged him onto the ropes. Jericho recovered and clotheslined JBL out of the ring. When they got in again, JBL threw Jericho into the ring post, as a result of which, Jericho was busted open. JBL tried to take advantage of this situation, but Jericho still fought back. The fight went outside the ring, where JBL began clearing the ECW announce table. Jericho grabbed a steel chair and hit JBL with it. The referee immediately disqualified Jericho, who ignored the fact that he had lost the match and started to strangle JBL with some wires by the ring, in the same process JBL did to Jericho on \"Raw\".\nThe third match was for the World Heavyweight Championship with champion, Edge taking on Rey Mysterio. During the match, Vickie Guerrero stood up from her wheelchair, attempting to comfort Edge. Mysterio had Edge set up for the 619, and Vickie jumped in the way, risking herself. Edge then recovered, and speared Mysterio in mid-air for the pinfall.\nThe fourth match was between the Intercontinental Champion Jeff Hardy and Randy Orton for Orton's WWE Championship. Early in the match, Hardy performed a baseball slide on Orton who hit head-first into the barricade outside due to the impact. Knowing he couldn't win the WWE Championship via a countout victory, Hardy brought the knocked-out Orton into the ring. Later, Orton took advantage in the match, as he applied a body scissors on Hardy, followed by a choke-hold. Some of the other main highlights of the match were Hardy performing a Whisper in the Wind on Orton; and, later executing a moonsault from the top-rope to Orton outside the ring. When Hardy brought Orton back in the ring and tried to deliver a Twist of Fate, Orton suddenly reversed it into an RKO and pinned Hardy to retain his WWE title.\nMain event.\nThe main event was the annual Royal Rumble match for a world championship match at WrestleMania XXIV; for the match, WWE was able to get Michael Buffer as a special guest ring announcer. The match began with The Undertaker and Shawn Michaels, who were the final two superstars in the previous year's Royal Rumble match. Undertaker and Michaels would both last over thirty minutes until Michaels eliminated Undertaker, only to be eliminated himself by Mr. Kennedy. Batista entered at number eight and would last the longest in the match at almost forty minutes. Hall of Famers Jimmy Snuka and Roddy Piper were both surprise entrants during the match, but both were eliminated by Kane. Hornswoggle, the ninth entrant, stayed hidden under the ring throughout most of the match (emerging once to help eliminate The Miz, the sixteenth entrant), however he was soon grabbed by Mark Henry and Big Daddy V, prompting Finlay to come out early and attack the two with his shillelagh. Finlay was disqualified for failing to wait for his entry number to be called and he left with Hornswoggle, who never returned. Triple H came out at number twenty-nine and scored the most eliminations with six. Afterwards, John Cena entered as the surprise thirtieth entrant, returning from a torn pectoral muscle injury months before his scheduled return. The ring soon cleared out and the final three came down to Batista, Triple H and Cena. The three would go back and forth trying to eliminate each other until Cena reversed a Batista Bomb attempt which allowed Triple H to eliminate Batista. Triple H and Cena were left as the final two and they traded moves for almost five minutes. The end came when Triple H attempted a Pedigree on Cena, but Cena reversed it and lifted Triple H up for an Attitude Adjustment, which he used to send Triple H over the top rope to eliminate him and win the match, earning the WrestleMania title shot. With this victory, Cena broke the record for spending the least amount of time in the rumble match before winning it, beating Brock Lesnar's 8:59 time by 31 seconds.\nAftermath.\nThe next night on \"Raw\", John Cena said that he did not want to wait until WrestleMania XXIV to face Randy Orton. The two agreed to face each other at No Way Out for the WWE Championship. In the match, Cena won after Orton intentionally got himself disqualified. As a result, Orton retained the title. At No Way Out, Triple H won Raw's Elimination Chamber match by last pinning Jeff Hardy after a Pedigree on a steel chair, earning the right to face Randy Orton for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania XXIV. At WrestleMania XXIV, Randy Orton retained the WWE Championship against Triple H and John Cena in a triple threat match.\nRey Mysterio received a rematch against Edge for the World Heavyweight Championship at No Way Out. Edge defeated Mysterio, who had suffered a biceps injury prior to the match. The Undertaker also won SmackDown's Elimination Chamber by pinning Batista last after a Tombstone Piledriver and earned the right to face Edge at WrestleMania XXIV. The Undertaker won the World Heavyweight title from Edge at WrestleMania XXIV via Submission using the Hell's Gate.\nThe Ric Flair retirement storyline continued as Flair defeated Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) that same week on \"SmackDown\" in a rematch, which he won by disqualification. He then faced Mr. Kennedy at No Way Out, defeating Kennedy to further extend his wrestling career. At WrestleMania XXIV, Flair lost to Shawn Michaels, ending Flair's career.\nDuring the 2008 WWE Draft, the WWE Championship and World Heavyweight Championship switched brands.\nResults.\nRoyal Rumble entrances and eliminations.\nHornswoggle spent most of the match under the ring before being forced into the ring by Mark Henry, who would then team up with Big Daddy V to assault him. Finlay, who was supposed to be the next scheduled entrant, came out early and attacked them both with his shillelagh and was immediately disqualified. He left the ring with Hornswoggle, who left through the ropes and never returned."

In addition, there are end zones extending another past the goal lines to the \"end lines\", for a total length of . When the \"football field\" is used as unit of measurement, it is usually understood to mean , although technically the full length of the official field, including the end zones, is . The total area of the field is . There is a goal centered on each end line, with a crossbar above the ground and goalposts apart (in college and the NFL) extending at least above the crossbar. Between the goal lines, additional lines span the width of the field at 5-yard intervals. This appearance led to the use of the term gridiron in the 1880s. For a few years in the early 20th century, lines perpendicular to the lines at 5-yard intervals spanned the length of the field, giving it a checkerboard-like appearance.\nThis article mainly describes the field used in the National Football League, college football, and other leagues playing the standard form of outdoor 11-man football. Other variants of American football such as nine-man or arena football typically use smaller fields with smaller end zones.\nField description.\nThe entire field is a rectangle long by wide; covering a total of 1.32 acres. The longer lines are the sidelines and the shorter lines are called end lines. NFL rules call for the sidelines and end lines to be wide, though the lines may be narrower on fields used for multiple sports or by college or amateur teams. In all cases the sidelines and end lines are measured along the inside edges of the boundary lines, and the lines themselves are out of bounds. Most distances on a football field are expressed in terms of yards.\nThe goal lines span the width of the field and run parallel to each end line. The 100 yards between the goal lines where most gameplay occurs is officially called the \"field of play\" in the NFL rulebook. Additional lines span the width of the field at 5-yard intervals from each goal line.\nEnd zones.\nThe areas at each end of the field between the goal lines and end lines – including the goal lines themselves – are called the end zones. The end zones are where touchdowns, two-point conversions, and safeties are scored, and where touchbacks occur. Orange weighted pylons mark the four corners of each end zone. Team or league logos or other patterns may be painted inside the end zone as long as they do not interfere with the mandatory field markings.\nGoals.\nA goal is centered on each end line, consisting of a horizontal crossbar above the ground and aligned with the inside edge of the end line, with vertical goal posts (colloquially \"uprights\") at each end of the crossbar apart and extending at least above the crossbar. The goals are where field goals (including rare fair catch kicks) and extra points after touchdowns are scored. All NFL fields and many collegiate and amateur fields have slingshot-shaped goal structures, with a single gooseneck-shaped support post anchored to the ground out of bounds. Other amateur fields, particularly at the high school level, may have H-shaped goal structures with two support posts anchored to the ground directly below the crossbar; on fields used for multiple sports these goals may double as soccer goals at the appropriate regulation width for that sport, along with the goal structure behind it and netting. The NFL requires a ribbon to be attached to the top of each goal post to indicate wind direction and speed. Goal posts must be yellow in the NFL unless waived due to extraordinary circumstances; collegiate fields may have yellow or white goal posts. Amateur fields may also have shorter goal posts or a wider space between the goal posts. Since 1974, NFL rules has the goalposts positioned at the end line; prior to that season, they were on the goal line (they have at the end line collegiately since 1927).\nYard lines.\nA yard line refers to the distance of some point on the 100-yard field of play – usually the line of scrimmage or the spot where a play ends – from the nearest goal line. When moving away from one goal line, the yard line numbers increase from 1 to 50 (midfield), then decrease back to 1 approaching the opposite goal line. Each yard line is said to \"belong\" to the team defending the closer end zone; for example, during a period where Team A is defending the north end zone and Team B is defending the south end zone, the 25-yard line closer to the north end zone is said to be Team A's 25-yard line.\nYard lines are identified with two rows of white numbers painted inside each sideline at 10-yard intervals (with some venues such as Tiger Stadium also marking 5-yard intervals, and some such as Sanford Stadium marking the goal line as \"G\"); the numbers 10 through 40 also include an arrow indicating the nearer goal line. NFL rules call for the bottom edge of each number to be 12 yards from the sideline. The yard lines are also identified at 10-yard intervals by orange markers placed outside the sidelines adjacent to the respective line. Yard lines other than multiples of 5 are marked by long, wide lines painted parallel to the goal lines at 1-yard intervals spanning the length of the field just inside each sideline as well as at the hash marks (see below).\nHash marks.\nThe \"hash marks\" (officially \"inbounds lines\" in the NFL rulebook) are two rows of short lines running the length of the field that mark the boundaries of where a scrimmage down may start. If the ball is downed outside the hash marks or run out of bounds, the next play begins at the hash mark closest to the spot where it is downed. In the NFL since 1972, the hash marks are from each sideline; in college football they are from each sideline. At each 5-yard line they are marked with lines painted parallel to the sidelines. Between the 5-yard lines they are marked with 2-foot lines painted perpendicular to the sidelines at 1-yard intervals. The hash marks are painted so that the edge farthest from the sideline is the required distance from the sideline.\nIn the NFL and most forms of indoor football, the hash marks are in line with the goalposts. College and high school football fields have hash marks that are significantly wider than the goal posts. The college football standard, which was the previous standard in the NFL (from to ), is 40 feet apart (20 yards from the sidelines), instituted in 1993. Previously, the college width was the same as the high school standard, at one-third of the width of the field (53 feet).\nOther markings.\nIn the NFL, a line is painted parallel to the goal line at the center of the 2-yard line; this denotes the line of scrimmage for a two-point conversion attempt (this was also the line of scrimmage for an extra point attempt prior to 2015); at the college level, this special hashmark is on the 3-yard line for an extra point attempt.\nA small X may be painted at the center of each 35-yard line on NFL or college fields to indicate the spot where kickoffs take place.\nMost professional and collegiate fields have a team or league logo painted at the 50-yard line. Special games such as the Super Bowl or college bowl games may have the event logo painted at the 50-yard line. These logos as well as any other non-mandatory field markings require league approval and may not interfere with mandatory field markings.\nDecorative yard lines, either at the 25-yard or 20-yard line, are common, usually featuring either team colors or American flag colors, and the 20-yard version indicates the start of the red zone.\nAccording to the high school rulebook recommendations, the field should be angled (or \"crowned\") at approximately 1.2° (rising inch per foot, or 1 in 48) upward from each sideline to the center of the field so that the center is higher than the sidelines, allowing proper drainage."

        "title": "Alamo City Rugby Football Club",
        "text": "The Alamo City Rugby Football Club (informally Alamo City RFC or Alamo City Rugby) is an American rugby union club that is based in San Antonio, Texas. Alamo City RFC plays in the Texas Rugby Union Men's Division 2 league. Home matches are held at the Bowie Field rugby pitches located inside Brooks Park in southeast San Antonio, TX. The nickname for Alamo City Rugby is \"The Defenders\".\nHistory.\nIn 1983, the Alamo City Rugby Football Club was started by a small group of players who were interested in promoting rugby in the city of San Antonio, Texas. Over the years, the club has grown to support high school, collegiate, masters (“old boys”), military, and currently, men's division II. A great achievement for the club was when the high school team received 2nd, 3rd, and 6th-place finishes in the National High School Championships. The fathering of the high school program helped the club achieve its 501(c)-3 status as a non-profit organization with exemption from state franchise and sales tax.\nIn 2001, Alamo City RFC expanded its club by starting a women's side, which formed by word of mouth through the men's club and local soccer leagues. Most of the women had little exposure to rugby prior to joining Alamo City RFC, but quickly adapted to the change in rules and techniques. The women's team ceased operations in 2007 due to a dwindling numbers restricting them from fielding a side.\nBowie Field.\nAnother one of the club's great accomplishments was obtaining the land for Bowie Field, which was named after Dr. Neil Bowie for his never-ending support to the club. The site has a regulation rugby playing pitch and a lighted practice pitch. The lighted practice pitch was named the Kevin Howell Memorial Pitch after the late Kevin Howell. This facility is San Antonio's first and only of its kind. It is located south of Brooks City-Base on Goliad Rd.\nCommunity involvement.\nACRFC contributes to the community of San Antonio by holding events and assisting in local charity fund raisers. The club has increased its ability to contribute to the community with their affiliation to the Harp and Shamrock Society, Target 90 Goals for San Antonio, and other local organizations. Alamo City RFC has an annual presence delivering toys to children in support of the San Antonio Elf Louise Program. GLI Distributing has also assisted by giving generous contributions to Alamo City RFC. In addition, ACRFC members donate their time to the San Antonio Food Bank.\nIn recent years, members of Alamo City Rugby have begun donating their time and money to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Specifically representing the Lone Star Chapter, ACRFC participates in the San Antonio CF Great Strides, and the CF Tower Climb. Participants will run a mile prior to running up the stairs of the Tower of the Americas in downtown San Antonio.\nIn 2015, ACRFC started participating in the Special Olympics Texas Fire Truck Pull. Members of ACRFC raise money for the entry fee and extra for the event, with all proceeds going to Special Olympics Texas. The event consists of 12 members to pull a fire truck 40 yards. The team with the fastest averaged time wins. With more than 20+ teams entered each year, ACRFC has won the competition in 2015 and in 2016. https://web.archive.org/web/20161202040800/http://www.alamocityrfc.com/2015-special-olympics-fire-truck-pull\nBeginning in 2010, a few members of ACRFC began donating their time coaching the reinvigorated collegiate rugby programs of the University of Texas at San Antonio UTSA Roadrunners and St. Mary's University, Texas Rattler Rugby.\nFiesta 7s Tournament.\nIn the spring of 1984, Alamo City RFC joined the Fiesta San Antonio Commission, and has since hosted the Alamo City Rugby Fiesta 7s Tournament annually. The Fiesta 7s tournament is held each spring in April during “Fiesta San Antonio”. Rugby sevens is played at the Fiesta Tournament, and is usually played in some type of round-robin tournament format. Teams from across Texas, and the nation, participate. In addition, teams from Europe, such as British Caldonia, Twickingham, Imber Court, England's Royal Engineers, Ireland's Arklow, and The Old Hirelings of France have traveled to San Antonio and played in the tournament.\nCommandant's Cup Trophy.\nAlthough the Fiesta Tournament is a rugby sevens tournament, Alamo City RFC invites three of the United States military academies (United States Air Force Academy, United States Naval Academy, and the United States Military Academy) to participate in a round-robin tournament for the Commandant's Cup. Each military academy enters a full rugby union (15-a side) team to compete for the cup.\nExternal links.\n "

        "text": "Charles Albert Taylor (January 24, 1920 – May 7, 1994) was an American football player, coach, and college athletics administrator. He played college football at Stanford University from 1940 to 1942, returned as head football coach from 1951 to 1957, and served as the school's athletic director from 1963 to 1971. During his coaching tenure at Stanford, Taylor compiled a 40–29–2 record and led the Indians to the 1952 Rose Bowl his first season. That same season, at the age of 31, Taylor was named AFCA Coach of the Year, the youngest recipient of the award ever.\nAs a sophomore, Taylor was one of the \"Wow Boys\" on the undefeated 1940 Stanford Indians football team and played in Stanford's 1941 Rose Bowl victory over Nebraska. As a senior in 1942, he was an All-American guard. Taylor was selected in the fourth round of the 1943 NFL Draft by the Cleveland Rams.\nBy coaching his team to the 1952 Rose Bowl, Taylor became the second person to have participated in the Rose Bowl Game both as a player and a head coach. The first was Wallace Wade who played for Brown in the 1916 bowl game and coached Alabama in 1926,1927 and 1931. Wade also coached Duke University in the Rose Bowl (1939 and 1941). Only six other men have accomplished this feat since Taylor.\nAfter leaving coaching in 1957, Taylor returned to Stanford in 1963 as athletic director, where he served until 1971, when Stanford played in the 1971 Rose Bowl, giving him the distinction of being only one of two men who has participated in a Rose Bowl Game as a player, coach, and athletic director. The other man is Jess Hill of USC, who played in the 1930 Rose Bowl, coached in the 1953 and 1955 Rose Bowls, and was athletic director for the 1963, 1967, 1968, 1969, and 1970 Rose Bowls.\nFor many years Taylor and his wife also directed a camp for young people in the coastal range of Northern California near Santa Cruz, called \"Mountain Camp\", where hundreds of young people enjoyed two-week sessions with unlimited recreation and character-building activities.\nHis youngest daughter, Janet Ann Taylor, was 21 when she was murdered near the Stanford campus on March 24, 1974. Confirmed serial killer John Getreu was convicted of her murder in September 2021."

        "title": "Fencing rules",
        "text": "Fencing practice and techniques of modern competitive fencing are governed by the \"Fédération Internationale d'Escrime\" (FIE), though they developed from conventions developed in 18th- and 19th-century Europe to govern fencing as a martial art and a gentlemanly pursuit. The modern weapons for sport fencing are the foil, épée, and sabre.\nPlaying area.\nA fencing bout takes place on a strip, or \"piste\", which, according to the current FIE regulations, should be between wide and long. There are two \"en-garde\" lines (where the fencers stand at the beginning of the bout) either side of the midpoint. There are also two warning lines two metres from either end of the strip, to provide retreating fencers knowledge of their position on the \"piste\". Retreating off of the strip scores a touch for the opponent.\nParticipants.\nThere are at least three people involved: two fencers and a referee, formerly called a \"director\" or \"president of the jury\". The referee may be assisted by a jury of two or four \"line-judges\". The primary job of this jury was to watch for hits scored, however the arrival of the electronic scoring apparatus has rendered them largely redundant. Under current FIE rules, a fencer may ask for two side-judges (one to watch each fencer) if they think that the referee is failing to notice some infringement of the rules on their opponent's part such as use of the unarmed hand, substitution of the valid target area, breaching the boundary of the \"piste\" etc.\nProtocol and rules.\nThe referee stands at the side of the piste. The fencers walk on piste fully dressed, aside from the mask. If necessary, they plug their body wires into the spools connected to the electronic scoring apparatus and test their weapons against each other, to make sure everything is functioning. They then retreat to their en-garde lines.\nPrior to starting a bout, the fencers must salute each other. Refusal to do so can result in a fencer's suspension or disqualification. Both fencers must salute each other and the referee. They may choose to salute the audience. In non-electric events the four judges should also be saluted. There are many variations of the salute, including some fairly theatrical ones, but the common theme is that the fencer stands upright, mask off, facing whomever they are saluting and raises their sword to a vertical position with the guard either at or just below face level, and then lowers it again. Various apocryphal stories about the origin of the salute circulate, like gladiators saluting each other in the arena, crusaders pointing their sword heavenward in pre-battle prayer, duellists showing each other that their swords are the same length, etc. The most likely source of the modern fencing salute is the \"Present arms\" command from military drill, which originated in the 16th century.\nAfter the salutes are completed, the referee will call \"En garde!\" The fencers put on their masks and adopt the fencing stance with the front foot behind the en-garde line and, in foil, with the blade in the sixte line. They are now in the on-guard (\"en garde\") position. The referee then calls \"Ready?\" In some countries, the fencers are required to confirm that they are. Finally the referee will call \"Fence!\", and the bout will start. Judging is often done in French, in which case the referee will say \"En garde! Prêts? Allez!\" or, if both fencers are female, \"En garde! Prêtes? Allez!\" (In some circles, beginning the bout with the order \"fence\" is deemed incorrect, but in others the use of \"play\" is discouraged due to the phonetic similarity with the French \"prêts\". The use of \"fence\" is contrary to the rules in certain countries.)\nThis is the start of a \"phrase\" i.e. an any unbroken chain of recognizable offensive and defensive actions, such as lunging or parrying performed by the two fencers. The phrase ends when a referee has reason to stop the bout, such as \"corps a corps\" (the action of two fencers coming into physical contact with one another with any portion of their bodies or hilts), a hit (on or off-target), or a penalty, or when both fencers return to passivity. To interrupt the bout the referee calls \"Halt!\" (if judging in French, the term is \"Halte!\", pronounced like \"Halt!\" in English), a bout may be interrupted for several reasons: a touch has been made, the rules have been breached, the situation is unsafe, or the action has become so disorganized that the referee can no longer follow it. Once the bout is stopped, the referee will, if necessary, explain their reasons for stopping it, analyze what has just happened and award points or give out penalties.\nIf a point has been awarded, then the competitors return to their en-garde lines; if not, they remain approximately where they were when the bout was interrupted. The referee will then restart the bout as before. If the fencers were within lunging distance when the bout was interrupted and they are not required to return to their en-garde lines, the referee will ask both fencers to give sufficient ground to ensure a fair start. A common way of establishing the correct distance is to ask both fencers to straighten their arms and to step back to the point where their blades no longer overlap in the referee's view. If a fencer needs to stop the bout to adjust their mask or tie their shoe, or something else requires the referee's attention, they may do so by tapping their back foot and/or waving their back hand and the referee will generally call a halt. Tapping the front foot is called an \"appel\" and is actually a tactical move, intended to distract the opposing fencer; thus, the referee may ignore a front-foot tap.\nThis procedure is repeated until either one of the fencers has reached the required number of points (generally, 1, 5, or 15, depending on the format of the bout) or until the time allowed for the bout runs out.\nFencing bouts are timed: the clock is started every time the referee calls \"Allez\" and stopped every time they call \"Halt!\". The bout must stop after three minutes of fencing (or 8 touches in saber). In 15 point bouts, a 1-minute break occurs in between the three-minute intervals. If 9 minutes of fencing time elapse in a 15 touch bout, or 3 in a 5 touch bout, the bout is over and the current scores are taken as final. If the score is tied when time runs out then the director determines priority randomly. After priority is determined the fencers bout for one minute. If a point is scored, then that fencer wins, however if no points are scored then the fencer with priority wins. Note that this concept of priority is not the same as the priority used in foil and sabre to determine right-of-way.\nSince July 1, 2020 (and reconfirmed by FIE public notice in September 2020 and in January 2021), by public written notice the FIE had replaced its previous handshake requirement with a \"salute\" by the opposing fencers, and written in its public notice that handshakes were \"suspended until further notice.\"\nAfter the Olga Kharlan handshaking incident in 2023, the International Fencing Federation changed its rules so that the previously required handshakes between fencers at the end of a bout would become optional, with a distance greeting permitted instead.\nPriority (\"Right of way\").\nFoil and sabre are governed by priority rules, according to which fencer first initiated a correctly executed attack, as described in the following paragraphs. When both fencers hit more or less simultaneously, only the fencer who had priority receives the point. If priority cannot be assigned unambiguously, no points are awarded. These rules were adopted in the 18th century as part of teaching practice. Their aim is to encourage \"sensible\" fencing and reward initiative and circumspection at the same time, in particular, to reward fencers for properly made attacks, and penalize fencers for attacking into such an attack that lands, an action that could be lethal with sharp blades. The risk of both duelists charging onto one another's swords is kept to a minimum. At least in principle, in a prolonged phrase, the initiative passes smoothly from one fencer to the other, and back again, and so on. In practice, most phrases are broken off quickly if neither fencer lands.\nPenalties.\nModern fencing also includes the addition of penalty cards or flags. Each card has a different meaning. A fencer penalized with a yellow card is warned, but no other action is taken. A fencer penalized with a red card is warned, and a touch is awarded to their opponent. A fencer penalized with a black card is excluded from the competition, and may be excluded from the tournament, expelled from the venue, or suspended from future tournaments in the case of serious offenses. . Additionally, spectators can be (and occasionally are) carded or expelled.\nOffenses are broken down into four groups, and penalties are assessed based upon the group of the offense.\nThere is also a specific penalty for putting one or both feet off the side edge of the piste: halt is called, and the opponent may then advance one meter towards the penalized fencer. The penalized fencer must retreat to 'normal' distance before the bout can restart - that is, the distance where both fencers can stand on-guard, with their arms and swords extended directly at their opponent, and their blades do not cross. If this puts the fencer beyond the back edge of the piste, the fencer's opponent receives a point.\nScoring.\nNon-electronic scoring.\nPrior to the introduction of electronic scoring equipment, the president of jury was assisted by four judges. Two judges were positioned behind each fencer, one on each side of the strip. The judges watched the fencer opposite to see if he was hit. This system is sometimes called \"dry\" fencing (USA) or \"steam\" (United Kingdom, Australia) fencing.\nWhen any of the judges thinks they saw a hit, that judge raises their hand. The president (referee or director) then stops the bout and reviews the relevant phases of the action, polling the judges at each stage to determine whether there was a touch, and (in foil and sabre) whether the touch was valid or invalid. The judges answer \"Yes\", \"Yes, but off-target\" (in foil and sabre), \"No\", or \"Abstain\". Each judge has one vote, and the president has one and a half votes. Thus, two judges could overrule the president; but if the judges disagreed, or if one judge abstained, the president's opinion rules.\nÉpée fencing was later conducted with red dye on the tip, easily seen on the white uniform. As a bout went on, if a touch was seen, a red mark would appear. Between the halts of the director, judges would inspect each fencer for any red marks. Once one was found, it was circled in a dark pencil to show that it had already been counted. The red dye was not easily removed, preventing any cheating. The only way to remove it was through certain acids such as vinegar.\nNon-electronic scoring methods were plagued by uncertain rulings, due to the small points of the weapons, the speed at which the sport was played, and obscuring movements from the fencers. In addition there were frequent problems with bias and collusion, leading to the wry expression that a dry jury consisted of \"4 blind men and a thief\". Some fencers, particularly in sabre, would hit hard to ensure their touches could not be missed, and dry sabre could be an extremely painful undertaking despite the protective jackets. Even in the best of circumstances, it was very difficult to accurately score hits, and it systematically under-reported valid touches to hard-to-see areas, such as the back or flank under the arm.\nElectronic scoring.\nElectronic scoring is used in all major national and international, and most local, competitions. At Olympic level, it was first introduced to épée in 1936, to foil in 1956, and to sabre in 1988.\nThe central component of the scoring system is commonly known as \"the box\". In the simplest version both fencers' weapons are connected to the box via long retractable cables. The box normally carries a set of lights to signal when a touch has been made. (Larger peripheral lights are also often used.) In foil and sabre, because of the need to distinguish on-target hits from off-target ones, special conductive clothing and wires must be worn. This includes a lamé, (a jacket of conducting cloth) for both weapons, a body cord to connect the weapon to the system, a reel of retractable cable that connects to the scoring box and in the case of sabre, a conducting mask and cuff (manchette) as the head and arms are valid target areas.\nRecently, reel-less gear has been adopted for all weapons at top competitions. In this system, which eliminates the spool (by using the fencer's own body as a grounding point), the lights and detectors are mounted directly on the fencers' masks. For the sake of the audience, clearly visible peripheral lights triggered by wireless transmission may be used. However, the mask lights must remain as the official indicators because FIE regulations prohibit the use of wireless transmitters in official scoring equipment in order to prevent cheating. The development of reel-less scoring apparatus in épée and foil has been much slower due to technical complications. The first international competitions to use the reel-less versions of these weapons were held in 2006.\nIn the case of foil and épée, hits are registered by depressing a small push-button on the end of the blade. In foil, the hit must land on the opponent's lame to be considered on-target. (On-target hits set off coloured lights; off-target hits set off white lights.) At high level foil and épée competitions, grounded conductive pistes are normally laid down to ensure that bouts are not disrupted by accidental hits on the floor. In sabre, an on-target hit is registered whenever a fencer's blade comes into contact with the opponent's lamé jacket, cuff or mask. Off-target hits are not registered at all in sabre. It has been proposed that a similar arrangement (non-registration of off-target hits) be adopted for foil. This proposal is due to be reviewed at the 2007 FIE Congress. In épée the entire body is on-target, so the subject of off-target hits does not arise (unless one counts the hits which miss the opponent entirely and land on an ungrounded section of the floor - needless to say doing so on purpose is considered cheating). Finally the competitors' weapons are always grounded so hits against an opponent's blade or coquille do not register.\nIn foil and sabre, despite the presence of all the gadgetry, it is still the referee's job to analyze the phrase and, in the case of simultaneous hits, to determine which fencer had the right of way.\nCriticism of electronic scoring.\nOne of the most common criticisms of electronic scoring has been the registration of glancing hits in foil. Traditionally, a valid, \"palpable\" hit could only be scored, if the point were fixed on the target in such a manner, as would be likely to pierce the skin, had the weapon been sharp. However, the electric foil point (the push-button on the end of the blade) lacks directionality, so hits which arrive at a very high angle of incidence can still register. \nFlicking.\nIn the 1980s, this led to a growing popularity of hits delivered with a whip-like action (commonly known as \"the flick\"), bending the blade around the opponent's parry. Many saw this as an unacceptable deviation from tradition. In fact, the disputes over the flick grew so bitter that a number of traditionalists advocated (and still continue to advocate) complete abandonment of electronic scoring as something detrimental to fencing as an art. \nTiming changes.\nIn 2004-2005 the FIE brought in rule changes to address concerns over flicking. The dwell time (the length of time the point has to remain depressed in order to register a hit) was increased from 1 millisecond to 15 milliseconds. While this did not eliminated the flick altogether, it made it technically trickier thereby denting its popularity. However, there have been issues with apparently \"palpable\" hits not registering. Moreover, the imperative to make clear \"square-on\" hits has led to a number of unforeseen results. The following have been reported:\nThe issue of unwillingness to attack was addressed by the FIE with the “Unwillingness to Fight” rule in 2019, which implemented penalties for inactivity and was first used at the Olympics during the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. This Unwillingness to Fight rule dictated that when a minute elapses without a point, the fencer who is behind receives a yellow card, and multiple offenses would warrant a red card. The rationale behind this ruling was that directing penalties towards one fencer would grant incentive for the fencer who was behind to play more aggressively, as they had more to lose by playing passively.\nIn sabre, the inadequacy of existing sensors has made it necessary to dispense with the requirement that a cut must be delivered with either the leading or the reverse edge of the blade and that, once again, it must arrive with sufficient force to have caused an injury had the blade been sharp (but not so forcefully as to injure one's opponent with a blunt weapon.) At present, any contact between the blade and the opponent's target is counted as a valid hit. Some argue that this has reduced sabre to a two-man game of tag; others argue that this has made the game more sophisticated.\nThe other serious problem in sabre is that of \"whip-over.\" The flexibility of the blades is such that the momentum of a cut can often \"whip\" the end of the blade around the defender's parry. The low success rate of parries (compared to other weapons) is seen by many as impoverishing the tactical repertory of the weapon. In 2000 the FIE brought in rule changes requiring stiffer blades. This has improved matters but not eradicated the problem altogether. There has been talk of making the sabre guard smaller, in order to make attacks on preparation and counterattacks easier and thus slow down the momentum of the attack, giving the defender more of a chance.\nThe cutout time is the maximum time allowed by the box between two hits registering as simultaneous (if this time is exceeded, only one light will appear). In épée this time is very short: 40 milliseconds. This means that, so far as human perception is concerned, the hits really do need to arrive at the same instant. In foil and sabre, where priority rules apply, the cutout times are considerably longer (hundreds of milliseconds). This was a source of two problems:\nFor those reasons, in 2004-2005 the FIE slashed the cut-out times for foil and sabre from 750 milliseconds to 350 milliseconds and from 350 milliseconds to 120 milliseconds respectively. In 2016 the lockout timing for sabre was again modified to increase the lockout time from 120 milliseconds to 170 milliseconds +/- 10ms, while the foil and epee lockout times remained unchanged.\nTechniques.\nBladework.\nThe nine classical parries comprise basic bladework. The first parry that most fencers learn is \"quarte\", known commonly as \"parry four\". Parries are named for the \"line\" that they defend from attack: parry four would defend line four, which is the high inside line. Offensive bladework consists of the various means of scoring a touch on an opponent. The straight attack is a direct extension towards valid target. As it is easily defended against, fencers often use numerous feints to deceive their opponent into parrying and then disengage around the blade. As a preparation for an attack, fencers may execute a prise de fer, or attack on the blade. This includes the simple \"beat\", a sharp rap on the opponent's blade, and the more complex \"bind\", in which the fencer forces the opponent's blade to a different line.\nFootwork.\nIn a fencing bout, a great deal depends on being in the right place at the right time. Fencers are constantly maneuvering in and out of each other's range, accelerating, decelerating, changing directions and so on. All this has to be done with minimum effort and maximum grace, which makes footwork arguably the most important aspect of a fencer's training regimen. In contemporary sport fencing defense by footwork usually takes the shape of moving either directly away from your opponent or directly towards them.\nThe most common way of delivering an attack in fencing is the lunge, where the fencer reaches out with their front foot and straightens their back leg. This maneuver has the advantage of allowing the fencer to maintain balance while covering far more distance than in a single step, yet allowing a return to the defensive stance.\nCompetition.\nFencing tournaments are varied in their format, and there are both individual and team competitions. A tournament may comprise all three weapons, both individual and team, or it may be more specific, such as an Épée Challenge, with individual épée only. As in many sports, men and women compete separately.\nIndividual events.\nGenerally, an individual event consists of two parts: the pools, and the direct eliminations.\nIn the pools, fencers are divided into groups, and every fencer in a pool will have the chance to fence every other fencer once. The size and number of the pools is determined by the number of athletes who have registered for the competition.\nPool bouts are three minutes long, and are fenced to five points. If no fencer reaches five points, then the one with the most points after three minutes wins. Pool results are recorded on a scoresheet, which must be signed by the fencers after their last match. The referee will write down how many points each fencer scored in the bout, although normally if a fencer won with five points a \"V\" (for \"victoire\") is written down instead of a 5. Losing a pool match does not eliminate a fencer from the tournament.\nIn some tournaments, there are two rounds of pools, with the second round following the same format, but with pools of different fencers.\nAfter the pools are finished, the direct elimination round starts. Fencers are sorted in a table of some power of 2 (16, 32, 64, etc.) based on how many people are competing. There are rarely exactly the right number of people for this to work out perfectly, so the lowest ranking fencers may be eliminated, or they may be included in the next highest power of 2 with the top fencers receiving a bye.\nOnce the table size has been chosen, fencers are slotted into the table like this: first place vs. last place, second vs. second last, third vs. third last etc. A fencers place is decided by three factors: their victories divided by matches fenced, their indicator score, which is calculated by the numbers of hits for and against during the pool rounds, and finally their hits scored. If there is no way of separating the fencers beyond these three indicators, then they are considered equal and draw random lots for their place in the table.\nThe elimination round matches in foil and épée are fenced in three periods of three minutes each. In between each period, there is a one-minute break. Sabre matches are so much faster that the three-minute mark is almost never reached. Therefore, in sabre, when one fencer reaches 8 points, there is a one-minute break.\nIn all three weapons, the match goes until 15 points. If no one has reached 15 points, then the fencer with the most points wins. The rules for ties are explained above under Protocol. The winner carries on in the tournament, and loser is eliminated.\nFencing is slightly unusual in that no one has to fence for third place. Instead, two bronze medals are given to the losers of the semi-final round. The exception to this is team events at international level, and individual events at the Olympic Games where a 3rd place play-off must be fenced.\nTeam events.\nTeam competition involves teams of three fencers. A fourth fencer can be allowed on the team as an alternate, but as soon as the fourth has been subbed in, they cannot leave again. The opposing team must be alerted of this substitution at least one round before it happens.\nThe modern team competition is similar to the pool round of the individual competition. The fencers from opposing teams will each fence each other once, making for a total of nine matches. At the beginning of the team match, each team fills out one side of a score sheet with the order they will fence in. Teams are not aware of the order their opponents will be fencing in, although the sheet is designed so that no two athletes will fence each other twice.\nMatches between teams are three minutes long, or to 5 points, as in the pools. There are important differences, however: each match the score carries over, and the maximum score for each match is increased by 5. The maximum score for each round continues increasing by 5 regardless of how many points were scored in the previous match. Because there are 9 matches, the highest score possible is 45 points. While sabre almost inevitably goes to 45, it is not unusual to see an épée score in the mid to low thirties. If there is a tie at the end of the ninth match, then the usual tie-breaking rules apply, and it is the same two fencers who will do the tie-breaker match.\nTeam tournaments sometimes use pools and elimination rounds, although given the possible length of a team match (often a half-hour each), this is not so common, and they usually begin in a direct elimination format. The seeding of the teams in this case can be random, or based on the performance of the individual members (if it is a tournament with both), or even based on the results of the same team at other tournaments (for example if it is a national team). Unlike individual tournaments, teams must almost always fence for bronze.\nThere is also an older team format, no longer in popular use. Under these rules, the teams were still three members each, and still consisted of nine matches round-robin tournament style. However, scores did not carry over. The team to first win 5 matches (a majority) was declared the winner."

        "title": "The Fencing Master",
        "text": "The Fencing Master is a 1988 novel by Arturo Pérez-Reverte set in Spain at the middle of the 19th century. Amid the political turmoil of the Glorious Revolution where conspiracy and intrigue are commonplace, fencing master Don Jaime Astarloa tries to live as he always has. Subsisting on meager funds gained through teaching fencing to the sons of the nobility, the anachronistic Don Jaime lives by one universal code: \"to be honest, or at least honorable--anything, indeed, that has its roots in the word honor.\"\n\"The Fencing Master\" is presented in the third person with the focus on the protagonist.\nHistorical references.\nThe historical context of the novel is similar to what actually occurred in the Glorious Revolution of Spain. Much of the speculation by characters in the novel revolve around General Juan Prim, who did indeed lead the revolution. The events, too, were taken from actual historical record. A concierge, at one point, mentions to Don Jaime that the navy has rebelled in Cadiz, which actually occurred when Admiral Juan Bautista Topete mutinied. Some characters speculated on Francisco Serrano, who eventually became regent. Some discussions in the book run contrary to historical fact, such as Carreño's guess that Baldomero Espartero would become regent. Although this did not occur, Espartero was a significant enough man that it would not be out of the question if he did assume the post.\nEven much of the talk about Queen Isabella II had some basis in fact. Luis de Ayala and Minister Marfori are said to have had intimate relations with the Queen, which is wholly possible due to her alleged nymphomania.\nPlot summary.\nPrologue.\nA minister, later revealed to be Joaquin Vallespin Andreu, uncle of Luis de Ayala, meets with an apparently wealthy blackmailer. Shortly, money and an envelope full of \"names and addresses\" changes hands, and the scene ends with a reference to the historical time frame, 1866 during the reign of Queen Isabel.\nChapter 1: The Fencing Bout.\nLuis de Ayala is a friend of Don Jaime Astarloa, a fencing master, who fences with him every morning. One day after fencing, they talk over glasses of sherry from Andalusia.\nThe subsequent discussion reveals that Luis de Ayala has apparently resolved to abstain from politics despite invitations to resume his post. Luis de Ayala's weakness for love is revealed, as is his propensity for gambling. Later, Luis mentions a Holy Grail, which turns out to be the \"Treatise on the Art of Fencing,\" that Don Jaime is working on. The depth of Don Jaime's passion for fencing is revealed by a description of the lengths to which he has gone in search of an \"unstoppable thrust\" that is impossible to parry, which he is not sure even exists.\nDon Jaime spends his time teaching fencing to the sons of the nobility. Since firearms are becoming more prevalent over swords, the fencing master has only a few students left. He repeatedly praises the pupils in front of their parents, often making gross exaggerations about their talent in order to retain his clients. He is serious about teaching his students, reprimanding them when they treat fencing as a sport instead of a combat art. Tired, he takes a break and heads to the Café Progreso to meet with his discussion group.\nThe microcosm of Don Jaime's discussion group, which meets at the Café Progreso, serves as a foil to Don Jaime. Cárceles the liberal and Don Lucas the conservative quarrel perpetually over politics, which Don Jaime does not care about. Romero, a music teacher, is similar to Don Jaime in that they are both teachers, and both harbour memories of love. However, Don Jaime teaches only males while Romero teaches at a school for girls. Also, Romero lacks the courage to make his love known. Finally, Carreño shares none of Don Jaime's honor, flaunting wild political theories as fact in order to gain attention.\nThe first chapter ends with a fencing lesson in which Don Jaime tries to convince his students that swordplay is useful. Rejecting the claim that fencing is just a sport, and denouncing firearms as a weapon of \"vile highwaymen,\" he muses about the ethics and mysticism of fencing. When faced with the claim that fencing masters will one day cease to exist, he laments that with them will die \"all that is noble and honorable about [battle].\"\nChapter 2: Compound Attack with Two Feints.\nDon Jaime receives a note to meet a certain Adela de Otero in her home. Upon his arrival, he finds that Adela is not what he expected. He is fascinated with her, paying attention to certain characteristics that he finds odd, such as short fingernails and a small scar near her mouth. She asks him to teach her a secret \"two hundred Escudo\" thrust, and he declines with finality, becoming angry when she offers additional money. Later, Adela visits Don Jaime in his own home. At first, he receives her with stiff politeness but she proves herself to be knowledgeable about fencing. After a verbal test, which she passes, Astarloa agrees to teach her the secret thrust.\nAt night, Don Jaime resumes his quest to find the unstoppable thrust. After working on paper, he eventually goes into the fencing gallery to test his theories. As the clock strikes three, Don Jaime begins to doubt the possibility of an unstoppable thrust, hearkening back to the words of his old master. This daydream takes him back to the beginning of his fencing career, in the army. He recalls killing a fellow soldier over a girl, as well as other duels he fought as he learned fencing. In the end of his reflections, he concludes that Adela has come into his life too late.\nChapter 3: Uncertain Time on a False Attack.\nAdela de Otero arrives at Don Jaime's home for her fencing lesson. She impresses him by requesting that their first bout be fenced without masks. During their bout, he makes a few comments about her excellent technique, though she soon becomes angry when she realizes that he is not fencing to win. After an aggressive barrage of attacks from Adela, Don Jaime disarms her. In their subsequent bouts, Don Jaime is forced to use all his skill to avoid being hit, and is forced to hit his opponent or receive a touch himself. This leads to a rising respect for his opponent, evidenced by his compliments after the bout and the extended exchange they share about his history. De Otero, on the other hand, refuses to divulge anything about her own past.\nChapter 4: The Short Lunge.\nDon Jaime is with his group of friends at Café Progreso. Don Lucas and Cárceles, monarchist and republican respectively, argue heatedly while Carreño and Romero step in occasionally. Cárceles blames Queen Isabella and her continual vacillation between liberal and conservative positions for the country's troubles, and warns the others that opposition to her rule is beginning to cross party lines. Don Jaime remains detached from the conversation, until commotion outside forces him to investigate. He returns with the information that several generals have been arrested and taken to a military prison.\nLater, back in his home, Astarloa teaches Adela de Otero his secret thrust. She learns it quickly, astutely remarking about its simplicity. After asking whether the fencing master had taught it to anyone else, she inquires whether he has ever killed anyone with this thrust. He refuses to answer, silently recalling the image of a man he had killed when he was still a soldier.\nDuring his next session with Luis de Ayala, he tells the marquis about Adela. De Ayala takes immediate interest, and seeks to arrange a meeting. Don Jaime glazes over this request, though he denies any interest other than a professional relationship between him and Adela. The conversation takes a turn into politics for a moment, but the focus quickly turns onto Don Jaime himself, when Don Jaime reveals his own personal values with an emphasis on honor.\nAfter a few ordinary lessons, Don Jaime finds himself in intimate conversation with Adela. He lets the conversation continue until he feels that he is no longer thinking clearly, at which point he ends the talk and escorts Adela home. While they ride in the carriage together, Adela requests that he let her meet with Luis de Ayala. Reluctantly, he agrees. At the next lesson, the marquis meets with Adela and arranges to meet her, excluding Don Jaime. Soon after, Adela sends a letter thanking him for the lessons and dismissing him from his service.\nSeveral evenings later, Don Jaime sees Adela with a mysterious stranger. They leave as soon as Adela sees him. That night, Don Jaime dreams of a doll missing its eyes. One morning, Luis de Ayala uncharacteristically refuses to fence Don Jaime, citing an unsteady hand. He tells Don Jaime that the fencing master is the only man he can trust, and gives him a sealed envelope for safekeeping.\nChapter 5: Glissade.\nGeneral Prim has begun the revolution and the navy has rebelled. The political atmosphere is in turmoil, evidenced by the newfound vigor with which the group at Café Progreso argues. Don Jaime remains impassive, teaching fencing as usual. Even when there is a small riot outside, he chastises his students for being distracted, lecturing them once again on the importance of tradition.\nOne morning, Luis de Ayala is found dead in his home. When Don Jaime goes to visit for their daily fencing, he is brought in and interrogated. At the crime scene, he noticed with dismay the cause of death: a foil wound in the throat, characteristic of the secret thrust that he had taught Adela. He volunteers little information during the session, eventually suggesting that the police visit Adela de Otero. Campillo, the investigator, informs him that Adela has disappeared.\nChapter 6: An Attack on the Blade.\nFeeling betrayed that his own thrust would be put to murderous use, Don Jaime tries to analyze the crime. He concludes that de Ayala must have been killed for the papers that he had given earlier in a sealed envelope to Don Jaime. He goes home and begins reading the letters, finding nothing but lists of names and a strange reference to silver mines. Unable to deduce a motive for killing de Ayala, Don Jaime decides to obtain the help of someone well versed in Spanish politics. He finds Cárceles at Café Progreso and persuades him to help. While Cárceles is in the middle of a discovery, Campillo knocks on the door.\nInformed that he must go with the police, Astarloa leaves Cárceles temporarily with the documents. He is taken to the morgue, where he is shown the mutilated body of what seems to be Adela de Otero. The corpse is wearing Adela's ring, and looks similar to Adela, leading Don Jaime to believe that it is the body of his former student.\nChapter 7: The Appel.\nAgain, Don Jaime is interrogated, but volunteers little information. He learns that he is under surveillance, due to his having a link to two murders, and that Adela's maid, Lucia, has been dismissed. He leaves, resolving to avenge Adela. Don Jaime returns to his home to find that Cárceles is missing. He forces entry into Cárceles' home, only to find his friend strapped into his bed, tortured out of his mind with a mass of razor cuts. In the darkness, he is ambushed by two assassins. Armed with his cane-sword, he deals two stab wounds to one and breaks the nose of the other. The assassins escape the watchmen, leaving Don Jaime again to answer Campillo's questions.\nSeeing that he has made a mistake in keeping information from the police, Don Jaime tells Campillo everything that he knows. While the policeman is disappointed in Don Jaime's naivety, he is impressed with his courage. Cárceles dies in the hospital from his wounds, and Don Jaime is allowed to go. Campillo warns him to keep his weapon close, since he is now the last link in the crimes.\nChapter 8: With Bare Blades.\nThough certain now that his life is in danger, Don Jaime decides not to flee the country. He sits by the door to his home with his gun and cane-sword, waiting for his inevitable assailant. After several false starts, someone finally arrives. It is Adela de Otero. He discovers the secret letter, which was dropped when he initially opened the envelope. The secret of a man named Cazorla Longo, who presumably engineered the murders, is revealed. Adela tries to no avail to get the letter, eventually attempting to seduce Don Jaime and then stab him with a hairpin. After the attempt fails, Adela de Otero picks up the cane sword and attacks.\nPursued into the gallery, Don Jaime searches futilely for a weapon. Eventually, he settles for a blunted practice foil. The ensuing duel leaves Don Jaime wounded in his side. Finally, Don Jaime employs a redoublement, cutting over Adela's arm for a lethal thrust through her eye into her brain. The end of the novel finds Don Jaime standing before his mirror, still searching for the perfect, unstoppable thrust.\nFilm.\n\"The Fencing Master\" (1992) produced by Antonio Cardenal and Pedro Olea was based on Pérez-Reverte's original story."

        "text": "Joseph Patrick Murphy (born October 16, 1967) is a Canadian former professional hockey player who was chosen first overall in the 1986 NHL Entry Draft. Murphy won Calder Cup and NCAA championships before reaching the NHL.\nAlthough Murphy struggled to make the expected impact after being selected first overall by the Detroit Red Wings, he was traded to the Edmonton Oilers in 1989. His production began to increase significantly in the 1990 playoffs to help Edmonton win their fifth Stanley Cup in seven seasons, and this success continued through his time in Edmonton. A contract dispute led to a trade to the Chicago Blackhawks in 1993, where he remained very productive. Murphy's later years were spent with the St. Louis Blues, San Jose Sharks, Boston Bruins, and Washington Capitals.\nPlaying career.\nDetroit Red Wings.\nJoe Murphy became the first NCAA college player to be selected first overall when he was selected in the 1986 NHL Entry Draft by the Detroit Red Wings. Murphy had been a stand out centre with Michigan State, but with Steve Yzerman and Adam Oates handling the first and second line duties in Detroit, Murphy found little room to develop his game with the Red Wings. He spent the bulk of his rookie pro season in the American Hockey League with the Wings farm club in Adirondack.\nThe following season Murphy split time between the AHL and the NHL playing fifty games with Detroit after converting to right wing. He managed just ten goals and 19 points and ended up back in the minor leagues for the majority of the 1988-89 season where he really found his game putting up 31 goals and 66 points in just 47 games. That spring Murphy played a key role for the Adirondack Red Wings capturing the Calder Cup to complete his breakout pro season. The next season, 1989–90, Murphy scored three goals in the first nine games of the season for the Red Wings. He was then shipped to the Edmonton Oilers as part of a blockbuster six-player trade that landed Jimmy Carson and Kevin McClelland with the Red Wings and sent Murphy, Adam Graves, Petr Klíma and Jeff Sharples to Edmonton.\nEdmonton Oilers and Chicago Blackhawks.\nWith the Oilers, Murphy joined a young and up-and-coming core, but his development seemed to stall with just seven goals and 25 points in 62 games. However, that spring, in the playoffs, he found another gear. Coach John Muckler put Murphy with Adam Graves and Martin Gelinas on a line dubbed the \"Kid Line\" (Murphy and Graves were 21 while Gelinas was just 19) where he enjoyed great success, putting up 14 points in 22 playoff games and providing solid secondary scoring for the Oilers en route to a Stanley Cup triumph over the Boston Bruins. \"They put our line together about the third game of the playoffs and all I recall is us just saying ‘Let’s go out there and work hard,’ Gelinas said of the 1990 Cup team. \"Murph had a lot of skill and Gravy was the big, heavy guy. All three of us combined created a pretty good energy and a big buzz. We got some timely goals, but more importantly when we were on the ice we were just making things happen\".\nMurphy built on this success the next year scoring 27 goals and 62 points then improved again the following year with career-best totals of 35 goals and 82 points. That spring Murphy led the surprising Oilers all the way to the Conference Finals where they fell to Chicago but Murphy's team leading 24 points in just 16 playoff games saw him finish fourth in post season scoring despite his team not playing in the final round. The breakthrough offensive totals came at the right time for Murphy whose contract expired following the season. Murphy and Oilers General Manager Glen Sather tried to work out a new contract through the summer with no success and ultimately broke off talks in September, before training camp with the two sides $300,000 apart. With Murphy holding out, the 1992-93 season went on with him working out with the Detroit Falcons of the Colonial Hockey League and awaiting a trade that wouldn't come until February.\nMurphy was dealt to the Chicago Blackhawks and given a new three-year contract with an option year, joining the club for the final 19 games of the season, posting 7 goals and 17 points. His first full season in Chicago, the 1993-94 campaign, saw Murphy pot 31 goals and 70 points, which would prove to be his best year with the Blackhawks. The following year Murphy led the Hawks in goals with 23, and posted 41 points in 40 games in a lockout-shortened season.\nIn 1995-96 he scored 24 goals, just one more than the previous season despite playing 30 more games, and dipped to 51 points in 70 games, well off his point-a-game pace of the previous season. Perhaps more concerning was the fact he was one of only two forwards — the other being tough guy Jim Cummins — to finish the year with a negative plus/minus rating. With wingers Tony Amonte and Eric Daze eclipsing him as the primary scoring wings, Chicago did not renew his contract when it expired that spring.\nSt. Louis Blues and San Jose Sharks.\nOn July 3, 1996, Murphy signed a 3-year, $10 million deal to join the St. Louis Blues but after scoring 20-goals and 45 points he fell short of the lofty expectations that came with his new contract. The next season, he posted just four goals and 13 points in 29 games before the Blues traded him to the San Jose Sharks for defensemen Todd Gill. Because of his large contract, the Blues also needed to send cash to San Jose in the transaction to get the deal done.\nWith the Sharks, Murphy rebounded and put up 9 points in ten games then led the team with 25 goals the following year and finished second on the team with 48 points. Despite his success, he left the team as a free agent in the off-season and was unable to find any takers.\nLate career turmoil.\nThe off-season came and went with Murphy not finding work before he eventually managed to land a try-out with the New York Rangers in November 1999. Rangers General Manager Neil Smith had been the GM of Adirondack when Murphy played for the club so the two had some history. However the tryout was very short lived as Murphy signed a contract with the Boston Bruins less than a week after beginning his try out with the Rangers. The Rangers, who weren't offered a chance to match the offer, felt spurned in the situation and Murphy made bizarre accusations about his sticks being partially sawed in half and one of his skates being \"thrown in the river\" by Smith.\nThings in Boston didn't go much better for Murphy. He lasted just 26 games with the Bruins before the team suspended him indefinitely for \"screaming profanities at coach Pat Burns.\" Murphy made few friends in the Bruins locker room and was said to have questioned his teammates' work ethic and was known to tell off both teammates and the coaching staff. \"This has been going on for a while,\" Burns said at the time of the suspension. \"The players have had enough and I have had enough.\" The Bruins, unable to find a team willing to trade for Murphy, placed the winger on waivers where he was claimed by the Washington Capitals.\nWith Washington, Murphy was given a very short leash. Team officials did their due diligence speaking with former coaches and teammates of Murphy before making the claim and General Manager George McPhee said if Murphy caused any issues with team he would be shipped out immediately. Murphy played 43 games with Washington over the next two years before ending his career on a particularly low note. Murphy, who had just one goal and six points in 14 games to start the 2000-01 season, was involved in an altercation in New York. After a team dinner and a trip to a night club, Murphy tried to talk a woman into joining him in a limo. She refused and a fight ensued which led to the woman's male companion striking Murphy in the head with a bottle.\nThe following day the Capitals assigned Murphy to their American Hockey League affiliate. Murphy refused to report and was suspended by the team and never played professional hockey again. Murphy tried — and failed — to file for workers compensation because the incident happened while he was traveling for work. The Department of Employment Services ruled that while Murphy was in New York for work reasons and the dinner was a team event, the bar Murphy traveled to after the dinner had nothing to do with his employment. Murphy appealed the decision and lost.\nPost-retirement life.\nIn 2013, Murphy became the first coach and general manager of the GMHL Alliston Coyotes in their inaugural, 2013–14 season. However, he took a leave of absence from the team midway through the playoffs due to an undisclosed allegation which resulted in a Trespass Order issued against him by the Town of New Tecumseth, Ontario.\nOn March 5, 2014, Murphy formally announced his resignation.\nIn 2017, Murphy was living in Costa Rica. He ended up living on the streets and was eventually deported back to Canada.\nOn July 6, 2018, Murphy visited the studios of Q104 / KenoraOnline and DrydenNow to talk about his struggles with post-concussion symptoms, as well as his participation in the class action lawsuit with the NHL. He acknowledged that despite earning over $15 million during his NHL career, he was essentially homeless and destitute in Kenora, Ontario. Murphy further elaborated upon his situation in \"Finding Murph\", a \"SportsCentre\" feature that aired in August 2018. The segment's creators, Josh Shiaman, Rick Westhead, Stuart Roberts, Devon Burns and Michael Banani, received a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Sports Feature Segment at the 7th Canadian Screen Awards.\nIn October 2018, the \"Detroit Free Press\" reported that Murphy was still homeless in Kenora. The report stated that his situation was caused by multiple concussions resulting in symptoms of frequent headaches, wild mood swings, and personality changes, including becoming an enforcer, starting to take drugs and alcohol. That same month, the CTV News television program \"W5\" produced a segment following two reporters from sister-network The Sports Network, as they looked in on Murphy, who admitted he had been living in shelters and tents around Ontario, where much of his earnings in the NHL had once been donated to various projects.\nIn March 2019, Murphy completed treatment through the Adult Mental Health Services (AMHS) live-in program at the Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre. In August 2019, \"USA Today\" reported Murphy was once again homeless in Kenora and \"refusing help\". In the summer of 2020, Murphy was living on the streets of Regina, Saskatchewan."

        "text": "Mike Brown (born 4 September 1985) is an English professional rugby union player who plays fullback or wing for Leicester Tigers in Premiership Rugby. Brown joined the Harlequins senior team in 2005, having played youth rugby at Salisbury and Melksham, and began playing for the England first team two years later. Between 2021–2022 Brown played a season for Newcastle Falcons.\nDuring his career, he has won 3 Six Nations Championship titles with England and two Premiership Rugby titles with Harlequins.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Southampton, he was educated at Wyvern College, until aged 15 when he moved to Peter Symonds College. Having mainly played football and little rugby, he initially wanted to play fly half. Under the coaching of Mike Marchant, he changed position to fullback. This brought him to the attention of Salisbury RFC, where he moved to age 18, before a short stint at Melksham RFC.\nBrown played with Melksham for one season, where his dad was a coach. He has cited his time at Melksham as one of his most enjoyable seasons playing rugby and as having contributed significantly to his maturing as a player. He gives significant praise to one individual mentor, Bobby Walsh, whom he credits for setting his standards on nutrition and conditioning.\nClub career.\nBrown made his debut for Harlequins during the 2005/06 season, scoring a try on debut in a pre-season friendly against London Irish on 12 August 2005. He was part of the England Under 21 team that won the 2006 Six Nations Grand Slam and also competed in the Under 21 World Championships later that year. Brown was discovered by Welsh rugby scout Craig Presdee-Salathiel, who contacted his friend Harlequins chairman David Morgan regarding Brown.\nIn the 2006–07 season, although still in a part of Harlequins' Academy side, he established himself as first choice full back. A standout season by Brown resulted in him collecting 9 tries, earning him a place on the Sky Sports Dream Team.\nBrown had a successful 2010–11 season with Quins, culminating in winning the Amlin Challenge cup, beating Munster at Thomand Park on the way to the final against Stade Francais. This form continued into the 2011/12 Aviva Premiership season, resulting in a call up to the EPS squad. He started for Harlequins in their 2011–12 Premiership final victory over Leicester Tigers.\nAt the start of the 2019/2020 season, while still an active player, one of the bars at Harlequins’ home ground (The Stoop) was renamed in Brown’s honour.\nOn 4 April 2021, it was confirmed that after 16 years with the club, Brown would officially leave Harlequins and join Newcastle Falcons on a two-year deal ahead of the 2021–22 season.\nIn January 2023 he signed a short-term contract with Leicester Tigers. He made his debut on 19 February 2023, scoring a try in a 24–18 win against Saracens.\nInternational career.\nIn the 2006–07 season, although still in a part of Harlequins' Academy side, he was capped by the England Saxons in the first two matches of the year.\nBrown got selected for the 2007 England rugby union tour of South Africa. Unaffected by a severe incidence of food poisoning within the England camp, Brown picked up his first full England cap in the record 58–10 defeat to South Africa. Brown was called into the England Saxons side that defeated Ireland A on 1 February 2008. On 1 June 2008, he started for England against the Barbarians at Twickenham in an uncapped match. On 14 June 2008, he started for England in their 37–20 defeat to New Zealand.\nBrown vied with Ben Foden for the England full-back spot in 2012, coming off the bench in the victory over Scotland at Murrayfield. He spent the 2013 Six Nations playing on the left wing with Alex Goode taking the number 15 jersey. He was finally picked at fullback by Stuart Lancaster and was subsequently named England's Man of the Series following his form during the 2013 Autumn Internationals. Brown scored his first try for England in the 2014 Six Nations Championship match against France on 1 February 2014 and his second came a week later in a comprehensive 20–0 victory against Scotland. He then scored two tries and was named Man of the Match for the third time in the tournament in the 52–11 away win over Italy in Rome. In recognition of Brown's form throughout the 2014 Six Nations Championship, he was selected by the general public for the 2014 RBS Six Nations player of the championship award.\nBrown was an integral part of the England team that won the RBS Six Nations Championship in 2016 and played every match in the 3 - 0 series win over Australia.\nBrown was named Man of the Match in the England vs Wales' Six Nations game on 10 February 2018.\nPersonal life.\nBrown married long term partner, Eliza Scarlett Woodcock, the daughter of former England international footballer Tony Woodcock, in summer 2016."

        "title": "Leyton Cricket Ground",
        "text": "Leyton Cricket Ground (formerly known as the County Ground or the Lyttelton Ground) is a cricket ground in Leyton, London. The ground was the headquarters and main home match venue of Essex County Cricket Club from 1886 until 1933, and was also used by the club for matches between 1957 and 1977. It currently hosts club and community cricket matches and has a listed pavilion.\nCricket ground.\nThe ground has been used for cricket since the early 19th century. Essex County Cricket Club played their first game there on 15 and 16 June 1885 against Surrey; the game was lost by an innings. The captain of Essex, Charles Ernest Green, became convinced that the club's headquarters ground at Brentwood was too small and isolated and he drove the campaign to acquire the Leyton ground. In 1886, the club purchased the ground from its owner, the cricket-loving Lord Lyttelton, at a \"favourable\" price of £12,000. An appeal was launched for £3,500 for the construction of a pavilion, other necessary buildings and \"general alterations\". Lord Lyttelton was the first donor, contributing £200. Initially known as the \"Lyttelton Ground\", a local newspaper report claimed that the development of the site \"gave unwonted loveliness to a district which but a short while since presented an appearance of the abomination of desolation\", since the surrounding area had been sold off for the construction of new housing and a railway line. Although £2,900 had been raised by the appeal, the purchase of the Leyton Cricket Ground left the club in financial difficulty for decades. In March 1918, a British tank nicknamed \"Julian\" was exhibited at the ground as part of a campaign to sell war bonds.\nIn 1921, the ground was sold to the Army Sports Central Board, relieving the club of a £10,000 mortgage. Leyton Cricket Ground remained the headquarters of Essex County Cricket Club until 1933, when the club relinquished its lease. In 1931 the club had looked into the possibly of buying the ground again and launched an appeal for funds to help with the purchase, but by the end of the 1932 season Essex's poor financial situation led to the plan being dropped and the decision was made to remove the county's headquarters from Leyton. In 1933 Essex gave up the lease on Leyton, moved its headquarters to Chelmsford and commenced playing matches at a variety of venues around the county. Essex returned to play matches at Leyton in 1957, by then owned by the local council, and continued to play there until 1977, when Trevor Bailey described Leyton as “our ugliest ground… but it had a certain gnarled charm”. Charles Bray, who played for and captained Essex at Leyton, took a similar view of the ground in his history of the Essex club - \"It certainly did not have beauty or charm...on a cheerless day it was a miserable place. Yet it had a character of its own and had been the stage for a great number of magnificent games.\"\nThe ground is now used for National Cricket League matches during the season, and hosts teams including Waltham Forest Cricket Club. The wooden pavilion building still stands and has been a Grade II listed building since 1999. The site is protected by Fields in Trust through a legal \"Deed of Dedication\" safeguarding the future of the space as public recreation land for future generations to enjoy. In April 2017, former Essex and England captain Graham Gooch opened new cricket facilities at the Leyton ground, including outdoor cricket nets and a non-turf pitch (NTP). In 2019, it was announced that Waltham Forest Borough Council and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) were jointly investing £900,000 to improve the site for cricket use, part of the ECB’s South Asian Action Plan which aims to engage the British Asian community in the sport, as a result of which, a covered Urban Cricket Centre was opened at the ground in June 2019 by Graham Gooch. In 2021, Waltham Forest Borough Council announced a restoration plan for the pavilion after it appeared on the Heritage at Risk Register.\nNotable matches at Leyton.\nEssex played their first county match at the Leyton ground on 15 and 16 June 1885 against Surrey. Surrey won by an innings, with Walter Read scoring 214. Essex were not a first-class county at the time and the match did not carry first-class status. The match appears to have justified Essex's adoption of the Leyton ground; in the magazine \"Cricket\", Charles W. Alcock reported that \"the Essex authorities were quite satisfied with the attendance\". Essex were granted first-class status for the 1894 season and their inaugural first-class match was played at Leyton from 14 to 16 May 1894, against Leicestershire. The visitors won by 68 runs.\nFor the 1895 season Essex were admitted to the County Championship and the inaugural Championship game at Leyton resulted in a loss to Middlesex by five wickets. In the following game Harry Pickett took all 10 wickets in Leicestershire’s innings, a performance which remains the best innings bowling figures for Essex as of 2021.\nIn 1899 the Leyton ground was the venue for Essex’s first victory over an Australia touring team. The county led by 55 runs after the first innings and Australia had to chase a target of 200 to win on the final day of the game, but were bowled out for 73. Two years later, the county marked a less auspicious occasion at Leyton when they were bowled out by Yorkshire for 30, which remained their lowest first-class score until 2013. In June 1905 Essex recorded a second victory over Australia at Leyton. In a low-scoring game, Essex won by 19 runs with Claude Buckenham taking 12 wickets in the match, which was the only loss by the 1905 Australia team to a county team. In 1906 Leyton was the venue for another Essex victory over an international team, the 1906 West Indies touring side.\nEssex's next win over an international team at Leyton in took place 1927, when they beat the New Zealand tourists, but more significantly the game featured the first broadcast commentary of a cricket match. The BBC covered the first day with short periods of commentary during the afternoon and a summary at 6.45pm. The commentator was a former Essex player, Frank Gillingham, who sat on the pavilion balcony so that crowd noise could be picked up by his microphone.\nIn June 1932 Herbert Sutcliffe and Percy Holmes of Yorkshire made a world record first-class partnership for any wicket of 555 at Leyton. There was some controversy about the record, when Sutcliffe was dismissed with the total on 555, after which the Leyton scoreboard moved the total back to 554, meaning that the partnership had only equalled the previous record. After discussion between the Essex captain, Charles Bray, and the scorers Billy Ringrose and Charlie McGahey, the total was amended back to 555. Bray asked McGahey to ensure that a run was added to bring the total to the record-breaking figure, but later admitted that he was wrong and shouldn't have allowed the change. This remained the record for any wicket till 1945–46, and it was not until the 1976–77 season in Pakistan that it was beaten for the first wicket. As of 2023 it remains the partnership record for any wicket made in England.\nOther uses.\nThe ground has also been used for football. Millwall Rovers played London Caledonians at the ground in the East London FA Cup Final in 1886. The game finished 2-2 and both teams shared the cup for six months each. In 1895 Woolwich Arsenal played a Football League Second Division game against Leicester Fosse as their own Manor Ground was closed by the Football League following crowd trouble. Leyton also occasionally played there at the ground, prior to moving to Osborne Road.\nA building at the ground is used by Leyton Amateur Boxing Club and an arts block and a sports hall are used by George Mitchell School and other community groups."

        "title": "World Championship of Golf",
        "text": "The World Championship of Golf was a championship played on the PGA Tour in the 1940s and 1950s that, in its latter years, had a purse that dwarfed every other event on the tour, including the U.S. Open. It was played in August of each year at the Tam O'Shanter Country Club, in Niles, Illinois. The same course was the venue for the All American Open played the preceding week; both tournaments were instigated by course owner George S. May. In 1953, the championship was the first golf tournament to be shown live on national television, and ended with Lew Worsham holing a wedge shot from the fairway for eagle and victory.\nHistory.\nFrom 1946 to 1948, the event was a 36-hole, winner-take-all exhibition event, with fields of four, eight, and twelve golfers, respectively. The winner took home prizes of $10,000, $5,000, and $10,000, respectively, and the losers were given generous travel expenses.\nBeginning in 1949, however, the event grew to a full-fledged 72-hole championship with a large invited field, became part of the main tour, and with its huge prize fund, became undoubtedly one of the most important tournaments for the professionals. From 1949 to 1951, its winner would go home with a check for over $10,000 – this in the days when most tour events had a first prize of $2,000 – but it was from 1952 to 1957 that the purse grew to astronomical levels. The winner took home $25,000 in 1952 and 1953, and starting in 1954, $50,000 with an additional $50,000 available in the form of a contract with May for 50 worldwide exhibition events.\nIn each of those years (1952–57), the winner of the Championship topped the tour's money list by some distance – in 1954, for example, Bob Toski led the season's money earnings with $64,000, while Jack Burke Jr. was second with just $20,000. Without the $50,000 from his one victory at Tam O'Shanter, he would have finished just tenth in earnings, despite winning three other tournaments. In 1957, Dick Mayer won both the U.S. Open – and a check for $7,200 – and this championship, and a check for $50,000. \nThe event provided one of the few showcases of its time for leading international players to compete against the best U.S. professionals, who rarely travelled outside of their country to play. Although none would win the title, players like Bobby Locke, Norman Von Nida, Roberto De Vicenzo, and Peter Thomson would all enjoy high finishes in the tournament, De Vicenzo and Thomson in particular regularly collecting big checks. \nIn 1958, May decided to pull the plug on the event in a dispute with the PGA over player entrance fees, and it disappeared from the tour. The leading money winner for 1958, Arnold Palmer, won less money during the entire season than Dick Mayer had won at Tam O'Shanter in 1957."

        "text": "Jeffrey Matthew Duncan (born December 9, 1978) is an American baseball coach and former Major League Baseball outfielder for the New York Mets. He is the head baseball coach at Kent State University. Duncan played college baseball at Iowa State University in 1998 before transferring to Arizona State University from 1999 to 2000 to play for coach Pat Murphy. After a standout college career, he would be drafted in the 7th round in 2000 by the New York Mets. He then played in the Major Leagues for the New York Mets in and . Duncan also played in the San Diego Padres, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Toronto Blue-Jays organizations. He hit and threw left-handed.\nAmateur career.\nDuncan graduated from Lemont High School where he played baseball. He was chosen by the Chicago Cubs in the 41st round of the Major League Baseball Draft, but chose to attend Iowa State University instead. A year later, he transferred to Arizona State University. In 1999, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox, and was named a league all-star.\nProfessional career.\nHe was drafted by the Mets in the 7th round of the draft, and agreed to a contract. His professional career started slowly with a batting average of .242 for the short-season A-level Pittsfield Mets in 2000 and only .217 with the A-level Capital City Bombers in . He had few RBI in the two seasons, but registered 61 stolen bases. Duncan's hitting broke through in with an average close to .400 for two A-level teams leading all Mets Minor Leaguers.\nIn 2003, Duncan hit well at Double-A Binghamton. Duncan was called up to the majors and made his debut on May 20, 2003. After three games and one start, Duncan was back in Binghamton until mid-July. When he returned to the majors, he collected 12 hits in 11 games and his average stood at .400. This turned out to be the lone good hitting streak of his career. In August 2003, he hit .106 with no RBI and spent a short time with the Triple-A Norfolk Tides. His .200 average in September was punctuated by the only three-hit game of his career.\nDuncan was back in the majors with the Mets in 2004, but after only one hit in 15 at bats through May 5, Duncan was back in the minors. He hit under .260 at both the Double-A and Triple-A levels of the Mets' system and was not brought back to the majors. In , he hit only .245 with the Double-A Binghamton Mets and was released on August 11. Duncan was soon signed as a free agent by the San Diego Padres. Although he hit .300 for Double-A Mobile, San Diego did not re-sign him after the season. In , Duncan hit .299 with the Los Angeles Dodgers' Triple-A Las Vegas 51s. He signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays on November 10, 2006, but after a strong and impressive spring training he was sent down to AAA Syracuse. After an injury plagued season, he was released on July 3, .\nAfter his release, he signed with the Somerset Patriots of the Atlantic League, but asked for his release on May 21, ; he immediately retired.\nCoaching career.\nIn September 2009, Duncan left his volunteer position with the Auburn Tigers for a full-time assistant coaching position with the Purdue Boilermakers, which he held through the end of the 2013 season.

        "title": "History of tennis",
        "text": "The racket sport traditionally named lawn tennis, invented in Edgbaston, Birmingham, England, now commonly known simply as tennis, is the direct descendant of what is now denoted real tennis or royal tennis, which continues to be played today as a separate sport with more complex rules. The first Lawn Tennis Club and tournament was held in Royal Leamington Spa on 1 August 1882. \nMost rules of (lawn) tennis derive from this precursor and it is reasonable to see both sports as variations of the same game. Most historians believe that tennis originated in the monastic cloisters in northern France in the 12th century, but the ball was then struck with the palm of the hand, hence the name jeu de paume (\"game of the palm\"). It was not until the 16th century that rackets came into use and the game began to be called 'tennis'. It was popular in England and France, and Henry VIII of England was an enthusiast of the game, now referred to as real tennis.\nMany original tennis courts remain, including courts at Oxford, Cambridge, Falkland Palace in Fife where Mary Queen of Scots regularly played, and Hampton Court Palace. Many of the French courts were decommissioned with the terror that accompanied the French Revolution. The Tennis Court Oath (\"Serment du Jeu de Paume\") was a pivotal event during the first days of the French Revolution; it was a pledge signed by 576 of the 577 members from the Third Estate who were locked out of a meeting of the Estates-General on 20 June 1789.\nMarylebone Cricket Club's Rules of Lawn Tennis have been official, with periodic slight modifications, ever since 1875. Those rules were adopted by the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club for the first lawn tennis championship, The Championships, Wimbledon in 1877.\nThe Davis Cup, an annual competition between men's national teams, dates to 1900. The analogous competition for women's national teams, the Fed Cup, was founded as the Federation Cup in 1963 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the International Tennis Federation, also known as the ITF.\nPromoter C. C. Pyle created the first professional tennis tour in 1926, with a group of American and French tennis players playing exhibition matches to paying audiences. The most notable of these early professionals were the American Vinnie Richards and the Frenchwoman Suzanne Lenglen. Players turning pro could not compete in the major (amateur) tournaments.\nIn 1968 commercial pressures and rumours of some amateurs taking money under the table led to the abandonment of this distinction, inaugurating the Open Era, in which all players could compete in all tournaments and top players were able to make their living from tennis. With the beginning of the Open Era, the establishment of an international professional tennis circuit, and revenues from the sale of television rights, tennis's popularity has spread worldwide, and the sport has shed its upper/middle-class English-speaking image (although it is acknowledged that this stereotype still exists).\nEtymology.\nThe word tennis came into use in English in the mid-14th century from French, via the Anglo-Norman term Tenez, which can be translated as 'hold!', 'receive!' or 'take!', a call from the server to his opponent indicating that he is about to serve. The first known appearance of the word in English literature is by poet John Gower in his poem titled 'In Praise of Peace' dedicated to King Henry IV and composed in 1400; \"Of the tenetz to winne or lese a chase, Mai no lif wite er that the bal be ronne\". (Whether a chase is won or lost at tennis, Nobody can know until the ball is run).\nOrigin.\nTennis is mentioned in literature as far back as the Middle Ages. In \"The Second Shepherds' Play\" (c. 1500) shepherds gave three gifts, including a tennis ball, to the newborn Christ. Sir Gawain, a knight of King Arthur's round table, plays tennis against a group of 17 giants in \"The Turke and Gowin\" (c. 1500).\nReal tennis.\nThe Medieval form of tennis is termed as real tennis, a game that evolved over three centuries from an earlier ball game played around the 12th century in France that involved hitting a ball with a bare hand and later with a glove. By the 16th century the glove had become a racquet, the game had moved to an enclosed playing area and the rules had stabilized. Real tennis spread in popularity throughout royalty in Europe, reaching its peak in the 16th century.\nIn 1437 at the Blackfriars, Perth, the playing of tennis indirectly led to the death of King James I of Scotland, when the drain outlet, through which he hoped to escape assassins, had been blocked to prevent the loss of tennis balls. James was trapped and killed.\nFrancis I of France (1515–1547) was an enthusiastic player and promoter of real tennis, building courts and encouraging play among the courtiers and commoners. His successor, Henry II (1547–59), was also an excellent player and continued the royal French tradition. In 1555 an Italian priest, Antonio Scaino da Salothe, wrote the first known book about tennis, \"Trattato del Giuoco della Palla\". Two French kings died from tennis related episodes—Louis X of a severe chill after playing and Charles VIII after hitting his head during a game. King Charles IX granted a constitution to the Corporation of Tennis Professionals in 1571, creating the first pro tennis 'tour', establishing three professional levels: apprentice, associate, and master. A professional named Forbet wrote and published the first codification of the rules in 1599.\nRoyal interest in England began with Henry V (1413–22). Henry VIII (1509–47) made the biggest impact as a young monarch, playing the game with gusto at Hampton Court on a court he had built in 1530. It is believed that his second wife, Anne Boleyn, was watching a game when she was arrested and that Henry was playing when news of her execution arrived. During the reign of James I (1603–25) London had 14 courts.\nReal tennis is mentioned in literature by William Shakespeare, who mentions \"tennis balles\" in \"Henry V\" (1599), when a basket of them is given to King Henry as a mockery of his youth and playfulness; the incident is also mentioned in some earlier chronicles and ballads. One of the most striking early references appears in a painting by Giambattista Tiepolo entitled \"The Death of Hyacinth\" (1752–1753), in which a strung racquet and three tennis balls are depicted. The theme of the painting is the mythological story of Apollo and Hyacinth, written by Ovid. Giovanni Andrea dell'Anguillara translated it into Italian in 1561 and replaced the ancient game of discus in the original text with pallacorda or tennis, which had achieved a high status at the courts in the middle of the 16th century. Tiepolo's painting, displayed at the Museo Thyssen Bornemisza in Madrid, was ordered in 1752 by German count Wilhelm Friedrich Schaumburg Lippe, who was an avid tennis player.\nThe game thrived among the 17th-century nobility in France, Spain, Italy and the Austro-Hungarian Empire but suffered under English Puritanism. By the Age of Napoleon the royal families of Europe were besieged and real tennis was largely abandoned. Real tennis played a minor role in the history of the French Revolution, through the Tennis Court Oath, a pledge signed by French deputies on a real tennis court, which formed a decisive early step in starting the revolution.\nAn epitaph in St Michael's Church, Coventry, written circa 1705 read, in part:\nIn England, during the 18th and early 19th centuries as real tennis declined, three other racquet sports emerged: racquets, squash racquets and lawn tennis (the modern game).\nBirth of lawn tennis.\nThe lawyer and memoirist William Hickey recalled that in 1767 \"in the summer we had another club, which met at the Red House in Battersea fields, nearly opposite Ranelagh... The game we played was an invention of our own, and called field tennis, which afforded noble exercise... The field, which was of sixteen acres in extent, was kept in as high an order, and smooth as a bowling green.\"\nThe modern sport is tied to two separate inventions.\nBetween 1859 and 1865, in Birmingham, England, Major Harry Gem, a solicitor, and his friend Augurio Perera, a Spanish merchant, combined elements of the game of racquets and a ball of wind and played it on a croquet lawn in Edgbaston. In 1872, both men moved to Leamington Spa and in 1874, with two doctors from the Warneford Hospital, founded the world's first tennis club, the Leamington Tennis Club.\nIn December 1873 Major Walter Clopton Wingfield designed an hourglass-shaped tennis court in order to obtain a patent on his court (as the rectangular court was already in use and was unpatentable). A temporary patent on this hourglass-shaped court was granted to him in February, 1874, which he never renewed when it expired in 1877. It is commonly believed, mistakenly, that Wingfield obtained a patent on the game he devised to be played on that type of court, but in fact Wingfield never applied for nor received a patent on his game, although he did obtain a copyright — but not a patent — on his rules for playing it. And, after a running series of articles and letters in the British sporting magazine \"The Field\", and a meeting at London's Marylebone Cricket Club, the official rules of lawn tennis were promulgated by that Club in 1875, which preserved none of the aspects of the variations that Wingfield had dreamed up and named \"Sphaeristikè\" (, that is, \"sphere-istic\", an ancient Greek adjective meaning \"of or pertaining to use of a ball, globe or sphere\"), which was soon corrupted to \"sticky\". Wingfield claimed that he had invented his version of the game for the amusement of his guests at a weekend garden party on his estate of Nantclwyd, in Llanelidan, Wales in 1874, but research has demonstrated that even his game was not likely played during that country weekend in Wales. He had likely based his game on both the evolving sport of outdoor tennis and on real tennis. Much of modern tennis terminology also derives from this period, for Wingfield and others borrowed both the name and much of the French vocabulary of real tennis, and applied them to their variations of real tennis. In the scholarly work \"Tennis: A Cultural History\", Heiner Gillmeister reveals that on 8 December 1874, Wingfield had written to Harry Gem, commenting that he had been experimenting with his version of lawn tennis for a year and a half. Gem himself had largely credited Perera with the invention of the game.\nWingfield did patent his hourglass court in 1874, but not his eight-page rule book titled \"Sphairistike or Lawn Tennis\", but he failed in enforcing his patent. In his version, the game was played on an hourglass-shaped court, and the net was higher (4 feet 8 inches) than it is in official lawn tennis. The service had to be made from a diamond-shaped box in the middle of one side of the court only, and the service had to bounce beyond the service line instead of in front of it. He adopted the rackets-based system of scoring where games consisted of 15 points (called 'aces'). None of these quirks survived the Marylebone Cricket Club's 1875 \"Rules of Lawn Tennis\" that have been official, with periodic slight modifications, ever since then. Those rules were adopted by the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club for the first Lawn Tennis Championship, at Wimbledon in 1877 (the men who devised those rules were members of both clubs). Wingfield does deserve great credit for popularizing the game of lawn tennis, as he marketed, in one boxed set, all the equipment needed to play his or other versions of it, equipment that had been available previously only at several different outlets. Because of this convenience, versions of the game spread like wildfire in Britain, and by 1875 lawn tennis had virtually supplanted croquet and badminton as outdoor games for both men and women.\nMary Ewing Outerbridge played the game in Bermuda at Clermont, a house with a spacious lawn in Paget parish. Innumerable histories claim that in 1874, Mary returned from Bermuda onboard the ship S.S. \"Canima\" and introduced lawn tennis to the United States, setting up supposedly the first tennis court in the United States on the grounds of the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club, which was near where the Staten Island Ferry Terminal is today. The club was founded on or about 22 March 1872. She is also mistakenly said to have played the first tennis game in the U.S. against her sister Laura in Staten Island, New York on an hourglass-shaped court. However, all this would have been impossible, as the tennis equipment she is said to have brought back from Bermuda was not available in Bermuda until 1875, and her next trip to Bermuda, when it was available there, was in 1877. In fact, lawn tennis was first introduced in the United States on a grass court on Col. William Appleton's Estate in Nahant, Massachusetts by Dr. James Dwight (\"the Father of American Lawn Tennis\"), Henry Slocum, Richard Dudley Sears and Sears' half-brother Fred Sears, in 1874.\nTerminology.\nWingfield borrowed both the name and much of the French vocabulary of real tennis:\nTournaments and tours of the Amateur Era.\nAmateur tournaments.\nThe Four Majors.\nThe four majors or Grand Slam tournaments, the four biggest competitions on the tennis circuit, are Wimbledon, the US Open, the French Open, and the Australian Open. Since the mid-1920s they became and have remained the more prestigious events in tennis. Winning these four tournaments in the same year is called the Calendar Grand Slam (a term borrowed from bridge).\n1877: Wimbledon.\nThe Championships, Wimbledon, were founded by the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in 1877 to raise money for the club. The first Championships were contested by 22 men and the winner received a Silver Gilt Cup proclaiming the winner to be \"The All England Lawn Tennis Club Single Handed Champion of the World\". The first Championships culminated a significant debate on how to standardize the rules. The following year, it was recognized as the official British Championships, although it was open to international competitors. In 1884 the Ladies Singles and Gentlemen's Doubles Championships were inaugurated, followed by the Ladies and Mixed Doubles in 1913.\nName\n1877: The Championships\nSurface\n1877: Grass\nVenue change\n1877: Worple Road, Wimbledon\n1922: Church Road, Wimbledon\n1881: U.S. Open.\nTennis was first played in the U.S. on a grass court set up on the Estate of Col. William Appleton in Nahant, Massachusetts by James Dwight, Richard Dudley Sears and Fred Sears in 1874. In 1881, the desire to play tennis competitively led to the establishment of tennis clubs.\nThe first American National tournament was played in 1880 at the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club in New York. An Englishman named Otway Woodhouse won the singles match. There was also a doubles match which was won by a local pair. There were different rules at each club. The ball in Boston was larger than the one normally used in NY. On 21 May 1881, the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (now the United States Tennis Association) was formed to standardize the rules and organize competitions.\nThe U.S. National Men's Singles Championship, now the US Open, was first held in 1881 at Newport, Rhode Island. The U.S. National Women's Singles Championships were first held in 1887 in Philadelphia.\nThe tournament was made officially one of the tennis 'Majors' from 1924 by the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF).\nName change\n1881: U.S. National Championship\n1968: U.S. Open\nSurface change\n1881: Grass\n1975: Clay Har-Tru\n1978: Hard DecoTurf\nVenue change (men's championship)\n1881: Newport\n1915: Forest Hills\n1921: Germantown\n1924: Forest Hills\n1978: Flushing Meadows\n1891/1925: French Open.\nTennis was predominantly a sport of the English-speaking world, dominated by Great Britain and the United States. It was also popular in France, where the French Open dates to 1891 as the Championat de France International de Tennis. This tournament was not recognised as a Major or Grand Slam tournament until it was opened to all nationalities in 1925.\nName change\n1891: Championnat de France\n1925: Championnats Internationaux de France\n1928: Tournoi de Roland Garros\nSurface change\n1891: Clay and Sand\n1909: Clay\nVenue change\n1891–1908: shared by Tennis Club de Paris/Ile de Puteaux, Paris/Racing Club de France\n1909: Societe Athletique de la Villa Primrose, Bordeaux\n1910: Racing Club de France, Paris\n1925: Stade Français, Paris\n1926: Racing Club de France, Paris\n1927: Stade Français, Paris\n1928: Stade Roland Garros, Paris\n1905: Australian Open.\nThe Australian Open was first played in 1905 as The Australasian (Australia and New Zealand) Championships. Because of its geographic remoteness, historically, the event did not gain attendance from the top tennis players. It became one of the major tennis tournaments starting in 1924 (designated by the ILTF). In 1927, because of New Zealand tennis authorities releasing their commitments to the tournament, it became known as the Australian Championships. For most of the 1970s and the early 1980s, the event lacked participation from top ranked tennis professionals. Since its move to Melbourne Park in 1988, the Australian Open has gained the popularity of the other three majors.\nName change\n1905: Australasian Championships\n1927: Australian Championships\n1969: Australian Open\nSurface change\n1905: Grass\n1988: Hard Rebound Ace\n2008: Hard Plexicushion\n2020: Hard GreenSet\nVenue change\n1905: Melbourne\n1906: Christchurch and alternated in Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth.

Davis of the Harvard University tennis team designed a tournament format with the idea of challenging the British to a tennis showdown. The first match, between the United States and Great Britain was held in Boston, Massachusetts in 1900. The American team, of which Dwight Davis was a part, surprised the British by winning the first three matches. By 1905 the tournament had expanded to include Belgium, Austria, France, and Australasia, a combined team from Australia and New Zealand that competed jointly until 1913.\nThe tournament initially was known as the International Lawn Tennis Challenge. It was renamed the Davis Cup following the death of Dwight Davis in 1945. The tournament has vastly expanded and, on its 100th anniversary in 1999, 130 nations competed.\nInternational Tennis Federation.\n1913 also saw 12 national tennis associations agree at a Paris conference to form the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF), renamed in 1977 as the current International Tennis Federation (ITF). The rules the association promulgated in 1924 have remained remarkably stable in the ensuing century, the one major change being the addition of the tie-break system designed by James Van Alen.\nThe same year, tennis withdrew from the Olympics after the 1924 Games but returned 60 years later as a 21-and-under demonstration event in 1984. This reinstatement was credited by the efforts by the then ITF President Philippe Chatrier, ITF General Secretary David Gray and ITF Vice President Pablo Llorens as well as support from IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch. The success of the event was overwhelming, and the IOC decided to reintroduce tennis as a full medal sport at Seoul in 1988.\nThe Fed Cup.\nThe idea of a Davis Cup-style tournament for national women's teams is surprisingly old—it was first proposed in 1919 by Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman. After she was turned down, she donated a trophy in 1923 that would be known as the Wightman Cup, awarded in an annual match between the two strongest women's tennis nations of the time, the United States and Great Britain.\nWightman's original idea for a worldwide women's team tournament would bear fruit more than 40 years later in 1962, when Nell Hopman persuaded the ITF to begin sponsoring such an event. The first Federation Cup was played in 1963 as part of the ITF's 50th anniversary celebrations; it involved 16 countries and was played over one week. By the 1990s, over 70 nations competed each year, and regional qualifiers were introduced in 1992. In 1995, the ITF introduced a new Davis Cup-style format for the competition and rechristened it the Fed Cup.\nThe professional circuit.\nIn 1926, promoter C.C. Pyle established the first professional tour with a group of American and French players playing exhibition matches to paying audiences. The most notable early professionals were American Vinnie Richards and Frenchwoman Suzanne Lenglen. Players turning pro could not compete in the major (amateur) tournaments.\nBefore the Open Era, the leading professional players were under contract with a professional promoter who controlled their appearances. For example, in 1926, Lenglen and Richards toured North America along with Paul Féret and Mary K. Browne under contract to Charles C. Pyle. The main events of the professional circuit comprised head-to-head competition and by-invitation Pro Championships, which were the equivalent of the Grand Slam tournaments on the professional circuit.\nSuzanne Lenglen was the leading player in the first year of the professional circuit, and after she retired in February 1927, few female players played on the professional circuit before the Open Era.\nPro tours.\nIn the years before the Open Era, professionals often played more frequently on head-to-head tours than in tournaments because tours paid much better than tournaments and the number of professional tournaments was small. For example, Fred Perry earned U.S. $91,000 ($ today) in a 1937 North American tour against Ellsworth Vines but won only U.S. $450 ($) for his 1938 victory at the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships. Vines probably never entered a tournament in 1937 and 1938. In 1937, Vines played 70 matches on two tours and no tournament matches. Even in the 1950s, some professionals continued to play tour matches. During his first five months as a professional (January through May 1957), Ken Rosewall played 76 matches on a tour against Pancho Gonzales but only 9 tournament matches. Joe McCauley determined that for 1952, only 7 professional tournaments were played by the top international players, and 2 other professional tournaments (the British Pro and the German Pro) were reserved for domestic players. Only during the 1960s did professional tournaments become more significant than tours.\nPro Championships (Pro Slams).\nIn addition to head-to-head events several annual professional tournaments were called championship tournaments. The most prestigious was usually the Wembley Championship, held at the Wembley Arena in England, played between 1934 and 1990. The oldest was the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships, played between 1927 and 1999. Between 1954 and 1962, it was played indoors in Cleveland and was called the World Professional Championships. The third major tournament was the French Pro Championship, played between 1930 and 1968. The British and American championships continued into the Open Era but devolved to the status of minor tournaments after the late 1960s.\nThe Tournament of Champions was held between 1957 and 1959, the 1957 Australian editions taking place in Sydney White City and Melbourne Kooyong, while the U.S. editions in 1957, 1958 and 1959 took place at Forest Hills, Queens. There was also the Wimbledon Pro tournament held in August 1967, the first tournament where professional tennis players were allowed to play at Wimbledon.\nOpen Era.\nThe Open Era began in 1968 when Grand Slam tournaments agreed to allow professional players to compete with amateurs. \nBefore 1968, only amateurs were allowed to compete in Grand Slam tournaments and other events organized or sanctioned by the ILTF, including the Davis Cup. \nThe move is made because the English are tired of the hypocrisy in the sport, the shamateurism that plagues high-class tennis. It is well known that amateurs bargain for – and receive – exorbitant expenses to compete at many tournaments.\n\"We must take action on our own account to make the game honest\", said Derek Penmam of the British association. \"For too long now we have been governed by a set of amateur rules that are quite unenforceable.\"\nDuring the first years of the Open Era, power struggles between the ILTF and the commercial promoters led to boycotts of Grand Slam events. The first Open Era event was the 1968 British Hard Court Championships held in April at The West Hants Club in Bournemouth, England, while the first open Grand Slam tournament was the 1968 French Open in May. Both tournaments were won by Ken Rosewall.\nThe Open Era allowed all tennis players the opportunity to make a living by playing tennis.\nNational Tennis League (NTL) and World Championship Tennis (WCT).\nIn 1968, a few professionals were independent, including Lew Hoad, Mal Anderson, Luis Ayala, and Owen Davidson, but most of the best players were under contract. George McCall operated the National Tennis League (NTL) and managed Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, Andrés Gimeno, Pancho Gonzales, Fred Stolle and Roy Emerson. Meanwhile Dave Dixon (later succeeded by Lamar Hunt) ran the World Championship Tennis (WCT) and managed the \"Handsome Eight\": John Newcombe, Tony Roche, Nikola Pilić, Roger Taylor, Pierre Barthès, Earl \"Butch\" Buchholz, Cliff Drysdale and Dennis Ralston. In 1968, none of the original Handsome Eight WCT players participated in the French Open. In 1970, NTL players did not play in the Australian Open because their organization did not receive a guarantee. In 1970, neither WCT nor NTL players played in the French Open.\nGrand Prix circuit.\nIn the first two years of the Open Era, the National Tennis League and WCT promoters began to take control of the game. To outmaneuver them, Jack Kramer, the best player of the late 1940s / early 1950s, and at that time a promoter, conceived the Grand Prix tennis circuit in late 1969. He described it as: . . . a series of tournaments with a money bonus pool that would be split up on the basis of a cumulative point system. This would encourage the best players to compete regularly in the series, so that they could share in the bonus at the end and qualify for a special championship tournament that would climax the year.\nIn 1970, none of the contract players participated in the French Open. The International Lawn Tennis Federation, alarmed by the control of the promoters, approved Kramer's Grand Prix. Twenty-seven tournaments, including the three Grand Slams (French Open, Wimbledon and US Open), were played that year, with Stockholm tournament ending on 1 November. The independent professional players along with a few contract players, entered the Grand Prix circuit. Contract players could play Grand Prix events provided their contracts allowed it, and that they had adequate time apart from their own circuit.\nTour rivalries and the creation of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP).\nThe first WCT tournaments were held in February 1968 and the first NTL tournaments in March 1969. In July 1970, the WCT absorbed the NTL. At the end of 1970, a panel of journalists ranked the players, leading the WCT to send invitations to the 32 top men to play the 1971 WCT circuit: among the 32, Ilie Năstase, Stan Smith, Jan Kodeš, Željko Franulović and Clark Graebner stayed independent. In 1971, the WCT ran 20 tournaments, and concluded the year with the WCT Finals. In 1971, the majority of the best players still mainly played the WCT circuit. Thus, the 1971 Australian Open was a WCT competition whereas the French Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open were ILTF Grand Prix events.\nBy then, the rivalry between the two groups became so intense that Rosewall, Gimeno, Laver, Emerson and some other WCT players boycotted the 1971 US Open (although Newcombe played and lost in the first round to Kodes). Bill Riordan (the future manager of Jimmy Connors) complicated matters further with a third professional tour, the U.S. Indoor Circuit. In 1972, the conflict between the ILTF and the WCT culminated in the ILTF banning the contract professional players from all ILTF Grand Prix events between January and July, which included the 1972 French Open and 1972 Wimbledon.\nAt the 1972 US Open in September, all the players attended and agreed to form a player syndicate to protect themselves from the promoters and associations, resulting in the creation of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP).\nIn 1973, there were four rival professional circuits: the WCT circuit, the Grand Prix circuit, the U.S. Indoor Circuit with Connors and Ilie Năstase and the European Spring Circuit with Năstase as their star. During the year, the ILTF banned Nikola Pilić from 1973 Wimbledon, due to Pilic's alleged refusal to play in Yugoslavia's Davis Cup tie against New Zealand. In retaliation, 81 out of 84 of Pilic's fellow players who were ATP members, boycotted 1973 Wimbledon in response, stating that professional players should have the right of deciding whether to play Davis Cup matches or not. The only ATP players who refused to boycott 1973 Wimbledon were Ilie Năstase, Roger Taylor and Ray Keldie. They were later fined by the ATP for their participation in the tournament.\nBetween 1974 and 1978, any tennis player who participated in the nascent World Team Tennis, which conflicted with the European leg of the Grand Prix circuit, was banned by the French Tennis Federation from playing in the French Open in the same calendar year. \nIntegration.\nIn 1978 the ILTF Grand Prix and WCT circuits merged. However, In 1982, the WCT circuit separated again and created a more complex WCT ranking, similar to the ATP ranking. The WCT was not as successful in the 1980s, and the Grand Prix circuit became the primary circuit. The Grand Prix's governance was led by the Men's International Professional Tennis Council (also called the Men's Tennis Council). The WCT Finals in Dallas continued being held until the end of the 1980s, and then disbanded with the creation of the ATP Tour for 1990.\nThe Open Era, the global professional circuit, and television helped tennis spread globally and shed its elitist, anglocentric image. In the United States, since the 1970s, courts have been a common feature of public recreational facilities. Accordingly, in the 1970s, the U.S. Open moved from the private West Side Tennis Club to a public park (the USTA National Tennis Center, Flushing Meadows Park) that is accessible to anyone who buys a ticket. About the same time, the ruling body's name changed from the United States Lawn Tennis Association to the United States Tennis Association.\nATP Tour.\nIn 1990, the Association of Tennis Professionals, led by Hamilton Jordan, replaced the MTC as the governing body of men's professional tennis. They established the ATP Tour, and packaged the nine most prestigious events as the \"Championship Series – Single Tournament Week\", and beginning in 1996, as the \"Super Nine\". Twelve of the Grand Prix which were slightly less prestigious than the first nine events were renamed as the \"Championship Series – Double Week\" (meaning in most cases, 2 of those tournaments occurred the same week). Winning a Super Nine tournament was worth roughly half the points (370) of winning a Grand Slam tournament (750), while Championship Series tournaments were worth as much as 360 points depending on the total prize money. The format continued until 2000, at which time the Super Nine were renamed the Masters Series (the winner being awarded 500 points), occupying the rank below the Grand Slams (1000 points for the winner), and the Championship Series was renamed to simply the International Series Gold (worth 250 to 300 points for the winner). In 2000, the Grand Slam tournaments and the Masters Series tournaments became mandatory professional events if a player's ranking qualifies them for the tournament. Players were automatically entered and Masters and Slam events became the baseline for player rankings with up to an additional 5 tournaments also counted (18 in all plus the ATP Finals if they qualify). Before 2000, a players' best 14 tournaments were counted towards the ATP Point Rankings.\nIn 2009, the Masters events were renamed the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 with the Monte-Carlo Masters becoming a non-mandatory event, meaning a player could use his results from a lower-level tournament in place of it. International Series Gold became the ATP World Tour 500 and the remaining events became the ATP World Tour 250. The numbers in the tournament type name indicate the winners' ranking points. By way of comparison, a winner of one of the four Grand Slam tournaments is awarded 2000 points. In 2009, a greater emphasis began to be placed on winning a tournament, as the points awarded to the runner-up dropped from 70% of the champion's points to 60% (i.e. from 700 points to 600 points in a Masters 1000 event). Points also began to be awarded for Davis Cup singles play.\nWomen's professional tennis.\nWomen's professional tennis began in 1926, when world number one female player Suzanne Lenglen accepted $50,000 for a series of matches against three-time U.S. Champion Mary K. Browne. The series ended in 1927, and the women did not compete as professionals again until 1941 when Alice Marble headlined a tour against Mary Hardwick. World War II hindered most professional competitions and many players were involved with entertaining the troops.\nIn 1947, women professionals were again in action with a short-lived series of exhibition matches between Pauline Betz and Sarah Palfrey Cooke, both U.S. National Champions. In 1950 and 1951, Bobby Riggs signed Betz and Gussie Moran to play a pro tour with Jack Kramer and Pancho Segura, wherein Betz dominated Moran. Althea Gibson turned professional in 1958 and joined with Karol Fageros (\"the Golden Goddess\") as the opening act for the Harlem Globetrotters for one season.\nThere was virtually no further women's professional tennis until 1967, when promoter George McCall signed Billie Jean King, Ann Jones, Françoise Dürr, and Rosie Casals to join his tour of eight men for two years. The professional women then played as independents as the Open Era began.\nIn 1970, promoter for the Pacific Southwest Championships in Los Angeles Jack Kramer offered the women only $7,500 in prize money versus the men's total of $50,000. When Kramer refused to match the men's prize money, King and Casals urged the other women to boycott.\nGladys Heldman, American publisher of \"World Tennis\" magazine, responded with a separate women's tour under the sponsorship of Virginia Slims cigarettes. In 1971 and 1972, the WT Women's Pro Tour offered nearly 10 times the prize money of other pro women's tennis events. The USLTA initially would not sanction the tour; however, the two groups determined to give Virginia Slims the individual events, and the USLTA the tour, thus resolving the conflict. In 1973, the U.S. Open made history by offering equal prize money to men and women. Billie Jean King, the most visible advocate for the women's cause, earned over $100,000 in 1971 and 1972.\nIn the famous Battle of the Sexes exhibition match against the vocally sexist Bobby Riggs in September 1973, King brought even more media attention to tennis, and to women professionals in all walks of life by beating Riggs.\nThe Women's Tennis Association, formed in 1973, is the principal organizing body of women's professional tennis, organizing the worldwide, professional WTA Tour. From 1984 to 1998, the finals matches of the championship event were best-of-five, uniquely among women's tournaments. In 1999, the finals reverted to best-of-three. The WTA Tour Championships are generally considered to be the women's fifth most prestigious event (after the four Grand Slam tournaments.) Sponsors have included Virginia Slims (1971–78), Avon (1979–82), Virginia Slims again (1983–94), J.P. Morgan Chase (1996–2000), Sanex (2001) Home Depot (2002), Sony Ericsson (2006–2010), and Hologic (2022–present)\nInternational Tennis Hall of Fame.\nIn 1954, James Van Alen founded the International Tennis Hall of Fame, a non-profit museum in Newport, Rhode Island. The building contains a large collection of memorabilia as well as honoring prominent players and others. Each year, a grass-court tournament takes place on its grounds, as well as an induction ceremony honoring new members."

        "text": "The 2010 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament started Saturday, March 20, 2010, and was completed on Tuesday, April 6 of the same year with University of Connecticut Huskies defending their title from the previous year by defeating Stanford, 53–47.\nTournament procedure.\nPending any changes to the format, a total of 64 teams will enter the 2010 tournament. 32 automatic bids shall be awarded to each program that wins their conference's tournament. The remaining 36 bids are \"at-large\", with selections extended by the NCAA Selection Committee. The tournament is split into four regional tournaments, and each regional has teams seeded from 1 to 16, with the committee ostensibly making every region as comparable to the others as possible. The top-seeded team in each region plays the #16 team, the #2 team plays the #15, etc. (meaning where the two seeds add up to 17, that team will be assigned to play another).\nThe basis for the subregionals returned to the approach used between 1982 and 2002; the top sixteen teams, as chosen in the bracket selection process, hosted the first two rounds on campus.\nThe Selection Committee will also seed the entire field from 1 to 64.\nNotable events.\nThe top seeded Tennessee Lady Vols faced the Baylor Lady Bears in the Memphis Regional semifinals. This was a rematch of the season open for the two teams, a game won by Tennessee 74–65. Earlier in March, the freshman center for Baylor, Brittney Griner had broken the nose of Jordan Barncastle in a game against Texas Tech, which resulted in Griner playing more tentative, concerned about drawing attention to the referees. She was not tentative in the game against the Lady Vols, scoring 27 points and recording ten blocks. Despite her performance, Tennessee led by five points with under eight minutes to go in the game. Baylor then went on a 21–1 run to take a 15-point lead, and command of the game. Baylor won 77–62 to advance to the regional finals.\nStanford more than doubled up Georgia, winning 73–36 in the regional semifinal, then faced Xavier. Although Stanford opened up an early five-point lead, Xavier cut the lead to one. The Cardinal extended the lead to five again, and the Musketeers cut the lead to two points at the half. Stanford opened up a six-point lead in the second half, but Xavier responded to take a lead. With just under a minute to go, Xavier took a two-point lead and Kayla Pedersen hit a jumper to tie the game at 53 points apiece. With 18 seconds left, Xavier ran a play that opened up Delaquese Jernigan under the basket. She received the ball, and missed a point-blank uncontested layup. The rebound came out beyond the three-point line to Amber Harris. The Cardinal were trying to cover the Xavier players, but missed Jernigan standing by herself under the basket. Harris passed the ball in to Jernigan who took an uncontested layup and missed it again. With only four seconds left in the game Jeanette Pohlen drove the length of the court, weaving among defenders, and threw up a shot with under a second left. The shot went in and the Cardinal won 55–53 to advance.\nIn the Kansas City Regional, both top seeds were upset in the semifinal round. Kentucky, led by 21 point from A'dia Mathies, opened up a lead ant he second half, extended it to 19 points, and were victorious, beating Nebraska 76–67 to advance to the regional finals. The regional semifinal game was a second of the season for Oklahoma and Notre Dame, a game the Irish has won in the regular season. In this game the score was tied early, while Oklahoma took a slim lead at the half. They extended the lead to eight points in the second half, but Notre Dame took the lead back at 50–49. With less than a minute to play, Oklahoma took a three-point lead, but Skyler Diggins hit a three-pointer to tie the game at 66 points each. Oklahoma had the ball for the last possession, but never got a shot off, so the game went to overtime. The game was tied with 72 points for each team with seconds to go when Oklahoma had another chance. This time, Nyeshia Stevenson hit a three-pointer, giving the Sooners a three-point lead with just over four seconds to go. Notre Dame tried a long inbounds pass, but were unsuccessful, and Oklahoma won 77–72.\nIn the Dayton Regional, Connecticut prevailed easily. They held their first three opponents to under 40 points each. While Florida State, in the regional final, managed to 50, the Huskies scored 90. This set up a game against Baylor in a semifinal game. The Baylor Bears would not go so easily. The Huskies seemed to be on the same track as prior games, with a 13-point lead at halftime. Kalana Greene scored the first basket of the second half, extending the lead to 15 points. However, Baylor then scored the next twelve points, cutting the lead to three. Connecticut, which had missed eight consecutive shots, began hitting again, and their defense held Baylor without a field goal for over seven minutes. UConn scored 16 points during the stretch and rebuild the lead. UConn would go on to win the game 70–50, to reach the championship game.\nAfter the close call against Xavier, the Cardinal seemed in control in their game against Oklahoma in the second half when they led by 18 points. However, the Sooners, concentrated on defense, and cut the lead to three points with only 16 seconds left in the game. On the inbounds play, Oklahoma failed to guard Nnemkadi Ogwumike, and Kayla Pedersen made a long pass to an open Ogwumike who made an open layup to extend the lead to five points. Then Stanford stole the ball, was fouled, and hit the final two free throws to complete the victory 73–66. Ogwumike scored 38 points, including the final seven of the game for Stanford.\nStanford entered the national championship game on a 27-game winning streak. The last game they had lost, occurred in December 2009. It was against Connecticut. The UConn team entered the national championship game on a 77 winning streak. The last game they had lost, occurred in April 2008. It was against Stanford.\nUConn was no stranger to low scoring halves in an NCAA game. There had been, up to this point, eleven halves of basketball in NCAA tournament history with twelve or fewer points. UConn was involved in four of them. On three occasions, involving Southern University in 2010, Long Island University in 2001, and Temple in 2010, the Huskies held their opponents to twelve or fewer points. However, on this day, Connecticut would be on the opposite side of the ledger, scoring only 12 points against Stanford in the first half. The first two minutes gave no indication of this result. UConn held a 5–0 lead just over two minutes into the game, but they would not score again until after the media timeout with under eight minutes to go in the half. Connecticut hit but 5 of their 29 shot attempts in the first half for a shooting percentage of 17% described by the New York Times as \"laughable\". However, their inability to hit a basket did not prevent them from playing defense, and they held the Cardinal to 8 baskets on 31 shots, a percentage the Times called \"abysmal\". Stanford ended the half with an 8-point lead.\nThe second half proved to be very different. UConn scored 17 of the first 19 points in the half and took a lead. They held Ogwumike, who had scored 38 points in the semifinal, to eleven points. They held Jayne Appel, one of the nation's leading centers, to zero points on 0–12 shooting. Appel was playing on a sore ankle that required pain killers during the game. Maya Moore scored 23 points for UConn and Tina Charles contributed eleven rebounds. In the end, Connecticut won 53–47 to win their seventh national championship and complete the first back-to-back undefeated seasons in NCAA history.\n2010 NCAA Tournament schedule and venues.\nFirst and Second rounds (Subregionals)\nThe format is the same as the Men's Tournament, except that there are 64 teams and no play-in game. There are 31 automatic bids for conference champions and 33 at-large bids available.\nThe subregionals, based on the \"pod system\" keeping teams at or close to home, will be at these locations from March 21 through 24. Prior to the committee's decision to expand the number of subregional sites to sixteen, eight sites were chosen. This list included the Sun National Bank Center in Trenton, New Jersey. When the decision was made to increase the number of sites to sixteen, Trenton declined to participate.\nThe remaining seven sites continue to be part of the final list of sixteen:\nAs per the expansion of the subregional sites, these nine sites were added in 2008:\nThat list included Albuquerque, but Albuquerque had to withdraw, due to construction issues. The NCAA added Stanford, as a replacement:\n\"Note: Unless otherwise indicated, all locations are on-campus sites.\"\nSweet Sixteen and Elite Eight (Regional semifinals and finals)\nThe Regionals, named for the city rather than the region of geographic importance since 2005, which will be held from March 28 to 31, will be at these sites:\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and championship)\nThis is the second time the women's Final Four will be played in San Antonio, having previously been played in the city in 2002.\nQualifying teams – automatic.\nSixty-four teams were selected to participate in the 2010 NCAA Tournament. Thirty-one conferences were eligible for an automatic bid to the 2010 NCAA tournament.\nQualifying teams – at-large.\nThirty-three additional teams were selected to complete the sixty-four invitations.\nBids by conference.\nThirty-one conferences earned an automatic bid. In nineteen cases, the automatic bid was the only representative from the conference. Thirty-three additional at-large teams were selected from twelve of the conferences.\nBids by state.\nThe sixty-four teams came from twenty-eight states, plus Washington, D.C. Tennessee had the most teams with six bids. Twenty-two states did not have any teams receiving bids.\nGame summaries.\nDayton region.\nFirst round.\nSixth seeded St. John's took on the eleventh seeded Ivy League champion Princeton. The Tigers had won their last 21 games, the nation's third longest win streak. While Princeton stayed close early, only down 15–12 at one time, they missed 15 of their next sixteen shots while St. John's pulled out to a sixteen-point halftime lead. The two teams played roughly evenly the second half, but the halftime lead was more than enough and the Red Storm prevailed 65–47.\nFourteenth seeded Louisiana Tech (La Tech) was returning to the NCAA Tournament after a three-year absence. Under Maggie Dixon award winning new coach Teresa Weatherspoon, the Lady Techsters took on third seeded Florida State. La tech started out strong, pulling out to a nine-point lead late in the first half, but the Seminoles fought back to a 40–40 tie at halftime. The score was close well into the second half, with Florida State holding onto a one-point lead with just under nine minutes to go, but the Seminoles gradually increased the lead to ten. Although the Lady Techsters cut the lead in half to 65–61 with just under two minutes left, they would not score again and Florida State would hit ten straight free throws in the closing minutes to win 75–61.\nKansas City region.\nFirst round.\nMichigan State's fifth year senior Aisha Jefferson had stomach problems from a pre-game meal severe enough to keep her hunched over the front of a trash can in the first half, but it wasn't enough to keep her out of the game. She scored 17 points along with nine rebounds to help lead the fifth seeded Spartans over 12 seed Bowling Green 72–62.\nThirteenth seeded Liberty tried to challenge fourth seeded Kentucky, scoring the first six points, and leading by as much as nine early, but Kentucky's freshman A'dia Mathies, scored 32 points to set a personal career high and an NCAA tournament record for Kentucky to help the Wildcats retake the lead. The Liberty Flames fought back, and had a slim two-point lead at halftime, but the Kentucky team, behind 26 of 36 free-throws, pulled ahead to win 83–77.\nMemphis region.\nFirst round.\nSeventh seeded LSU easily beat tenth seeded Hartford 60–39. This was Hartford's first at-large invitation to the NCAA Tournament, but without leading scorer Erica Beverly, lost to a season-ending injury, the Hawks were unable to stay with the Tigers. LSU held Hartford scoreless for nearly eight minutes, scoring 17 consecutive points to take an early lead they would never give up.\nTop seeded Tennessee defeated 16 seed Austin Peay 75–42. Playing at their home court \"The Summitt\", the Lady Vols scored 15 points before allowing a score by the Lady Govs.\nSecond-seeded Duke took on 15 seed Hampton in Cameron Indoor Stadium, the Blue Devils home court, where Duke had won twelve consecutive NCAA Tournament games. The Pirates managed to hold a slim lead in the early minutes of the game, but Duke quickly took over, moving out to a 40–14 halftime lead and winning easily 72–37.\nEighth seeded Dayton took on ninth seeded TCU in their first ever NCAA appearance. Early in the second half, it appeared that Dayton would only be playing one game, as they were behind by 18 points, 50–32. However, the Flyers did not fold, and hit a basket with one second left in the game to win by a single point 67–66.\nTwelve seed Marist scored the first seven points in their game against five seed Georgetown, which may have reminded fans of the way Marist played in 2007, coming to the tournament as a 13 seed, and knocking off Ohio State and Middle Tennessee to make it to the round of sixteen. Georgetown, which hasn't been to the tournament in 17 years, started slowly, but managed to hold a two-point lead at halftime. Georgetown's Monica McNutt hit back-to-back three-pointers to start a 13–0 run at the beginning of the second half. The Red Foxes would never close the gap, and Georgetown went on to win 62–42.\nFourth seed Baylor took on 13th seed Fresno State. Baylor's Brittney Griner returned to the floor, after sitting out a two-game suspension for hitting an opponent in a game. This was freshman Griner's first tournament, and she confessed to having jitters, but she controlled the lane, and help keep Fresno State from winning their first ever NCAA game. Baylor held a six-point lead at halftime, which they stretched out to a 69–55 final score.\nSacramento region.\nFirst round.\nA fifteen seed has never beaten a two seed in the NCAA Women's Tournament, but with under five minutes left in the first half, 15th seeded Portland State was ahead of the second seed Texas A&amp;M. The lead didn't last long, as the Aggies pulled to an eight-point lead at halftime, and extended the lead through the second half. Texas A&amp;M's Tanisha Smith just missed a triple double, with nine assist to go along with 17 points and 10 rebounds. The final score favored the Aggies 84–53.\nNormally, a four seed would be a large favorite against a 13 seed, but normally, the four seed isn't required to bench one of their players, and not just any player, but Andrea Riley, the third leading scorer in Division 1. Two years earlier, Riley had thrown punch in an NCAA game, which earned her a one-game suspension. NCAA rules required that it be an NCAA game. Oklahoma State lost the game in which the punch was thrown, and did not make it to the Tournament in 2009, so the suspension was served two years later. The 13th seeded Chattanooga tried to take advantage of the situation, and led by as much as 18 in the first half. Riley could only cheer on the team from the bench. Freshman Toni Young responded by scoring 22 points, and senior Tegan Cunningham, after struggling in the first half, began hitting in the second half and ended up with 25 points, enough to help Oklahoma State win 70–63.\nThe 8/9 match-up between Iowa and Rutgers pitted current Rutgers coach C. Vivian Stringer against the program she helped bring to national prominence two decades earlier. Iowa had lost a game in the Big Ten tournament, after a big lead, and they didn't want to experience that again. Rutgers played even with the Hawkeyes, in the second half, but the seven point halftime lead stood up and Iowa won 70–63.\nSeventh seed Gonzaga took on tenth seeded North Carolina. Gonzaga's Tiffanie Shives was scoreless for 31 minutes, but then scored 14 in the next five minutes. Her first basket cut the Tarheels lead to two, and her next basket gave Gonzaga a lead they would not relinquish, although North Carolina cut the lead to one with under four minutes to go, only to fall short 82–76.\nTwelfth seed Tulane stayed with fifth seed Georgia for 32 minutes, in a game with five lead changes and four ties, but then the Bulldogs went on an 18–2 run to take the lead for good. Georgia's Ashley Houts would score 22 points for the winning team, and teammate Angel Robinson had a double-double (18 points, 13 rebounds) to help lead the Bulldogs over the Green Wave 64–59.\nThe last time Stanford was a number 1 seed, they became to only top seed in the men's or women's tournament to lose to a sixteen seed. Earlier in the day, the top seeded men's team, Kansas, lost to Northern Iowa, so no one felt safe in the opening match against UC Riverside. Stanford jumped out to an 8–0 lead, and behind Ogwumike's double-double (19 points, 11 rebounds) won easily over the Big West champion 79–47.\nBrackets.\nResults to date \"(* indicates game went to overtime)\":\nRecord by conference.\nEighteen conferences went 0–1: the Atlantic Sun, Big Sky, Big South, Big West, Colonial, Conference USA, Ivy League, MAAC, MEAC, MAC, Missouri Valley, Northeast, Ohio Valley, Patriot, Southern, Southland, SWAC and Summit.\nMedia coverage.\nTelevision.\nESPN had US television rights to all games during the tournament. For the first and second round, ESPN aired select games nationally on ESPN or ESPNU. All other games were aired regionally on ESPN2 and streamed online via ESPN3. Most of the nation got whip-a-round coverage during this time, which allowed ESPN to rotate between the games and focus the nation on the one that was the closest. The regional semifinals were split between ESPN and ESPN2, and ESPN aired the regional finals, national semifinals, and championship match.\nCommentary teams.\n\"First &amp; Second Rounds Saturday/Monday\"\n\"Sweet Sixteen &amp; Elite Eight Saturday/Monday\"\n\"Final Four\"\n\"First &amp; Second Rounds Sunday/Tuesday\"\n\"Sweet Sixteen &amp; Elite Eight Sunday/Tuesday\"\n\"Championship\""

        "title": "History of cycling",
        "text": "Cycling quickly became an activity after bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and remains popular with more than a billion people worldwide used for recreation, transportation and sport.\nRacing.\nThe first documented cycling race was a 1,200 metre race held on May 31, 1868, at the Park of Saint-Cloud, Paris. It was won by expatriate Englishman James Moore who rode a bicycle with solid rubber tires. The first cycle race covering a distance between two cities was Paris–Rouen, also won by James Moore, who rode the 123 kilometres dividing both cities in 10 hours and 40 minutes.\nThe oldest established bicycle racing club in the United States is the St. Louis Cycling Club. Operating continuously since 1887, the club has sponsored races and timed distance events since its inception. Its members have included numerous national champions and Olympic team members.\nRecreation.\nCycling as recreation became organized shortly after racing did. In its early days, cycling brought the sexes together in an unchaperoned way, particularly after the 1880s when cycling became more accessible owing to the invention of the Rover Safety bicycle. Public cries of alarm at the prospect of moral chaos arose from this and from the evolution of women’s cycling attire, which grew progressively less enveloping and restrictive.\nOn 4 March 1915 the society for the construction of cycle paths in the Gooi and Eemland region in the Netherlands was founded. It is the last private “Cycle Path Society” that still exists today. Some people thought the increasing amount of motor traffic in the early 20th century was so dangerous for people cycling, especially those who rode as a leisure activity, that they wanted separate cycling infrastructure to be built. The routes would also not be connected to a route for motor traffic and mainly for recreation – so not the shortest routes, but the nicest routes.\nCommuting.\nPeople have been riding bicycles to work since the initial bicycle heyday of the 1890s. According to the website Bike to Work, this practice continued in the United States until the 1920s, when biking experienced a sharp drop, in part due to the growth of suburbs and the popularity of the car. In Europe, cycling to work continued to be common until the end of the 1950s.\nToday many people ride bikes to work for a variety of reasons including fitness, environmental concerns, convenience, frugality, and enjoyment. According to the US Census Bureau’s 2008 American Community Survey(ACS), on September 22, 2009, 0.55 percent of Americans use a bicycle as the primary means of getting to work. Some places of employment offer amenities to bike commuters, such as showers, changing rooms, indoor bike racks and other secure bike parking.\nTouring.\nMany cyclists wanted to use their machines to travel; some of them went around the world. Annie Londonderry did so in 1894–95, taking 15 months. Six Indian men cycled 71000 km around the world in the 1920s.\nThe cycling craze.\nWith four key aspects (steering, safety, comfort and speed) improved over the penny-farthing, bicycles became very popular among elites and the middle classes in Europe and North America in the middle and late 1890s. It was the first bicycle that was suitable for women, and as such became the \"freedom machine\" (as American feminist Susan B. Anthony called it), giving women \"a feeling of freedom and self-reliance\".\nThe Svea Velocipede with vertical pedal arrangement and locking hubs was introduced in 1892 by the Swedish engineers Fredrik Ljungström and Birger Ljungström. It attracted attention at the World's Fair and was produced in a few thousand units.\nBicycle historians often call this period the \"golden age\" or \"bicycle craze\". By the start of the 20th century, cycling had become an important means of transportation, and in the United States an increasingly popular form of recreation. Bicycling clubs for men and women spread across the U.S. and across European countries.\nChicago immigrant Adolph Schoeninger with his Western Wheel Works became the \"Ford of the Bicycle\" (ten years before Henry Ford) by copying Pope's mass production methods and by introducing stamping to the production process in place of machining, significantly reducing production costs, and thus prices. His \"Crescent\" bicycles thus became affordable for working people, and massive exports from the United States lowered prices in Europe.\nThe Panic of 1893 wiped out many American manufacturers who had not followed the lead of Pope and Schoeninger, in the same way that the Great Depression would ruin car makers who did not follow Ford.\nWomen's cycling.\nThe impact of the bicycle on female emancipation should not be underestimated. The safety bicycle gave women unprecedented mobility, contributing to their larger participation in the lives of Western nations. As bicycles became safer and cheaper, more women had access to the personal freedom they embodied, and so the bicycle came to symbolise the New Woman of the late nineteenth century, especially in Britain and the United States. Feminists and suffragists recognised its transformative power. Susan B. Anthony said, \"Let me tell you what I think of bicycling. I think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance. I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel...the picture of free, untrammeled womanhood.\"\nIn 1895 Frances Willard, the tightly laced president of the Women’s Christian Temperance Union, wrote a book called \"How I Learned to Ride the Bicycle\" (described in \"Bicycling\" magazine as \"the greatest book ever written on learning to ride\"), in which she praised the bicycle she learned to ride late in life, and which she named \"Gladys\", for its \"gladdening effect\" on her health and political optimism. Willard used a cycling metaphor to urge other suffragists to action, proclaiming, \"I would not waste my life in friction when it could be turned into momentum.\" Elizabeth Robins Pennell started cycling in the 1870s in Philadelphia, and from the 1880s onwards brought out a series of travelogues about her cycling journeys around Europe, from \"A Canterbury Pilgrimage\" to \"Over the Alps on a Bicycle\". In 1895 Annie Londonderry became the first woman to bicycle around the world.\nThe backlash against the New (bicycling) Woman was demonstrated when the male undergraduates of Cambridge University in England chose to show their opposition to the admission of women as full members of the university by hanging a woman in effigy in the main town square—tellingly, a woman on a bicycle—as late as 1897.\nSince women could not cycle in the then-current fashions for voluminous and restrictive dress, the bicycle craze fed into a movement for so-called rational dress, which helped liberate women from corsets and ankle-length skirts and other encumbering garments, substituting the then-shocking bloomers."

        "title": "History of ice hockey",
        "text": "Ice hockey is believed to have evolved from simple stick and ball games played in the 18th and 19th centuries in Britain, Ireland, and elsewhere, primarily bandy, hurling, and shinty. The North American sport of lacrosse was also influential. These games were brought to North America and several similar winter games using informal rules developed, such as shinny and ice polo, but were later absorbed into a new organized game with codified rules which today is ice hockey.\nName.\nIn England, field hockey has historically been called simply \"hockey\" and was what was referenced by first appearances in print. The first known mention spelled as \"hockey\" occurred in the 1772 book \"Juvenile Sports and Pastimes, to Which Are Prefixed, Memoirs of the Author: Including a New Mode of Infant Education\", by Richard Johnson (Pseud. Master Michel Angelo), whose chapter XI was titled \"New Improvements on the Game of Hockey\". The 1527 Statute of Galway banned a sport called hokie'—the hurling of a little ball with sticks or staves\". A form of this word was thus being used in the 16th century, though much removed from its current usage.\nThe belief that hockey was mentioned in a 1363 proclamation by King Edward III of England is based on modern translations of the proclamation, which was originally in Latin and explicitly forbade the games .\nAccording to the Austin Hockey Association, the word \"puck\" derives from the Scottish Gaelic or the Irish ('to poke, punch or deliver a blow'). \"...The blow given by a hurler to the ball with his or hurley is always called a puck.\"\nPrecursors.\nStick-and-ball games themselves are very ancient. Games such as polo are known to have taken place in the pre-Christian era in Persia. In Europe, these games included the Irish game of hurling, the closely related Scottish game of shinty and versions of field hockey (including bandy ball, played in England). IJscolf, a game resembling colf on an ice-covered surface, was popular in the Low Countries between the Middle Ages and the Dutch Golden Age. It was played with a wooden curved bat (called a \"colf\" or \"kolf\"), a wooden or leather ball and two poles (or nearby landmarks), with the objective to hit the chosen point using the fewest strokes. A similar game (\"\") had been played for a thousand years or more by the Scandinavian peoples, as documented in the Icelandic sagas. Polo has been referred to as \"hockey on horseback\". In England, field hockey developed in the late 17th century, and there is evidence that some games of field hockey took place on the ice. These games of \"hockey on ice\" were sometimes played with a bung (a plug of cork or oak used as a stopper on a barrel). William Pierre Le Cocq stated, in a 1799 letter written in Chesham, England:\nA 1797 engraving unearthed by Swedish sport historians Carl Gidén and Patrick Houda shows a person on skates with a stick and bung on the River Thames, probably in December 1796.\nBritish soldiers and immigrants to Canada and the United States brought their stick-and-ball games with them and played them on the ice and snow of winter.\nIn 1825, John Franklin wrote \"The game of hockey played on the ice was the morning sport\" on Great Bear Lake near the town of Délı̨nę during one of his Arctic expeditions. A mid-1830s watercolour portrays New Brunswick lieutenant-governor Archibald Campbell and his family with British soldiers on skates playing a stick-on-ice sport. Captain R.G.A. Levinge, a British Army officer in New Brunswick during Campbell's time, wrote about \"hockey on ice\" on Chippewa Creek (a tributary of the Niagara River) in 1839. In 1843 another British Army officer in Kingston, Ontario, wrote, \"Began to skate this year, improved quickly and had great fun at hockey on the ice.\" An 1859 \"Boston Evening Gazette\" article referred to an early game of hockey on ice in Halifax that year. An 1835 painting by John O'Toole depicts skaters with sticks and bung on a frozen stream in the American state of West Virginia, at that time still part of Virginia.\nIn that same era, the Mi'kmaq, a First Nations people of the Canadian Maritimes, also had a stick-and-ball game. Canadian oral histories describe a traditional stick-and-ball game played by the Mi'kmaq, and Silas Tertius Rand (in his 1894 \"Legends of the Micmacs\") describes a Mi'kmaq ball game known as . Rand also describes a game played (probably after European contact) with hurleys, known as . was the name used by the Mi'kmaq to describe their own stick and ball game which they played on the ice while was what the Mi'kmaq called the new the game of \"hurley on ice\" which was played by others around the province during the same period. Of particular note among influential Mi'kmaqs is Joe Cope (\"Old Joe\"), a Mi'kmaq elder known for his talent for carving what became one of the earliest types of ice hockey sticks used. Cope once stated, \"Long before the pale faces strayed to this country, the Mi'kmaqs were playing two ball games, a field game and an ice game.\" Sticks made by the Mi'kmaq were used by the British for their games.\nEarly 19th-century paintings depict shinny, an early form of hockey with no standard rules which was played in Nova Scotia. Many of these early games absorbed the physical aggression of what the Onondaga called \"\" (lacrosse). Shinny was played on the St. Lawrence River at Montreal and Quebec City, and in Kingston and Ottawa. The number of players was often large. To this day, shinny (derived from the Scottish game of shinty) is a popular Canadian term for an informal type of hockey, either ice or street hockey.\nThomas Chandler Haliburton, in \"The Attache: Second Series\" (published in 1844) imagined a dialogue, between two of the novel's characters, which mentions playing \"hurly on the long pond on the ice\". This has been interpreted by some historians from Windsor, Nova Scotia as reminiscent of the days when the author was a student at King's College School in that town in 1810 and earlier. Based on Haliburton's quote, claims were made that modern hockey was invented in Windsor, Nova Scotia, by King's College students and perhaps named after an individual (\"Colonel Hockey's game\"). Others claim that the origins of hockey come from games played in the area of Dartmouth and Halifax in Nova Scotia. However, several references have been found to hurling and shinty being played on the ice long before the earliest references from both Windsor and Dartmouth/Halifax, and the word \"hockey\" was used to designate a stick-and-ball game at least as far back as 1773, as it was mentioned in the book \"Juvenile Sports and Pastimes, to Which Are Prefixed, Memoirs of the Author: Including a New Mode of Infant Education\" by Richard Johnson (Pseud. Master Michel Angelo), whose chapter XI was titled \"New Improvements on the Game of Hockey\".\nInitial development.\nThe city of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, became the center of the development of contemporary ice hockey, and is recognized as the birthplace of organized ice hockey. On March 3, 1875, the first organized indoor game was played at Montreal's Victoria Skating Rink between two nine-player teams, including James Creighton and several McGill University students. Instead of a ball or bung, the game featured a \"flat circular piece of wood\" (to keep it in the rink and to protect spectators). The goal posts were apart (today's goals are wide). Some observers of the game at McGill made quick note of its surprisingly aggressive and violent nature.\nIn 1876, games played in Montreal were \"conducted under the 'Hockey Association' rules\"; the Hockey Association was England's field hockey organization. In 1877, \"The Gazette\" (Montreal) published a list of seven rules, six of which were largely based on six of the Hockey Association's twelve rules, with only minor differences (even the word \"ball\" was kept); the one added rule explained how disputes should be settled. The McGill University Hockey Club, the first ice hockey club, was founded in 1877 (followed by the Quebec Hockey Club in 1878 and the Montreal Victorias in 1881). In 1880, the number of players per side was reduced from nine to seven.\nThe number of teams grew, enough to hold the first \"world championship\" of ice hockey at Montreal's annual Winter Carnival in 1883. The McGill team won the tournament and was awarded the Carnival Cup. The game was divided into thirty-minute halves. The positions were now named: left and right wing, centre, rover, point and cover-point, and goaltender. In 1886, the teams competing at the Winter Carnival organized the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC), and played a season comprising \"challenges\" to the existing champion.\nIn Europe, it was previously believed that in 1885 the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club was formed to play the first Ice Hockey Varsity Match against traditional rival Cambridge in St. Moritz, Switzerland; however, this is now considered to have been a game of bandy. A similar claim which turned out to be accurate is that the oldest rivalry in ice hockey history is between Queen's University at Kingston and Royal Military College of Kingston, Ontario, with the first known match taking place in 1886.\nIn 1888, the Governor General of Canada, The Lord Stanley of Preston, first attended the Montreal Winter Carnival tournament and was impressed with the game. His sons and his daughter, Isobel Stanley, were hockey enthusiasts. In 1892, realizing that there was no recognition for the best team in Canada (although a number of leagues had championship trophies), he purchased a silver bowl for use as a trophy. The Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup (which later became known as the Stanley Cup) was first awarded in 1893 to the Montreal Hockey Club, champions of the AHAC; it continues to be awarded annually to the National Hockey League's championship team. Stanley's son Arthur helped organize the Ontario Hockey Association, and Stanley's daughter Isobel was one of the first women to play ice hockey.\nBy 1893, there were almost a hundred teams in Montreal alone; in addition, there were leagues throughout Canada. Winnipeg hockey players used cricket pads to better protect the goaltender's legs; they also introduced the \"scoop\" shot, or what is now known as the wrist shot. William Fairbrother, from Ontario, Canada, is credited with inventing the ice hockey net in the 1890s. Goal nets became a standard feature of the Canadian Amateur Hockey League in 1900. Left and right defence began to replace the point and cover-point positions in the OHA in 1906.\nAmerican financier Malcolm Greene Chace is credited with being the father of hockey in the United States. In 1892, Chace put together a team of men from Yale, Brown, and Harvard, and toured across Canada as captain of this team. The first collegiate hockey match in the United States was played between Yale and Johns Hopkins in Baltimore in 1893. In 1896, the first ice hockey league in the US was formed. The US Amateur Hockey League was founded in New York City, shortly after the opening of the artificial-ice St. Nicholas Rink.\nBy 1898 the following leagues had already formed: the Amateur Hockey League of New York, the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada, and the Ontario Hockey Association. The 1898 Spalding Athletic Library book includes rules and results for each league.\nStanley's five sons were instrumental in bringing ice hockey to Europe, defeating a court team (which included the future Edward VII and George V) at Buckingham Palace in 1895. By 1903, a five-team league had been founded. The was founded in 1908 to govern international competition, and the first European championship was won by Great Britain in 1910. The sport grew further in Europe in the 1920s, after ice hockey became an Olympic sport. Many bandy players switched to hockey to be able to compete in the Olympics. In the mid-20th century, the became the International Ice Hockey Federation.\nAs the popularity of ice hockey as a spectator sport grew, earlier rinks were replaced by larger rinks. Most of the early indoor ice rinks have been demolished; Montreal's Victoria Rink, built in 1862, was demolished in 1925. Many older rinks succumbed to fire, such as Denman Arena, Dey's Arena, Quebec Skating Rink and Montreal Arena, a hazard of the buildings' wood construction. The Stannus Street Rink in Windsor, Nova Scotia (built in 1897) may be the oldest still in existence; however, it is no longer used for hockey. The Aberdeen Pavilion (built in 1898) in Ottawa was used for hockey in 1904 and is the oldest existing facility that has hosted Stanley Cup games.\nThe oldest indoor ice hockey arena still in use today for hockey is Boston's Matthews Arena, which was built in 1910. It has been modified extensively several times in its history and is used today by Northeastern University for hockey and other sports. It was the original home rink of the Boston Bruins professional team, itself the oldest United States-based team in the NHL, starting play in the league in what was then called Boston Arena on December 1, 1924. Madison Square Garden in New York City, built in 1968, is the oldest continuously-operating arena in the NHL.\nProfessional era.\nWhile scattered incidents of players taking pay to play hockey occurred as early as the 1890s, those found to have done so were banned from playing in the amateur leagues which dominated the sport. By 1902, the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League (WPHL) was the first to employ professionals. The league joined with teams in Michigan and Ontario to form the first fully professional league—the International Professional Hockey League (IPHL)—in 1904. The WPHL and IPHL hired players from Canada; in response, Canadian leagues began to pay players (who played with amateurs). The IPHL, cut off from its largest source of players, disbanded in 1907. By then, several professional hockey leagues were operating in Canada (with leagues in Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec).\nIn 1910, the National Hockey Association (NHA) was formed in Montreal. The NHA further refined the rules: dropping the rover position, dividing the game into three 20-minute periods and introducing minor and major penalties. After re-organizing as the National Hockey League in 1917, the league expanded into the United States, starting with the Boston Bruins in 1924.\nProfessional hockey leagues developed later in Europe, but amateur leagues leading to national championships were in place. One of the first was the Swiss National League A, founded in 1916. Today, professional leagues have been introduced in most countries of Europe. Top European leagues include the Kontinental Hockey League, the Czech Extraliga, the Finnish SM-liiga and the Swedish Hockey League."

        "text": "The 2011 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament began on March 19, 2011, and concluded on April 5, 2011. The Texas A&amp;M Aggies won the championship, defeating the Notre Dame Fighting Irish 76–70 in the final held at Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.\nThe tournament was also notable for a historic run by Gonzaga that ultimately ended in the final of the Spokane Region. With the help of two games on their home court and a regional held less than two miles away, the #11-seeded Bulldogs became the lowest seed ever to make a regional final in the history of the women's tournament.\nTournament procedure.\nPending any changes to the format, a total of 64 teams will enter the 2011 tournament. 32 automatic bids shall be awarded to each program that wins their conference's tournament. The remaining 36 bids are \"at-large\", with selections extended by the NCAA Selection Committee. The tournament is split into four regional tournaments, and each regional has teams seeded from 1 to 16, with the committee ostensibly making every region as comparable to the others as possible. The top-seeded team in each region plays the #16 team, the #2 team plays the #15, etc. (meaning where the two seeds add up to 17, that team will be assigned to play another).\nThe basis for the subregionals returned to the approach used between 1982 and 2002; the top sixteen teams, as chosen in the bracket selection process, hosted the first two rounds on campus.\nThe Selection Committee will also seed the entire field from 1 to 64. \n2011 NCAA Tournament schedule and venues.\nThere were 64 teams in the tournament, placed in a seeded bracket with four regions. Thirty-two teams received automatic bids – thirty-one of which were their conference tournament champions; the other was for the Ivy League regular-season champion. An additional 32 teams were given at-large bids by the selection committee on the basis of their body of work during the regular season. Unlike the Men's Tournament, there was no \"First Four\" round. \nFirst and Second rounds (Subregionals)\nSubregionals were played from March 19 through March 22.\nThe following 16 sites were used for first and second-round games:\nRegional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nThe Regionals, named for the city rather than the region of geographic importance since 2005, which were held from March 26 to March 29, were at these sites:\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and national championship)\nThis was the second time that Indianapolis hosted a Women's Final Four Basketball tournament; the prior times were in 2005 as per the NCAA's policy of hosting one of each of the men's and women's Final Four every five years in the home city of the NCAA offices.\nQualifying teams – automatic.\nSixty-four teams were selected to participate in the 2011 NCAA Tournament. Thirty-one conferences were eligible for an automatic bid to the 2011 NCAA tournament.

        "title": "Maryland Terrapins men's basketball",
        "text": "The Maryland Terrapins men's basketball team represents the University of Maryland in National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I competition. Maryland, a founding member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), left the ACC in 2014 to join the Big Ten Conference. Gary Williams, who coached the Terrapins from 1989 to 2011, led the program to its greatest success, including two consecutive Final Fours in 2001 and 2002, which culminated in the 2002 NCAA National Championship. Maryland has appeared in 30 NCAA tournaments and won their conference tournament 4 times. The Terrapins have competed in 100 seasons, accumulating an overall record of 1,641–1,086 as of the 2022–23 season. Maryland is currently coached by Kevin Willard.\nThe Terrapins played in what many consider to be the greatest Atlantic Coast Conference game in history — and one of the greatest college basketball games ever — the championship of the 1974 ACC men's basketball tournament, in which they lost 103–100 in overtime to eventual national champion North Carolina State. The game was instrumental in forcing the expansion of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship, thus allowing for at-large bids and the inclusion of more than one team per conference. That Maryland team, with six future NBA draft picks, is considered by many to be the greatest team not to have participated in the NCAA tournament.\nHistory.\nEarly years – the H. Burton Shipley era.\nBefore basketball became a permanent fixture in College Park, the school—then known as Maryland Agricultural College—met with little success in its intermittent attempts to establish a basketball team. A team first appeared in 1904–05, playing only two games in an intramural/club setting. Games were played sporadically during the 1910–1911, 1912–13, 1913–1914, and the 1918–1919 seasons, going a combined 7–36. Basketball returned to stay for the 1923–24 season, when the school convinced former star quarterback H. Burton Shipley, who had been coaching at the University of Delaware, to come back to his alma mater. The Old Liners, as they were then known, joined the Southern Conference in their inaugural season. The team met with moderate success that year at 5–7 and also played its first games against future ACC rivals North Carolina and Virginia. The Old Liners had their first sustained success over the next four seasons, finishing at or above .500 in each of them and putting together an outstanding 24–9 record against Southern Conference foes. The Aggies also played their first games against what would become their two other biggest rivals in the future during that time, North Carolina State and Duke.\nThe school's biggest success during its formative years took place in the early 1930s, around the time it adopted its current nickname, Terrapins. After finishing second in the conference in 1930–31, Maryland won the Southern Conference tournaments, beating Louisiana State, North Carolina, Georgia, and Kentucky over five days, a feat they followed by winning the conference regular season crown the next year. The team also had its first individual star in Louis \"Bosey\" Berger who was named to All-America teams both seasons. It was during this stretch that the school erected a new home for its basketball teams, Ritchie Coliseum, which housed the team until Cole Field House replaced it a quarter of a century later.\nAlthough the team would remain competitive throughout the rest of the decade, finishing as high as second in the conference regular season, it never again matched its achievements of the early part of the decade, and as the 1940s began, the school's basketball team fell on exceedingly hard times. Shipley tallied just one winning season in his last seven years before stepping down to focus on coaching the baseball team, a post he'd held for his entire tenure since returning to College Park. He was succeeded by Flucie Stewart. In what would become a long-running pattern at Maryland when a long-tenured head coach stepped down, Stewart would not last very long, putting together three losing seasons in three tries during his brief time at Maryland.\nThe Bud Millikan era and the ACC.\nThe 1950s began with a new head coach leading the way, Bud Millikan. A disciple of legendary coach Henry Iba, Millikan's emphasis on defense and fundamentals would become hallmarks of the program over the next two decades. Maryland quickly reeled off seven straight winning seasons under Millikan. For the 1953–54 season, the team joined North Carolina, North Carolina State, Duke, Wake Forest, Virginia, Clemson, and South Carolina in leaving the SoCon for the newly formed Atlantic Coast Conference. That season was perhaps the finest the Terrapins had experienced to date, finishing with a 23–7 record and a conference mark good enough for second in the league. Maryland experienced its first games as a ranked team, spending the final nine weeks of the season ranked in the AP Top 20, peaking at No. 11 before settling for a final ranking of #20. It also featured the school's first win over a ranked team when it beat local rival George Washington, then-number 7 in the country. The team was led by its second All-American, Gene Shue, who was honored in both that season and the prior year.\nAfter that season, the team remained the only school outside of the North Carolina \"Big Four\" – Duke, UNC, North Carolina State, and Wake Forest – to consistently field competitive teams. In the ACC's second year, the Terps cracked the top ten for the first time, peaking at No. 6 in January before eventually finishing the season with a disappointing one-point loss to Virginia in the ACC tournament quarterfinal round.\nThe Terps had another breakout season during the 1957–58 season. After a good regular season (17–6, 4th in the ACC), Maryland stunned the league by winning the ACC tournament, including wins over #6 Duke and #13 North Carolina on back to back days to capture the title as well as the league's berth in the NCAA tournament. The team routed Boston College 86–63 at Madison Square Garden with just two days of rest after the ACC tournament, advancing to the East Regionals in Charlotte. The Terps lost a tight game to Temple in the round of 16 before beating Manhattan in the consolation game to secure third place in the East.\nThat would be the high-water mark for the Terps under Millikan. They experienced their first losing season under the coach the next season, although they did manage to finish third in the ACC, including its first ever win over a #1 ranked team when it beat North Carolina 69–51 in Cole Field House on February 21. By 1962–63, the bottom had dropped out and the Terps finished just 3–11 in the ACC, next to last in the standings. While Millikan managed to turn the program around in the mid-1960s, finishing in a second place tie in 1964–65 and above .500 overall again the next season, the feeling in College Park was that the game had passed the coach by, and he was replaced after the following season by assistant Frank Fellows. Fellows' tenure lasted just two seasons, both of which featured only eight wins.\nThe Lefty Driesell era.\nIn 1969, Charles \"Lefty\" Driesell was hired by the University of Maryland. During his introductory press conference, he made the bold statement that he wanted to make Maryland the \"UCLA of the East\". At that time, UCLA was the nation's dominant college basketball program. While Driesell did not elevate Maryland to UCLA's heights, he did lead the Terrapins to eight NCAA tournament appearances, a National Invitation Tournament championship, two Atlantic Coast Conference regular season championships, and one Atlantic Coast Conference tournament championship. Maryland also attained a No. 2 Associated Press ranking during four consecutive seasons from 1972 to 1976.\nDriesell coached the Maryland Terrapins from 1969 to 1986. During his tenure, he successfully recruited numerous exceptional players, including Tom McMillen, Len Elmore, John Lucas, Albert King, Buck Williams, and Len Bias. In 1974, he signed perhaps the best college prospect of his career, future basketball Hall of Famer Moses Malone, but Malone chose instead to go to a professional basketball franchise, the Utah Stars. Malone was the first player in the modern era to proceed directly from high school into professional basketball, deciding on the day classes were scheduled to begin.\nAt Maryland, Driesell began the now nationwide tradition of Midnight Madness. According to longstanding NCAA rules, college basketball teams were not permitted to begin practices until October 15. Driesell traditionally began the first practice with a requirement that his players run one mile in six minutes, but found that the players were too fatigued to practice effectively immediately afterwards. At 12:03 a.m. on October 15, 1971, Driesell held a one-mile run at the track around Byrd Stadium, where a crowd of 1,000 fans had gathered after learning of the unorthodox practice session. The event soon became a tradition to build excitement for the basketball team's upcoming season.\nIn 1972, Maryland defeated Niagara, 100–69 to secure the National Invitation Tournament championship. Driesell said that the season attained the three goals he had set for the program at the time of his hiring: \"national prominence\", \"national ranking\", and \"a national championship\".\nOn July 12, 1973, Driesell saved the lives of at least ten children from several burning buildings. He and two other men were surf fishing around midnight in Bethany Beach, Delaware when he saw flames coming from a seashore resort. Driesell broke down a door and rescued several children from the fire that eventually destroyed four townhouses. An eyewitness, Prince George's County circuit court Judge Samuel Meloy, said, \"Let's face it, Driesell was a hero. There were no injuries and it was a miracle because firemen didn't come for at least 30 minutes.\" Driesell said, \"Don't build me up as any kind of hero. All we did was try to get the kids out. It was just lucky that we were fishing right in front of the houses.\" For these actions, Driesell was awarded the NCAA Award of Valor.\nIn 1974, the No. 4 Terrapins played in what many consider one of the greatest college basketball games of all time, losing the ACC men's basketball tournament 103–100 in overtime to eventual national champion and No. 1 North Carolina State. Each team only played seven players each, and eight of those 14 went on to be NBA Draft picks, including six from Maryland. The game included 91 field goals made on 157 attempts between the teams, in spite of top-level defense being played. \"We didn't score 100 points or they didn't because we were sorry defensive teams. (N.C. State) had a 7-foot-4 center\" in Tommy Burleson, said Lefty Driesell. \"We had (Len) Elmore, who was one of the best shot-blockers ever to play in the league.\" After the game, the Greensboro, N.C. crowd, traditionally unfriendly to non-North Carolina ACC teams, gave both teams a standing ovation. After the loss, Maryland declined an invitation to the NIT. Maryland's team was considered by many to be the greatest team not to have participated in the NCAA tournament because, at the time, only the winner of a conference tournament would earn a bid. It was Maryland's exclusion that finally forced an expansion to allow at-large bids and more than one team per conference.\nDriesell's legacy will forever be tied to one of Maryland's greatest players and one of the best college basketball players of all time, Len Bias, who played under Driesell from 1982 to 1986. As a freshman, Bias was viewed as \"raw and undisciplined\", but ultimately developed into an All-American player who impressed basketball fans with his amazing leaping ability, his physical stature and his ability to create plays, and was considered one of the most dynamic players in the nation. In 1984, Driesell and Bias led the team to the school's second ACC tournament Championship. In Bias's junior year, he led the ACC in scoring, was named the ACC Player of the Year, and was a consensus second-team All-American while averaging 18.9 points and 6.8 rebounds per game. His senior season was highlighted by his performance in an overtime victory against top-ranked North Carolina in which he scored 35 points, including 7 in the last 3 minutes of regulation and 4 in overtime. At the end of the year, Bias collected his second ACC Player of the Year award and was a consensus first-team All American while averaging 23.2 points and 7 rebounds per game. Scouts from various NBA teams viewed Bias as the most complete forward in the class of 1986 and was widely considered to be of equal talent to Michael Jordan, who played at North Carolina from 1981 to 1984. \"Over the years, you've heard a lot of people say it was that jumper that separated him from Michael Jordan — and could have potentially made him a better player than Jordan in the pros,\" said Keith Gatlin, who was the starting point guard on the school's 1985-1986 team and lived with Bias. Together, Bias and Driesell made four straight NCAA tournaments, making the Sweet 16 in 1984 and 1985.\nOn June 19, 1986, Bias tragically died of a cocaine-induced heart attack shortly after being drafted by the Boston Celtics as the No. 2 overall selection. An investigation revealed that Bias was 21 credits short of the graduation requirement despite having used all his athletic eligibility. In October, a university panel found that the basketball staff had stressed athletics over academics. On October 29, Driesell resigned as head coach and took a position as an assistant athletic director. He also worked as a television analyst during college basketball games. Some members of the media widely described Driesell as a scapegoat of chancellor John B. Slaughter and the university administration.\nIn 2018, Coach Driesell was finally inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nTop of the mountain: the Gary Williams era.\nThe Maryland Terrapins announced Maryland alumnus Gary Williams as its next head coach on June 13, 1989. The basketball program and the Maryland athletic program as a whole were still reeling from the aftershock of the 1986 death of Maryland basketball star Len Bias and struggles under coach Bob Wade, a former high school coach from Baltimore. Williams was coming off a successful stint at Ohio State featuring one NCAA tournament appearance and two NIT appearances in three seasons. Williams played for Maryland as the starting point guard under coach Bud Millikan. He was a member of the 1966 Charlotte Invitational Tournament championship team and the 1965 Sugar Bowl Tournament championship team. He set a Maryland record for field goal percentage, going 8-for-8 from the field in an ACC game against South Carolina in 1966. (35 years later a Williams pupil, Lonny Baxter, would break that record, hitting all ten of his field goal attempts.) Williams was the Maryland team captain in 1967. He graduated in 1968 with a B.S. in marketing.\nWilliams coached the 1989–90 squad to a respectable 18–13 record and an NIT berth. However, in March 1990, the NCAA imposed harsh sanctions on the school for several violations, mostly dating to the Wade era. Maryland was banned from postseason play in 1991 and 1992, and was kicked off live television for 1990–91. Additionally, Maryland docked itself several scholarships over two years. With his recruiting efforts severely hamstrung, Williams found it very difficult to rebuild the program. However, with the help of Walt Williams, Maryland stayed competitive through a low point of the program's history.\nAfter a surprise appearance in the 1994 Sweet 16, the Terrapins were a fixture in the national rankings until 2005. Maryland's teams during this era featured future NBA players such as Joe Smith, Steve Francis, Šarūnas Jasikevičius, Juan Dixon, Steve Blake, Lonny Baxter, Terence Morris, and Chris Wilcox, and a cast of supportive role players, exemplified by Byron Mouton.\nIn 2001, Williams led Maryland to the first Final Four in school history, losing to Duke in the semifinals despite leading by as much as 22 points in the first half and being up by 11 at half. Maryland fans largely attribute the loss to several controversial fouls that limited the Terps' defense, including a phantom fifth foul on Lonnie Baxter with 2:48 remaining. The Final Four loss to Duke was the fourth meeting between the two schools during the season, which included each team winning on the other's home court. Duke's win at Cole Field House is known as the \"Gone in 54 Seconds\" game, after Duke came back to win despite being down 10 points with under a minute left. The Terps got their revenge by winning on Shane Battier's senior night at Cameron Indoor Stadium before losing to Duke by two points in the ACC tournament semifinals on a tip-in shot with 1.3 seconds remaining.\nOn April 1, 2002, Williams led the Terrapins to their first NCAA National Championship, defeating Indiana 64–52. Maryland's historic run included wins against four straight former champions, including Kentucky in the Sweet 16, UConn in the Elite Eight, and Kansas in the Final Four. Williams was the first coach to win a national championship without a single McDonald's All American on the roster since its inception. He became the first coach to direct his alma mater to a national title since Norm Sloan accomplished the feat with North Carolina State in 1974. The 2002 team also won a school-record 32 games, as well as the school's first outright ACC title in 22 years—only the third time since 1981 that a team from North Carolina hadn't won at least a share of the title. Senior Juan Dixon was named the 2002 NCAA Final Four MVP, ACC Player of the Year, and finished his career as the school's all-time scoring leader. Steve Blake also produced what Maryland fans remember as the \"Oh He Steal\" game, when Blake memorably stole the ball from Duke's Jay Williams and scored just before halftime in front of a raucous home crowd. 2001-2002 was also the Terps' final season in historic Cole Field House, with Maryland going undefeated at their long-time home.\nIn 2004, having slipped to 7–9 in the ACC (the team's first sub-.500 conference record in more than a decade), the Terps upset the tournament's top three seeds to win its first ACC tournament title since 1984. In knocking off No. 15 Wake Forest (3 seed), No. 17 NC State (2), and No. 5 Duke (1), tournament MVP John Gilchrist dazzled. Gilchrist scored 16 points against a Chris Paul-led Wake Forest team, led a 21-point comeback against NC State by scoring 23 of his 30 points after halftime, and poured in another 26 points in a memorable 95–87 overtime victory over Duke in the final. Maryland's championship ended Duke's streak of five straight ACC championships.\nIn the 2004–05 season, Maryland failed to make the NCAA tournament for the first time since the 1993–1994 season, which was then the longest streak in the ACC. This began a relatively mediocre stretch for Maryland, where they failed to make the tournament three out of the next five years. Maryland's best team in these years was 2006–07, when the team finished 25–9 (10–7 ACC) and ranked No. 18 in the final AP poll. Led by the once highly touted senior class of D. J. Strawberry, Mike Jones, Ekene Ibekwe, and Will Bowers, along with precocious freshman Greivis Vasquez, the Terps beat a Stephen Curry-led Davidson squad in the first round of the NCAA tournament before narrowly missing the Sweet 16 when they fell to Butler 59–62, which shot 12-26 (46%) from 3. The 06-07 squad memorably beat Duke twice and won what many fans consider one of the loudest games at the then-named Comcast Center when they beat No. 5 North Carolina.\nThe 2009–10 Terrapins brought the swagger (and the shimmy) back to College Park when they won a share of the regular-season conference title with Duke. Senior Greivis Vasquez won ACC Player of the Year and consensus second team All American honors as he climbed to No. 2 all time in points and assists at Maryland, while Williams earned his second ACC Coach of the Year award. The season's highlights included Cliff Tucker's buzzer beating three pointer to defeat Georgia Tech at home (after Coach Williams called a timeout that unintentionally nullified what would have been a game-winning three by Vasquez) and a win over eventual national champion Duke on Vasquez's senior night. The Terrapins earned a 4 seed in the Midwest Regional of the NCAA tournament, where they handily beat Houston 89–77 in the first round. In the second round Maryland faced a tough 5th seeded Michigan State, coached by Tom Izzo and led on the court by Kalin Lucas and future NBA star Draymond Green. Behind Vasquez's 26 points, Maryland stormed back from 17 points down in the second half to take the lead in the final seconds before MSU's Korie Lucious hit a heartbreaking buzzer beater to sink the Terrapins 85–83. The loss especially hurt after the top seed in the region, Kansas, lost to 9 seed Northern Iowa, which opened a clear path to the Final Four. The 2009–2010 team was to be the last great Gary Williams team. The following season a group of promising freshmen and veteran holdovers from the 2009–2010 team failed to replicate the success of the prior season and the Terrapins struggled to a 19–14 mark, failing to make the post-season altogether for the first time since 1993.\nOn May 5, 2011, Gary Williams announced his decision to retire from coaching basketball. He remains involved with the Maryland athletic department as Assistant Athletic Director and Special Assistant to the athletic director. Gary Williams will always be treasured and remembered for saving his alma mater from the doldrums of the post-Bias era years and eventually building Maryland into a national champion. In honor of his legendary career, Maryland named its hardwood at the Xfinity Center \"Gary Williams Court\". In 2014, Coach Williams was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nB1G new world – the Mark Turgeon era.\nMark Turgeon had built a very respectable mid major program at Wichita State but ended with a disappointing year before beginning a successful spell in College Station with the Aggies in 2007.\nPrior to his last year at Texas A&amp;M, Turgeon had negotiated a contract extension and salary increase. On May 9, 2011, at 8pm, Turgeon met with his coaching staff and players to inform them that half an hour earlier he accepted the head coach position at the University of Maryland. He had visited the campus earlier that day and left with an offer. When asked about his decision at an Aggie Athletics press conference, he said \"Maryland's got a great basketball tradition. [Texas A&amp;M and Maryland are] real similar. It's a gut feeling.\" In their meeting earlier that night he told the Aggie players \"it was the hardest decision [he] ever had to make... because of [them].\" Turgeon said that fan attendance at A&amp;M did not factor into his decision.\nSince his arrival, Maryland students have adopted the phrase 'Fear the Turgeon,' a play on the school's motto, 'Fear the Turtle.' Some students, known as the \"Turgeonites\", have created a fan club for the coach and dress like him on game days.\nThe last ACC years: 2011–2014.\nTurgeon inherited an average roster featuring hardworking forward James Padgett, the well rounded Sean Mosley, sophomore point guard Pe'Shon Howard, and volume scorer Terrell Stoglin. Turgeon and his staff secured 4 star Baltimore freshman Nick Faust and the Ukrainian big man Alex Len. Turgeon captured his first win as the University of Maryland Head Coach on November 13, 2011, by defeating UNC Wilmington at the Comcast Center 71–62. Maryland struggled throughout the season and finished with a 17–15 overall record and a 6–10 mark in the ACC.\nThe 2012–13 team was a young team. Veteran Sean Mosley graduated and leading scorer Terrell Stoglin left the program. In the first example of what would become a Mark Turgeon staple, he cobbled together a roster with transfers and freshman and led the Terrapins to 25 wins and the NIT Semifinals. Alex Len became a breakout star averaging 11.9 points, 7.8 rebounds and 2.1 blocks per game, eventually being drafted 5th overall by the Phoenix Suns following the season. Xavier transfer Dez Wells would become a star in his three years in College Park. He led the team in scoring with 13.1 a game.\nFollowing Alex Len's decision to leave for the NBA, the Terps struggled through what would be their final ACC season falling back to a 17–15 record. In their final ACC regular season game, the Terrapins defeated the 5th ranked Virginia Cavaliers 75–69 in OT at the Comcast Center.\nRecent success 2014–present.\nIn November 2012 ESPN reported that the University of Maryland, a charter member of the ACC, was in \"serious negotiations\" to join the Big Ten. Yahoo! Sports confirmed the news, and added that Big East Conference member Rutgers University was also in advanced talks to join the Big Ten.\nThese reports noted that the Big Ten's then-current first-tier media rights deal was set to expire in 2017, and the conference was preparing for negotiations on a new deal. Both potential new members offered access to large new media markets for the conference. The ESPN report stated that Maryland was somewhat torn over the possible move from the ACC to the Big Ten. Two key players for Maryland in the negotiations, president Wallace Loh and athletic director Kevin Anderson, did not have ACC ties, and Loh was a former provost of Big Ten member Iowa. However, the chancellor of the University System of Maryland (USM) that ultimately oversees the school, Brit Kirwan, had been on the College Park campus for 30 years and, according to ESPN, had a strong affinity for the ACC. In addition, one of the Maryland regents told ESPN that Under Armour founder and major Maryland athletic booster Kevin Plank was \"100 percent\" behind a Big Ten move, and was heavily lobbying regents. On November 19, the Maryland regents voted to accept the Big Ten's offer, and the Big Ten presidents unanimously approved Maryland's entry later that day. The Terrapins officially joined in July 2014.\nThe athletic department was not in a strong financial position at the time. In July 2012, Maryland dropped seven varsity teams due to a deficit reported by The Washington Post as $4 million. In addition, the ACC voted earlier in 2012 to increase its exit fee to $50 million; the only two members to vote against the increase were Maryland and Florida State. Sources at Maryland believed that the school would be able to negotiate the buyout downward.\nThe 2014–15 Terrapins were led by senior star Dez Wells and freshman sensation Melo Trimble. Maryland won their first Big Ten basketball game in a 68–66 double overtime thriller at Michigan State. Maryland finished their first Big Ten season with a 14–4 record, finishing second. Turgeon was named Big Ten Coach of the Year. Maryland was selected as a 4 seed in the NCAA tournament. In the First Round Maryland defeated #13 Valparaiso 65–62. In the second round the Terps faced fifth seeded West Virginia and lost 69–59 after Melo Trimble got knocked out of the game with a concussion. Trimble was named a second-team All American by The Sporting News, and both he and Wells were named first team Big Ten.\nThe 2015–16 Terrapins entered the season with high expectations. Blue chip recruit Diamond Stone and transfers \nRobert Carter and Rasheed Sulaimon paired up with Melo Trimble and Jake Layman to create a formidable starting 5 for the Terps. The Terrapins were 11–1 entering conference play, featuring wins over Georgetown and UConn and a memorable, competitive 89–81 loss against eventual national runner-up North Carolina at the Dean Smith Center in the ACC/B1G challenge. Maryland got out to a 10–2 record in the Big Ten before losing 4 of the last 6 to finish 3rd in the conference with a 12–6 record. The Terps handled Nebraska 97–86 in the Big Ten tournament quarterfinals in Indianapolis. In the semifinal game the Terps were narrowly defeated by the Michigan State Spartans 64–61. For the NCAA tournament the Terrapins were selected as the No. 5 seed in the South region. They survived the South Dakota State Jackrabbits 79–74 in the first round. In the second round they defeated a Hawaii team hot off of an upset of the 4 seeded California Golden Bears 73–60. In the Sweet 16 they were ousted by a superior Kansas Jayhawks team 79–63. Altogether the 2015–2016 team is regarded as a disappointment given their preseason ranking and the fact that they only reached the Sweet 16. However they put Maryland back on the map nationally and showed that the program was going to be a force in the Big Ten.\nThe 2016–2017 squad entered the season with many questions. 1st team all Big-Ten point guard Melo Trimble was the only remaining starter, and only 3 other players received significant play time. Lack of depth allowed a freshman trio of Anthony Cowan Jr, Kevin Huerter, and Justin Jackson to start in almost every game. The team finished with a 24–9 season with a conference record of 12–6, finishing 3rd in the Big Ten. The team had many memorable close-fought games including the season finale against Michigan State, when Melo Trimble nailed a game winning 3 with under a second remaining. The team was deemed a 6 seed in the NCAA tournament, getting knocked out in the 1st round to 11 seed Xavier.\n2017–2018 saw the Terps without star point guard Melo Trimble but saw Anthony Cowan Jr, Kevin Huerter, and Justin Jackson returning for their sophomore seasons. Despite this and the emergence of star freshman power forward Bruno Fernando the terps struggled to an overall record of 19–13 and 8–10 in what was considered a weak Big Ten. The season featured many close road losses that followed a pattern. This season resulted in the Terps completely missing the postseason for the first time since the 2013–2014 season.\nThe 2018–2019 season team entered the season with high anticipation locally thanks to returning stars Cowan and Fernando, as well as the addition of the 7th ranked recruiting class in country starring consensus 5-star Jalen \"Stix\" Smith. Despite a young team, the Terps outperformed national expectations and maintained a top-25 ranking for the entire 2nd half of the season. Maryland finished the 2018-2019 campaign at 22–10 (13–7 in the Big Ten), garnering a #6 seed in the NCAA tournament. The Terps survived a close battle with Dylan Windler led Belmont before losing on the last possession of the game against LSU.\n2019–2020 will forever be remembered by the college basketball world as the year the NCAA tournament and most conference tournaments were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the Terps, the cancelled postseason hit especially hard with Turgeon assembling his strongest team at Maryland, which finished 24–7 and 14–6 in the Big Ten. Led by first-team All Big Ten selections Anthony Cowan Jr. and Jalen \"Stix\" Smith, the Terps won a three-way share of the Big Ten regular season conference title,along with Wisconsin and Michigan State the men's program's first conference title since 2010 and its first title in the Big Ten. The Terps were ranked in the AP top ten for 22 weeks during the season, being ranked as high as No. 3 in early December and ending the season at No. 12. The season was highlighted by an emphatic 21-point win over a Marquette team led by first team All-American Marcus Howard to win the Orlando Invitational, as well as dramatic road wins against Indiana, Illinois, Michigan State, and Minnesota, which memorably ended on Darryl Morsell's deep, buzzer beating three. Indicative of the program's reemergence on the national stage, for just the second time in program history ESPN's College Gameday returned to College Park in late February for a showdown against pre-season No. 1 Michigan State. Although the Terps lost the game (their only home loss of the season), and struggled mightily in a road loss three days later at Rutgers, they rebounded in their next and final home game against Michigan to capture their share of the conference championship and cut down the nets on Cowan Jr.'s senior night. Although Maryland fans will always wonder how far the team could have gone in March, the season will be remembered fondly for the championship and Cowan Jr.'s outstanding senior season, which saw him climb to No. 7 all time in program history in points, No. 5 in assists, and included several clutch performances in wins over Illinois and MSU. The season will also be remembered for the national emergence of Smith, who was selected to multiple All-American teams and picked 10th in the 2020 NBA Draft.\nThe program entered the 2020–2021 season with low expectations, primarily due to the departures of stalwarts Anthony Cowan Jr. and Jalen Smith, as well as three transfers in Ricky Lindo Jr., Serrell Smith Jr., and Joshua Tomaic. Jalen Smith's early entry into the 2020 NBA draft was a particular issue for the team, as there were no developed big men in line to take his minutes, a glaring weakness in the Big Ten Conference. Picked to finish 10th in the Big Ten Media Poll, Turgeon had to rely on a core of four returning players, Eric Ayala, Darryl Morsell, Aaron Wiggins, and Donta Scott. Turgeon shored up his roster by securing incoming transfers Jairus Hamilton and Galin Smith. The team finished 17–14 and 9–11 in the Big Ten, good enough for an 8th-place finish in the conference. The Terps won 5 of their last 7 conference games, rising from 4–9 to finish 9–11, and defeated Michigan State 68–57 in the first round of the Big Ten tournament. This late season rally was enough to earn a bid to the 2021 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as a 10 seed. Matched against the 7th-seeded 2020–21 UConn Huskies men's basketball team, the team won their first-round game 63–54. They advanced to face 2 seed Alabama, who made 16 three pointers in a 96–77 rout. Aaron Wiggins' performance was a bright spot, as he finished with 27 points. Eric Ayala and Aaron Wiggins received Honorable Mentions for the All-Big Ten teams, and Darryl Morsell won Defensive Player of the Year. On April 7, the University of Maryland announced Mark Turgeon's contract had been extended through the 2025–26 season. On December 3, 2021, Maryland and Turgeon agreed to mutually part ways. Danny Manning was named interim head coach. On March 21, 2022, Maryland hired Kevin Willard to be its tenth head coach in program history. Willard quickly went to the portal for the upcoming season picking up highly touted transfer prospect Jahmir Young from Charlotte. With Young leading the team, Maryland went 20-11, including winning the Hall of Fame Tip-Off tournament. Entering the tournament as an 8-seed, Maryland defeated 9-seeded West Virginia in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. In the second round of the tournament, they faced #1 overall seeded Alabama. They ultimately fell to the Tide 73-51, ending Kevin Willard's first season with an official record of 22-13.\nFacilities.\nXfinity Center (2002–present).\nThe Xfinity Center, which opened in the Fall of 2002, is the current home of the Maryland Terrapins men's and women's basketball programs. The building also features facilities for the wrestling and volleyball programs. The 17,950-seat state of the art on-campus facility is referred to as \"The House that Gary Built\" or \"Comcastle\", in reference to the arena's original name of Comcast Center, used from 2002 to July 2014. Xfinity Center provides one of the best home court advantages in the nation. This is largely due to the layout of the 4,000 seat student section which consists of the first ten rows surrounding the court in addition to the west wall of the arena, simply known as \"the Wall\", which was constructed at a 35-degree incline. Several former ACC opponents referred to the arena as the toughest place to play in the ACC.\nXfinity Center opened for Midnight Madness on October 11, 2002, and the first official men's game was a 64–49 victory over Miami University (Ohio) on November 24, 2002. On January 25, 2012, the court was renamed in honor of Gary Williams, the men's basketball coach who had retired the previous year.\nThe Xfinity Center welcomed 281,057 visitors over 16 games in its first season for an average of 17,566 which ranked 5th nationally in 2003. It was the first time Maryland had finished in the top 10 nationally in attendance since the 1976 season in which Maryland finished 4th with an average of 13,110 fans taking in games at Cole Field House. Every year from 2004 to 2010, Maryland finished between 4th and 9th nationally in attendance. \nAt the conclusion of the 2015–2016 season, Maryland is 205–42 (.830) all-time at Xfinity Center. Since 2003, Maryland has defeated 17 ranked opponents at Xfinity Center, including 11 top-ten teams, eight top-5 teams, and a top-ranked team (Duke University in 2003).\nCole Field House (1955–2002).\nPrior to 2002, the Terps spent 47 seasons—from 1955 to 2002—at Cole Field House. When college basketball was achieving its most explosive growth – from the late 1950s to the late 1970s – there was one college gymnasium on the East Coast that seated as many as 12,000 fans. Cole Field House epitomized the new big-time, main event status of college hoops, the sport of network TV and emerging legends. It was a building where history was routinely made, and fans could feel the echo of tradition and experience the electricity of top-flight college basketball. Additional seats were installed throughout the years to bring the final capacity to 14,596 (in 1993).\nCole Field House held its first East Regional finals in 1962, when NYU defeated St. John's in the final, 94–85. The Final Four was first held here in 1966 between Duke, Kentucky, Texas Western (now UTEP), and Utah. Texas Western (which started all black players) upset Kentucky's all-white team 72–65 in front of a crowd of 14,253. Future Maryland men's basketball coach Gary Williams, then a student, attended the game. Cole also hosted the Final Four in 1970 and is the nation's only on-campus arena to host multiple Final Fours.\nBud Millikan, the first Maryland coach at the venue, did not like its size saying at one point \"It's like playing on a neutral court\" with seats too far from the courts. In the late 1960s Lefty Driesell added a nearly 3,000 seats around the court raising the hometown decibel level. Upon adding additional seating to create a more intimate atmosphere with fans right along the court, Cole would develop into one of the best home court advantages in the country. Along with Notre Dame's Joyce Athletic Center, Cole is the site of the most upsets of top ranked opponents of any venue in college basketball. 7 No. 1 ranked teams have been upset inside Cole, with Maryland pulling the upset in 6 of those 7 games and the other being Texas Western's National Championship win over Kentucky in 1966.\nCole Field House was constructed in 1955 at a cost of $3.3 million. On December 2, 1955, Maryland played its first game at Cole beating rival Virginia 67–55. In 1972 the attendance record would be set as 15,287 fans packed into Cole and watched Maryland knock off North Carolina 79–77 in overtime. The final regular season game of the 2001 season at Cole saw Maryland defeat Virginia 102–67 for the most lopsided result in the rivalry's history. In 2002, in a game known amongst Maryland fans as the \"Oh, He Steal\" game, the 7th #1 ranked team would fall in Cole, as Maryland handed Duke an 87–73 defeat, taking over first place in the conference. Later that season Maryland would play its final game in Cole Field House, celebrating the regular season conference title with a 112–92 win over Virginia. Over 47 seasons, Maryland compiled an impressive 486–151 record at Cole Field House.\nRivalries.\nDuke.\nThe Duke–Maryland basketball rivalry is a dormant college basketball rivalry between the Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team of Duke University and Maryland Terrapins men's basketball team of the University of Maryland. The basketball series has been called one of the most intense intercollegiate rivalries of modern times by some. A Harris Interactive poll of Marylanders ranked it the third best in the state behind the Commanders–Cowboys and Ravens–Commanders rivalries in 2003 (before the Beltway Series of the Orioles and Nationals was possible). In 2014, Maryland left the ACC for the Big Ten and regular season games between Maryland and Duke are no longer scheduled regularly.\nVirginia.\nThanks to the proximity of these two long-time ACC members, and their status as Tobacco Road outsiders, Maryland and Virginia have a long-standing rivalry that spans many decades. Traditionally, these two schools would meet in the last game of the season, and they both acted as spoilers to the other as they sought conference championships and NCAA tournament appearances. This rivalry has been dormant in recent years however, thanks to Maryland's move to the Big Ten Conference, though they did match up in the 2014 ACC-Big Ten Challenge, a 76–65 win for the Cavaliers in College Park, Maryland. The Terrapins lead the all-time series 107–76.\nOn November 28, 2018, the rivalry was again renewed for the ACC-Big Ten Challenge, with Virginia winning by a score of 76–71.\nNorth Carolina.\nThe Maryland-North Carolina rivalry peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s when both programs were fixtures in the AP poll and legendary coaches Lefty Driesell of Maryland and Dean Smith of the Tar Heels patrolled the sidelines. Although the rivalry cooled towards the end of the Terps ACC era, it still produced some memorable moments. The schools reunited for an ACC-Big Ten Challenge matchup in 2015, with the Tar Heels winning the top ten battle 89–82. In 2017 the rivalry was renewed off the court, as part of the wider University of North Carolina academic-athletic scandal. Maryland president Wallace Loh stated that he believed UNC basketball should receive the Death Penalty as punishment. In response UNC coach Roy Williams called Loh a \"double idiot\".\nGeorgetown.\nMaryland and Georgetown have competed 49 times, the 10th most played opponent all-time for both Georgetown and Maryland. Maryland leads the all-time series 34–15. The two schools played each other every season from 1950 to 1980. The schools stopped playing in 1980 because of bad blood between head coaches John Thompson and Lefty Driesell, the two resumed play for one season in 1993 before taking a 22-game scheduled hiatus. The teams met twice in unplanned games during the gap, 2001 NCAA tournament for a sweet sixteen matchup, and again in 2008 for an Old Spice Classic early season matchup. In 2015 and 2016 the rivalry was renewed for the Gavitt Tipoff Games.\nMichigan State.\nMichigan State has emerged as one of Maryland's top rivals since the Terrapins moved to the Big Ten conference in 2014. The two schools have competed 16 times, including twice in the NCAA tournament in 2003 and 2010 while Maryland was still a member of the ACC. Michigan State won both NCAA tournament games by two points each, including a heartbreaking loss in 2010 on a last second three pointer. The 2010 loss struck deep as it ended the stellar 4-year career of Greivis Vásquez and denied coach Williams an open path to a third Final Four. Since Maryland joined the Big Ten, the two teams have produced memorable moments including Melo Trimble's buzzer beating three in his final home game in 2017 and Anthony Cowan Jr.'s three straight threes in the final minutes to close out a comeback win at MSU in 2020. MSU coach Tom Izzo earned the ire of Terp fans in 2015 after complaining that Trimble received too many favorable foul calls during his freshman year, a move that many believe led to officials not calling blatant fouls against Trimble in his sophomore and junior seasons. Adding to the Terps' tourney heartbreaks against Sparty, MSU won conference tournament semi-finals against Maryland in 2015 and 2016 by a combined seven points, the latter of which ended on a non-call when Trimble was apparently fouled driving to the basket down one point with two seconds left. Michigan State currently leads the all-time series 13–8 and the conference series 10–6.\nMichigan.\nA rivalry has begun to brew between the Maryland Terrapins and the Michigan Wolverines. Since Maryland joined the Big Ten, both teams have been contending for the conference championship, with Maryland coming out on top in 2020, and Michigan topping the table in 2021. The rivalry advanced during the 2020–2021 season. Star Michigan freshman Hunter Dickinson, who played high school basketball close to Maryland's campus, made comments that he felt \"disrespected\" by the Terps for having not recruited him and other DMV players harder while they were in high school. In his first game against the Terps, he scored 26 points, and frequently stared down the Maryland bench and Coach Turgeon. Michigan went to claim the regular season title. However, tensions boiled over in their match-up in the 2021 Big Ten Men's Basketball Championship, where head coach Juwan Howard was ejected after receiving a double technical after an altercation with Mark Turgeon and the Terrapin team. Howard claimed that Turgeon \"charged at him\" and made derogatory comments about him and the University of Michigan Basketball scandal, but Turgeon refuted those claims, saying \"I stood up for myself and my program and said 'Don't talk to me', and then [the situation] escalated. The all-time series is 8–13, leaning to Michigan.\nRecord against Big Ten opponents.\nTotals through March 31, 2024\nPost-season results.\nComplete NCAA tournament results.\nThe Terrapins have appeared in the NCAA tournament 30* (29) times.

He lost his main sponsor Masterdarts also. He also switched to be on the same circuit as his wife Anastasia Dobromyslova. His wife moved across to the PDC in December 2008, which in turn left Martin playing on a different circuit again. It was announced however during the 2009 Grand Slam of Darts that Martin would be competing in the PDC once more, starting in January 2010.\nHowever his season in the PDC was difficult as he suffered from loss of form and had injury problems, As a result, he did not get a tour card."

        "title": "Houston Cougars baseball",
        "text": "The Houston Cougars baseball team is the college baseball team of the University of Houston. Along with the university's other athletic teams, the baseball team is a member of the Big 12 Conference as a Division I team. They play their home games at Schroeder Park. In addition to 22 NCAA tournament appearances, the Cougars have made four Super Regional and two College World Series appearances. Houston has been led by head coach Todd Whitting since 2011.\nHistory.\nEarly years and Lovette Hill era.\nThe University of Houston's baseball program started in 1947. Head coach Ned Thompson was hired from Pasadena High School, and became the first baseball coach for 1947, backfield coach in football from 1946 to 1948 for the University of Houston. He also served as associate athletic director in charge of business finances from 1946 to 1976. Among the players for his 1947 baseball team was pitcher Bill Henry who had been a forward on Thompson's state high school championship basketball team the year prior. Following his 1947 efforts for Houston, Henry went on to become Houston's first player to play Major League Baseball, where he enjoyed an 18-year career.\nDuring the first few years of the baseball team's existence, head coaches came and went, and after the third season, the team had already been through three. Houston's fourth head baseball coach, Lovette Hill broke this trend when taking over for the 1950 season. A year after Hill became coach, the Houston Cougars appeared in their first NCAA Regional. The 1953 season was one of the team's most historic and winningest years as they made their first College World Series appearance. Continuing with Hill, the Cougars appeared in several more NCAA Regionals throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Appearing in the finals of the 1967 College World Series against the Arizona State Sun Devils, the Cougars finished runner-up and with a #2 national ranking. The team also began playing their home games at nearby Buffalo Stadium, before moving into an on-campus facility. Also during this time, the University of Houston discontinued their stint as being independent from any college athletic conference, and joined the now defunct Southwest Conference in 1973.\nWalton era.\nAfter a 25-year tenure with the Cougars, Lovette Hill retired, and Rolan Walton took over as head coach. Walton had previously played for the Cougars in the early years under Hill. He later played as a shortstop for the Victoria Rosebuds, a Texas League team, before leaving in 1954. During Walton's time as coach, the Cougars appeared in two more NCAA Regionals throughout the 1980s.\nStockton era.\nIn 1987, the University of Houston hired Bragg Stockton as head coach, and appeared in another NCAA Regional the same year. Before Stockton retired after the 1994 season, the Cougars made one more appearance. Playing under Stockton were several standout players including Rayner Noble. After a brief stint of playing in Minor League Baseball, Noble returned to the University of Houston as an assistant coach under Stockton. In 1994, following Bragg Stockton's retirement, Rayner Noble was named head coach of the Cougars. Stockton however, was not completely done with the team, and returned for the 2002 season as a volunteer coach. Working with Noble for only a year, Stockton died.\nNoble era.\nAfter becoming head coach of the Cougars in 1994, Rayner Noble launched the Cougars to more NCAA Regional appearances than any other coach in the team's history. In addition to eight of such appearances, the Cougars have appeared in three NCAA Super Regionals. In 1995, the Cougars baseball team received a newly constructed Cougar Field that seated 5,000. The following year was the last for the Southwest Conference, and in 1997 the Cougars joined Conference USA. In 2004, the Cougars played San Diego State at Petco Park in front of 40,106, the largest college baseball crowd to date.\nIn 2006, pitcher Brad Lincoln won the Dick Howser Trophy. Lincoln was the first to receive this award in the program's history, and in Conference USA. He also received the Brooks Wallace Award that year among other honors.\nIn Conference USA, the Cougars appeared in every Conference USA baseball tournament, and held the second most number of tournament titles (behind Tulane).\nDespite becoming the program's winningest coach, Noble's 2009 and 2010 records were back-to-back losing seasons, which Houston had not seen since 1974 and 1975.\nWhitting and modern era.\nIn 2010, it was announced that Rayner Noble would not return as Houston's head coach. Former assistant coach and player for Houston Todd Whitting was announced as his replacement. Whitting had served in various positions with TCU, ultimately serving as associate head coach before returning to his alma mater.\nIn the 2013 season after rebuilding the team for two years, Whitting led the Houston Cougar Baseball team to its best start in 24 seasons. In March 2013, for the first time in seven years, with Whitting at the helm, the Cougars were ranked in the top twenty by Baseball America.\nHouston's Cougar Field (now Schroeder Park) received substantial renovations at the end of the 2013 calendar year thanks to major donations from alumni and former players. FieldTurf was installed to replace the natural grass and bullpens were upgraded, giving the stadium a nice makeover.\nIn 2014 season, the Houston Cougars joined the American Athletic Conference for its inaugural season. Riding the momentum of the 2013 season, the Cougars continued their success into 2014 and won the inaugural AAC conference tournament. The Cougars finished the 2014 regular season with an impressive 44–15 record and ranking as high as number 9 nationally. This was also the first season since 1993 that the Cougars swept baseball powerhouse Rice and claimed the Silver Glove Series.\nHead coaches.\nNotes: Through 2023 season. \nRivalries.\nEach year, Houston competes in the Silver Glove series against the Rice Owls. They also play against the Sam Houston State Bearkats in what has been dubbed the Don Sanders Cup.\nIndividual awards.\nNational Player award winners.\nABCA/Rawlings National Player of the Year\nBrooks Wallace Award\nDick Howser Trophy\nConference Player of the Year.\n† co-Player of the Year\nConference Pitcher of the Year.\n† co-Pitcher of the Year\nIndividual Honors.\nNational College Baseball Hall of Fame inductees.\nThe following Houston players and coaches have been enshrined in the National College Baseball Hall of Fame. \nRetired numbers.\nThe Cougars have retired three numbers."

There, Sampras had a stomach bug and vomited during the fifth set, prompting a warning from the referee for delaying the match. He eventually won the fifth set in a tiebreak, 7–6(9–7).\nIn the draw for the tournament, there were accusations of American favoritism as world No. 3 Michael Chang, world No. 8 Andre Agassi, and world No. 9 Jim Courier (all Americans) were seeded above their ATP ranking at numbers 2, 6, and 8 respectively. Other top players were also seeded above their world ranking, including world No. 6 Goran Ivanišević (seeded fourth) and world No. 7 Richard Krajicek (seeded fifth). Conversely, other players were seeded below their world ranking, including world No. 2 Thomas Muster (seeded third), world No. 5 Boris Becker (seeded sixth), and world No. 4 Yevgeny Kafelnikov (seeded seventh). Becker withdrew from the tournament with an injury, and Kafelnikov withdrew from the tournament in protest of the seeding.\nThis tournament marked the last major singles appearance of six-time major singles champion Stefan Edberg; he lost to Ivanišević in the quarterfinals.\nSeeds.\nThe seeded players are listed below.

        "title": "Nebraska Cornhuskers baseball",
        "text": "The Nebraska Cornhuskers baseball team competes as part of NCAA Division I, representing the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in the Big Ten Conference. Nebraska plays its home games at Hawks Field at Haymarket Park, built in 2001 to replace the aging Buck Beltzer Stadium. The program began intercollegiate play in 1889 and has been coached by Will Bolt since 2020.\nNebraska's baseball program was disjointed in its first decades, frequently disbanding for years at a time. The hiring of Tony Sharpe in 1947 brought stability to the program, but success was limited. Sharpe and his successor John Sanders combined to lead NU for fifty-one seasons, making just three NCAA tournament appearances between them. Nebraska hired Dave Van Horn in 1998 and he quickly turned the Huskers into a national power, making the program's first two College World Series appearances in 2001 and 2002. Mike Anderson took over for Van Horn and in 2005 led NU to its most successful season ever, including another College World Series trip. Anderson could not sustain this, however; since his departure in 2011 Nebraska has experienced modest success under head coaches Darin Erstad and Will Bolt.\nNebraska has been to the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship seventeen times and advanced to three College World Series. The Cornhuskers have won eight regular season conference championships and four conference tournament championships. Sixteen Huskers have been named First-Team All-Americans and Alex Gordon won the 2005 Golden Spikes Award as the best amateur baseball player in the country.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nBaseball was established as the University of Nebraska–Lincoln's first organized sport in 1883. Players were divided amongst three nine-player teams based on skill level and participated in scrimmages across campus. The first of these scrimmages was a 31–23 victory for the varsity team over the junior varsity team that had to be cut short because the only available bat broke. This continued for several years until the Nebraska \"Old Gold Knights\" (the school's nickname until 1893) played their first intercollegiate baseball game in 1889, a 23–6 victory over Doane College (now Doane University). The program was loosely organized throughout its first decades; most of its early head coaches, including College Football Hall of Famer Edward N. Robinson, led the team for only a single year. In many seasons Nebraska did not play a single intercollegiate game.\nFollowing a decade of relative stability, Nebraska's baseball program was discontinued after the 1910 season at the request of the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association (later the Big Eight Conference), despite Nebraska's baseball team competing as an independent. The MVIAA claimed that several of Nebraska's players had played for, and received payment from, minor league teams over the summer, violating the amateur status required of college athletes. After a year without a baseball team of any sort, the program was briefly revived in 1912, playing three games, before shuttering entirely. The ending of World War I and subsequent influx of male students, along with the University of Nebraska's departure from the MVIAA, meant the school's baseball team could be revived under the guidance of Paul J. Schissler in 1919. Schissler led NU's baseball and basketball programs until his departure for Lombard College in 1921; he later served as head coach of the National Football League's Chicago Cardinals and Brooklyn Dodgers and is credited with helping establish the Pro Bowl.\nAfter a second hiatus, Nebraska's baseball program was again revived in 1929 under the guidance of state native John Rhodes. By this time the University of Nebraska had re-joined the MVIAA (which had changed its name to the Big Six Conference); NU won the Bix Six championship in its first-ever season of conference competition. Rhodes left for Wyoming in 1930 and Nebraska struggled through the next decade, never finishing higher than third in the Big Six.\nSharpe and Sanders stability.\nIn 1947, following a three-year stoppage for World War II, NU hired Tony Sharpe to lead its baseball program. Sharpe quickly turned the Huskers into a conference contender, winning the Big Seven (the Big Six added Colorado in 1947) in 1948 and 1950. In both of these seasons Nebraska appeared in the NCAA District playoffs, the predecessor of the NCAA Super Regionals as they exist today. Bob Cerv became Nebraska's first baseball All-American in 1950; Cerv also played basketball and was the school's first four-year varsity letterwinner in multiple sports. Richard Geier threw the first perfect game in Nebraska baseball history on April 20, 1954. Geier struck out ten on his way to retiring twenty-seven consecutive batters in a 1–0 Cornhuskers victory over Kansas.\nDespite the early successes, Sharpe's program stagnated and did not win another conference title for the rest of his thirty-one year tenure as head coach. He earned his 300th victory at Nebraska on March 28, 1972, a 4–3 victory over Houston in the first game of a doubleheader; Houston head coach Lovette Hill earned his 300th victory in the second game, also 4–3. Sharpe retired in 1977 following a 29–13 season that was the program's best in decades.\nJohn Sanders was named Sharpe's replacement after serving for two seasons as an assistant coach. Athletic director Bob Devaney credited Sanders for revitalizing Sharpe's program, which finished 1977 with a school-record twenty-nine wins. Sanders's tenure began in the same way Sharpe's did; the Cornhuskers twice appeared in the NCAA tournament and won the Big Eight Conference in 1980. NU finished the 1980 season ranked fourteenth in the inaugural year of the Baseball America weekly poll. In Nebraska's May 3, 1980 victory over Kansas, pitcher Cliff Faust retired all twenty-one Jayhawks batters who came to the plate, the second perfect game in school history. Faust allowed only five balls hit out of the infield, including a sinking line drive that became the final out of the game when left fielder Joe Scherger made a diving catch.\nSanders was very well-liked by players and supporters, and was sometimes known as \"Big Red\" due to his imposing stature and red hair. Following his death in 2022, Sanders was praised by former player Jeff Rhein, an African-American, for his support following a 1991 incident in which several Huskers were the target of racial slurs. Under Sanders, Darin Erstad became the No. 1 selection in the 1995 MLB Draft.\nDespite his popularity and passion for baseball, Sanders's program stalled after a promising start in the same way his predecessor Sharpe's did. After winning the Big Eight in 1980, Nebraska finished nationally ranked three more times under Sanders and appeared in the 1985 NCAA tournament, but never won another conference championship. Sanders was fired following Nebraska's first season in the Big 12 Conference, departing the school with a 767–453–1 record across twenty years. He had only two losing seasons, including his final one. Sanders's 767 wins stood as a school record for any sport until softball coach Rhonda Revelle won her 768th game in 2013.\nRise to national prominence.\nNorthwestern State head coach Dave Van Horn was hired to replace Sanders just thirty-five days before the 1998 season. In his second season, the Cornhuskers won the program's first conference tournament title, and first championship of any kind since 1950. NU reached the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1985, finishing the season 42–18. On March 16 of the 1999 season, Nebraska defeated Chicago State 50–3, setting NCAA records for runs scored (50), margin of victory (47), and runs batted in (48). Nebraska scored at least four runs in every inning until the game was called following the top of the seventh due to a twelve-run mercy rule. Eight Huskers accounted for nine home runs in the game; Ken Harvey scored a Big 12-record seven runs and Craig Moore became the third NU player to drive in ten runs in a game. Eleven Huskers had at least two hits and seven had at least three hits.\nIn 2000, led by Big 12 Player of the Year Shane Komine, Nebraska earned the top seed in an NCAA Regional (though it was played in Minneapolis, Minnesota) and won three consecutive games to advance to an NCAA Super Regional for the first time. NU defeated Stanford 7–3 in the first game of the series, but lost the next two. Nebraska began the following season ranked in the national top ten for the first time in school history. A thirteen-game win streak propelled NU to a No. 4 ranking in the Baseball America weekly poll, its highest ever, and the program's first regular-season conference title since 1950. Nebraska went 4–0 in the Big 12 Tournament to win it for the third consecutive year, becoming the first team in the Big 12's short history to win the regular-season and tournament title in the same season. The Cornhuskers earned the No. 8 overall seed in the NCAA tournament and hosted a regional for the first time in school history, defeating Northern Iowa and Rutgers. They advanced to a super regional and swept Rice in the final games played at Buck Beltzer Stadium. In the school's first College World Series appearance, Nebraska lost consecutive one-run games to top-ranked Cal State Fullerton and Tulane. NU finished 50–16, their second straight fifty-win season; Komine won his second Big 12 Pitcher of the Year award and Van Horn was named Baseball America's National Coach of the Year.\nThe University of Nebraska–Lincoln opened Hawks Field at Haymarket Park in 2002, a multi-use facility including stadiums for baseball and softball. The Cornhuskers swept seven teams during the season, including an eleven-game win streak that ended with a loss to Texas in the Big 12 Tournament championship game. Dave Van Horn won his 200th game at Nebraska on May 10 and Jed Morris became the first catcher in school history to earn All-America honors. Nebraska advanced through a regional for the third straight year before hosting Richmond in an NCAA Super Regional. NU defeated the Spiders in three games to advance to Omaha for the second straight season, where they lost to Clemson and South Carolina in the College World Series. After the 2002 season, Van Horn accepted the head coaching position at Arkansas, his alma mater. He departed Nebraska with a record of 214–92 and three straight Big 12 Tournament championships in his five-year tenure.\nLongtime assistant coach Mike Anderson was named head coach after Van Horn's departure. Nebraska lost just one conference series in Anderson's first season, going 20–7 and winning the Big 12 again. The Cornhuskers hosted a regional but were eliminated by Southwestern Missouri State, ending the season 47–18. Alex Gordon earned Collegiate Baseball Freshman All-America honors and was named Big 12 Freshman of the Year. In 2004, NU fell to eighth in the Big 12 and failed to win forty games for the first time since 1998, missing the NCAA tournament entirely.\nAnderson's third season as head coach became the most successful in program history. Nebraska started the season with a five-game sweep of Hawaii-Hilo and followed by winning twenty of twenty-three games. NU lost just one conference series and split the Big 12 regular season championship with Baylor. After dropping the first game of the Big 12 Tournament, Nebraska won five games in four days, including a 1–0 win over Baylor in the championship game, to win the tournament for the fourth time in six years. The Huskers were named the national No. 3 seed and swept through the regional and super regional rounds, defeating Miami (FL) to advance to the College World Series for the third time in five years. The Cornhuskers defeated Arizona State 5–3 for the first College World Series win in program history, but lost the next two games and were eliminated. Nebraska's fifty-seven wins, including thirty-three at home, were the most in the country and a school record. Led by Johnny Dorn and Big 12 Newcomer of the Year Joba Chamberlain, NU ranked second nationally in ERA, and Alex Gordon won the Golden Spikes Award as the top amateur baseball player in the country.\nDecline and move to the Big Ten.\nNebraska spent much of the 2006 season in the top five nationally, reaching as high as No. 2, but lost eleven of its last seventeen games and failed to advance out of its regional. The following season followed a similar trajectory; NU began the season ranked ninth nationally, but finished just fourth in the Big 12 and were eliminated a game short of reaching a super regional. NU lost eight pitchers to the MLB draft prior to 2008, and despite a fourteen-game win streak which helped the young team reach a No. 5 national ranking, the Huskers again lost in a home regional. Nebraska lost several key players, including star pitcher Johnny Dorn, following the 2008 season, and the program's tenth-place Big 12 finish in 2009 was its worst since 1997. Anderson was fired in 2011 after missing the postseason entirely in each of his last three seasons, departing with a 337–196–2 record across nine seasons. \nBefore Nebraska began its first season in the Big Ten in 2012, the school hired former Husker outfielder and Major League Baseball All-Star Darin Erstad as head coach. Ted Silva was hired as Erstad's pitching coach and former Huskers Will Bolt and Jeff Christy were named assistants. Nebraska earned the No. 4 seed in the Big Ten Tournament in Erstad's first season, the program's first postseason appearance of any kind since 2008.\nNebraska lost its first seven games of the 2013 season, its worst start since 1976. The team improved significantly as conference play began, and on April 16 three NU pitchers combined to no-hit twelfth-ranked Arkansas, led by former Huskers head coach Dave Van Horn. Despite a second-place Big Ten finish and the No. 31 RPI rank in the country, normally strong enough to qualify for the NCAA tournament, NU's sub-.500 record disqualified them from consideration. NU again finished second in the Big Ten in 2014, returning to the NCAA tournament for the first time in six years. After three conference runner-up finishes under Erstad, Nebraska won its first Big Ten regular-season championship in 2017. The Cornhuskers lost to Maryland in the second round of the conference tournament; their quick elimination from the NCAA tournament dropped Erstad's record as a head coach in NCAA Regionals to 0–6. Nebraska won its first NCAA tournament game under Erstad in 2019, but a blown eighth-inning lead against Oklahoma State and a blowout loss to Connecticut again eliminated the Huskers. Erstad resigned as head coach following the 2019 season, citing his desire to spend time with his family.\nOn June 14, 2019, Will Bolt was named Nebraska baseball's twenty-sixth head coach. After his first season was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Bolt guided the Huskers to a 34–14 record in 2021, winning the Big Ten regular-season championship and winning two games in the NCAA tournament before being eliminated by top-seeded Arkansas.\nCoaches.\nCoaching history.\nIn its early years, Nebraska's program cycled through head coaches, most of whom led the program for a single year. The Cornhuskers competed as an independent until 1929, when John Rhodes led the team to the Big Six championship. W. W. Knight, hired forty-four years after the program's first season of competition, was Nebraska's first head coach to hold the position for more than three years.\nAfter decades of heavy coaching turnover, the hire of Tony Sharpe in 1947 brought stability to the program for the first time; Sharpe and his successor John Sanders led Nebraska for a combined fifty-one years. However, this consistency did not translate to on-field success, as the two coaches combined for just three NCAA tournament appearances. NU's first national success arrived with the hire of Dave Van Horn in 1998, who took the program to its first College World Series appearances in 2001 and 2002. When Van Horn resigned to return to his alma mater Arkansas after the 2002 season, assistant Mike Anderson succeeded him and led NU to a program-record fifty-seven wins and another College World Series appearance in 2005.\nNebraska has been coached by Will Bolt since 2020.\nFacilities.\nBuck Beltzer Stadium.\nThe Cornhuskers played at Buck Beltzer Stadium (originally The Nebraska Diamond) from the 1940s until 2001. It was named after Oren \"Buck\" Beltzer, a standout football and baseball player in the early 1900s. The stadium was located northeast of Memorial Stadium and adjacent to Interstate 180. The stadium's 1,500-seat capacity was expanded with additional bleacher sections shipped in for NCAA tournament games. The five NCAA tournament games hosted at Buck Beltzer Stadium produced its five largest-ever crowds. Nebraska's final game at the stadium was a 9–6 win over Rice to send the program to its first College World Series.\nBy the time of its closing, Buck Beltzer Stadium was considered out-of-date and lacked many features common among similar venues. The stadium did not have a warning track or a permanent fence because Nebraska's football team used the outfield to practice for games to be played on grass. These practices meant the outfield was often covered in divots, making ground balls difficult for outfielders to properly field (termed \"the bounce of the Buck\" or \"the Buck bounce\"). Despite its shortcomings, Buck Beltzer Stadium was generally well-liked by Nebraska's players and supporters due to its unique features and intimate environment. Nebraska's all-time record at Buck Beltzer Stadium was 527–137.\nHawks Field at Haymarket Park.\nThe University of Nebraska–Lincoln announced plans to construct a new baseball and softball stadium complex on July 30, 1999. Haymarket Park broke ground on April 12, 2000, just off U.S. Route 6 and Charleston Street west of downtown Lincoln. The baseball portion of the facility was oriented such that downtown Lincoln, and especially Memorial Stadium, can be clearly viewed over the outfield walls. Nebraska played its first game at Hawks Field on March 4, 2002, a 23–1 victory over Nebraska–Kearney.\nHawks Field is named for Myrna Hawks, the wife of prominent Omaha businessman Howard Hawks; the couple were significant donors to the construction of the complex. Hawks Field has a listed capacity of 8,486; NU ranked fourteenth nationally in total attendance in 2022 and regularly leads the Big Ten Conference in attendance. The highest recorded attendance at Hawks Field was on April 14, 2006, when an overflow crowd of 8,757 watched Nebraska defeat Texas A&amp;M 4–3. Nebraska's all-time record at Hawks Field is 388–148–1.\nAlex Gordon Training Complex\nNebraska constructed the $4.75 million Alex Gordon Training Complex in 2011, adjacent to Bowlin Stadium and just northeast of Hawks Field. The facility was named for former NU All-American and Major League Baseball All-Star Alex Gordon, who donated one million dollars to the project.\nRivalries.\nNebraska and Creighton have competed in an in-state rivalry since their first meeting in 1902, a 9–3 Nebraska win. The Huskers and Bluejays play a non-consecutive series each year, switching venues for each game. Creighton originally played home games at the Creighton Sports Complex and occasionally Rosenblatt Stadium before moving to TD Ameritrade Park (now Charles Schwab Field) in 2011. The Huskers defeated the Bluejays 2–1 in the first game between the teams at TD Ameritrade Park on April 19, 2011. Nebraska leads the series 87–57–2. However, Creighton has won the last 10 out of 12 matchups dating back to 2017. \nNebraska also plays a non-consecutive series against Omaha each year. Nebraska leads the series 61–12.\nMLB players.\nForty former Huskers have played at least one Major League Baseball game."

        "title": "Intercollegiate Rowing Association",
        "text": "The Intercollegiate Rowing Association (IRA) governs intercollegiate rowing between varsity men's heavyweight, men's lightweight, and women's lightweight rowing programs across the United States, while the NCAA fulfills this role for women's open weight rowing. It is the direct successor to the Rowing Association of American Colleges, the first collegiate athletic organization in the United States, which operated from 1870–1894.\nThe IRA was founded by Cornell, Columbia, and Penn in 1894 and its first annual regatta was hosted on June 24, 1895. Today Navy and Syracuse are also part of the association. Each year these five schools choose whom to invite to the IRA National Championship Regatta and are responsible for its organization.\nThe IRA runs the IRA National Championship Regatta, which since 1895 has been considered to be the United States collegiate national championship of men's rowing. This regatta today includes both men's and women's (lightweight) events for 8- and 4-oared sweep boats with coxswains and a women's lightweight double scull (two-oars for each rower) event.\nThe IRA National Championship is the oldest college rowing championship in the United States.\nHistory.\nColumbia, Cornell and Pennsylvania were the organizing stewards of the Poughkeepsie Regatta, the IRA Championship until 1949. The first edition was held on the Hudson River at Poughkeepsie, New York, on June 24, 1895.\nThe format through 1967 with the exception of 1964 was to line all the entries in the race onto stake-boats and fire a shotgun for the start. In the last race of this format in 1967 on Onondaga Lake, in Syracuse, New York, 16 varsity crews waited for the gun to begin their three-mile race—winner take all.\nThe format was changed in the Olympic year, 1968, to heats and finals over a 2,000-meter, six-lane course. This -rep-final, six-lane, 2,000 meter format continues today. \nSince the 1920s, when the West Coast crews—notably California and Washington—began to attend and regularly win, the Intercollegiate Rowing Association's championship (known as the IRA) has been considered the national championship for collegiate rowing. Two important crews, Harvard and Yale, however, did not participate in the heavyweight divisions of the event for a lengthy period. (After losing to Cornell in 1897, Harvard and Yale chose to avoid the IRA, so as not to diminish the Harvard–Yale Regatta. The IRA championship was held each year preceding that regatta, which Harvard and Yale considered more important to their schools and alumni than the IRA event. It soon became part of each school's tradition not to participate.) Beginning in 1973, Washington decided to skip the IRA because a change in schedule conflicted with its finals. Washington, however, returned to the regatta in 1995. \nFrom 1982 to 1996, another event, the Cincinnati Regatta (which renamed itself the National Collegiate Rowing Championship), was held in Cincinnati with funding from a benefactor. It was viewed by some crews as an additional, quasi-championship, as the field included Harvard and Yale, as well as medalists from the IRA regatta, Pac-10 and Eastern Sprints. In 2003, after an absence of over one hundred years, Harvard and Yale decided to participate in the IRA championship. \nBefore 2006, some competitive club rowing programs, which receive little or no funding from their university athletic departments, were invited to the IRA Championship. In 2006, Rutgers University cut funding from its men's rowing program, reducing it to \"club\" status. Part of Rutger's justification for cutting rowing was that clubs could compete equally with funded programs at the IRA Championships. To avoid other members from losing funding, the IRA excluded clubs from competing at its championship beginning in 2007, leading to the creation of the American Collegiate Rowing Association for clubs. \nThe IRA regatta was cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nChampions.\nVarsity Heavyweight Eights.\nMen\n\" * Not held in 1933 due to the Depression. However, the first college 2000-meter national championship ever held was conducted by local businessmen in Long Beach, California, as a substitute. Washington raced both Harvard and Yale for the first time at this event and defeated Yale by eight lengths to win the championship. Washington counts this victory among its string of Men’s National Varsity Eight Championships.\"\n† \"Navy was disqualified from the IRA Regatta for use of an ineligible coxswain. Trophies won by Navy were forfeited and not awarded. Cornell finished second.\"\nNumber of Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championships: Men's Varsity Heavyweight Eights.\n1 Cornell University (26 championships)\n2 University of Washington (19 championships)\n3 University of California - Berkeley (19 championships)\n4 US Naval Academy (12 championships)\n5 University of Pennsylvania (12 championships)\n6 University of Wisconsin - Madison (12 championships)\n7 Brown University (7 championships)\n8 Syracuse University (6 championships)\n9 Columbia University (4 championships)\n10 Princeton University (3 championships)\n10 Harvard University (3 championships)\n10 Yale University (3 championships)\n13 Northeastern University (2 championships)\n14 Dartmouth College (1 championship)\nTen Eyck Trophy.\nThe Ten Eyck Trophy is awarded to the school amassing the most overall points in a system based on the finishing places of three heavyweight eights crews. From 1952 through 1973, the winning team was the one with the most points in the varsity, junior varsity and freshman eights. Starting in 1974, all races counted in the scoring under a system adopted by the coaches of the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges. More recently, the scoring system was revised to include only three of the four possible eights from each school in the points standings."

        "text": "Steve Collins (born August 2, 1970 in Ennis, Texas) is a former American football quarterback who played for the Oklahoma Sooners from 1988 to 1992.\nCollins attended Ennis High School and was the quarterback of the school's football team. He was recruited by various colleges, and decided to attend Oklahoma; during collegiate recruiting, scouts considered him one of the best option quarterbacks in the state.\nCollins redshirted his freshman year at Oklahoma in 1988. After starting quarterback Charles Thompson's arrest, the starting job was said to be between Collins, unrelated fellow freshman Tink Collins, and sophomore Chris Melson, none of whom had played a college football game yet. After summer drills were completed, Collins was granted the starting job for the Sooners, becoming the first freshman in school history to start the season opener at quarterback. Collins began the season as starting quarterback in 1989, but he broke the pinky on his right hand on the first play of the Sooners' 33-7 victory over Baylor on September 9, 1989. In early November, he returned to the lineup and ran for 147 yards and two touchdowns, and passed for 119 yards and a touchdown in a 52-14 win over Missouri.\nAs a redshirt sophomore in 1990, Collins was Oklahoma's starting quarterback for the first six games of the season. He lost the starting job for the last half of the 1990 season to Cale Gundy. He remained Gundy's backup for most of the 1991 season. As a senior in 1992, Collins began the year as the Sooners' backup quarterback, but Collins became the team's starting quarterback after Gundy suffered a concussion in the seventh game of the season. During the 1992 season, there was dissension among the players over the decision of Coach Gary Gibbs to name Gundy as the starting quarterback over Collins."

        "text": "The 1996 LSU Tigers baseball team won the NCAA national championship in one of the most memorable College World Series games in history.\nThe Tigers, coached by Skip Bertman, had already established themselves as a premier college baseball program, having won two previous national championships in 1991 and 1993. The 1996 version built on this reputation by compiling a 52–15 record, including going 20–10 in the Southeastern Conference, winning the SEC championship as well.\nRegular season.\nThe Tigers regular season record was 43–13 with notable losses coming against conference rivals Alabama and a 3-game sweep at the hands of Florida.\nSEC tournament.\nLSU defeated Tennessee in the first game of the 1996 SEC baseball tournament but then lost to Florida (their fourth loss to them in as many games) and Kentucky and were eliminated.\nNCAA Tournament Regional.\nLSU cruised through the \"regional\" round (hosted by LSU at Alex Box Stadium) of the NCAA Tournament defeating Austin Peay 9-3, UNLV 7-6, UNO 17–4 and Georgia Tech 29-13.\nCollege World Series.\nThe Tigers opened the College World Series by defeating Wichita State 9-8, the same team they beat in the championship games of 1991 and 1993. LSU then moved on to play conference rival Florida (who had beaten the Tigers in all four games played earlier in the season). LSU won 9-4. Florida then came back through the losers bracket to face LSU again. The Tigers won the second game 2–1 to move onto the championship game.\nThe championship game featured a match-up of two college baseball powers in LSU and Miami (Florida). Both teams had previously won 2 national championships (Miami: 1982 &amp; 1985) and were vying for their third. Miami featured future major leaguers Alex Cora and Pat Burrell, who helped the Hurricanes to establish a 7–3 lead in the game. However, the Tigers would fight back to tie the game. Cora then reclaimed the lead for Miami with an RBIs single and the Hurricanes then led 8–7 heading into the 9th inning.\nWith 2 outs and a runner on third base LSU only needed a base hit or a wild pitch to tie the game. An unlikely hero emerged from the LSU dugout in Warren Morris, who had been hurt most of the year. He stepped to the plate and faced pitcher Robbie Morrison. Morris swung on Morrison's first pitch and lined the ball just inches over the right field fence for a 2 out, game winning walk off home run. This was his first home run of the season.\nAftermath.\nMorris' home run would later win the 1997 Showstopper of the Year ESPY Award.\nThe Tigers won their third national championship and would follow it up with four more in 1997, 2000, 2009, and 2023. Miami would recover and go on to win two more national championships as well in 1999 and 2001."

        "title": "2007 Major League Baseball season",
        "text": "The 2007 Major League Baseball season began on April 1 with a rematch of the 2006 National League Championship Series; the St. Louis Cardinals and New York Mets played the first game of the season at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri, which was won by the Mets, 6–1. The regular season concluded with seven teams entering the postseason who had failed to reach the 2006 playoffs including all National League teams, with only the New York Yankees returning; a dramatic one-game playoff between the Colorado Rockies and San Diego Padres; and the largest September collapse for a leading team in baseball history, with the Mets squandering a 7-game lead with 17 to play, losing on the final day of the regular season, and the Philadelphia Phillies capturing the National League East for the first time since 1993. The season ended on October 28, with the Boston Red Sox sweeping the World Series over the Rockies, four games to zero.\nA special exhibition game known as the \"Civil Rights Game\" was played on March 31 in AutoZone Park in Memphis, Tennessee, between the Cardinals and the Cleveland Indians to celebrate the history of civil rights in the United States. The 2007 season commemorates the 60th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's entry into the game, breaking the color barrier.\nFor the fourth consecutive season, MLB regular season attendance increased by comparison with the previous year. In 2007, an all-time attendance record of 79,502,524 (32,785 per game) was set.\nPostseason.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket/&gt;\n&lt;section end=Bracket/&gt;\nNote: Two teams in the same division could not meet in the division series.\nAccomplishments.\nBarry Bonds surpasses Hank Aaron.\nBarry Bonds, left fielder for the San Francisco Giants, surpassed Hank Aaron as the all-time home run leader in Major League Baseball history with his 756th career home run off Mike Bacsik of the Washington Nationals in the fifth inning of their game August 7 at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco, California. The 3–2 pitch with one out and nobody on base was hit at 8:51 PM US PDT and according to hittrackeronline.com was estimated to have gone 422 feet. However, the Nationals came back and won the game, 8–6. Through his final home game (and last game of the season), on September 26, Bonds has hit 762 home runs.\nThe baseball that was hit for the record was caught by Mets fan Matt Murphy, who put the ball up for auction online. The winning bidder was fashion designer Marc Ecko, who purchased the baseball for $752,467 (US) and let fans decide what to do with it in an internet poll. Options included donating the ball to the Baseball Hall of Fame as-is, donating it marked with an asterisk (reflecting the widely held belief that Bonds used performance-enhancing drugs to break the record), or sending the baseball into space. The vote decided that an asterisk would be added, and the ball donated to Cooperstown. In an interview that aired on MSNBC's \"Countdown with Keith Olbermann\" on November 1 and 2, Bonds stated to interviewer Jim Gray that if the ball were to be put on display with the asterisk, he would boycott his own Hall of Fame induction if he were elected.\nOther accomplishments.\nNo-hitters.\nThree no-hitters were pitched during the 2007 regular season. This is the most in a single season since the three pitched in 2001. All three no-hitters in 2007 were in the American League, which is the most in a single league since the record-tying 1991 season when the two leagues combined for seven no-hitters (4 AL, 3 NL).\nAll-Star game.\nOn July 10, 2007, at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco, the American League defeated the National League by a score of 5–4. The victory was the tenth consecutive (excluding the 2002 tie) for the AL, and their eleven-game unbeaten streak matches only the NL's streak from 1972 to 1982 in All-Star history.\nCeremonial games.\nJackie Robinson.\nOn April 15, Major League Baseball celebrated the sixtieth anniversary of the debut of Jackie Robinson at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, breaking the color barrier. Cincinnati Reds outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. asked Robinson's widow, Rachel, and commissioner Bud Selig for permission to wear Robinson's number 42 in honor of him. He was granted permission, and Selig later said that any player who wanted to wear number 42 on his jersey could. The jersey was worn without the players' name on the back, as was the case when Robinson played with the Brooklyn Dodgers. All jerseys that were worn were auctioned off with all the proceeds donated to the Jackie Robinson Foundation, an organization which awards scholarships to African-American high school graduates to further themselves in colleges academically.\nThe Dodgers, Cardinals, and Brewers elected to have the entire team wear number 42 in his honor. The Pittsburgh Pirates, Phillies, and Astros were also scheduled to share that honor, but their games were postponed due to rain. The Phillies and Astros honored Robinson on April 23 when they made up their postponed game as originally planned, while the Pirates waited until April 27 to honor Robinson by wearing #42 as a team against the Reds.\nLarry Doby.\nOn August 10, the Cleveland Indians paid tribute to Larry Doby, the first African-American to play in the American League at Jacobs Field in Cleveland, Ohio. Every player on the Indians wore number 14, the number Doby wore during his career with the Indians.\nFarewells.\nThe Nationals played their final game at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium on September 23, beating the Phillies 5–3. The team's new home, Nationals Park, formally opened on March 30, 2008.\nThe Tampa Bay franchise played its last season as the Devil Rays. In 2008, the name was shortened to Tampa Bay Rays.\nJosh Hancock.\nJosh Hancock, a relief pitcher with the St. Louis Cardinals, died on April 29 in a car accident outside St. Louis, Missouri. The 29-year-old pitcher was killed within a couple of minutes after impact when the SUV he was driving crashed into a towing vehicle on Interstate 64. This marks the second time in five years that a Cardinals pitcher lost his life before a game, the other being Darryl Kile, who died suddenly on June 22, 2002. The team postponed their game scheduled for later that day against the Chicago Cubs to pay respect to Hancock.\nA police report revealed that Hancock was intoxicated at the time of his fatal accident with a blood-alcohol level of 0.157, nearly double the legal limit in Missouri. Police also found 8.55 grams of marijuana along with a glass smoking pipe in his vehicle, although toxicology tests later proved no drugs were in his system except alcohol. In addition, Hancock was talking on a cell phone when the accident occurred and was not wearing a seatbelt. An accident reconstruction team determined that Hancock was driving 68 mph in a 55 mph zone.\nMedia coverage.\nThis was the first season of Fox's new media agreement lasting through 2013. \"Fox Saturday Baseball\" expanded to the entire 26 weeks of the regular season, up from 18 under the previous contract. Fox also retained exclusive rights to televise the World Series and the All-Star Game. Fox would also get exclusive rights to televise the American League Championship Series in odd-numbered years, and the National League Championship Series in even-number years.\nTBS also signed a deal lasting through 2013, As part of the contract, TBS relinquished its rights to air Atlanta Braves games nationally after the 2007 season, by separating WTBS (now WPCH) channel 17 from the TBS network, eventually rebranding as \"Peachtree TV\" on October 1, 2007. TBS also gained exclusive broadcast rights to the Division Series in both leagues, any tiebreaking games, the National League Championship Series in odd-numbered years, and the American League Championship Series in even-number years. Additionally, TBS gained the rights to a Sunday afternoon \"Game of the Week\" beginning in 2008.\nESPN continued to televise games on Sunday nights, Wednesday nights, and other weeknights, but no longer any postseason games."

The head coach is Kim Mulkey, the former head coach at Baylor University, who was hired on April 25, 2021 to replace Nikki Fargas, who had been head coach since the 2011–2012 season. The team plays its home games in the Pete Maravich Assembly Center located on the LSU campus in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\nLSU is the 2023 NCAA national champion, having defeated Iowa 102–85 in the national championship game.\nHistory.\nThrough the 2018–19 season, LSU has made 27 AIAW/NCAA tournament appearances including 14 Sweet Sixteens, eight Elite Eights, and six Final Fours. The Lady Tigers have won the SEC regular season championship three times and the SEC Tournament championship twice.\nColeman-Swanner era.\nThe LSU women's basketball team started play in 1975 as the \"Ben-Gals,\" with coach Jinks Coleman. In just their second season of play, the team made it to the AIAW national championship game before losing to top-ranked Delta State, 68–55. Coleman stepped down in the middle of the 1978–79 season and was replaced by Barbara Swanner, who in turn led the team for three and a half seasons. The 1981–82 season saw the NCAA become the governing body of collegiate women's basketball. LSU did not play in the first NCAA tournament.\nSue Gunter era.\nFuture Hall of Fame coach Sue Gunter was hired to replace Swanner. Gunter would lead the Lady Tigers for the next 22 seasons. Gunter led the Lady Tigers to 14 NCAA tournament appearances. Although she only won three regular season titles, for most of her tenure the SEC was dominated by national powers Tennessee, Auburn and Ole Miss. Gunter took a medical leave of absence in the middle of the 2003–04 season. Her top assistant, Pokey Chatman, who had played for Gunter in the late 1980s and early 1990s and served as an assistant coach since the end of her playing days, took over as interim coach and led the Tigers to their first Final Four. However, Gunter was still officially head coach, and LSU credits the entire season to her. Gunter retired after the season, and Chatman was named her permanent successor.\nPokey Chatman era.\nPokey Chatman led the team to two more consecutive Final Four appearances and was highly regarded as coach. However, during the 2006–2007 season, just prior to the NCAA Tournament, Chatman resigned after allegations of improper conduct with a former player surfaced. She was replaced on an interim basis by longtime assistant Bob Starkey, who coached the team during the 2007 NCAA tournament, leading them to a fourth consecutive Final Four. \nVan Chancellor era (2006–2011).\nVan Chancellor, the former head coach for Ole Miss and the Houston Comets, was hired at the end of the 2006–2007 season as a permanent replacement. In his first year as coach, Chancellor led the Lady Tigers to the SEC regular season championship.

LSU joined UConn as the only two schools ever to reach five consecutive Final Fours.\nLSU NCAAW has officially beat 150/153 teams as of 2023.\nKim Mulkey era (2021–present).\nOn April 25, 2021, LSU announced the signing of Kim Mulkey to replace Fargas as head coach. Mulkey played at Louisiana Tech, where she also went on to be an assistant and associate head coach for 15 years. Prior to accepting the offer to coach LSU, she was the head coach for Baylor University, where she won three national championships in 21 seasons.\nOn December 2, 2021, Mulkey led the team to their first win versus a ranked team by defeating #14 Iowa State 69–60 in the Maravich Center giving the team a 7–1 record for the year.\nOn April 2, 2023, LSU would defeat the Iowa Hawkeyes, by the score of 102–85, to win their first ever national championship; the game also marked the highest scoring championship game in women's NCAA history.\nIn April 2024, the team made international headlines after it missed the singing of the national anthem before their NCAA Tournament defeat against Iowa.

It is a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) since May 1, 1991. The TBHF is based in Ankara and its current chairman is Orhan Duman.\nTBHF conducts seven ice hockey leagues for men's and women's. The federation organizes also the national teams for men's, men's junior, men's U-18 and women's. As of October 2012, Turkey men's national team ranks 39th and the women's 35th in the world.\nHistory.\nIce hockey playing started in Turkey in the beginning of the 1980s at Atatürk ice rink and on the frozen pool of Youth Park in Ankara and Korukent ice rink in Istanbul. The first ice hockey match dates back to January 9, 1988 played at Atatürk ice rink in Ankara between the teams of Ankara and Istanbul, which were coached by an American Glenn Brown and Sinisha Tomic from Yugoslavia respectively.\nBy February 1989, the \"Buz Pateni Sarayı\" (literally \"Ice Skating Palace\"), country's first Olympic size hockey rink was opened in Ankara, which initiated the ice hockey in Turkey. Founding of an ice hockey school the same year by Cüneyt Kozan and Fahri Paslı was one of the most basic and important steps in the development of this sport branch in Turkey. Some of the sportspeople, who learnt playing ice hockey at this school, are still members of the national team.\nAnkara Buz Pateni Sarayı hosted the first match ever played in compliance with the international rules and regulations end of 1989 between Ankara Tarım Kredi Spor and Istanbul Paten Kulübü teams.\nBy January 1990, ice hockey sport was subordinated to the Turkish Ski Federation, and the first official championship ever was organized among two teams from Ankara and two from Istanbul.\nWith the foundation of the Turkish Ice Sports Federation in 1991, ice hockey sport separated from the Turkish Ski Federation and came along with figure skating sport under the authority of the new organization. Turkey became a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation IIHF the same year, and formed the national team to participate at the 1992 World championships Group C tournaments.\nThe rising interest in ice hockey effected the increasing number of players and then the teams. Rino Ouellette, a Canadian diplomat in Ankara, who coached two teams consecutively, contributed much to the development of ice hockey sport in Turkey. A tournament, organized in 1992, laid the ground stone for the establishment of Turkey's first ice hockey league in 1993.\nAs of March 2013, the total number of ice hockey players is 790 consisting of 310 men's, 320 juniors and 160 women's. From 1992 on, the federation conducted regularly courses for referees and trainers. There are a total of 110 referees as of March 2013.\nUnder increasing competition pressure, the teams were forced to transfer valuable players from countries with ice hockey tradition like Canada, Russia, Ukraine etc. The presence of the foreign sportspeople contributed considerable to the enhancement of this sport resulting in Turkey's first international win in 1997 against New Zealand.\nIn the end of 2006, ice hockey sport detached on International Skating Union's recommendation from the Turkish Ice Sports Federation establishing its own organization.\nDomestic events and teams.\nThe TBHF conducts in the 2012-2013 season seven leagues.

        "title": "Figure skating at the 2006 Winter Olympics – Pair skating",
        "text": "Pair skating was contested during the figure skating events at the 2006 Winter Olympics.\nThis event is performed by partners consisting of a female and male skater. The competition consists of two segments. A short program is skated first, with eight required elements performed within 2 minutes and 50 seconds. All pairs progress to the free skating, where each pair skates for 4 minutes and 30 seconds. There were 20 pairs who competed at the 2006 Games.\nShort program.\nThe pairs' short program was the first figure skating event of the Olympics, and took place on 11 February, with the free skating completed on 13 February. Two-time World Champions and Russians Tatiana Totmianina / Maxim Marinin were the pre-tournament favorites to win. They were expected to be challenged by two-time World Champions and reigning Olympic bronze medalists Shen Xue / Zhao Hongbo, but an injury to Zhao initially kept them out of contention for the gold medal. However, the team was able to get back into shape for the Olympics.\nTotmianina and Marinin took the lead after the short program, with a score of 68.64 points. Zhang Dan / Zhang Hao of China, skating to Led Zeppelin's song \"Kashmir\", ranked second with 64.72 points, followed closely by Maria Petrova / Alexei Tikhonov of Russia with 64.27 points. Close behind were two other Chinese pairs, Pang Qing / Tong Jian (63.19 points) and Shen Xue / Zhao Hongbo (62.32 points). Americans Rena Inoue / John Baldwin made history in the short program by landing the first throw triple Axel in Olympic competition, putting them in sixth place.\nFree skating.\nIn free skating, Totmianina / Marinin were described by NBC as \"untouchable\", and the pair scored a personal best 135.84 points in this segment for a combined score of 204.48. Their victory was described as \"a rout\" The pair had suffered a setback in 2004 when Marinin dropped Totmianina during a lift, putting her in the hospital with a concussion.\nThe Chinese pair of Zhang / Zhang were the last to take the ice on the night of the free skating. In trying to surpass the Russian pair, Zhang / Zhang attempted a throw quadruple salchow jump, never before completed successfully in competition. However, Zhang Dan fell on this element and suffered a painful injury to her knee. Since she was temporarily unable to continue, the music was stopped by the event referee. Upon the trainer's approval for Zhang Dan to continue, the couple continued their routine, skating with minor errors for the remaining four minutes. NBC reported that the entire crowd gave the pair a standing ovation and showed shots of their fellow competitors, including Totmianiana / Marinin, also standing. Finishing second in both parts of the competition, Zhang / Zhang received silver medals with an overall score of 189.73 points.\nTheir countrymen, Shen / Zhao, who were in fifth place after the short program, pulled up two places in the free skating to take the bronze medals, as they did at Salt Lake City four years earlier, with a total score of 186.91. They edged the third Chinese couple, Pang Qing / Tong Jian out of the podium by just 0.24 points.\nPetrova / Tikhonov, who were in third place after the short program, dropped to fifth place overall. Germans Aljona Sawtschenko / Robin Szolkowy, who were in seventh after the short, scored the fifth best total of the free skating competition to go up on spot. Inoue / Baldwin were unable to complete their throw triple Axel in the long and dropped to seventh overall.\nWhile Totmianina / Marinin extended the streak of gold medals in pairs for Russia and former Soviet Union to 12 consecutive Olympics, dating back to 1964, the silver medals for Zhang / Zhang are China's best ever achievement in Olympic figure skating. Up until this point, China had three bronze medals in figure skating: two from China's Chen Lu and one from Shen / Zhao.\nResults.\nFinal standings.\nReferee:\nTechnical Controller:\nTechnical Specialist:\nAssistant Technical Specialist:\nJudges:"

        "text": "The West Indian cricket team toured England in 1980, spending virtually the whole of the 1980 English cricket season in England. West Indies also played two matches in Ireland and two in Scotland.\nThe highlights of the tour were a two-match One Day International series for the 1980 Prudential Trophy and a five-Test series for the Wisden Trophy, both against the English cricket team. West Indies were captained by Clive Lloyd, and England by Ian Botham. The ODI series was tied 1–1, and the Test series was ruined by rain. West Indies won the First Test, but the following four were all drawn due to weather interruptions, so West Indies won the series 1–0.\nDuring the second test at Lords, Viv Richards completed his 3,000 test runs in 54 innings at the time third fastest after Don Bradman and Everton Weekes.\nWest Indies also played numerous matches against the first-class counties and other minor teams, winning many of them. West Indies were only beaten twice on the tour, by Essex in a 50-over warm-up match, and by England in the Second ODI, both at the end of May. Thereafter, they were unbeaten until the tour ended in August\nSquads.\nGordon Greenidge,\nDesmond Haynes,\nFaoud Bacchus,\nViv Richards (vice captain),\nClive Lloyd (captain),\nDerick Parry,\nAlvin Kallicharan,\nLawrence Rowe,\nCollis King,\nDeryck Murray,\nDavid Murray,\nAndy Roberts,\nMichael Holding,\nJoel Garner,\nMalcolm Marshall,\nColin Croft.\nWhen Lawrence Rowe dropped out of the tour through injury, Larry Gomes was invited to replace him but declined as he had not played for two months. Timur Mohamed, who was at the time playing for Suffolk, joined the touring party instead.\nWarm-up matches.\nThe tour began with the traditional fixture against Lavinia, Duchess of Norfolk's XI at Arundel Castle on 8 May 1980. West Indies won the 45-over match by 121 runs.\nWest Indies spent most of the rest of May warming up for the matches against England. West Indies played 3-day matches against Worcestershire, Leicestershire and Northamptonshire, then two 50-over matches against Middlesex and two 50-over matches against Essex, and finally a 3-day match against Derbyshire. Except for the first one-day match against Middlesex on 20 May (which was rained off) and the first one-day match against Essex (won by Essex, the first loss by West Indies on the tour), all of these matches were won by West Indies.\nOne-day Internationals.\nThe West Indies won the Prudential Trophy on scoring rate.\n1st ODI.\nThe First ODI was held at Headingley on 28 May. England won the toss and put West Indies in to bat first. They reached 198 all out, with 78 from Gordon Greenidge. Joel Garner was run out off the last ball having scored 14. Play was interrupted by the weather, with England on 35/3 overnight, and resumed the next day, 29 May. Despite England's number 3, Chris Tavaré, reaching 82 not out, West Indies bowled England out for 174 off 51.2 overs to win by 24 runs.\n2nd ODI.\nThe Second ODI was played the following day, 30 May, at Lord's, with Viv Richards standing in as captain for Clive Lloyd. Again, England won the toss and put West Indies in to bat. They reached 235 for 9 off their 55 overs, led by a 50 from Desmond Haynes. Thanks to a century opening stand by Peter Willey (56) and Geoffrey Boycott (70), and 42 not out from Ian Botham, England reached their target off the third ball of the final over to win by 3 wickets.\nWest Indies then played and won a 3-day match against Kent.\nTest matches.\nFirst Test.\nThe First Test was played at Trent Bridge from 5 June. England won the toss and batted. Honours were fairly even between the West Indies pace bowling attack (Andy Roberts, Joel Garner, Michael Holding and Malcolm Marshall) and England's pace attack (Bob Willis, who took 9 wickets, supported by John Lever and Ian Botham) and the batsmen. West Indies were well placed at 109/2 at the end of the fourth day, chasing a target of 208 to win, and won by 2 wickets on the final day.\nThe tour continued with 3-day matches against a combined Oxford University and Cambridge University team, won by West Indies, and a draw against Sussex.\nSecond Test.\nThe Second Test was played at Lord's from 19 June. England again won the toss and batted. Graham Gooch reached 123, but had little support, with Holding and Garner in the wickets. West Indies replied with a mammoth 518, including a stand of 223 for the second wicket between Haynes (184) and Viv Richards (145). Weather interruptions left West Indies with insufficient time to bowl England out a second time, and the match ended in a draw with England on 133–2 in their second innings.\nWest Indies then played two matches against Ireland at Clontarf in Dublin on 25 June and 26 June, both affected by the weather. The first was drawn, and West Indies won the second on a faster run rate, with Faoud Bacchus reaching 163. West Indies then played a drawn 3-day match and won a 40-over match against Glamorgan, and won and drew 3-day matches against Gloucestershire and Somerset, respectively.\nThird Test.\nThe Third Test began on 10 July at Old Trafford. West Indies won the toss and put England in to bat, a good decision, as it turned out: England were bowled out for 150 on the first day. West Indies batted through the second day, and the third day was rained off, but they eventually were all out for 260 in reply, with a century by captain Clive Lloyd. England batted through most of the last two days, reaching 391–7 to draw the match.\nLittle play was possible on the first day of a 2-day match against Scotland at Forthill in Dundee on 17 July; the match was abandoned on the second day, and West Indies won the replacement 50-over match. West Indies then beat Yorkshire over 3 days.\nFourth Test.\nThe Fourth Test was played at The Oval from 24 July 1980. England won the toss and batted, reaching 370, with contributions through the batting order. Gooch top-scored on 83; Boycott (53) and Brian Rose (50) also reached half-centuries, and Mike Gatting just missed out on 48. Extras was second-highest scorer, on 57 – this was the second time that West Indies conceded over 50 extras in the Test series, having given 52 away in England's second innings in the First Test. No play was possible on the third day, and West Indies eventually conceded their first first-innings deficit of the Test series, all out for 265 (with captain Clive Lloyd absent hurt), and England were in trouble, at 18–4 just before the close on the fourth day, but batted through the final day to reach 209–9 declared, with England number 8 Peter Willey reaching 100 not out in an unbroken stand of 117 for the final wicket with Bob Willis (24*), and the match was drawn.\nWest Indies then drew a 2-day match against Minor Counties and a 3-day match against Warwickshire.\nFifth Test.\nThe Fifth and final Test was played at Headingley from 7 August. West Indies won the toss and decided to field. Again, the weather intervened. No play was possible on the first day. England were bowled out for 143 on the second day, with only two batsmen scoring more than 14 runs – captain Ian Botham (37) and wicketkeeper David Bairstow (40), who had replaced the regular keeper in the first four Tests, Alan Knott. West Indies reached 245 in reply, but the fourth day was also lost, and England reached 227–6 declared on the final day, with the series petering out with a fourth consecutive draw.\nThe West Indian team finished its tour with a third match against Essex, at Stamford Bridge on 14 August.\nAnnual reviews.\n "

The tournaments are sanctioned by World Lacrosse.\nThese championships were first held for men in 1988 and for women in 1995. They have only been held in the same year twice and both times in the same country; 1999 in Australia and 2003 in the United States. The United States has won every men's U-19 tournament and all but two women's U-19 tourneys.\nThe 2008 men's championship was held in July 2008 in Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada and was won by the United States. The 2012 men's tournament was held in Turku, Finland, with the United States winning the title, defeating Canada 10–8, despite a pair of pool-play losses to Canada and the Iroquois Nationals. The Iroquois Nationals finished third after an 18–1 win over England. The 2016 championship for men was held July 7–16, 2016, again in Coquitlam, British Columbia, just outside Vancouver. The U.S. won its eighth title, coming back from being down 6–0 to eventually defeat Canada 13–12.\nThe most recent championship for women was held in Edinburgh, Scotland in 2015. The Haudenosaunee Nationals women's lacrosse team could not participate due to British passport requirements. Canada won its first gold medal, defeating the United States 9–8 in the final.\nAt the 2022 event in Limerick, Ireland, a record number of 23 teams participated.\nThe next editions of the tournament will be under-20 competitions.

        "text": "Joshua S. Sims (born July 29, 1978) is an American former professional lacrosse player. He played in Major League Lacrosse through 2013 and last played box lacrosse in the National Lacrosse League with the Philadelphia Wings in 2010. He starred as a member of the Princeton Tigers men's lacrosse team from 1997 through 2000. He is a two-time NCAA champion, three-time MLL champion, and one-time NLL champion.\nAt Princeton, he earned Ivy League Player of the Year honors, three first team United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) All-American recognitions and three first team All-Ivy League selections, two NCAA midfielder of the year honors, NCAA Top VIII Award recognition and two-time Academic All-American (first team once) honors. During his college career, Princeton earned four Ivy League championships, four NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament invitations and two NCAA championships.\nAs a professional, he is a five-time MLL All-star and an NLL All-star. In the MLL, he has earned two league championships and holds the all-time league record for playoff goals scored. He also has an NLL championship. He was selected to the MLL 10th Anniversary team in August 2010 and the Colorado Mammoth 10th Anniversary team in 2011.\nSims is currently Head of Lacrosse for the Premier Lacrosse League.\nBackground.\nAs an ambidextrous junior lacrosse midfielder, he scored 20 goals and had 16 assists for the Severn School, earning him All-Anne Arundel County honors from the \"Baltimore Sun\". Sims was an All-Anne Arundel County selection by the \"Baltimore Sun\" again as a senior captain when he was also named an All-Metro selection for controlling 72% of his face-offs, while scoring 28 goals and adding 12 assists. Sims was a member of the Under-19 Team USA that won the World Championship in Tokyo in 1996.\nCollegiate career.\nAfter graduating from Severn, Sims attended Princeton University. He was the first Princeton Student-Athlete to be presented with the NCAA Top VIII Award (the first lacrosse player to be presented with the award since 1983). He was only the fourth Ivy League athlete honored in the award's 27-year history. He was awarded the 1998 &amp; 2000 McLaughlin Award as the best NCAA lacrosse midfielder. He was a first team USILA All-American Team selection in 1998, 1999 and 2000. He was also first team All-Ivy League in 1998, 1999 and 2000. Sims earned the 2000 Men's Ivy League Player of the Year. As a freshman, he was a member of the 1997 team that is regarded as the best in school history with a record number of wins during its 15–0 season. He served as co-captain of the 2000 team. Sims is one of two Princeton Lacrosse two-time Academic All-Americans. Following the 1999 season, he was selected as an at-large second team Academic All-American, and following the 2000 season, he was a first team selection. He was also a 2000 USILA Scholar All-American.\nThe 1997–2000 teams were 6–0 undefeated outright Ivy League Conference champions. Two of these undefeated league champions won the 1997 and 1998 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championships, becoming the first team to threepeat since Syracuse from 1988–90 and the first to be recognized to have done so without an NCAA scandal since Johns Hopkins from 1978–80. The 1999 and 2000 teams also earned NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship invitations, bringing the schools streak to eleven consecutive seasons.\nIn Sims' first game as a Tiger, he scored the game-winning goal in a 1997 overtime 7–6 victory over Johns Hopkins. Ten years later, ESPN described the goal as a \"leaping, behind-the-back\" shot, while the \"Baltimore Sun\" described the shot by saying that \". . .Sims flicked in a rebound shot blindly behind his back.\" He was recognized twice in 1997 as Ivy League Rookie of the Week. During the 1998 season, Sims became a scoring threat from midfield as most defenses focused on the All-American trio of Princeton attackmen (Jesse Hubbard, Chris Massey and Jon Hess). In the 1998 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament, Sims scored a game-high four goals in the quarterfinal 11–9 victory over Duke and a team-high three goals, including the game-winning goal in the semifinal 11–10 victory against Syracuse. For his efforts, he was named to the All-tournament team. In 1999, he scored a quadruple overtime game-winning goal helping Princeton secure it invitation to the 1999 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament with its seventh consecutive victory.

        "title": "Billy Moore (rugby league, born 1971)",
        "text": "Billy Moore (born 7 May 1971) is a former rugby league footballer who played as a or forward in the 1980s and 1990s. He played representative football for both Queensland and Australia.\nBackground.\nMoore was born in Tenterfield, New South Wales and raised in Wallangarra, Queensland. He was born in Tenterfield as their town's hospital was closer to Wallangarra than the one in Stanthorpe. Moore was quoted as saying, \"My Mum assures me I was rushed back to the Channel Country before the oxygen had time to affect my lungs.\"\nHe attended Wallangarra State School and, later, Stanthorpe State High School and began playing his junior rugby league for the Wallangarra Bulls. At 15, he played his first senior game for Inglewood-Milmerran against Warwick.\nWhen the Wallangarra Bulls club folded, Moore began playing for the Tenterfield Tigers, where he was selected to represent New South Wales under-17s in 1988. Later that year, after representing Queensland Schoolboys, Moore received contract offers from the North Sydney Bears, Penrith Panthers, Brisbane Broncos and Parramatta Eels, signing with the Bears.\nPlaying career.\nIn 1989, Moore moved to Sydney to join the North Sydney Bears and played in the club's reserve grade premiership side. In 2019, Moore recalled when he first joined the club saying, \"All this talk about the Bears being losers, I didn't give a shit about it, I hated it. I despised the fact that we even mentioned it, because that was the legacy of the past, that wasn't something we'd carry into the future\".\nWith a radical change of the guard the following year, Moore and a number of other players (including long-time back-row partner David Fairleigh) became regular first graders the following year and propelled the club from also-rans in 1989 to finalists in 1991. Although Moore damaged a jaw at the start of that year, he played superbly in the first semi-final win by the Bears for 39 years against Manly, scoring two tries. Moore was first selected in Queensland's State of Origin side in 1992. Moore was the sole try-scorer in the Maroons' 5-4 win in the second match of the series at Lang Park.\nMoore was a regular selection for the maroon jersey for three seasons and famously yelled 'Queenslander! Queenslander!' in an attempt to motivate an underdog Maroons team on their way out of the tunnel in 1995 Moore was reacting to the fact that New South Wales players had said they would belt the first person that said he was a Queenslander. The young Queenslanders won the series 3 nil without its star Super League players. While Moore was initially overlooked for Test duty against New Zealand, he won a place in Australia's World Cup squad at the end of the year. He made one appearance in the competition, against South Africa, before playing further ARL Tests against Fiji (1996) and Rest of the World (1997) in consecutive years.\nHe continued to play for his club in subsequent semi-final campaigns but his representative career ended when he was left out of the Queensland team for the 1998 series. At the end of 1999, Moore failed to secure a contract with the merged Northern Eagles club and reluctantly retired.\nAs part of the South Sydney Rabbitohs push to be reinstated in first grade, Moore played for the club in promotional games to raise money and awareness and to gain support of the rugby league community for a readmission into the NRL which was ultimately successful in 2002.\nPost playing.\nIn 2000, Moore was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league. In August, 2006 he was named in the North Sydney Bears' \"Team of the Century\". He now co-owns a restaurant on Queensland's Sunshine Coast.\nIn 2011, Moore became the ambassador for a second Brisbane NRL expansion team.\nIn 2015, Moore became a panelist on Fox Sports for the NRL 360 show. In July 2015, Moore was forced to apologize after making derogatory comments regarding the New Zealand Warriors playing style. Moore read a statement saying “I would like to sincerely apologise to anyone that was offended by my comment regarding the New Zealand Warriors playing style, particularly the Polynesian community – many of whom I played with and am great mates with\".\nIn 2017, Moore advocated for the return of the North Sydney Bears as a merged entity with the Gold Coast Titans. There were talks of Norths buying the Gold Coast licence with the club being rebranded as the Gold Coast Bears, which would have also resulted in the creation of a new logo and the return of the famous red and black colors. At the end of 2017, the bid ultimately failed with the licence being purchased by Rebecca Frizelle and Darryl Kelly."

        "title": "Florida Atlantic Owls baseball",
        "text": "The Florida Atlantic Owls are the college baseball team of Florida Atlantic University which plays its home games at FAU Baseball Stadium. The Owls' head coach is John McCormack.\nFielding its first team in 1981, the Florida Atlantic University baseball team has experienced frequent success, shared respect from other baseball teams nationwide and the building of a power in NCAA baseball.\nAs of the 2023 season, the Owls have had 24 consecutive winning seasons. Additionally, the Owls have had only four losing seasons in 42 years of competition.\nOverview and history.\nFlorida Atlantic University's baseball program began in 1981 and has seen success, growth and change in its 41 seasons of competition. Among the changes, the most noticeable to fans would be the change of the team name in 2005. University President Frank T. Brogan led the charge for the university to create a unified, single mark for FAU's athletic programs. The student-body decided \"Owls\" should be the athletic logo and in 2005, the baseball team lost its previous identity of \"Blue Wave.\" Over the 30 years of competition, FAU baseball has jumped from the NAIA, to NCAA Division II, to NCAA Division I competition, and has reached success on all levels.\nSteve Traylor era: The beginning.\nUnder its first coach and first year of competition, FAU won its inaugural game, 12–8, against St. Thomas University on February 23, 1981. Steve Traylor coached FAU from 1981–1987 and oversaw the building of a program from scratch. After only three years of existence, FAU jumped from the NAIA level to the NCAA Division II level. If there was any doubts about this young program belonging on that level, its very first season would prove any doubters wrong. The Blue Wave opened the 1984 season with a win against in-state super-power University of Florida Gators, 5–4. FAU continued to win its first five games of the season, including another major upset, this time on the road at another in-state super-power, defeating University of Miami Hurricanes, 11–10. The Blue Wave finished the 1984 season with a record of 40–15, ranked 8th in the nation in the final NCAA Division II poll.\nKevin Cooney era: Division I and national success.\nDuring the offseason between 1987 and 1988, Steve Traylor left Florida Atlantic to become the head coach at Duke University. FAU hired Kevin Cooney, head coach of Montclair State University in New Jersey. Since the hiring, FAU has won 61% of their games and transformed itself from a local power in South Florida to a national baseball program on the Division I level. Coach Cooney arrived at FAU in 1988 and began his 20th season as head coach of the Owls on opening night of the 2007 season. Given the success and unprecedented heights that Cooney has taken FAU baseball, \"Florida Atlantic\" and \"Kevin Cooney\" have become synonymous with one another. Entering the 2007 season, Cooney has won 680 games (at FAU) and 820 (all-time, between FAU and Montclair State University, his alma mater and where he coached from 1984–1987).\nIn his 19+ seasons in Boca Raton, Cooney has established a powerhouse program at a university that continues to grow. Cooney has led the charge for FAU baseball to enjoy such successes as, 67 athletes turning professional (with 4 reaching the majors). For these accolades and so much more, Cooney was inducted into the Palm Beach County Sports Hall of Fame in 2007.\nOn March 15, 2006, against Columbia University, Cooney reached a personal milestone, coaching a team to his 800th career victory.\nOn Thursday, April 24, 2008, Cooney announced that the 2008 season would be his last season as head coach of the Owls. Subsequently, on May 24, exactly a month after this announcement, Cooney coached his last game as FAU head coach when the Owls lost to Western Kentucky in the play-in championship game of the Sun Belt Conference championship Tournament.\nAll-time consecutive wins record.\nDuring the improbable 1999 season, when FAU finished with a school-best record of 54–9, Cooney led his team to an NCAA all-time record for consecutive wins. Starting February 19, in a 7–4 win over Bethune-Cookman College, the Blue Wave continued on to 34 consecutive wins. The streak lasted all the way to April 17, when Jacksonville University topped FAU, 2–1. The streak ended two days short of lasting two complete calendar months.\nMarch to 800.\nCooney's milestone wins:\nJohn McCormack era: Sooner than five years.\nOn July 1, 2008, Florida Atlantic named 18-year Assistant Coach, John McCormack, as Cooney's successor. McCormack served as Cooney's top assistant, associate head coach and recruiting coordinator for the 18 seasons before being elevated as head coach. With the foundation laid by Cooney, McCormack leads the Owls under intense pressure and high expectations. In 2019, John McCormack was inducted into the FAU Athletics Hall of Fame.\nIndividual records and honors.\nFAU Baseball Hall of Fame.\nIn 2006, Florida Atlantic University inducted the first class to its new FAU Baseball Hall of Fame.\nAll-Americans.\n17 players from FAU baseball have won recognition as \"All-American\": Keith Foley (1983), Mike Ryan (1984), Scott Hay (1986), Jack Penrod (1988), Todd Moser (1999), Dan Jackson (1999), Dickie Hart (1999), Randy Beam (2003), Jeff Fiorentino (2004), Mickey Storey (2005), Robbie Widlansky (2007), Mike McKenna (2008), Andy Mee (2010), Hugh Adams (2013), Brendon Sanger (2015), Rickey Santiago (2015), C.J. Chatham (2016).\nFreshmen All-Americans.\n8 players from FAU baseball have won recognition as \"Freshmen All-American\": Kevin Connacher (1994), Rusty Brown (2001), Chris Pillsbury (2001), Jeff Fiorentino (2002), Derek Hutton (2002), Tim Mascia (2003), Mickey Storey (2005), Stephen Kerr (2014).\n2005 Mickey Storey.\nIn 2005, as a freshman pitcher for FAU, Mickey Storey was named \"Collegiate Baseball's\" National Freshman Pitcher of the Year. Storey's stat line for his freshman season was one of the best posted by a pitcher in the nation.\nStorey's 1.70 ERA is a school-record for a single-season, and ranked fifth in the nation for the 2005 season among pitchers on the Division I level. His performance during the 2005 season awarded him an invitation to try out for the USA Baseball National Team.\nStorey also took home numerous other awards that season, including All-American honors, Freshman All-American honors, All-Conference honors, and All-Conference Freshman honors.\n2007 Robbie Widlansky.\nIn 2007 Robbie Widlansky won the Sun Belt Conference batting title his senior season (.430 average; breaking the school's season record), and Sun Belt Player of the Year, NCAA All-American honors, and First-Team All-Conference honors.\nPostseason records.\nFlorida Atlantic is 22-25 all-time in NCAA Division I postseason history (22–23 all-time in NCAA Regionals and 0–2 in NCAA Super Regionals).\nProfessional Owls.\nOwls in the majors.\nFlorida Atlantic Owls to reach Major League Baseball:"

        "text": "The US Pro Golf Tour was a developmental men's professional golf tour in the United States. The tour was founded by R. Thomas Kidd in 2005 and ran until early 2007, when it ran into financial difficulties.\nIn order to gain access to investment capital, the US Pro Golf Tour was reverse acquired by Greens Worldwide Incorporated in June 2005. In 2006, several existing regional mini-tours were acquired to serve as feeders to the US Pro Golf Tour, including the New England Pro Golf Tour and the Texas-based Tight Lies Tour, and new regional tours were created in Florida and California. Plans to acquire the Tarheel Tour, based in North Carolina, fell through. A deal was also signed with Donald Trump to sponsor four major tournaments on the tour.\nFinancial problems were apparent in mid-2016, when net losses of $8.7 million were reported, prize money had not been paid in a timely manner for events in New England, tournaments were canceled or relocated, and charities received their contributions months late. In January 2007, Trump withdrew his sponsorship following a change in management at Greens Worldwide when Kidd departed. In February 2007, the tour declared insolvency and operations were suspended. Hundreds of players were left out of pocket having paid thousands of dollars in membership and tournament entry fees when the 2007 season was canceled, and new management only offered to transfer those fees to a promised 2008 season, which did not happen.\nTelevision coverage.\nThe US Pro Golf Tour purchased air-time for its tournaments. The inaugural tournament in 2015 was broadcast on Golf Channel, and ten tournaments during 2016 were broadcast on Fox Sports, with the four Trump tournaments on ESPN."

        "text": "William Stuart Lancaster (born 9 October 1969) is an English rugby union coach and former player who currently works as the head coach of French Top 14 club Racing 92. \nAfter managing Leeds Tykes/Carnegie and the England Saxons, Lancaster was appointed as the head coach of the English national team in 2011 until he stepped down in 2015, following the World Cup. He then joined Leinster as a senior coach the following year where he won one European Rugby Champions Cup in 2018 as well as four Pro 14 championships within a staff run by Leo Cullen before leaving for Racing 92 in 2023. \nEarly life and education.\nWilliam Stuart Lancaster was born on in Penrith, Cumberland. He grew up in the village of Culgaith, where he was sent to St. Bees School. He started his rugby playing career at the school playing for the 1st XV, in a rugby league area. He started in the front row as a hooker, although at the age of 15, he moved to flanker where he played his best rugby. After leaving school in 1988, Lancaster headed to Carnegie College in Leeds to train as a PE Teacher, while continuing his rugby career playing for Wakefield RFC. After qualifying in 1991, he began teaching at Kettlethorpe High School.\nPlaying career.\nIn 1991 Lancaster started playing for Headingley RFC. When Headingley merged with Roundhay RUFC, Lancaster joined the newly formed team Leeds RFU, where he would play the remainder of career. In 1998, he took a substantial leave from teaching to become a full-time professional rugby player with Leeds Tykes, of which he became the first Leeds player to play a century of games since the amalgamation of Headingley and Roundhay, and was named captain of newly branded team.\nThrough his Scottish mother he played for Scotland Students, Scotland U19 and Scotland U21. Lancaster was forced to retire from playing rugby aged 30. A teenage Tom Palmer, who would later play under Lancaster, hit a tackle bag that Stuart was holding, tearing his hamstring off the bone completely.\nCoaching career.\nLeeds Tykes/Carnegie.\nAfter retiring in 2000, Lancaster ran the Leeds RFU Academy for five years from 2001. However, in 2006 after Leeds Tykes were relegated after the 2005–06 Guinness Premiership season, Lancaster replaced Phil Davies as head coach before the 2006–07 National Division One. In Lancaster's debut season, he led Leeds to promotion with 122 points. The victory was without high-profile players like Justin Marshall and Iain Balshaw. Now back in the top flight English rugby competition, Leeds Carnegie – the renamed title of the club – remained bottom of the table for the whole season, only getting 2 victories from 22, and were relegated at the end of the 2007–08 Guinness Premiership season. Lancaster later departed the club after being appointed RFU's Elite Rugby Director.\nEngland Saxons and head of elite player development.\nRob Andrew, the RFU's Elite Rugby Director announced Lancaster's appointment on 6 May 2008 stating \"This is a very important appointment for the department. Stuart brings Guinness Premiership coaching experience and is also one of the coaches who has achieved the Elite Coaching Level 5 qualification.\" The move was taken poorly by the owners of Leeds Carnegie the club where he was Director of Rugby before joining the RFU, who felt they should have been contacted regarding the appointment.\nPart of Lancaster's role was to develop younger players, which saw Lancaster coach the England Saxons during the 2008 Churchill Cup winning campaign. This included a 62–10 win over the United States and a 34–12 win over the Ireland Wolfhounds, to set up a Cup Final against Scotland A, of which England Saxons won 36–19. Lancaster returned to role for the 2010 Churchill Cup, which saw the Saxons win all three of their matches including the cup final against Canada, winning 38–18. He oversaw the Saxons sixth winning campaign during the 2011 Churchill Cup, which for the first time England hosted. The winning campaign included a record 87–8 victory over the United States and a 41–14 win over Tonga. They beat Canada for a second consecutive year, winning 37–6 at the Sixways Stadium in Worcester. In addition to the England Saxons, Lancaster also oversaw an impressive period for the England U20's team, which included a grand slam victory during the 2011 Six Nations Under 20s Championship and three finals berths in the IRB Junior World Championship between 2008 and 2011.\nEngland.\nLancaster's tenure as head coach has been praised for the overhaul and reformation of England's squad culture, which had resulted in much media attention to the team's off-field antics during the 2011 Rugby World Cup, which immediately preceded Lancaster's reign. Lancaster has demanded that England's players be good role models, and as such has excluded players from various squads. Examples of this policy include Danny Care's exclusion from the 2012 Six Nations Championship, and Manu Tuilagi's omission from England's 2015 Rugby World Cup preparations. However, Lancaster's team selections, particularly at centre, and his failure to select or develop a specialist openside flanker for England have been criticised.\nFollowing the 2011 Rugby World Cup, England head coach Martin Johnson resigned from his post, with the RFU appointing Lancaster as interim head coach for the 2012 Six Nations Championship, while the RFU continued to search for a full-time coach, with the likes of South African Nick Mallett and New Zealander Wayne Smith reportedly expressing interest in the vacant job. On 29 March 2012, following a second-place finish in the Six Nations campaign, Lancaster was appointed as the English head coach, keeping his assistants Graham Rowntree and Andy Farrell.\nLancaster's first match in charge as the official head coach came on 27 May 2012 against the Barbarians, which England won 57–26, though this was not a full test match. this was followed by a three test tour of South Africa. The 9 June clash with South Africa was Lancaster's first test match in charge, and England lost to the Springboks 22–17. A week later England were defeated again 36–27. However, in the final test on 23 June 2015, England secured a 14–14 draw, their first draw since 8 December 1906.\nDuring the 2012 end-of-year rugby union internationals, Lancaster led the English to narrow defeats to Australia 20–14 and South Africa 15–16, before leading England to a 38–21 victory over World Cup Champions New Zealand. Despite beating the No. 1 ranked team in the world, England's earlier losses proved costly, as they lowered England's seeding for the 2015 Rugby World Cup draw, held three years in advance. On 1 December 2012, England were drawn in Pool A for the World Cup, alongside Australia and Wales.\nDuring 2013, Lancaster led England to second in the Six Nations for a second consecutive year. Lancaster led the team to a 12–6 victory over Ireland in Ireland, England's first victory in Ireland since their 2003 Grand Slam triumph. England could have claimed their first grand slam since 2003, however a record 30–3 loss to Wales in the final week at the Millennium Stadium, saw Wales claim the Six Nations title. The scale of the defeat saw Lancaster criticised for his selection of inside centre, and the balance of England's back row, which lacked a breakdown specialist to compete with Wales' Sam Warburton and Justin Tipuric.\nIn the summer of 2013, Lancaster led England to a 2–0 test series victory over Argentina, with England winning their matches by 32–3 and 51–26 on Argentine soil. On 2 November 2013, Lancaster reclaimed the Cook Cup after leading England to a 20–13 victory over Australia, before beating Argentina for a third consecutive time 31–12. England's 2013 Autumn campaign ended with a 22–30 loss to the All Blacks, who retained the Hillary Shield after losing it in 2012.\nIn 2014, England finished second in the Six Nations for a third time under Lancaster, with a loss against France, 26–24 in Paris, coming in the opening week of the tournament. England did however record a 20–0 victory over Scotland in Edinburgh, which was the first time Scotland had failed to score any points against England since 1978, and defeated Wales, Ireland, and Italy.\nDuring England's 2014 tour to New Zealand, Lancaster narrowly lost to the All Blacks 20–15 at Eden Park. In this first test, the English team did not feature any Saracens or Northampton Saints players due to a scheduling clash with the 2013–14 Aviva Premiership final a week before the opening test, when Lancaster needed his squad to attend England's training camp. The second test, where Saracens and Saints players returned to the starting XV, saw England lose by a single point, losing 28–27 in Dunedin. New Zealand won the final test 36–13 to claim a 3–0 series victory over England. England started their 2014 Autumn campaign with a fourth consecutive match against the World Champions, which saw New Zealand win 24–21. In the following week, England lost their fifth consecutive match, their worst run of defeats since their 7 consecutive losses in 2006, losing 31–28 to South Africa. The losing streak ended on 22 November, when England beat Samoa 28–9, while on 29 November, Lancaster led England against Australia to win 26–17.\nDuring the 2015 Six Nations Championship, Lancaster led England to a fourth consecutive second position in the Six Nations. Lancaster was applauded for his coaching during the opening match against Wales, which saw an England side depleted due to injury beat a first choice Welsh side 21–16 in Cardiff. England lost one match, to eventual champions Ireland, 19–9 in Dublin.\nDuring England's preparations for the 2015 World Cup, Lancaster took the squad to Colorado for a 2-week training programme, followed by tests against France and Ireland. England beat France at Twickenham 19–14, but lost the return fixture 25–20. Their final warm-up match saw England beat Ireland 21–13.\nDuring the 2015 Rugby World Cup, Lancaster led England to their worst ever performance at a World Cup. England became the first English team, and the first former World Champions to be knocked out in the group stages of the tournament. Having beaten Fiji in the opening match 35–11, England went on to lose to both Wales, 28–25, and Australia 33–13. Not only did this mean England were eliminated from the tournament after only three weeks of matches, but until the final week there was a risk that England may not finish third to automatically qualify for the 2019 Rugby World Cup. After Uruguay's loss to Fiji on 6 October and England's third-place finish, qualification for 2019 was confirmed. The 33–13 loss against Australia was England's largest ever defeat to Australia at Twickenham. A week after being knocked out of their own World Cup, England played their first home match away from Twickenham in over a decade. They faced Uruguay at the City of Manchester Stadium, winning 60–3. The match saw Lancaster select his 20th mid-field (fly-half and centre combination) in his 4 years in charge. Inconsistent mid-field selection was one of the main issues on which England's early departure from the World Cup was blamed. \nFollowing the conclusion of the 2015 Rugby World Cup, Lancaster, along with his assistant coaches and the RFU, were particularly severely criticised for their handling of Rugby League convert, Sam Burgess. Lancaster had selected Burgess to play for England as a centre, despite Burgess being developed as a flanker by his club Bath, and despite Burgess's relative inexperience, having only played 17 games for his club. Lancaster's selection appeared to be inconsistent with some of his previously stated principles, that he would select players based on form, and that he would not select outsiders, such as English players based in the Top 14, in part because it might unsettle players who had been in the England squad for a number of seasons. Burgess left Rugby Union to return to Rugby League shortly after the conclusion of the Rugby World Cup. Mike Ford, Burgess's coach at Bath, later stated that he felt Burgess would have stayed in Rugby Union had he not been picked in England's World Cup squad.\nOn 11 November 2015, Lancaster announced his resignation as England Head Coach, taking full \"responsibility for the team's performance during the tournament\".\nLeinster.\nOn 5 September 2016, Leinster announced that Lancaster would join their backroom team with immediate effect as a senior coach. It had been thought that the coaching staff for Leinster was complete, however the sudden departure of Kurt McQuilkin, due to family reasons, meant there was a position available. He was hailed as an inspirational coach by the Leinster players following the sides victory over Racing 92 in the 2018 Champions Cup final. During his time at the club and as part of the senior coaching team, Leinster also won four Guinness PRO12/14 titles. On 26 September 2022, Leinster Rugby announced that Lancaster would be leaving to join French Top 14 side Racing 92 for the following season.\nRacing 92.\nOn 30 June 2023, Racing 92 officially announced the appointment of Lancaster as first-team head coach alongside assistants Dimitri Szarzewski, Frédéric Michalak and Joe Rokocoko.\nHonours.\nPlayer.\nWakefield\nLeeds\nCoach.\nLeeds Tykes\nEngland Saxons\nEngland\nLeinster"

He became his country's first Commonwealth medallist with an unexpected silver medal behind Linford Christie in the 100 metres. He had not attended the opening ceremony as his country did not have enough money for a uniform and his story attracted much public sympathy and attention from the press. His meteoric rise (improving from 10.34 seconds to 10.02 over two days) was swiftly punctured as he was banned for two years after his doping test came back positive for the steroid stanozolol."

They played two first class matches between 30 December 1956 and 8 January 1957, winning one and losing one.\nThe tour coincided with the English tour of South Africa, thus no players who were part of that touring party played on this tour. Neither were any of the players that had beaten Australia in the final Test of 1956. Nevertheless, with the exception of wicket-keeper Jock Livingston the entire touring party of twelve had previous Test experience, eight of them for England and three of them for Australia.\nMatches.\n30 December–2 January: Bengal Chief Minister's XI vs CG Howard's XI.\nThe first match was a part of the celebrations for the silver jubilee of the Bengal Cricket Association. The hosting eleven, representing Bidhan Chandra Roy as Chief Minister of West Bengal, turned a first innings deficit around to a win after the tourists' wicket-keeper Livingston and No. 3 batsman Graveney were both forced to miss the second innings due to illness. Seven of the select XI had featured in the 3-Test series against Australia in October and November, while three of the remaining four had been dropped from the scene in the early 1950s. Nari Contractor had played in the final Test against Australia and now made 73 not out on New Year's Eve and continued towards 157 on New Year's Day. On the first day, the tourists' Australian spinners Dooland and Tribe took seven wickets, before Edrich made 58 for the tourists against the hosts' spinners Ghulam and Subhash Gupte, who shared eight between them. With Livingston and Graveney out, Howard's eleven was 16 for nought overnight on the final day chasing 301 to win, but were bowled out by Ghulam and Vinoo Mankad.\n5 January–8 January: Cricket Club of India President's XI vs CG Howard's XI.\nAnother strong eleven were fielded by the Cricket Club of India's President at the club's home, the Brabourne Stadium in Bombay. The side included four players who had featured in the Test series against Australia and a further five players with Test experience. The tourists had brought in McCool as replacement for the injured Livingston. It was the only time in first-class cricket that McCool kept wicket and he responded by stumping Vinoo Mankad off the bowling of Dooland. Graveney, who had been taken ill during the previous match, now responded with a pair of centuries as the tourists batted the hosts out of the game. The Cricket Club of India's first innings included a fall from 113 for three to 171 all out after Vijay Hazare retired on 32.\nTour aftermath.\nFrom the touring side, Tom Graveney, Alan Moss, Fred Trueman and Willie Watson all returned to the England Test team. Graveney had already played more than 15 Tests for England, though he had been left out of the side for the final three Tests of the 1956 Ashes, but returned to make 472 runs at a batting average over 100 in the 3–0 win over West Indies in 1957. Trueman established himself as a player in that 1957 series, taking 23 wickets after having been in and out of the team since he was first called up to play Indian cricket team in England in 1952. Both played major parts in England Test history well into the 1960s, with Trueman becoming the first player ever to take 300 Test wickets. Moss and Watson featured in a few Tests during the final years of the 1950s, but did not make major contributions."

        "text": "The India national cricket team toured Australia in the 1947–48 season to play a five-match Test series against Australia. Australia won the series 4–0, with one match drawn.\nThis was India's inaugural tour of Australia and it was also the first tour by a team representing the newly independent India. Independence had been finalised only two months before the tour began.\nAs evident from the scoreline, the Australian team greatly outclassed the Indians, who had some good individual performances to their credit. However, they did not put up much resistance as a team, with their batting failing to make any impression on the Australians. The only silver lining for India in terms of match results was their two victories in the First Class Matches.\nTouring party.\nA sub-committee under the chairmanship of Anthony de Mello was formed to recommend to the BCCI the India team to tour Australia the following season. The touring party comprising 17 players was announced 17 March 1947. A series of games were played prior to the selection to select a team for the tour that included the following day. For the touring squad, Vijay Merchant was named the captain and Lala Amarnath, his deputy. Pankaj Gupta was named the tour manager. Merchant had to drop out in September due to issues with his fitness; also Rusi Modi for the same reason. Amarnath was subsequently named the captain. Fazal Mahmood was dropped out as he joined Pakistan cricket team and Syed Mushtaq Ali was also dropped out in early October. Chandu Sarwate, Kanwar Rai Singh, Ranvirsinhji and C. R. Rangachari were named as their replacements on 6 October, while Hazare was named the vice-captain. The squad left for Australia on 8 October and arrived on 10 October in Darwin.\nThe team members were:\nFirst-class matches.\nIn addition to the Test series, the tourists played nine other first-class matches against Western Australia (2 games – the tour opener and the last game of the tour); South Australia; Victoria; New South Wales; Australia XI; Queensland; and Tasmania (2 matches). India won two and lost three of these matches, the other four being drawn.\nTest series summary.\n1st Test.\nMatch background\nThe Indian team had played six first-class matches prior to this match, and they had a below-par win–loss ratio of one win and two losses, both being innings defeats. Australia, though, had a remarkable record in their last ten test series, winning eight of them, and three out of a total three series after the war. Their win–loss record was exemplary as well, winning 29 and losing only 7, out of 45 tests. However, the Indian team had reason to believe that they could punch above their weight, as they had unearthed in Vinoo Mankad, a talented all-rounder, who had taken 39 wickets in those six matches, and had also scored 516 runs from 11 innings at an average of 46.90, and their captain Lala Amarnath's good run with the bat and the emergence of a future batting stalwart for India, Vijay Hazare, made India's prospects look a little brighter. However, Australia's captain, Don Bradman was a major stumbling block in India's path. At the start of the series his record was: 42 test matches, 5773 runs, Average of 97.84. Worryingly, for the touring side, He had already scored heavily against the Indian attack for the Australian XI outfit against India, an imposing 172. So his presence meant definite trouble for Lala Amarnath's side.\nMatch Report\nThe Brisbane pitch was quite benign and did not trouble the Australians, who chose to bat first after winning the toss. The Australian top order were in full control of the match from the start, stringing partnerships effectively. Don Bradman scored 185, piling on runs and misery on the Indian bowlers, who toiled in vain on a pitch that did not support them. He anchored partnerships with the other batsmen, and even when he ran out of partners, Wisden noted, \"...but completely demoralised the bowlers by punishing methods which brought runs at a terrific rate.\" his knock contained twenty fours. Australia ended the first day with their scorecard reading: 273/3, and Bradman being unbeaten on 160.\nIn the second day, only one hour of play was possible due to rain, and Australia went through the scheduled hour of play without losing a wicket, and adding 36 runs more. Surprisingly, a large attendance of 11,000 people came to watch the day's play. The third day of the match saw yet another burst of rain, which saturated the pitch. Bradman had been dismissed by then for a two-hundred-and-eighty-five-minute vigil that yielded 185 runs, placed Australia on a safe perch at 382 for 8. Realizing that the uncovered pitch could be advantageous for Australia's bowlers, Bradman declared; leaving the Indian side the daunting prospect of negotiating, what, in Wisden's words, was a \"treacherous\" pitch.\nThe Indian batsmen, who were accustomed to \"...the fast, hard pitches in their own country...\", could not cope up with the Australian bowling, and especially struggled against the bowling of Ernie Toshack, who exploited the conditions in a versatile manner, and in an extremely short spell of nineteen balls, returned remarkable figures of 5 wickets for a solitary run. The Indians crumbled to 58 all out.\nTrailing by 324, the Indians had to climb a mountain to evade a huge innings defeat, but were unable to do so, as none of their batsmen except Chandu Sarwate, offered any resistance. Sarwate, batted for two hours and forty minutes-160 minutes, to graft a determined 26. However, the other Indians again crumbled in the face of some quality pace, again, by Toshack himself (he took 6 wickets for 29 runs), and collapsed to be 98 all out, thus, Australia wrapped up the match, inflicting an innings-and-226-runs drubbing on the Indians. This defeat, Wisden noted could have been confidence-sapping for the Indians.\n2nd Test.\nMatch Background\nThis match was marred by rain, as only ten hours of play was possible in six days of play, out of which three days' worth of play was washed out, literally. The rain-affected \"sticky dog\" of a pitch proved terrible for batting, with none of the two teams managing even a score of 200. The Indian team squad changed slightly, fielding two debutants, Dattu Phadkar and Amir Elahi, replacing KM Rangnekar and Ranga Sohoni, the former going on to make an impressive debut. Australia missed Ernie Toshack due to injury, and this might have made a difference, since Toshack exploited the rain-affected pitch in the first match and could have done so this time around, had he played. However, this match is best remembered for the infamous \"Mankading\" incident, in which the Indian bowler, Vinoo Mankad ran out the Australian batsman Bill Brown for backing up too far, despite being warned in the first test.\nHowever, Don Bradman, Bill Brown's captain, defended Mankad's sportsmanship in his autobiography, saying,\n\"For the life of me, I can't understand why [the press] questioned his sportsmanship. The laws of cricket make it quite clear that the non-striker must keep within his ground until the ball has been delivered. If not, why is the provision there which enables the bowler to run him out? By backing up too far or too early, the non-striker is very obviously gaining an unfair advantage.\"\nMatch Report\nIndia won the toss this time around, choosing to bat first, and immediately, Australia drew first blood, taking the first wicket of Sarwate while the score was 2, and then the second wicket-this time Mankad, fell at 16. Then after 22 more runs were added, rain interrupted the proceedings, bringing a close to the day's play. The second day started an hour late, but the Indian batsmen were again facing the brunt of a menacing Australian attack, and could not stitch vital partnerships, except for a noteworthy partnership of 70 between Gogumal Kishenchand, and the debutant Phadkar. Eventually, the Indians folded up for 188.\nWhen it was the Australians' turn to bat, the opening pair of Brown and Morris put on a stand of 25, before Brown got Mankaded (Note that the scorecard lists all the victims of mankading as being run out). The third and fourth days' play was washed out, and on the fifth day, the saturated pitch did not help the batsmen much, as Phadkar and Vijay Hazare made most of the conditions, with Hazare scalping Bradman. Phadkar returned with thrifty figures of 3/14 and Hazare's analysis read 4/29 and Australia's innings wrapped up at 107. However, the Australian captain claimed that, \"The Indians dismissed us too quickly for their own good. They, in turn, had to now face the unpleasant wicket and were immediately in trouble, losing seven wickets for 61 before stumps.\"\nAt the end of the fifth day, the Australian bowlers, Bill Johnston and Ian Johnson showed that they could exploit the conditions just as well, reducing the Indians to seven down; but with a lead of 142, which was a high target on this wicket, the match seemed set for a thrilling finish. However, rain on the final day dispelled any chances of play.\n3rd Test.\nMatch Report\nThe match scheduled to be held in Melbourne was held almost two weeks after the second test in Sydney, was held and the Indians had already shown some fight in the second match and so they did in the third, albeit in the first innings only. The match started off with the Australians winning the toss and choosing to bat first. Immediately, the Indians got a breakthrough in the form of Barnes' wicket, bowled by Mankad with the score on 29. Then, Arthur Morris, and Don Bradman staged a fightback by stitching together a 70-run partnership, before Morris was bowled by Amarnath for a patient 45 crafted from 123 balls with three fours. Lindsay Hassett entered the fray with the score poised on 99, with his captain, Bradman batting. Hassett was dropped in the slips off Vijay Hazare's bowling when he was batting on 31. This lapse proved too costly for the Indians, because Hassett and Bradman staged a counterattack on the Indian bowlers with some fast scoring, Wisden's own words, Hassett was \"scored as fast as his partner\", and that, \"...at times runs came at two a minute\". Hassett's was the third wicket to fall, with the scorecard reading 268, gifting Mankad his second scalp. Then Bradman fell to Phadkar, for 132 scored only off 204 balls at a strike-rate excess of 60. After his dismissal, the wickets were easy to come by, with the last six falling for a mere 105.\nThe Indians stated their first innings well, with Mankad and Sarwate putting on 124 for the first wicket, before the latter became the first wicket to fall for 36 scored from 84 balls, dismissed by Bill Johnston. Then the next wicket fell at 145, this time it being that of Gul Mohammad, who was caught and bowled by Bruce Dooland, for 12. Mankad and Hazare contributed a stand of 43 before Hazare was dismissed by Sid Barnes. The next ball afterward, the Indian Captain, Amarnath fell for a duck getting out lbw to Barnes, who got his second wicket. The fifth wicket to fall, at 198, was that of Mankad himself, who had contributed a 116, which created history because it was India's first test century against Australia. He was caught by Don Tallon, the wicketkeeper, off Bill Johnston's bowling for a fine 116. Then Adhikari and Phadkar put up a partnership of 62 to bring some respectability to the score before Adhikari was dismissed for 24. Overnight rain made batting difficult, and after three cheap wickets, Amarnath declared even though India were 103 runs behind. To counter the difficult conditions, Bradman sent his tailenders, Dooland, Johnson and Johnston. But when Sid Barnes fell with the score on 32, Wisden noted that Bradman might have felt worried.\nHowever, there was no reason for him to worry, because he and Morris thoroughly \"mastered\" the attack. They strung together an unbeaten partnership of 223, and while Morris scored at a strike rate of less than 50, Bradman was all speed. He reached his century first and ended up on 127 not out, made only off 169 balls, with a strike rate of more than 75. This meant that for the first time ever in his largely impressive career which had seen him accumulate big numbers, he had scored two centuries in a single test match. Wisden spoke thus:\nHeavy overnight rain made the pitch responsive to spin and Bradman seizing this opportunity, declared, setting the Indians a target of 337. The Indians fared poorly in the second innings, with only Gul Mohammad and Kanwar Rai Singh making any noteworthy contributions, scoring 28 and 24. Singh stuck around giving a few lust hits here and there, but unfortunately for India, they folded up at 125, a score which seemed probable when they lost half of their side with just 60 runs on the board. Noteworthy performers for Australia were Bradman, Morris, Johnston, Johnson and Hassett. The Indians had some good individual performances in the form of Mankad and Amarnath, the former putting up a good all-round show, while the latter, picking up a match haul of 7 for 130.\n4th Test.\nMatch Report\nAfter being defeated by a heavy margin of 223 runs and an innings pasting, India still had a chance of winning the remaining two tests to avoid a series defeat, but that was too much to ask against the Invincibles, who were the better team in all respects. This test was the debut test of future Australian great, Neil Harvey. The toss was won by the Australians and on a pitch that was perfectly conductive for batting, Bradman chose to bat first.\nThe other Australian centurion in the previous match, Morris, was the first wicket to fall, bowled by Phadkar when the scorecard read 20. After that, his opening partner, Sid Barnes, and Bradman did not give the Indians a chance and controlled the proceedings from then, putting on 236 runs for the second wicket before Barnes perished for a \"faultless\" 112. He had not offered a single chance in his entire innings except when on 61, dropped by second slip. Bradman was once again the bane of the Indian bowlers, and he, along with Hassett, the next batsman (who had, incidentally put on another huge partnership with Bradman in the previous test) added 105 runs for the third wicket before Bradman fell to Hazare, for the second time in his test-career, for a masterful and dominant 201 which contained a six and 21 fours. Hassett, and Keith Miller added 142 runs more to the score, by hitting aggressively and freely. During their dominant and fast scoring spree, Hassett, quickly scoured past his highest score of 128 and was well on his way to an excellent and combative 198 before he ran out of partners. The rest of the batting order made 171 runs more for the loss of 6 wickets after Miller's dismissal for the fourth wicket. Australia were finally all out for 674, their highest total in the series.\nWhen it was the Indians' turn to bat, they made a shocking start to their innings, losing two wickets for just six runs, but they fought back well from that perilous position, to add 127 more runs, albeit at the cost of three wickets. Their overall position, 5 for 133, was not too encouraging, but Vijay Hazare and Dattu Phadkar added 188 runs for the sixth wicket. Phadkar contributed a fine 123 against an Australian attack that had Lindwall Miller, Johnson and Johnston among others. However, the man who was the centre of attraction was Hazare, who cracked a classical and orthodox 116 to provide some resistance before the Indian lower-order crumpled, as their last four batsmen totalled only 20 runs. The only other Indian batsmen who really made any impact were Vinoo Mankad, who made 156-ball 49, which spanned 139 minutes-2 hours and 19 minutes, and Lala Amarnath, who hit a fast, 46, only off 47 balls, which had five hits to the fence. However, India succumbed to a strong Australian attack, which bowled them out for 381 – 293 runs behind. It was a staggering margin of lead and victories after follow-on were rare. The Indians started even worse this time around, losing two wickets quickly for no runs on the board. It was then that Hazare played an innings which made a contemporary daily speak thus:\nIn fact, the innings was so widely acclaimed that everything else was overshadowed, even Bradman's 201. Hazare later came to recall in an interview that his two centuries in the test were the second most prominent memories of the tour after his wicket of Bradman's in the rain-marred, low scoring Sydney test.\nIn another interview with Boria Majumdar in October, noted cricket historian, Hazare claimed that:\nThis was an incredible feat, considering that Australia's bowling attack was almost as good as its batting. Their bowling-lineup boasted of some stellar names: Keith Miller, who was a genuine allrounder capable of giving very good performances with both bat and the ball, Ray Lindwall, who was said to possess absolute mastery of bowling in any condition, an who was bowling accurately, with penetrative and attacking bowling, and Ian Johnson and Bill Johnston, who were both equally vital cogs in the team. This particular innings of Hazare's was said to have enhanced India's reputation as well as his. In the process, Hazare emulated Bradman, who did the same in the previous test.\nHis effort was backed up by Hemu Adhikari's first half-century of the series, 51. Adhikari lent Hazare valuable support and the two batsmen added 132 runs, but the end came soon enough when the Indian tailenders succumbed to Lindwall's pace, as the last three wickets fell for six runs. Australia inflicted another innings defeat to seal a well-deserved series win, but Hazare emerged with his head held high due to his personal triumph. However, the Australian team was too good for the Indians.\n5th Test.\nMatch report\nThe fifth and the final test match was a dead rubber, ultimately, and this match began with one final opportunity for the Indian team to translate their individual performances into solid teamwork. The Australians on the other hand, had already won two successive matches against the tourists and their team had also gelled as one unit. Not only did their captain, Bradman lead with example, but the other team members also proved themselves equally adept. So this match saw the Indians playing with their honour at stake.\nBradman's luck with the coin toss continued in the series, as he won the toss and chose to bat first for the fourth occasion out of five. The Australian openers put on 48 runs before Sid Barnes was run out brilliantly by Adhikari. As usual, Bradman came out to bat at one-down and along with Bill Brown, he added 92 runs for the third wicket before something unfortunate for Australia happened. Bradman discovered that he had torn a rib muscle and was unable to play freely, so he retired hurt at 140/1. Brown was unaffected by this situation and carved a three-hour, twenty-five-minute 99, from 216 balls. Again he too was run out, but the other Australian batsmen scored handily. Sam Loxton, making his debut, scored a 155-ball 80, Lindwall, Tallon(the wicket-keeper), Len Johnson, and Bill Johnston contributed to the huge scoreline.\nHowever, the chief honours went to the nineteen-year, four-month old Neil Harvey, who muscled a powerful 153, with one five and eleven fours. He ended the first day on 78, and then hit his century on 7 February 1948. He had been promoted to no.5 in the match and it was effectively a just reward for his promotion. He surpassed Archie Jackson's record of being the youngest centurion for Australia, a record that still stands. His innings was absolutely flawless except for a chance which he gave the Indian fielders shortly before he was dismissed.\nSarwate fell for the first wicket at 3/1 when the Indians began to bat. However, Mankad and Adhikari batted well to bail India out of the crisis, adding 124 for the second wicket before Adhikari fell for 38, made from 202 balls with a solitary boundary. Fresh from his previous match heroics, Hazare came out to bat with Mankad and they put on 79 before Mankad fell for his second century of the series, a well-crafted, five-hour 111. Then Hazare fell for the fifth wicket after a fine 74. The other batsmen except for Phadkar, who made 56 not out, did not survive much longer, as India's batting yet again folded up for a limp display after a strong revival by Hazare and Mankad. Ultimately, India followed on by 244 runs and this time, in their second innings neither Mankad nor Hazare could save their necks as their batting put up a weak performance to be all out for 67. Adhikari top-scored with 17, but other than his \"resistance\", no other Indian batsmen quite managed to occupy the crease and grind out a draw. The two Australian debutants, Doug Ring and Len Johnson had a field day, picking up twelve wickets between them. While Johnson took 6/74, including 3/8 in the second innings, Ring took 6/120. Johnson went on to play only one more test after that, while Ring went on to become a useful allrounder for the Australian team. This capped a miserable tour for the Indian team, who could, \"with reason, complain of ill-fortune in most of the matches.\"\nThe Tour.\nThis tour can best be remembered for being India's first tour to Australia and also for being Bradman's last test series at home and his second last series. It was perhaps because of this that it was assumed that the Indians were actually keen to watch Bradman play. Even though India capitulated for scores less than hundred four times on the tour, their batsmen performed well individually. In fact, Dattu Phadkar, who cracked a century in fourth test, and hit three fifties as well, headed the averages. Vijay Hazare became a sensation after his two centuries in the same match. Vinoo Mankad hit two centuries, in the third and fifth tests, however, it was the failure from an experienced campaigner and their team captain Lala Amarnath, which hastened the team's heavy loss.\nOn paper, it was a strong Indian team which included the likes of Mankad, Hazare, Amarnath and CS Nayudu. But these players never performed collectively, which was what the Australians did. Don Bradman accumulated runs better than before, and his average in this series of 178.75 was nearly the double of his career average. He was the series' top run-scorer. While ray Lindwall, was the series' highest wicket-taker with 18 wickets. For India, Vijay Hazare scored 429 runs and Lala Amarnath took 13 wickets from six innings. However, Amarnath's string of poor scores with the bat cost India the services of another specialist batsman, who could have at least reduced the margins of defeat.\nThe Australians, on the other hand coordinated perfectly as a unit: their batsmen piled up big scores and their bowlers ran through the Indian lineup, evident by the fact that the Indians never scored more than 400 in the whole test series.\nMoreover, the series also magnified the deficit of a strike bowler in India who could take wickets regularly and could contain the run-flow. Don Bradman noted:\nIt was of the opinion that this side was one of India's strongest to play, but Rusi Modi, Vijay Merchant, Mushtaq Ali and Fazal Mahmood all missed the tour, which crippled India, because Modi and Merchant were India's most reliable batsmen on all types of pitches and surfaces. They also lost a strike bowler, which Fazal Mahmood would go on to become for Pakistan.\nAmarnath's lack of success with the bat (140 runs at 14.00 in 10 innings) was an aberration from his performances in the tour, where he scored 1162 runs at an average of 58.10, and picked up 30 wickets. The 228 he made against Victoria in the tour matches was described as \"one of the greatest ever played\" in Australia, by a recognized member of Bill Woodfull's 1932 Bodyline side, Victor Richardson. His captaincy was also said to have been criticised for the frequent changes he made in the batting order, but all the players were reported to have unanimously agreed that his management was fine. Bradman also had written thus of his captaincy, describing an incident when he was playing for the Australian XI side against India in the first-class matches, when he was batting on 99, and Amarnath brought on Gogumal Kishenchand to bowl.\nHazare, Mankad and Phadkar were given praises by Wisden. Wisden asserted that Mankad proved his credentials as the best allrounder of his generation. His left-arm spin brought him 61 wickets on the tour. Hazare's achievement of hitting two back-to-back centuries in the Adelaide test was describe as the series' best performances. He was only the second Indian to score 1000 runs on the tour. Dattu Phadkar was hailed as being the \"fastest\" Indian bowler. But his achievement of topping the averages for India with 52.33 was mentioned as being a \"welcome surprise\". His 123 in the fourth test was described as a capital century.\nThis series was also one in the line of many memorable tests between India and Australia."

They played 8 One Day Internationals as part of the Carlton &amp; United Series against Pakistan and Australia.\nPakistan and Australia reached the 2 game final which was won by Australia.\nBackground.\nThe Indian team left for Australia on 22 November 1999 from Mumbai. Arriving in Australia, India had a record of 3 wins and 16 losses in the 25 Tests played in the country over 50 years and six tours. The last tour of 1991–92, that included a five-match Test series, had ended in a 4–0 loss. India's captain Sachin Tendulkar expected his team to \"do well\" in the tour ahead of arrival. But Mohammad Azharuddin Match fixing allegations &amp; calls for his subsequent life ban from International Cricket rocked India in 1999. Going into the Test series with former stats, won only one away Test since 1986 &amp; the Azhar scandal, India was indeed in a spot of boiler. Mohammad Azharuddin was not included in the squad which weakened Indian batting unit heavily. In preparation for the tour, India rested Anil Kumble, Javagal Srinath, and Venkatesh Prasad, three of its frontline bowlers, for the last two ODIs against New Zealand, of the home series prior to the tour, before Srinath was called up to replace an injured Ajay Jadeja in the final game. Dr Bhargava of the Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association was appointed the team's manager for the tour.\nAustralia entered the series on the back of a 3–0 series win at home against Pakistan. They were also expected to beat India 3–0 while some predicted a 2–0 result in their favour. The former got consolidated after India's loss in the first-class tour game against Queensland. Beginning the tour, India were placed fifth in the ICC Test rankings.\nSquads.\nThe BCCI announced a 16-man India squad for the tour on 1 November. Sunil Joshi was the only regular member of the team left out. The Indian selectors received criticism for the exclusion of Mohammad Azharuddin and the inclusion of Ajay Jadeja and Ajit Agarkar from the squad that was justified by Chandu Borde, the chairman of selectors, citing Match fixing allegations on Azharuddin &amp; emphasizing on the fact of having chosen a squad of \"young blood\" and with \"focus ... on youth.\" Later, Jadeja, who had torn a rotator cuff of his right shoulder on 10 November, a day prior to an ODI against New Zealand, was ruled out and Hrishikesh Kanitkar was named as his replacement, who was picked over Nayan Mongia and Jacob Martin. The Australia squad for the first Test was announced on 6 December. For the second Test, Colin Miller was replaced by Brett Lee.\nTour matches.\nFour-day: Queensland v Indians.\nThe Indians lost their first wicket in Devang Gandhi for no score after having been put in to bat by Queensland captain Stuart Law after winning the toss. Sadagoppan Ramesh followed Gandhi after a 100-run stand for the second wicket with VVS Laxman, with the latter then putting on 136 runs with captain Sachin Tendulkar (83) for the fourth wicket. Laxman brought up his century in 200 balls, striking three consecutive fours off Matthew Anderson when he was on 95. He was dismissed by Scott Muller when on 113, before the lower order fell cheaply, and going to stumps at 273/9. The final wicket fell on the third ball the following morning after 4 runs were added to the total. Queensland got off to a decent start before Jimmy Maher (10) was trapped lbw by Debashish Mohanty following an economical spell from him and Venkatesh Prasad. Matthew Hayden, the other opener, lost his wicket after making 44, that included 6 fours and a six. Law followed him after being run out for a duck with the score at 91/3. His departure brought Andrew Symonds to the crease who, with Martin Love put on 204 runs for the fourth wicket, in just 40 overs, both scoring centuries. Symonds fell in the penultimate over of the day after making 161 off 174 deliveries, an innings that included 26 fours and a six. His team finished the day at 363/7, with a lead of 86 runs.\nThe Indians' second innings began after bowling Queensland out for 401, and trailing by 124 runs, on the third morning. Laxman (73) put on 85 runs with Rahul Dravid (42) before both were dismissed and only Tendulkar (27) offering any further resistance. Anderson removed the tail and finished with figures of 4/50, with the Indians finishing at 204. Queensland reached the target of 81 runs in 95 minutes on the fourth and final morning with openers Law and Maher remaining unbeaten on 60 and 20, winning the match by 10 wickets.\nFour-day: New South Wales v Indians.\nThe Indians won the toss and elected to bat first, who were led by Sourav Ganguly while Tendulkar rested. The New South Wales rested their four Test players. Batting on an uneven pitch, the Indians were dismissed for 185. Ganguly top-scored with 38 while Brett Lee picked three wickets for 56 runs. The New South Wales went to stumps having lost one wicket, in the second over. The Indians picked up four wickets before lunch on day two reducing the New South Wales to 135/5, who were dismissed for 231, after the lower order added 96 runs in 90 minutes, securing a lead of 46 runs. Brad Haddin top-scored with 60 while Anil Kumble returned with figures of 4/50 for the Indians. The day ended with the Indians at 110/2; Sadagoppan Ramesh batting on 70. They went to lunch on day 3 at 178/5 before Ganguly (81) fell as he nicked a Don Nash delivery to the wicket-keeper. At tea, they were 279/5 having scored over 100 runs in the session, before Ajit Agarkar (65*) carried the lower order to a total of 331, setting the New South Wales a target of 286. Lee was the most successful of the bowlers again, with figures of 4/77, and Stuart MacGill with 4/84.\nIn reply, New South Wales started off strongly and went to stumps needing 222 runs to win with nine wickets in hand. The day was marked by a controversy after the on-field umpires ruled two decisions in the favour of the New South Wales, that led to the Indians not \"getting on with the game\", against who the former lodged a report with the match referee. The New South Wales began slowly on the fourth and final morning playing under overcast and humid conditions scoring just 42 runs in the first two hours and having lost one wicket. Opener Greg Hayne reached his maiden half-century from his 85th delivery and carried on while wickets kept falling at the other end in regular intervals. The Indians struck hard in the post lunch session reducing the New South Wales to 171/7 at tea; Hayne top-scoring with 89. The tail was dismissed cheaply by Kumble, who finished with 4/38, with the opposing team falling short of 93 runs from the target.\n50-over: Prime Minister's XI v Indians.\nShane Lee led the young Prime Minister's XI side in Simon Katich's absence due to illness, while Sachin Tendulkar returned to lead the Indians. The prime Minister's XI included Graeme Cunningham who was yet to play a first-class match till then. Winning the toss, Tendulkar opted to field on batsman-friendly conditions, and played a depleted bowling attack in the absence of Venkatesh Prasad, Javagal Srinath and Anil Kumble. The openers for the Prime Minister's XI began strongly scoring 10 runs off the first over. After the first wicket fell, David Fitzgerald and Andrew Symonds went on to score centuries; both resorting to power-hitting, also surviving multiple dismissal attempts through their innings. Chasing a target of 332, the Indians started off poorly losing both openers inside three overs. Ganguly (46) and Hrishikesh Kanitkar (45) put on 78 runs for the sixth wicket, however carried no momentum before the last five wickets fell for 48 runs. Brett Lee returned with the best figures for his team (4/25).\nFour-day: Tasmania v Indians.\nRahul Dravid of the Indians found form after a hitherto ordinary tour, upon his captain Ganguly won the toss and opted to bat first. His 107 included over a 114-run partnership with Hrishikesh Kanitkar who made a half-century, with the two batting for over three hours. Vijay Bharadwaj then added 58 runs with Dravid before both and VVS Laxman were dismissed in a span of 4.3 overs and 8 runs. The Indians ended the day's plat at 241/6. Upon resumption, they declared at lunch with the score at 269/9; the tail putting on an unbroken 47-run partnership. Andrew Downton finished with figures of 5/90, the best for Tasmania. In reply, Tasmania began strongly and went to stumps at 166/0, with the openers batting for over the fours hours on a slow pitch on day two, and none of the six bowlers for the Indians providing any breakthrough. At 88 overnight, captain Jamie Cox completed his century, his 24th in first-class cricket, the following morning before being dismissed for 139, while Dene Hills made 84. Daniel Marsh and Andrew Dykes then put on 104 runs for the fourth wicket, before Dykes' dismissal for 61 while Marsh batted on building another partnership, of 91 runs, with Shaun Young in the cold and windy conditions. Marsh went to stumps having faced 156 deliveries for his 118, with his team at having secured a lead of 156 runs. 20 minutes into the final morning, he reached his highest first-class score before being dismissed for 157, with his team declaring the innings at 548/5. The match ended in a draw by mutual consent after the Indians finished at 130/3; Laxman top-scoring for them (58).\nTest series.\nThird Test.\nThe third and last test was the New Year's test, played at Sydney. Sachin Tendulkar won the toss for India and elected to bat first. Only 60 overs were bowled on the first day, but India had collapsed to 8–121 at the end. Sachin Tendulkar (45) was the only batsman to cross forty. The Indian innings folded quickly on the second day for 150. Australia started badly, going to 1–9 and later to 2–49 before Justin Langer and Ricky Ponting, who scored 223 and 141* respectively, took them past 450. An unbeaten cameo of 45 from Gilchrist took them to 5–552, and Australia declared their innings closed.\nIndia needed to cross 400 runs in the second innings just to make Australia bat again, which they had not scored even once in the entire series. But VVS Laxman seemed to have found the form that had eluded him the entire series. The complete range of cricket strokes was on display as Laxman flew to 167 in just 198 balls, being particularly savage on Brett Lee (taking 52 runs off 5 overs at one point) and Shane Warne. The rest of the Indian batting, however, could not stand up to the accuracy of Glenn McGrath as he took five wickets to go with the fifer in the first innings. He was declared Man of the Match, as Australia won by an innings and 141 runs."

        "text": "The New Zealand national cricket team toured Australia in the 1993–94 season to play in three test matches against Australia before playing in a tri-series with South Africa. The tour began on October 19, in Perth, Western Australia, against an Australian Chairman XI as they played in five warm-up matches before the test matches in Perth, Hobart and Brisbane. New Zealand were captained by Martin Crowe while the Australians were captain by Allan Border.\nBefore the first test, the tourists played in five tour matches, three first-class and two list A matches. In the first test which was played at the WACA Ground, centuries from Ian Healy, Mark Taylor and Andrew Jones would see the match end in a draw. New Zealand than suffering their biggest innings defeat in their history in the second test held at the Bellerive Oval. After Australia had scored 6/544, New Zealand was bowled out for 161 in both innings to lose by an innings and 222 runs. The final test match held at the Brisbane Cricket Ground saw the same result with Australia winning by an innings to take out the Trans-Tasman Trophy 2–0. Kiwi batsman, Andrew Jones was the top run-scorer of the series with 324 runs while Shane Warne was the leading wicket-taker in the series with 18 wickets.\nBackground.\nHeading into the tour, the Australians had previously head over to England for the 1993 Ashes Series as they won the series 4–1 which saw the batting of David Boon, Mark Waugh, Allan Border all scoring over 430 runs throughout the test series. Another critical factor for Australia was Shane Warne who claimed 34 wickets throughout the series as he was aided by Merv Hughes (31 wickets) who wouldn't be selected for the test series against New Zealand. New Zealand's last series was against Australia at home when they tied the series in the tests before only just losing the ODI Series 3–2.\nSquads.\nOn the 27 October 1993, David White was selected to fly into Australia as a backup to Mark Greatbatch who was carrying an injury leading into the test series. The first test squad for Australia was revealed on the 9 November, with a call-up to debutant Glenn McGrath who had only played eight first-class matches for New South Wales. After the first test match, Martin Crowe returned home after an injury to his left knee. Ken Rutherford would replace Crowe as the captain for New Zealand in the remaining two tests.\nTour matches.\nNew Zealand vs. ACB Chairman XI.\nThe opening tour match for New Zealand took place at the Lilac Hill in Perth against a ACB Chairman XI which featured Jeff Thomson, Dennis Lillee and Richard Hadlee who were all over forty years old. After forcing New Zealand to be 8/91 at one stage, a ninth wicket partnership between Blair Pocock and Willie Watson rescued New Zealand to a score of 189. In the run-chase, Damien Martyn top scored with 81 as he got the man of the match award as he led the Chairman team to a six wicket victory.\nNew Zealand vs. Western Australia.\nNew Zealand stayed in Perth to play their second warm-up against a Western Australia side. Batting first, New Zealand was bowled out for 149 with Western Australian bowler, Jo Angel taking five wickets for 32. In response, Western Australia scored 508 with an partnership of 185 runs from test-fringe hopefuls, Damien Martyn (80) and Tom Moody (110) being completed in only 214 minutes. Tim Zoehrer also chipped in with a solid 83 as he pushed the total past 500. In the second innings, half-centuries from Andrew Jones, Ken Rutherford and Dipak Patel got New Zealand to 350 with Jo Angel taking another five wickets as Western Australia won by an innings and nine runs. The match though would see Justin Langer fined $300 for refusing to walk after being dismissed with Martin Crowe doing a similar response the following day.\nNew Zealand vs. AIS Cricket Academy XI.\nNew Zealand headed over to North Sydney Oval to take on an Cricket Academy XI which featured Glenn McGrath who would go on to play in his first test later in the tour. For the tourists, they would have their third loss of the tour with only a Tony Blain 40 resembling some fight in the 110 run defeat. Chris Cairns being the best New Zealand bowler with 4/39.\nNew Zealand vs. New South Wales.\nTwo days later, New Zealand took on New South Wales in a four-day first-class match played at the No. 1 Sports Ground in Newcastle. The opening day of the tour match saw an partnership of 119 between Mark Waugh (63) and Steve Waugh (88) before Dipak Patel brought the game back with 6/87 from 23 consecutive overs to bring New South Wales from 3/218 to declare at 8/299. New Zealand first innings didn't get going with Martin Crowe maintaining his bad form as he scored 12 runs in his innings. Eventually an 65 run innings from Ken Rutherford pushed New Zealand to 163 in their first innings. With a target of 246 runs for victory after New South Wales collapsed for 109 in the second innings, New Zealand chased down the target with three wickets to spare with Danny Morrison and Tony Blain contributing the remaining runs on the fourth day.\nNew Zealand vs. Tasmania.\nThe final tour match before the first test saw New Zealand head down to Launceston for a four-day game against Tasmania at the NTCA Ground. After New Zealand won the toss and elected to field, Tasmanian batsman David Boon only lasted ten minutes in his first match of the season. The contribution was shared between the Tasmanian batsman with batsman getting starts before getting out. Only Shaun Young and Mark Atkinson contributed half-centuries while Chris Cairns took five wickets. New Zealand responded with 7/215 before declaring as Andrew Jones top-scored with 67 before running himself out late in the second day. This was followed up by another declaration from Tasmania in their second innings with Ricky Ponting top-scoring for Tasmania with 54 as David Boon only scored 21 as he was out early in his innings. Chasing 299 for victory, Martin Crowe was dropped twice (on 17 and 46) as he went on to score his 53rd century and his first of the tour as he top scored with 105. But the match would end in a draw with New Zealand scoring 7/247 with Troy Cooley being the pick of the bowlers with two wickets.\nNew Zealand vs. South Australia.\nDuring the break between the first and second test, New Zealand played in a four day practice match against a South Australia eleven at Adelaide Oval. Despite winning the toss, the South Australia were bowled out for 158 with Doull claiming six wickets. In response, they declared on 6/276 with Damion Reevees being the pick of the bowlers with 4/62 with leg-spinner Peter McIntyre not bowling after chipping his right forefinger while batting. After the New Zealand innings was closed during Day 3, South Australia reached 9/260 with James Brayshaw top scoring with 94 in the innings which took four hours in what \"The Age\" called it the 'blandest 247' at the end of Day 3. New Zealand would go on to chase down the target of 144 that was set which was set by a 131 run opening stand between Greatbatch (64) and Pocock (60). This was despite South Australia taking three late wickets for only four runs with Patel securing the victory with a single.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nHeading into the first test, Mark Greatbatch was brought back into the test side after damaging his finger earlier in the tour as David White went home due to a torn knee cartilage from the match against Tasmania. New Zealand coach stated before the match \"For Australia, the Ashes tour of England is the big tour; this is the equivalent of an Ashes tour for us.\" The first test saw two players made their test debutant with Kiwi batsman, Blair Pocock opening the batting while Glenn McGrath debut for Australia.\nThe match started two hours later than the schedule time after overnight rain vividly made the pitch greener as the curators prolong the close-mowing to remove the green smear that was on the pitch. Selecting to bowl first, Cairns rifled the Australian batsman with his first delivery striking Michael Slater in the midriff because taking the wicket of Slater and in the next ball, Boon to put Australia 2/37. After preventing the hat-trick, Steve Waugh with opening batsman Mark Taylor (who would go on to make 63) dug in to bring the score up to 100 as the Australians would make 6/229 at the end of stumps which was drawn an hour late. The following day, Ian Healy recorded his second century of his test career which after the end of the day, he stated, \"It was a little gesture to my father, Neville, whose father passed away yesterday,\". He was guided by some late order hitting from Paul Reiffel (51) and Craig McDermott (35) as he guided Australia to 398 from the position of 6/198 at one stage.\nMcGrath recorded his first test wicket with his 27th ball as New Zealand loss Mark Greatbach for 18. Blair Pocock was the next to fall on 34 with Jones ending the day on 62* with New Zealand being at 2/123 at stumps. Jones would go on to score 143 before being dismissed by Mark Waugh caught behind. Cairns also contributed to the bat with 66 (would go on to reach 78) which included a six over mid-off from Shane Warne's bowling in what was his highest test score. Ken Rutherford (17) though would contribute to being Craig McDermott's 200th wicket. The fourth day would see New Zealand declare on 9/419 with Watson tearing a hamstring while running for a single which prevented him from bowling the rest of the match.\nAustralia's second innings saw the team only lose one wicket through the entire innings with the wicket of Michael Slater falling on 99 after he feathered a delivery from Patel into the gloves of Patel. A century from Mark Taylor saw Australia declare on 1/323 from their 87 overs with Greg Baum from \"The Age\" stating that they batted on for at least half an hour too long. This forced the match into a draw with New Zealand only getting to 166 before the match was declared a draw. For Crowe it was his last match of the tour with the pain in his left knee being more intolerable throughout the test match as he missed the remaining two test matches with Rutherford becoming captain.\n2nd Test.\nLeading into the test, Australia made one change to their eleven with Glenn McGrath being dropped for Tim May. For New Zealand, they made two changes with Richard de Groen appearing in his first test with Chris Harris replacing Crowe due to injury. Batting first, the Australians dominated the opening day of the test as New Zealand had five missed chances for only two wickets in return. For Australia, Slater's footwork was nimble and after almost a run-out on 99, lead the batting with 168 run innings. David Boon recorded his 18th century with the television stations not automatically switching over to the news as it took him seven minutes to go from 99 to 100. He would only score one more run on the second day with Australia eventually declaring on 6/544 with Mark Waugh becoming the third Australian in the innings to get a century as he made 111 runs over 139 balls. Only Richard de Groen took more than one wicket in the Australian innings, getting Mark Waugh and Healy out.\nWith the winds swirling on the Derwent, Australia dropped three catches with Healy, Boon and Warne all dropping catches at certain intervals with New Zealand ending the second day on 2/81. Disaster though would strike on the third day for New Zealand as they collapsed, losing eight wickets for only 80 runs to be bowled out for 161. Tim May taking a five wicket haul for the Aussies as Shane Warne broke the spin-bowling record for a calendar year with 59 wickets. Only Andrew Jones and Tony Blain mustered any residence to the spin bowling of May and Warne. New Zealand was force to follow-on and by the end of the day finished on 5/127 with Ken Ruthford scoring a half-century before being bowled by Warne. The match would end before lunch on Day 4 with Warne taking four wickets while only conceding three runs as he finished with figures of 6/31 as New Zealand was bowled out for 161. For New Zealand this was their heaviest defeat with the previous record being in the 1962-63 tour against England where they lost by 215 runs.\n3rd Test.\nLeading into the third test which was played at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, Chris Cairns stress fracture was cleared with New Zealand coach, Geoff Howarth and captain Rutherford wanting Cairns to play as a batsman but refused that offer. He replaced Chris Harris in the side, while Bryan Young (who replaced Murphy Su'a) was picked to make his test debut despite having four ducks in the tour matches before the test. For Australia, they only made the one change with Glenn McGrath coming in for Paul Reiffel.\nBatting first on a pitch manufactured of batsman, New Zealand collapsed from a good position (3/167) to losing 6/26 in eighty minutes to be 9/193 as they finished the opening day on 9/208. The main culprits of the collapse being Shane Warne and Craig McDermott who each got three and four wickets respectively in the innings. For New Zealand, Andrew Jones top scored with 56 which included a partnership of 94 with debutant Young scoring 38. After bowling out New Zealand for 233 early on the second day, Australia would round up with 3/241 with the partnership between David Boon and Mark Waugh hitting another century partnership. Their sixth for the 1993 calendar year. The following day, centuries from Steve Waugh (147*) and Allan Border (105) who was playing in his 150th test built a partnership of 159. This partnership aid in getting Australia to declare on 6/607 early on the fourth day. Only Simon Doull took multiple wickets in the innings with 2/105 from 33 overs.\nChasing 374 to force Australia to bat again, New Zealand could only score 278 in their second innings with the match being played into a fifth day after showers affected the fourth day before the day was abandoned by the umpires. Ken Rutherford top scored for New Zealand with 56 while Shane Warne took four wickets as he not only claimed the man of the match but also man of the series with his 18 wickets across the three tests.\nStatistics.\nAfter the three tests, Andrew Jones ended up with the most runs of the series with 324 runs from six innings. He was followed by the Australian trio of Slater, Taylor and Boon with Kiwi batsman, Ken Rutherford rounding out the top five. Shane Warne finished the series as the leading wicket taker with 18 wickets from three matches at an average of 16.94 runs per wicket. He was followed by his Australian teammates in McDermott, May, McGrath and Mark Waugh. The leading wicket taker for New Zealand was Chris Cairns who took five wickets.\nExternal sources.\nCricinfo"

        "text": "The New Zealand national cricket team toured Australia in the 2004–05 season and played 2 Test matches against Australia.\nTest series.\nAustralia won the Test series 2–0 with convincing wins in both matches.\nGlenn McGrath was named man of the series after hitting his first half century in the First Test and took 9 wickets over the two matches.\nOne Day Internationals.\nAustralia and New Zealand played an ODI series which ended 1–1 with one game abandoned due to rain. This was the inaugural Chappell–Hadlee Trophy.\nNew Zealand's victory at Melbourne was the first win by New Zealand against Australia in almost 3 years. The match at Brisbane was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to heavy rain, preventing the series decider from taking place.\n1st ODI.\nThe first match at Telstra Dome in Melbourne on 5 December was won by New Zealand and was considered a thrillingly close affair. After a decidedly unsuccessful Test series against Australia, a New Zealand victory was considered unlikely, with bookmakers odds heavily favouring the home side.\nAustralia began proceedings with opening partners Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden reaching 50 runs before the end of the seventh over. This partnership was ended in spectacular fashion, with Hayden attempting a strong pull shot which looked to be heading straight for the boundary. However, Mathew Sinclair, at full sprint and diving to his left, pulled off a marvellous wrong-handed catch which has been heralded as one of the best of the decade (competing with Australian Glenn McGrath's catch in the 2002–03 Ashes against England). Gilchrist put in a typical performance, making a quick 68 runs off only 54 balls, before being dispatched by an impressive Chris Cairns delivery which bowled him (a feat Cairns was later to repeat twice more, taking both Michael Clarke's and Brett Lee's wicket in the same manner). Cairns' insertion into the bowling attack sparked a collapse in the Australian middle order, which in the space of 18 balls lost 4 wickets for just 10 runs. The bowling of Cairns and Daniel Vettori wreaked havoc with the Australian batsmen, with personal figures of 3/39 and 3/31 respectively. Darren Lehmann second top-scored with 50 runs and he, together with the struggling efforts of the lower order batsmen, brought Australia to a respectable 9/246 after 50 overs.\nNew Zealand began the run chase in a tenuous fashion, losing the wicket of captain Stephen Fleming LBW for a duck after less than one minute. However, the 1/0 figure was in the next two hours to become 1/128, with opening batsman Nathan Astle and Mathew Sinclair's partnership proving to be formidable. Sinclair was then run out by Andrew Symonds, and Astle's wicket fell in the following over for 70 runs, which included a magnificent six. The breakthrough was consolidated with the loss of Scott Styris' wicket soon after for just 5 runs, but Hamish Marshall put up a performance of 50 not-out from 52 balls, and together with quick scores of 24 runs off 22 balls from Jacob Oram, 14 runs off 11 balls from Chris Cairns, and 20 not out off 13 balls from Brendon McCullum, helped New Zealand reach the target of 247 with just two balls left to be bowled.\nHamish Marshall's impressive and innovative innings of 50 not-out earned him man of the match.\n2nd ODI.\nThe second match at Sydney Cricket Ground on 8 December was won by Australia, and was similar to the first in that Australia set a competitive total and New Zealand put up a very good chase, making for another close finish.\nAdam Gilchrist opened in his usual quick-hitting style, making 60 runs from 48 balls, including nine fours and one six. At one stage, in the course of three overs, Gilchrist piled on 41 runs. His partner Hayden contributed one run during this time. Chris Cairns was brought into the attack to attempt to slow the run rate, but it took the bowling of Scott Styris to remove Gilchrist from the batting crease, caught by Nathan Astle. The new batsman Ricky Ponting with Hayden put together a useful partnership to be 1/140, before Ponting was dismissed after making 32. It was in Ponting's innings that New Zealand's veteran bowler Chris Harris, in saving four runs, dove to his left, landed awkwardly on his shoulder and tore his rotator cuff, in his 250th ODI. Ponting's dismissal proved to be the precursor to another middle order collapse for Australia, for Hayden was dismissed just a few minutes later for 43, and in even shorter order Damien Martyn was dismissed for 5 and Andrew Symonds for his second consecutive duck. Australia had lost four wickets for eight runs and looked to be in some bother, which was exacerbated five overs later with the loss of Michael Clarke for just six runs. At six wickets down though, Darren Lehmann and Brad Hogg steadied and put on a partnership of 74 runs before Darren Lehmann was run out with two overs remaining at 7/235. The incoming batsman Brett Lee put on 10 quick runs and Brad Hogg a further 16 to have Australia at 7/261 after 50 overs.\nThe New Zealand run chase was every bit as exciting as it had been in the first match. Nathan Astle followed up his 70 runs in the first match with just 11, beaten by the bowling of Australian speedster Brett Lee. Sinclair was the next to go, scoring 17 runs before edging a Jason Gillespie ball to Hayden in the slips. This was the beginning of a New Zealand collapse, with Scott Styris the next to depart with 5 runs, and then Stephen Fleming who had successfully taken on Lee, scoring 34 runs from 44 balls, falling to Brad Hogg's first delivery, given out LBW. Jacob Oram then fell for two runs, followed by Hamish Marshall for just 9, the latter falling victim to a quick ball from Lee which took his off stump.\nNew Zealand had lost five wickets for 23 runs, but a remarkable revival was to come, which perhaps would have won the match were it not for a dubious decision going against them.\nChris Cairns and Brendon McCullum found themselves in the precarious position of being at 6/86 after 22 overs, needing 262 for victory. Cairns hit fast and hard, knocking 50 runs from 40 balls, before falling victim to Gillespie's bowling, attempting another boundary. Three overs later, McCullum was the recipient of a ball from Brad Hogg which he attempted to block, getting a thick edge of his bat to the ball before it struck his pads. Upon appeal however, umpire Peter Parker gave McCullum out, a clearly incorrect decision.\nTwo bowlers, Kyle Mills and Daniel Vettori, were then the batsmen for New Zealand, and had the task of getting nearly 100 runs in less than 13 overs, with only the shoulder sling-sporting Chris Harris left to bat if either of them was dismissed. They took to this task with an amazing showcase of batting prowess, the likes of which would have been impressive for opening batsmen, let alone bottom-order batsmen.\nInitially, Vettori took control with competent batting and got to 27 runs at the beginning of the 42nd over, with Mills having taken a more passive role at 7 runs. This role was soon to be reversed. Mills hit four sixes in four consecutive balls, over the space of two overs, in a display considered to be worthy of any current top batsman. In the following over, now needing only a run per ball bowled, Vettori was run out by a direct throw from Ricky Ponting, to have New Zealand 9/236.\nChris Harris bravely took to the batting crease with a runner, Hamish Marshall. Looking ungainly and in considerable discomfort due to his previously incurred injury, he managed 4 runs from 6 balls before being beaten by a McGrath yorker which took his middle stump, leaving Mills at 44 not-out from 26 balls, and New Zealand all out for 244.\nBrad Hogg was named Man of the match.\n3rd ODI.\nThe third match at Brisbane Cricket Ground on 10 December, which was meant to be the series decider, was rained off, and the Trophy shared after a 1–1 series tie.\nDaniel Vettori was named Man of the Series after two impressive performances, with both the bat and the ball."

        "text": "The West Indies cricket team toured Australia in the 1951–52 season and played five Test matches against Australia. The series was billed as the \"World Championship of cricket\", with both teams having beaten England in the previous 18 months. In the event, the series was a disappointment with Australia winning fairly easily by four matches to one.\nAfter the Australian leg of the tour, the West Indies team moved on to New Zealand where the first Test matches between New Zealand and West Indies were played. See this article for further details.\nThe West Indies touring team.\nThe West Indies team was captained by John Goddard, who had led the side to series victories over India and England.\nThe full side was:\nAll of the players except Guillen and Marshall had played Test cricket before the tour, and the two exceptions made their debuts during the Australian leg of the tour.\nThe Test matches.\nFirst Test.\nWest Indies batted uneasily against the speed of Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller, with Goddard, coming in at No 9, top-scoring with 45. The Australians were similarly diffident against Ramadhin and Valentine, but Miller and Lindwall, as batsmen, were more aggressive. Valentine took five for 99 and Wisden recorded that five catches were dropped off his bowling in the space of half an hour. Weekes with 70 and Gomez (55) set a target, but Doug Ring's leg-breaks took six for 80. After five overs from the West Indies opening bowlers Gomez and Worrell, Goddard relied entirely on Ramadhin and Valentine, and they bowled more than 80 consecutive overs between them. Innings of more than 40 apiece from Arthur Morris, Neil Harvey and Graeme Hole took Australia to a narrow victory, despite Ramadhin's five for 90.\nSecond Test.\nWest Indies batted consistently, with 50s for Worrell (64), Walcott (60), Christiani (76) and Gomez (54). But after Australia had been reduced to 27 for two wickets, Lindsay Hassett was dropped behind the wicket and he went on to score 132 and to put on 235 with Keith Miller, who made 129. Lindwall and Ring then led the tail to a total of 517. Short-pitched bowling by Lindwall and Miller accounted for several of the West Indies batsmen in the second innings, and despite 50s for Weekes and Goddard the Australians needed only 136 to win.\nThird Test.\nRain had seeped under the covers and 22 wickets fell on the first day for 207 runs. Worrell took six for 34 in Australia's first innings, and Bill Johnston took six for 62 when bowling unchanged throughout the West Indies innings. Australia's captain Arthur Morris – Hassett was injured – rejigged the batting order for the second innings. Ian Johnson and Geff Noblet were out before the end of the first day, but in easier conditions Ring made 67 and Morris 45, while Valentine took six for 102. West Indies needed 233 to win and at 141 for four seemed to be wobbling, but dropped catches allowed Christiani and Gomez to see them home.\nFourth Test.\nAn exciting Test began with a century for Worrell, retrieving West Indies from 30 for three with assistance from Gomez and Christiani. Miller took five for 60. Neil Harvey, with 83, and Miller put on 124 for the fourth wicket but the other Australian batsmen failed and Trim took five for 34. West Indies lost wickets regularly, though there were 50s for Stollmeyer and Gomez before a late-order collapse left Australia to get 260. Hassett made 102, but wickets fell to the spin of Ramadhin and Valentine, and at 222 for nine, the match seemed lost. But Ring, with 32, and Johnston made 38 for the last wicket to bring an unlikely victory and win the series.\nFifth Test.\nFirst-day humidity helped the swing bowling of Gomez, who took seven for 55, and Worrell (three for 42), but West Indies fared even worse against the bouncers of Lindwall, Johnston and Miller. Australia's dominance was built on painstaking 60s by Colin McDonald, in his first Test match, Hassett, Miller and Graeme Hole, though Gomez completed a 10 wicket haul in the match. Lindwall and Miller kept up a barrage of bouncers against the West Indies and only Stollmeyer, who made 104, lasted long. Lindwall finished with five for 52. Richie Benaud claimed his first Test wicket with the final delivery of the match."

        "title": "West Indian cricket team in Australia in 1960–61",
        "text": "The West Indies cricket team toured Australia in the 1960–61 season under the captaincy of Frank Worrell. Both Worrell and his opposing captain, Richie Benaud, encouraged their teams to play attacking cricket. The first Test of the five match series ended in a dramatic tie, the first of only two instances in Test cricket. Though West Indies narrowly lost the series 2–1, with one draw in addition to the tie, they might easily have won both the last two matches and taken the series 3–1. They took much credit for contributing to such an exciting series and made themselves extremely popular with the Australian public. Prior to their departure from Australia, the team were paraded through Melbourne in open-top cars on 17 February 1961, and were cheered by enormous crowds.\nWorrell's success as captain was particularly significant, because all previous West Indies captains had been white (except for George Headley in a single home Test in 1947-8).\nThe series marked the first time that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation had covered all five Test matches of a touring team. In 2000, the Corporation produced a two-part documentary of the tour entitled \"Calypso Summer\" which included a mixture of five hours of archived match highlights, anecdotes and current day reflections from the key players. The documentary was released in 2005 as a three-disc DVD.\nWest Indian touring party.\nThe touring party consisted of: FMM Worrell (captain), FCM Alexander (vice-captain), DT Dewdney, LR Gibbs, WW Hall, JL Hendriks, CC Hunte, RB Kanhai, PD Lashley, SM Nurse, S Ramadhin, CW Smith, GS Sobers, JS Solomon, AL Valentine, CD Watson. GE Gomez, the manager, played in three of the minor \"up country\" matches. WMM Marshall, his assistant, played in the match against Tasmania, his only first-class appearance.\nWest Indian successes.\nKanhai, Sobers, Hunte, Alexander, Hall and Gibbs all had fine series. Kanhai showed his quality early on, when he played a fine innings of 252 in the fourth first-class match of the tour, against Victoria. In the fourth Test he achieved the rare feat of scoring a hundred in each innings.\nSobers had been out of form early in the tour, but his century on the first day of the first Test was rated by some watchers as the best hundred they had ever seen. He scored another century in the third Test.\nHunte made a century in the second Test.\nAlexander, the wicketkeeper, had lost the captaincy to Worrell, but he made a major contribution with the bat. In all five Tests he made at least one fifty, and he recorded his first Test century in the third Test.\nGibbs, the off-spinner, made his Test debut, replacing Ramadhin for the last three Tests. He headed the West Indies Test bowling averages for the series, with 19 wickets at an average of 20.78. In his second match, the fourth Test, he took the first Test hat-trick against Australia since J.T. Hearne did so for England at Leeds in 1899.\nThe speed and fire of Hall captured the imagination, and he took nine wickets in the first Test.\nAustralian successes.\nO'Neill scored the only century for Australia, an innings full of character, in the first Test.\nSimpson made two centuries as well as six scores of 70 or over in eight appearances against the touring team, though neither century was in a Test. He made a major contribution to Australia's final victory by hitting 75 and 92.\nGrout had a fine series behind the stumps, assisting in 23 dismissals.\nDavidson took 33 wickets with his accurate left-arm quick bowling, more than any other bowler on either side, even though he missed the fourth Test because of injury. His batting was also important in the first Test, when he did the \"match double\" of 100 or more runs and 10 or more wickets.\nBenaud captured 23 wickets and played a vital innings in the first Test, but his captaincy made an even bigger impact.\nSummary of results.\nAll Matches:\nPlayed 22, Won 10, Lost 5, Drawn 5, Tied 2\nFirst-Class Matches:\nPlayed 14, Won 4, Lost 5, Drawn 4, Tied 1\nTest Matches:\nPlayed 5, Won 1, Lost 2, Drawn 1, Tied 1\nTest series Summary.\nFirst Test.\nAt the end of the first day, West Indies had reached 359–7. After slumping to 65–3, all three wickets being taken by Davidson, Worrell assisted Sobers in taking the score to 239, at which point Sobers was out, his 132 having taken only 174 minutes. Worrell followed shortly afterwards for 65, but Solomon (65) ensured that there would be no collapse.\nNext morning, Alexander took his overnight score of 21 to 60 and Hall, batting at number 10, unexpectedly contributed exactly 50, the two adding 86 for the ninth wicket. When their innings ended, the West Indies' scoring rate was 56 runs per 100 balls, very high by the standards of the time.\nMcDonald (57) and Simpson (92) gave Australia a good start to their innings. Simpson was out just before the close, when Australia were 196–3.\nOn the third day, Australia took a first innings lead of 52, thanks mainly to O'Neill's 181. He was the last man out. At one point Australia had been 469–5, and a large lead had looked likely, but Davidson's dismissal for 44 triggered a collapse, with Hall taking four of the last five wickets. West Indies were 0–0 in their second innings at close of play.\nNext day, West Indies reached 259–9, having been 210–4 at one point. Four batsmen made 39 or more, but none could go on to a big score.\nNext morning, the last wicket pair added 25 more runs which were to prove vital, as well as reducing the time that Australia had at their disposal. They were set 233 to win in what turned out to be 69 eight ball overs. The required run rate was 42 per 100 balls, which should not have been unduly challenging. However Australia made a bad start, and when they were 92–6, Hall having taken four of the wickets, seemed doomed to defeat. However Davidson (80) and Benaud (52) then took the score to 226, with only seven more runs needed.\nNow that all seemed lost, the West Indian fielding, which until now had been fallible in both innings, reached the heights. Three of the last four batsmen were run out in what had by now become a race against time. First Benaud called for a sharp single, but Solomon hit the stumps from mid-wicket to dismiss Davidson, who had had a magnificent match (124 runs and 11 wickets).\nThe new batsman, Grout, then took a single. When the last over, to be bowled by Hall, began, six runs were still required with three wickets left:\nSecond Test.\nAustralia's first innings came at the very high rate for the period of 66 runs per hundred balls. No-one went on to make a big score, however, and when they were 251-8 it seemed that they might be dismissed for a fairly modest total. However the number 10, Martin, helped Mackay to add 97 for the ninth wicket before both were dismissed in quick succession. Martin's 55, in his first Test, took only 67 balls. There was enough time before the close for Davidson to dismiss Solomon for a duck, West Indies closing on 1/1.\nThe second day ended early because of rain. After the early loss of Hunte, Nurse and Kanhai took the score to 108–2, with Kanhai by far the more aggressive, having scored 70 runs to his partner's 35.\nKanhai was out on the third day when the score had reached 124, having made 84. The remaining wickets added only another 57, though Nurse - the sheet anchor - battled away until he was ninth out for 70. His innings included only a single boundary, in sharp contrast to Kanhai's 13, and lasted for 305 minutes. Davidson finished with the fine figures of 6/53. Some rain had seeped through the covers overnight, but the pitch was not difficult enough to justify the West Indian collapse.\nWest Indies had to follow on 167 runs behind. Not long before the end of the day's play they had reached 97–2, but then Martin dismissed Kanhai, Sobers and Worrell - the latter two for ducks - to leave West Indies reeling at 99–5. Hunte, who had batted throughout, and Alexander took the score to 129 by the close, when the former had reached 74 not out.\nOn the fourth day, Hunt and Alexander took the score to 186 before Hunte was out for 110 to the occasional leg-spin of O'Neill. After that, the end of the innings was not long delayed, Alexander being last out for 72. Only Hunte, Kanhai and Alexander had reached double figures.\nThough Australia slumped to 30–3, with Harvey and O'Neill both making ducks, there were no further alarms and they won with a day to spare.\nThird Test.\nWest Indies scored 303–5 on the first day, mainly due to a fine innings by Sobers. When the second new ball was taken after tea, he added 72 at a run a minute, going from 80 to 152.\nSobers was out early on the next day for 168, and West Indies collapsed to 339 all out. Yet again, Davidson had the best bowling figures, 5/80, and Benaud finished with 4/86. Australia had reached 172-5 by the close, mainly thanks to O'Neill, who was the fifth man out at 155.\nOn the third morning, Australia emulated West Indies in collapsing, Gibbs at one point taking three wickets in four balls. West Indies batted again with a lead of 137, but were soon 22–3, all three wickets falling to Davidson. Smith and Worrell repaired the damage with a stand of 101, before Smith was out for 55. More wickets then fell quickly, and West Indies ended the day on 179–7, Worrell being the last man to fall, for 82.\nOn the fourth day Alexander, who had been 11 not out overnight, increased his score to 108, with good support from the tail, taking the game away from Australia. Needing an improbable 464 to win, a good partnership between Harvey and O'Neill took them to 182-2 by the close, with Harvey 84 not out and O'Neill 53 not out.\nOn the final day, Harvey was soon out for 85, and Australia collapsed to the spinners, Gibbs and Valentine. O'Neill made 70. At one point Gibbs took four wickets for two runs in a spell of 27 balls. His final figures were 5/66 and Valentine had 4/86. Each took eight wickets in the match.\nSo after three matches, each side had one win, in addition to the tie.\nFourth Test.\nThough this was the only drawn game of the series, it had a very exciting climax.\nOn the first day West Indies made 348–7, built around a fourth wicket stand of 107 between Kanhai and Worrell. Kanhai made 117 in just 139 minutes, and Worrell scored 71. Benaud took four of the wickets.\nNext morning, West Indies took their score to 393, thanks largely to Alexander's 63 not out. They scored at 55 runs per hundred balls. Australia had reached 221-4 by close of play, with Simpson on 85 not out.\nSimpson was out without addition next morning. After Benaud and Mackay had added 60, Gibbs took a hat-trick with the score on 281, dismissing Mackay for 29 and Grout and Misson for ducks. Australia were now 281–8, and it seemed that West Indies would have a first innings lead of close to one hundred. However Hoare, in what was to be his only Test, helped Benaud to add 85 before he was out for 35, (Hoare had replaced the injured Davidson, whose bowling was badly missed.) Benaud quickly followed for 77, but the deficit had been reduced to 27. By the end of the day's play, West Indies had reached 150–1 in their second innings, with Hunte on 44 not out and Kanhai on 59 not out.\nOn the fourth day, Hunte was run out for 79, after what at the time was a record second wicket stand for West Indies against Australia of 163, but Kanhai went on to his second hundred of the match, 115. Worrell made 53 and Alexander was 87 not out at the declaration on 432–6, made at a rate of 59 runs per 100 balls. This left Australia a mammoth 461 to win, which subsequent events suggested might have been over-cautious. Australia made a terrible start, ending the day on 32–3, with defeat looking likely. First McDonald was run out, and then Hall had both Favell and Simpson caught by Alexander behind the stumps.\nOn the final day, O'Neill and Burge took the score to 113 before Burge was out for 49. O'Neill (65) and Benaud quickly followed, before Mackay and Grout steadied the ship. Mackay had been dropped first ball, which proved to be crucial. Grout was dismissed by Worrell for 42 after the pair had added 59, and he followed up by quickly taking the wickets of Misson and Hoare.\nWhen Kline joined Mackay, Australia were 207-9 and appeared doomed, for there was still one hour and fifty minutes playing time remaining. Only two minutes later, Sobers, fielding only four yards from the bat, appealed confidently for a catch from Mackay off Worrell, but Egar ruled that it was not out. In one of the great rearguard actions, the pair proceeded to play out the remaining time. Mackay was a capable batsman but Kline was a bowler and less used to being asked to make a long stand at the crease. In his thirteen Tests Kline never exceeded the 15 not out that he made on this occasion. Mackay's 62 not out occupied 223 balls, and Kline's score was made from 109. Their unbroken last wicket stand added 66, though the runs were almost an irrelevance.\nFifth Test.\nWest Indies were 252–8 at the end of the first day, after Australia won the toss and asked them to bat. Though all of the dismissed batsmen reached double figures, none could go on to make a substantial score. The best partnership was between Sobers and Lashley, who took the score from 107–4 to 200–5, after which three more wickets fell fairly quickly. When Benaud put West Indies in, he may have hoped that the heavy atmosphere would help Davidson, but for once he was not that effective and the spinners did much of the damage.\nThe second day was a Saturday, and a then world record crowd of 90,800 (and still a record outside India) watched the play. Forty more runs were added by West Indies, with Solomon and Hall completing a useful ninth wicket partnership of 55. Australia reached 236-3 by the end of the day's play, with Burge 37 not out and Mackay 16 not out, and it looked as though they might establish a substantial lead. Simpson (75) and McDonald (91) put on 146 for the first wicket.\nOn the Monday, Australia reached 309 before the sixth wicket fell, Burge being out for 68. But the last four wickets added only 47 runs. Sobers finished with 5/120 and Gibbs with 4/74. So West Indies' deficit on first innings was only 64, and by close of play - at 126-2 - they were reasonably placed, with Hunte 46 not out.\nHunte was soon dismissed on the next morning, for 52, and West Indies subsided to 218–6, only 154 ahead. All of the top five had passed twenty, but none could go on to a big score. However Alexander (73) received useful support from the tail, and when West Indies were all out for 321 Australia needed 258 to win. Yet again, Davidson was the outstanding Australian bowler. McDonald was out just before the close, when Australia were 57–1, with Simpson on 44.\nBenaud, who had gone in as nightwatchman, did not last long the next morning, but Simpson and O'Neill took the score to 154 before the former was third out for 91. So with seven wickets left, Australia only needed another 104. But wickets now fell steadily, including O'Neill for 48, Harvey and Davidson, all three dismissed by Worrell. When Burge was seventh out to Valentine for 53, Australia still needed another 8 runs to win. With four runs required, there was a moment of controversy. Grout late cut Valentine for two runs, but the off bail had fallen to the ground. The umpires consulted, but ruled that the batsman was not out. Thus Australia were 256-7 instead of 254–8. Valentine had Grout's wicket without further addition to the score: 256–8. Still without addition, an easy chance given by Martin was missed, the batsmen taking a single to bring the scores level. Australia then edged home by two wickets, the winning run being a bye. Australia had scored at only 29 runs per 100 balls. At the death, Mackay scored his 3 not out off 51 balls. Worrell bowled 31 8-ball overs in conceding only 43 runs for his 3 wickets, and Gibbs bowled 41 overs in taking 2/68. Valentine took 3/60 in 21.7 overs."

        "text": "The West Indies cricket team toured Australia in the 1975–76 season and played six Test matches and 1 ODI against Australia.\nThe test series was built up as an unofficial World Championship series for the title of best test team in the world. The West Indies came into the series after winning the inaugural 1975 World Cup, defeating Australia with several exciting young talents, most notably in Gordon Greenidge, Andy Roberts and Viv Richards. Australia won the first test in Brisbane at The Gabba convincingly by eight wickets but West Indies came back and defeated them in Perth at the WACA by an innings. However, Australia recovered and beat the West Indies in the remaining four tests, winning the series 5–1.\nThe series was a watershed event in West Indies cricketing history, thereafter adopting the formula of playing four out-and-out fast bowlers after witnessing at first-hand the destruction caused by Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson bowling close to 100 mph.\nGordon Greenidge, who went into the tour as an exciting young batter, struggled badly against Lillee and Thomson before eventually being dropped after suffering a lack of confidence. Therefore, Clive Lloyd opted to use Viv Richards as opener with Roy Fredericks in the final two tests. Despite getting good starts, Richards failed to capitalise in the first four tests, but whilst opening the batting in the final two tests, he scored two centuries and one fifty, ending the tour with 426 runs in 10 innings. This tour was also described as \"the coming of age for Viv Richards\", who went on to become the best batsman in the world and one of few positives for West Indies in a dreadful tour.\nThis was first test series for Greg Chappell as captain of Australia, succeeding his brother Ian Chappell. In the last test at the MCG, Lance Gibbs took his 308th test scalp, passing Fred Trueman.\nOnly ODI.\nBetween the 2nd and 3rd Tests a 40 over ODI was played."

The Fourth Test at Melbourne ended West Indies' then world record of 11 consecutive Test wins as Australia held out for a draw. West Indies lost the Fifth Test by an innings at Sydney where Clive Lloyd played the last of his 110 Tests.\nTest series summary.\nFirst Test.\nCourtney Walsh was selected for his Test debut, and would go on to have a stellar career for the West Indies, taking over 500 wickets.\nMidway through the opening day, it seemed like Kim Hughes' decision to field first was the right one. Two days of rain in Perth before the match had left the pitch unpredictable, and swing bowler Terry Alderman, playing in his first Test since his altercation with a pitch invader at the same ground two years before, took four wickets for five runs in 26 balls to have the West Indies at 104 for five, after Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes had put together an opening partnership of 83. Jeff Dujon and Larry Gomes steadied the innings, leaving the West Indies at 211 for six at stumps on the first day. Dujon had actually taken a blow to the head from Alderman, and had to go off briefly due to complaints of blurred vision.\nThe pair batted all the way through until an hour after lunch on the second day, putting together 149 runs for the seventh wicket, before Dujon was caught behind off Alderman for a well-made 139 which included 21 fours. Gomes was the last man out, by which time he too had made a century (127) and the West Indies had scored 416.\nAustralia got off to a dreadful start, limping to 36 for three at the end of day two, and then collapsing to be all out for 76, their lowest ever innings against the West Indies. Michael Holding took six wickets in eight overs, his 13th haul of five or more wickets in an innings in Test cricket. The Australians were forced to follow on, and lost Kepler Wessels in the first over. John Dyson and Graeme Wood provided some resistance with a 90-run partnership. They were helped in some part by giant paceman Joel Garner, who was no-balled six times in one over! But after they were removed, the middle order again provided feeble resistance, and only a final wicket stand of 59 between Alderman and Geoff Lawson delayed the inevitable innings victory until early on the fourth day.\nWorld Series Cup.\nWest Indies went through the qualifying round of 10 matches unbeaten against Australia and Sri Lanka. The first final though was won by Australia, the West Indies fought back to win the second. This demoralised the Aussies as they easily lost the third."

        "text": "The West Indies cricket team toured Australia during the 1992-93 cricket season and played five Test matches against Australia. The two teams competed for the Frank Worrell Trophy, which the West Indies had held since 1978 and the series was sponsored by Benson &amp; Hedges. West Indies won the series 2–1 with two matches drawn.\nThe West Indies won the fourth test match by one run, the smallest winning margin (by runs) in the history of test cricket.\nIn addition to the Test series, the West Indies also played some tour matches against Sheffield Shield and representative teams, and competed in the limited-overs 1992–93 Australian Tri-Series against Australia and Pakistan.\nTest series summary.\nSecond Test.\nDay One.\nReturning after a two-week sabbatical from international cricket, Australian captain Allan Border again chose to bat after winning the toss. Openers David Boon and Mark Taylor batted with discipline and patience for much of the first session, combining for 38 before Taylor, who had scored 13 off 75 deliveries and was keen to increase the scoring tempo, attempted to play a cut shot to a ball close to the body from Courtney Walsh and ended up top-edging to Brian Lara at first slip. Steve Waugh joined Boon at the crease and the pair took Australia to 100 before Waugh fell for 38, after the umpires had confirmed that Lara had taken a low catch at first slip off Curtly Ambrose. After batting for just over three hours, Boon departed for a hard-fought 46; sensing an opportunity to reach what would have been a well-deserved half-century, he instead top-edged an attempted cut shot to a wide ball from Walsh through to the wicketkeeper David Williams. When Damien Martyn followed soon after thanks to a wonderful catch by Phil Simmons off Ambrose, Australia's score was 115 for four, with Border joining Mark Waugh at the crease.\nAfter both players were given lives by Williams – Border was dropped on five when the West Indian keeper dived and got a glove on a leg-side deflection off Ambrose, and then Waugh on 23 survived a botched stumping off Hooper – they batted through the whole final session and lifted Australia's score to 227 for four, with Waugh 63 not out and Border reaching his 57th Test half-century just before the end of play to be 51 not out.\nDay Two.\nBorder and Waugh continued where they left off from the previous day, batting through the first session and eventually taking Australia past 300. Waugh was again dropped by Williams - this time off Ian Bishop - on 71 and survived several half-chances. Sensing Waugh's nervousness, Border sought to calm his partner and exhort him to concentrate and not throw his wicket away.\nEventually Waugh reached his third Test century, having been at the crease just short of five hours, and hitting nine fours. He was out soon after for 112, having added 204 runs with his captain to Australia's total. Having batted for over five hours, Border then also reached triple figures, sweeping Hooper for three to score his 25th Test century, and his first in Australia for five years. Speaking to the press at the end of the day's play, Border hit back at those questioning his place in the team:\nI have read a lot of negative press in recent times about my position and maybe this has silenced it [...] There's no reason for me to fall off the perch just yet. I've scored nearly 10,000 runs at better than 50 every time and that's not too shabby at all. To get 100 against these fellows you earn every single run you get and that makes it doubly pleasing.\nAfter the remaining batters pushed Australia's first innings score to 395, local hero Merv Hughes gave the MCG crowd something to cheer about, removing the top three West Indian batsmen in a lively six-over spell to reach 150 Test wickets. At stumps the West Indies score was 62 for three, having steadied the ship with Lara (14 not out) and Keith Arthurton (13 not out).\nDay Three.\nAs in the first Test in Brisbane, so Lara and Arthurton again rescued the West Indies innings, combining for a careful 100-run partnership and both reaching half-centuries."

        "text": "The South Africa national cricket team toured Australia in the 1952–53 season and played five Test matches against Australia. The series was drawn 2–2, the first time a rubber between the two sides had not been won by Australia.\nFrom Australia, the South African side moved on to play two Test matches, two other first-class matches and one minor match in New Zealand – see this article. On the return from New Zealand, the team played one further match against Western Australia in Perth.\nOn the Australian legs of the tour, including the Test matches, 16 first-class matches were played, of which four were won by the South Africans, three lost, and nine drawn. Of the six minor matches in Australia, three were won and three drawn. In New Zealand, one Test match was won by the South Africans, and all other matches were drawn.\nSouth African team.\nThe South African side was captained by Jack Cheetham. The manager was Ken Viljoen, who had retired from playing Test cricket only five years before. The full South African touring party was:\nFuller, Funston, Innes, Keith, Murray and Norton had not previously played Test cricket; Fuller, Funston, Keith and Murray made their Test debuts during this series. Innes and Norton, the only two of the party of 15 not to play any Tests on this tour, in fact never played Test cricket.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nMelle, with six for 71, and Watkins (4/41) shared the wickets in Australia's first innings, in which a partnership of 155 for the second wicket between Neil Harvey (109) and Lindsay Hassett (55) provided the substance. Most of the South Africans made some runs, but Waite's 39 was the top score and Doug Ring's leg-spin brought him six wickets for 72 runs. Australia's second innings was also an even-scoring affair, with only Arthur Morris (58) and Harvey (52) passing 50. With Keith Miller unable to bowl because of a throat infection, Australia's attack looked \"ordinary\", said Wisden. But after 69 from McGlew and 65 from Funston, the other batsmen failed against the speed of Ray Lindwall, who took five wickets for 60 runs.\n2nd Test.\nThe first victory over Australia for 42 years looked unlikely at the halfway stage. South Africa's first innings total owed much to a late flourish from Murray, who made 51 after coming in with the score on 126 for seven. Colin McDonald made 82 and Miller 52, but Tayfield's off-breaks brought him six wickets for 84 runs and Mansell supported with his leg-spin, taking three for 58. South Africa's second innings was built on an innings of seven-and-a-half hours by Endean, who made 162 not out, sharing stands of 111 with Waite (62) for the second wicket and 65 with Funston (42) for the fourth. Most of the Australian batsmen got a start to an innings, but only Harvey, with 60, resisted Tayfield for long. A ninth wicket stand of 61 between Richie Benaud (45) and Ring (53) only delayed the inevitable. Tayfield finished with innings figures of seven for 81 and match figures of 13 for 165.\n3rd Test.\nTwo wickets in an over for Lindwall put Australia on top on the first day, and only Funston, with 56, offered much resistance. The Australians lost two cheap wickets, but McDonald and Harvey put on 113 for the third wicket, with McDonald making 67. Then Miller joined Harvey and the pair put on 168 for the fourth wicket, the highest partnership for that wicket for Australia against South Africa. Miller made 55 but Harvey went on to 190 in six hours, and there were runs lower down the order from Ring, who made 58. Facing arrears of 270, South Africa lost two wickets for 10 when Lindwall removed openers McGlew and Waite. Endean, with 71, and McLean (65) put on 99 for the fifth wicket and Watkins made 48, but the match finished on the fourth day.\n4th Test.\nMcDonald and Lindsay Hassett put on 275 for the second Australian wicket, the highest partnership in Tests between the two countries. McDonald made 154 and Hassett 163. Later Harvey hit 84 and Graeme Hole 59 in fast-scoring innings. South Africa opened with Endean making 56, and Waite (44), Funston (92) and Watkins (76) made middle-order runs with cautious batting. But the follow-on was averted only with the last pair at the wicket. Australia's bowling was handicapped by injury to first Miller and then Lindwall. Australia's second innings was largely compiled in a quick 157-run second wicket partnership between Arthur Morris (77) and Harvey, who made 116. The declaration set South Africa 377 to win in 255 minutes and though wickets fell regularly after an opening stand of 81, the Australian attack, without Miller and Lindwall, was unable to finish the job.\n5th Test.\nSouth Africa's victory enabled them to share a series with Australia for the first time. McDonald (41) and Morris (99) opened with a stand of 122 and then Harvey, with 205, shared century stands with Hassett and Ian Craig, who hit 53 on his Test debut. The innings enabled Harvey to beat Donald Bradman's record of 806 runs in a series against South Africa, set in 1931–32. Harvey's seven runs in the second innings meant he finished the series with 834 runs, still, as of 2009, the fourth highest aggregate for a batsman in a single Test series. South Africa batted determinedly in their first innings with five batsmen passing 50 – Waite (64), Watkins (92), McLean (81), Cheetham (66) and Mansell (52). The Australian attack lacked both Lindwall and Miller, who were injured. Australia's second innings was a stuttering affair, with Fuller effective at the start, when he took the wickets of McDonald and Harvey, and at the end, when he added Benaud, Bill Johnston and Geff Noblet to finish with five for 66. Tayfield's three second innings wickets raised his total for the series to 30, the best for a South African in a series against Australia. Set 295 to win on a worn wicket, South Africa started with Endean making 70 and Watkins 50, and the match was won in a fifth wicket partnership of 106 in 80 minutes between Keith and McLean, who hit an unbeaten 76.\nAssessment.\nBefore the series, the relative strengths of the two teams were considered so unequal that there were serious suggestions that it be called off – on the South African side because a crushing defeat would cause long-term damage to the nation's cricket, and on the Australian side because crowds would not be attracted to one-sided matches and the financial results would be disastrous. That the tour was so unexpectedly successful was largely attributed to the management team of Cheetham and Viljoen. The Australian journalist A. G. Moyes wrote:\nFew more competent captains than Jack Cheetham have come to Australia, and Ken Viljoen made the perfect manager, the former star cricketer who combined with it a knowledge of men, a determination to efface himself and work entirely for his team, and a happy knack of being with the team and yet retaining proper control. The members of the team would have done anything for Cheetham and Viljoen, and those of us who travelled with them could understand the reasons. The pair worked together in perfect harmony, and this was one of the chief reasons for the success of a tour which had not been wanted by Australian officials, and which seemed certain to fail because there were no draw-cards among the visitors."

        "text": "The 2008 Ladbrokes.com World Darts Championship was the 15th World Championship organised by the Professional Darts Corporation since it separated from the British Darts Organisation. The event took place between 17 December 2007 and 1 January 2008 at the Alexandra Palace, London, England.\nJohn Part won his third World Championship, beating the qualifier Kirk Shepherd 7–2 in the final. He joined Phil Taylor, Raymond van Barneveld, Eric Bristow, and John Lowe as the only people to have won more than two world titles, although they have since been joined by Martin Adams , Michael van Gerwen and Glen Durrant. He is also one of six players to have won the PDC World Darts Championship more than once, along with Phil Taylor, Adrian Lewis, Gary Anderson, Michael van Gerwen and Peter Wright. In addition, he became the first player to have won World Championships in three different venues; the Lakeside, the Circus Tavern and the Alexandra Palace.\nRaymond van Barneveld was the defending champion having won the PDC World Championship at the first attempt in an epic final against Taylor in 2007. He was knocked out in the third round with a 4–2 loss to Kevin Painter.\nTaylor failed to reach the final of the competition for the first time in PDC World Championship history, after losing 5–4 to Wayne Mardle in the quarter-finals.\nIn addition to several highly ranked players failing to reach the latter stages of the competition, an argument could be made that this tournament had, statistically, the lowest standard of play from any PDC World Championship this millennium. A distinct lack of quality was exhibited across the draw: no single player achieved a 3-dart average of over 100 in any match in the entire tournament, the highest being John Part's average of 99.06 in his second-round match against Mensur Suljovic; additionally, there were only six 3-dart averages of 96 or higher in any match in the entire tournament (see Draw below). Kirk Shepherd, meanwhile, incredibly finished runner-up in the tournament without averaging over 90 in any match he played in the tournament - he is the only player to achieve this feat in any PDC World Championship event this millennium. Shepherd was also the first player making his PDC World Championship debut to reach the final, without having played in a BDO World Championship.\nAfter being staged at the Circus Tavern in Purfleet for 14 years, the tournament moved to the Alexandra Palace in London. The championships had been considered to have outgrown the Circus Tavern whose capacity of 800–1,000 spectators was considerably smaller than some Holsten Premier League darts events in 2007 which saw crowds reaching 5,000. The Alexandra Palace was the venue of the News of the World Darts Championship between 1963 and 1977 and boasts a capacity for 2008 of 2,500.\nFormat and qualifiers.\nThe televised stages featured 68 players. The top 32 players in the PDC Order of Merit on 12 November 2007 received an automatic place in the World Championship. They were joined by 16 PDPA members and 20 international qualifiers determined by the PDC and PDPA.\nThe 16 PDPA members were made up from the top eight players (who had not already qualified) in the PDC Pro Tour Events during 2007: Jelle Klaasen, Mark Walsh, Tony Eccles, Michael van Gerwen, Steve Brown, Dave Askew, Jason Clark and Matt Clark.\nThe final eight qualifiers were determined at a PDPA Qualifying event which was held on 17 November 2007 in Wolverhampton – prior to the Grand Slam of Darts tournament. The successful players were Steve Maish, Jan van der Rassel, Colin Monk, Steve Evans, Jamie Caven, Steve Hine, Kirk Shepherd and Jason Barry. Former world champions John Lowe, Eric Bristow, Keith Deller and Richie Burnett all played in the qualifying rounds but failed to reach the televised stages.\nOrder of Merit\nPro Tour\nPDPA qualifiers\nPDC North American Pro TourOrder of Merit\"First round qualifiers\"\nDutch/Belgian DDFOrder of Merit\"First round qualifiers\"\nGerman Darts CorporationOrder of Merit\"First round qualifiers\"\nDanish Order of Merit\"First round qualifiers\"\nAustralia Order of Merit\"First round qualifiers\"\nOceanic Masters winner\"First round qualifiers\"\nSouth African Open winner\"First round qualifiers\"\nInternational qualifiers\"Preliminary round qualifiers\"\nPrize money.\nThe 2008 World Championship featured a prize fund of £589,000.

Painter hit seven consecutive treble 20s, en route to a possible nine dart leg before missing a treble 19 before completing a remarkable ten darter to go through to the quarter-finals.\nEarlier, James Wade overcame flu and Mark Dudbridge 4–2 to go through to his first World quarter-final and Kirk Shepherd defeated Barrie Bates 4–2 to be the surprise quarter-finalist. Peter Manley and John Part both had comfortable wins in their last 16 matches.\nThe talking point of the day may have been the Adrian Lewis v Tony Eccles clash. Eccles started in sensational fashion winning the first eight legs, but couldn't close out the third set. He missed two darts at a double for a 3–0 sets lead and then Lewis started a fightback winning the next three sets to lead 3–2. Eccles fought back himself to level the match, but controversy came in the final set when the scores were level at 2 legs each. Lewis took an unscheduled comfort break just minutes after a scheduled one and when he came back he found his rhythm to win the next two legs and make the quarter-finals.\nDay ten, quarter-finals, Saturday 29 December.\nFor the first time in the 15-year history of the event, Phil Taylor failed to make it to the final after losing to Wayne Mardle. Taylor took an early 3–0 lead, but after winning a set Mardle's confidence increased and with the crowd behind him brought it back to 3–3. With the sets tied 4–4 the legs went with throw until 4–4 when Mardle broke Taylor with tops after Taylor missed double sixteen when the dart went the wrong side of the wire. Wayne closed out the match on his own darts with 140 and double 18 to win the final set 6–4 and a 5–4 win. Mardle immediately broke down into tears after the win. After the match Mardle said \"it's not being in the semis that's important... it's beating that guy there (Taylor); he didn't play well, but I still had to play at my best to beat him\"\nTaylor said \"When I was 3 sets to nil up, I thought I'm going to beat him 5–0... If he gets his game together now he's got the biggest chance of his life to win it\".\nWorld Matchplay champion James Wade also went out in the quarter-finals to two-time former World Champion John Part. It was a close match, but Part always stayed in front after establishing a 2–0 set lead. Wade did fight back from 1–3 to level the match.\nKirk Shepherd continued his amazing run and for the third time in the tournament survived his opponent having darts to win the match. Peter Manley had two darts to win the final set 3–0, but Shepherd came back to win the final set 4–2. After sharing the first four sets, Kevin Painter beat Adrian Lewis 5–2.\nDay Eleven, Semi-finals, Sunday 30 December.\nKirk Shepherd's sensational run in the tournament continued as he beat Wayne Mardle in the semi-final to reach the final. Shepherd, the 21-year-old qualifier built up a 3–1 set lead and missed five darts to go 4–1 up only to see Mardle come back to take the lead 4–3. Mardle, who had beaten Phil Taylor the previous night in the quarter-finals looked to be on his way to his first world final before Shepherd fought back again to take the next three sets and become the first qualifier to reach the PDC World final.\nThe other semi-final was a more clinical performance as John Part returned to the final always having the edge over 2004 finalist Kevin Painter. The fourth set was potential decisive as Painter missed darts to take a 2–0 leg lead. Part then took out the next two legs and a 13-darter in the fourth leg gave him a 3–1 set lead. Painter missed a dart at bullseye to bring the score back to 2–3, leaving Part a 44 finish to go 4–1 up – then also missed a chance to take the sixth set. Part took the match with a classy 130 finish for a 6–2 win.\nDay Twelve, Final, Tuesday 1 January 2008.\nJohn Part became World Champion for the third time with a ruthless 7–2 victory over qualifier Kirk Shepherd. Shepherd had beaten world number four Terry Jenkins, three time world finalist Peter Manley and Phil Taylor's conqueror Wayne Mardle to become the first qualifier to reach the PDC World final – but he had no answer to Part's experience in the final. The early stages of the match were close with both of the first two sets going down to a deciding leg. Part just edged the first set and in the deciding leg of the second started with 140, 180 and a 15-dart leg for a 2–0 lead. Part then ran off the next six legs to find himself 4–0 in front and missed a bullseye for a 5–0 lead before Shepherd took his first set. The sixth set again went to last leg with Part re-establishing a four set lead but Shepherd continued to battle away and took the seventh set with a brilliant 160 finish. Part opened the eighth set with a 139 finish, then Shepherd hit an 88 to level it before checkouts of 52 and 80 from Part took him one set away from victory at 6–2. The Canadian closed out victory in the ninth set with a double ten in the fifth leg."

        "title": "Croydon Pirates Baseball Club",
        "text": "The Croydon Pirates, known between 2012 and 2019 as the South London Pirates, is a British baseball club based in South London. They have two diamonds in Roundshaw playing fields in Sutton, UK the main one being Dave Ward Field. Previously, Roundshaw and the Pirates have been hosts to the yearly London Tournament and on occasions the BBF's National Finals.\nFrom 2004 until 2017, the Pirates were made up of different teams competing at various levels including the National League, double-A, and single-A. Since 2020, the team has competed only at the double-A level.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe club was formed around 1980 by Eric Petrie and Pete Paulley, who had previously played for the Croydon Blue Jays. The first team played as the Croydon Borough Pirates and placed 3rd in the 1981 Southern England Baseball Association (Group B) division with a 5–11 record.\nFor the 1989 season, the team was renamed the Croydon Pirates, continuing to play in the 2nd Division which by this time featured twelve teams. They finished the season placed 4th with a 15–10 record, including a seven-inning, one-hitter in which pitcher Chris Gahan recorded 21 strikeouts against the Croydon Blue Jays.\nIn the 1990s, the Pirates continued to set unexpected records. In 1992, across 16 games, the team collectively notched 355 stolen bases with zero times caught stealing. Club founder Eric Petrie recorded the most, with 48.\nNational success.\nFrom 2004 the team's top players formed the P1 roster, which competed in the National Baseball League, the top flight of British baseball. The P1 team were National Champions in 2004, defeating the Windsor Bears 12–10 in the National Championship game, and again in 2005, beating the Brighton Buccaneers 2–0 in a best-of-three series.\nAfter being runners-up to the Richmond Flames in 2006, their 2007 regular season record of 26 wins and 0 losses earned them the right to compete in the Final 4 tournament for the 4th consecutive year, on the weekend of 1–2 September 2007 along with the London Mets, Menwith Hill Patriots and Liverpool Trojans. Croydon and the Mets won their semi-finals to advance to the final, where the Pirates were defeated 2–0 in a best-of-3 series.\nDevelopmental team.\nAround this time a second roster of developmental players was started, which competed at the single-A level. In 2005 they became Premier Division Champions, notably winning 9 of their last 10 games to claim the title.\nIn 2008, this P3 team again won their British Baseball single-A division, finishing the season with a record of 10 wins and 2 losses. They were promoted to the double-A division for the 2009 season.\n2012–2017: The South London Pirates.\nIn 2012 the club changed its name to the South London Pirates. South London Pirates I (formerly P1) played in the British NBL; while South London Pirates III (P3) played in the AA South Division. However, in 2017, falling player numbers halted the club from competing in either league.\n2019 revival and current team.\nAfter two years without a team, the Pirates once again began playing under the Croydon name and hosted a series of friendlies in autumn 2019, before joining the AA South Division for the 2020 season, competing against the Guildford Mavericks, London Musketeers, Richmond Dragons, and South Coast Pirates.\nThe season, shortened due to COVID-19, saw the team competing in a series of double-headers throughout August, finishing 4th with a 3–4 record along with one rained-off game.\nThe 2021 season brought greater success, however, with the team posting a 21–9 season record and narrowly losing to the London Sidewinders 20–19 in the playoffs. They beat the Milton Keynes Bucks 13–10 to place 3rd overall.\nHome ground.\nThe Croydon Pirates play their home games at Roundshaw Playing Fields in Waddon, located a few miles southwest of Croydon. The playing fields occupy part of the site of the former Croydon Airport, London's primary airport in the interwar years.\nCurrently, the Pirates have the use of two purpose-built diamonds, including Dave Ward Field, a fenced field measuring 395 ft from home plate to the centre field boundary. Named in honour of the former Pirates player and manager, its left field and right field lines measure 320 ft and 307 ft respectively, and there is a bullpen behind the left field foul line. The other field is unnamed and has a full dirt infield and unfenced outfield. Both make use of the shared pavilion on Hannibal Way.\nThe London Tournament.\nThroughout its history, the club has regularly hosted an invitational tournament at Roundshaw, usually held around mid-July and known as The London Tournament. Open to a variety of teams from around the British leagues, the popular weekend-long competition has also included a Home Run Derby. The Croydon Wolves, with whom the Pirates shared Roundshaw in the 1990s, have also hosted."

        "title": "Brisbane City (rugby union)",
        "text": "Brisbane City is an Australian rugby union football team based in Brisbane that competed in the National Rugby Championship (NRC). The team is one of two Queensland sides in the competition, the other being . Brisbane City is organised and managed by the Queensland Rugby Union (QRU), with the coaching and training programs utilised by the Queensland Reds being extended to players joining the team from the Reds and Queensland Premier Rugby teams.\nThe Brisbane City team in the NRC takes its identity from the metropolitan rugby team that has represented Brisbane for more than a century. The representative team's colours and a similar logo were inherited for the NRC. The Brisbane City uniform is yellow and blue, with a crest of the City Hall logo within Queensland Rugby's traditional 'Q' on the jersey's chest.\nThe NRC was launched in 2014, reinstating the national competition after the Australian Rugby Championship (ARC) was discontinued following the first season in 2007. The Brisbane City NRC team utilises existing QRU staffing roles and infrastructure, with the team's home ground and training base located at QRU's headquarters at Ballymore.\nHistory.\nBrisbane's earliest recorded intercity football match under Rugby Union rules took place on 19 August 1878 when Brisbane FC played Ipswich FC. The teams played again three weeks later under Victorian Rules. This was five years before the foundation of the Northern Rugby Union (the NRU, which was later to become the QRU). In the early years of rugby in Queensland, teams from country areas such as Toowoomba, Rockhampton and Charters Towers were Brisbane's main on-field rivals.\nRepresentative team.\nBrisbane representative sides have been selected from the premier clubs in the city's competition for more than a hundred years to play teams from other areas of Queensland as well as international and provincial touring sides. A Brisbane Metropolitan side played the visiting British Isles team in 1904, and later Brisbane representative teams played the All Blacks in 1951 and Fiji in 1954.\nThe first City-Country rugby match between Brisbane and Queensland Country (selected from the rest of Queensland) was held at the inaugural Country Week carnival hosted by the QRU in 1902. Country Week carnivals became sporadic with the rise of rugby league after 1909, and the start of the First World War brought rugby union to a halt in Queensland in 1914. The QRU was revived in 1928–29, but rugby languished in country regions of the state for many years.\nCity-Country matches were resumed in 1965. From 1968 until 1982, annual Country Carnival competitions were held from which the Country team was selected to play Brisbane and other representative sides. The Country Carnival was discontinued in favour of State Championships in 1983, and the format of competition has varied over time, but City-Country matches between representative teams from Brisbane and Queensland Country have remained regular fixtures since.\nBallymore Tornadoes (ARC team).\nIn 2006, after setting up a consultative process culminating in a working session of some 70 delegates from around the country, the Australian Rugby Union announced that a new, eight-team national competition would commence in 2007 to compete for the Australian Rugby Championship (ARC).\nThe Ballymore Tornadoes was the Brisbane-based team in the ARC, and the team played its home matches at Ballymore Stadium. The team's colours were maroon, blue and silver. The Ballymore Tornadoes side was one of two Queensland teams supported by the QRU in the competition, alongside the East Coast Aces.\nQueensland's two teams in the ARC were aligned with existing clubs and regions. The Tornadoes were aligned with six Queensland Premier Rugby clubs north of the Brisbane River – Brothers, GPS, Norths/QUT, Sunshine Coast, University and Wests. Chris Roche, a former Wallaby who played 17 Tests as well as 49 matches for the Reds during the 1980s, was the head coach of the Tornadoes. Paul Healy was the assistant coach.\nThe Australian Rugby Championship was terminated at the end of 2007 after only one season of competition, with the Australian Rugby Union citing higher costs than budgeted and further projected financial losses. The Tornadoes team was disbanded with the end of the ARC competition.\nNational Rugby Championship.\nIn December 2013, the ARU announced that the national competition was to be relaunched, with the National Rugby Championship (NRC) commencing in 2014. Expressions of interest were open to any interested parties, with the accepted bids finalised in early 2014. There was initial interest from Brisbane clubs in forming NRC teams themselves, but to eliminate the risks to sub-unions and clubs the Queensland Rugby Union decided to organise and manage two teams centrally for the first year of the competition. On 24 March 2014, it was announced that the Brisbane City and Queensland Country teams would play in the NRC competition.\nBrisbane City secured McInnes Wilson Lawyers as principal sponsor for the 2014 NRC season.\nStadium.\nThe home ground for the Brisbane City team is Ballymore. The stadium was built in 1966 and is the traditional home of Queensland Rugby. The Queensland Reds played their home matches in the Super Rugby competition at Ballymore until the end of the 2005 season, before they moved to the larger Suncorp Stadium for 2006. Ballymore has a capacity of around 24,000. Test matches have also been played at Ballymore, including Bledisloe Cup matches, and a semi-final of the 1987 Rugby World Cup.\nBrisbane City also played a home game at Suncorp Stadium in 2014, as the curtain raiser to the Bledisloe Cup match.\nRecords.\nSeason standings.\nNational Rugby Championship\nAustralian Rugby Championship (Tornadoes)"

        "text": "Robert S. \"Sonny\" Parker (born March 22, 1955) is an American former professional basketball player who played small forward and shooting guard for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was drafted in the first round of the NBA draft after attending and playing basketball at Texas A&amp;M University. After retiring from basketball, Parker created the Sonny Parker Youth Foundation in Chicago to help inner-city students.\nEarly years.\nParker was born in Chicago, Illinois and attended Chicago's Farragut High School, where he received All-City, All-State, and All-Public League honors. In appreciation of his efforts on the school's basketball team, he has been named to the Farragut Hall of Fame, the Chicago Public Schools Hall of Fame, and the Illinois High School Hall of Fame.\nAfter graduating from high school, Parker spent two years at Mineral Area College. In both of his seasons, Parker was named an All-American, as well as Conference Player of the Year and Region Player of the Year. He was an All-Conference and All-Region pick, and is the Mineral Area College's Leading Career Scorer. He has been inducted into the National Junior College Hall of Fame. The 1973 team won the conference championship.\nCollege career.\nAlthough Parker was recruited by many of the top college basketball programs, he chose to attend Texas A&amp;M University, primarily to learn under legendary coach Shelby Metcalf. The lonely Parker, over 1000 miles from home, was quickly embraced by Metcalf and his family, often accompanying his coach on fishing trips. The men became close enough friends that after Parker was named the most valuable player in one of the many college tournaments in which A&amp;M participated, he gave his reward, a nice watch, to Metcalf as a gift. Metcalf treasured the watch for twenty-five years, before giving it to Parker's son Christian at the ceremony inducting Parker into the Texas A&amp;M Athletic Hall of Fame. At Metcalf's funeral in February 2007, Parker gave a eulogy and served as one of the pallbearers.\nIn his two years at Texas A&amp;M, Parker led the Aggies to back-to-back Southwest Conference titles, earning himself first-team All-Southwest Conference honors both years as well. The team reached the NCAA Tournament in 1974-1975. As a senior, Parker averaged 20.7 points per game, a feat that only two other Aggie players have achieved in the 20 years since he left.\nProfessional career.\nParker was a first-round draft pick, chosen by the Golden State Warriors as the 17th overall pick in the 1976 NBA draft. For 29 years, Parker held the record as the highest an Aggie had ever been drafted, until in 2005 Antoine Wright was chosen as the 15th overall draft pick by the New Jersey Nets.\nIn his rookie season, Parker played in 65 games, scoring a total of 379 points (5.8 points per game), with 2.7 rebounds per game and .9 assists per game. His team reached the playoffs, with Parker contributing 4.2 points per game and 2.8 rebounds, and .9 assists per game.\nThe following season, Parker played in 82 games, averaging 11.4 points per game, 4.7 rebounds, and 1.9 assists. He ranked 16th in the NBA for Field Goal Percentage, with .519 field goals (406 out of 783). His best season, however, came in 1978-1979, where he averaged 15.2 points, 5.7 rebounds, and 3.7 assists per game, with 144 steals and 33 blocks.\nIn a thrilling game in November 1981, Parker led the Warriors to a 102-100 victory over the Houston Rockets. At the opening of the final quarter, the Warriors trailed by 10 points before Parker and teammate Joe Hassett combined to score 13 points and give the Warriors their first lead with 3 minutes left to play. The game was tied at 100 when Parker rebounded a shot by his teammate Lloyd Free with two seconds remaining and completed a reverse layup to give the Warriors their victory.\nAfter a disappointing 1981-82 season, where Parker averaged only 3.9 points, 2.5 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game, in September 1982 the Warriors waived Parker, ending his NBA career.\nFor the six years that he played professional basketball, Parker averaged 9.9 points, 4.1 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game.\nYouth Foundation.\nIn 1990, Parker established the non-profit Sonny Parker Youth Foundation (SPYF) in his hometown of Chicago. The foundation is designed to provide year-round educational, recreational, and multi-cultural programs for inner-city children from kindergarten through 12th grade. Through after-school and weekend programs, the foundation provides tutoring, ACT/SAT preparation, parents' workshops, job training, mentoring, career planning, and physical education in the hopes of improving the reading and writing skills of the students and preparing them to become more productive citizens. Parker is the president of the organization and is active in its daily activities.\nPersonal life.\nParker and his wife, Lola, have seven children. Parker's son Christian played at BYU-Hawaii before serving an LDS mission in Atlanta, Georgia; upon return he finished his career at the College of Southern Idaho. He then enrolled at the University of Washington; he aspires to become a collegiate basketball coach. Parker's eldest son, Darryl, is a graduate of the University of Oregon and played professional basketball overseas. He is now a Chicago police officer. Parker's son Jabari is a former Duke basketball player who was selected by the Milwaukee Bucks with the 2nd pick in the 2014 NBA draft. Sonny was afflicted with kidney problems that require dialysis, making it difficult for him to attend Jabari's games."

        "title": "Outlaw Tennis",
        "text": "Outlaw Tennis is a video game based on the sport of tennis published for the Xbox and PlayStation 2, and the last game in the \"Outlaw\" series to be released in 2005. Actor and political satirist Stephen Colbert provides the voice of the game's announcer.\nGame modes.\nThere are two Match Types Available in this mode, Singles (1 vs 1) or Canadian Doubles (1 vs 2). When Advantage is turned on at deuce (40-40), one player has to win the game. The player who wins the next point takes the game. If Win by 2 Games is turned on, at 5-5, the player must then win by two games, however at 6-6, a tiebreak is played to determine who wins the set. The tiebreak rules are the first player to reach seven points win the tiebreak and set, at 6 points all, the player who wins two consecutive points wins the tiebreak and the set. The Games per set option allows the player to choose the number of games to win a set. The minimum is two games and the maximum is 6. Sets per Match determines how many sets are in the match. As with typical tennis, 1, 3, or 5 sets can be played. A1 difficulty determines the hardness of the game. The default level is Pro, however the player can set the level at Amateur for newer players or Veteran for the big time tennis players. When Time Bombs are turned on every 5 seconds or so whoever last hit the ball will get blown up with the time bomb. Whenever smoke appears the player needs to get the ball back on the other side of the court before they get blown away. Team Match Timer when turned on, is much like a chess clock whereas once the ball is hit the time stops but when the opponent returns the shot, it begins again. The match timer can also be enabled. Whoever is in the lead when time runs up wins. Challenges are set by the empire, Heavy G. When turned on at the beginning of the match, Heavy G will present a challenge which ever play wins the challenge first receives 30-seconds of unlimited turbo. The Outlaw Blockers is a malicious square of digital fiberglass that slides back and forth along the net. Known as the great equalizer, the player can try to avoid it, or try timing it, but it will ultimately best the player. Weather can also be switched on or off. When turned on there is a chance for rain or snow.\nReception.\nThe game was met with average reception. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 70% and 66 out of 100 for the Xbox version, and 69% and 67 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version.\n\"Detroit Free Press\" gave the PS2 version a score of three stars out of four and stated that \"The online features, variety of characters and deep play modes [make] \"Outlaw Tennis\" a keeper -- especially at its cheap price.\" However, \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" gave the Xbox version a score of three-and-a-half stars out of five and said, \"The outrageous characters, puerile gags and crass commentary provide chuckles but the jokes soon become stale. Player reactions after each point also quickly become tiresome.\" \"Maxim\" gave both versions of the game three stars out of five and stated that the game \"plays as well as a regulation tennis game. It has the same responsive controls, and even lets you play online doubles with your friends -- assuming they're more likely to chug a Country Club than apply to one.\""

        "title": "Cross-country cycling",
        "text": "Cross-country (XC) cycling is a discipline of mountain biking. Cross-country cycling became an Olympic sport in 1996 and is the only form of mountain biking practiced at the Olympics.\nTerrain.\nCross-country cycling is defined by the terrain on which it is performed. XC courses and trails consist of a mix of rough forest paths and singletrack (also referred to as doubletrack depending on width), smooth fireroads, and even paved paths connecting other trails. Until recently cross-country trails were deemed \"easy\" or \"intermediate\", due to the concept that this discipline of mountain biking relies more on physical ability than technical prowess.\nBikes and equipment.\nCross-country bicycles are some of the lightest mountain bikes, typically between . They usually feature suspension forks in front and often have suspension in the rear. In both the front and rear, most XC bicycles have approximately of suspension travel and max out at 120 millimeters at the front typically (although on occasion it is 130 millimeters) and 120 millimeters in the rear, although some riders prefer of travel as bicycle frame strength and technology advance, but most mountain bikes past 130 mm of suspension on either the front or rear are not regarded as cross-country bikes. The geometry of the frames generally places the rider in a little more upright position than on a road bicycle but much less than on a downhill bike which allows for more nimble handling and better climbing characteristics along with a more comfortable pedaling position at the expense of stability, especially when going downhill. Despite this, most brands are designing their cross-country bikes to have more stable handling, especially when going downhill at the expense of nimble handling and better climbing characteristics, but less so.\nBicycle helmets are nearly universally used for cross-country riding. However, XC riders only rarely wear full-face helmets and do not wear the full body \"armor\" employed by downhill riders and tend to wear helmets similar to well ventilated road helmets, but helmets most often used by enduro and trail riders are also used. Cross-country cyclists are more prone to injuries than road cyclists; however, the injuries sustained by XC riders are usually not as severe.\nRacing.\nCross-country racing emphasizes endurance above technical prowess, and races vary from 30 minutes to 24 hours in length. More recently a new category has emerged called Marathon Cross Country or \"Marathon Distance\". Generally, the marathon distance bike races are over 50 miles. Anything under 50 miles is still called cross country. Additionally, many mountain bike races are divided up into stages so as to span several days. Races can be either point-to-point or lap-based. Short-track cross-country consists of many very short laps so as to be spectator-friendly.\nUnlike downhill races, which are conducted in a time trial format, cross-country races traditionally feature a mass start or interval start, where riders are released in several large groups divided by age and/or ability. Races with very large fields that do not wish to stagger starts will sometimes employ a Le Mans start where racers begin by running to their bikes.\nGlobally, XC racing is governed by the Union Cycliste Internationale. In the United States, it is under the purview of USACMTB, a division of USA Cycling. In the United Kingdom, British Cycling is the governing body.\nRacing disciplines.\nXC racing exists in four main formats: XCE (Cross-Country eliminator), XCO (Cross-Country Olympic), XCC (Cross-Country Short Circuit) and XCM (Cross-Country Marathon).\nCross-Country Eliminator (XCE).\nA discipline where the top two riders advance to the next round and the other two riders are eliminated. Each race has a maximum duration of 60 seconds. It is similar to four-cross, which is a downhill discipline.\nCross-Country Olympic (XCO).\nConsists of completing multiple laps around a 4-10 km (2.5-6.0 mile) circuit, with a duration of about 90 minutes for elite classes. It is the only cross-country discipline in the Olympics programme.\nCross-Country Short Circuit (XCC).\nA race similar to XCO racing, but with laps typically under 1.0-2.0 km (0.6-1.2 miles) in length in less technical terrain, and a duration of 20-25 minutes. Similarly, the number of laps is determined by how many laps can be completed in that timeframe at maximum given previous lap times.\nXCC races typically determine the order that racers in an XCO race will be in and are typically held 2 days before the XCO race if they will determine the starting order.\nCross-Country Marathon (XCM).\nWith a route usually between 65 and 100 km. It has gained popularity in the last years, because XCM competition participation is open to everyone, including beginners.\nWheel size.\nIn cross-country, a wider variety of wheel sizes have been used historically compared to other disciplines, although recently most riders have settled on a single wheel size. The 26-inch wheel size initially used in mountain biking has all but died off at the top level of cross-country racing, with 29″ wheels becoming the norm and 650b wheels being used occasionally. 650b wheels are 584 mm diameter wheels, and approximately 27.5″ with a mounted tire, hence their more common name, \"27.5 inch wheels.\" \nMost manufacturers of new cross-country bikes no longer offer bikes with 26″ wheels; 650b wheels are becoming less common and typically are only present on a handful of lower end cross-country bikes with a handful of exceptions (a notable one being the Pivot LES 27.5). 29″ wheels have become the standard available on all but a select few cross-country bikes and are the only wheel size used at most XC races (this is most notable at professional level races such as the UCI Mountain Bike World Championships where 29″ wheels are the only wheel size used). 29″ inch wheels started rapidly gaining popularity in the mid to late 2000s, and have become very successful in cross-country racing as a whole. A notable boost to their popularity came with Lance Armstrong, racing and winning on a Gary Fisher 29er. Advantages to the larger wheel formats are less need for suspension due to a decreased angle of attack, more energy propelling the bike forward per pedal stroke, and also less loss of momentum. Disadvantages include slightly increased weight, decreased acceleration, higher rolling inertia, rider fit issues for those under 5′5″ (165 cm), and slower handling, although handling issues are being addressed successfully in newer designs with geometry changes like steeper head tube angles and higher fork offsets (although these changes are being reversed slowly by most brands to increase stability). A further disadvantage is that, all other variables (spoke number, rim design and material, etc.) being equal, a 26″ wheel will be much stronger than a 29″ one."

        "text": "The Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team is the men's college basketball program representing the University of Louisville (U of L) in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) of NCAA Division I. The Cardinals have officially won two NCAA championships in 1980 and 1986 (with the 2013 title being vacated); and have officially been to 8 Final Fours (with the 2012 and 2013 appearances being vacated) in 39 official NCAA tournament appearances while compiling 61 tournament wins.\nHistory.\n\"Peck\" Hickman era (1944–1967).\nBernard \"Peck\" Hickman's 1944 team finished with a 16–3 record and started a string of 46 consecutive winning seasons, which was an NCAA record.\nHickman led Louisville to its first championship on a national level by winning the NAIB tournament in 1948. In 1956, led by All-American Charlie Tyra, the Cardinals won the NIT Championship. In 1956 his team was placed on two years probation, to include bans on postseason play, by the NCAA due to recruiting violations. In 1959, Louisville made its first NCAA Final Four appearance behind the play of All-American Don Goldstein.\nThe Cardinals never had a losing season in Hickman's 23 seasons as head coach. He coached 11 20-win teams, appeared in five NCAA tournaments, coached six NIT appearances and finished with a 443–183 overall record, a .708 winning percentage that ranks him in the top 45 all time.\nJohn Dromo era (1967–1971).\nJohn Dromo was Hickman's assistant for 17 years and succeeded him at head coach in 1967. In four seasons as head coach, Dromo led the Cardinals to a 68–23 record (.747 winning percentage) and the 1967 Missouri Valley Conference title.\nA heart attack during the 1970–71 season forced Dromo to retire. His assistant, Howard Stacey, was named interim head coach for the final 20 games of the season.\nDenny Crum era (1971–2001).\nDenny Crum was hired as head coach from his alma mater, UCLA, where he was the top assistant coach to John Wooden. It was under the guidance of Crum that Louisville became a college basketball power. In his first season, he guided the Cardinals to the NCAA Final Four, becoming the first coach ever to go to a Final Four in his first season as a head coach. Overall, Crum had six Final Fours with the Cardinals (1972, 1975, 1980, 1982, 1983, 1986). He is fifth all-time in Final Four appearances.\nThe Cardinals won the 1980 NCAA tournament championship by defeating UCLA 59–54. Six years later, Louisville would overcome Duke 72–69 for a second title. Crum is one of only 11 coaches to win two or more national championships. He was named National Coach of the Year in 1980, 1983 and 1986.\nHe took the Cardinals to 23 NCAA tournaments, where they had an overall record of 43–21. While in the Metro Conference, the Cardinals won 12 regular season titles and 11 tournament championships. In its 19 years of naming a champion, the Metro had Louisville as first or second place 17 times. In 1993, Crum became the second fastest coach to reach 500 wins.\nCrum was inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame in 1994. He retired in 2001 with a career record of 675–295 (.696 winning percentage) over 30 seasons. He was a member of the College Basketball Hall of Fame's inaugural class in 2006.\nRick Pitino era (2001–2017).\nRick Pitino was hired in 2001 after four years as head coach of the Boston Celtics, and previously as head coach of Louisville's in-state rival, Kentucky.\nPitino guided the Cardinals to the NCAA Tournament in 12 of 15 seasons, reaching the Elite Eight six times and the Final Four three times (2005, 2012, and 2013). His teams won six conference tournament championships and four regular season titles. The Cardinals won at least 20 games every season since Pitino's first season at Louisville. Through the 2015–16 season, Pitino amassed a record of 391–134 () during his time at Louisville.\nPitino was selected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013, and was under contract through the 2025–26 season.\nThe University of Louisville self-imposed a postseason ban for the 2015–16 season amid an ongoing NCAA investigation over an escort sex scandal involving recruits between 2010 and 2014. The ban included both the ACC tournament and the NCAA tournament.\nOn June 15, 2017, the NCAA charged Rick Pitino for failure to monitor his basketball program which was involved in a sex-for-pay scandal. He was suspended for the first five games of the ACC season in 2017–18.\nOn September 26, 2017, federal prosecutors in New York announced that the school was under investigation for an alleged \"pay for play\" scheme involving recruits at Louisville. The allegations state that an Adidas executive conspired to pay $100,000 to the family of a top-ranked national recruit to play at Louisville and to represent Adidas when he turned pro. The criminal complaint did not name Louisville specifically but appeared to involve the recruitment of Brian Bowen, a late, surprise commit to the school. On September 27, 2017, Pitino and athletic director Tom Jurich were placed on administrative leave.\nOn October 26, 2017, Rick Pitino was fired as the head coach of Louisville Men's Basketball.\nOn February 20, 2018, the NCAA ruled that Louisville must vacate its records from 2011 to 2015. This included 123 wins, the 2013 NCAA title, and a 2012 Final Four appearance.\nChris Mack era (2018–2022).\nOn March 27, 2018, Xavier head coach Chris Mack agreed to terms on a seven-year contract worth about $4 million annually to become the next head coach at Louisville. Louisville was the first ever school to hire away a head coach whose previous team was a 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. Mack had a notable start to his Louisville tenure, recruiting a top-5 2019 class that included a 5-star player, four 4-star players, and a three-star player. Picked to finish 11th in the 2018 preseason ACC poll, Mack led the Cardinals to a 20–14 season peaking at #15 in the AP polls and finishing in seventh place in the ACC standings with signature wins over #9 Michigan State, #12 North Carolina, and #11 Virginia Tech and tough losses to #5 Tennessee, Marquette, #22 Florida State, and #2 Duke. Under Mack, Louisville made only one NCAA tournament appearance.\nOn January 26, 2022, Louisville and Chris Mack mutually agreed to part ways.\nKenny Payne era (2022–2024).\nOn March 18, 2022, it was announced that the University of Louisville signed Kenny Payne to a six-year contract as head coach.\nKenny Payne ended his first season with the worst record in modern times for any Louisville team, finishing the season 4–28. \nOn March 13, 2024, Louisville fired Payne after a two-year record of 12–52.\nPat Kelsey era (2024–present).\nOn March 28, 2024, Pat Kelsey was introduced as the 23rd head coach for the Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team, signing a 5-year contract.\nNotable achievements.\nAs of the end of the 2015–16 season, Louisville had an all-time 1778–892 record in 102 seasons of intercollegiate basketball ranking 10th in all-time victories and seventh in all-time winning percentage among NCAA Division I schools. From 1944 to 1990, Louisville had an NCAA-record 46 straight winning seasons, winning 20 or more games on 31 occasions during that period.\nLouisville has made 42 NCAA Tournament appearances (5th all-time) and 15 NIT appearances. The Cardinals have reached the NCAA Tournament 32 of the last 40 years (12 of the last 15, 14 of the last 18 years, 20 of last 25). Since the NCAA began keeping Sweet Sixteen appearance records in 1975, Louisville's 21 Sweet Sixteens are 5th all-time behind North Carolina (26), Kentucky (25), Duke (24), and Kansas (22). The Cardinals have reached the Elite Eight on 14 occasions, including five of the past nine seasons. Louisville is sixth in tournament victories (75) with a 75–41 overall NCAA Tournament record, reaching the Final Four 10 times.\nLouisville is the only school in the nation to have claimed the championship of three major national post-season tournaments including the 1948 NAIA championship, the 1956 NIT title and the 1980 1986 and 2013 NCAA championships. Simultaneously, Louisville is the only school in NCAA history to have a Men's Basketball National Championship vacated, along with 2 Final Four appearances.\nPost-season results.\nNCAA tournament seeding history.\n\"The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\"\nComplete NCAA tournament results.\nThe Cardinals have appeared in the NCAA tournament 39* (43) times. Their combined record is 61–44* (76–44).\nComplete NIT results.\nThe Cardinals have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 15 times. Their combined record is 16–15. They were the 1956 NIT Champions.\nRegular season conference championships.\nThe Cardinals have won 23 conference regular season championships.\nSince the 2014–15 season they have played in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Before that, they belonged to the Kentucky Intercollegiate Athletic Conference from the 1925–26 to 1947–48 seasons, the Ohio Valley Conference for the 1948–49 season, the Missouri Valley Conference from 1964–65 to 1974–75, the Metro Conference from 1975–76 to 1994–95, Conference USA from 1995–96 to 2004–05, the Big East Conference from 2005–06 to 2012–13, and the American Athletic Conference in 2013–14.\nThey played as an independent school from 1911–12 to 1924–25 and from 1949–50 to 1963–64 (29 total seasons).\nConference tournament championships.\nThe Cardinal have won 19 conference tournament championships.\nRivalries.\nKentucky Wildcats.\nThe Kentucky–Louisville rivalry has been ranked the 2nd best rivalry in college basketball by Bleacher Report and 3rd best rivalry in all of college sports by Basketball Hall of Fame contributor Dick Vitale. Kentucky and Louisville first played against each other in 1913 but stopped playing each other in the 1920s, playing only twelve times between 1913 and 1983. The rivalry was generally dormant with only occasional matchups until the teams met in the 1983 NCAA tournament. Since then, the two teams have met each year in late December or early January.\nMuch like the Iron Bowl, the Kentucky–Louisville rivalry is all the more intense because the two schools have consistently been among the nation's elite men's basketball teams for most of the last 50 years. Both schools are also two of the most victorious programs in NCAA men's basketball history; Kentucky is #1 on the list of all-time winningest programs in Division I Men's Basketball and Louisville #26 (#10 including vacated victories). Kentucky has eight national championships while Louisville has two (officially; three including the vacated 2013 title) national championships.\nCincinnati Bearcats.\nWhile predominantly a football rivalry, the proximity and long-standing conference affiliation of Cincinnati and Louisville made this into a key rivalry, particularly in the days of the Metro and Big East conferences. This rivalry went on hiatus in 2014 when Louisville left the American Athletic Conference for the ACC.\nNotable Cardinals.\nRetired numbers.\nLouisville basketball has honored five former players by retiring their numbers. Except as noted, these are the last players to wear these numbers for a Louisville men's squad:\nCardinals in the Hall of Fame.\nLouisville has three representatives in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame: Cardinal All-American and former Washington Bullets All-Star Wes Unseld, who was inducted in 1988, former coach Denny Crum, who was inducted in 1994, and coach Rick Pitino, who was inducted in 2013. Darrell Griffith, a national player of the year and consensus All-American at the University of Louisville, is part of the 2014 induction class for the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame.\nAll-Americans.\nTwenty one Louisville players have earned 25 All American selections. 7 players received 8 consensus All-American selections.\nHonored jerseys.\nLouisville has honored the jerseys of 21 former players. Their numbers remain active.\n1000-point scorers.\n, Louisville has 67 1000-point career scorers, second only to North Carolina for most all time.\nCardinals in the pros.\nThe Cardinals have had 75 players taken in the NBA draft, the most recent being Ray Spalding, who was chosen in the 2018 NBA draft, and Donovan Mitchell, who was chosen in the 2017 NBA draft. 30 former Cardinal players are playing professional basketball, with six of those currently playing in the NBA.\nSeveral other former players have played in the NBA, including:\nFacilities.\nHome courts.\nKFC Yum! Center (2010–present).\nSince the 2010–11 season the Cardinals have played their home games at the KFC Yum! Center located along the banks of the Ohio River in downtown Louisville. , Louisville has a 114–14 record () in 6 seasons in the KFC Yum! Center.\nThe facility has a seating capacity of 22,090 with 71 suites and 62 loge boxes. It is the third-largest in the nation (behind only Syracuse's Carrier Dome, Tennessee's Thompson Boling Arena, and Kentucky's Rupp Arena). Louisville ranked among the top 3 in attendance in the first three seasons at the KFC Yum! Center. The attendance record of 22,815 was set on March 9, 2013, against #24 Notre Dame.\nThe playing surface at the KFC Yum! Center is named Denny Crum Court in honor of Hall of Fame coach Denny Crum. The University of Louisville first renamed its home court after Crum in January 2007.\nSince the opening of the KFC Yum Center, the University of Louisville has become the most valuable college basketball team in the nation. In 2012 the Cardinals were worth $36.1 million, up nearly 40% from two years earlier, before the Yum Center opened.\nFreedom Hall (1956–2010).\nFrom 1956 to the completion of the KFC Yum! Center in 2010, the Cardinals played their home games at Freedom Hall. Louisville had a 664–136 record in 54 seasons in Freedom Hall (.83 winning percentage). Freedom Hall has been the site of six NCAA Final Fours, four additional NCAA events and 10 conference tournaments. ESPN College Basketball magazine once named Freedom Hall as the nation's \"Best Playing Floor.\"\nLouisville ranked among the top 10 nationally in average home attendance at Freedom Hall for 31 years, including the last 28 in the nation's top five (19,397 in 2009–10, third in the nation). In 2010, a new Freedom Hall attendance record was set when 20,135 fans witnessed the Cardinals defeat the #1 ranked Syracuse Orange in the final University of Louisville game in the arena.\nJefferson County Armory (1945–1972).\nJefferson County Armory was the primary home of Louisville Cardinals basketball starting in 1945 when Bernard \"Peck\" Hickman was head coach until the 1957–58 season, when Freedom Hall became their primary home game site. The Cardinals played 10 of their home games in the Jefferson County Armory in 1956–57 and three games in Freedom Hall. Louisville played one game at the armory in 1958–59.In the 1960s the armory was renamed the Louisville Convention Center. The Cardinals played two games at the Convention Center in 1963–64 and three games in the Convention Center in 1964–65. The last game the Cardinals played there was November 30, 1972. Louisville was 153–23 all time at the Jefferson County Armory which is now named the Louisville Gardens.\nBelknap Gymnasium (1931–1944).\nAfter playing home games at numerous venues in its early years, the Cardinals moved to the newly constructed Belknap Gymnasium in 1931. The gym housed 600 bleacher seats and the baskets were mounted directly to the wall. Louisville compiled a 56–35 (.615 winning percentage) before moving to the Jefferson County Armory. The gym was razed in 1993 to make way for Lutz Hall.\nPractice facilities.\nPlanet Fitness-Kueber Center (2007–present).\nSince 2007 the Cardinals have practiced at the $15.2 million, Planet Fitness-Kueber Center on campus. The Planet Fitness-Kueber Center houses the teams basketball offices, practice facilities, film room and training areas.\nThe facility was named the Yum! Center, until December 2018 when local businessmen Rick and David Kueber donated $3 million to rename the facility.\nControversies and scandals.\n1956 recruiting violations.\nIn 1956 the team was placed on probation for two years by the NCAA, including bans on postseason play, due to recruiting violations.\n2015 sex scandal.\nA former Louisville player, and then Director of Basketball Operations, Andre McGee, arranged and paid for strippers and prostitutes to perform striptease dances and sexual acts for 17 prospective and former basketball players from 2010 to 2014. On October 3, 2015, the book publisher IBJ Custom Publishing released a book entitled \"Breaking Cardinal Rules.\" Based on revelations provided by the local self-described escort, Katina Powell, the book detailed striptease dances and acts of prostitution that Powell and McGee arranged and organized in Minardi Hall over approximately a four-year period.\nDuring the investigation of the allegations, the university self-imposed a ban on the 2016 NCAA tournament. In June 2016, the NCAA announced that the university would lose four basketball scholarships over the course of four seasons, but there would be no further postseason ban. The NCAA suspended head coach Rick Pitino for five ACC games during the 2017–18 season. The NCAA also ordered the university to vacate all wins from 2011 to 2014 that include ineligible players. The vacated wins include a Final Four appearance in 2012 and an NCAA Tournament Championship in 2013. Luke Hancock's 2013 Final Four Most Valuable Player Award was reinstated by the NCAA because he was found to be innocent of any NCAA rule violations.\n2017–18 NCAA corruption scandal.\nAs a result of a corruption scandal implicating various schools including Louisville, on September 27, 2017, Louisville placed head coach Rick Pitino on unpaid administrative leave and athletic director Tom Jurich on paid administrative leave. Rick Pitino and Tom Jurich would then be fired with cause by the university. Two days later, assistant David Padgett, a former star player under Pitino at Louisville, was named as acting head coach."

        "title": "Legion of Doom (ice hockey)",
        "text": "The Legion of Doom was a forward line for the Philadelphia Flyers who played together between 1995 and 1997 comprising centre Eric Lindros, left winger John LeClair and right winger Mikael Renberg. They were given this name not only for their offensive play, but also their ability to dominate games physically; each of the three were six foot two or taller and weighed over 230 pounds. The name was coined by journeyman Flyers centre Jim Montgomery and popularized by Flyers announcer Gene Hart.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nIn the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons, Mark Recchi (jersey #8), Lindros (#88) and Brent Fedyk (#18) had formed the productive \"Crazy Eights\" line. Renberg split his time playing left wing with Lindros and right wing with Rod Brind'Amour. Despite a strong start to the 1993–94 season, and emergent talents such as Lindros and Renberg, the Flyers fell apart in the second half of the year and narrowly missed the playoffs, the fifth consecutive time that the club didn't reach the postseason. This led to the firing of head coach Terry Simpson and general manager Russ Farwell. They were succeeded by Terry Murray and Bobby Clarke, respectively.\nFormation.\nThe line was formed in the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season when the Montreal Canadiens traded John LeClair, Eric Desjardins, and Gilbert Dionne to the Flyers in exchange for Mark Recchi. Renberg was moved from Rod Brind'Amour's left wing and placed on Lindros' right wing. Murray then placed LeClair as the left wing to form the trio. LeClair was expected to use his physical prowess to make room for Lindros, and went on to exceed all expectations as LeClair's scoring totals jumped dramatically compared with his time with the Canadiens.\nThe line registered its first point on Saturday, February 11, 1995, in a game against the New Jersey Devils at the Meadowlands Sports Complex. The line made an immediate impact, as it helped the Flyers defeat the Devils 3–1. Before the formation of the line, the Flyers had struggled out of the gate, going only 3–7–1 through their first 11 games while being outscored 34–22. However, in their final 37 games (including the one on February 11 against the Devils), the Flyers went 25–9–3 and outscored their opponents 128–98 en route to capturing the Atlantic Division title and an appearance in the Eastern Conference Finals (a six-game loss to the Devils).\nThe Legion went on to score 80 goals and collect 96 assists that season for Philadelphia. Eric Lindros, with a total of 70 points, tied the Pittsburgh Penguins' Jaromir Jagr for the scoring lead that season, but the Art Ross Trophy was given to Jagr as he had 32 goals to Lindros' 29. Lindros, however, was named the league MVP, winning the Hart Memorial Trophy and the Lester B. Pearson Award. Both Lindros and LeClair earned NHL First-Team All-Star honours.\n1995–96 season.\nThe line stayed together for the 1995–96 season, which would turn out to be their most productive, as they scored 121 goals and picked up 134 assists.\n1997 Stanley Cup Finals.\nTheir last season together was 1996–97, where they scored 104 goals and collected 131 assists. The Legion's offensive production was down due to injuries to Renberg.\nThey also led the Philadelphia Flyers to the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals, collecting 26 goals and 32 assists in their play-off run, as they beat the Pittsburgh Penguins, Buffalo Sabres, and New York Rangers in five games each.\nHowever, they were upset by the Detroit Red Wings, who swept them four games to none. Detroit head coach Scotty Bowman surprised Flyers head coach Terry Murray by using the finesse-oriented defense pairing of Nicklas Lidström and Larry Murphy, rather than the rugged Vladimir Konstantinov, against the Legion of Doom. Lidstrom and Murphy's puckhandling abilities helped them neutralize Philadelphia's vaunted forechecking. LeClair and Lindros only scored one goal each during the Finals series; LeClair scored the Flyers' only goal as they lost 6–1 in Game 3, while Lindros finally managed to put the puck in the net during the dying seconds of Game 4 to cut the Wings' lead to 2–1.\nBreakup.\nTerry Murray's contract as head coach was not renewed due to accusing his team of choking during a closed-door meeting with his players following their 6–1 loss in Game 3 of the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals, which exposed the fragile confidence of the team, though he remained with the Flyers as a pro scout and later as an assistant coach.\nThe line would be broken up in the 1997 off-season, as Philadelphia dealt Renberg in exchange for Chris Gratton. Lindros and LeClair still played on the same line for the next three seasons, with players such as Keith Jones at right-wing. Later Renberg would return to Philadelphia for exactly the same trade which would send Gratton back to the Tampa Bay Lightning. Although Renberg returned, the original Legion of Doom did not, for Renberg could never make it past the third forward line.\nMark Recchi returned to the Flyers midway through the 1998–99 season and again became the team's leading scorer. Lindros missed the end of the 1999–2000 season with a concussion, so the Flyers traded for Keith Primeau who played a physical forward role similar to Lindros, as Lindros only returned at the end of the playoffs. That turned out to be his last game with the Flyers, as he held out the following season over a contract dispute and he was sent to the New York Rangers for 2001–02. John LeClair was bought out by the Flyers following the 2004–05 NHL lockout and signed with the Pittsburgh Penguins.\nOn December 31, 2011, Lindros and LeClair played as \"two thirds\" of the Legion of Doom at the Philadelphia Flyers and New York Rangers alumni game in Philadelphia at Citizen's Bank Park.\nOn January 14, 2017 all three members of the Legion of Doom played together for the first time since Renberg's trade during the Flyers alumni game against the Penguins alumni."

        "title": "Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball",
        "text": "The Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball team represents the University of Alabama in NCAA Division I men's basketball. The program plays in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). In the conference it trails only long-time basketball powerhouse Kentucky in SEC tournament titles, is third behind Kentucky and Arkansas in total wins, and is third behind Kentucky and Tennessee in SEC regular season conference titles. Alabama was retroactively recognized as the pre-NCAA tournament national champion for the 1929–30 season by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. The team has appeared in the NCAA tournament 24 times, most recently in 2024, and has made ten Sweet Sixteens, two Elite Eights, and one Final Four in the tournament. Alabama's current head coach is Nate Oats.\nThe men's basketball program has spent most of its history in the shadow of Alabama's football team, but has risen in stature over the past several decades. The program was notable as a regular conference basketball contender in the 1980s and early 1990s under the direction of coach Wimp Sanderson and in the 1970s under coach C. M. Newton. Under former coach Mark Gottfried, the team achieved a No. 1 national ranking briefly in 2003. In the 2003–04 season, the team defeated #1-seeded Stanford in the NCAA tournament, and reached the Elite Eight round for the first time where they lost to the eventual national champion, Connecticut.\nUnder Nate Oats, the team earned SEC titles in 2021 and 2023. In the latter year, the Crimson Tide achieved their best-ever season in program history to that point, earning the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA tournament. They fell to the eventual runner-up, San Diego State, in the Sweet Sixteen. In the 2024 NCAA tournament, they defeated #1-seeded North Carolina in the Sweet Sixteen, and defeated #6-seeded Clemson in the Elite Eight to advance to their first Final Four appearance in the school's history where they lost to the eventual national champion, UConn.\nHistory.\nFormer coaches with at least five years with the Crimson Tide include the following: Hank Crisp (1923–1942, 1945–1946), Hayden Riley (1960–1968), C. M. Newton (1968–1980), Wimp Sanderson (1980–1992) – Alabama's winningest coach (.692), David Hobbs (1992–1998), Mark Gottfried (1998–2009), and Anthony Grant (2009–2015).\nOther coaches include John Dee, D.V. Graves, Floyd Burdette, and Charles A. Bernier.\nC. M. Newton.\nIn 1968, legendary Alabama football coach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant, who was also Alabama's athletic director, called Kentucky men's basketball coach Adolph Rupp looking for someone to turn around Alabama's basketball program. Rupp recommended C. M. Newton, a former backup player at Kentucky who had been at Transylvania University for 12 years. In 12 seasons at Alabama, Newton led the Tide to a record of 211–123. The Crimson Tide won three straight SEC titles under Newton (1974, 1975, and 1976), the only program besides Kentucky to accomplish this feat. Newton also guided Alabama to four NIT and two NCAA Men's Division I Championship tournament berths, prompting the school to name a recruiting suite in his honor in 2006.\nJust as he did at Transylvania, Newton recruited Alabama's first black player, Wendell Hudson, in 1969, integrating his second team in as many coaching stops.\nWimp Sanderson.\nNewton resigned as head coach after the 1980–81 season to become assistant commissioner of the SEC. He was succeeded by his top assistant, Wimp Sanderson. He had been at Alabama since 1960 as a graduate assistant to Newton's predecessor, Hayden Riley; he was named a full-fledged assistant in 1961. In 12 years as head coach his teams averaged 21.8 wins a year, with a 267–119 record, and they won 4 SEC tournaments. They played in one NIT and eight NCAA tournaments making the \"Sweet 16\" five times. Sanderson is the only coach in Alabama history to win 200 or more games in his first 10 years. He was the SEC Coach of the Year in 1987, 1989 and 1990, and was the National Coach of the Year in 1987.\nSanderson was best known for wearing garish plaid sports jackets on the sidelines. At one point, Coleman Coliseum was known as the \"Plaid Palace\", and the mid-court logo was painted in a crimson-and-white plaid pattern.\nDavid Hobbs.\nHobbs was hired at Alabama as an assistant coach for Wimp Sanderson in 1985 and spent seven years as an assistant in Tuscaloosa helping the Crimson Tide win one SEC Championship and four SEC Tournament crowns while the Tide made four appearances in the NCAA tournament's Sweet 16. As an assistant, he had the opportunity to coach such All-SEC performers as Robert Horry, James \"Hollywood\" Robinson and Latrell Sprewell.\nWhen Sanderson left Alabama following the 1992 season, Hobbs was named head coach. In his first season, the Tide finished 16–13 and advanced to the NIT. In 1994 and 1995, Alabama recorded 20-win seasons and advanced to the NCAA tournament behind the play of future NBA All-Star Antonio McDyess. In 1996, Hobbs led UA to a 19–13 mark and a berth in the NIT Final Four. He resigned his post following the 1998 season after compiling a 110–76 (.594) career record and producing nine All-SEC players.\nMark Gottfried.\nMark Gottfried served as the Crimson Tide's head coach from the 1998–99 season until midway through the 2008–09 season. Gottfried played 3 seasons of basketball at Alabama under Wimp Sanderson, and the Crimson Tide advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in each of those seasons. He was hired by Alabama in March 1998 after coaching at Murray State for three seasons.\nThe Crimson Tide achieved the highest pinnacle ever for the school in both the NCAA Championship tournament and the Associated Press Poll reaching the Elite Eight in the tournament in 2004 and reaching the No. 1 spot in the nation in the AP poll in 2002, both under Mark Gottfried's command.\nGottfried led the Tide to its only SEC Championship under his watch during the 2001–02 season, although the team never won a conference tournament championship during his tenure. For his efforts in 2002, Gottfried was named SEC Coach of the Year by both the Associated Press and his fellow Southeastern Conference coaches. Perhaps his biggest accomplishment as coach at Alabama was leading the Crimson Tide to five consecutive NCAA tournaments from 2002 to 2006, another first for the school that occurred under his watch.\nGottfried resigned on January 26, 2009, with 11 regular season games still remaining on the team's schedule. Then Athletic Director Mal Moore named long-time Alabama assistant and former player, Philip Pearson as interim head coach for the remainder of the 2008–09 season.\nAnthony Grant.\nOn March 27, 2009 Anthony Grant agreed in principle to become the 20th Crimson Tide head men's basketball coach. Grant came to Alabama after serving as the head coach at VCU from 2006 to 2009.\nAfter a mediocre first season, Grant led the veteran 2010–11 team to a SEC West title and a 2nd-place finish in the 2011 NIT. The 2011–12 team endured the suspensions of several star players to finish with a 21–12 record and a berth in the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, where they lost in the round of 64 to Creighton. This was the Crimson Tide's first trip to the NCAA tournament since 2006. In March 2015, Grant was fired by Alabama after six seasons. Assistant coach John Brannen served as interim head coach for the 2015 NIT tournament.\nAvery Johnson.\nOn April 5, 2015, Avery Johnson agreed to become Alabama's next head coach. The former NBA coach said he was attracted to the position because he perceived it as \"a big challenge\" in that Alabama is not a \"perennial favorite\" and has never won a championship before. Johnson's 2017–18 team finished with a 20–16 (8–10) record and was invited to the NCAA tournament. The next season, the Tide finished 18–16 (8–10) and Johnson was let go at the end of the campaign.\nNate Oats.\nOn March 27, 2019, Nate Oats was named Alabama's next head coach. Oats was previously the coach for the Buffalo Bulls, and had led them to three NCAA tournament appearances in the past four years. After a 16–15 record in his first season in 2019–20, Oats' second season brought Alabama the first SEC regular-season title since 2002 and the first SEC tournament title since 1991. The Tide were a No. 2 seed in the 2021 tournament, where they fell to UCLA in overtime in the Sweet Sixteen. Then in 2023, Oats coached Alabama to their second SEC regular season and tournament championship in three years. Alabama returned as the No. 1 overall seed in the 2023 NCAA tournament where they advanced to the Sweet Sixteen for the second time under Oats tenure before falling to San Diego State who advanced to the National Championship game.\nIn 2024, Alabama once again made the NCAA tournament and advanced to their second Elite Eight in program history after defeating North Carolina in the Sweet Sixteen. Bama beat Clemson in the West Region finals to advance to the Final Four for the first time in program history.\nOats also holds the best record against AP top 10 teams in Alabama history.\nArena.\nThe Crimson Tide basketball team practices and plays in Coleman Coliseum, a multi-purpose arena on the UA campus in Tuscaloosa. The arena was built for $4.2 million and opened in 1968 as a replacement for the aging Foster Auditorium. In 2005, the building underwent a renovation in which more seats were added. The arena officially seats 15,314 people.\nColeman Coliseum was named for Jefferson Jackson Coleman, a prominent alumnus and longtime supporter of the University of Alabama. Until his death in 1995, he was the only person that had attended every Alabama football bowl game, starting with the Rose Bowl Game on January 1, 1926. Prior to 1990, the building was known as \"Memorial Coliseum\".\nFan support.\nMark's Madness.\n\"Mark's Madness\" was a student organization named after former Crimson Tide coach Mark Gottfried, which is also a play on the nickname for the NCAA basketball tournament, \"March Madness\". It was created by a group of Alabama students in January 2000 in an attempt to create a more exciting atmosphere in Coleman Coliseum. During the Gottfried era, the Crimson Tide was an impressive 137-27 (.835) in Coleman Coliseum. Mark's Madness was the largest student organization on campus during its time. The end of Mark Gottfried's tenure in early 2009 also meant the end of the Mark's Madness name.\nCrimson Chaos.\nAfter Coach Anthony Grant was hired, a group of senior students approached the UA Marketing Department in the summer 2009 about resurrecting the student section organization. During the first exhibition game of the 2009 season, it was announced that the new name of the student organization for supporting Alabama basketball would be \"Crimson Chaos\".\nAs Crimson Chaos entered its second year, it officially registered as a University of Alabama student group and adopted a new format. In addition to supporting men's basketball, Crimson Chaos expanded to support all University of Alabama sports, becoming the official student group of athletics at the university. The group also tried new things to make the atmosphere in Coleman Coliseum as intimidating as it was in previous years, including adding the \"Roll Tide Roller Coaster\". The newly energized environment Crimson Chaos created in Coleman Coliseum helped the Tide complete an undefeated season at home (for the 2010–11 season) with a 19–0 record, including wins over then #12 Kentucky, Georgia, Mississippi State.\nThe group's popularity garnered even more attention and praise thanks to the late superfan Luke “Fluff” Ratliff. He became the Crimson Chaos president and wore a plaid jacket to almost every game. He was loved by many for his light hearted humor and happy-go-lucky attitude. He inspired many people to follow and share in his passion for the tide hoops program and also other athletic teams around campus. He sparked the basketball program under Coach Nate Oats and continues to be an inspiration to so many. There is a plaque engraved to honor Fluff in the dedicated chair for all Crimson Chaos Presidents who come after him.\nPost-season results.\nNCAA tournament.\nAlabama has appeared in the NCAA tournament 24 times. It has reached the Sweet Sixteen ten times, the Elite Eight twice, and the Final Four once. Alabama has an overall NCAA tournament record of 29–25.\nNIT appearances.\nAlabama has appeared in 16 National Invitation Tournaments, reaching the championship game on two occasions.

        "text": "David Wilson Boswell (January 20, 1945 – June 11, 2012) was an American right-handed pitcher who spent eight seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), all in the American League (AL), with the Minnesota Twins (1964–1970), Detroit Tigers, and Baltimore Orioles (both in 1971). He won twenty games as a starting pitcher during the 1969 season, the only time he achieved the feat during his major league career.\nBoswell graduated from Calvert Hall College High School in 1963. He drew the interest of several major league teams. One was the hometown Orioles who had ranked him and Wally Bunker as the two best pitching prospects in the country. Not able to afford giving each of them huge signing bonuses, the ballclub only signed Bunker after being disappointed by Boswell's performance during his senior year. Boswell eventually signed with the Twins for US$15,000. Even though the New York Yankees had offered the same amount of money, he decided that his chances to make the majors were better with Minnesota.\nAfter debuting with the Twins in 1965, Boswell pitched for the Twins in the team's World Series loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers. In 1966, Boswell's winning percentage (based on a 12–5 record) led the American League. Following a 1969 game against the Detroit Tigers, Boswell got into a fight with teammate Bob Allison and Manager Billy Martin outside the Lindell AC bar near Tiger Stadium. After knocking out Allison with one punch, Boswell was in turn knocked out by Martin, resulting in a cut that required 20 stitches. Despite the off-field injury, Boswell would win 20 games in 1969, helping the Twins win the American League West.\nDuring the American League Championship Series, Boswell lost 1–0 in 11 innings to Baltimore Orioles pitcher Dave McNally. He later revealed that he had suffered a career-ending arm injury during the game on a slider thrown to strike out slugger Frank Robinson in the bottom of the 10th. \nAfter being released by the Twins following the 1970 season, Boswell briefly played for the Detroit Tigers and the Baltimore Orioles during the 1971 season.\nBoswell was the losing pitcher in Catfish Hunter's perfect game on May 8, 1968. \nBoswell was a good hitting pitcher, posting a .202 batting average (74-for-367) with 41 runs, 4 home runs and 22 RBIs.\nBoswell died of a heart attack at his Joppatowne, Maryland, home on June 11, 2012."

        "text": "The Texas A&amp;M Aggies men's basketball team represents Texas A&amp;M University in NCAA Division I college basketball. The Aggies compete in the Southeastern Conference. Since 1998, the teams has played its home games at Reed Arena, a 12,989-capacity arena in College Station, Texas on the campus of Texas A&amp;M University. Texas A&amp;M has appeared in the NCAA tournament 16 times, most recently in 2024. The Aggies are currently coached by Buzz Williams who was hired on April 3, 2019, prior to the start of the 2019–2020 season.\nHistory.\nMetcalf era.\nShelby Metcalf took over the A&amp;M basketball program in 1963. His impact was immediate, winning the Southwest Conference with a 13–1 conference record for Texas A&amp;M's first title in 13 years. In his 26 years as head coach at Texas A&amp;M, he won six Southwest Conference titles, two Southwest Conference tournament titles, and led A&amp;M to six NCAA Tournament and four NIT appearances. He was fired by former A&amp;M football player and then-athletic director John David Crow after coaching 19 games of the 1989–1990 season. When asked by the media what happened between the two, Metcalf remarked, \"I made a comment that I didn't think John David was all that bright. And I thought I was being generous.\" Metcalf finished his career at A&amp;M with an overall record of 438–306, making him the all-time winningest men's basketball coach in Southwest Conference history.\nThe Dark Ages.\nAfter Metcalf was fired, A&amp;M went through the next 14 years making only one postseason appearance (1994 NIT), finished above .500 in conference play only twice, and posted an overall record of .500 or above only twice. John Thornton finished out the 1990 season as head coach after Metcalf was fired. Soon after, Kermit Davis, Jr. was hired prior to the 1990–91 season, after posting a 50–12 () record in two seasons at Idaho. He resigned after one season at 8–21 and Texas A&amp;M began investigating recruiting violations by Davis. He was soon placed on a two-year probation by the NCAA and coached at a community college in Florida. Tony Barone was hired from Creighton in 1991 to replace Davis. Barone lasted seven years as head coach of the program, finishing below .500 six times. It was in 1994 that he finished with a 10–4 league record for 2nd place in the Southwest Conference and was invited to the NIT. After Barone finished last in the Big 12 Conference in 1998, Melvin Watkins was hired out of UNC-Charlotte. While a good recruiter, Watkins never finished above seventh in the Big 12. He resigned after going winless (0–16) in conference play in 2004.\nSince 2004.\nGillispie era.\nAfter Watkins resigned, Billy Gillispie, was hired out of UTEP after leading the Miners to an NCAA Tournament appearance and having the largest turnaround of any team in the nation, from 6–24 in 2002–03 to 24–8 in 2003–04. The Aggies, though picked by Big 12 coaches to finish last in the conference, immediately improved under Gillispie, winning their first 10 games and finishing at 21–10, 8–8 in conference. Along the way, the team defeated ranked, in-state rivals Texas and Texas Tech. The team earned an NIT bid, Texas A&amp;M's first postseason in 11 years, reaching the quarterfinals of the tournament.\nGillispie's second year featured further improvement, with the Aggies defeating three ranked opponents in Colorado, Texas, and Syracuse. The team finished with a league record of 10–6 and a win in the Big 12 Tournament, Texas A&amp;M's first since the conference first began play in 1996–97. The Aggies reached the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1987 as a 12-seed, upsetting fifth-seed Syracuse in the first round. The Aggies fell in the second round to LSU on the final shot of the game.\nIn the 2006–07 season, A&amp;M started ranked at #13. Despite early-season losses to LSU and UCLA, the Aggies were able to secure a win at Allen Fieldhouse over #6 Kansas, a first for a Big 12 South team since the conference was formed. They finished with just three losses in conference play (a sweep by Texas Tech and a double-overtime loss to a Kevin Durant-led Texas in Austin) and were able to secure the #2 seed in the Big 12 tournament. The Aggies lost in the quarterfinals to Oklahoma State. They received a #3 seed in the 2007 NCAA championship tournament, their highest seed ever, and reached the Sweet 16. In the postseason, A&amp;M achieved a #9 ranking by the Associated Press and ESPN/USA Today coaches polls, the highest ranking ever attained in school history. In this season, they were the only program in the Big 12 Conference to have both men's and women's teams competing in the NCAA Tournament – the men as a #3 seed and the women as a #4 seed.\nOn April 6, 2007, Gillispie resigned his position as head coach at Texas A&amp;M to coach at the University of Kentucky. Four days later, on April 10, Mark Turgeon, head coach of Wichita State University, was announced as the new men's basketball head coach at A&amp;M.\nTurgeon era.\nUnder Turgeon and his staff from 2007 to 2011, the Aggies had their greatest four year win total in program history. The Aggies started the 2007–08 season ranked 14th in the preseason Coaches Poll. Once the season progressed, they won the 2007 NIT Season Tip-Off to extend their winning streak to 7–0. Their first loss of the season came to unranked Arizona. After the Arizona game, they would then win eight straight home games against unranked opponents. Team performance spiraled down once conference play had begun, losing to three straight unranked teams—at Texas Tech, at Michael Beasley-led Kansas State, and at home to Baylor in a 5-overtime classic. The Aggies would post wins at their next five matchups, including one over the 10th-ranked rival Texas Longhorns and three away games. They then regressed, losing to Oklahoma State and Nebraska at home. Another high point came when they defeated Texas Tech 98–54 at home, matching their highest margin of victory in school history (set in 1959 against Texas). The Aggies regressed once again, this time losing 64–37 at Oklahoma. After the blowout, the Aggies were able to revenge Baylor in Waco, though came back home to lose their final regular season game to eventual national champion Kansas to finish the season at 8–8 in conference play. The team received a No. 6 bid to the Big 12 tournament, defeating Iowa State and Kansas State in the first two rounds, but lost to Kansas again in the semifinals. With their 24–10 record after the Big 12 tournament, the Aggies received a No. 9 at-large bid to the West Regional of the NCAA tournament. In the first round, they defeated 8th-seeded BYU 67–62 at Anaheim. In the second round, they faced UCLA at the same site, though allowed them to escape with a close 51–49 win. The Aggies finished the season with a 25–11 record. The 25 wins matches the record for most wins by a first-year coach at a Big 12 school, set by former Texas coach Tom Penders in the 1988–89 season.\nThe 2008–09 Aggies, led by Turgeon in his second year, went 14–1 in non-conference play, with wins over Alabama, Arizona, and LSU; the one loss was handed to them by Tulsa. Josh Carter and Bryan Davis received preseason Big 12 honorable mention. The team did not make the top 25 of the preseason AP or Coaches polls, though received votes. During the 2009 signing period, the Aggies signed Naji Hibbert, Khris Middleton, Kourtney Roberson, and Ray Turner, all of whom were listed in the Rivals.com Top 150 prospects for the class of 2009. The Aggies went 9–7 in Big 12 play to make the NCAA tournament for the fourth straight year; they defeated BYU in the first round for the second consecutive year before losing to UConn. Josh Carter became an All-Big 12 Third Team selection, while Derrick Roland was selected to the Big 12 All-Defensive Team. The Aggies finished 24–10, giving Turgeon 49 wins over two years.\nIn the 2009–10 season, the Aggies played a considerably tougher non-conference schedule, going 10–3. Senior guard Derrick Roland broke his leg grotesquely in December and missed the rest of the season. The team was picked to finish fifth in the Big 12 in the preseason coaches' poll but finished tied for second. With their 22–8 regular-season finish and 11–5 mark in conference play, the Aggies participated in the 2010 Big 12 Tournament and defeated Nebraska before losing to No. 1 Kansas in the semifinals. They received an at–large bid to the NCAA tournament and earned a 5 seed in the South Region. They defeated 12 seed Utah State in the first round before falling to 4 seed Purdue in overtime in the second round to finish their season at 24–10. Donald Sloan made All-Big 12 First Team as a senior and Bryan Davis was named to the All-Big 12 Defensive team; they graduated with 100 wins, the most by any class in Aggie basketball history. Turgeon's 73 wins at the conclusion of the season surpassed Gillispie's 70 in three years at A&amp;M.\nPrior to the beginning of his last year at Texas A&amp;M, Turgeon had negotiated a contract extension and salary increase, but he was growing more unhappy with the Aggie fanbase. During his final season coaching the Aggies Turgeon publicly express unhappiness with the inconsistent fan support from both students and public ticket holders. On the evening of May 9, 2011 at 8pm (local time), Turgeon met with his coaching staff and players to inform them that half an hour earlier he accepted the head coach position at the University of Maryland. He had visited the campus earlier that day and left with an offer. When asked about his decision at an Aggie Athletics press conference he said \"Maryland's got a great basketball tradition. [Texas A&amp;M and Maryland are] real similar. It's a gut feeling.\" In their meeting earlier that night he told the Aggie players \"it was the hardest decision [he] ever had to make... because of [them].\" Turgeon said that fan attendance at A&amp;M did not factor into his decision.\nKennedy Era.\nFollowing the 2010 season, Mark Turgeon left the Texas Aggies for the University of Maryland, opening the door for Billy Kennedy to become the new head coach of the team. Kennedy, who arrived after coaching at Murray State, was known for his good coaching record for the Racers his final years there.\nKennedy's first three years at Texas A&amp;M began as a slow progression in terms of quality of the teams, going 14-18, 18–15, and 18–16 respectively, with his 3rd year team being invited to the annual end-of-year CBI basketball tournament.\nThe 2014–15 season saw the Aggies vie for a spot in the NCAA tournament, but the team lost 4 of their last 5 games, so they were instead invited to the NIT. They finished the season with a record of 21–12.\nHis next year saw one of the best years in Aggie men's basketball in nearly a decade, with the team winning a share the conference regular season title. The Aggies were invited to the NCAA tournament as a 3 seed, and played all the way to the Sweet Sixteen, where they were eventually defeated by Oklahoma, finishing the season with a record of 28–9.\nThe next year was considered by many to be a rebuilding year, as 4 starting seniors were graduating, with 3 heading for the NBA: Danuel House, Alex Caruso, and Jalen Jones. The team, which was led by mostly sophomores, went on to finish the season with a record of 16–15, and were not invited to any postseason tournaments for the first time since 2013.\nThe following year, the Aggies returned most of their starters from the previous year, now as mostly juniors, and began the season with a lot of promise, landing a No. 25 spot in the preseason AP poll and reaching as high as No. 5 during the regular season. After a string of injuries and suspensions, the team hobbled to the end of the season, but not without landing a spot in the NCAA tournament. Earning a 7 seed, the team went on to defeat Providence and the defending national champions, North Carolina, to earn a spot in the Sweet Sixteen, their 2nd in 3 years. The team would lose to Michigan in the Sweet Sixteen, and finish the season with a record of 22–13. Sophomore starting center Robert Williams, as well as juniors Tyler Davis and D. J. Hogg would then declare for the NBA draft.\nThe next year was the worst year the Aggies had under Kennedy as head coach since his first one. The departure of 3 starters to the NBA draft as well as senior Admon Gilder to a season ending illness/injury before the season began did not bode well for the upcoming season. This was further stressed when the only returning starter from the previous season, TJ Starks, got a season-ending injury midway through conference play. With only 7 scholarship players left the Aggies fought hard with the addition of 2 walk-ons taking TJ's place- Mark French and Chris Collins. The Aggies finished the season 14–18. Kennedy was fired following the conclusion of the season.\nBuzz Era.\nFollowing Kennedy's firing by Scott Woodward, the Aggies hired Virginia Tech men's basketball coach Buzz Williams on April 3, 2019, following the Hokies loss to Duke in the Sweet 16 of the 2019 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. The Aggies were picked to place 12th in the SEC preseason poll and began the season with a rough stretch, including losses to Temple and Fairfield. However, the team would eventually find its rhythm in its stifling defense, finishing the regular season with an overall record of 16–14, 10–8 in the SEC, the most wins since the 2016 Sweet Sixteen season and placing them in a tie for 6th in the conference. However, before any postseason play could begin, the season was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020-21 season was marred by injury and illness, finishing with a record of 8–10, 2–8 in SEC play. The 2021-2022 season started with promise as A&amp;M began SEC play 4-0 but hit a rough patch, losing 8 conference games in a row. However, the Aggies would catch fire late in the season, winning 8 of their final 9 games. A&amp;M would enter the SEC Tournament, where they would upset #1 seed and SEC Regular Season Champions Auburn, and an Arkansas team that many considered one of the hottest teams in the country. The Aggies would lose to Tennessee in the tournament final, costing the team a spot in the NCAA Tournament. They went on to play for the NIT championship where they lost to Xavier 73-72.\nTop 25 poll finishes.\nThe AP Poll first appeared on January 20, 1949, and has since been published continuously. The Coaches' Poll began selecting the top 20 teams on a weekly basis during the 1950–1951 college basketball season. It was initially published by United Press from 1950 through 1990, followed by USA Today/CNN from 1991 through 1996, and USA Today/ESPN from 1997 through 2004, and USA Today from 2005 to the present.

        "text": "Victor Bernard King Jr. (born July 24, 1981) is an American professional basketball player for UJAP Quimper 29 of the LNB Pro B. He played college basketball for Texas A&amp;M University.\nKing holds numerous Big 12 Conference and Texas A&amp;M records. King left A&amp;M as the top scorer in Big 12 conference history, as well as third in the league for all-time career assists. He led the Aggies in scoring and assists in all four of his seasons, and ranks among Texas A&amp;M's all-time leaders in points (first), three-point field goals made (first), and assists (second).\nEarly years.\nBernard King was born in Gibsland, Louisiana, the son of Victor King, a former Louisiana Tech basketball player and second-round NBA draft pick by the Los Angeles Lakers from Newellton, Louisiana and Vernita King. From the time young Bernard learned to walk, he would accompany his father to the gym, and began to express an interest in playing with the basketball too.\nWhen he was eight, King's parents brought him to basketball camps run by Louisiana Tech and the Dallas Mavericks. Organizers of those camps realized quickly that King played at a much higher level than others in his age group, and recommended that he instead play in the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU). By the time he was in eighth grade, King was playing alongside high-school juniors and seniors. When given the opportunity to play in place of a guard who had fouled out, King sank three three-pointers in a row, helping his team to win the game. As a 14-year-old, he played on an AAU team for 17-year-olds, scoring six three-pointers in one game in the state playoffs before helping the team to win a national championship.\nKing played with the varsity all four years of his career at Gibsland-Coleman Complex High School, helping them to a 143–34 record in that time period. In his career, he accumulated 4,018 points, more than 1,000 rebounds, and 1348 assists. In his senior year, King averaged 28.9 points, 8.3 rebounds, 11.2 assists, 5.4 steals, and 3.7 blocks, leading the team to the state championship, the school's first since 1984. He earned 1998 AAU All-America honors, and was named Louisiana Mr. Basketball by the Louisiana Sports Writers Association. Despite the time involved in maintaining his dual basketball careers, King made sure to devote enough time to his academic career, graduating from high school with a 3.8 GPA.\nBob Gibbons named King the 33rd best prospect in the country, and almost every major recruiting service ranked him as one of the top 75 prospects. Although he was recruited by Purdue University, University of Minnesota, Seton Hall, LSU, University of Wyoming, and Tulane University, King chose to attend Texas A&amp;M University to play under coach Melvin Watkins and attempt to turn around the program.\nCollege career.\nAs a freshman at Texas A&amp;M, King started in all 28 games and averaged 16.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game. He led the Aggies in scoring, assists, blocks (0.6), and three-point field goals (79), and ranked second on the team in rebounding, steals (1.6), free-throw percentage (.702) and three-point percentage (.346). After setting a Big 12 freshman season record for scoring average and tying the Big 12 record for three-pointers, he was named the Big 12 Freshman of the Year by the Associated Press. Against Colorado, he had a career-high 34 points, while in a game versus Nebraska, he scored 30 points and had ten rebounds. After scoring 17 points with nine rebounds in the A&amp;M upset of Oklahoma State, King wa named the ESPN.com National Freshman of the Week.\nThe following year, King, who started 29 of 30 games, including all 16 in conference play, was named to the NABC Second-Team All-District. He averaged 18.0 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 4.8 assists per game, joining Duke's Jason Williams and Monmouth's Rahsaan Johnson as the only Division 1 players during the 2000–01 season to achieve at least 18 points and 4.6 assists per game.

        "text": "Brandon Miller (born May 4, 1979, in Orangeville, Ontario) is a former goaltender who most recently played for the Toronto Rock in the National Lacrosse League, and the Six Nations Chiefs and, formerly, the Brampton Excelsiors in the Ontario Lacrosse Association's Major Series. He has won four Mann Cups, two with each of the Chiefs and Excelsiors.\nNational Lacrosse League.\nAlbany Attack/San Jose Stealth.\nMiller started his career in 2001 with the Albany Attack (renamed the San Jose Stealth after the team relocated to California). He spent the early part of his career backing up Rob Blasdell and Anthony Cosmo, before joining the Chicago Shamrox and earning a spot as their starting goaltender.\nChicago Shamrox.\nChicago selected Miller first overall after San Jose left him unprotected in the 2006 expansion draft (when Chicago and the New York Titans joined the league).\nAt the 2007 All-Star Game in Portland, Miller was named to the All-Star team for the first time, as a reserve for the East squad. He split time with Matt Roik, allowing eight goals on 34 shots to earn the win. He also assisted on one of the East team's 20 goals.\nDespite Miller's stalwart play in net - 557 saves, facing an average of 45.19 shots per game - the Shamrox scored the third-fewest goals in the league in 2007, and missed the playoffs with a 6–10 record.\nPhiladelphia Wings.\nMidway through the 2008 season with the Shamrox struggling, Miller was dealt to the Philadelphia Wings for Roik and defenseman Brad Self.\nIn 2008, Philadelphia finished 10–6, and qualified as the fourth seed for the playoffs; the Shamrox finished 6–10, in last place in the East Division. The Wings took on the Buffalo Bandits in the first round of the playoffs, but were eliminated after a 14–12 loss. Miller replaced starting goaltender Rob Blasdell for the second half of the game, allowing five goals on 21 shots and picking up the loss.\nMiller split time with Blasdell again in 2009, his first full season with Philadelphia. Miller played about 60 per cent of the team's minutes, registering an 11.90 GAA and 76.94% save percentage. He also contributed offensively, registered six points - including a goal on March 28, 2009, against the Colorado Mammoth. The team, however, struggled, finishing the season 7-9 and missing the playoffs.\nPhiladelphia again missed the playoffs in 2010, finishing last in the East division with a 5–11 record. Miller earned the lion's share of the playing time (a career-high 885 minutes), and as a result, faced the most shots in the league (764) and made the second-most saves (581). Offensively, he contributed 9 assists, good for second in the league behind Cosmo's 13.\nMiller had, perhaps, his best statistical season in 2011. He posted career bests with an 11.25 goals against average and .774 save percentage. The team was plagued by a lack of goal scoring, though, finishing with a league-worst 143 goals for, finishing 5–11, tied for last in the league. Miller was selected for the All-Star game for the second time in his career.\nThe Wings made the playoffs in 2012 and again in 2013, but, unfortunately, were knocked out in the first round both years. In 2013, Miller finished second in Goaltender of the Year voting, behind Rochester's Matt Vinc. He finished fifth in saves for the season, and crossed the 4000-save mark for his career, becoming the 10th goaltender to achieve the mark. He was also named Defensive Player of the Week three times during the season, and was named to the Second All-Pro Team.\nToronto Rock.\nOn March 18, 2014, Miller was traded to the Toronto Rock for Kyle Belton, a conditional 2nd-round draft choice and a 4th-round draft choice in the 2014 NLL draft. The Rock finished the season 9-9 and qualified for the playoffs, but were eliminated in the first round.\nThe 2015 season saw Miller split time with Nick Rose; Rose and Miller finished 3rd and 4th, respectively, in the league in Goals Against Average. The Rock finished with a league-best 14–4 record, and allowed the 3rd-fewest goals in the league. Miller was a finalist for the Goaltender of the Year Award and made his first trip to the finals, where the Rock were beaten 2 games to 0 in the Best-of-3 series by the Edmonton Rush.\nIn 2016, Miller became just the seventh NLL goalie to register 5,000 career regular season saves.\nOn September 25, 2018, Miller announced his retirement as a player. He will be joining the Toronto Rock coaching staff as goaltending coach \nOntario Lacrosse Association.\nOrangeville Northmen.\nMiller and his brother Kyle Miller played Junior A lacrosse for the Orangeville Northmen.\nIn 2000, he shared the Dean McLeod Award - awarded to the MVP of the OLA Junior A playoffs - with Matt Vinc, as well as the Robert Melville Memorial Trophy - awarded to the Junior A league's outstanding goaltender - which he shared with teammate Kevin Samuel.\nBrampton Excelsiors.\nIn the NLL's off-season, Miller competes in the Ontario Lacrosse Association's Major Series. Miller competed for the Brampton Excelsiors until 2011. He joined the team in 2001, helping them to a Mann Cup appearance, where they were beaten in seven games by the Coquitlam Adanacs.\nIn 2002, he teamed again with Bob Watson in goal, and this time helped Brampton to a Mann Cup win over the Victoria Shamrocks, again in seven games, their second Mann Cup in five years. They lost just one game in the MSL playoffs on the way to the championship game, sweeping the St. Catharines Athletics and defeating the Brooklin Redmen four games to one.\nThe Excelsiors made a third consecutive Mann Cup appearance in 2003, again against the Shamrocks, but were unable to repeat as champions, losing in five games.\nFrom 2004 to 2007, Miller and the Excelsiors were defeated in the MSL finals by the Peterborough Lakers, twice in seven games and twice in six games.\nIn 2008, the Excelsiors were finally able to overcome Peterborough, winning a decisive seventh game 7–2 at home in Brampton. They were easily able to overcome the New Westminster Salmonbellies in four games, although Miller saw no action as he backed up eventual Mann Cup MVP Anthony Cosmo.\nWhile with the Excelsiors, he was a three-time recipient of the Harry Lumley Trophy - awarded to the goaltenders of the team that allowed the fewest goals in the regular season. In 2002, he shared the award with Bob Watson, and in 2007 and 2008, he and Cosmo received the award.\nSix Nations Chiefs.\nHe joined the Chiefs via trade from the Brampton Excelsiors; he and Rory Smith joined Six Nations in exchange for Matt Vinc, Mike Accursi, Tim O'Brien, and a 2013 first round selection. Backing up, primarily, Orangeville native Evan Kirk, Miller has compiled a 3–1 record with a 9.05 GAA in 12 games over two seasons.\nIn 2013, the Chiefs represented the OLA in the Mann Cup, against the Victoria Shamrocks. Miller did not appear in the first two games, but replaced Kirk in the third game, with the series tied. Miller suffered the loss, but Six Nations stormed back to take the series in six games, with Miller in goal for all but 20 minutes.\nThose 20 minutes occurred in Game 5 when Victoria asked officials to check Miller's equipment, which was deemed to be illegal, resulting in a minor penalty and a game misconduct. Kirk replaced him, but he, too, had his equipment deemed illegal, resulting in forward Colin Doyle settling into net for the final 11 minutes of the 11–7 win.\nMiller finished the series with a minuscule 4.45 GAA and .893 save percentage, ironically besting Shamrocks keeper Matt Vinc. The victory marked the first for the Chiefs since winning their third consecutive in 1996.\nFollowing the 2014 season, Miller won his fourth Harry Lumley Trophy, sharing the award with Kirk. The Chiefs repeated as Mann Cup Champions, and Miller was awarded the Mike Kelley Memorial Trophy as the series MVP.\nStatistics.\nNLL.\nReference:\nMann Cup.\n\"* - Won Mann Cup\""

        "text": "The 2008 Daytona 500, the 50th annual running of the event, was held on February 17, 2008 at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. The race was the 50th to be run since the first in 1959, won by Lee Petty. To commemorate the event, the Harley J. Earl Trophy, which goes to the winner of the race, was plated in gold instead of silver. In addition, the winning car was placed on display for one year at the Daytona 500 Experience attraction just outside Turn Four. Ryan Newman won the race, his only win in the 2008 season and his final win for team owner Roger Penske.\nA number of firsts.\nThe race was the first Daytona 500 win for Penske Racing and the first run using NASCAR's Car of Tomorrow, which was introduced in 2007 and became standard in 2008. Additionally, this was the first official race under the new Sprint Cup banner as the telecommunications giant replaces Nextel as the series sponsor after their 2005 merger. Ryan Newman's victory with the number 12 car in the Daytona 500 was the first time since Bobby Allison's #12 won the race in 1988, 20 years prior.\nTelevision and radio coverage.\nThe race was televised on FOX in the USA, with the telecast scheduled beginning at 2 p.m. EST. 1960 Daytona 500 winner Junior Johnson drove the pace car and the green flag was waved the honorary starter, seven-time race winner Richard Petty around 3:30 p.m. Radio coverage was handled by MRN Radio and started at about 2:30 EST. Trisha Yearwood performed the national anthem, followed by a flyover from the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds precision flying team. As many as 31 past champions of this race served as Grand Marshals for this historic event to deliver the command to start the engines.\nCelebrity tickets for charity.\nTo commemorate the golden running of \"The Great American Race\", Daytona International Speedway held a “Celebrity Tickets for Charity” competition. Those designs were whittled on daytona500.com by internet users down to the top ten choices. Celebrities including Daytona 500 winners Kevin Harvick, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Michael Waltrip, Jimmie Johnson and Mario Andretti, sitcom stars Jason Lee and Leah Remini, TV hosts Kelly Ripa \"(Live with Regis and Kelly)\", Jeff Foxworthy \"(Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?)\" and Carson Daly \"(Last Call with Carson Daly)\", NASCAR announcers Mike Joy from FOX and Dr. Jerry Punch from ESPN, wrestler Goldberg and skateboarding legend Tony Hawk submitted ticket designs. A blue-ribbon panel made up of NASCAR's family selected the winner and announced it prior to the running of the Pepsi 400, with the ten finalists among Harvick (defending 2007 champion), Earnhardt Jr. (2004 winner), Andretti (1967 winner) and Marvin Panch (1961 winner), Hawk, Joy, Katie Cole (the second of two designs), Foxworthy, and two children – 17-year-old Patrick McRae (for Jimmie Johnson, the 2006 winner) and seven-year-old Derek Wynne (for owner Rick Hendrick). Foxworthy was later declared the winner of the contest and his winning ticket artwork along with the others of all the celebrities were auctioned off to benefit the Jeff Gordon Foundation.\nPurse.\nAs befitting the official start of the NASCAR season, the posted awards (announced on January 28, 2008) was a record $18,689,238 (US), with the winning team and their driver taking home a minimum of $1,445,250.\nQualifying.\nPole.\nAs is the unique approach that is The Great American Race, qualifying, which was held on February 10, only the top two drivers (which will be the front row) were locked in, with Jimmie Johnson taking position one and Michael Waltrip sitting next to him. Also qualifying via the fastest speeds among the \"Go or Go Home\" entries were Joe Nemechek and David Reutimann.\nGatorade Duels.\nThe remaining spots were determined by the top finishers excluding the front row drivers in two races called the Gatorade Duels, which were raced February 14, which filled the next 36 positions. The remaining spots were determined by exemptions and the fastest speeds and a champions provisional.\nResults of the Duels.\nDrivers in boldface qualified to the Daytona 500.\nRace 1 Results.\nAlso advancing to Daytona 500: 83-Brian Vickers\nRace 2 Results.\n\"NOTE: Race #2 was extended four laps due to green-white-checker finish rule.\nFailed to qualify:\nRace.\nIn the beginning of the race, Jimmie Johnson and Michael Waltrip started on the front row. For the first 151 laps, there were only two caution flags, both thrown for debris. Jeff Gordon went to the garage after leading a few laps due to a broken suspension. On lap 161, David Ragan tried to block Matt Kenseth but brought out the 3rd caution when Ragan squeezed Kenseth into the wall. The next caution flew on lap 176, when Johnson spun out on the backstretch, and Martin Truex Jr. spun because of the shuffle in the field. Clint Bowyer led the next two laps, but was shuffled through the field and was eventually spun by Juan Pablo Montoya, bringing out the 5th caution. However, he did not have any damage from the crash. The biggest crash occurred on lap 189 when Kevin Harvick knocked Dave Blaney into the wall, collecting Mark Martin, Michael Waltrip, Casey Mears, Denny Hamlin, Travis Kvapil, and Carl Edwards. Mears did not pit and wound up 4th in the field despite minor damage. On lap 195, Jeff Burton worked his way up to first. Mears tried to block Tony Stewart, who went with Burton, but turned himself into the wall, bringing out another caution. Burton had a fuel problem on the restart, resulting in Stewart passing him on the outside, bringing Ryan Newman, Kurt and Kyle Busch and Reed Sorenson. Stewart led the next two laps. On the last lap, Ky. Busch jumped to the inside, bringing Stewart with him. Newman was on the outside now. It was a shootout going into the final turn between Newman, Stewart, and the Busch Brothers. Ky. Busch jumped to the inside of Stewart, but Ku. Busch pushed Newman, allowing him to win the 50th running of the Daytona 500.\nResults.\n(W) – Denotes former race winner.\n(R) – Denotes rookie.\n• – Led most laps\nAverage Speed: \nMargin of Victory: .092 seconds\nTime of Race: Three hours, 16 minutes and 30 seconds\nLead Changes: 42 among 17 drivers\nCautions: Seven for 23 laps"

        "title": "Tom Keating (American football)",
        "text": "Thomas Arthur Keating (September 2, 1942 – August 31, 2012) was an American professional football defensive tackle. He played college football for the Michigan Wolverines from 1961 to 1963 and played 12 seasons in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL) from 1964 to 1975. He was an AFL All-Star in 1966 and 1967, a key to the 1967 Oakland Raiders' defensive line that led the team to a 13–1 record and the 1967 AFL Championship, and was considered \"the premier tackle in the old American Football League\". He was known for his use of a distinctive four-point stance in which he lined up with both hands on the ground.\nEarly years.\nKeating was born in Chicago in 1942. He attended St. Mel High School in Chicago.\nUniversity of Michigan.\nKeating enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1960 and played college football at the tackle position on head coach Bump Elliott's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1961 to 1963. As a junior, he started eight of nine games at left tackle for the 1962 Michigan Wolverines football team that compiled a 2–7 record and finished in last place in the Big Ten Conference. As a senior, he started all nine games at left tackle and was selected as the Most Valuable Player on the 1963 Michigan Wolverines football team that compiled a 3-4-2 record and finished in fifth place in the Big Ten Conference.\nProfessional football.\nBuffalo Bills.\nKeating was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the fifth round (34th overall pick) of the 1964 American Football League Draft. The Buffalo Bills immediately traded for him because Bills' management and ownership firmly believed that they could sign Tom and not lose him to the NFL. The strategy paid off in May of 1964 when Tom signed with the Bills. He spent the 1964 and 1965 AFL seasons as a backup player for the Bills, appearing in three games in 1964 and six games in 1965.\nOakland Raiders.\nKeating joined the Oakland Raiders for the 1966 AFL season. He earned AFL All-Star honors with the Raider in 1966 and 1967. He was the starting right tackle for the Raiders' 1967 AFL Championship victory over the Houston Oilers as well as their Super Bowl II loss to the Green Bay Packers. Keating anchored a defensive line for the 1967 Raiders team that finished with the fewest yards rushing and the fewest rushing yards per attempt in the AFL, as well as third in fewest passing yards and second fewest points allowed. The front four of Keating, Dan Birdwell, Ike Lassiter, and Ben Davidson contributed to the team's total of 67 sacks and 666 yards lost against the opposing offense. He played for the Raiders through 1972. He was considered \"the premier tackle in the old American Football League\" until he was slowed by a series of leg injuries.\nPittsburgh Steelers.\nIn July 1973, the Raiders traded Keating to the Pittsburgh Steelers for an undisclosed 1974 draft pick. Keating appeared in 12 games, four as a starter, for the Steelers during the 1973 NFL season.\nKansas City Chiefs.\nIn September 1974, Keating signed with the Kansas City Chiefs. He became a starter for the Chiefs during the 1974 NFL season, appearing in 14 games, including 12 as the team's starting left tackle, replacing Curley Culp, who was traded to the Houston Oilers. He concluded his football career with the Chiefs in 1975, appearing in nine games, four as a starter.\nLater years and family.\nHe was one of the fifteen plaintiffs in \"Mackey v. National Football League\" in which Judge Earl R. Larson declared that the Rozelle rule was a violation of antitrust laws on December 30, 1975.\nAfter retiring from football, Keating worked as a private investigator for a law firm and later opened his own agency in Walnut Creek, California. He maintained his primary residence in the Bay Area, but began spending several months a year in Limoux in the south of France.\nKeating had three sons, James Alexander Keating, Patrick Gould and Ryan Gould. Keating's younger brother, Bill Keating, also played football for the University of Michigan and in the American Football League.\nKeating died from prostate cancer in 2012 at a hospice in Denver, Colorado. Postmortem, Keating was diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy. He was one of at least 345 NFL players to be diagnosed after death with this disease, which is caused by repeated hits to the head."

        "text": "The Villanova Wildcats men's basketball program represent Villanova University in men's college basketball and competes in the Big East Conference of NCAA Division I. Their first season was the 1920–21 season. Named the Wildcats, Villanova is a member of the Philadelphia Big Five, five Philadelphia college basketball teams who share a passionate rivalry.\nThe Wildcats have won the national championship three times: 1985, 2016, and 2018. Their 1985 NCAA championship victory as an 8 seed still stands as the lowest seed ever to win the title. The championship game of that year is referred to as \"The Perfect Game\" as they shot a championship game record 78.6% as a team for the game (22 for 28, including 9 for 10 in the second half). Their 2016 NCAA Championship is referred to as \"The Perfect Ending\" and became the second of only two NCAA Men's Championship games to be won on a buzzer beater when Kris Jenkins drained a shot as time expired. Their most recent national championship victory in 2018 was the culmination of a season many believe to be one of, if not, the greatest college basketball season for a team of all time. They made the Final Four in 1939, 1971, 1985, 2009, 2016, 2018, and 2022; their six Final Four appearances are 13th most all-time. As of 2019, they have an NCAA Tournament record of 65–37 (). \nVillanova has defeated six No. 1 seeds in the NCAA tournament (Michigan and Georgetown in 1985, Pittsburgh in 2009, Kansas and North Carolina in 2016, and Kansas in 2018), which is sixth most all-time. The Villanova Wildcats have appeared in the NCAA tournament 39 times, the eighth highest total in NCAA history. They have won the Big East regular season championship eight times, most recently winning four straight from 2014 to 2017. They won the Big East tournament in 1995, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2022. Through 2021, Villanova has 1,817 wins, which is 19th among Division I men's basketball teams and is tied for 9th in all time winning percentage at (.657). Villanova has won the Philadelphia Big Five 27 times, and is tied with Temple University for the most of any team, including five straight from 2014 to 2018. The Wildcats have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament 18 times, winning in 1994.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1920–1936).\nVillanova began its varsity basketball program in 1920. Michael Saxe coached for six seasons, from 1920 to 1926, compiling a 64–30 record (.681). John Cashman coached three seasons, from 1926 to 1929, compiling a 21–26 record (.447). George \"Doc\" Jacobs coached seven seasons, from 1929 to 1936, and had a 62–56 record (.525).\nThe team played its first game in 1920 in Alumni Hall on Villanova's campus, beating Catholic University 43–40. In the early years, Villanova's home courts were Alumni Hall and West Catholic High School. In 1932, The Wildcats moved into the Villanova Field House—now known as the Jake Nevin Field House, which was named after Villanova's long-time trainer. Villanova also played many home games at the Palestra on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania beginning in 1929. The Wildcats played home games in both the Villanova Field House and the Palestra until 1986.\nAl Severance era (1936–1961).\nAl Severance coached Villanova for 25 seasons, from 1936 to 1961. It was under Severance's leadership that Villanova's basketball program rose to prominence. Severance compiled a 413–201 record (.673).\nThe 1938–39 team won the first-ever NCAA Tournament game, which put them in the inaugural Final Four. Severance led the Wildcats to the NCAA tournament again in 1949, 1951, and 1955. Villanova earned NIT bids in 1959 and 1960.\nThe most storied player in Villanova history, Paul Arizin, played during this era. Severance discovered Arizin, already a Villanova student, playing basketball in the Villanova Fieldhouse. Arizin holds the Villanova record for most points in a game (85), and is credited with inventing the jump shot and was the 1949 College Player of the Year.\nOther notable players from the Severance era include Joe Lord, Larry Hennessy, Bob Schafer and George Raveling.\nCoincidentally, Severance died on April 1, 1985, which was the same day that Villanova upset Georgetown University and Patrick Ewing to take the NCAA basketball championship.\n1939 Final Four.\nThe inaugural NCAA tournament featured eight teams from throughout the country. Villanova, representing the Mid-Atlantic states, beat Brown, representative of the New England States, 43–40 before a crowd of 3,500 at the Palestra. The following night, the Wildcats lost to Ohio State 53–36 in the Eastern Division championship.\nJack Kraft era (1961–1973).\nJack Kraft coached Villanova for 12 years, from 1961 through 1973. He compiled a 238–95 record (.715). Kraft led Villanova to the NCAA tournament six times, and five times to the NIT. Only once did Kraft's teams fail to earn a post-season bid, in his final season.\nNotable players during the Jack Kraft era include: Chris Ford, Tom Ingelsby, Wali Jones, Bill Melchionni, Howard Porter, Jim Washington, and Hubie White.\n1971 NCAA Finalist.\nOn March 27, 1971, Villanova made its first appearance in an NCAA basketball tournament championship game. The unheralded Wildcats took on the legendary John Wooden and his mighty UCLA Bruins. The 28–1 UCLA squad featured Sidney Wicks, Curtis Rowe, Henry Bibby, and Steve Patterson. Going into the title game, the Bruins had won six of the previous seven NCAA championships, including the previous four.\nJack Kraft's Villanova squad, nicknamed the \"Iron Men\", was made up of just nine players. Led by Howard Porter, Clarence Smith, Hank Siemiontkowski, Chris Ford, Tom Ingelsby, Bob Gohl, Mike Daley, John Fox and Joe McDowell. Villanova amassed a 27–6 record, including a shocking 90–47 victory over a previously undefeated powerhouse Penn squad.\nVillanova fought from behind for most of the game, twice cutting the lead to three in the final minutes. Villanova lost by six, 68–62. Up to that time, the six-point loss was the narrowest spread of UCLA's six NCAA title game victories.\nDespite the loss, Villanova's Howard Porter was named the Tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Porter was later stripped of the award and the team's NCAA victories were vacated after it was discovered that Porter had violated NCAA rules because he had signed a professional contract with the Pittsburgh Condors of the American Basketball Association during the middle of his senior year.\nRollie Massimino era (1973–1992).\nDuring Rollie Massimino's tenure, the Villanova Wildcats abandoned their traditional independent status by joining the newly formed Eastern Eight Conference in 1975. In 1980, the Wildcats moved into the new Big East Conference, along with Georgetown, St. John's, and Syracuse. The 1980s were the golden age of the Big East, highlighted by the 1985 NCAA tournament, when Villanova, Georgetown, and St. John's all reached the Final Four.\nMassimino's teams had tremendous success in the NCAA tournament, usually in an underdog role. He led the Wildcats to the NCAA tournament 11 times, winning in 1985, and his teams reached the Elite Eight five times in an 11-year span: 1978, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1988. Massimino's teams were well-prepared for the tournament, always playing a difficult schedule and emphasizing tenacious defense. Massimino lost the opening game in the NCAA tournament only once, to Shaquille O'Neal and Chris Jackson-led LSU in 1990, and he remarkably never lost to a lower-seeded team.\nMassimino coached for 19 seasons at Villanova, compiling a record of 357–241 (.596). In the NCAA tournament, Massimino had a 20–10 record (.667).\nNotable players from the Massimino era include Alex Bradley, Stewart Granger, Keith Herron, Dwayne McClain, Harold Jensen, Ed Pinckney, John Pinone, Harold Pressley, Rory Sparrow, and Doug West.\nIn 1976, the Wildcats played their first game in the Spectrum in Philadelphia. Because of the greater seating capacity, Villanova generally played a few home games each year at the Spectrum until the opening of what is now known as the Wells Fargo Center. Villanova christened its current home court as John Eleuthère du Pont Pavilion, now the Pavilion, with a 64–62 victory over Maryland on February 1, 1986.\n1985 National Champions.\nIn 1985, under the direction of Massimino, the men's basketball team completed one of the most surprising runs in NCAA tournament history by winning the national championship in the first year of the 64-team field. The eighth-seeded Wildcats (unranked in the final AP poll) beat Dayton (at Dayton), top-seeded Michigan, Maryland and second-seeded North Carolina to win the Southeast Regional en route to the Final Four in Lexington, Kentucky. After defeating 2-seed Memphis State in the national semifinals, Villanova met defending champion Georgetown, a 10-favorite led by Patrick Ewing, in the title game on April 1, 1985. \nTop-seeded Georgetown had beaten conference rival Villanova twice during the regular season, and had reached the title game with tenacious defense, which gave up less than 40% of their opponents' shots from the field in both the regular season and the postseason. Before the championship game, Massimino told his team they had to play a perfect game in order to beat Georgetown. In perhaps the greatest shooting performance in NCAA history, the Wildcats went 22-of-28 from the field to convert a blistering 78.6% of their shots, including a second half where they missed only one basket. The Hoyas hung tough, converting 55% of their 53 attempts, but were unable to overcome the astounding shooting performance as Villanova won 66–64 to claim the NCAA championship. The Wildcat squad remains the only eight-seed and the lowest overall seed in tournament history to win the championship, and their overall team shooting percentage remains an NCAA tournament record for a single game. The game is often cited among the greatest upsets in college basketball history. Ed Pinckney, who shot 5-of-7 and had 16 points in the game, was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. This game is featured in the book \"The Perfect Game\" by Frank Fitzpatrick.\nSteve Lappas era (1992–2001).\nLappas compiled a very respectable record of 174–110 (.613) during his years at Villanova. The 1994 and 1995 teams, led by Kerry Kittles, Jason Lawson, Eric Eberz, and Alvin Williams, won the NIT and Big East tournaments, respectively. The 1995 Big East tournament title was capped by a decisive victory over a Connecticut team that had been ranked Number 1 during the regular season before being defeated on the Huskies home court by Villanova. This represents the one and only time Villanova won the original Big East tournament before the Conference was reconfigured in 2013.\nUnder Coach Lappas, Villanova reached the NCAA tournament in 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1999, compiling a disappointing 2–4 record and never advancing beyond the second round. After a 2001 First round NIT loss at Minnesota, junior center Michael Bradley announced he was forgoing his final year of eligibility to enter the NBA draft, essentially leaving Villanova without a returning star player. Shortly thereafter, Hofstra coach and former Massimino assistant Jay Wright became available, and the Administration decided a coaching change would benefit all parties. Lappas left Villanova to pursue other opportunities, ultimately becoming a respected television analyst for CBS coverage of NCAA basketball, and has been welcomed back with open arms to the Villanova basketball family.\nNotable players in the Lappas era include Michael Bradley, Kerry Kittles, Jason Lawson, Tim Thomas, John Celestand and Alvin Williams and Eric Eberz.\nDuring the Lappas-era, Villanova began playing a few major home games at the Wells Fargo Center beginning in 1996. Villanova's first game in the new arena was a December 1996 loss to the Duke Blue Devils. Wells Fargo Center was known as the CoreStates Center, the First Union Center, and the Wachovia Center before it adopted the Wells Fargo Center name.\nJay Wright era (2001–2022).\nJay Wright was named Villanova's head coach in 2001. As Rollie Massimino's assistant from 1987 through 1992, he was well-acquainted with Villanova. Prior to his hiring by Villanova, Wright was head coach at Hofstra. \nVillanova earned a post-season tournament berth in each of Wright's initial ten seasons as Villanova head coach before missing in 2011–12. The Wildcats played in the NIT in 2002, 2003, and 2004, and in 14 of 15 NCAA Tournaments since 2005. Wright's Villanova teams have reached 6 Regionals, 4 Final Fours and have won 2 National Championships. During Wright's tenure, Villanova has compiled a 34–13 record in the NCAA tournament, crowned with the 2016 and 2018 National Championships. Six of Wright's NCAA Tournament losses at Villanova have been to the eventual National Champion.\nOne of the highlights of his tenure was an amazing run to the 2009 Final Four when Villanova beat #1 seeded Pittsburgh to win the Elite 8 on a coast-to-coast buzzer beating layup by team captain Scottie Reynolds. Villanova subsequently lost the national semifinals to eventual NCAA Champion North Carolina.\nStrong starts to the 2009–10 and 2010–11 seasons were followed by struggling finishes. Villanova barely beat Robert Morris in overtime before taking losses at the hands of St Mary's (2010) and George Mason (2011) in NCAA Tournament play. Villanova had a rebuilding 2011–12 season, compiling a 13–19 record and missing a post-season bid for the only time in Wright's tenure.\nA young nucleus in 2012–13 was a portent of future glory and saw the Wildcats make a return trip to the 2013 NCAA tournament where they fell to once-and-future foe North Carolina. Still, a #2 seed in 2013–14 and a #1 seed in 2014–15 preceded second round NCAA exits at the hands of Connecticut (2014) and N.C. State (2015) causing Nova Nation some well-publicized consternation. The 2016 and 2018 Championship runs put the \"underachiever\" tag to the sword, cementing Wright's Villanova legacy as the program's greatest mentor. The 2016 National Championship victory was accomplished on the strength of Kris Jenkin's NBA-range 3 point buzzer bomb, thwarting North Carolina. The 2018 Championship win over Michigan culminated a six-game NCAA tournament run in which no opponent finished within a dozen points of the Wildcats.\nNotable players during the Jay Wright era include Randy Foye, Kyle Lowry, Dante Cunningham, Allan Ray, Mike Nardi, Will Sheridan, Curtis Sumpter, Scottie Reynolds, Corey Fisher, JayVaughn Pinkston, Darrun Hilliard, 2016 champions including Final Four most outstanding player Ryan Arcidiacono, Daniel Ochefu, Kris Jenkins and Josh Hart. Four Villanova players from the 2018 championship team were drafted by the NBA—national player of the year and Final Four most outstanding player Jalen Brunson, Mikal Bridges, Donte Divincenzo and Omari Spellman. National title holdovers Phil Booth and Eric Paschall keyed Villanova' surprising run to the 2019 Big East Regular Season and tournament championships. In the 2019 NCAA Tournament, six seed Villanova gained a measure of revenge against St. Mary's with a first-round victory followed by a loss to Purdue, a strong 3 seed, in the second round. Booth ended his Villanova career as the all-time winningest player in program history with 2 national titles and 4 Big East tournament championships (2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019).\n2004–05 season.\nUnder coach Jay Wright, Villanova's men's basketball team reached the 2005 NCAA Tournament Sweet 16, defeating New Mexico and Florida before losing to #1 seed and eventual champion North Carolina by one point. Junior Forward Curtis Sumpter was injured in the Florida game and did not return to the court until the 2006–07 season. There is controversy surrounding a disputed traveling call against Allan Ray made in the closing seconds of the UNC game. With under a minute left and Villanova down by three, Ray drove and made a shot. There was contact with a UNC defender and a whistle. Most assumed the whistle signified a foul on Carolina, giving Ray a chance to tie the game with the resultant free-throw. Incredibly, the officials ruled that Ray committed a traveling violation prior to taking the shot, negating the basket, and rendering Kyle Lowry's buzzer beating 3 pointer a mere footnote to a painful loss. In an ironic twist of fate, Booth, late in the 2016 National Championship game (also against North Carolina), made a crucial \"and one\" three point opportunity denied Allan Ray 12 years earlier.\n2005–06 season.\nLed by senior guards Randy Foye and Allan Ray as well as sophomore guard Kyle Lowry, the Villanova men's basketball team began the 2005–2006 year ranked #4 in the major polls from USA Today and the Associated Press. Having lost only three regular season games, the Wildcats enjoyed a #1 seed in the 2006 tournament—their first.\nThe Wildcats' wins over Monmouth, Arizona, and Boston College brought them back to the Elite Eight for the first time since 1988. Villanova's 75–62 upset loss in Minneapolis to eventual champion Florida ended the team's run toward a Regional Final. The loss to Florida was the second consecutive year that Villanova was eliminated in the NCAA tournament by the eventual national champion. The Wildcats' 28 wins during the 2006 campaign was the second most victories for any Villanova Men's Basketball team at that time. Foye, Ray and Lowry all entered the NBA following the season.\n2006–07 season.\nWright's 2006–2007 team was composed mainly of freshmen and sophomores who, at times, struggled to mesh. The Wildcats improved throughout the season, due in large part to the emergence of freshman Scottie Reynolds. Villanova finished the 2006–07 season with a record of 22–11. The Wildcats earned an at-large bid to the 2007 NCAA Tournament, where they lost in the second round to the Kentucky Wildcats. Villanova's 2006–07 free throw percentage of .781 led the NCAA, and set a Villanova season record.\n2007–08 season.\nThe 2007–08 campaign was an erratic one for the young Wildcats, a team with no seniors. After a promising 9–1 start, Villanova had a rough start to its Big East season. In mid-season, the Wildcats lost five consecutive games by double digits and lost 6 of 7 games during a 3-week span in the middle of the season, as the freshmen struggled to adjust to the college game, and the experienced players encountered difficulties in adjusting to leadership positions. In February and March, as the players became more comfortable within Coach Wright's system, and with improved defense, the team began to win.\nA win against Syracuse in the Big East tournament was good enough for the Wildcats to secure one of the final at-large bids to the NCAA tournament. Villanova proved it was worthy of the bid when an upset over Clemson and a victory over Siena put them in the final 16 teams in the tournament, where they lost to eventual National Champion Kansas.\n2008–09 season.\nMost notable in the 2008–09 season was the rise to prominence of senior forward Dante Cunningham. Cunningham averaged 16.1 points per game, an increase of nearly 6 points over the previous season. He also managed to average 7.5 rebounds, 1.2 blocks, and 1.2 steals per game. Cunningham was honored as the Big East Most Improved Player. His teammate, tenacious sophomore guard Corey Fisher, was also honored as the Big East Sixth Man of the Year for his contributions off the bench.\nThe Wildcats finished the regular season with a mark of 26–7, earning a school record for most regular season victories. They lost their final regular season game to the Louisville Cardinals, 69–55, in the fourth round, or semi-finals of the Big East tournament. The Wildcats began the NCAA tournament at the Wachovia Center, a secondary venue for home games. They survived an early scare by American to handily beat two of college basketball's most prestigious programs, UCLA and Duke, in the rounds of 32 and 16 by a combined margin of 43 points.\nVillanova won a very close match up against number 1 seed Pittsburgh in the Elite 8 round of the tournament, with guard Scottie Reynolds racing down the court to make a layup with only 0.5 seconds left. Pitt took the final shot, which bounced off the backboard to end the game. The last-second basket by Reynolds was widely hailed as one of the most exciting plays of that year's tournament, with Sports Illustrated's Seth Davis calling the victory \"one of the great games in NCAA tournament history\". Villanova advanced to the Final Four where they faced the North Carolina Tar Heels. Villanova fell to the Tar Heels in the national semifinals at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan, by a final score of 83–69. This was the fourth time in five years that Villanova's tournament ouster was by the eventual national champion.\nThe Wildcats' record of 30–8 broke a previous high for most victories in a season, a distinction previously held by the 2005–06 Wildcats squad. The senior class of 2009, composed of forwards Dante Cunningham, Shane Clark, Dwayne Anderson and Frank Tchuisi, earned the distinction of being the winningest senior class in school history.\n2009–10 season.\nThe Wildcats enjoyed another highly successful regular season, finishing with a record of 24–7 and earning a #2 Seed in the NCAA tournament. They lost in the first round of the Big East tournament to Marquette and required overtime to defeat 15th seeded Robert Morris University in the opening round of the NCAA tournament. The Wildcats were defeated in the 2nd round by the 10th seeded St. Mary's Gaels.\nScottie Reynolds ended his career as the second-leading scorer in Villanova history with 2,222 points, 21 points short of breaking Kerry Kittles's all-time record. He finished his college career with 472 assists and 203 steals. Reynolds was named to the 2010 AP All-American 1st team, but was not selected in the NBA draft.\n2016 National Champions.\nThe Wildcats enjoyed another highly successful regular season and held the AP #1 ranking in the nation for the first time in school history over a 3-week period. They finished the regular season with a 27–4 record losing only to teams (Oklahoma, Virginia, Providence, Xavier) that were ranked at the time of the match-up. Villanova finished Big East Conference play 16–2 for the third year in a row also garnering their 3rd straight outright Regular Season Conference Title.\nAfter losing in the Big East tournament championship Game to Seton Hall, 69–67, the Wildcats earned a 2 seed in the NCAA tournament South Region where they dispatched the #15 seeded UNC Asheville by 30 points, followed by a 19-point win over #7 seed Iowa. After defeating #3 seed Miami by 23, they moved on to the Elite Eight to face the overall #1 seed Kansas Jayhawks. The Wildcats defense shined as they won by 5 points to advance to their 5th Final Four and the first since 2009. They faced #2 seed Oklahoma Sooners, who had beaten Villanova by 23 on December 7, 2015, at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii early in the season. In the national semi-Finals, Villanova beat the Sooners by 44 points (an NCAA Final Four record) to advance to the NCAA Championship for the first time in 31 years. They faced the second-overall #1 seed North Carolina Tar Heels for the championship.\nOn April 4, Villanova defeated UNC on a game-winning three-point shot at the buzzer by Kris Jenkins to win the NCAA Championship by a final score of 77–74, winning their second NCAA championship. UNC had recovered from a 10-point deficit in the final five minutes to tie the game on an off-balance, double-clutch three-point shot that passed through the net with 4.7 seconds left, leaving the Wildcats one last chance to clinch a victory before overtime. Kris Jenkins inbounded the ball to four-year team captain Ryan Arcidiacono, who dribbled down court, passed the ball and set a bubble screen to assist Jenkins' game-winning shot. Coach Jay Wright credits the play to the \"Wildcat minute\", where the team practices late-game scenarios at every practice. The game has been called one of the greatest in the history of NCAA tournament championships.\nVillanova ended the 2016 season at 35–5 including the unanimous #1 ranking in the final Coaches' Poll (USA Today) while capturing their 2nd NCAA basketball championship trophy in the history of the program. In beating #3 seed Miami (AP #10), #1 seed Kansas (AP #1), #2 seed Oklahoma (AP #7) and #1 seed UNC (AP #3), Villanova became the first school in 31 years — since the 1985 Villanova Wildcats — to not only beat four top-three seeds on the way to a national title but to also beat four straight opponents ranked in the AP top 10, in addition to beating AP-ranked Iowa in the Round of 32. Villanova's run included two of the ten most offensively efficient games in the analytics era (2002–present), beating Miami and Oklahoma by scoring 1.56 and 1.51 points per possession in the Sweet Sixteen and Final Four, respectively. It has been called perhaps the most dominant tournament championship run of all time, and the most dominant of the analytics era by a wide margin, with Villanova posting an average margin of victory equal to 20.7 points per game (+124 total point margin).\n2018 National Champions.\nThe Wildcats finished second in regular season Big East play, won the Big East tournament, and were undefeated in non-conference play. They were awarded the top seed in the East Regional for the NCAA tournament. They reached the Final Four with wins over 16 seed Radford, 9 seed Alabama, 5 seed West Virginia and 3 seed Texas Tech with each victory coming by double-digit margins. In the national semifinals they faced the Kansas Jayhawks, the one seed from the Midwest Region, and defeated them 95–79. In this game Villanova set the new record for successful 3-point attempts in a Final Four game (breaking the previous full-game record before reaching halftime, finishing with 18 total made attempts). In the NCAA tournament championship Game they played the Michigan Wolverines, the 3 seed from the West Region. The Wildcats earned their third national championship in school history by beating the Wolverines 79–62. The game saw a historic performance by Big East Sixth Man of the Year Donte DiVincenzo (31 points, 5 rebounds, 3 assists, 2 steals and 2 blocks), named the 2018 Final Four's Most Outstanding Player. Coach Wright led the team to a 36–4 record for the 2017–18 season (14–4 Big East). The 36–4 mark sets the record for most wins in any Villanova season. Jalen Brunson received the Wooden Award as well as Associated Press and Naismith National Player of the Year Awards for his season leading the Wildcats. Mikal Bridges was presented the Julius Erving Award as the nation's best small forward—the second straight year a Villanova player achieved that honor after Josh Hart won it in 2017. Jay Wright was named winner of the John R. Wooden Legends of Coaching Award.\nAwards and honors.\nBig East Most Improved Player of the Year\nPostseason.\nNCAA Tournament history.\nVillanova has appeared in 40 NCAA Tournaments, beginning with the first in 1939. The Wildcats have amassed a tournament record of 67–38 (), and were the national champions in 1985, 2016, and 2018. Their three titles are the 8th most of any program. They have reached the Final Four five times, tied for fifteenth most. Villanova has won as the underdog (based on Tournament seeding) 16 times, more than any other program, and they are the highest seed (8) to ever win the NCAA tournament (1985). Villanova is one of only two programs (the other being Ohio State) that has played in the NCAA tournament in every decade since the 1930s.\nNCAA Tournament Seeding History.\n\"The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\"\nNIT history.\nThe Wildcats have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 18 times. Their combined record is 24–18. They were NIT Champions in 1994.\nNational Campus Basketball Tournament results.\nThe Wildcats appeared in the only National Campus Basketball Tournament. Their record is 0–1.\nIndividual honors.\nVillanova honors outstanding former players, coaches, and others by retiring their numbers or jerseys. For those honored, a replica jersey is hung in the rafters of the Pavilion. Uniform numbers of retired jerseys remain in circulation, while retired numbers are no longer used. Paul Arizin's #11 is the only retired number. , 21 have been honored with a retired number or jersey, including 16 players, four coaches, and longtime trainer Jake Nevin.\nRetired/honored jerseys.\nThe honorees include:\nRivals.\nBig East.\nSome Villanovans count Georgetown as their most intense rivalry, having played a historic NCAA Championship game and many competitive Big East tournament and regular season games against the Hoyas. Other rivals from the Big East Conference include founding members of the original Big East—Providence (an eastern rivalry which predates the original Big East) and St. John's, plus Syracuse who left the Big East as part of its 2013 split for the ACC.\nSeton Hall has played Villanova more than any other school; due to the proximity of the schools and a series of memorable games since the formation of the new Big East, this has become one of Villanova's top rivalries each season. Games have included critical Seton Hall upsets in 2013, the 2014 Big East tournament, Villanova's first loss of 2015, and the 2016 Big East tournament championship as well as a Villanova blowout in a game that resulted in Seton Hall guard Sterling Gibbs punching Villanova guard Ryan Arcidiacono in 2015 and a narrow victory in the closing seconds of the 2017 Big East tournament semifinals.\nBig Five.\nVillanova along with Saint Joseph's University, La Salle University, Temple University, and University of Pennsylvania banded together to create the Philadelphia Big 5 in 1954–55. From that date until the mid-1970s all Big 5 games were contested at the Palestra (cap. 9,208) on Penn's campus. The Five competed in a round-robin City Series. Additionally, all participated in numerous doubleheaders against non-Big 5 opponents. Most games were televised locally on WPHL-TV, broadcast by Harry Kalas.\nSince the beginning of the 1996–1997 season, Villanova has won 15 out of 21 Big 5 titles. They currently have 25 total Big 5 titles which is second most among the participating schools.\nVillanova's most bitter Big 5 rival is Saint Joseph's University, in what has become known as the Holy War.\nTraditions.\nVillanova basketball athletes traditionally remain enrolled four years, graduate, and go on to enjoy post-college success. Villanova has never fired a head basketball coach (men's or women's). Villanova has won more NCAA tournament games as a lower seed than any school. Villanova won what has been called the greatest college basketball game ever played, defeating Georgetown 66–64 on April 1, 1985, to win the NCAA national championship.\nSongs.\n\"V for Villanova\" is the Wildcats' fight song. Other Villanova songs include \"March of the Wildcats\".\nStreamers.\nVillanova had a tradition of throwing paper streamers in the school colors of blue and white onto the basketball court at home games, particularly Big Five games, after the first Wildcat basket. This tradition was shared by other Big Five basketball teams, and at Big Five games, streamers were thrown by both teams following their team's first field goal. The tradition was stopped in the late 1980s after the NCAA declared that throwing streamers would result in a technical foul. Since then Villanova has restarted the tradition, throwing the streamers on the first basket of the new season during the blue and white scrimmage game during Hoops Mania.\nHoops Mania.\nHoops Mania has been an annual tradition to celebrate the start of basketball season. It was originally held in the Jake Nevin Fieldhouse for students and has since grown larger after the success of the 2005–06 season. It is now held in the Pavilion and is open to the public and students. Following an inter-team scrimmage, notable music artists perform."

        "title": "Houston Cougars men's basketball",
        "text": "The Houston Cougars men's basketball team represents the University of Houston in Houston, Texas, in the NCAA Division I men's basketball competition. They compete as members of the Big 12 Conference. The program has made six appearances in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament Final Four, which is tied for 10th most all-time, along with the most for any team who has not won a national championship.\nHistory.\nEarly history (1945–56).\nAlthough the University of Houston already had a women's basketball program, the Houston Cougars men's basketball program did not begin until the 1945–46 season. Alden Pasche was the team's first head coach. In their first two seasons, the Cougars won Lone Star Conference regular-season titles and qualified for postseason play in the NAIA Men's Basketball tournaments in 1946 and 1947. The Cougars had an all-time NAIA tournament record of 2–2 in two years.\nDuring Pasche's tenure, the Cougars posted a 135–116 record. Under his leadership in 1950, the Cougars won the Gulf Coast Conference championship. Future College Basketball Hall of Fame coach Guy Lewis played for Pasche, eventually becoming an assistant coach before being handed the job upon Pasche's retirement.\nGuy Lewis era (1956–86).\nPasche retired after the 1955–56 season, and Houston assistant Guy Lewis was promoted to the head coaching position. Lewis, a former Cougar player, led Houston to 27 straight winning seasons and 14 seasons with 20 or more wins, including 14 trips to the NCAA tournament. His Houston teams made the Final Four on five occasions (1967, 1968, 1982–84) and twice advanced to the NCAA Championship Game (1983, 1984). Among the outstanding players who Lewis coached are Elvin Hayes, Hakeem Olajuwon, Clyde Drexler, Otis Birdsong, Dwight Jones, Dwight Davis, Don Chaney and Louis \"Sweet Lou\" Dunbar.\nLewis's UH teams twice played key roles in high-profile events that helped to popularize college basketball as a spectator sport. In 1968, his underdog, Elvin Hayes-led Cougars upset the undefeated and top-ranked UCLA Bruins in front of more than 50,000 fans at Houston's Astrodome. The game became known as the “Game of the Century” and marked a watershed in the popularity of college basketball. In the early 1980s, Lewis's Phi Slama Jama teams at UH gained notoriety for their fast-breaking, \"above the rim\" style of play as well as their overall success. These teams attracted great public interest with their entertaining style of play. At the height of Phi Slama Jama's notoriety, they suffered a dramatic, last-second loss in the 1983 NCAA Final that set a then-ratings record for college basketball broadcasts and became an iconic moment in the history of the sport. Lewis's insistence that these highly successful teams play an acrobatic, up-tempo brand of basketball that emphasized dunking brought this style of play to the fore and helped popularize it amongst younger players.\nHouston lost in both NCAA Final games in which Lewis coached, despite his \"Phi Slama Jama\" teams featuring superstars Clyde Drexler and Hakeem Olajuwon. In 1983, Houston lost in a dramatic title game to the North Carolina State Wolfpack on a last-second dunk by Lorenzo Charles. The Cougars lost in the 1984 NCAA Final to the Georgetown Hoyas, led by Patrick Ewing. Lewis retired from coaching in 1986 at number 20 in all-time NCAA Division I victories, his 592–279 record giving him a .680 career winning percentage.\nAs a coach, Lewis was known for championing the once-outlawed dunk, which he characterized as a \"high percentage shot\", and for clutching a brightly colored red-and-white polka dot towel on the bench during games. Lewis was a major force in the racial integration of college athletics in the South during the 1960s, being one of the first major college coaches in the region to actively recruit African-American athletes. His recruitment of Elvin Hayes and Don Chaney in 1964 ushered in an era of tremendous success in Cougar basketball. The dominant play of Hayes led the Cougars to two Final Fours and sent shock waves through Southern colleges that realized that they would have to begin recruiting black players if they wanted to compete with integrated teams.\nWelcome to Conference USA (1996–2004).\nAfter 21 years in the Southwest Conference, the Cougars joined Conference USA in 1996. Under head coach Alvin Brooks, the basketball program had a disappointing initial season in C-USA. The team went 3–11 against C-USA teams in 1996–97. The next season was even more futile. Brooks, who had led the Cougars since 1993, coached the Cougars to a rock bottom conference record of 2–14 in 1997–98. The last, and only other, time the Cougars recorded only two conference victories in a season was in 1950–51; their first season in the Missouri Valley Conference.\nOne of Houston's biggest sports icons and one of the Cougars best basketball players ever, Clyde Drexler was hired to coach the program that he led as a player to the 1983 NCAA Final as part of Phi Slama Jama. Basketball excitement was back on campus, and fans looked forward to the promising years to come. After just two seasons with minimal success, Drexler resigned as head coach citing his intention to spend more time with his family.\nRay McCallum was hired to do what Clyde Drexler could not—lead the Cougars to a winning season and earn a spot in the NCAA tournament. After losing seasons in each of his first two years, McCallum guided the Cougars to an 18–15 record in 2001–02. That season, the team won two conference tournament games and qualified for the National Invitation Tournament. However, the team regressed in the following season and failed to qualify for even their own C-USA tournament.\nTwo steps forward, one step back (2004–07).\nTom Penders was named as the head coach of Cougars basketball in 2004. Known as \"Turnaround Tom\" for his reputation of inheriting sub-par basketball programs and making them better, Penders was hired to rebuild a program that recorded only one winning season in its last eight years. After a surprising debut season in 2004–05 that led to an NIT appearance, the team had high hopes to build on their relative success and make the NCAA tournament in 2006.\nThe 2005–06 season looked promising at the outset. The Cougars started their first game on a 30–0 scoring run against the Florida Tech Panthers. Less than two weeks later, the Cougars beat the nationally ranked LSU Tigers on the road and the Arizona Wildcats at home. The surprising wins earned the Cougars their first national ranking in several years. The team that seemed destined for an NCAA tournament berth failed to capitalize on their success and national recognition and began to stumble after a loss to South Alabama Jaguars in December. The Cougars won only one conference tournament game and had to settle again for another NIT bid.\nDubbed as \"The Show,\" the 2006–07 Cougars entered the season with cockiness and strong expectations to finally make it into the NCAA tournament. A difficult schedule matched the Cougars with seven different teams that would end up qualifying for either the 2007 NCAA tournament or NIT. Houston lost three times to the Memphis Tigers and once each to Arizona, the Creighton Bluejays, the Kentucky Wildcats, South Alabama, the UNLV Runnin' Rebels, and the VCU Rams. By going 0–9 against these quality teams, the Cougars proved they were not worthy of an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament. Not surprisingly, two conference tournament wins against lower seeds and an unimpressive 18–15 overall record were not even enough to earn the team an invitation to the NIT.\nTeam goal: NCAA tournament (2007–10).\nIn 2007–08 the team introduced a new nickname (\"The Show—In 3D\") and a slightly new uniform (a changed trim design). The team hoped to reach the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1992. Eight straight home games from November 21 to December 29 helped the Cougars get off to an 11–1 start. However, the team lost most of its critical games at the end of the season, including their last two games (both against the UTEP Miners). Houston received an invitation to the inaugural College Basketball Invitational tournament and defeated the Nevada Wolf Pack and the Valparaiso Crusaders but lost to their conference rival, the Tulsa Golden Hurricane, in the semifinal round.\nThe 2008–09 season began on November 11 with a two-point loss to the Georgia Southern Eagles; this was the first game of the Division I college basketball season and the opening game of the 2K Sports Classic tournament in Durham, North Carolina. A Cougars win would have meant a second round matchup with the Duke Blue Devils. Overall, the Cougars played a balanced home and away regular season schedule. Fifteen games (three in November, three in December, four in January, three in February, and two in March) were played at Hofheinz Pavilion. There were 14 away games (two in November, two in December, five in January, and five in February).\nThe 2009–10 team finished the regular season 15–15 and 7–9 in C-USA, finishing seventh place in the conference. Following a 93–80 win over East Carolina in the first round of the C–USA Tournament, the Cougars beat Memphis 66–65, ending a string of four tournament titles for the Tigers. In the next game, they defeated Southern Miss 74–66 to advance to the championship game. Finally, the Cougars beat #25 ranked UTEP 81–73 to earn the conference's bid to the NCAA tournament, their first since 1992. In the first round of the NCAA tournament, Houston, seeded 13th, was defeated 89–77 by 4th-seeded Maryland.\nPenders announced his resignation as Houston head coach on March 22, 2010.\nThe school hired James Dickey on March 21, 2010.\nJoining the American (2013–23).\nBeginning with the 2013–14 season, Houston joined the newly created American Athletic Conference following the Big East realignment.\nIn March 2014, Dickey stepped down as head coach because of \"private family matters\". In four seasons with Houston, Dickey amassed a 64–62 record with no NCAA tournament appearances or conference titles.\nOn April 3, 2014, Houston hired Kelvin Sampson as the new Cougars head coach. Sampson had just become eligible to be a college coach again after receiving a five-year show cause penalty in 2008 for sanctions against him during his time as Indiana head coach. In 2014–15, Sampson's first season, Houston struggled again, finishing with a 13–19 record and 4–14 in the AAC.\nThe 2015–16 team led a resurgence, finishing 22–10 overall, 12–6 in conference, but lost in the AAC tournament and in the first round of the NIT.\nIn 2017–18, the Cougars compiled a 27–8 overall record, reaching the finals of the AAC tournament and winning a game in the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1984.\nIn 2018–19, the Cougars' success continued as they set a program record for wins with a 33–4 mark. They were AAC regular-season champions but fell in the finals of the conference tournament. They proceeded to the NCAA tournament, where they reached the Sweet Sixteen for the first time in 35 years.\nIn 2020–21, the Cougars were ranked as high as No. 5 in the nation. After winning the AAC Tournament, the Cougars were awarded a #2 seed in the NCAA tournament. UH defeated Cleveland State, Rutgers, Syracuse and Oregon State to achieve their first Final Four appearance since 1984. They would lose to eventual national champions Baylor in the Final Four.\nDuring the 2021–22 season, the Cougars won the AAC regular season championship with a 15–3 conference record. They then defeated Cincinnati, Tulane and Memphis to win the conference tournament. With the conference championship, an overall record of 29–5 and ranked No. 15 in the nation, Houston received a #5 seed in the NCAA tournament. In the tournament, UH defeated UAB, Illinois and Arizona before losing to Villanova in the Elite Eight.\nIn 2022–23, the Cougars' last season in the AAC, the team reached the number one ranking in the AP Poll, marking the first time they had held the top spot since 1983.\nHello Big 12.\nIn September 2021, the University of Houston was invited to join the Big 12 Conference, along with Cincinnati, UCF and BYU. The Cougars began Big 12 play in the 2023–24 season. In their first year of play, the Cougars went 32–5 overall, 15–3 in conference play, to claim an outright regular season title.\nTop 25 finishes.\nThe Houston Cougars have finished ranked in the AP Poll and/or the Coaches Poll 16 times in the program's history.\nRivalries.\nRice.\nHouston leads Rice in the series 66–18 through the 2023–24 season.\nSMU.\nHouston leads SMU in the series 58–34 through the 2023–24 season.\nHead coaches.\nNote: Through 2023–24 season. \nPostseason play.\nNCAA Division I tournament results.\nThe Cougars have appeared in 25 NCAA tournaments.

        "title": "2007 Masters of Darts",
        "text": "The 2007 Keukenconcurrent Masters of Darts was the second staging of a Dutch darts tournament featuring five top Dutch and five top English players.\nThe event witnessed a nine dart finish by Dutch teenager Michael van Gerwen, who became the youngest player to achieve the feat on television, aged 17 years and 298 days. Van Gerwen held the record until it was broken by 16-year-old Luke Littler at the 2024 Bahrain Darts Masters. Although the English players won the majority of the matches to clinch the team tournament 15–10, the singles title was won by a Dutchman, Raymond van Barneveld.\nSponsor and venue.\nThe tournament was sponsored by Keukenconcurrent, a Dutch kitchen manufacturing company – who also sponsored many of the top Dutch players. The tournament was held at the Expo Center Hengelo (ECH), a multi functional trade and events centre in Hengelo, Netherlands.\nFormat.\nThe inaugural event in 2005 featured an historic first tournament between players from the BDO and the PDC. This time around the Masters featured an England v the Netherlands clash. At time the tournament details were announced, there were 4 BDO players, 5 PDC players and one unnamed wildcard. Shortly after the 2007 BDO World Championship, the four BDO players (van Gerwen, King, Klaasen and van der Voort) had all announced they were switching to the PDC. So by the time of the 2007 event, all the players in the event were PDC players.\nThe tournament was again arranged by PenH Events, but SBS6 had taken over the contract to cover the event from RTL5, who broadcast the 2005 event. Sky Sports showed highlights of the tournament on 16 July 2007. It was staged between February 10 and February 18, 2007. The Dutch squad consisted of Raymond van Barneveld, Roland Scholten, Vincent van der Voort, Jelle Klaasen and Michael van Gerwen. The England squad was Phil Taylor, Colin Lloyd, Wayne Mardle, Mervyn King and Peter Manley. The players competed in a round-robin format from Saturday to Wednesday.\nThere was no play on Thursday and Friday due to the Holsten Premier League Darts, and the top two players from each country faced off in Saturday's semi-finals. The semi-finals saw the top two Dutch players face each other and the top two English players battling for a place in Sunday's final for the first prize of €50,000. The total prize fund was €185,000.\nResults and review.\nSaturday 10 February, 19:00 UTC (Best of 5 sets) \nMichael van Gerwen produced a superb victory over 13 times World Champion Phil Taylor and was the only Dutchman with a success on the opening day. It was a convincing looking victory by 3 sets to 0 but all three sets went to a deciding leg which van Gerwen took with 14, 12 and 12 dart legs respectively, and there was only one break of throw in the match (the fifth leg of the second set, when Van Gerwen broke Taylor's throw to go 2-0 up in sets). Van Gerwen took out 170 to clinch the second set and also included a 10 dart leg in the third set hitting 180, 133, 180 and double 4 to put himself within one leg of the match. He finished the match with a 164 checkout for the 3–0 win.\nAnother surprise came when Peter Manley beat current World Champion Raymond van Barneveld. Manley took the first set with a 130 checkout in the decider and some steady scoring put him 2-0 up before van Barneveld started a comeback with seven successive legs. Van Barneveld was just one leg from victory but missed darts for the match in the fourth leg. Manley took the next three legs to win the final set 4-2 in the tie-break.\nSunday 11 February, 19:00 UTC (Best of 5 sets) \nRaymond van Barneveld slumped to his second successive defeat in the tournament, and Phil Taylor notched up his first win of 2007 after two draws and two defeats during the year to date. Michael van Gerwen, Mervyn King and Peter Manley maintained their 100% records and Jelle Klaasen got off the mark with his first victory of the tournament. England players extend their lead to 7–3 in match victories, although it is an individual competition with the top two from each nation who progress to the semi-finals.\nMonday 12 February, 19:00 UTC (Best of 5 sets) \nPhil Taylor's miserable form continued with another defeat by Raymond van Barneveld, who finally got off the mark with his first win of the tournament. Peter Manley and Mervyn King maintained their 100% records, which puts Taylor in danger of failing to qualify for the semi-finals. Colin Lloyd notched his second win of the tournament with a thrilling victory over Michael van Gerwen (previously 100%). The match went to a sudden death leg after reaching 5–5 in the final set. Wayne Mardle is still in contention with his second win. England have now won 11 matches to the Netherlands 4.\nTuesday 13 February, 19:00 UTC (Best of 5 sets) \nDespite a win over Jelle Klaasen, Phil Taylor can no longer qualify for the semi-finals. Peter Manley remained 100% with a victory over Roland Scholten, but the other 100% record went as Mervyn King lost to Michael van Gerwen. King hit eight 180s and checked out a 170 finish but it wasn't enough to beat van Gerwen whose victory was enough to secure a semi-final place. Despite only his second win, Raymond van Barneveld also guarantees a semi-final spot with a 3–0 win over Wayne Mardle. With Manley already assured a semi-final place, its down to King, Lloyd and Mardle to battle it out for the final place in the last four. England had an unassailable lead of 14–6 in the team aspect of the tournament.\nWednesday 14 February, 19:00 UTC (Best of 5 sets) \nThe group stages ended with a day of success for the Dutch. Only Michael van Gerwen failed to notch a win for the Netherlands as he lost the opening match of the night to Peter Manley. Manley completed a clean sweep of victories over all five Dutch players, for a significant achievement. Raymond van Barneveld now needed a victory to win the Dutch group and he obliged with a 3–0 win over Colin Lloyd, virtually ending his qualifying hopes. Phil Taylor's dead rubber against Vincent van der Voort ended in defeat, his third of the tournament. Taylor would have the ignominy of finishing bottom of the England group. Wayne Mardle's faint hopes of qualifying vanished with a 0–3 loss to Jelle Klaasen leaving Mervyn King needing just a set against Roland Scholten to go through to the semi-finals. King achieved qualification but blew a 2–0 lead to lose the match 2–3.\nFinal Tables – top two from each group qualified for semi-finals\nThursday &amp; Friday – rest days\nSemi-finals.\nSaturday 17 February, 17:00 UTC (Best of 11 sets) \nMichael van Gerwen achieved a perfect nine dart finish during his defeat by Raymond van Barneveld. van Gerwen became the youngest player to achieve a televised nine-darter, as the event was broadcast live in the Netherlands. His achievement came in the second leg of the fifth set, when trailing 1–3. He took an unconventional route to the nine-darter scoring 174, 180 then finishing 147 with T20, T17, D18. However, he let a 4–3 lead slip and lost the match despite a 104.23 average and fourteen 180s. van Barneveld himself averaged 101.77 and hit eleven 180s to win a dramatic contest.\nEarlier in the evening, Peter Manley produced one of his best comebacks to beat Mervyn King 6-5. Manley trailed 3–5 in sets and was just one leg away from defeat at 0–2 in the ninth set. Three successive ton-plus finishes kept him in the match. King missed a dart to win the match in the tenth set, before Manley took it into a decider.\nKing took the first leg of the deciding set, before Manley levelled. A 70 checkout in the third set against the darts was the decisive moment for Manley and he held out with a double eight in the fourth leg to clinch his final place.\nFinal.\nSunday 18 February, 19:00 UTC (Best of 13 sets)\nThe final was a one-sided affair as Raymond van Barneveld ended Peter Manley's 100% record with a convincing 7–0 victory to take the title. Manley missed four darts to take the second set and level the match but after that was never really in the contest. van Barneveld produced a superb performance averaging almost 108, hitting 60% of his doubles and scored fourteen maximum 180s to dominate the match."

        "text": "Tennis games are often used to help players of all abilities to practice the different strokes involved in tennis. The number of participants needed varies from as few as two players to as many players as can fit on a tennis court. These games are often used by coaches and other tennis instructors to help teach the basic skills of tennis.a substitute shall be allowed to field for any player who may during the match be incapacitated illness or injury, but not for any reason without the consent of the opposing captain.\nSingles Games.\nSingles games are games that practice the strategies used when playing a match of singles.\nOne Ball Live.\nAt least eight players are needed for this game. Two players start on the baseline, the back line of the tennis court, of each side with the court split in half vertically. Two tennis balls are played simultaneously on each half of the court starting with a drop hit. A drop hit is an underhand hit by bouncing the ball first. Once one player loses a point on his or her side of the court, they call out “One ball live!” and the single remaining ball is played out among the four players with the court no longer split down the middle. The team that wins this point stays, while two new players on the other side replace the losing team and the game starts over with two balls. The first team to reach ten points wins. This game is designed for use in practicing groundstrokes, the forehand and backhand, at first and then doubles strategy once \"One ball live\" is called.\nTag Team Singles.\nThis game format can also be used when the number of players drops to 4 in the game \"Around the World\". At least four players are needed for this game. Players are split into two teams. Each team lines up behind the middle of the baseline. One player from each team will start the game off and step up to the baseline. Either player can start the point. Once a player has hit the ball, he or she goes to the end of their line and the next player in line will hit their team's next shot. The same happens for the other team. The rally continues until one team makes a mistake. This version is designed to work on consistency in the players ground strokes.\nRelay or Tag Tennis.\nRelay / Tag Tennis is a tennis game that encourages teamwork and participation at all levels. It can be played as singles or doubles, on any size of court and at any level of play.\nPlayers are split into two teams. Each team lines up behind the baseline, or somewhere on the court that is safe. One player from the serving team starts the game and plays the point according to existing and traditional rules and etiquette of tennis. Every player or doubles pair plays out at least one whole rally. Once a player has played their rally/rallies, they go to the end of their line and the next player in line plays their team's next point/rally.\nScoring can be traditional (15/30/40/Deuce/Advantage/Game), Tie Break, Ping Pong or any net/wall game scoring format. To ensure every player/doubles pair faces every opponent player/team, when the number of players/teams on opposite sides is equal, the serving team should stay on for two points/rallies, while the receiving team stay on for one point/rally.\nAny existing tournament and league competition infrastructure can be used to run a Relay / Tag tennis competition.\nKing of the Court.\nThree or more players are needed for this game. One person, designated as the “king” or “queen,” goes to the opposite side of the court. The other players make a line behind the baseline of the current side. One challenger steps up and plays a singles point against the “king.” The point is started with either a serve or a drop hit. If the challenger wins, they replace the “king” on the other side of the court. Variations of this game include the challenger having to win two or three points in a row. This game practices playing a singles point.\nChamps and Chumps.\nSix or more players are needed for this game. An equal number of players line up behind each baseline. One side is designated the chumps while the other is designated the champs. A player from each line steps up and plays out a singles point. The point is started with either a drop hit or a serve. The winner of the point goes to the end of the champs’ line while the loser goes to the end of the chumps' line. The game is played for a designated time, and once time is called, the players on the champs side are the winners. This game practices playing a singles point.\nOn-Off Singles.\nThis was designed when there is a lack of courts. If singles is preferred, over doubles with 4 players. 2 players face off in a separate match and the other 2 have a separate match. The two matches share the court with each match alternating play per point. (two people play their singles point, then alternate as the other two players play their singles point).\nDoubles Games.\nDoubles games are games that practice the different strategies used in a match of doubles.\nTeam Doubles.\nSix or more players are needed for this game. Four players line up in the typical doubles starting positions. The typical doubles starting positions are with one player serving and his partner on the other side of his side of the court at the net. The returning team has a player at the service line in front of the server and a player at the baseline on the other side of the court. The other players wait to play in a line behind the serving or returning players. One team serves the ball and the point is played out. Once the point is over, each side of the court rotates. On the serving side: the server rotates to the net position, the net player sits out, and a new player steps in to serve the ball. On the returning side: the return player rotates to the service line, service line player sits out, and a new player steps in to return the ball. The same team serves the ball until the game is over. The game is played until a team reaches seven or eleven points. Variations in the game include a drop hit to start the point or a coach feeding the ball to start the point. This game is designed to give each player practice at all the doubles positions.\nAll Position Doubles.\nEight or more players are needed for this game. Four players start the first point in the normal doubles starting position. A line of one or more players is to the side of each starting position. The first point is played. Once finished, the first four players rotate in a clockwise direction to the end of the next line. Four new players play out the next point and then rotate in the same manner. The first person to win a total of 10 points wins the game. This game is designed to give each player practice at all the doubles positions.\nKing of the Court Doubles.\nSix or more players are needed for this game. One team of two players is designated as the “kings” or “queens” and goes to one side of the court. The other players make a line behind the baseline of the opposite side. One challenging team steps up and plays a doubles point against the “kings.” The point is started with either a serve or a drop hit. If the challengers win, they replace the “kings” on the other side of the court. Variations of this game include the challengers having to win two or three points in a row. This game practices playing a point of doubles.\nRush N' Crush.\nThis game either requires an even number of players 4 or more, or any number of players more than 2 along with an individual ball feeder. The game is traditionally played with doubles teams. A doubles team is designated the rulers and begins on the baseline on the opposite side of the court. The feeder is positioned behind the rulers with respectable space to the rulers for mobility (at least 10 feet behind the line). The other doubles teams are the challengers and take turns on the opposite side of the court with a goal to win 3 points in a row to replace the current rulers. As each point begins, the rulers begin at the baseline, but are free to move anywhere once the point begins. The first point begins with the feeder feeding a short ball to the challengers allowing them to proceed to the net and an offensive. If the challengers win the first point, they remain at the net for the beginning of the next two points (they are allowed free mobility after the point begins). The feeder will randomly designate one player on the challengers team to receive an overhead (a short lob allowing the player to hit a powerful shot similar to a serve from the net), or a volley. With the third point, the other of the two challengers receives an overhead or a volley. If all three points are won the challengers take the place as the new rulers and the previous rulers proceed to the challenger's side. After a certain time, end game may be called and the current rulers are designated as the winners (The power to call end game may go to the feeder). This game was designed to train and encourage aggressiveness and a goal in doubles to move to the net to finish the point. It also trains groundstrokes volleys, and overheads, along with possible use of slices and drop-shots.\nA super-shot rule may also be put into effect. Here, a feeder may decide at a random time (either\n or 3rd point) to drive a volley between the two challengers. If neither player touches the ball it is called a super-shot and the challengers could be penalized (may run laps, do pushups etc.). With this rule, the game also trains communication between a doubles.\nTriples.\nPlayers are divided into teams of three to six players. Each team forms a triangle on each side of the court with one person at the net. Extra players wait behind the baseline. A ball is fed by a coach or player that is sitting out and the point is played using the doubles court. Once the point is over, players rotate clockwise on their respective sides. If there are more than three players, rotate players in and out. The first team to ten points wins. This game is designed to help the net player become more aggressive at the net.\nMonkey in the Middle.\nThis game is played in triples formation (a triangle with two players behind the baseline and the third in the team at the net). The game can be played with a feeder positioned off of the court, usually by the net, or without the feeder. A point is begun by feeding the ball to one of the baseline players on either team. The point is played out. Each point is worth one point. If the net player (also known as the monkey), hits a winner, the player earns his/her team 2 points. The next point is begun with a ball being fed to the opposite side of the team that just won the point(s). Games are played to any score 10n + 1 (ex: 11, 21, 31 etc.).\nDeep Desperation.\nTwo players go to the baseline of one side of the court as the champs. Two other players go to the net on the opposite side of the champs. These are the challengers. The other players wait at the side of the net post in pairs ready to replace the challengers. The coach lobs a ball over the challenger's heads and the challengers have to run down the lob and play out the point (after it bounces). If the challengers win the point, they replace the champs and the old champs go to the end of the challengers line. If they lose, they go to the back of the challenger's line at the net post. This game is designed to practice running down a lob and getting back into the point. This game is also designed to promote net play and aggressiveness, and shot placement.\nWipe Out.\nPlayers are divided into two teams and wait with one team behind each baseline. One player from each team steps up and a singles point is played out starting with a drop hit. The person that wins adds another player from their team to the court while the player that loses goes to the end of their line and a new player replaces him or her. This next point is played one vs. two with the team with only one person on the court starting the ball. The team with one person on the court can use the doubles court while the team with multiple people on the court has to use the singles court. If the team with two people on the court wins, they add another player and play one vs. three. If they lose, all players on the court on that team go to the end of the line and one player replaces them. The other team, the winning team, adds another player to the court. If playing against one player, singles court must be used. If playing against two or more players, doubles court can be used. The game continues until an entire team is on the court and wins the point. This game is designed to practice ball placement.\nAround the World.\nFour or more players are needed for this game. The players are split up evenly on each side of the court and line up behind the baseline. One player from each side steps up to the baseline. Either player feeds the ball and runs to the end of the line on the other side of the court. The person that receives the feed hits the ball and also runs to the end of the line on the other side of the court. The next person in line will hit the next shot and so on. The point continues until an error is made. This process is repeated. Once a person has made three errors, he or she sits out. The last person to make three errors wins. Once the game is down to two people, instead of running to the other side, the person has to hit the ball, drop their racquet, spin around, and continue the point. This game is designed to practice hitting that first shot of each point without first being in a rhythm.\nTouch the Curtain.\nThis game requires that there is a wall behind both baselines on the court. 4 individual players take the court with 2 on each side positioned at the baseline. Any extra players will line up by the net post as substitutes. The game also requires a feeder, one who will stand out of the game with a large basket of balls quickly putting a new ball into play once the previous ball is out of play. When the game begins, the 4 players on the court rally the ball back and forth with freedom of mobility and aggressiveness. Each player's main goal is to not be eliminated from the game by falling to a winner (a ball that bounces on the player's court twice). When an individual player mishits the ball, the player is substituted with the next person in line while the feeder immediately puts a ball into play to the opposite (unharmed) side. When a winner is hit, the player within whose court the ball lands (half the court being divided vertically as well), this player is eliminated from the game (it is also popular that a super-shot, or a winner hit through the middle of the court without a definite decision to which player is eliminated, results in both players on that side being eliminated from the game). As more eliminations occur the number of substitutes decrease. When only 4 players remain in the game (no substitutes) a mistake is penalized with the player running back and touching the wall behind the baseline while a ball is put into play in the opposite side allowing the other duo to hit a winner. With 3 players remaining, the same rules apply but the single player only needs to defend a singles court. When 2 players remain, they can decide between themselves to touch the wall, or any other penalty (Dropping the racquet and spinning a full circle is a popular penalty). With that set rule, the 2 players play on a complete singles court until one player remains to be designated the winner. Once a new game begins, the highest ranking players from the previous game usually begin as the substitutes with the winner substituting last, and the runner-up substituting next to last etc. This game is designed to work on the advanced skill of consistency after running to a shot, shot placement, and builds stamina."

The Vikings were upset by the Kansas City Chiefs, 23-7, on January 11, 1970, at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans. Washington was one of the fifteen plaintiffs in \"Mackey v. National Football League\" in which Judge Earl R. Larson declared that the Rozelle rule was a violation of antitrust laws on December 30, 1975. He is the subject of the documentary, \"Through the Banks of the Red Cedar\", written and directed by his daughter Maya Washington."

        "text": "Michael John \"Mick\" Hancock (born 21 October 1969) is an Australian former rugby league footballer who played in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. An Australian international and Queensland State of Origin representative , he played in the Brisbane Broncos' first five Grand Final victories in 1992, 1993, 1997 Super League, 1998 and 2000. At the time of his retirement from football in Australia in 2000 he held the Broncos' club records for most career appearances. He played out the rest of his career in England with the Salford City Reds and retired in 2002.\nEarly career.\nHancock started out playing in the under 16's/18's and A Grade in the Toowoomba rugby league for the Stanthorpe Gremlins.\nThe young , Hancock starred as a 17-year-old for the Toowoomba Clydesdales in the Winfield State League.\nFirst grade career.\nIn 1988, Hancock joined the Brisbane Broncos for the club's initial season in the New South Wales Rugby League premiership as a member of the first Brisbane run-on team that thrashed defending premiers the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles 44–10 in 1988's season opener at Brisbane's Lang Park in a side that included representative players Wally Lewis (captain), Colin Scott, Joe Kilroy, Gene Miles, Allan Langer, Bryan Niebling, Greg Dowling and Greg Conescu.\nIn 1989, Hancock made his début for the Queensland Maroons, becoming the then-youngest footballer of either state to play in a State of Origin series and scored two tries in the 36–6 win over NSW at Lang Park. He then made his Test début on the 1989 mid-season tour of New Zealand while still a teenager. Having already represented his state in all three matches of that year's Origin series, he also played in all six matches on the New Zealand tour, scoring three tries. He played in all three Tests against the Kiwis and scored his first try in test football in Australia's 8–0 win in the second test at the Rotorua International Stadium on 16 July. He was known for his strength, elusiveness and a wide-legged running style that allowed him to change direction sharply and sometimes several times as he approached opposition defences. Hancock was named the 1989 Brisbane Broncos season's rookie of the year.\n1990s.\nIn 1990 Hancock missed the one-off Test against France with a hamstring injury, but regained his spot on the wing for the test against New Zealand in Wellington where he scored a try in Australia's 24–6 win. He was then selected for the 1990 Kangaroo Tour of Great Britain and France at the end of the 1990 NSWRL season. Unfortunately, an ankle injury suffered in Australia's 19–14 loss to Great Britain in the first test loss at Wembley, London limited him to just six games on the English leg of the tour and he lost his test spot to Broncos teammate Dale Shearer. The first test loss was something of a disaster for Hancock as his opposite winger Paul Eastwood crossed for two of the Lions three tries on the day. Although he returned to action, before the second Ashes series test, scoring a try in a 36–18 win over Halifax, Shearer's form was such (scoring a try in the Aussies 14–10 win at Old Trafford in the second test) that Hancock was unable to regain his test spot for the remainder of the tour.\nIn 1991 he was overlooked for the mid-season Trans Tasman tests against New Zealand, nor could he gain a spot on the end of season tour of Papua New Guinea. He later regained his Test spot and played in all three Ashes tests against Great Britain during the 1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, helping Australia retain The Ashes. At the end of the year Hancock was a member of the Broncos team that defeated the St George Dragons 28–8 in the 1992 Winfield Cup Grand Final. He then traveled to England where he played on the wing in Australia's 10–6 win over Great Britain in the 1992 World Cup final in front of 73,631 fans at Wembley Stadium, London. Hancock had a solid game in the WCF, keeping St. Helens winger Alan Hunte quiet. A week after the Final, Hancock scored two tries in Brisbane's 22–8 victory over English champions Wigan in the 1992 World Club Challenge at Central Park. In winning the Broncos became the first Australian team to win the World Club Challenge on British soil.\nHancock made his second tour of New Zealand in 1993, playing all three tests of the 1993 Trans-Tasman series and scoring his 5th and final test try in the third test at Lang Park. He played in Brisbane's second consecutive premiership win in 1993, again defeating St George in the Grand Final. During the 1994 NSWRL season, Hancock played at centre for Brisbane when they lost 20–14 against Wigan in the 1994 World Club Challenge in front of a WCC record attendance of 54,220 at Brisbane's ANZ Stadium.\nMichael Hancock played his last test for Australia in 1994 against France in a 58–0 win at the Parramatta Stadium in Sydney. Called into the team after injury ruled out Broncos teammate Willie Carne, Hancock didn't score in the game but made a number of breaks and almost always had the hapless French grasping at air trying to tackle him. After being selected for his second Kangaroo Tour in 1994, his test career ended when he injured his shoulder in a training mishap only a week before the first Ashes test at Wembley. In a case of Déjà vu with 1990, he would return to the field before the tour ended, but wasn't able to regain his test place either on tour or in the following years.\n2000s.\nThe advent of the unlimited interchange rule prolonged Hancock's career, with coach Wayne Bennett opting to use him as an impact player on the wing or in the . The last of the foundation players to leave the club, it was only fitting then, in his thirteenth season with the same club, that he left the Broncos after the 14–6 victory over the Sydney Roosters in the 2000 NRL grand final to play out the rest of his career for Salford in England. Also in 2000 Hancock was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in the sport of rugby league. At the time of his retirement, he held the record for most appearances for the Broncos until Darren Lockyer surpassed him in 2007, and was number two on the club's all-time top try-scorers list with 120 (second only to Steve Renouf's 142).\nPost-playing.\nIn 2003, Hancock was one of the first four former players inducted into the Broncos official Hall of Fame. During the 2007 season at the Broncos' 20-year anniversary celebration, the club announced a list of the 20 best players to play for them to date which included Hancock.\nIn 2008, rugby league in Australia's centenary year, Hancock was named on the wing in the Toowoomba and South West Team of the Century.\nHancock has been involved in rugby league development encouraging children to take up the sport."

He represented Australia internationally and New South Wales in State of Origin, and played club football in Australia for the Penrith Panthers, South Sydney Rabbitohs, Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles and in England for the .\nBiography.\nCarroll was born in Greystanes, New South Wales on 26 February 1967. He started out playing junior rugby league football for the Penrith Panthers.\nPlaying career.\nCarroll was a member of the Penrith Panthers 1987 reserve grade premiers. He played in three seasons of first grade at Penrith between 1987 and 1989.\nCarroll found immediate success after moving to South Sydney Rabbitohs in 1990, earning him a surprise selection as a reserve for the one-off Test against France at Parkes, New South Wales (having not yet played at State of Origin level). At the end of the 1990 NSWRL season, he went on the 1990 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France but made only six appearances due to a knee injury. He played with South Sydney Rabbitohs for four seasons between 1990 and 1993.\nCarroll moved to Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in 1994, but despite being a shadow player for New South Wales and the Australian Test team, he failed to make a second Kangaroo Tour at the end of the year.\nCarroll's representative career gained a boost with the Super League split in 1995 when he won a belated NSW jersey.\nDespite being suspended for a stiff-arm tackle on David Furner and missing the State of Origin match in Melbourne, he was selected for Australia to play against New Zealand. A member of Australia's victorious World Cup team in 1995, Carroll's appearances against New Zealand, Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Rest of the World teams over the next two years boosted his Test total to 12 matches. He is listed on the \"Australian Players Register\" as Kangaroo No. 600.\nWhile Carroll obviously enjoyed playing in a stronger pack at Manly, three consecutive grand Final appearances (1995–97) garnered just the one premiership success, in 1996.\nAt the end of 1997, Carroll left Manly to play for the but the move was not a success and he cited homesickness as the reason for his return.\nHe re-joined South Sydney Rabbitohs in 1999 and was an important part of the club's early season resurgence. Recalled to rep football in the Second State of Origin match that year, he was knocked out in the series decider after a controversial tackle by Jason Smith.\nPost playing.\nForced to retire at season's end because of chronic knee injury, Carroll became a committed supporter of South Sydney Rabbitohs' reinstatement into the NRL in 2002.\nIn 2000, Carroll was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league. He has since gained some notoriety as the international bodyguard of actor Russell Crowe.\nIn June 2020, Carroll advised listeners on 2GB and FoxSports that Paul Gallen was a drug cheat and coward and that he got off lightly for his involvement during the Cronulla Sharks supplement scandal. After the comment, several NRL lounge chair commentators, including Darwin resident, AB, suggested Spud run as Prime Minister. \"Spud's a legend, Spud for PM!\" AB said. "

        "text": "Paul Gregory Green (12 September 1972 – 11 August 2022) was an Australian professional rugby league football coach, best known for taking the North Queensland Cowboys to the NRL premiership in 2015, and a professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1990s and 2000s.\nHe played for Cronulla-Sutherland, North Queensland Cowboys, Sydney Roosters, Parramatta Eels and the Brisbane Broncos, winning the Rothmans Medal in 1995. He was a Queensland State of Origin and Australian international representative halfback. As a coach, Green guided the North Queensland club to their first premiership in 2015 and to another grand final two years later.\nPlaying career.\nEarly years.\nBorn in Brisbane, Queensland, Green was a Wynnum Manly Seagulls junior. He captained the Queensland Colts before winning Brisbane Rugby League's Rothmans Medal in 1993 while playing for the Easts Tigers. Green's Tigers lost the 1993 BRL Grand Final 18–12 to Western Suburbs, despite Green scoring a try for the Eastern Suburbs side.\nCronulla-Sutherland Sharks.\nIn 1994, Green followed his Easts' coach John Lang to Sydney's Cronulla-Sutherland, turning heads with the maturity and skill of his play at . In his rookie season in the NSWRL, Green played 24 games. In 1995, he backed up his solid debut season by winning the ARL's prestigious Rothmans Medal (which has since become the Dally M Medal) as best and fairest player.\nFollowing Cronulla's defection to Super League, Green was selected for Australia as a reserve in the 1997 ANZAC Test, before representing Queensland as a replacement in three Super League Tri-series matches. At the end of the season, he was chosen as halfback in the return Test against New Zealand in September, but an injury kept him out of Australia's tour of Great Britain. After missing just one match in four seasons, a serious shoulder injury restricted Green to just four matches in 1998.\nNorth Queensland Cowboys.\nIn 1999, Green joined the North Queensland Cowboys and was the starting halfback for most of the year. That season he became the club's first State of Origin representative, when he was selected as Queensland's halfback for Game 2 of the series. In 2000, Green fell out of favour with coach Tim Sheens who preferred the halves' partnership of Scott Prince and Noel Goldthorpe. Despite this, Green once again represented Queensland. The Cowboys then sacked Green midway through the season for allegedly negotiating with other clubs while still under contract. Green would subsequently win an out-of-court settlement against the club.\nSydney Roosters.\nIn 2001, Green returned to Sydney, joining the Sydney Roosters. That season he played 19 games, starting 17 of them at halfback and earned another Origin recall, playing in all three games in Queensland's series win. In 2002, Green injured his knee in the Roosters' opening game against the South Sydney Rabbitohs, ruling him out for the whole of the Roosters' premiership-winning season.\nParramatta Eels.\nIn 2003, Green joined the Parramatta Eels. After starting the first 7 games at halfback, Green fractured his cheekbone which ended his season.\nBrisbane Broncos.\nGreen returned to Queensland in 2004, signing with the Brisbane Broncos. After spending most of the season in the Queensland Cup, he made five appearances for the Broncos towards the end of the season before retiring.\nCoaching career.\nAfter his playing retirement in 2004, Green began his coaching career in 2005 as a specialist coach with the Brisbane Broncos, mainly working with the club's halves and hookers. This continued until 2008, and in 2009 he was promoted to be an assistant coach of the Brisbane Broncos. Green moved on to feeder club Wynnum Manly Seagulls in 2010, coaching them in the 2011 and 2012 Queensland Cups, winning back-to-back premierships.\nIn 2012, Green was appointed head coach of representative team the Queensland Residents, which consists of the best players and coach from the Queensland Cup competition, and beat the New South Wales Residents.\nIn 2013, he was appointed head coach of the Sydney Roosters Toyota Cup Under 20s team and an assistant coach to the NRL side. The Roosters won the 2013 NRL premiership while Green's NYC side made the preliminary finals in the Under 20s competition.\nDuring the build-up to NRL Grand Final week in 2015, then Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett explained that he had held Green's coaching career back. With the inaugural season of the Under 20s competition set to get underway, Bennett said the North Queensland mentor was in line for the role of coach. Ultimately it went to ex Penrith Panthers coach Anthony Griffin.\nNorth Queensland Cowboys.\nIn 2014, Green commenced his NRL head coaching career with the North Queensland Cowboys, claiming the club's first title at the inaugural NRL Auckland Nines, defeating the Brisbane Broncos in the Grand Final. Green took the Cowboys to within a whisker of the top 4 finish in 2014. They finished the season with 15 wins, in fifth place. During the season Green made some decisions which analysts saw as defining the Cowboys' quality season, including shifting halfback Michael Morgan to the fullback position, switching captain Johnathan Thurston from five-eighth back to the halfback position and giving young gun Jason Taumalolo a spot in the starting line-up.\nThe 2014 finals series saw the Cowboys eliminated in controversial fashion once again. After defeating the eighth placed Brisbane Broncos 32–20 in week one of the finals series, North Queensland travelled to Sydney to take on the Sydney Roosters, and lost the match 31–30. A last minute try to Johnathan Thurston which would have given them victory was disallowed by the video referees. After trailing 30–0 in the early stages of the first half, Green said in the post match press conference that the team should not lick their wounds over the controversial call which ended their season as their start was not good enough to deserve the win. Green finished the season coaching the North Queensland side to 16 wins from 26 starts.\nGreen broke records with North Queensland in 2015. After the club started their season with three losses, Green then went on to take the club to 11 wins in a row. The Cowboys finished the year with the most wins they had ever recorded in the regular season: 17. They had their first top 4 finish since 2007.\nNorth Queensland lost 16–12 against the Brisbane Broncos in week 1 of the finals series, before putting in the most clinical display from a single club all year in the following week's semi-final against Cronulla. The Cowboys won that match 39–0. Then came the Preliminary Final, their first since 2007. The Cowboys beat the Melbourne Storm 32–12 in that match, booking their place in the 2015 NRL Grand Final against the Brisbane Broncos. It was their first Grand Final in a decade; they had finished runners-up in 2005. The Cowboys claimed their maiden premiership with a 17–16 win over the Brisbane Broncos. This made Green the first coach in history to defeat the Brisbane Broncos in a Grand Final, a team which had a perfect record going into the game with 6 wins from 6 attempts.\nIn December 2015, Green was offered the vacant head coaching role of the Queensland State of Origin side. Green ultimately turned down the job to concentrate solely on the Cowboys.\nOn 22 February 2016 Green coached the Cowboys to their first World Club Championship victory defeating Leeds 34–4. In the regular NRL season, Green would coach the Cowboys to win their first five home games in a row, a club record. North Queensland finished the regular season in fourth place on the ladder. In week one of the finals the club lost to the Melbourne Storm 16–10 before defeating the Brisbane Broncos 26–20 in a 90-minute thriller in the Semi-Finals in a match rated the best of the season. Green and the Cowboys fell short in the preliminary finals losing to the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks 32–20, falling just one game short of a second consecutive Grand Final. Green coached the Cowboys to their best ever defensive season in the NRL in 2016, conceding the fewest points in club history with just 355 in the regular season, an average of 14.79 points per game.\nAfter opening the 2017 season with two consecutive golden point victories against Canberra and Brisbane, Green was courted by the NZRL to become assistant coach of the New Zealand Rugby League Test Team for the 2017 World Cup. The Cowboys limped into the 2017 Finals series in 8th place after an injury crisis saw co-captains Matthew Scott and Johnathan Thurston ruled out early in the season. The Cowboys were able to upset reigning premiers the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in the Qualifying Finals, the Parramatta Eels in the Semi-Finals and the Sydney Roosters in the Preliminary Finals to secure a spot in the Grand Final against the Melbourne Storm. In Green's second grand final, his injury-depleted side would fall short 34–6. Green was widely praised for getting North Queensland into their second grand final in the space of three seasons; at one stage, in rounds 23–24, he had 17 players out with injury.\n2018 wasn't Green's best season in charge of North Queensland. After winning the pre-season Johnathan Thurston and Cameron Smith testimonial against the Melbourne Storm, many predicted a premiership season for the club but by the end of the season and a host of injuries, the side finished 13th on the ladder with just 8 wins and 16 losses. The club's biggest win of the year was over the Brisbane Broncos in Round 22 where they took home the Queensland Derby shield.\nFollowing a strong pre-season in 2019 with wins over Melbourne and the Gold Coast, Paul Green became the coach with most wins in club history when his side defeated the Warriors in Round 6. The club won three games in a row for the first time since 2017 following their Round 12 victory over the Gold Coast Titans in which the side prevailed 6–4.\nIn February 2020, Green led the Cowboys' to their second NRL Nines championship, after they defeated the St George Illawarra Dragons in the final.\nOn 20 July 2020, after a disappointing start, Green stepped down from his role as Cowboys' head coach just 10 games into the season.\nQueensland.\nGreen was appointed as head coach of Queensland for the 2021 State of Origin series. In game one of the series, Queensland were defeated 50–6 by New South Wales at Queensland Country Bank Stadium in Townsville.\nIn game two of the series, Queensland were defeated 26–0 by New South Wales at Suncorp Stadium putting Green under intense media scrutiny.\nQueensland came back to win the game three, with Green's side defeating New South Wales 20–18 at Cbus Super Stadium on the Gold Coast.\nPersonal life.\nGreen was married to Amanda and had two children. He played the violin and was a pilot of both fixed-wing planes and helicopters.\nDeath.\nGreen died by suicide at his Wynnum, Brisbane, home on 11 August 2022, aged 49.\nGreen's brain was donated to the Australian Sports Brain Bank, with his family posting on the website \"In memory of our beloved Paul, we ask that you support the pioneering work of the Australian Sports Brain Bank\" with a goal of raising monies for further understanding of the concussion-related condition chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). A post-mortem examination revealed that Green had one of the most \"severe forms\" of CTE. Professor Michael Buckland said Green had \"an organic brain disease which robbed him of his decision-making and impulse control.\" He added Green would likely have been \"symptomatic for some time.\""

Prior to attending ESU, Anderson was a junior college All-American at Mid-Plains College in North Platte, Nebraska, and then an All-District and All-Area outfielder at University of Nebraska at Kearney.\nCareer.\nUpon completing his bachelor's degree in physical education, Anderson began his coaching career at Emporia State while working on his master's in science with an emphasis in exercise physiology. He helped the Hornets reach the 1984 NAIA World Series and then accepted the assistant coaching position at Howard College in Big Spring, Texas, in 1987. Over his three seasons there, the Hawks not only ranked among the top 20 junior colleges in the country, but also had 26 of Anderson's pupils drafted by major league clubs.\nPrior to serving as head coach for the Cowboys, Anderson was an assistant coach for the Texas Longhorns from 2000 to 2003 and pitching coach with the Texas Tech Red Raiders from 1990 to 1999.\nAt Oklahoma State, Anderson's team won the 2004 Big 12 Conference baseball tournament. In 2005, his team went 34–25, including an upset over the top ranked Texas Longhorns. In 2006, OSU went 41–20, and earned a number 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. His program reached a national ranking of 12th. In his final four seasons he had an overall record of 130–100 overall (44–58 in the Big 12). After his team failed to qualify for the NCAA tournament, Anderson was fired on May 29, 2012. In July 2012, Anderson was hired as the pitching coach for the Houston Cougars. On June 14, 2017, it was announced that Anderson would become the pitching coach for the Tennessee Volunteers.\nFrank Anderson and his wife Sandra have two children: a son, Brett, who is a starting pitcher in Major League Baseball, and a daughter, Katelyn."

        "title": "Harry Simmons (baseball)",
        "text": "Harry Simmons (September 29, 1907 – January 14, 1998) was an American professional baseball executive, writer and historian. He worked in Minor League Baseball for the International League from 1946 until 1966, first in New York City then in Montreal. He then worked in Major League Baseball for the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball until his retirement in 1982. Simmons was nicknamed \"Mr. Baseball\" and is an inductee of the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.\nBiography.\nSimmons' early interests in baseball derived from the Sunday afternoon games he attended with his father. After graduating from Morris High School in The Bronx, he worked in several jobs while developing a deep interest in baseball history, rules, and statistics. By the 1930s, he was spending a lot of his free time in the New York Public Library researching old newspapers about the early accounts of matches. At that time, he developed a friendship with Ernest Lanigan, a baseball historian and Information Director of the International League.\nDuring the 1930s, Simmons developed a deep interest in baseball statistics and history. He was the first to compile 19th century win-lost records for pitchers in the National League. The guides of that period had not published this information. He carefully checked each box score of each game listed in the newspapers of that era: \"Sporting Life\" and \"The Sporting News\". The results were published over several issues of \"Baseball Magazine\".\nFrom 1940 to 1942, Simmons selected the top baseball performer of the day for the popular radio show \"Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians.\" While in the United States Army, he continued his research and while at Camp Pickett, Virginia, was able to work at the Library of Congress in Washington, where he compiled records from 1876, debuts of prominent players, batting records of pitchers, rare fielding gems and items for \"The Sporting News\" record book. He contributed original work to the top baseball writers of the day: J. G. Taylor Spink, Leonard Gettlson, Hy Turkin, S. C. Thompson, and Lee Allen. He studied journalism at Columbia University in New York on the G.I. Bill after leaving the army.\nIn 1951, Simmons was called as an expert witness to testify before a congressional committee on the history of the reserve clause. The Celler House Judiciary Committee probed monopoly influences in organized baseball. In 1965, he appeared in the CBS television show \"To Tell The Truth\" and managed to receive no votes when asked, \"Will the real Mr. Simmons please stand up\". In 1968, Simmons contributed a 26,710 word essay on the topic of baseball which was printed in the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" for many years.\nInternational League.\nSimmons joined the International League during the 1946 season. On his first day on the job, league president Frank Shaughnessy asked him to go to Baltimore to present Sherm Lollar with the league's Most Valuable Player Award for the 1945 season, when Lollar had a .364 batting average with 34 home runs. Simmons hopped on a train and in front of 45,000 fans made the presentation that afternoon. He indicated that he was extremely nervous speaking in front of a crowd that size. That year, Jackie Robinson joined the Montreal Royals, and Simmons became quite involved in handling the press in its hunger for stories about Robinson.\nWhen Simmons started at the International League, he held conferences for the umpires of the league to discuss the rules and review calls which had been made. He soon realized that some of the umpires were of the opinion that they \"don't have to know the right\nanswer unless the managers do\". He started to compile some of these odd plays which the umpires would ask him about, and in 1949, he submitted \"a pack of these nutcrackers\" to \"The Saturday Evening Post\" under the title \"So You Think You Know Baseball\". The series became very popular; one of the solutions brought 7,000 letters of protest to the magazine. Nearly all were actually plays, \"though a few were the results of bad dreams\". The series ran until 1961, and later was published in \"Baseball Digest\". The series was published in book form, first in 1960, and sold 500,000 copies in many editions.\nOver the years, Simmons gained more International League responsibilities in handling player trades, dealing with the press, scheduling the games, the hiring, firing and movement of the umpires, settling disputes among the clubs, handling the financial side of league operations, and staffing the office. During the late 1950s, Shaughnessy became frequently ill, and Simmons was essentially running the league by himself.\nIn early 1953, the league office was moved to Shaughnessy's home town of Montreal. Simmons quickly became a popular figure in Montreal baseball circles and gave many speeches to local community groups. He made many close friends among the sports writers and sport figures in both Montreal and Toronto. He moved his family north in 1954 to settle in the suburb of Cartierville, Quebec. The family retained this residence until 1995.\nOne of Simmons' tasks at the International League was to develop the league schedule. In March 1953, when the Boston Braves moved to Milwaukee, National League president Warren Giles called on Simmons for some quick schedule changes. The next year found Simmons developing both the American League and National League schedules. He was the major league schedule maker from then until 1982, when the required travel started to take its toll. Simmons also completed the schedules for numerous minor leagues, the Canadian Football League, soccer leagues, and international hockey tournaments.\nAfter the 1960 season, when the Montreal Royals folded (becoming the Syracuse Chiefs) and Shaughnessy retired, the league offices were moved back to New York City. Simmons received consideration to succeed Shaughnessy, but the position went to Tommy Richardson, then president of the Eastern League. Simmons, who remained with the International League through the 1965 season, decided to keep his residence in Montreal; he regularly spent three days a week in Montreal until retiring from his subsequent role with Major League Baseball.\nCommissioner's Office.\nIn late January 1966, Simmons resigned from the International League and took a role in the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball. His official duties included supervision of club player contracts, co-ordination of retirement plans for both leagues, player service and pension records. He frequently was called upon for advice from the Commissioner and wrote speeches for the many functions attended by commissioners William Eckert and Bowie Kuhn. He acted as a general consultant to club owners and general managers who needed advice. He also served on the Major League Rules Committee for many years, where he suggested changes and wrote new rules.\nSince Simmons had many friends in the baseball circles in Montreal, and knew everyone of importance in the game, it was only natural that he was called upon for assistance when the city was ready for a major league franchise, the Montreal Expos. He directed Gerry Snyder of the mayor's office on how to go about getting the franchise and recommended the hiring of Jim Fanning and John McHale to run the club.\nJim Fanning, former general manager of the Expos, wrote:\n\"During Mr. Simmons time as a baseball executive every Major League owner and executive knew him on a first name basis. He not only was a keen advisor to the commissioners he worked for, but was a counsel and advisor to Major League Executives as well. Mr. Simmons was unheralded—his picture never made the cover of \"The Sporting News\"—but I had an office next to his when I started the Major League Scouting Bureau, and I witnessed this man's contribution day after day. His contributions were an equal to any who graced the cover of a sports magazine.\"\nDeath and legacy.\nIn 1979, Simmons was awarded the \"King of Baseball\" title at the annual baseball Winter Meetings, held in Toronto. This prestigious award is given annually to an individual who has made a major contribution to Major League baseball.\nIn 1990, Simmons was awarded the SABR Salute, which is given to a member whose research has contributed significantly to baseball knowledge.\nSimmons died at a care center in New Canaan, Connecticut, in January 1998 at age 90.\nin 2007, Simmons was elected to the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in Israel.\nCanadian Baseball Hall of Fame.\nIn 2002, Simmons was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.\nIn the more than 50 years that he was involved in baseball, Simmons collected thousands of items related to the development of the game from its earliest times. These included his correspondence with people involved in every level of the game; memos, letters, and speeches from the commissioners office from the 1920s to the 1980s; notes and memos from his days as the major league schedule maker, letters from fans of his \"So You Think You Know Baseball\" series; articles from the International League; a significant collection of baseball memorabilia, and a major collection of baseball publications and books. The collection was donated in 1998 to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame by his son, David, who is a resident of Toronto. It has been called one of baseball's most eclectic, exciting and diverse collections. The collection is housed in the Harry Simmons Memorial Library, which was opened on April 25, 2019.\nFurther reading.\n\"The below entries are behind a paywall.\""

His Eagles were nationally ranked three times in four years and advanced to the 1977 Junior College World Series, where DeKalb placed second. Morris added two more winning years at DeKalb before moving on to become an assistant coach at Florida State.\nGeorgia Tech.\nAfter a two–year stint with the Seminoles, Morris would accept the head coaching job at Georgia Tech. The Yellow Jackets were on the backside of four straight losing seasons and were 4–23 in their first two seasons in the Atlantic Coast Conference. At Georgia Tech, Morris was the all-time leader in coaching victories, in any of the school's varsity sports, as he had 12 straight winning seasons, nine straight NCAA regional berths, four straight Atlantic Coast Conference titles (1985–88) and a school–record 51 wins in 1987.\nMiami.\nIn his tenure at the University of Miami, no other program has qualified for the College World Series as often as Morris and his Miami Hurricanes.

Morris set an NCAA record for guiding a program to the College World Series in each of his first six years at the University of Miami. Morris returned Miami to Omaha in 2015 and 2016 after a seven-year absence. It was announced in June 2014 that Morris would retire following the 2018 season with longtime assistant Gino DiMare as his successor."

A version for iOS was released in October 2009 but was later removed. It was replaced by the FarSight Studios version in February 2015, also being released on Android as well. FarSight Studios developed versions of the game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, which support the PlayStation Move and Kinect respectively. An updated version developed and published by Alliance Digital Media for the PlayStation 4, and Xbox One was released on November 23, 2015. The Wii U version was released on January 21, 2016.\nGameplay.\nThe game has a free play mode, in which up to four players can play against each other in a match. In the career mode players work their way up from an amateur to professional bowler and a multiplayer mode lets up to four players compete against each other. The PSP version includes wireless multiplayer and additional character customization. The Wii version uses the Wii's tilt sensor to simulate a real swing.\nReception.\nThe reception of \"Brunswick Pro Bowling\" has been mixed. Most critics praised the realistic physics of the game. However, others were annoyed by the fact that the Wii version has flaws with its controls. Players have complained that the on-screen bowler moves slowly and does not go with their own movements, therefore making the release confusing and shots hard. Reviewers did however note there was some considerable depth if the player was to play longer."

        "title": "Pageant of the Masters",
        "text": "The Pageant of the Masters is an annual festival held by the Festival of the Arts in Laguna Beach, California, United States. \nThe event is known for its \"tableaux vivants\" or \"living pictures\" in which classical and contemporary works of art are recreated by real people who are made to look nearly identical to the originals through the clever application of costumes, makeup, headdresses, lighting, props, and backdrops. \nThe first Festival of Arts was produced in 1932, and the first presentation of the Pageant was done in 1933. Since then, the two events have been held each summer, apart from a four-year interruption caused by World War II &amp; in 2020 caused by COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe 89th season of the Pageant of the Masters opened on July 7, 2022 and will run until September 2, 2022. The pageant hosts more than a quarter million people each year.\nHistory.\nIn 1933, at the second Festival of Arts, artist Lolita Perine had an idea for a living work of art. Persuading residents of Laguna Beach to dress in costume, she seated them behind an oversized frame, recreating well-known works of art. \nThe \"Spirit of the Masters Pageant\" was formally started the next year by the Festival's organizers and was put on again in 1934, but in those early days was an amateur operation of low quality.\nIn 1934, local developer Roy Ropp expressed his dissatisfaction with the poor quality of the production in blunt terms; the Festival's board responded to his frank criticism by placing him in charge of the Pageant. He renamed it the \"Pageant of the Masters\" and with the assistance of his wife, Marie, he organized a high-quality and well-received production in the summer of 1935. \nBuilding upon this initial success, the Ropps continued to refine and improve the Pageant through its 1941 production; then the Festival and Pageant were suspended for four years due to World War II. Because of increasing personal friction between the Ropps and the Festival's board, Roy Ropp came back only once after the war to direct the Pageant, in 1950. Ropp died in 1974, but today is still remembered as the \"Father of the Pageant.\"\nThe Pageant was cancelled in 2020 due to COVID-19.\nPageant.\nThe Pageant is held eight weeks each summer and consists of 90 minutes of \"living pictures\" accompanied by a professional narrator, an orchestra, and period songs by professional vocalists. The Pageant is put on by a small paid staff and several hundred volunteers. Production begins in January with auditions and casting of volunteers from all over Southern California; it takes over 60,000 volunteer hours to put on the two-month Pageant in July and August. Today, the costumes and makeup involved are very elaborate and often require large commitments of volunteer time, so to reduce the impact on individual volunteers, the Pageant selects two full casts known as Blue and Green, which then alternate back and forth.\nRecognition.\nIn 2014, \"The New York Times\" summarized the event by stating:\"The pageant is hard to describe, because it is — in a strict sense — unique: There is nothing else in the world like it.\""

        "title": "Formula One Championship Edition",
        "text": "Formula One Championship Edition is a racing video game developed by Studio Liverpool and published by Sony Computer Entertainment exclusively for PlayStation 3.\nBackground.\nThe game follows the basic structure of \"Formula One 06\" for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. The main differences include the updated visuals for the PS3 including a lot more detail, Sixaxis compatibility, real time reflections, car reflections on wet circuits and new wet weather effects. Early in development the safety car was to be included in the game for the first time in an F1 game since \"Formula One 99\" for the PlayStation but was removed before the final release along with the PSP wing mirror integration shown at E3.\nThe game also boasts dynamic weather, and improved AI. The AI system is called \"Live Action Racing\" where one can pressure the opposition, causing them to make little mistakes such as running wide on corners, causing them to crash into other cars or spin off the road of their own accord. The AI will then try to seek opportunities to pass the player in a realistic manner.\nThe game is based on the early 2006 Formula One World Championship. Hence, Yuji Ide drives for Super Aguri when in reality he lost his super licence just 4 races into the '06 Formula One World Championship, and Franck Montagny, then later Sakon Yamamoto took his seat. Other minor changes throughout the real 2006 Formula One World Championship are also not represented, therefore Pedro de la Rosa, Robert Kubica. Robert Doornbos, Franck Montagny and Sakon Yamamoto are not featured. Also, the Midland team are not re-branded as Spyker in later Grands Prix in the game.\nIn the career mode, players begin by running tests for one of three teams (Toro Rosso, Super Aguri or Midland F1) at either the Silverstone, Magny Cours or Catalunya circuits. The tests given vary between the teams. When the player successfully completes the tests, they are given the role of test driver or race driver, depending on how well the player performed in the test. After performing well as a test driver, the player will become the second driver of the team. From there the player can compete in race weekends through many different roles. As a test driver the player will try out different car settings in practice, and as a driver the player will have track position targets to meet to keep the seat. The player's performances are subject to review at several points during the season.\nThe initial release did not include force feedback support, which is considered by many to be an important feature for simulation racing games used with driving wheel controllers. A subsequent update in early 2008 added force feedback. The game also lacks support for 1080i or 1080p output resolutions. Per the calendar, the Belgian Grand Prix is not included.\nGameplay.\n\"Formula One Championship Edition\" follows the 2006 Formula One World Championship, with 18 tracks, 11 teams and 22 drivers. Driver changes that happened during the real 2006 Formula One World Championship are also not included, such as Juan Pablo Montoya leaving McLaren after the United States Grand Prix and replaced by Pedro de la Rosa and Jacques Villeneuve leaving BMW Sauber after the German Grand Prix and replaced by Robert Kubica.\nRelease.\n\"Formula One Championship Edition\" was released in North America on February 27, 2007. It was the first Formula One game to be released there since 2003, when Atari released \"Grand Prix Challenge\" exclusively for PlayStation 2 and EA Sports released \"F1 Challenge '99-'02\" for the PC, and \"F1 Career Challenge\" for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube. It was a launch title for the European and Australasian release of the PlayStation 3.\n\"Formula One Championship Edition\" was the final release in Sony's series of F1 games which had been running for over a decade, with the announcement that Codemasters had secured exclusive rights to the sport following shortly after the game's release. As this game was effectively an update of the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable game \"Formula One 06\", there was to be no 2007 version of the game - the first time the series had skipped a season since 1996.\nThis was the most recent F1 game given the three-season gap before Sumo Digital's \"F1 2009\" (published by Codemasters) game came out on PSP and Nintendo Wii. In September 2010, Codemasters released \"F1 2010\" with all the official teams and tracks, available on PS3, Xbox 360 and PC.\nReception.\nThe game received \"average\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of 30 out of 40.\n411Mania gave it an eight out of ten, praising the gameplay, graphics, customization and called it a \"high-octane fun\". \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" gave it three stars out of five, and was positive to the graphics and car handling. The \"Detroit Free Press\" was more negative to the game and gave it two stars out of four, writing: \"How well can you follow a big green line? The game shows you the shortest distance around the track -- a green line to follow. The line turns briefly red when you come to a turn, but don't ease up on the throttle, because the game slows your vehicle down for you. How boring is that?\""

Ohio also appeared in the College Basketball Invitational in 2008, 2016, and 2022 and the CollegeInsider.com Tournament in 2011 and 2014. The program was ranked 86th in \"Street &amp; Smith's 100 Greatest Basketball Programs of All Time\", published in 2005.\nHistory.\nThe first intercollegiate men's basketball game involving an Ohio University team was played in Athens in 1907 against the Parkersburg YMCA. Under the direction of coach James Jones, the Bobcats won the game by a score of 46–9 and continued their victories with a 5-game winning streak to start the season. The 'Cats would go on to lose 4 games that season and earn a 7–4 record.\nCoach Jones would only be at Ohio for two more seasons, leading the team to records of 1–1 in the 1908–09 campaign and 2–5 during the 1909–10 season. Over the next three seasons, the basketball program was in a state of flux, with a new coach taking over the reins every year. Ohio joined the Ohio Athletic Conference in 1911, and started out poorly under coach Arthur Hinaman with a 2–9 record.\nA bit of stability arrived to Athens with the hiring of coach Mark Banks in 1913. Banks would lead the program to a 3–10 season in his first year, but the 'Cats surged to 11–4 in Bank's second year at the helm. That 1914–1915 squad beat the Cincinnati Bearcats and the Miami Redskins twice, while also impressively defeating Wooster by a score of 51–20. Banks teams would fall off over the next several seasons, with the low point being a 2–14 mark in the 1916–1917 campaign. Banks would coach only one more year, with the Bobcats posting a 4–8 record in the 1918–1919 season.\nBank's successor was Frank Gullum, who in his two years at the helm was 5–4 and 5–6, respectively. Gullum was succeeded by Russell Finsterwald, who led the team to an outstanding 15–2 season in his first year at the helm. That 1920–1921 team defeated the Miami Redskins and Cincinnati Bearcats each twice, and also earned Ohio's first Ohio Athletic Association title. Finsterwald's 1921–1922 squad was equally impressive, posting a 19–4 mark with two wins against the Bowling Green Falcons. Though Finsterwald would only last these two seasons, his work cannot be underestimated in steering the 'Cats towards a legacy of success.\n1922–1949: The Grover-Trautwein era.\nButch Grover took the reins of the Ohio program in 1922, and led the team to a newfound level of success. His inaugural 1922–1923 season was marked by an 11–8 record, and wins over teams such as the Cincinnati Bearcats and the Marietta Pioneers. In 1923-24, the Bobcats marked their move into the brand new Men's Gymnasium with a 16–5 record and a near miss of an Ohio Athletic Conference title. Several winning seasons later, the Bobcats moved into the Buckeye Athletic Association in 1926 and started off with an 8–13 mark in the 1926–1927 season. Ohio won its first Buckeye Athletic Association title during the 1930–31 season with a 12–4 mark. Just two seasons later in 1933–1934, the Bobcats won another Buckeye Athletic Association championship with a 16–4 record and two wins over the archrival Miami Redskins. The 1936–1937 season marked Grover's third and final Buckeye Athletic Association championship. The Bobcats were 18–3 that year, and earned wins over programs such as Xavier and Dayton.\nWilliam J. \"Dutch\" Trautwein took over the Bobcat basketball program in 1938. He led the team to 12–8 and 19–6 records in his first and second seasons. In the 1940–41 season, the team earned a record of 18–4, and was selected for the National Invitation Tournament after a season which included wins over Xavier, Akron, Toledo, Cincinnati, and archrival Miami. With the play of Frank Baumholtz, the Bobcats finished as runners-up in the tournament to perennial power Long Island University. Baumholtz, known as the \"Midvale Marvel\", earned tournament MVP honors and All-American status for his NIT performance. Following his Ohio career, he became one of a few to play two professional sports – basketball with the Cleveland Rebels in 1946–47 and baseball with the Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, and Philadelphia Phillies over a 10-year career.\nAfter several more winning seasons under Trautwein, the Bobcats undertook a new challenge in 1946 when they joined the new Mid-American Conference. The 'Cats were 13–10 in their first year in the MAC, and followed that up with a 10–10 mark in the 1947–1948 season. The 1948–1949 season was Trautwein's last, with the team compiling a 6–16 record.\n1949–1974: Jim Snyder.\nOhio alumnus Jim Snyder took over for Trautwein in 1949. Ohio's winningest coach, dubbed \"Gentleman Jim\", guided the Bobcats for a quarter century. With star players like Jim Betts, Bunk Adams, Jerry Jackson, Don Hilt, Gerald McKee and \"Sports Illustrated\" cover boy Walter Luckett, Snyder won a total of seven MAC titles. His teams made seven NCAA appearances and finished with a winning record 21 times in 25 years.\nSnyder's first season was rather lackluster, with the 'Cats posting a 6–14 record. He followed that up with a slight improvement in the 1950–1951 season and a 13–11 mark. The 1954–1955 season was a breakout year for Ohio, and the team earned a 16–5 record and key wins over Morehead State and Miami University. In 1960, Ohio won its first championship under Snyder, with the team taking the MAC by way of a 10–2 league record (17–8 overall). That squad defeated the likes of the Toledo Rockets, Bowling Green Falcons, and Miami Redskins en route to a 74–66 win over in the first round of the NCAA tournament.\nThe 1959–1960 championship team was quickly followed up by another title in the very next year. The 1960–1961 team celebrated its move into the brand new Grover Center with a stunning 10–2 league record (17–7 overall), including a first-place finish at the Canton Intercollegiate Tournament. A few years later, the 1963–1964 team made its mark as perhaps the best in Ohio history. That team won the MAC title with a 10–2 league mark, and followed it up with NCAA tournament wins over the Louisville Cardinals and the No. 4 Kentucky Wildcats. Snyder's 'Cats ultimately lost to the No. 2 Michigan Wolverines in the \"Elite Eight\".\nThough the 1963–1964 team produced a record that was hard to top, the 1964–1965 edition did its best to compete with the previous year's squad. They posted an 11–1 MAC record and a 19–7 overall mark, though fell to Dayton in the first round of the NCAA tournament. Snyder's teams would go through a slight drought until the 1968–1969 season, when they open up the Convocation Center with a win over the Indiana Hoosiers and subsequent postseason NIT appearance and a 17–9 record. The very next season, Ohio scored wins over No. 16 Ohio State and No. 13 Purdue and achieved a midseason #5 national ranking while marching their way to another MAC championship before losing in the NCAA tournament to Notre Dame.\nThe Bobcats won another MAC title under Snyder in the 1971–1972 season. Though the 'Cats were just 15–11 that year, they were 7–3 in the MAC with wins over the No. 12 Indiana Hoosiers and the No. 4 Ohio State Buckeyes. Snyder's Bobcats won a final MAC title in the 1973–1974 season, with a 16–11 record and wins over the and the Ohio State Buckeyes.\n1974–1989.\nJim Snyder was immediately succeeded by his assistant Dale Bandy, who struggled to a 69–89 record over his six-year tenure at Ohio. Bandy was replaced by Danny Nee in 1980, with the Bobcats beginning a road back to prominence. His teams – led by the likes of John Devereaux, Robert Tatum, Paul Baron, John Rhodes, Eddie Hicks and Vic Alexander –tallied four consecutive 20-win seasons from 1983 to 1986. The 1982-83 team won the MAC Tournament title with a subsequent win in the NCAA tournament. In 1985 the Bobcats won both the MAC regular season and tournament but lost to Kansas in the NCAA tournament. The 1986 team finished with an NIT matchup in the Convo versus the Ohio State Buckeyes.\nNee left in 1986 to coach the Nebraska Cornhuskers, with Billy Hahn taking over the reins. His teams were led by future NBA players Paul \"Snoopy\" Graham and Dave Jamerson, two of Ohio's three 2,000-point scorers. Jamerson's 31.2 points per-game average in 1989–90 included a Convo-record 60-point win over the University of Charleston.\n1989–2001: Larry Hunter.\nDespite offensive stars, Hahn's teams struggled on the court. Hahn was replaced in 1989 by Larry Hunter, an Ohio alum who would lead the Bobcats throughout the 1990s. Forward Gary Trent joined Graham and Jamerson atop the 2,000-point plateau, and was the MAC's only three-time Player of the Year. Trent teamed with three-point marksman Geno Ford to guide Larry Hunter's Bobcats to a MAC Championship in the 1993–1994 season. Ohio captured the conference tournament that season with an 89–66 victory over archrival Miami in the finals on ESPN.\nHunter, who played for Snyder, saw Ohio defeat Ohio State in the Preseason NIT to open the following season. Wins over 14th-ranked Virginia, George Washington and New Mexico State earned the Bobcats a Preseason NIT title and an accompanying national ranking. That team would go on to post a 24–10 (13–5 MAC) record, en route to an appearance in the post-season NIT and a win over George Washington University in the first round.\nThe Bobcats would struggle in the next few years under Hunter, with the low point being a 5–21 season in the 1997–1998 campaign. Though Hunter's teams would rebound to post 18, 20, and 19 wins over the next three seasons, he was relieved of his duties in 2001 due to a lack of success in the postseason. His successor would be Tim O'Shea.\n2001–2008: Tim O'Shea.\nA new era in Ohio basketball began in 2001 when Boston College assistant Tim O'Shea became the Bobcats' 15th head coach. His teams featured Patrick Flomo, Brandon Hunter and Steve Esterkamp and saw the creation The Convo's new student section, the O Zone. Hunter was drafted by the Boston Celtics in the second round of the 2003 draft. Esterkamp continues to play professionally overseas as well.\nIn the 2004–2005 season Ohio went 13–1 in The Convo and won 13 of their final 17 games. The team defeated Marshall, Kent State, and Miami in the preliminary rounds of the MAC tournament before scoring an 80–79 overtime victory over Buffalo in the championship to earn an NCAA tournament berth. Despite a second-half comeback against the Southeastern Conference champion Florida, the Bobcats' season ended in the first round.\nThe 2005–2006 'Cats proved successful as well, posting a 19–11 record with wins over teams such as Rhode Island and Samford, and a close loss to Kentucky. The 2006–2007 team also posted 19 wins, with a final record of 19–13. A 20 win campaign was had in the 2007–2008 season, including notable non-conference wins over Maryland, St. John's, George Mason, and Bucknell. The team was extended an invite to the College Basketball Invitational, where the Bobcats advanced to the second round.\nOn June 23, 2008, O'Shea announced he was leaving the Bobcats team to become head coach at Bryant University.\n2008–2012: John Groce.\nOn June 27, 2008, former Ohio State associate head coach John Groce was named the 16th head coach in Bobcats history. Groce brought 14 years of assistant coaching experience to Athens, along with a pair of outright Big Ten Conference regular-season titles, two NCAA tournament appearances, a berth in the 2007 NCAA National Championship game and the 2008 NIT title.\nThe Bobcats finished the 2009–2010 regular season with a 17–14 overall record and a 7–9 record in MAC play, earning them the ninth seed in their conference tournament. They won four straight games in the conference tournament to claim the MAC's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. Placed into the Midwest region as a 14 seed, Ohio upset 3rd-seeded and 12th ranked Georgetown 97–83. The Bobcats took a 12-point lead into halftime and the Hoyas never got closer than a 7-point deficit the rest of the way.\nAfter a mildly disappointing 2010–11 season, resulting in a 19–16 record and a 2011 CIT Quarterfinal berth, the Bobcats came back in 2011–12, with a 2012 MAC tournament championship. The Bobcats received a No. 13 seed in the Midwest Region of the 2012 NCAA tournament. Like 2010, Ohio pulled off a first round upset, defeating 4th seeded and 13th ranked Michigan 65–60, and followed by a 62–56 victory over 12th seeded South Florida to advance to their first Sweet Sixteen since 1964. The Bobcats run ended in the Sweet Sixteen, as they fell in overtime to fourth ranked and top seeded North Carolina by a score of 73–65.\nAs a result of the teams' success, John Groce was offered and accepted the head coaching position at the University of Illinois on March 28, 2012.\n2012–2014: Jim Christian.\nOn April 3, 2012, Ohio hired former TCU and Kent State coach Jim Christian to replace John Groce. Christian had considerable success in the MAC at the helm of Kent State, eclipsing the 20 win plateau in each of his six seasons.\nIn Christian's first season with the Bobcats, they finished with a 24–10 overall record and 14–2 in the MAC. Tied for first in the MAC East, the Bobcats were the 2nd seed in the MAC tournament falling to Akron in the championship 65–46. Akron was the only MAC opponent the Bobcats had failed to defeat all season. The Bobcats earned a spot in the 2013 National Invitation Tournament but came up short with a 61–57 loss to Denver in the first round.\nDuring the 2013–14 season, Christian led the Bobcats to a 25–12 record making the senior class the winningest class in school history with 97 total wins. Ohio failed to reach the NCAA Tournament, losing to Akron once again in the MAC Tournament. The team received an invitation to participate in the 2014 CIT and reached the quarterfinals losing to VMI 90–92.\nOn April 3, 2014, Christian left Ohio and accepted an offer to become the head coach for the Boston College Eagles.\n2014–2019: Saul Phillips.\nOhio hired Saul Phillips to replace Christian as the head coach for the Bobcats on April 6, 2014. Phillips had tremendous success coaching for NDSU the previous 7 years, including a second round NCAA tournament win in 2014 and two Summit League championships in 2009 and 2014. His first season at Ohio was a disappointment as the 2014–15 Bobcats finished with a 10–20 overall record and only 5 wins in the MAC to put them last place in their division.\nThe 2015–16 Bobcats improved to a 23–12 overall record and 11–7 MAC Conference record giving them the #2 seed in the 2016 MAC tournament. Junior Antonio Campbell was named the 2016 MAC Player of the Year after averaging a double-double throughout the 2015–16 season, making him the ninth Ohio Bobcat to receive the award. The Bobcats lost to Buffalo in the semifinal game of the MAC Tournament 74–88. The 2015–16 team received and accepted an invitation to the 2016 College Basketball Invitational and reached the semifinals but lost to Morehead State.\nPhillips was told he would not return next season on March 13, 2019.\n2019–present: Jeff Boals.\nOhio hired alumnus Jeff Boals to replace Phillips as the head coach for the Bobcats on March 17, 2019. Boals (pronounced BOWLS) spent the prior three seasons as the head coach at Stony Brook going 55–41 overall and 31–17 in America East play. The Bobcats went 17-15 in Boals first season with Ohio. Following the 2019-2020 season, the MAC tournament was cancelled due to the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The next season Boals lead his 2020-21 team to a 17-8 record including 3 wins in the MAC tournament. They received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament as the No. 13 seed in the West region. There they upset No. 4-seeded Virginia in the First Round before falling to No. 5-seeded Creighton in the Second Round. The 2021-22 team opened the season 22–4 but struggled down the stretch to finish 25–10 His 2022-23 team had a lot of roster turnover and slipped to 19–14. His 2023-24 team finished 20–13.\nSeasonal Results.\nAs of 3/15/2024\nSource:\nPostseason results.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Bobcats have appeared in 14 NCAA Tournaments.

        "title": "Tommy James (American football)",
        "text": "Thomas Laverne James, Jr. (September 16, 1923 – February 7, 2007) was an American football defensive back and punter who played for Ohio State University and the Cleveland Browns in the 1940s and 1950s. He was born in Canton, Ohio and attended Massillon Washington High School, where he played as a back on the football team under head coach Paul Brown. James was a key part of a Massillon team that went undefeated in 1940. After graduating, he followed Brown to Ohio State and played there as a halfback. Ohio State won its first national championship in 1942 when James was on the team.\nAfter a three-year stint in the U.S. Army during World War II, James returned to play a final season at Ohio State in 1946. He then signed with the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL), where he stayed for a year before rejoining Brown, who had become head coach of the Cleveland Browns in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). James spent eight seasons in Cleveland, playing as a defensive halfback on five championship teams, including two in the AAFC in the late 1940s and three in the NFL in the 1950s. He left football after playing briefly for the Baltimore Colts in 1956. Later in life, he worked as a salesman at a trucking company. He died in 2007.\nHigh school and college.\nJames grew up in Genoa, a small community in between Canton, Ohio and Massillon, Ohio. The oldest of five children, one of his younger brothers included Don James, a Hall of Fame coach for Kent State and the University of Washington. He attended grammar school there through the eighth grade, but the town did not have a high school and students could choose to attend either Massillon Washington High School or the rival Canton McKinley High School. James at first decided to attend Canton, but Bud Houghton, an assistant coach of Massillon's football team, saw him playing in an informal scrimmage on a street corner and convinced him to come to Massillon. He played football there for three years under head coach Paul Brown. Playing as a back, James was part of a Massillon team that went undefeated in 1940. He scored a touchdown in a 28–0 victory over Toledo's Waite High School, the biggest game of the year; Massillon came into the matchup having won 30 games in a row, while Waite had won 18 straight.\nJames attended Ohio State University starting in 1941, the same year Brown was hired as the school's head football coach. He played on the freshman team in his first year, moving to the varsity team in 1942. Ohio State finished the season with a 9–1 win–loss record and won its first-ever college football national championship. James, who played as a halfback, was injured in a late-season game against the University of Illinois. This caused him to miss Ohio State's annual game against arch-rival Michigan, but he returned for the final game of the season against Iowa Pre-Flight, a military squad. James ran for a 54-yard touchdown on that game's first play and later added a punt return for a touchdown as Ohio State won 41–12.\nJames enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1943 and served for three years during World War II. He returned to Ohio State in 1946 and played on the varsity team again. The Buckeyes finished with a 4–3–2 record under coach Paul Bixler.\nProfessional career.\nJames signed with the National Football League's (NFL) Detroit Lions in 1947. He was still eligible to play in college at the time, but wartime rules allowed him to skip to the professional ranks and play for the Lions, who had selected him in the 1947 NFL Draft. James broke his arm in the second game of the season, and he sat on the sidelines for the rest of the year. Detroit did not renew his contract, and the Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), a team coached by Paul Brown, picked him up. He started at right defensive halfback in 1948 opposite Tommy Colella and intercepted four passes as the Browns went 15–0 and won the All-America Football Conference championship. Brown was pleasantly surprised by his abilities on defense. \"Tommy always was a pretty good man on defense at Massillon and Ohio State\", he said in 1948. \"But his play this year has even surprised those of us who knew him in high school and college. I think we're definitely improved at defensive right half over last year.\"\nJames continued to be a key defensive player for the Browns in 1949, when the team won another AAFC championship behind a staunch defense and an offense led by quarterback Otto Graham and fullback Marion Motley. The AAFC dissolved after the season, however, and the Browns moved to the NFL. Cleveland's first year in the NFL was the best of James's career: he intercepted nine passes, setting a club record that stood until 1978. The team finished the season with a 10–2 record and beat the Los Angeles Rams to win the NFL championship. James made an interception in the game. He also held the ball for placekicker Lou Groza on the game-winning field goal with under a minute to play.\nCleveland reached the championship in each of the ensuing three years, but lost each time, once to the Rams and twice to the Detroit Lions. James intercepted five passes and recovered two fumbles in 1953 and was selected for the Pro Bowl, the NFL's annual all-star game. The Browns went on to win the NFL championship again in 1954 and 1955. James was moved from defensive halfback to safety in 1955 later in his career and was hampered by injuries.\nBrown released the 33-year-old James on waivers before the 1956 season, which allowed other teams to pick up his contract. Brown said it was \"one of the toughest things I've had to do in football\" because of the effort James put out. James had worked in the offseason as a sporting goods salesman and had an offer to join a trucking firm, but said he wanted to continue his football career for one more year. He was picked up by the Baltimore Colts but left the team in October after injuring his shoulder. He ended his NFL career with 34 interceptions, all with the Browns, tying him for eighth place in team history.\nLater life and death.\nAfter his football career, James worked in the trucking business as a salesman, retiring at age 69. He had three sons, Tom, who resides in Michigan, Robert, who also went into the trucking business, and Mike who became the head track coach at Massillon Washington. James died in 2007 of congestive heart failure."

        "text": "William Jeremiah Murray (April 13, 1864 — March 25, 1937) was one of the most successful managers in American minor league baseball during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He also spent three seasons (1907–09) in Major League Baseball as manager of the Philadelphia Phillies of the National League.\nBiography.\nA native of Peabody, Massachusetts, Murray entered professional baseball in 1884 as an outfielder for the nearby Salem club in the Massachusetts State Association. He began his minor league managing career at age 25 with the Quincy, Illinois, \"Ravens\" of the Central Interstate League in 1889. After winning back-to-back pennants at Quincy and Joliet of the Illinois–Iowa League in 1891–92, Murray spent nine seasons (1894–1902) as skipper of the Providence Grays of the top-level Eastern League (a forerunner of today's International League). He then spent four winning seasons as manager of the Jersey City Skeeters of the Eastern circuit, taking one league pennant. His record as a minor league manager was 1,234 victories and 876 defeats over 18 seasons, a winning percentage of .585, one of the highest among longtime minor league managers.\nMurray then took the helm of the Phillies in 1907, inheriting a fourth-place team that had won only 71 games during . Murray promptly led the Phils to 83 victories and a third-place finish in 1907, but his club finished games in arrears of the league champion Chicago Cubs. His club also won 83 games, but fell to fourth, 16 games behind Chicago. When the 1909 Phillies tumbled even further, to 74 wins and a fifth-place finish, games behind the Pittsburgh Pirates, Murray was replaced as manager by Red Dooin. His career record as a major-league manager was 240–214 (.529).\nHe died in Youngstown, Ohio, at the age of 72, and is interred in St. Mary's Cemetery, Salem, Massachusetts."

        "title": "British baseball",
        "text": "British baseball, also known colloquially in Wales as Welsh baseball (), is a bat-and-ball game played in Wales, England, and to a lesser extent in Ireland and Scotland. The game emerged as a distinct sport in Merseyside, Gloucester and South Wales at the end of the 19th Century, drawing on the much older game of rounders. Teams in all locations played under the codified rules created by the National Rounders Association (later renamed as the (English Baseball Association), with the game in Wales locally organised first by the South Wales Baseball Association, (still playing under English Baseball Association rules), who in turn were replaced by the Welsh Baseball Union. The Irish Baseball Union were formed in 1933. Both the English Baseball Association and Welsh Baseball Union are members of the International Baseball Board.\nHistory.\nIn the tradition of bat-and-ball games, British baseball has roots going back centuries, and there are references to \"baseball\" from the beginning of the eighteenth century, and \"rounders\" from 1828. Bat-and-ball games in Britain have a long history and a ball and bat game possibly ancestral to rounders and British baseball was attested as early as 1344. A game called \"baseball\" was attested in 1700 when a vicar in Maidstone decried its playing on a Sunday, and referenced in 1744 in the children's book \"A Little Pretty Pocket-Book\" where it was called Base-Ball. Jane Austen also included a passing reference to the game in \"Northanger Abbey\".\nEstablishment of codified rules.\nThe National Rounders Association were based in Merseyside, England, where in April 1886 they were one of a number of locally based sporting institutions with elected representation onto the directorate of the Liverpool Athletic Grounds Company Ltd. Calls were made to follow the success of other working class sports such as football, on Merseyside, and rugby in Wales to adopt a distinct set of rules and bureaucracy. The National Rounders Association were one of a number of national organisations supported by the National Physical Recreation society, created in 1886 with Herbert Gladstone as President, \"to promote physical recreation amongst the working classes\".\nThe National Rounders Association duly created a new game, drawing on the much older game of rounders but with new rules that they hoped would appeal to adults. With plans to spread this new game across the entire United Kingdom, Gloucester adopted the sport in 1887, with the Gloucester Rounders Association formed in 1888. In a June 1888 edition of the South Wales Daily News, the now codified rules of this new sport were discussed and it was noted that \"the National Rounders Association is the authority\". It was also noted that the National Physical Recreation society had supplied a copy of the rules of this new game to the author and \"the present mode of playing the game is a great improvement on the old style\". In South Wales the game fully took hold in 1889, four clubs were created in South Wales who in 1890 then formed the South Wales Rounders Association. The rules of the new game, created by the National Rounders Association were as follows. \"The bases are four, and the runs are made to the right. Eleven is the correct number of players, as at cricket, the bowler, man behind batsmen, longstop, one at each of the bases and cover bases. A regulation bat, not to exceed 30 inches in length or 3 1/2 inches in breadth, is used instead of the 'timmy'. Runs are scored individually to the striker, and collectively to the side; a run for each base that the striker succeeds in reaching without stopping. The ball must be delivered over the striking base above the knee and below the head to be a 'good ball'; two bad balls count one point to the opposite side.\nThe threat of the American code of baseball in Britain reached a peak between 1889 and 1890, when a national league for that code was formed, the first fully professional baseball league in Britain. The National League of Baseball of Great Britain was created at a meeting at the Criterion, London, alongside the establishment a new baseball association, the new association quickly moved to establish a headquarters at 38 Holborn Viaduct, London. Curiously the National Rounders Association were represented at the meeting. This was the third attempt by American backers to establish their influence over bat and ball games in Britain, in the 1870s, baseball teams from the United States, including the Boston Red Stockings and Philadelphia Athletics, toured the United Kingdom but with limited success. In 1889 the wealthy Albert Goodwill Spalding used his position as a former star player of the American code, and as a leading sporting goods supplier, to arrange another tour of the United Kingdom by American baseball stars including the Chicago White Stockings.\nIn 1892, in “finding there was so much prejudice against the name” the National Rounders Association and the South Wales Rounders Association dropped ‘rounders’ and replaced this with ‘baseball’. This resulted in the governing body, the National Rounders Association, being known as the English Baseball Association and the South Wales Rounders Association becoming the South Wales Baseball Association, who at their annual meeting in Newport, in 1893, \"decided to continue to play under English rules\". By the end of the 1892 season, baseball teams from Liverpool and Lancashire were invited to play matches at Cardiff Arms Park with the express purpose of popularising \"the improved version of the old-fashioned game of rounders\". In May 1892, it was reported that the Gloucestershire Rounders Association had become the Gloucester English Baseball Association, with leagues already under way. By June 1892 baseball in Gloucestershire was in full swing, but ultimately this was a short lived enterprise.\nIn June 1892 Newton Crane, the President of the National Baseball Association (the body responsible for the overseeing of the American rules of baseball in Great Britain) wrote an open letter in the Liverpool Mercury, stating that Derby Baseball Club had accepted the challenge of the Chief Executive Officer of the National Rounders Association (by now renamed as the English Baseball Association), that a team of the best British baseball players in the country could defeat a team of the best ‘American rules’ baseball players in Britain. The matches would “be played according to the genuine or regular baseball rules”, with a match each in Liverpool and Derby. By 1894 the Liverpool and District Baseball League was established and the game was flourishing on Merseyside and parts of Lancashire and South Wales. In April 1899, at the annual meeting of the English Baseball Association in Liverpool, it was resolved that the rules of the game would be changed, to speed up play and tackle the “waiting tactics adopted by batsmen”. The change would see batters face two “good balls” instead of three, and that on the third “good ball” the batter would get an “extra” ball.\nFirst internationals and first women's games.\nIn 1905 the South Wales Baseball Association had just fifteen member clubs, by 1921 the game had become ubiquitous in its heartland cities, with the newly renamed Welsh Baseball Union comprising sixty clubs, all within the Cardiff and Newport areas. As the number of amateur clubs expanded in Cardiff, Newport and Merseyside a Wales-England fixture was proposed to promote the sport further. The inaugural international match was held on 3 August 1908 at the Harlequins Ground in Roath, Cardiff (St Peter's RFC). Wales won the match 122–118 with batsmen and captain Lew Lewis hitting a number of balls 'over the house tops'.\nThe game in Cardiff had already become a popular summer pursuit among the city's rugby players and the match saw three Cardiff RFC players take the field, including Viv Huzzey, who also represented Wales in rugby union and rugby league. The next international was held in 1914 at Goodison Park, Liverpool. The English won the match in front of 4,000 spectators, but annual internationals would not start until after the war. During World War I the English Baseball Association were keen on keeping baseball ticking over in the Liverpool region, despite a lack of experienced players. In February 1916 the annual meeting was held, with the primary topic of discussion being efforts to utilise munitions workers and others to supplement existing teams, and the English Baseball Association organised games to raise funds for the war effort.\nIn August 1918 the English Baseball Association organised an international fixture, whereby England took on Canada at the Police Athletic Ground in the Fairfield area of Liverpool. This game was advertised to have been ‘American baseball’. The game continued to gain popularity during the interwar period and was an \"integral part of local culture\" in Cardiff and Newport. Schoolboy leagues were established, and Cardiff saw the first schoolgirls league. In July 1921 there were efforts for the establishment of a National Baseball Council, where members of the English Baseball Association and South Wales Baseball Association met to discuss the formation of the new governing body. In March 1922 the first annual meeting of the newly formed Welsh Baseball Union was held at Grange YMCA, succeeding the South Wales Baseball Association. The new body quickly made a visit to Liverpool and noted that “the closer link formed between the English and Welsh baseball authorities would materially help to attain the standard of a national pastime”. Welsh baseball was by now notable for its female participation, which had begun during the First World War among the young women working in factories. A women's league was set up in Cardiff in 1922 and in 1926 the first women's international match took place between Wales and England.\nBy September 1922 the need for better officiating of games was recognised and the Umpire’s Association was formed. \nIn an effort to spread the native baseball rules exhibition games were organised by the English Baseball Association, in London, in 1924. Liverpool and Scotland international Donald McKinlay was one of the baseball players on show. The crowd at the 1924 Cardiff Arms Park men's international reached 10,000 spectators for the first time and the 1925 fixture at the Police Athletic Ground, Liverpool, saw a crowd of 12,000.\nIn September 1925 it was reported in the Liverpool Echo that a “revolutionary change in bowling” was being mulled over by the English Baseball Association. The new proposed rule would be “that when the bowler has sent up the third bad ball before he has sent up the second good ball, the batter shall be allowed to go to the first base, and the batting side shall have a bye recorded in their favour. If the first base, at the time, is occupied by another batter, that batter should go to second base. If two or three bases are occupied by batters at the time, each batter shall proceed to his next base, the batter at third base reaching home; but no batter at second or third base shall go to his next base except to make way for the batter occupying the next previous base.”\nThe Athletic News reported, in June 1927, that a British Cup was being considered, between the finalists of the English Baseball Association and Welsh Baseball Union championships. By 1927 the English Baseball Association had three divisions, with a total of 23 clubs across Merseyside and attendances were outstripping those at greyhound racing stadiums. A number of international rugby, football and cricket players were taking up the game and Everton and Liverpool football clubs were heavily involved. Finally, in May 1929, the rules of the English Baseball Association were copyrighted. The growth of the international fixture had brought increased scrutiny on the game's arbitration and rules, as such the English Baseball Association and the Welsh Baseball Union formed the International Baseball Board to oversee the internationals in 1927. Finally, in May 1929, the rules of the English Baseball Association were copyrighted, emphasising their role in the birth of the codified sport and their governorship of the rules that controlled the game.\nDepression, the Second World War and the second peak of the American game.\nThe Great Depression saw further increases in the number of clubs and players, and local club matches would attract thousands of spectators as community sports provided a welcome distraction during a turbulent period. The Cardiff &amp; District League boasted 37 teams by 1929, 19 of which were based in the working class areas of Splott and Grangetown alone. In the inter-war years British baseball had a short lived foothold in on the island of Ireland, leading to the formation of an Irish Baseball Union, who organised for a team to travel to Liverpool to play in their first ever international game against England, in June 1933. The team included players from St. Mary's, St. Oswald's, British and Irish, Hibernians, Independent and Connaught ball clubs. England won by an innings and 42 runs. In October 1934 the English Baseball Association signed an agreement to travel to Edinburgh in 1935, to begin the process of introducing the game into Scotland, though a number of well known Scottish players such as Billy Lamont, Charlie Moore and Donald MacKinlay were already playing in leagues in Liverpool. In the first game, the Scottish defeated the English at Edinburgh by 24 runs to 3, with over 5,000 in attendance. The return game at Bootle attracted a crowd of over 3,000 spectators, to see Scotland triumph again, 4 runs to 0. These two games were played to the American code.\nThe 1930s saw American baseball's popularity peak again in Britain with professional teams sharing grounds with soccer clubs (10,000 spectators attending the biggest games), and saw the British team winning the inaugural Baseball World Cup in 1938. The American game was supported by more touring teams from America and Japan; this afforded the Welsh teams a chance to test themselves against the more widely appreciated (and often professional) American teams. In one such game on August 27, 1938, the Penylan club side beat the \"London Americans\" at Cardiff Arms Park. The contest saw one innings under \"Welsh\" rules, and three innings under U.S. rules.\nThe decade also saw further moves to establish American baseball on Merseyside. The moves met with a mixed reception among players of the British game with some apprehensive the move would end the older game in England. Although British baseball would survive, the American league had a detrimental effect throughout the decade, with players, crowds and backers leaving the sport for a professional career in a game gaining support throughout England. An American league was also established in Cardiff in 1939, but the professional American game ended with the outbreak of war, and would never regain such widespread popularity.\nPost-war zenith.\nAlthough internationals ceased during wartime, sides would stage successful games with the crews of American warships using either American or Welsh rules. Home victories emboldened the local's belief in the ability of the Welsh players. This pride and belief was evident when the annual internationals resumed in 1948 at Cardiff's Castle Grounds, with a record 16,000 spectators in attendance and Welsh legend Ted Peterson leading Wales to victory. This increasing popularity of the game saw it develop a distinct community appeal. In addition to the now established clubs, churches, stores, factories, and bars would form teams, and the game became the heart of social activities for many, especially in Cardiff. The sport was also enjoying popularity In England, with a number of Exhibition games played in London and teams established in Bristol and Coventry.\nThe 1950s and 1960s saw more dominance for the Welsh international team. Welsh legend Paddy Hennessey made his international debut in the 1957 win over England. He would go on to be widely recognised as a great of the game, and the fastest bowler of the era. The 1964 International saw Hennessey (as captain) demolish his rivals' batting line up for a record six runs in 30 balls and just nine minutes in front of a crowd of 6,000 at the Maindy Stadium. This record is notable as it would not be surpassed for 50 years, when Wales international Matthew Hopkins managed the same feat for the loss of just one run in the 2014 fixture at Whiteheads Ground, Newport. The record remains one of the longest standing in global sports.\nDecline in popularity and the modern era.\nThe sport gained a new audience in Wales as live coverage of the international fixture and some club matches became a feature of Welsh television in the 1970s and 1980s, but the last decades of the century were generally characterised by a continued decline in attendances and participation. In 1989 reserves of the long used worsted made Webber ball were exhausted, following the manufacturer Jaques of London, ceasing production. Various American made balls were tired but found to be heavier and slightly larger than the traditional ball. The international fixture continued to draw interest with BBC Cymru Wales broadcast highlights of the international game until the 1990s; by then the match was seen as a curiosity with radio and TV features the limit of its national exposure. The prospect of watching Wales' star rugby players play the game also ended in 1995 with the introduction of professional contracts, ceasing their unsanctioned participation in other sports.\nBy 2006 participation levels in England had slumped considerably to a point where only four clubs remained active: All Saints, Anfield, Breckside and Townsend. The centenary international was held in Cardiff on 19 July 2008, with Wales winning their tenth victory in a row by an innings and 44. As well as the full international, similar internationals are held for 'B' teams and for junior grades. The match was the 83rd international played between the two nations, and was Wales' 61st victory; England had won 20 and two games were declared draws due to inclement weather (1957 and 1998). Spectator numbers were reported to be between 1,000 and 2,000.\nThe annual England versus Wales fixture continued until 2015 when England withdrew, unable to field enough players. The end of the international fixture (and the exposure it brought the game) had a dramatic effect on player numbers in Wales. By 2017, the Welsh men's league and cup fixtures were abandoned mid-season due to a lack of players at some member clubs. Since then the men's game has continued through ad-hoc fixtures. The women's league remains in operation. Subsequent years have seen the Welsh Baseball Union working with local councils to reintroduce the sport into high schools. This has seen the sport played beyond its traditional areas (especially the South Wales Valleys), as the game allows for mixed gender participation, is easy to understand, and can be adapted to accommodate a high number of players.\nNotable players.\nAmong those who achieved fame through their baseball exploits were Ted Peterson, whose international appearances stretched from the 1930s to 1960s, and Paddy Hennessey, renowned for his fast bowling. The sport's appeal to winter footballers attracted a number of players more notable for their rugby or soccer careers. Welsh Rugby players Viv Huzzey, Terry Holmes, Mark Ring, David Bishop, and Wigan Rugby League legend and record points scorer Jim Sullivan all played the sport, often during rugby's off season. Association footballers include Welshmen John Toshack, George Whitcombe, Terry Yorath, Nathan Blake and Phil Dwyer, and Everton and England football star Dixie Dean.\nDifferences between British baseball and North American games.\nThe sport differs in a number of ways from the internationally known game of North American baseball. The rules today are still very much in line with the rules created by the National Rounders Association, between 1887 and 1888.\nDespite these similarities with cricket, the game is much more like North American baseball in style and operates on a near identical, but smaller, diamond. There are also many similarities to rounders, which is often considered a transitional game between cricket and baseball. The basic concepts of British baseball cross-blend the basic concepts of cricket and the more standard versions of rounders.\nIn popular culture.\nThe sport is the subject of a song, \"The Baseball Song\", by The Hennessys, from their album \"Cardiff After Dark\"."

They joined the Mid-American Conference in 1951 and have played in the East division since the MAC went to the divisional format in 1997. Home games are held at the Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center, which opened in 1950 and is one of the oldest arenas in college basketball. Rob Senderoff was hired as head coach in 2011, the 24th coach in the program's history.\nThe Flashes gained national attention in the late 1990s and early 2000s after earning their first bid to the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in 1999. Two years later, Kent State picked up their first tournament win, followed the next year by their run to the Elite Eight in 2002 as a 10th seed where the Flashes finished the season ranked 12th nationally. The 2002 Golden Flashes also set a team record with 30 wins along with a MAC single-season record of 17 conference wins. Through the 2022–23 season, Kent State has seven total appearances in the NCAA tournament, the most recent being in 2023, along with eight appearances in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), and six in the CollegeInsider.com Tournament (CIT) and its successor The Basketball Classic (TBC). In MAC play, the Flashes have six regular-season titles, nine East division titles, and seven MAC tournament championships.\nHistory.\nThe men's basketball team is Kent State's oldest collegiate team, founded in 1913 during the first fall semester at the new Kent State Normal School campus. The team was organized, though only five men were enrolled out of the initial enrollment of 140 at the beginning of the term, as the new school was a teacher training college and thus had a predominately female student body. More men would arrive at the school in the coming weeks. They played and won their first game against Kent High School and competed against local company and high school teams for that first season, going 7–2. During the following season, Kent State played its first intercollegiate game, a 56–6 loss to Otterbein College, on January 22, 1915. An additional intercollegiate game, a 54–18 home loss to Muskingum College, was played that year along with three other games against local teams. Kent State's first intercollegiate win was recorded March 10, 1916, a 27–17 home win over Ashland College, played in the former heating plant and manual training building. A shortage of men during both World Wars prevented teams from being formed for the 1917–18, 1918–19, and 1943–44 seasons. Beginning in 1932, Kent State played as a member of the Ohio Athletic Conference before joining the Mid-American Conference and beginning league play in 1951. Kent State was placed in the East Division when the MAC went to a divisional alignment in 1997.\nDuring their first years of existence, a variety of different venues were used for home games including on-campus facilities at what is now Cartwright Hall and the old heating plant, as well as off-campus facilities at the local Congregational Church gymnasium and Theodore Roosevelt High School, until Wills Gymnasium opened in 1925. In 1950, the team moved to their current home, the Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center, known originally as the Men's Physical Education Building until 1956 and later as Memorial Gym until 1992.\nThe team played in relative anonymity for most of its existence. They made their first appearance in the MAC tournament championship game (which began in 1980) in 1984, losing a close 42–40 game. They would make the title game again in 1987 and 1989, losing both 64–63 and 67–65 respectively. The Flashes made their first post-season appearance in the 1985 National Invitation Tournament, losing in the first round. They returned to the NIT in 1989 and 1990, losing in the first round both times.\nBeginnings of success.\nIn 1996, Gary Waters was hired as head coach and began to build what would become the longest run of success in Mid-American Conference history. In 1999 the Flashes won over 20 games and defeated the Miami RedHawks in the MAC tournament championship game in Toledo to win their first MAC tournament title and make their first-ever NCAA tournament appearance, where they were defeated by Temple in the opening round at FleetCenter in Boston. The following season, the Flashes again won over 20 games and finished second in the MAC East, but failed to win the conference tournament and received their first NIT invitation since 1990. The Flashes hosted the first-round game against Rutgers and recorded their first-ever post-season win, a 73–62 victory. Kent State would win their second-round match-up at Villanova before falling in the quarterfinals at Penn State. The 2000–2001 season saw the Flashes win their first-ever MAC East title and their second tournament title to return to the NCAA tournament. The experience in the NIT proved to be valuable as Kent State scored their first win, a 77–73 upset over the fourth-seeded Indiana Hoosiers, before falling to the Cincinnati Bearcats in the second round in San Diego. At the end of the 2000–01 season, Waters accepted the head coaching job at Rutgers. While at KSU, Waters overall record was 92–60. He was succeeded at Kent State by Stan Heath.\n2001–02 season.\nKent State enjoyed its best season in 2001–02, led by seniors Trevor Huffman, Andrew Mitchell, Demetric Shaw, and Eric Thomas and junior transfer Antonio Gates. The season saw MAC records set in overall wins (30), conference wins (17), and longest winning streak (21). After beginning the season 4–4, Kent State won 20 of their next 21 games. Following their only MAC loss of the season (a 66–65 loss at Buffalo), they proceeded to win 15 straight games to close the regular season at 24–5 with a 17–1 record in the MAC and winning their first-ever MAC regular season title. After winning the 2002 MAC men's basketball tournament, the Flashes qualified for the 2002 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and were seeded tenth in the South regional bracket. After scoring a mild upset of the seventh-seeded Oklahoma State Cowboys, the Flashes gained national attention by defeating second-seeded SEC champion Alabama 71–58 to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. The Flashes followed that win with a 78–73 overtime win over third-seeded Pitt to become the first MAC team to advance to the Elite Eight since Ohio in 1964, when the tournament contained only 22 teams. The Flashes' 21-game winning streak and season came to an end in the Elite Eight with an 81–69 loss to Indiana. The Flashes finished the season at 30–6 and were ranked 12th in the final ESPN/USA Today Coaches poll released after the tournament. Following the season, Stan Heath accepted the head coaching job at the University of Arkansas, leaving after just one season and a record of 30–6. Assistant coach Jim Christian was hired later that year as the next head coach.\nJim Christian.\nThe Flashes continued their success under Jim Christian, winning over 20 games every season he was coach along with MAC East titles in 2003, 2004, 2006, and 2008; MAC overall titles in 2006 and 2008; and winning the MAC tournament again in 2006 and 2008. In both 2003 and 2004, Kent State lost in the MAC tournament championship game and received bids to the NIT. Following their 2006 MAC tournament title, they advanced to the 2006 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as a 12th seed where they lost in the opening round. In 2004, Kent State broke the MAC record for consecutive seasons with 20 or more wins by posting their sixth consecutive season. The streak is currently at ten as the 2007–2008 team won their 20th game on February 12, 2008 at Central Michigan University. In addition, Kent State broke the record for consecutive seasons with ten or more conference wins in a season by posting their ninth consecutive season of ten or more conference wins in 2006–2007, breaking the previous record of eight. The 2007–2008 season has seen several firsts and milestones for the program. On February 19, 2008, the Flashes recorded their 1,000th win in program history, a 76–66 win over the Buffalo Bulls at Buffalo's Alumni Arena. On February 24, the Flashes scored their first-ever win against a ranked team in the regular season, defeating the Saint Mary's Gaels 65–57 in Moraga, California. This was followed by Kent State's first-ever regular season ranking, rising to 23rd in the Associated Press poll and 24th in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll. With their 61–58 win at Akron on March 9 to close out the regular season, Kent State set a program record for wins in the regular season with 25, breaking the previous record of 24 set in the 2001–2002 season. Following their fifth conference tournament title, Kent State earned the highest seed in school history, a ninth seed in the Midwestern region of the 2008 NCAA tournament, where they fell to the UNLV Runnin' Rebels in the opening round. On March 29 Jim Christian resigned to take the head coaching job at Texas Christian University. He finished with a career record of 138–58 at Kent State. Christian was replaced by his top assistant coach Geno Ford, who officially took over the program on April 2.\nGeno Ford.\nGeno Ford took over the program in 2008 and led the team to three winning seasons, including two regular season MAC Championships in the 2009–10 and 2010–11 seasons. It was the first time a team had won successive MAC regular season championships since Miami in 1991 and 1992 and the first time a team had won two consecutive outright titles since Ball State in 1989 and 1990. In 2011, KSU appeared in their 11th MAC tournament championship game, but fell in overtime. Although the team failed to advance to the NCAA tournament during Ford's tenure, they did have three consecutive post-season appearances including the 2009 CollegeInsider.com Tournament and the 2010 and 2011 NITs. Kent State advanced to the second round of the 2010 NIT, winning their first post-season game since the 2002 Elite Eight run, and advanced to the quarterfinals of the 2011 NIT with two road wins. Ford left the team to take the head coaching job at Bradley University on March 27, 2011. Ford finished with a 68–37 record at Kent State.\nRob Senderoff.\nRob Senderoff, succeeded Ford as head coach on April 7, 2011 after briefly serving as interim head coach after Ford's departure. Senderoff had worked as an assistant at Kent State with Ford under Jim Christian from 2002–06 before joining the staff of Kelvin Sampson at Indiana as an assistant. Following the Kelvin Sampson recruiting controversy, Senderoff was issued a three-year show-cause penalty by the NCAA and forced to resign at Indiana. He was rehired at Kent State in 2008 as associate head coach. In his first two seasons as head coach, the Flashes continued some of their recent success, winning 20 games in each season and advancing to the CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament in 2012. The 2012–13 season was Kent State's first season not winning at least 10 MAC games since the 1997–98 season, though the team did advance to the 2013 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament where they finished 1–1. The 2013–14 team struggled to a 16–16 record and 7–11 record in MAC play, the team's worst season since a 13–17 overall record in 1997–98 and worst MAC record since a 7–11 mark in 1996–97.\nJimmy Hall played for the team in 2014-17, and his career 8.69 rebounds per game were 7th-highest in the MAC. Hall was the only Kent player to ever finish his career with 1,600 points and 800 rebounds, and his 1,683 career points are third-most in Kent history. His 672 field goals are the most in school history, and his 867 rebounds are second in school history.\nDuring Senderoff's tenure, the Flashes became the first Division I program in any team sport to sign a recruit diagnosed with autism to a National Letter of Intent. Kalin Bennett, a center from Little Rock, Arkansas, was signed in November 2018 and arrived on campus in August 2019, making his debut in the last minutes of the Flashes' 2019–20 season opener.\nMAC season results.\n\"Overall conference titles shaded in ██ gold. East division titles shaded in ██ light yellow.\"&lt;br&gt;\nMAC tournament.\nKent State has appeared in all but three Mid-American Conference tournaments since the tournament began in 1980 and through 2024 has an overall record of 48–34 in tournament play. Through 2023, the Flashes have appeared in 15 MAC title games, winning seven. The seven tournament championships are tied for most in conference history with Ohio and Ball State. The 15 title game appearances are the most in conference history.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament.\nThe Golden Flashes have appeared in seven NCAA tournaments. Their combined record is 4–7.\nNIT.\nKent State has appeared in nine National Invitation Tournaments. Their combined record is 5–9.\nCollegeInsider.com Tournament and The Basketball Classic.\nKent State appeared in the CollegeInsider.com Tournament five times with a record of 3–5. They have made one appearance in The Basketball Classic, the successor to the CollegeInsider.com Tournament, and have a record of 0–1.\nRivalries.\nThe principal rivalry for the Golden Flashes is with the Akron Zips from the University of Akron, located in Akron, Ohio, approximately southwest of Kent. The series dates back to February 19, 1916, when the two teams played in Kent in the basement of the old heating plant, won by Akron 37–16. Kent State recorded their first win in the series, a 23–21 win at Wills Gymnasium, in 1927. Through the 2022–23 season, the Flashes lead the series 83–81. Akron's longest winning streak in the series is a nine-game streak from 1942 to 1949, while Kent State's longest winning streak is five games, which has occurred three times. Kent State had a 19-game home winning streak against the Zips, which spanned from 1964 to 1998. Despite the length of the rivalry and close proximity of the campuses, the series has only been a conference meeting since 1992 when Akron joined the Mid-American Conference. Prior to 1992, the rivalry was played in the Ohio Athletic Conference (OAC) for two periods, the first from 1932, when Kent State joined the conference, until 1936, when Akron left the OAC. The second period of conference play began in 1944 after Akron returned to the OAC, and ended when Kent State left the conference in 1951 to join the MAC. When the MAC created East and West divisions in 1998, both teams were placed in the East division. Since 2011, the games count as part of the larger Wagon Wheel Challenge between the two schools.\nSince the start of MAC divisional play late 1990s, the two programs have met regularly with MAC East and overall championships on the line. Through the 2022–23 season, the Flashes and Zips have combined for 16 MAC East titles, 10 MAC regular-season championships, and 11 MAC tournament championships. The teams have often had their second meeting of the season as the regular season's final game, with several of those games featured in national broadcasts. Akron won the East division with a 66–64 overtime win at the MAC Center to end the regular season and claimed the MAC regular-season title in 2012 with a 61–55 win in Kent. The second meeting in 2010, played at James A. Rhodes Arena and broadcast nationally on ESPN, featured both teams atop the conference standings at 12–3. Kent State won the game 74–61 to clinch the MAC regular-season title. The following season, the Flashes clinched their second-consecutive MAC title with a 79–68 win over the Zips at the MAC Center in a nationally televised game on the regular season's final day, repeating the feat in 2015 with a 79–77 win over the Zips on ESPN2 to claim the regular-season and East division co-championship.\nIn the MAC tournament, the Zips and Flashes have met 11 times through the 2024 tournament, including five times in the championship game. Akron holds a 7–4 edge in all tournament games, with Kent State picking up wins in 1998, 2008, 2017, and 2023, and Akron defeating the Flashes in 2007, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2022, and 2024. In the MAC championship game, played in Cleveland at the venue now known as Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, the Zips have taken three of the five meetings. Kent State defeated the Zips 74–55 in the 2008 MAC Championship game, the Zips claimed the 2011 MAC tournament championship over Kent State with a 66–65 overtime win, Kent State won the 2017 MAC tournament championship over Akron, 70–65, and the Zips have won the past two title matchups, winning the 2022 MAC men's basketball tournament title over Kent State, 75–55, and the 2024 MAC men's basketball tournament title, 62–61, over the Flashes.\nKent State also has local rivalries with the Cleveland State Vikings from Cleveland State University and the Youngstown State Penguins from Youngstown State University, both members of the Horizon League and located in Northeast Ohio near Kent. The series with Cleveland State began in 1933 when Cleveland State was Fenn College, though was discontinued after 1945. It resumed in 1971 and has been held regularly since then. Kent State leads the Vikings 33–23 following an 83–77 win in Kent early in the 2023–24 season. The series with Youngstown State began in 1929 and lasted through 1960. It resumed in 1998 and has been held regularly since then. The Flashes lead the series 31–16 following a 111–78 Kent State win at Rhodes Arena in Akron to open the 2017–18 season, the Flashes' ninth straight win in the series. Kent State, Cleveland State, Youngstown State, and Akron created the Northeast Ohio Coaches vs. Cancer doubleheader, a season opening event featuring the region's Division I basketball programs that rotated to each of the four schools over a four-year period. Kent State hosted the inaugural doubleheader in 2015, followed by Youngstown State in 2016 at the Beeghly Center, Akron in 2017 at James A. Rhodes Arena, and Cleveland State in 2018 at the Wolstein Center."

        "title": "Alan Black (basketball)",
        "text": "Alan Black (born 1 May 1957) is an Australian former professional basketball player and coach. He is most notable for coaching both the Perth Wildcats and the Cairns Taipans in the Australian National Basketball League.\nBlack has three children, sons Stephen (former NBL player) and Andrew, and daughter Marissa.\nPlaying career.\nBlack started his NBL playing career in the league's inaugural year, 1979, playing for the Nunawading Spectres. In 1981, he was a member of the Nunawading side that lost to Launceston Casino City in the Grand Final that season. After seven seasons with the Spectres, Black made the move west in 1986 to play for the Perth Wildcats. In 1987, Black was once again a member of a losing Grand Final side when the Wildcats were defeated by the Brisbane Bullets. After only one more season with the Wildcats, Black retired from playing in 1988.\nCoaching career.\nBlack started his NBL coaching career by replacing then Wildcats head coach Cal Bruton in 1989. His rookie coaching season saw him lead the Wildcats to third on the NBL ladder (with 16 wins and 8 losses) and through to the semi-finals. In 1990 he was once again named the Wildcats head coach, but after only two games was controversially fired by the club to be replaced by Cal Bruton for the remainder of the season. That season saw the Wildcats win their very first championship with the team Black had recruited.\nIn 1993, Black became the head coach for the Illawarra Hawks and led the club into the quarter finals each year until he left the club at the end of the 1995 season. During his time with the Hawks, Black was named the NBL's Coach of the Year in both 1993 and 1995.\nBlack move to Sydney in 1996 to begin coaching the Sydney Kings. However, his tenure with the Kings was not as successful as his time with the Hawks and left the club after the 1997 season.\nIn 1998, Black returned to the Perth Wildcats as head coach, this time replacing Adrian Hurley. The following season Black's son, Stephen, began his NBL career with the Wildcats, appearing in a minor role to replace the injured Ricky Grace. He would eventually become a full member of the squad in 1999.\nThis time around, Alan Black's tenure at the Wildcats lasted considerably longer than his first, and also resulted in his first NBL championship in 1999/2000. Black coached the Wildcats for six straight seasons before history seemed to repeat itself. After being defeated by the Sydney Kings in the 2002/2003 grand final series, Black was once again fired by the club which was somewhat surprising, especially to the coach that had led them to their 7th grand final appearance. Black was replaced by his assistant coach Mike Ellis. In response to his fathers sacking, son Stephen also departed the club.\nBlack returned to the NBL as a head coach in 2005, this time for the Cairns Taipans. In his first season with the Taipans, he coached the team to their highest finish on the NBL ladder (5th) and to their first semi-final appearance. After the club went into receivership at the end of 2008, Black agreed to a pay reduction of 50% to continue to aid the floundering NBL club. Despite this he was still sacked from the team just prior to the end of the season.\nIn 2015, Black was appointed head coach of the Willetton Tigers for the 2015 MSBL season, joining his son Andrew, a player at the club. Midway through the 2016 season, Black resigned from the role to take up a consulting position in Malaysia.\nOlympic career.\nDuring the 1990s and the early 2000s, Black served as an assistant coach for the Australian Boomers, including during the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, the 1998 FIBA World Championship and the 2000 Sydney Olympics."

Some are available to the public, while others are exclusively for the members of the basketball team.\nThe team first played in the NCAA Division I tournament in 1986 when Bob Huggins was their coach. The Zips won their first MAC East division title in 1998. In 2006, the Zips received an invitation to the NIT and won their first post season game at Temple University before falling in the second round. In 2007, the team won their second MAC East title and tied the school record for wins in a season in the Division I era with 26. They also made their first appearance in the MAC Tournament Championship game, which they lost on a last-second shot 53–52 to the Miami RedHawks. The loss cost them the MAC's automatic berth and they were subsequently not selected for either the 2007 NCAA tournament or NIT, despite finishing with a 26–7 record. The Zips posted a 24–11 record (11–5 in the MAC) in 2008 which included a second-straight appearance in the MAC tournament championship game and a berth in the 2008 National Invitation Tournament.\nHistory.\nThe team was established in 1901, when the school was still known as Buchtel College, playing out of Crouse Gym, the school's original building, built in 1888. They played their first game against Mount Union College, a 120–9 loss. The team played just four games in the 1901–1902 season, winning their final two against the Western Reserve College medical school. The team's first three seasons were spent without the benefit of a head coach. This changed with the arrival of the first head coach, Earl Williams, who would coach from 1904 to 1908.\nEarly history.\nGrowing too big for Crouse, the team began playing at the Akron Armory, just a few blocks off-campus, in the 1920s. The Zips began play in the Ohio Athletic Conference in 1923 where they would compete from 1923 to 1965 except for 1936–1944 when the University left the OAC and competed as an independent. In the OAC, Akron would win 8 conference titles and five tournament titles, three of them under legendary coach, Tony Laterza. In 1954 the Zips moved into their own on-campus home, Memorial Hall, located to the east of Crouse Gym. \nAfter the 1965–1966 season Akron left the OAC for good and competed as an independent in the NCAA's College Division, which would later be renamed Division II. When the NCAA divided into three divisions in 1973, the Zips would play one season in Division III before moving to Division II, where they would play from 1975 to 1980. During the final three years as a Division II member, the Zips were part of an earlier Mid-Continent Conference for two years before joining the Ohio Valley Conference for the 1979–1980 season (though they did not play conference games until the 1980–1981 season), their last in Division II.\nThe Zips participated in the NCAA Division II tournament on seven different occasions, making the Division II Final Four three times (1964, 1966, and 1972) and reaching the championship game in 1964 and 1972, falling to Evansville and Roanoke, respectively. Coach Laterza's winning percentage at UA of .751 (178–59 from 1960 to 1968) remains best in the history of the program.\nDivision I era.\nAkron attained NCAA Division I status in 1980 and began play in the Ohio Valley Conference that fall. In 1983, the Zips moved into their current arena, the James A. Rhodes Arena, just to the east of old Memorial Hall. In 1984 Bob Huggins began coaching the team, leading the Zips to the 1986 OVC title and tournament title to gain their first berth in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as a No. 15 seed, where they fell to the 5th-ranked and No. 2-seeded Michigan Wolverines 70–64 in the first round. Akron would play one more season in the OVC and earn a berth in the 1987 National Invitation Tournament before another stint as an independent from 1987 to 1990. Huggins would lead the Zips to the 1989 NIT before leaving Akron after the season to coach at Cincinnati. Akron would rejoin the Mid-Continent Conference in 1990 and compete for two seasons before officially beginning play in the Mid-American Conference in 1992. The Zips struggled early on as members of the MAC including a disastrous 0–18 MAC season in 1995–1996 which saw the Zips finish the season 3–23 overall on a 21-game losing streak after a 3–1 start. Akron posted their first winning season in MAC play during the 1997–1998 season under coach Dan Hipsher going 13–5 and winning the first MAC East division title and qualifying for the MAC tournament for the first time. The Zips posted winning MAC records in 1998–1999 and 1999–2000 before struggling for several seasons, ultimately leading to the dismissal of Hipsher and the hiring of Keith Dambrot as head coach in 2004.\nKeith Dambrot era.\nDambrot had previously coached at nearby St. Vincent - St. Mary High School in Akron and had coached LeBron James. Dambrot lead a resurgence in Zips basketball, posting a winning record (19–10, 11–7 MAC) in the 2004–2005 season, their first winning campaign since 2000, and a second MAC East division title in 2007. Under Dambrot, the Zips had won 21 or more games in each of the last 12 seasons (beginning in 2005–2006) and had made ten postseason appearances: the 2009, 2011, and 2013 NCAA tournament, the 2006, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2017 NIT, the 2010 CBI, and the 2014 CIT. The 2006–2007 team tied the school record for wins, finishing 26–7, but failed to earn an invitation to any postseason tournament. In 2007, the Zips advanced to the MAC tournament championship game for the first time in program history, losing on a last-second shot 53–52 to the Miami RedHawks at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. They made a second appearance in 2008, falling to arch-rival Kent State 74–55. Finally, in 2009, the Zips defeated Buffalo in the MAC Championship Game and advanced to their first NCAA tournament in 23 years, falling to Gonzaga in Round One. The Zips fell to Ohio in the 2010 MAC Championship Game, but returned to beat Kent State in the 2011 MAC Championship Game (their 5th consecutive appearance in the title game) to advance to the NCAA tournament for the 2nd time in 3 seasons. Dambrot left the Zips to take a head coaching position at Duquesne University.\nJohn Groce era.\nGroce had coached at the University of Illinois since 2012 before being hired as the Head coach for the Zips. The Zips had a rough start adjusting to their new head coach, finishing 14-18 overall on the season and losing to Eastern Michigan in the Quarterfinals of the MAC tournament 58-67. During the 2019-2020 season the Zips finally caught their stride with Groce at the helm finishing the season with a record of 24-7, the best since Groce began his tenure. However, due to the COVID-19 Pandemic the MAC tournament was cancelled and no conference champion was crowned.\nMAC tournament.\nSince joining the MAC for the 1992–1993 season, the Zips have appeared in the last 23 conference tournaments, making their first appearance in 1998, the same year they won their first MAC East division title. Since then they have posted a record of 30–19 in tournament play including consecutive appearances in the championship game between 2007 and 2013 for which is the current record for consecutive appearances. Additionally, they also hold the record for best winning percentage in the MAC Tournament at 0.612.\nPostseason.\nNCAA Division I.\nThe Zips have appeared in six NCAA tournaments. Their combined record is 0–6.\nNCAA Division II.\nThe Zips appeared in eight NCAA Division II men's basketball tournaments. Their combined record was 19–8.\nNIT.\nThe Zips have appeared in seven National Invitation Tournaments. Their combined record is 3–7.\n\"Note: Beginning in 2006, the NIT began using a seeding and region system similar to what is used in the NCAA tournament.\"\nCIT.\nThe Zips have appeared in one CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament. Their record is 0–1.\nIndividual career records.\nThese records are up to date as of the 2023-2024 season."

        "text": "The 2007 Daytona 500, the 49th running of the event, was the first race of the 2007 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series season, taking place on February 18, 2007, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. Kevin Harvick won the race by 0.02 second over Mark Martin in the closest finish since the first race at Daytona International Speedway when it took three days to declare Lee Petty the winner in 1959. The race was decided by a green-white-checker finish for the third year in a row, with two extra laps added for a total of 202 laps and .\nThat was Mark Martin's first 500 race not driving for Jack Roush since 1986.\nQualifying.\nTony Stewart, driving the #20 Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS for Joe Gibbs Racing, won the first Gatorade Duel race, while Jeff Gordon drove the #24 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet to the checkered flag in the second race. However, widespread rules infractions that affected five teams – the #17 Roush Fenway Racing Ford Fusion team of Matt Kenseth, the three Evernham Motorsports Dodge Charger teams of Kasey Kahne (#9), Scott Riggs (#10) and Elliott Sadler (#19 car) – were discovered during the Pole Qualifying on February 11. But, a sixth team – the #55 Toyota Camry from Michael Waltrip Racing driven by the teams' owner – suffered the most severe punishment handed out by the motorsports sanctioning body since 2000, as it was docked 100 driver and owner points, causing it to leave Daytona with negative owner and championship points (−27 points). In addition, Gordon was penalized with the loss of his starting position after the #24 Chevrolet failed a post-race inspection because of an improper spoiler height. His starting position was changed from fourth to 42nd. There were no other penalties assessed against himself or the team and he remained listed as the winner of the second duel race.\nWhen all was said and done, Robert Yates Racing swept the top two positions, with David Gilliland driving the #38 Ford Fusion to the pole at , with his teammate, Ricky Rudd in the #88 Fusion alongside a mere 0.185 seconds behind.\nBill Elliott was not the only past Daytona 500 champion to miss the race, as 25 other cars battled for a set of seven spots in the starting grid. Ward Burton (who won in 2002) and Derrike Cope (the 1990 winner) did not qualify from their respective races. Elliott was not eligible for the past champion's provisional, as it was given to Dale Jarrett, who was the more recent champion.\nBefore the green flag the following drivers dropped to the rear of the field for the reasons indicated: #00 – David Reutimann (transmission change), #18 – J. J. Yeley (transmission change), #41 – Reed Sorenson (transmission change). #24 – Jeff Gordon (failed post race inspection after winning the Gatorade Duel race #2, Gordon was supposed to start 4th).\nPre-race.\nKelly Clarkson, the first winner of \"American Idol\" and spokesperson for the 2007 edition of \"NASCAR Day\", performed in the pre-race \"Salute to America\" concert, with her set consisting of Since U Been Gone, One Minute (from her third studio album \"My December\") and Miss Independent. Big and Rich sang the National Anthem, while Academy Award winning actor Nicolas Cage served as the grand marshal of the event, giving the command to have the drivers start their engines in a low-key manner. Baseball ironman and 2007 inductee into the Baseball Hall of Fame Cal Ripken Jr. drove the Chevrolet Corvette Z06 pace car for the pre-race laps, and Phil Parsons, the brother of Benny Parsons, who had died of complications from lung cancer prior to the season, was given the honor of dropping the green flag for the race.\nRace summary.\nDavid Gilliland was in the front of the field when the green flag waved. The first caution came on lap 16 when Boris Said moved up the track coming off of turn 2, most likely unaware that David Reutimann was there, and spun. He had very minor damage and continued the race from there. The race then stayed under the green flag for about 60 laps, during which Tony Stewart took the lead from Kurt Busch. On lap 79, Kyle Petty hit the wall after his rear tire blew out, bringing out another yellow flag. He went behind the wall for repairs. Reutimann obtained the free pass to return to the lead lap. Kurt Busch took the lead again during most of the next green flag period, only being passed by Ryan Newman for one lap on lap 128, and then by Stewart again on lap 150.\nOn lap 152, Stewart got on the apron in turn 4, got loose, and spun into Kurt Busch. He spun to a halt, while Busch kept the engine going and went to the garage area for repairs. However, with 46 laps to go, he was unable to continue and did not finish the race. A fourth caution came on lap 175 when a 5-car crash involving Reutimann, Denny Hamlin, Jimmie Johnson, Jeff Green and Tony Raines occurred in the backstretch. Mark Martin took the lead shortly before the yellow flag came out. Another crash which took out Ken Schrader happened on lap 186, after contact from Dave Blaney who was parked for the remainder of the race (who may have been unaware of his right front tire being flat according to Darrell Waltrip). With 5 laps to go, Matt Kenseth ran into Jamie McMurray, who hit the wall and collected Dale Earnhardt Jr. with him. Ricky Rudd and Martin Truex Jr. were collected as well. Rudd remained on the lead lap, but Truex fell a lap down. McMurray and Earnhardt Jr. both were out of the race, finishing 31st and 32nd, respectively. The race was delayed for approximately 12 minutes for cleanup under the red flag. This set up a green-white-checkered finish.\nWith 2 laps to go, an outside line began to form, with Kevin Harvick, Kenseth and Jeff Burton. Martin came to the white flag looking for a victory. On the backstretch, Kyle Busch, sitting 2nd place, tried both ways to get around Martin. Meanwhile, Kenseth began to bump-draft Harvick, with Burton in tow. Harvick flew by David Stremme, Gilliland, Mike Wallace, David Ragan and Greg Biffle. Busch, trying to get around Martin and block Harvick at the same, nearly squeezed Harvick into the wall as Harvick zipped past him and pulled even with Martin. Harvick and Martin, Busch and Kenseth, and Biffle and Burton were side by side out of turn 4. With the checkered flag in sight, Busch hit the apron, getting him loose. He spun out and started a chain reaction collecting most of the field. Clint Bowyer took the worst hit, turning over on his roof and skidding across the finish line on it while on fire before flipping back upright in the grass. Harvick beat Martin by .02 of a second to claim the victory. After being 6th place out of turn 4, Burton finished 3rd. Mike Wallace and David Ragan were surprises, rounding out the Top 5.\nControversy over the finish.\nBecause of an incident between Casey Mears and Dale Jarrett at the 2003 Sylvania 300 in New Hampshire International Speedway, NASCAR mandated a \"freezing of the field\" policy whenever a caution flag is thrown, effectively ending the phenomenon that is racing back to the caution. Such a flag did not fly after the last-lap crash. There is some disputed visual evidence that suggests that, if the caution had flown strictly according to NASCAR rules, Martin may have won.\nThe issue was especially passionate because Martin was in his 23rd Daytona 500 start and had never won. Such a win, arguably, would have been popular with fans, similar to Dale Earnhardt's 1998 victory (in his 20th start) or Darrell Waltrip's 1989 triumph (in his 17th). Martin retired following the 2013 season, never having achieved a Daytona 500 victory in his 29 attempts.\nIn some races, NASCAR has permitted the cars to run to the finish in case of more \"minor\" spins on the last lap."

        "title": "Couch surfing",
        "text": "Couch surfing is a term that is generally defined as when an individual moves from house to house, sleeping in whatever spare space is available, oftentimes a couch or floor, generally staying a few days before moving on to the next house. People sometimes couch surf when they are travelling or because they are homeless.\nCouch surfing in travel.\nCouch surfing's cultural significance grew when the website CouchSurfing was launched in 2004. Upon the release of the app, what previously used to be a cheap alternative for budget travelers became recognized as a hip, new way to travel. Couch surfing became not only a way to save money, but a way to meet new people and have new experiences. Its attraction was in the way it allowed people to have a more immersive and authentic travel experience. Besides CouchSurfing, many other platforms were created and groups were formed in order to help people who are looking to couch surf connect with potential hosts and other travelers. While couch surfing may not be considered the most popular or mainstream way to travel, in 2018 around 15 million people had identified using couch surfing accommodations to travel. However, couch surfing comes with the issue of safety. It can be less regulated than traditional forms of travel accommodations, making it a more risky choice for vulnerable travelers.\nCouch surfing as homelessness.\nCouch surfing is also considered a form of homelessness. It is the most common type of homelessness amongst youth. It can be a result of substance abuse, conflict in home relationships, or aftermath of leaving abusive situations. The individual may turn to couch surfing as a temporary solution, staying with friends or family members while they search for permanent housing or a way to get back on their feet. It is different from sleeping on the streets or in a shelter, but it still has significant challenges, including the lack of stability and the strain on an individual. Couch surfing homelessness can be a short-term solution to homelessness, but it is not a sustainable solution in the long term. Individuals experiencing couch surfing homelessness often face uncertainty and instability, which can lead to negative consequences such as difficulty in finding employment, social isolation, and mental health issues.\nCouch surfing is usually missed by homeless counts and is therefore a type of hidden homelessness. For example, in 2017, HUD counted 114 thousand children as homeless in the United States in their homeless count, while surveys conducted by the Department of Education concluded there were 1.3 million. Couch surfing is especially common among those under the age of 25, including children. In Britain, 1 in 5 young people have couch surfed at least once each year, and almost half of those have done so for more than a month.\nWhile safer than sleeping in the rough, couch surfing is not an adequate long term housing solution. Most couch surfers only stay in a single home for a short period of time. This may be because their host limits their stay, they voluntarily leave to preserve friendships, or they are forced to leave the home of a person who is abusive or has a drug problem. Some couch surfers have received housing in exchange for services such as cooking and cleaning. In other cases, people will have otherwise unwanted sexual encounters to be able to couch surf at a person's home for the night. Those who couch surf often sleep in the rough after leaving their accommodations."

        "text": "John David Bevan (12 March 1948 – 5 June 1986) was a Welsh international rugby union footballer, one of two John Bevans who played for Wales during the 1970s.\nBevan was born in Neath. He played for Aberavon RFC, the British Lions and The Barbarians. He formed a formidable club half back partnership with Clive Shell, and was a player got the most out of players outside of him. During his playing career he rivalled Phil Bennett for the Welsh No 10 position. Bennett originally held the place but the club performances of Bevan put him in the ascendancy during the 1974–75 season.\nA fly half, capped four times for Wales, he won his first cap against France in Paris in January 1975, following a sound performance playing for The Barbarians in the drawn game (12–12) against the touring All Blacks at Twickenham the previous month. During the Paris test, he was one of six Welsh players making their debut (Trevor Evans, Charlie Faulkner, Graham Price, Ray Gravell and Steve Fenwick being the others). Wales won for the first time in Paris for many years by 25–12 points with Bevan producing a remarkable try-saving tackle.\nEngland were the next opponents for the unchanged Welsh and were hammered 20–4 at Cardiff Arms Park. Next up were Scotland at Murrayfield where Bevan sustained a dislocated shoulder. He was replaced by Bennett and Wales lost the match 12–10. Bevan’s season was over.\nIn the 1975–76 season Bevan won his place back and was selected to face the touring Wallabies in Cardiff. His ability to make space for others resulted in Wales winning the fixture 28-3, J.J. Williams, scoring three tries.\nBevan was picked for the first Five Nations international against England, with the young David Richards on the bench, remarkably at the expense of Bennett who was omitted from the squad. In a twist of fate, both Bevan and Richards obtained injuries and Bennett was recalled. Wales beat England and went on to win the Grand Slam. Bevan never played for his country again.\nBevan, a schoolteacher at Dyffryn Comprehensive at Port Talbot toured New Zealand with the British Lions on their 1977 tour but did not play in any of the internationals against the All Blacks, although, following a dip in form of the tour captain Phil Bennett, many thought he should have been picked for the final test. Bevan was one of three Aberavon players to make the 1977 tour, Allan Martin lock and Clive Williams prop being the others.\nAfter his playing career was cut short by his shoulder injury, he coached Aberavon RFC and then the Wales national side from 1982 to 1985. He was forced to retire on the grounds of ill health.\nBevan was also a cricketer, an opening batsman who captained Neath Cricket Club and represented his country.\nHe died of cancer aged 38 in 1986, survived by his wife Judith, a son and a daughter."

Some of these events grew into the Manx Cycling Week, which followed and was based on the TT motorcycle races. The biggest races were the Manx International, over three laps of the Snaefell TT course, and the Manx Premier for professional riders using a shorter circuit through Clypse.\nThe Isle of Man Cycling Association administers racing on the island and selects teams to represent it but the island is otherwise represented by British Cycling."
