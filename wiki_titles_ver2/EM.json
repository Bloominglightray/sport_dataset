        "title": "British Volleyball Federation",
        "text": "The British Volleyball Federation (BVF) is the national sports governing for volleyball participation in the UK. It is a Home Nations federation of Volleyball England, Volleyball Wales, Scottish Volleyball and Northern Ireland Volleyball. It lobbies the UK government for funding to help elite volleyball athletes compete internationally.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nThe BVF was formed as the Amateur Volleyball Association of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1955. It was revived in 1980 as the British Volleyball Federation, and registered as a company on 21 July 2008.\nIt ran annual competitions between teams from the Home Nations from 1985-1991. In 1990 it appointed a full-time coach. In late 1992, it developed the idea of opening a national training centre for team volleyball at Sheffield. It would be the first team sport in Britain to have such a centre.\nOlympic Representation.\nThe BVF planned for Britain to send a Great Britain volleyball team to the Olympics in 1992, but this never occurred. Home Nations teams continued to represent Britain in other international competitions. British volleyball was not funded well in the 1990s. For the 1996 Olympics, beach volleyball pair Audrey Cooper (aged 31) and Amanda Glover (aged 25) qualified after practising on Bournemouth beach, and this was the first time that Britain had ever qualified for any volleyball discipline in the Olympics. After qualifying, in March 1996, they trained in Amsterdam because Britain had no permanent beach volleyball courts.\nThe London 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympics set goals for GBR representation in Indoor Volleyball, Beach Volleyball and Sitting Volleyball. An intense programme of 5 years with UK Sport funding brought GBR teams to the point of qualification as hosts. UKSport reduced funding to BVF and de-funded the Women's Indoor and Men's Beach programmes. Notwithstanding this, all 6 disciplines played on and met the credibility threshold set by the British Olympic Association (NOC). They took the courts in August 2012 at Earls Court, Horseguards Parade and the ExCel Centre. \nThe British Volleyball Federation continues to lead and focus on elite representation for the UK in all six volleyball team disciplines in the Olympic and Paralympic movement. In common with many other GBR Olympic sports the funding from the current government sports agency ukSport has been minimal for preparations to achieve qualification for the Rio Games of 2016. Notwithstanding this, BVF continues to press forward with the support of the World and European authorities (FIVB and CEV).\nBeach Volleyball Olympic Legacy.\nPrior to the London 2012 Olympics, funding for beach courts in Britain was difficult because the BVF was funded by the Sports Council, and could not therefore apply for National Lottery grants. Since that time, the number of Beach Volleyball Clubs and Courts has greatly increased, and competitions such as the UK Beach Tour help to develop UK athletes. Beach Volleyball made its Youth Commonwealth Games debut in the Bahamas in 2017, followed by the Commonwealth Games in the Gold Coast in 2018, with representation from Home Nations teams, It will also be part of the official programme for the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games.\nHeadquarters.\nThe BVF was headquartered at the English Institute of Sport – Sheffield in the runup to the 2012 London Games and was sponsored by Vertex. Training for both men's and women's teams took place at Sheffield and Beach Pairs abroad. Since the 2012 Games, BVF has downsized and its administration is supported at Loughborough by the Volleyball England staff.\nFunction.\nThe BVF disciplines include:"

        "text": "The men's 50 metre freestyle event at the 2012 Summer Olympics took place on 2–3 August at the London Aquatics Centre in London, United Kingdom.\nFrance's Florent Manaudou stunned the entire field to join his sister Laure Manaudou on top of the podium for the Olympic sprint freestyle title. Swimming in lane seven, the dark horse threw down a scorching time and a textile best of 21.34 to hold off U.S. swimmer Cullen Jones and the event's Brazilian world record holder and defending Olympic champion César Cielo by two-tenths of a second, a sizable chunk in the Olympic swimming's shortest race. Jones took home the silver in 21.54 to match his semifinal time in the process, while Cielo missed his chance to defend the title with a bronze medal in 21.59.\nCielo's teammate Bruno Fratus finished outside the podium by almost a fingertip with a fourth-place time in 21.61. After twelve years of absence as a 31-year-old, U.S. swimmer Anthony Ervin, who previously tied with Gary Hall, Jr. for the gold in 2000, managed to pull off a fifth-place finish in 21.78. Ervin was followed in sixth and seventh by four-time Olympians Roland Mark Schoeman of South Africa (21.80) and George Bovell of Trinidad and Tobago (21.82). Plagued by injury, Australia's Eamon Sullivan struggled to mount a sprint challenge in a high-calibre race as he finished eighth in 21.98.\nEarlier in the semifinals, Australia's top sprinter James Magnussen missed the star-studded roster with an eleventh-place time in 22.00. Other notable swimmers featured Swedish veteran Stefan Nystrand (22.32) and France's Amaury Leveaux (22.35), the defending silver medalist, both of whom fell short of the semifinal field by a small fraction of a second on the morning prelims.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nQualification.\nThe Olympic Qualifying Time for the event was 22.11 seconds. Up to two swimmers per National Olympic Committee (NOC) could automatically qualify by swimming that time at an approved qualification event. The Olympic Selection Time was 22.88 seconds. Up to one swimmer per NOC meeting that time was eligible for selection, allocated by world ranking until the maximum quota for all swimming events was reached. NOCs without a male swimmer qualified in any event could also use their universality place.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition consists of three rounds: heats, semifinals, and a final. The swimmers with the best 16 times in the heats advance to the semifinals. The swimmers with the best 8 times in the semifinals advance to the final. Swim-offs are used as necessary to break ties for advancement to the next round.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe swimmers with the top 16 times, regardless of heat, advanced to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nThe swimmers with the top 8 times, regardless of heat, advanced to the final."

She blistered the field with a sterling time and a textile best in 24.05 to slice off Steffen's previous Olympic record by a hundredth of a second (0.01). Belarus' Aliaksandra Herasimenia added a second silver to her Olympic hardware in a national record of 24.28, while Kromowidjojo's teammate Marleen Veldhuis edged out the scorching Steffen (24.46) by 0.07 seconds to snatch the bronze in 24.39, handing over an entire medal haul for the Dutch squad with a one–three finish.\nGreat Britain's home favorite Francesca Halsall finished behind Steffen by a fingertip with a fifth-place time in 24.47. Meanwhile, Sweden's Therese Alshammar shook off a pinched nerve injury to officially compete in her fifth Olympics, but managed only to claim a sixth spot in 24.61. U.S. swimmer Jessica Hardy (24.62) and the Bahamas' Arianna Vanderpool-Wallace (24.69) rounded out the field in a splash-and-dash finale.\nNotable swimmers missed the top-eight final including Aussie sisters Bronte and Cate Campbell, defending bronze medalist; and Halsall's teammate Amy Smith, who finished outside the roster by 16-hundredths of a second with a ninth-place time in 24.87. Earlier on the morning prelims, Smith picked up a sixteenth spot in a most exciting three-way swim-off against U.S. sprinter Kara Lynn Joyce and Iceland's Sarah Blake Bateman after they each posted a matching time of 25.28.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nThe following records were established during the competition:"

There were 56 competitors from 49 nations. The event was won by Nathan Adrian of the United States.\nSummary.\nIn one of the closest finishes in Olympic history, Nathan Adrian touched out Australia's favorite James Magnussen at the wall by a fingertip to win the event at the Olympics for the Americans for the first time since Matt Biondi topped the podium in 1988. Coming from third at the halfway turn, Adrian powered home on the final stretch, finishing in 47.52 to edge out Magnussen, also known as \"The Missile\", by a hundredth of a second (0.01). Meanwhile, Magnussen won a second straight silver for the Aussies in 47.53, adding more than four tenths of a second from his best time of 47.10 at the 2012 Australian Championships. Canada's Brent Hayden picked up the bronze in 47.80, winning his first Olympic medal and handing the Canadians their first ever medal in the event's history.\nAfter claiming two golds and a silver in the past four days, France's Yannick Agnel could not produce his similar effort with a fourth-place time in 47.84. Meanwhile, Netherlands' Sebastiaan Verschuren pulled off a fifth-place finish in 47.88. Heading into the halfway turn with an early lead, Brazil's world record holder César Cielo dropped to sixth in 47.92. Cuba's Hanser García (48.04) and Russia's Nikita Lobintsev (48.44) rounded out a historic finale.\nBackground.\nThis was the twenty-sixth appearance of the men's 100 metre freestyle. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1900 (when the shortest freestyle was the 200 metres), though the 1904 version was measured in yards rather than metres.\nTwo of the eight finalists from the 2008 Games returned: bronze medalist César Cielo of Brazil and eighth-place finisher Stefan Nystrand of Sweden. The favorite coming into the event was James Magnussen of Australia, the 2011 world champion and textile-suit world best holder. Cielo had been the 2009 world champion; his world record (set in a skinsuit) still stands as of 2020. Canadian Brent Hayden was the runner-up in the 2011 world championships. French relay anchor Yannick Agnel was also a contender.\nGrenada, Mali, Paraguay, Tanzania, and Turkmenistan each made their debut in the event. The United States made its 25th appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the boycotted 1980 Games.\nQualification.\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to two swimmers if both met the Olympic Qualifying Time (or \"OQT\"). An NOC with no swimmers meeting the OQT but at least one swimmer meeting the Olympic Selection Time (or \"OST\") was not guaranteed a place, but was eligible for selection to fill the overall 900 swimmer quota for the Games. For 2012, the OQT was 48.82 seconds while the OST was 50.53 seconds. The qualifying window was 1 March 2011 to 3 July 2012; only approved meets (generally international competitions and national Olympic trials) during that period could be used to meet the standards. There were also universality places available; if no male swimmer from a nation qualified in any event, the NOC could enter one male swimmer in an event.\nEight nations (Australia, Brazil, the Cayman Islands, France, Italy, Russia, South Africa, and the United States) had two swimmers meet the OQT. Five more (Canada, Cuba, Germany, the Netherlands, and Poland) had one swimmer qualify through the OQT. 18 NOCs received a place through OST selection. 21 nations used universality places in the men's 100 metre freestyle.\nThe two swimmers per NOC limit had been in place since the 1984 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThis freestyle swimming competition consisted of three rounds: heats, semifinals, and a final. The swimmers with the best 16 times in the heats advanced to the semifinals. The swimmers with the best 8 times in the semifinals advanced to the final. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties for advancement to the next round.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nNo new world or Olympic records were set during the competition. It was the first Olympics where non-textile suits were banned.\nSchedule.\nThe competition returned to a two-day schedule, with heats and semifinals on the same day."

Billed as the \"Race of the Century\", he came up again with a spectacular swim on the final stretch to hit the wall first in 1:43.14, posting a textile best in the process and moving rapidly to third in the world's all time rankings.

The top 16 swimmers from the heats advanced to the semifinals. The top 8 semifinalists advanced to the final. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nThis swimming event used freestyle swimming, which means that the method of the stroke is not regulated (unlike backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly events). Nearly all swimmers use the front crawl or a variant of that stroke. Because an Olympic-size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of four lengths of the pool.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nSchedule.\nThe competition returned to a two-day schedule, with heats and semifinals on the same day.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe top 16 advanced to the semifinals."

Trailing behind at the 150-metre turn, he made a late charge on the final lap to edge out Japan's Ryosuke Irie and defending champion Ryan Lochte for an Olympic record and a gold medal in 1:53.41. Clary's gold was the fifth consecutive (and eighth overall) victory by an American swimmer in the event, all by different men. Irie also overhauled Lochte about the midway through the leg, but could not catch Clary near the wall to finish only with a silver in 1:53.78.

It was first held in 1900. The event did not return until 1964; since then, it has been on the programme at every Summer Games. From 1904 to 1960, a men's 100 metre backstroke was held instead. In 1964, only the 200 metres was held. Beginning in 1968 and ever since, both the 100 and 200 metre versions have been held.\nThree of the 8 finalists from the 2008 Games returned: gold medalist Ryan Lochte of the United States, bronze medalist Arkady Vyatchanin of Russia, and fifth-place finisher Ryosuke Irie of Japan. Lochte and Irie had each earned medals in the event at both the 2009 and 2011 World Championships, with Irie both times coming in second; in 2009, behind Aaron Peirsol and ahead of Lochte, and in 2011 behind Lochte and ahead of Tyler Clary of the United States. Lochte was favoured to become only the second man to repeat as Olympic champion in the event (Roland Matthes did so in 1968 and 1972).\nFor the first time, no nations made their debut in the event. Australia and Great Britain each made their 13th appearance, tied for most among nations to that point.\nQualification.\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to two swimmers if both met the Olympic Qualifying Time (or \"OQT\"). An NOC with no swimmers meeting the OQT but at least one swimmer meeting the Olympic Selection Time (or \"OST\") was not guaranteed a place, but was eligible for selection to fill the overall 900 swimmer quota for the Games. For 2012, the OQT was 1:58.48 while the OST was 2:02.63. The qualifying window was 1 March 2011 to 3 July 2012; only approved meets (generally international competitions and national Olympic trials) during that period could be used to meet the standards. There were also universality places available; if no male swimmer from a nation qualified in any event, the NOC could enter one male swimmer in an event.\nThe two swimmers per NOC limit had been in place since the 1984 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition followed the format established in 2000, with three rounds: heats, semifinals, and a final. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952. A swimmer's place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. The top 16 swimmers from the heats advanced to the semifinals. The top 8 semifinalists advanced to the final. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nThis swimming event used backstroke.

Leading from the start, the fearsome foursome of Missy Franklin (58.50), Rebecca Soni (1:04.82), Dana Vollmer (55.48), and Allison Schmitt (53.25) put together a perfect ending with a stunning gold-medal time in 3:52.05 to shave off China's global standard by 14-hundredths of a second from the 2009 World Championships at the peak of the high-tech bodysuit era.\nAustralia's Emily Seebohm (59.01), Leisel Jones (1:06.06), Alicia Coutts (56.41), and Melanie Schlanger (52.54) trailed behind their formidable rivals by a couple of seconds, but managed to take home a magnificent silver in 3:54.02. Pulling off a second-place finish, Jones also matched Ian Thorpe for the most medals by an Australian swimmer in her fourth straight Olympics with a remarkable overall tally of nine (three golds, five silver, and one bronze).\nJapan's Aya Terakawa (58.99), Satomi Suzuki (1:05.96), Yuka Kato (57.36), and Haruka Ueda (53.42) ended on a spectacular fashion with a bronze medal in 3:55.73, holding off the robust Russian quartet of Anastasia Zuyeva (59.13), Yuliya Yefimova (1:04.98), Irina Bespalova (58.59), and Veronika Popova (53.33) by exactly three-tenths of a second (0.30), a fourth-place time in 3:56.03.\nOutside the podium, China's Zhao Jing (59.86), Ji Liping (1:06.94), Lu Ying (56.80), and Tang Yi (52.81) could not produce a similar stellar performance in the medley relay with a fifth-place finish in 3:56.41, while the Dutch foursome of Sharon van Rouwendaal (1:00.72), Moniek Nijhuis (1:06.74), Inge Dekker (56.91), and star Ranomi Kromowidjojo (52.91), who captured another sprint freestyle title an hour earlier, claimed a distant sixth spot in 3:57.28.

Around the 7 km mark, Mellouli quickly opened up a three-body-length lead over a small pack of swimmers, and maintained a fast pace to claim his second gold and third career medal in 1:49:55.1. Chasing for two more Olympic medals in a grueling race, Germany's Thomas Lurz finished behind the leader by 3.4 seconds with a silver in 1:49:58.5, while Canada's Richard Weinberger, who pulled off a powerful lead on the first lap, grabbed the bronze in 1:50:00.3.\nGreece's Spyridon Gianniotis, the reigning world champion, mounted a spirited challenge against Mellouli, Lurz and Weinberger in pursuit, but dropped back in the last 200 metres to fourth in 1:50:05.3.

Born in Blackwood, Caerphilly, he played for Blackwood RFC and Pontypridd RFC, as well as the Wales Sevens team.\nWilliams began playing for Blackwood in the club's junior division at the age of 11. While playing for the youth team, Williams began to suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome, which rendered him unable to play for two seasons. By 2007, his health had improved to the point where he was able to join the Blackwood senior team. In February 2008, Pontypridd RFC visited Blackwood's Glan-yr-Afon Park for a Konica Minolta Cup match, in which Williams impressed enough for the Premiership side to sign him on permit for the rest of the 2007–08 season; Williams' season culminated with him starting for Pontypridd in the Konica Minolta Cup Final against Neath. Ponty signed Williams permanently ahead of the 2008–09 season.\nIn early 2011, Williams was called up to the Wales Sevens Development Team, and captained the team for a FIRA–AER tournament in Spain. In December that year, he was called up to the senior Wales Sevens team for the 2011 South Africa Sevens, helping the team to win the Plate after being eliminated from the Cup in the quarter-finals. A successful year saw Williams nominated for the Pontypridd RFC Player of the Year award for 2011. He left Pontypridd at the end of the 2013–14 season. He then joined Ebbw Vale RFC, before moving to Newport RFC in January 2016. In June 2017, he signed for Pontypool RFC.\nWilliams is also a maths teacher, working at Ferndale Comprehensive School in the Rhondda."

He was drafted 2nd overall by Rain or Shine in the 2011 PBA draft.\nEarly life and education.\nPaul John Lee was born on February 14, 1989, to Edwin Lee and Helen Dalistan. Due to his parents' being unmarried at the time of his birth, his legal surname at birth was his mother's maiden surname, Dalistan. His parents would get married on October of the following year.\nLee was born in Tondo, Manila, to a family of three children. While his paternal ancestors of Chinese roots had a history of being involved in the lumber industry since the 19th century, Lee's family did not inherit much wealth. Paul John's family lived as a lower middle class household, with his father working as a pedicab driver and his mother briefly working as a domestic worker in the Middle East. His family would avoid seeking financial assistance from their other relatives.\nAs a young teenager, Lee would already play basketball and join local competitions in Tondo.\nLee would attend high school at the San Sebastian College – Recoletos. He would move to the University of the East to pursue a college education under a full scholarship.\nAmateur career.\nHigh school.\nWhen he was a high school freshman in San Sebastian College – Recoletos, he was discovered when he was playing in the school’s intramurals. The coach spotted him, made him try out and placed him in the lineup the following year. The San Sebastian Staglets would go on to win the NCAA Juniors Championship in his senior year.\nCollege.\nAfter his high school career ended, Lee accounts that no university team gave him an invitation to play for their team. He would receive an endorsement from the father of his San Sebastian teammate Raphy Reyes to play for the University of the East.\nIn 2007, he was recruited by then coach Dindo Pumaren of the University of the East, which at that time had formidable backcourt players like Raphy Reyes, Paul Zamar, James Martinez and Marcy Arellano. His role during that time was with the second squad. He was known as the 6th man, the main replacement for then King Warrior Marcy Arellano. In 2009, his game flourished when Lawrence Chongson took over to coach the team.

By the end of the 2011–12 PBA season, he was awarded Rookie of the Year, and won his first ever PBA championship with the Elasto Painters, though he did not play in the championship series due to injury.\nIn 2014, he requested the Rain or Shine management to trade him by personally calling up coach Yeng Guiao. However, Guiao and the Rain or Shine management are hell bent on keeping him at all cost. After Lee returned from Spain following his Gilas stint in the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup, he went to a sabbatical by not showing up to Rain or Shine practice or even talking to the media, creating speculations of him pushing through signing up with another team.

        "text": "Civil Service NI Rugby Football Club is a rugby union club based in Maynard Sinclair Pavilion of Belfast, Northern Ireland. The club was formed in the autumn of 1922 by staff of the newly established Northern Ireland Civil Service. After some years of success playing at a junior level, the club was given senior status by the Ulster Branch in the 1928/29 season and celebrated by winning the senior league at its first attempt. Up until World War II, Civil Service teams enjoyed high placings in the league tables but struggled to convert good performances into trophies.\nPlaying performances however improved steadily throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Service junior teams won league and cup competitions and the 1st XV won the Ulster Senior League in 1969-70. They also enjoyed something of a tradition in sevens winning a number of the premier competitions in Ulster at that time. In more recent times Civil Service has competed at more modest levels as it no longer has senior status. However, the Club also enjoyed successes in league and cup competitions in the 1990s. The 1st XV won the McCrea Cup in 1998, followed by triumphs in Qualifying League 3 and the North Down Cup.\nClub Captains.\n2022- C. Stone\n2020 - 22 - J. Duffin\n2019 - 20 - P.

Indeed this group of players became the spine of the senior sides over the past decade and led to a resurgence in form and fortune in 2012 the 2nd XV got promotion to the Junior rugby section of Ulster rugby. The Club went on to reclaim both the Wolfhound Cup and the Old Campbellian's Boxing Day Cup after years without their hands on the respective cups.\nHistoric 1st XV League Performance.\nThe club had its most successful league campaign in almost a decade under then Captain Michael Murray 2012-13. \nHonours.\nUlster Senior Cup: Runner up 1933-34\nUlster Senior League: Winners 1928/29, 1969/70\nUlster Junior Cup: Runner up 1967-68\nMcCrea Cup: Winners 1997-98\nDistinguished Players.\nThe Club has a long tradition of producing players, referees and officials who gained international and representative recognition. Several players were capped by Ulster and Ireland, while others who passed through the ranks of Service teams achieved similar honours, including British Lions status. The Club has provided 4 Presidents of the Ulster Branch and others who served on various committees.\nThe Club's most distinguished son was perhaps Dudley Higgins, an accomplished full back, who gained caps during the 1948 Five Nations Championship, and in doing so became one of the elite band of players who have won a Grand Slam for Ireland. Dudley went on to become President of the Ulster Branch in 1960/61 and of the IRFU in 1976-77."

        "title": "Rugby union in London",
        "text": "Rugby union is one of the most popular sports, in terms of both participants and spectators in London. London has several of England's leading rugby union clubs, and the city is home to 13 teams playing in national leagues, and many regional amateur leagues regulated by the London and South East Division Rugby Football Union. However, several of these teams, due to necessity, have found homes at stadia outside the boundaries of the capital. The sport is well established, especially in the middle-class suburbs to the north and west of the city. Four of the twelve clubs currently in the Gallagher Premiership have London origins.\nIn more recent years, a modern tradition has seen the four leading London clubs play out of Twickenham Stadium during the first round of the Premiership, in a double-header.\nHistory.\nBarnes Rugby Football Club, formerly known simply as the Barnes Club, is a rugby union club which is claimed by some sources to be the world's first and oldest club in any code of football. The club, from Barnes in London, also played a major role in the early years of association football, and was one of the teams in the first ever game of football. Blackheath F.C. is the oldest open rugby club in the world. \"Open\" in this context means that membership was open to anyone, not merely those attending, or old boys from, a particular institution (e.g. a school, university or hospital). It is also the third-oldest rugby club in continuous existence in the world, after Dublin University Football Club and Edinburgh Academical Football Club. The Blackheath club also helped organise the world's first rugby international (between England and Scotland in Edinburgh on 27 March 1871) and hosted the first international between England and Wales ten years later – the players meeting and getting changed at the Princess of Wales public house. Blackheath, along with Civil Service FC, is one of the two clubs that can claim to be a founder member of both the Football Association and the Rugby Football Union.\nClubs.\nLondon has several teams playing rugby at the National League level, in levels 1-5.\nThese teams play in the Premiership:\nThese other Greater London teams compete in the RFU Championship:\nThere is also Wasps RFC with links to the London area. Once nicknamed [and called] 'London Wasps' they have played at many locations since the development of the professional game. These have included Loftus Road, followed by High Wycombe and now Coventry. Their affiliated Amateur side, Wasps FC, still play at the original ground in Acton.\nAnother club with London roots, London Welsh, have bounced between the Premiership and Championship in recent years, having been promoted to or relegated from the Premiership at the end of each season since 2011–12. When they were first promoted for the 2012–13 season, they moved outside the metropolitan area to play at Oxford United's Kassam Stadium in Oxford. They remained in Oxford until their most recent relegation at the end of the 2014–15 season, after which they returned to Greater London at Old Deer Park in Richmond. The club went into liquidation in January 2017, and had its results for season 2016-17 expunged from the record. However, the club's amateur arm continues due to holding separate registration.\nThe remaining teams play at lower levels of the pyramid:\nStill another Premiership club with London roots, Wasps moved their home matches entirely outside the London commuter belt to Coventry in December 2014. Shortly before their move, Wasps purchased the major football ground Ricoh Arena, and share it with Coventry City F.C. Wasps maintained their training base within Greater London in West Acton until June 2016 but are now fully based in the West Midlands.\nInternational rugby.\nThe England national rugby union team play their home matches at Twickenham Stadium during the Six Nations Championship, as well as the November inbound touring nations. The ground also hosted the Rugby World Cup finals in 1991, in which Australia defeated England, and 2015, with New Zealand defeating Australia. Twickenham hosts the final of the Anglo-Welsh Cup, and has hosted the final of European club rugby's top competition, now known as the European Rugby Champions Cup, five times, most recently in 2015. The stadium is also host to The Varsity Match between Oxford and Cambridge as well as the English schools' Daily Mail Cup final. London was also home to the massive celebrations for the English rugby team when they returned home from Australia after winning the 2003 Rugby World Cup, where Jonny Wilkinson kicked a drop-goal in extra time. An estimated 750,000 gathered in Trafalgar Square to celebrate their arrival.\nSevens.\nIn rugby sevens, Twickenham Stadium annually hosts the London Sevens, the final event of the annual World Rugby Sevens Series for men's national teams. In 2014–15, it also hosted the third-place match and Cup (championship) final of the London Women's Sevens, part of the World Rugby Women's Sevens Series. The remainder of the latter event was held at the nearby Twickenham Stoop. The London Women's Sevens was originally planned to be an annual event, but did not appear on the 2015–16 series schedule."

He was drafted with the 20th overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls.\nBorn in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, Snell moved to Phoenix, Arizona before his senior year to finish high school at Westwind Preparatory Academy. Snell was the starting shooting guard for the New Mexico Lobos in his sophomore and junior seasons, helping lead the Lobos to back-to-back Mountain West Conference (MWC) regular season and conference tournament championships as well as NCAA tournament bids.\nHigh school career.\nSnell attended Martin Luther King High School in Riverside, California, in 2008–09, where he and teammate Kawhi Leonard, a future two-time NBA Finals MVP, led the Wolves to a 30–3 season and a number 7 national ranking in the MaxPreps/National Guard computer rankings. Snell averaged 14 points, seven rebounds, four blocks, and five assists per game. In 2009 Snell enrolled at Westwind Preparatory Academy in Phoenix, where he averaged 19.5 points, 10 rebounds, 8.8 assists, 2.7 steals, and 1.8 blocks. At Westwind he was a teammate of Jamaal Franklin, who went on to play for San Diego State University and was drafted by the Memphis Grizzlies in 2013.\nCollege career.\n2010–11 season: Freshman year.\nIn 2009, ESPN scouting reports called Snell \"one of the top sleepers on the West Coast\" and a \"diamond in the rough\". Snell committed to play for the New Mexico Lobos on September 15, 2009, and signed in November 2009.\nThe 2010-11 Lobo squad was young and inexperienced, led by lone senior Dairese Gary and UCLA transfer Drew Gordon. Snell was one of four freshmen playing significant minutes, along with Kendall Williams, Alex Kirk, and Cameron Bairstow, one of the most accomplished recruiting classes in Lobo history. The team had a roller-coaster season, starting 10-1 and later winning four straight twice, but also losing four straight and six of nine. They beat number 3 BYU in Provo late in the season, but lost to the Cougars in the MWC tournament. The Lobos received a bid to the 2011 National Invitation Tournament and beat UTEP before losing at Alabama to finish the season 22–13.\nSnell played in all but one game, averaging 4.4 points and two rebounds. He scored in double-figures four times and led the team in scoring twice. He had a breakout performance with 16 points against then-number 9 BYU, hitting four three-pointers, followed two games later by a season-best 19, with five threes, against Wyoming. He started seven games, averaging 8.3 points in his starts, and in one seven-game stretch he averaged 10.3 points a game and shot 17-31 (.548) from three. A sprained ankle late in the season limited his play and cut his production, as he managed just 11 points in the last eight games of the season.\n2011–12 season: Sophomore year.\nThe Lobos in 2011-12 were anchored by the dominant inside play of Gordon, who tallied 19 double-doubles and whose 11.1 rebounds per game were fourth in the nation. The team allowed just 59.3 points per game, the lowest ever for the Lobos in the shot clock era, and they held opponents under 40% shooting for the first time since the 1964–65 season. Their scoring defense was fourteenth nationally, and their defensive field goal percentage was seventh.\nSnell was among several young guards battling for playing time going into the season, as senior and three-year starter Phillip McDonald was hampered by injury. Snell earned a starting spot after \"tearing it up in practice\" and playing well in preseason exhibition games. He was capable of explosive scoring, but he was also prone to becoming tentative and falling into slumps. He scored in double-figures in twenty games, including three games over 20, twice scoring 24, hitting six threes in one of those games; yet he also scored six or fewer points in eleven games, going scoreless for two straight games at one point. For the season, Snell averaged 10.5 points, 2.7 rebounds, and 2.3 assists a game.\nThe Lobos won thirteen straight early in the season on the way to a 15–2 record. They lost their next two games to No. 16 San Diego State and at No. 14 UNLV but then won seven straight, avenging those losses and climbing into the top twenty with a 22–4 record. After two upset losses they settled for a share of the MWC regular season championship. In the conference tournament semi-finals, the Lobos won at No. 20 UNLV, with Snell accounting for 15 points, six rebounds, and six assists. The Lobos won the championship game over number 18 San Diego State, as Snell scored 14, shooting 4-6 from three, and was named to the All-Tournament team. New Mexico received a five-seed in the NCAA tournament, but Snell was a non-factor, shooting a combined 1-9 (1-8 from three) and scoring just three points as the Lobos beat Long Beach State then lost to Final Four-bound Louisville. The Lobos finished the season 28–7, and Snell was named Honorable Mention All-Mountain West.\n2012–13 season: Junior year.\nThe 2012-13 Lobos again relied on tough defense and a balanced scoring attack, often coming from behind to grind out close wins. The team held opponents to sixty points a game and again held them under 40% shooting, while going 10–2 in games decided by six or fewer points. While Williams led the team at just 13.3 points a game, four players averaged in double-figures, and seven Lobo players led the team in scoring in individual games. Snell led the team in ten games, including five straight during a late stretch when he averaged 19.8 a game and shot 22-39 (.564) from three-point range. On the season, Snell averaged 12.5 points, 2.6 rebounds, and 2.9 assists a game, and he led the team in three-point shooting percentage and, for the second straight season, free throw percentage. Over his career, he was the fifth most accurate free throw shooter in Lobo history.\nThe Lobos began the season 12–0, including a win over number 19 Connecticut, and climbed to No. 16 in the polls. They lost a couple of games to eventual NCAA tournament teams South Dakota State and St. Louis, but also won at No. 8 Cincinnati. After a bad loss at No. 20 San Diego State, they won nine out of ten and clinched the MWC regular season title, while reaching No. 11. Snell assumed more of a leadership role, an adjustment due to his quiet demeanor — his mother termed him the \"silent assassin,\" a nickname that Lobo fans embraced. He scored 20 points or more in six games, 25 or more in three games, but he continued to struggle at times, scoring under ten points in 13 games, with a low of five. In the MWC tournament, Snell averaged 17.7 points a game while shooting 12-20 (.600) from three-point range. In the semi-final game against San Diego State, he made three three-pointers in 55 seconds as the Lobos built a large lead. In the championship game at UNLV, he shot 8-11 from the field, 5-7 from three, at one point scoring 13 straight points for the Lobos as they pulled away to seal their second straight tourney title. Snell was named tournament MVP and ESPN national player of the week for his performance. After the season, he was named Third Team All-MWC. New Mexico entered the NCAA tournament ranked No. 10 and received a three-seed. They suffered a disappointing upset to Harvard, however, to finish the season 29–6. The Lobos shot poorly, with Snell going 4–12, 1-6 from three, for just nine points.\nSnell chose to forgo his senior season and declared for the NBA draft. While his college numbers were not spectacular, NBA scouts noted that the Lobos' balanced offense limited his output, and they were impressed by his length, outside shooting, and greatly improved defense.\nProfessional career.\nChicago Bulls (2013–2016).\nSnell was selected with the 20th overall pick in 2013 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls. On July 10, 2013, he signed with the Bulls and joined them for 2013 NBA Summer League, where he averaged 11.8 points, 6.6 rebounds, 2.2 assists and 1.2 steals in five games. As a rookie in 2013–14, Snell appeared in 77 games for the Bulls, averaging 4.5 points and 1.6 rebounds per game.\nIn July 2014, Snell re-joined the Bulls for the 2014 NBA Summer League, where he averaged 20.0 points, 4.0 rebounds and 2.8 assists in five games, earning All-NBA Summer League first team honors. He was reunited with former Lobo teammates Bairstow (2014 Bulls' draftee) and Williams on the Bulls' summer league squad. On February 10, 2015, he scored a career-high 24 points in the Bulls' 104–86 win over the Sacramento Kings.\nSnell became the Bulls' starting small forward to begin the 2015–16 season. Over the first 25 games of the season, Snell started in all but four. However, on December 21, he was removed from the team's regular rotation and over the next three games, he was credited with a \"DNP\" in two of the three. With teammate Doug McDermott out injured on December 28 against the Toronto Raptors, Snell got his chance to re-establish himself in the rotation, coming off the bench to score an equal team-high 22 points on 8-of-14 shooting in 27 minutes of action, helping the Bulls defeat the Raptors 104–97.\nMilwaukee Bucks (2016–2019).\nOn October 17, 2016, Snell was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in exchange for Michael Carter-Williams. After missing the Bucks' season opener with a sprained left ankle, Snell made his debut for the team in their second game of the season on October 29, 2016, scoring six points in 21 minutes as a starter in a 110–108 win over the Brooklyn Nets. On December 26, 2016, he made a career-high six three-pointers and set a season high with 20 points in a 107–102 loss to the Washington Wizards. On February 24, 2017, in 28 minutes of play against the Utah Jazz, Snell recorded zero counting stats, falling just 22 seconds short of Joel Anthony’s record for most playing time in a game without recording a point, rebound, assist, steal or block. On March 6, 2017, he had 18 of his season-high 21 in the first half of the Bucks' 112–98 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. He surpassed that mark on March 28 with a career-high 26 points in a 118–108 win over the Charlotte Hornets. On April 22, 2017, he set playoff career highs with 19 points and five 3-pointers in an 87–76 loss to the Toronto Raptors in Game 4 of their first-round playoff series; the loss tied the series at 2–2.\nOn July 31, 2017, Snell re-signed with the Bucks to a four-year, $44 million contract. The deal reportedly includes a player option after the third year and reachable incentives that would push his total earnings to $46 million. On March 23, 2018, he matched his season high with 18 points in a 118–105 win over the Chicago Bulls.\nDetroit Pistons (2019–2020).\nOn June 20, 2019, Snell was traded, along with the draft rights to Kevin Porter Jr., to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for Jon Leuer.\nAtlanta Hawks (2020–2021).\nOn November 20, 2020, Snell and Khyri Thomas were traded to the Atlanta Hawks in exchange for Dewayne Dedmon. On March 11, 2021, Snell made a game winning three-pointer at the buzzer to give the Hawks a 121–120 victory over the Toronto Raptors, capping off a 15-point fourth quarter comeback.\nPortland Trail Blazers (2021–2022).\nOn August 10, 2021, the Portland Trail Blazers announced that they had signed Snell.\nNew Orleans Pelicans (2022).\nOn February 8, 2022, Portland traded Snell, Larry Nance Jr. and CJ McCollum to the New Orleans Pelicans in exchange for Josh Hart, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Tomáš Satoranský, Didi Louzada, a protected 2022 first-round draft pick, the better of New Orleans' and Portland's 2026 second-round draft picks and New Orleans' 2027 second-round draft pick.\nMaine Celtics (2023–present).\nOn January 27, 2023, Snell was acquired by the Maine Celtics.\nOn August 8, 2023, the Golden State Warriors held a free agent workout with Snell. On October 29, he returned to Maine.\nPersonal life.\nSnell met his wife, Ashley, at a barbecue hosted by his Chicago Bulls teammate Jimmy Butler. They have two sons who were both diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.\nOn June 16, 2023, on \"The Today Show\", Snell revealed that he was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, after the evaluation of his eldest son helped to realize similarities with his own experience."

Northern Irish players normally compete for Ireland, but are also eligible to compete for the GB.\nThe three home nations associations—Basketball England, basketballscotland and Basketball Wales—still have responsibility for basketball in their own countries, including organising competitions and developing the sport.\nHistory.\nThe British &amp; Irish Basketball Federation (BIBF) was formed in 1960 from funding from the Sports Council. Northern Ireland began to be represented by Basketball Ireland, and in 2004 Ireland left the BIBF.\nIn October 2004 the BIBF changed its name to Great Britain Basketball.\nIn December 2006 the British Basketball Federation (BBF) was formed, and GB teams replaced England in the U20 and senior age groups in FIBA competitions. In order for GB teams to compete in the London Olympics in 2012, FIBA had insisted that a single governing body for Great Britain be formed, rather than the existing three separate home nations. England, Scotland and Wales continued to compete separately in youth competitions.\nBasketball Wales rejected a full merger in 2012, so the new governing body was initially formed by just England Basketball (now Basketball England) and basketballscotland. Wales eventually agreed to join the new federation in 2015. The merger was formally completed in October 2016, and the home nations gave up their individual memberships of FIBA. Great Britain national teams now compete in all age groups from U16 to senior, with Scotland and Wales still able to field separate teams in some lower division youth competitions.\nThe federation is based in the offices of UK Sport."

That left two teams, KSF Copenhagen and Rungsted IK, left to play in the finals. The final was held on a frozen-over tennis court in Hørsholm.

        "title": "W. G. Grace's cricket career (1879 to 1882)",
        "text": "W. G. Grace qualified as a doctor in 1879 made his first appearance in Test cricket the following year, scoring the first-ever century by an England batsman.\n1879 English cricket season.\nGrace missed a large part of the 1879 season because he was doing the final practical for his medical qualification and, for the first time since 1869, he did not complete 1000 runs, though he did take 105 wickets.\nGrace made 18 first-class appearances in 1879, scoring 993 runs, with a highest score of 123, at an average of 38.19 with 3 centuries and 5 half-centuries. In the field, he took 23 catches and 113 wickets with a best analysis of 8–81. His bowling average was 13.19; he had 5 wickets in an innings 14 times and 10 wickets in a match once.\nHaving qualified as a doctor in November 1879, Grace had to give priority to his new practice in Bristol for the next five years. As a result, his cricket sometimes had to be set aside and he had other troubles including a serious bout of mumps in 1882. From 1879 to 1882, he did not complete 1000 runs in the season.\n1880 English cricket season.\nIn addition, Gloucestershire had declined following its heady success in the 1870s. One of the reasons was the early death of W.G.'s younger brother Fred from pneumonia in 1880, there being a view that \"the county was never quite the same without him\". Apart from W.G. himself, the only players of Fred Grace's calibre at this time were the leading professionals. Unlike the south-east and northern counties, Gloucestershire had neither the large home gates nor the necessary funds that could have secured the services of good quality professionals. This was at a time when a new generation of professionals was appearing with the likes of Billy Gunn, Maurice Read and Arthur Shrewsbury. As a result, Gloucestershire fell away in county competition and could no longer match Nottinghamshire, Surrey and Lancashire who had the strongest sides in the 1880s.\nTest cricket began in 1877 when Grace was already 28 and he made his debut in 1880, scoring England's first-ever Test century against Australia. He played for England in 22 Tests through the 1880s and 1890s, all of them against Australia, and was an automatic selection for England at home, but his only Test-playing tour of Australia was that of 1891–92.\nGrace made 16 first-class appearances in 1880, scoring 951 runs, with a highest score of 152, at an average of 39.62 with 2 centuries and 5 half-centuries. In the field, he took 17 catches and 84 wickets with a best analysis of 7–65. His bowling average was 17.60; he had 5 wickets in an innings 9 times and 10 wickets in a match 3 times.\n1881 English cricket season.\nGrace made 13 first-class appearances in 1881, scoring 917 runs, with a highest score of 182, at an average of 38.20 with 2 centuries and 5 half-centuries. In the field, he took 20 catches and 57 wickets with a best analysis of 7–30. His bowling average was 18.00; he had 5 wickets in an innings 3 times.\n1882 English cricket season.\nGrace's most significant Test was England v Australia in 1882 at The Oval. Thanks to Spofforth who took 14 wickets in the match, Australia won by 7 runs and the legend of The Ashes was born immediately afterwards. Grace scored only 4 and 32 but he has been held responsible for \"firing up\" Spofforth. This came about through a typical piece of gamesmanship by Grace when he effected an unsporting, albeit legal, run out of Sammy Jones.\nGrace made 22 first-class appearances in 1882, scoring 975 runs, with a highest score of 88, at an average of 26.35 with 0 centuries and 8 half-centuries. In the field, he took 22 catches and 101 wickets with a best analysis of 8–31. His bowling average was 17.34; he had 5 wickets in an innings 8 times and 10 wickets in a match twice."

        "text": "Joseph Morgan (born March 23, 1988) is a former American football wide receiver. He played college football at Illinois and Walsh and was signed by the Saints as an undrafted free agent in 2011.\nProfessional career.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nMorgan was signed as an undrafted free agent by the New Orleans Saints on July 27, 2011. Little known at the beginning of training camp, he became a focus of attention after he scored touchdowns in consecutive preseason games, and was considered a strong candidate to make the regular season roster until he suffered a knee injury. He was placed on injured reserve on September 3, 2011.\nIn 2012 Morgan made the roster as a backup receiver. During the first three games of the season, he had only one catch and little impact, but in the Saints' fourth game, at Green Bay, he caught an 80-yard touchdown pass from Drew Brees for his first NFL touchdown and the team's longest play of the season so far. In the Saints' sixth game at Tampa Bay, he made another spectacular scoring play: after catching a long pass from Brees inside the 10 yard line, he evaded Mark Barron's tackle and managed to stay off the ground, regained his balance and flipped Eric Wright over his head as he stood up, and finally dashed into the end zone before taking a hard hit from Cody Grimm to score what a \"USA Today\" writer called \"one of the great scoring efforts of the season\".\nOn August 7, 2013, the New Orleans Saints announced that Morgan suffered a torn meniscus and a partially torn ACL during training camp practice and will miss the entire 2013 season. On August 27, 2013, the Saints placed Morgan on injured reserve. On October 26, 2014, head coach Sean Payton announced that Morgan was suspended, for reasons which were not given by him. On December 9, 2014, Joe Morgan was waived by the New Orleans Saints.\nMorgan rejoined the Saints on April 2, 2015. He was released on September 5 for final roster cuts before the start of the season. On September 16, he re-signed with the team. On October 24, 2015, he was released by the Saints.\nBaltimore Ravens.\nMorgan signed with the Baltimore Ravens on November 4 after placing wide receiver Steve Smith, Sr. on season ending injured reserve. He was subsequently waived on November 23 without having appeared in a game for the Ravens.\nToronto Argonauts.\nOn October 5, 2016, Morgan signed a practice roster agreement with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League. After spending a month on the Argonauts' practice roster until the end of the season, Morgan re-signed with the Argonauts on December 15, 2016. After playing in the preseason games Joseph was released before week 1 of the 2017 season.\nSaskatchewan Roughriders\nOn July 3, 2017, Morgan signed a practice roster agreement with Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League."

        "title": "Survivor Series (2012)",
        "text": "The 2012 Survivor Series was the 26th annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by WWE. It took place on November 18, 2012, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Indiana, which was the first Survivor Series held in Indiana. The event received 212,000 pay-per-view buys, down from 281,000 buys the previous year.\nThe event was originally planned to be held at the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but the WWE relocated the event to Indianapolis as it was conflicted with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens \"Sunday Night Football\" game of the 2012 NFL season. The WWE would later give Pittsburgh its infamous and controversial Royal Rumble pay-per-view event that was held in 2014.\nSeven matches took place at the event, including one on the pre-show. In the main event, CM Punk defeated John Cena and Ryback to retain the WWE Championship. In other prominent matches, Eve Torres retained the Divas Championship against Kaitlyn, and Antonio Cesaro retained the United States Championship against R-Truth.\nThe event is notable for the onscreen main roster debut of Dean Ambrose, Roman Reigns, and Seth Rollins, who would collectively be known as The Shield.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every November by WWE since 1987. The second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, referred to as the \"Big Four\". The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. The 2012 event was the 26th Survivor Series and was scheduled to be held on November 18, 2012.\nThe 2012 event was originally scheduled to be held at the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. However, this booking inadvertently conflicted with the National Football League's schedule for the 2012 season, which pitted the Pittsburgh Steelers against the Baltimore Ravens in a home game that same night. Despite Pittsburgh being a strong WWE market dating from the territorial days of professional wrestling, WWE decided to make no attempts to locally compete against the fanbase of the Steelers (especially since the game was against the team's archrival) and moved Survivor Series to the Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Indiana, marking the first Survivor Series held in the state. WWE compensated Pittsburgh by having a double \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\" taping in December, before giving the city a \"Big Four\" pay-per-view with the now-infamous 2014 Royal Rumble.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised seven matches, including one on the pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermine by WWE's writers, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\".\nOn the October 29 episode of \"Raw\", a Survivor Series elimination match between a team managed by Mick Foley, and a team led by CM Punk was scheduled. Originally Punk captained the team which also included The Miz, Cody Rhodes, Damien Sandow, and Alberto Del Rio, whereas Foley's team was to consist of Ryback, Kofi Kingston, Kane, Daniel Bryan, and Randy Orton. The team members were involved in many feuds: Hell in a Cell, Team Rhodes Scholars (Rhodes and Sandow) had unsuccessfully challenged Team Hell No (Kane and Daniel Bryan) for the Tag Team Championship and The Miz had failed to win the Intercontinental Championship from Kingston. Del Rio had also lost to Orton at the event. However, the main feud was between the WWE Champion CM Punk and Ryback. Ryback had lost a title match at Hell in a Cell after the referee Brad Maddox low-blowed him, before a fast count to give Punk the pinfall victory. Ryback then took out his frustration on Punk and Maddox, first press-slamming Maddox out of the ring into the side of the cell, then chasing Punk to the top of the cell, where Ryback caught him and performed his finishing move, Shell Shocked. There were many changes: on the November 5 episode of \"Raw\", The Miz quit the team due to Punk abandoning his team in an attack by Team Foley and was replaced by Wade Barrett, who Paul Heyman had recruited. Furthermore, WWE Chairman Vince McMahon questioned Vickie Guerrero's decision to place Punk in an elimination match instead of letting him defend his title, and forced Vickie Guerrero to remove Punk and Ryback from the elimination match. Dolph Ziggler replaced Punk as captain of the team, which was now renamed Team Ziggler. Ryback's replacement was to be chosen by a Raw active poll, with the choices The Miz, Santino Marella, and Zack Ryder being candidates. Rhodes was replaced by David Otunga at the event due to an injury sustained in the lead-up to the event.\nInstead of competing in the Survivor Series elimination match, CM Punk was scheduled to defend his WWE Championship in a triple threat match against Ryback and John Cena, whom Punk had wrestled to a draw at Night of Champions.\nSurvivor Series also included a rematch from Hell in a Cell between Sheamus and Big Show for the World Heavyweight Championship.\nAt Night of Champions, Kaitlyn was attacked by an unknown woman moments before she was set to face off against Layla for the WWE Divas Championship, which led to Eve Torres replacing Kaitlyn and winning the title. In the weeks that followed, the evil Aksana was eventually revealed as Kaitlyn's attacker, doing so under Eve's orders. As a result, a Triple Threat Match took place at Hell In A Cell, with Eve defeating Layla and Kaitlyn to retain the title. On the November 12 episode of \"Raw\", Kaitlyn defeated Layla to earn a Divas Championship match at Survivor Series.\nJustin Gabriel and Tyson Kidd were initially scheduled to face 3MB (Heath Slater and Jinder Mahal, with Drew McIntyre) in the pre-show available free on YouTube, but were replaced with Team Co-Bro (Santino Marella and Zack Ryder) due to being placed in a different match at the event.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nOn the pre-show, 3MB (Heath Slater and Jinder Mahal, with Drew McIntyre) faced Team CoBro (Santino Marella and Zack Ryder). Though Ryder was able to execute the Broski Boot and Rough Ryder on Slater, he missed the tag made by Mahal who pinned Ryder resulting in a victory for 3MB.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe main show opened with an unannounced Survivor Series elimination match between the team of Brodus Clay, Tyson Kidd, Justin Gabriel, Rey Mysterio, and Sin Cara and the team of Tensai, Primo &amp; Epico, and The Prime Time Players (Darren Young and Titus O'Neil). Clay was eliminated by Tensai after a Gomennasai. Tensai was eliminated by Gabriel with a Crucifix Pin. O'Neil was eliminated by Kidd with a Roll Up. Epico was eliminated by Kidd after submitting to the Sharpshooter. Primo was eliminated by Mysterio with La Magistral. Young was eliminated by Mysterio after a 619 followed by a Diving Splash, leaving Kidd, Gabriel, Mysterio and Sin Cara as the survivors.\nNext, Eve defended the Divas Championship against Kaitlyn. Eve pinned Kaitlyn after the Heart Breaker to win the match.\nIn the third match, Antonio Cesaro defended the United States Championship against R-Truth. Cesaro pinned R-Truth after a Neutralizer to win the match.\nMain event matches.\nIn the next match, World Heavyweight Champion Big Show was challenged by former champion, Sheamus. The match ended when Big Show intentionally used the referee as a shield, causing Sheamus to inadvertently performed a Brogue Kick on the referee. With Sheamus distracted and attending to the official, Big Show performed the Knockout Punch on Sheamus, after which another referee counted the fall and awarded Big Show the victory. The referee reversed the decision and disqualified Big Show, who nevertheless retained the title. After the match, Big Show argued with the referee John Cone, before Sheamus assaulted Big Show with a chair, and setting up a rematch at next month's pay-per-view.\nThe fifth match was a Survivor Series match between Team Foley (Randy Orton, The Miz, Kane, Daniel Bryan, and Kofi Kingston, with Mick Foley at ringside) and Team Ziggler (Dolph Ziggler, Wade Barrett, Alberto Del Rio, Damien Sandow, and David Otunga). Sandow was eliminated by Kane after a Chokeslam. Kane was eliminated by Ziggler after a Zig Zag. Otunga was eliminated by Bryan after submitting to the No Lock. Kingston was eliminated by Barrett after a Bull Hammer. Bryan was eliminated by Del Rio after submitting to the Cross Armbreaker. Barrett was eliminated by The Miz after a Skull Crushing Finale. The Miz was eliminated by Del Rio after a Step Up Enziguri on the Top Rope. Del Rio was eliminated by Orton after an RKO. After Orton kicked out of a Zig Zag, Orton attempted to perform a Punt Kick on Ziggler but Ziggler performed a Superkick on Orton to eliminate him, leaving Ziggler as the sole survivor.\nThe main event of the night was a triple threat match for the WWE Championship between reigning champion CM Punk and challengers Ryback and John Cena. The match came to an end when the debuting trio of Seth Rollins, Dean Ambrose, and Roman Reigns - later known as The Shield - approached the ring from the crowd and triple-powerbombed Ryback through the broadcast table, allowing Punk to retain the title by pinning Cena, who had received a Shell Shock from Ryback. As a result, Punk became only the seventh wrestler in history to hold the WWE Championship consecutively for one full year."

An Australian international and Queensland interstate representative forward, he played club football throughout the state of Queensland during his career. He retired with the record for most games for North Queensland, having captained the side to victories over Great Britain and France.\nBiography.\nPaterson was born in Townsville in 1934. He attended South Townsville State School and became a South Townsville rugby league club junior.\nPlaying career.\nPaterson made his first appearance for the South Townsville club's senior team in 1953. He represented Townsville in the Foley Shield competition. Whilst playing for Rockhampton in 1954 Paterson first represented North Queensland. Paterson moved to Toowoomba club Valleys where he was coached by former Kangaroo forward Herb Steinohrt. During this time he represented Toowoomba for two seasons.\nAfter returning to Townsville in 1958 to captain-coach Souths, Paterson again played for North Queensland and was first selected for the Queensland Maroons, playing against arch-rivals New South Wales. The following year, he helped the Maroons to win the interstate series against New South Wales for the first time. Paterson was then selected for the Australian national team, becoming Kangaroo No. 343. and playing in all three Test matches in the series against New Zealand. At the end of the year he was selected to go on the 1959-60 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France. He played two Tests against France.\nIn 1960 Paterson joined Innisfail, who he captain-coached to victory in the Foley Shield and Paterson played for North Queensland, Queensland and Australia. The Test in Sydney against France featured five Queenslanders in the forward pack. The following year Paterson toured New Zealand with the Australian team, playing in both Tests against the Kiwis. This was after the Queensland team, of which he was now a fixture, retained the interstate crown against New South Wales. Paterson spent a third year in Innisfail but, instead of playing with all the clubs, he joined the Babinda Colts as coach. In 1963 the Herbert River coaching position lured Paterson to Ingham. Once again he represented North Queensland, including the match against New Zealand, and again went on to play for Queensland against the Blues. He returned to Townsville to coach Centrals and the Foley Shield team in 1964, taking his team to the Shield final. Paterson continued to play for North Queensland and Queensland until 1966 when he was again a member of Townsville's Foley Shield final team before retiring.\nPost playing.\nIn 2008, Australian rugby league's centenary year, Paterson was named at second-row forward in a Queensland Rugby League Northern Division 'Team of the Century'."

        "text": "Ding Hui () is a Chinese professional volleyball player currently playing for Shanghai Men's Volleyball Club. Ding was the first Chinese athlete of African descent to be selected for a Chinese national sports team.\nDing's selection to the team garnered widespread media attention, with some commentators saying he 'redefined race in China.' The coach of the national team, Zhou Jianan, was irritated by the number of calls he received inquiring Ding's family background. Zhou dismissed most of these calls, saying that he \"fits the requirements established by the Chinese Volleyball Association\" and that Ding's background is a \"private matter.\" He prepared to play at the 2012 London Olympics but ultimately was cut from the team.\nIn his personal life, Ding is \"also a great singer and dancer and he brings more passion to the game than the other players,\" said Wang Hebing, the head coach of Zhejiang Volleyball team.\nIn 2012, Ding left Zhejiang men's volleyball team and went to study abroad before the new season started because \"there's no future of this sport in China.\" He returned to China for some training, then returned to the U.S. He acted as a part-time volleyball coach.\nDing began playing volleyball for Warner University in 2014."

        "title": "Sailing Soul(s)",
        "text": "Sailing Soul(s) is the debut mixtape by American singer-songwriter Jhené Aiko; it was released on March 16, 2011, her 23rd birthday, &amp; re-released for streaming platforms on March 12, 2021. Aiko began working on the mixtape after she gave birth to her daughter. Aiko wrote all the mixtape's songs except \"July,\" which was written by Micah Powell. Most songs on the mixtape were produced by Fisticuffs, except “July” and “You vs Them” which were produced by Bei Maejor, “Real Now” which was produced by Roosevelt, “Do Better” which was produced by J. Lbs and “Growing Apart” which was produced by Tae Beast. The mixtape featured several guest vocalists, including Miguel, Drake, Gucci Mane, and Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar as well as others.\nCritically the mixtape received positive reviews, with reviewers saying that the mixtape was one of the \"freshest\", another reviewer said that the mixtape is making \"Noise in the R&amp;B spectrum\". The concept follows the story of Aiko having a meeting with a label and she was told by people at the label \"I love everything but when you come into these meetings you have to sell yourself.\" After the meeting Jhene came up with the concept \"I’m not a slave to anyone; I’m sailing my soul instead of selling it.\"\nTo promote the mixtape Aiko was joined by Grammy-nominated R&amp;B singer Miguel on a one off free secret tour on Sunday, July 15. The free tickets were given away at the Key Club box office on July 6 from 11AM-5PM on a first-come, first-served basis while. The concert started 7:00pm and finished at 9:30pm, lasting a duration of two and a half hours. On October 21, 2012 Aiko released a music video for the song \"My Mine\". Jhene also released a video for the mixtapes second track \"Stranger\". Datpiff certified the mixtape Platinum with downloads of 300,000 and an additional 31,000 downloads from MixtapeMonkey.com.\nBackground and concept.\nIn 2002, Jhené made her musical beginning when she featured on several B2K songs from their album . \nShe released a video for her single \"NO L.O.V.E\" which debuted on BET 106 &amp; Park when she was 15 years old. Jhene was set to release her self-titled debut album but the album was never released due to tension at the record label Epic, in which Aiko asked to be released from the label. Aiko then began to focus on school. Later at the age of 20, Aiko became pregnant by American R&amp;B singer O'Ryan and gave birth to a baby girl named Namiko Love Browner on 19 November 2008.\nSix months after Aiko gave birth to her daughter she began to work on the mixtape. This period of Aiko's life was turbulent with the singer stating \"At the time I was going through so much in my life that it was so easy to write the songs. I had just had a baby and I was dealing with baby father issues and I had a boyfriend. The songs were just coming and coming. I just had so much to say, and when I was signed, I never really got a chance to write my own music. I always wanted to do a mixtape and before I got pregnant I was about to get back into it ‘cause I was working with different producers and things like that. Fisticuffs, who produced the majority of sailing soul(s), I’ve known them for a while and worked with them on different projects. So yeah, the concepts were just coming and it only took about nine months to complete\".\nAll the songs on the mixtape were written by Aiko, except “July” which was written by Micah Powell and most of the songs were produced by Fisticuffs, except “July” and “You vs Them” which were produced by Bei Maejor, “Real Now” which was produced by Roosevelt, “Do Better” which was produced by J. Lbs and “Growing Apart” which was produced by Tae Beast. The album's artwork was shot by photographer Jay 3. The mixtape also features collaborations from Miguel, Drake and Kanye West as well as others. In 2011, she also began working closely with artists from Carson-based independent record label Top Dawg Entertainment.\nThe mixtape's concept and title was based on a meeting, Aiko had with a label head, shortly before she found out she was pregnant. Aiko's voice was praised, but was told during the meeting she needed to \"sell yourself\". Jhené tweeted the word \"sailing souls\" on twitter in a mishap, however the name stuck. Explaining the mixtape's title during an interview with \"Vibe Magazine\", Jhené says \"it just means to stay true to yourself and go with what you feel. Don’t ever lose yourself for whatever reason—because you want to make more money, because you want to be prettier or whatever. I’m not a slave to anyone; I’m sailing my soul instead of selling it.\"\nMusic and lyrics.\nIn an interview Aiko described the music and her style on the mixtape, saying \"Honestly, I don't think it fits in and I think that's why it stands out. It's about what I'm saying. It's a marriage [with] real music. Fisticuffs, they don't use any samples and they use live instruments a lot of the times in their beats, so I would go in there and I would be singing and they would be making the track. It was like a complete marriage of sound. I wouldn't write anything down, just sing it on the mic and come up with everything off the top of my head. I feel like it doesn't have to sound like anything that's on the radio to be good music\".\n\"Sailing Soul(s)\" opening track last for a duration of eight-second which features a \"sped up, reversed intro\", that then is followed by the album's second song \"Stranger\", which lyrically talks of a \"woman going through similar issues of the heart, but seemingly with different men\".\n\"Hoe\" is produced by Fisticuffs, and features a \"steady drum beat\", the song also includes guest vocals from Miguel and Gucci Mane. The fourth track \"July\", features vocals from rapper Drake, which has \"a lighter feel on production and a simple, repetitive piano chord\". “My Mine,” used the topic Cannabis as metaphor for love.\n\"Sailing Not Selling\", featuring a verse from Kanye West, lyrically the song \"attack a hot topic in music right now\". \"Do Better Blues\", which was produced by J.LBS talks about \"the fearful truth to an ex, saying she is probably NOT better off without him\". “Higher” is described as a crazy, \"sexy, cool song\" with suggestive lyrics in regards to Cannabis, “Break me down/Roll me up/Boy I can be your pipe dream”. “You vs. Them,” is described as \"hauntingly beautiful song\", that lyrically describes \"the apprehension of getting into a relationship, of which, she may be referring to a person or God\". \"Space Jam\" Aiko wrote on the subject of when she found out her brother had been diagnosed with cancer.\nTrack listing.\nNotes\nSampling credits"

        "text": "The United States women's cricket team is the team that represents the country of the United States in international women's cricket matches. Although the United States has been an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1965, the team made its international debut in 2009. The United States is one of the leading associate teams in the ICC Americas region and has participated in two editions of the Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier and two editions of the ICC Women's T20 World Cup Qualifier, although it is yet to qualify for any World Cups.\nHistory.\nA national women's program was initiated in 2008. The U.S. women's team made its international debut against Brazil at the 2009 Americas Women's Championship, which it hosted in Fort Lauderdale; former West Indies international Roselyn Emmanuel was the team's inaugural captain. In 2010, the team defeated Canada in a three-match series to represent the Americas region at the 2011 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier. The team finished fourth in its group at the Qualifier with only one win – a one-run victory against Zimbabwe. \nThe early years of the women's national team were marked by conflict with the sport's governing body, the United States of America Cricket Association (USACA). In the lead-up to the 2011 World Cup Qualifier, it was reported that USACA had been reprimanded by the ICC over its lack of support for the women's team and failure to meet administrative deadlines for the tournament. Thirteen players also threatened to withdraw from the national squad over gender inequality in tour stipends. In 2012, it was reported that the team's national coach Robin Singh had made sexist remarks disparaging the players' ability and stating that he had had to \"drop [his] mental standards\" in order to coach them. USACA failed to hold any national women's events from 2011 to 2016, when the ICC intervened to establish a national combine.\nIn April 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) granted full Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between the United States women and another international side after July 1, 2018 will be a full WT20I.\nIn March 2019, Julia Price was appointed as the head coach of the team. Price had previously played international cricket for Australia. Price stepped down from the role in May 2022, and was succeeded by Shivnarine Chanderpaul in July 2022 as women's senior and U-19 coach.\nIn December 2020, the ICC announced the qualification pathway for the 2023 ICC Women's T20 World Cup. The United States were named in the 2021 ICC Women's T20 World Cup Americas Qualifier regional group, alongside three other teams.\nIn May 2022, the ICC announced the United States as one of five women's sides to gain Women's One Day International (ODI) status. Netherlands, Papua New Guinea, Scotland and Thailand are the other four teams.\nRecords and statistics.\nInternational Match Summary — United States Women\n\"Last updated May 1, 2024\"\nOne-Day International.\nODI record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to WODI #1379.

        "text": "The Intercontinental Derby (), also known as the Eternal Rivalry (Turkish: ), is the name given to any basketball match between Fenerbahçe SK and Galatasaray SK, teams of the Asian and the European parts of Istanbul respectively. Fenerbahçe is the most successful of the two clubs, having won more overall trophies in past seasons (including the highest level tier of European basketball, the EuroLeague trophy, where the winners are considered the biggest team of Europe) and derby games.\nHistory.\nAccording to the official records, in Turkey, basketball was first played in 1904 at Robert College. An American physical education teacher laid the foundations of this sport in Turkey. Seven years later, in 1911, Ahmet Robenson, a physical education teacher at a high school, decided to introduce a new game to the students. Robenson popularized this sport in Turkey.\nGalatasaray are considered to be the pioneers in Turkish basketball, and the sport has always been very important for the club. The team have won 11 national championship titles and 15 Istanbul League titles. Former president of the club, Özhan Canaydın, was a former player of the basketball team.\nThe men's basketball department of Fenerbahçe was founded in 1913 and achieved considerable success when the sport established itself in Turkey. Fenerbahçe have won seven Istanbul League titles and three national championship titles in 1957, 1959 and 1965, just before the professional nationwide league was founded in 1966, and participated in the European Champions Cup in 1960 and 1966. Their fans had to wait until 1991 for another title, when Levent Topsakal, Larry Richard, and head coach Çetin Yılmaz led Fenerbahçe to the Turkish League title over Tofaş.\nBasketball rivalry.\nFenerbahçe consider themselves as the pioneers of basketball in Turkey, boasting their success in winning more trophies, including the 2016–17 EuroLeague title, which is marked as the first ever EuroLeague title won by a Turkish basketball club.\nCulture.\nThe clubs originate from two different sides of the Bosphorus. Fenerbahçe SK were founded in Kadıköy that is located on the Asian side of Istanbul, while Galatasaray SK were founded in the Beyoğlu district, on the European side of Istanbul. Both clubs naturally draw the majority of their support from the side of the city that they are native to, but maintain a significant majority of support drawn from the rest of Turkey."

        "title": "British Gymnastics",
        "text": "British Gymnastics (BG), officially the British Amateur Gymnastics Association (formerly abbreviated BAGA), is the sports governing body for competitive amateur gymnastics and trampolining in the United Kingdom.\nHistory.\nIt was founded in 1888 as the Amateur Gymnastics and Fencing Association. Gymnastics had been adopted in this country, having been invented in Germany by Friedrich Ludwig Jahn, to improve the health and fitness of its soldiers. The rings, pommel horse, parallel bars, and horizontal bar were developed by Jahn. In the late 1800s gymnastics became popular for men thanks to the Army Physical Training Corps which was formed in 1860. Walter Tysall won the men's silver medal in the 1908 Olympics. After this time the Swedish form of gymnastics became more popular, a more artistic version developed by Pehr Henrik Ling which was for men and women, and needed little apparatus.\nWomen first competed at the Olympics in gymnastics at the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam, where the British women's team took the bronze – its best performance.\nAfter the Second World War, the German and Swedish forms of gymnastics were combined. The 1960 Summer Olympics were the first to be televised, and this led to a greater interest in Britain of gymnastics. This Olympics had been dominated by Russian female gymnasts. In 1963 the Amateur Gymnastics Association became the British Amateur Gymnastics Association, and the BAGA first received a government grant, allowing it to pay coaches, and appoint a full-time national coach, Nik Stuart. He developed the BAGA Awards, a proficiency scheme for young gymnasts, which was adopted by seventy other countries.\nThe BAGA Awards started to produce results for Britain. Gymnastics were given superstar status by the 1972 Olympics at Munich.\nAt the 2008 Beijing Olympics, an individual Bronze for Louis Smith was a breakthrough with the first medal in decades.\nAt the 2012 London Olympics, the Men's Artistic Gymnastics team won Bronze with individual Silver for Louis Smith and Bronze for Max Whitlock on Pommel and individual Bronze for Beth Tweddle on Uneven bars.\nBAGA was registered as a company on 20 April 1982. In 1979 the Sports Council had built a gym at Lilleshall, equipped to international standards in 1980, with the Queen Elizabeth Hall. In 1981 a £18,000 feasibility study looked at developing Lilleshall into a national centre, and in October 1982 the Sports Council allocated £1 million to develop a national centre.\nAnne, Princess Royal opened the £1.75 million Princess Royal Hall at Lilleshall on 26 April 1988, paid for by the Sports Council. There is also the King George VI Hall and Ford Hall. Use of Lilleshall for gymnastics increased greatly throughout the late 1970s under Derek Tremayne. In 1997 BAGA became British Gymnastics.\nFunction.\nIt is the main sport governing body for gymnastics throughout the UK, developing gymnasts, coaches clubs and officiating in all gymnastic disciplines.\nBritish Gymnastics aimed to meet the following aspirations by 2021:\nThe strategic priorities of the 2017-2021 plan were as follows: \nPublications.\nIts main publication is \"The Gymnast\", having been published since 1959. Since 2011 it has been released in an online format only Most news is now released via the British Gymnastics Website, Social Media and the weekly Gymblast email newsletter"

        "text": "Sarajevo 2010 (Cyrillic: \"Сарајево 2010\") was an unsuccessful bid by Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina to host the 2010 Winter Olympics. It was one of eight candidates, but failed to be short-listed. Sarajevo was the only candidate to previously have hosted the games, having held the 1984 Winter Olympics.\nVenues and infrastructure.\nAlthough the city previously hosted the 1984 Winter Olympics, many of the venues were damaged in the Siege of Sarajevo. The proposal estimated the host costs at US$705 million. The Olympics would be extremely compact, with all venues located within of the city center. Koševo Stadium was proposed as the Olympic Stadium, while Stadion Grbavica was to be used for medal ceremonies. Zetra Ice Rink was proposed rebuilt to host speed skating, while the existing Zetra Ice Hall would be upgraded to host short-track speed skating and figure skating. The existing Skenderija II Hall would be used for ice hockey. The existing sliding center at Trebević was proposed for bobsled, skeleton and luge, while Alpine skiing was proposed at Bjelašnica (men) and Jahorina (women). While the Alpine skiing venues exist, a new snowboarding venue was proposed at Bjelašnica and a freestyle skiing venue at Jahorina.\nEvaluation.\nThe bid was regarded as the poorest by GamesBids, who stated that the attempt was more used to bring hope to the city's people than a realistic bid to host the games. Particularly the region's infrastructure—decimated during the war—does not even hold the same standard as in 1984. GamesBids also cited the country's poverty and questioned the country's ability to fund the games. However, it noted the city's high public support. The International Olympic Committee chose to not shortlist the application."

It is known to have been used as a phrase as early as at least November 1816. It is listed in both the Oxford English Dictionary, and Webster's Dictionary, under the word \"skeleton\". The \"Cambridge Academic Content Dictionary\" lists it under this but also as a separate idiom.

        "text": "Makhtar Vincent N'Diaye (born 12 December 1973) is a Senegalese former professional basketball player who played as a power forward and center. He played for the Vancouver Grizzlies in 1999, becoming the first player from Senegal to join and play in the National Basketball Association (NBA).\nCareer.\nBorn in Diourbel, N'Diaye came to the United States to play high school basketball at Oak Hill Academy in Mouth of Wilson, Virginia. He was recruited to play at Wake Forest by head coach Dave Odom, but was ruled ineligible to play by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) because of recruiting violations and transferred to Michigan. After two seasons, he transferred again, to North Carolina. After sitting out the required one season, N'Diaye played under coaches Dean Smith and Bill Guthridge, making the NCAA Tournament Final Four in 1997 and 1998.\nDuring his NCAA playing career, N'Diaye acquired a reputation for rough play and contentious relations with game officials. In one three-game stretch in February 1998, he was assessed four technical fouls. He attracted national attention for his troublesome attitude during the 1998 Final Four, where he fouled out after only fourteen minutes of play in North Carolina's national semifinal loss to the University of Utah. During the game, he purportedly spat in the face of opposing player Britton Johnsen, and claimed that Johnsen had directed a racial slur at him and denied the spitting incident afterwards. Following a national uproar and vociferous denials of hate speech from both Johnsen and Utah coach Rick Majerus, N'Diaye retracted the accusation and issued a public apology.\nAfter going unselected in the 1998 NBA draft, N'Diaye signed as a free agent with the Vancouver Grizzlies. He played 4 games for Vancouver in the lockout-shortened 1999 season before he was traded to the Orlando Magic, who released him before the 1999–2000 season. He continued his career in Europe, mostly in the French league, save for a season-long stint with the North Charleston Lowgators of the NBA Development League in 2001–02.\nHe represented Senegal at the FIBA World Championship in 1998 and 2006, and played on the team that won the FIBA Africa Championship in 1997."

        "title": "Michigan–Michigan State men's ice hockey rivalry",
        "text": "The Michigan–Michigan State men's ice hockey rivalry is a college ice hockey rivalry between Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey and Michigan State Spartans men's ice hockey that is part of the larger intrastate rivalry between the University of Michigan and Michigan State University. It constitutes the most-played rivalry in college hockey. The rivalry between the Spartans and Wolverines notably includes football and basketball rivalries, although it extends to almost all sports and many other forms of achievement. \nThe most notable examples of the hockey rivalry are two outdoor games, the October 6, 2001 Cold War in East Lansing and the December 11, 2010 Big Chill at the Big House in Ann Arbor, which set the world record for attendance at a hockey game. This record however was broken four years later at the 2014 NHL Winter Classic on January 1, 2014. As of 2013, both teams are members of the Big Ten Conference, although they have previously competed together in both the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) and the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). Michigan went 37–1–1 against Michigan State from 1925 until 1957. \nHistory.\nThe regular home arenas for the teams are Yost Ice Arena (capacity 5,800) and Munn Ice Arena (capacity 6,114). The two schools play at least four times a year through conference play, and with regularity play a fifth game in the Great Lakes Invitational. It is possible for the teams to meet nine times throughout the season with regular season, GLI, Big Ten tournament and NCAA tournament games. The teams often play games on neutral sites and have played at least once per year since 1990 in Detroit, starting at Joe Louis Arena (capacity 20,066). The teams generally alternate years in which they hold a home game in the city. Beginning during the 2015–16 season, the winner of each game at Joe Louis Arena receives the Iron D Trophy. The last contest at Joe Louis Arena was on February 10, 2017, with Little Caesars Arena (capacity 19,515) replacing Joe Louis Arena entirely.\nSince the Little Caesars Arena's hockey configuration capacity exceeds that of all regular collegiate hockey home venues as well as the Beanpot Tournament host venue, TD Garden, the annual game at LCA is among the most attended college hockey games each year, rivaled only by the Frozen Four.\nDuring the 2023–24 season, Michigan and Michigan State faced each other in the NCAA tournament for the first time in the history of the rivalry. Michigan defeated Michigan State 5–2 to advance to their third consecutive Frozen Four.\nAn element of the rivalry is that Michigan (1964, 1992*, 1993* and 2018) and Michigan State (1999 and 2001) are the only two schools to have had both their hockey team and basketball team qualify for the Final Four of the NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship and NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in the same season.\nDuel in the D series.\nMichigan and Michigan State meet once a year in Detroit for a neutral site game. Michigan gets home team designation in even years, while Michigan State gets home team designation in odd years. Michigan leads the Duel in the D series 19–12–5. In 2016, the teams started competing for the Iron D trophy, Michigan has won the trophy five times, while Michigan State has won twice.\nGame results.\nFull game results for the rivalry, with rankings beginning in the 1995–96 season."

        "title": "Michigan–Michigan State men's basketball rivalry",
        "text": "The Michigan–Michigan State basketball rivalry is a college basketball rivalry between Michigan Wolverines men's basketball and Michigan State Spartans men's basketball that is part of the larger intrastate rivalry between the University of Michigan and Michigan State University that exists across a broad spectrum of endeavors including their general athletic programs: Michigan Wolverines and Michigan State Spartans. On the field, the athletic rivalry includes the Paul Bunyan Trophy and the Michigan–Michigan State ice hockey rivalry, but extends to almost all sports and many other forms of achievement. Both teams are members of the Big Ten Conference.\nThe rivalry has been evidenced both on the court and off the court. Among the off the court elements of the rivalry, recruiting of basketball talent has resulted in battles, the most notable of which turned into the University of Michigan basketball scandal, the investigation of which began when both schools sought the services of Mateen Cleaves. Michigan leads the all-time series; however, Michigan State leads the series since joining the Big Ten in 1950.\nSeries history.\nMichigan currently leads the series, which began on January 9, 1909. However, Michigan State currently leads the series since joining the Big Ten in 1950. As a result of the Big Ten moving to 11 teams with the addition of Penn State, teams were not guaranteed two games against each other. Accordingly, the schools chose to play one game that did not count as a conference game in 1997. When the Big Ten went to a 20-game conference schedule in 2018–19, the conference announced that the teams would always play each other twice in each season.\nA 1996 rollover accident during Michigan's recruitment of Mateen Cleaves led to a long investigation surrounding the University of Michigan basketball scandal. Cleaves eventually matriculated at Michigan State.\nDespite the intense rivalry for basketball recruits and resources and the intensity of the rivalry in other sports, the rivalry had not been intense (as measured by rankings) on the basketball court until the 2010s when the teams met 7 times in a row as ranked opponents.\nOn February 12, 2013, for the first time in the series' 170-game history, dating back to 1909, the teams met while both were ranked in the Top 10. The Spartans (20–4, 9–2 Big Ten) were ranked No. 8 in both the AP Top 25 Poll and USA Today Coaches Poll, while the Wolverines (21–3, 8–3 Big Ten) came in ranked No. 4 in the AP poll and No. 5 in the coaches poll. Michigan State won the game at the Breslin Center, 75–52. The following month, both teams were once again ranked in the Top 10, this time Michigan was on the winning end of a game played at the Crisler Center, by a score of 58–57.\nIndiana Mr. Basketball for 2012, Gary Harris, and 2013 Indiana Mr. Basketball Zak Irvin were teammates at Hamilton Southeastern High School, but Irvin signed with Michigan after Harris had joined Michigan State. The two were best friends from third grade through high school and even wagered on the January 17, 2012, game in high school after the two had committed to different basketball programs, with Harris having to wear Maize and Blue for a day as a result.\nAt the time of the first 2013–14 Big Ten season matchup of the teams, \"Sporting News\" Bill Bender felt the rivalry was the best in the Big Ten largely due to the teams' excellence in the prior three seasons. With Michigan State riding an 11-game winning streak, including seven in conference, and Michigan riding an eight-game winning streak, including six in conference, the January 25 game marked the first time in Big Ten history that two teams have met when both teams were 6–0 or better in conference play. (#21/#25T) Michigan defeated the (#3/#3) Spartans 80–75. It was the first time Michigan ever defeated three consecutive AP Poll top ten opponents and marked the first time since the 1986–87 Iowa Hawkeyes that any team has won three consecutive games against top 10 opponents. It also gave the team consecutive road wins against top five opponents after a 36-game losing streak against them. Michigan's 7–0 Big Ten start was their best since the 1976–77 team won its first eight games.\nBoth teams advanced to the championship game of the 2014 Big Ten Conference tournament, marking the first time they have faced each other in any postseason tournament, and the first time they played three games against each other in one season. Michigan State won by a score of 69–55 securing the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. For the first rivalry contest of the 2014–15 Big Ten season, Michigan alum Nik Stauskas and Michigan State alum Draymond Green, the 2014 and 2012 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Players of the Year, respectively, had a highly publicized Twitter war of words and bet on the game.\nOn February 12, 2013, freshman Mitch McGary made his first career start in an NCAA game for the Wolverines against the Spartans, which featured Adreian Payne in the starting lineup. After Payne (15th) and McGary (21st) were both selected in the first round of the 2014 NBA draft, McGary made his first NBA start on March 13, 2015, for the 2014–15 Oklahoma City Thunder, with Payne in the starting lineup for the 2014–15 Minnesota Timberwolves as the opposing power forward.\nThe incoming class for the 2017–18 Big Ten season included high school teammates Jordan Poole and Jaren Jackson Jr. who joined Michigan and Michigan State respectively after teaming up to win the 2017 Dicks National High School Championship.\nThe 2018 Mr. Basketball of Michigan finalist lineup was composed entirely of Big Ten conference recruits, including two players for Michigan and two for Michigan State. Michigan State's Foster Loyer (3,691 points) won, while Michigan's Brandon Johns (2,792) and David DeJulius (2,542) finished second and third, respectively. Marcus Bingham, an MSU recruit, was the fourth player set to attend one of the rivals.\nIn 2019, MSU defeated the Wolverines three times, going a perfect 3–0. The second game between the two teams marked the final regular season game and decided who would share the conference championship with Purdue. Michigan State prevailed over Michigan to sweep the regular season series. In the final meeting between the team, this time in the Big Ten tournament championship, Michigan State defeated Michigan for the third time on the season. In each of the schools three meetings in 2019, each school was ranked in the top 10 of the AP Poll.\nOn January 30, 2024, Michigan State defeated the Wolverines, marking coach Tom Izzo's 700th career win as head coach for the Spartans. \nAnother element of the rivalry is that Michigan (1964, 1992*, 1993* and 2018) and Michigan State (1999 and 2001) are the only two schools to have had both their hockey team and basketball team qualify for the final four of the NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship and NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in the same season.\nAccomplishments by the two rivals.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs."

        "title": "Umpiring in the 1974–75 Ashes series",
        "text": "The main point of contention in the umpiring of the 1974–75 Ashes series was the intimidatory bowling of the Australian fast bowlers Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson. There were a few other issues, though there were the usual cases of batsmen being given out or not out despite the differing opinions of the players and umpire. At the time, umpires had no recourse to slow motion replays and had to make decisions based on what they saw in a split second, with the benefit of the doubt always going to the batsman. As a result it was not uncommon for umpires to make mistakes, which over the course of a long series tended to cancel each other out. The best an umpire could do was to make an honest judgement based on what he saw. Tom Brooks and Robin Bailhache were the umpires in all six Tests, but were junior for so important a series. Brooks having made his debut in the 1970–71 Ashes series and Bailhache in the First Test at Brisbane. Unusually for Australian umpires of the time Brooks had played First Class Cricket – he had been a lively fast-medium bowler – and as a result was more able to connect with the Test players, and was more forgiving of short-pitched deliveries which he saw as a natural part of the game. This helped England in 1970–71 when they had the fast bowlers John Snow and Bob Willis, but proved fatal for their batsmen in 1974–75.\nIntimidatory bowling.\nIan Chappell...made it clear more than once that he regarded the control of his side on the field as the concern solely of the umpires. Poor wretched men! I wonder what Ian thought might have happened if either Tom Brooks or Robin Bailhache had applied the full sanction of Law 46, and had banned either Lillee or Thomson on that emotion-charged Sunday afternoon. How many beer-cans might have besplattered the field, and angry spectators invaded the playing area? As it was the umpires contented themselves with friendly warnings afterwards described as 'unofficial'. In the circumstances it was hard to blame them.\nThe England team thought that the Australian umpires failed to apply Law 46; 'the persistent bowling of fast short-pitched balls at the batsman is unfair if, in the opinion of the umpire at the bowler's end, it constitutes a systematic attempt at intimidation'. Wisden noted that \"never in the 98 years of Test cricket have batsmen been so grievously bruised and battered by ferocious, hostile, short-pitched balls\". Both Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson had written and stated that they liked to bowl bouncers to intimidate batsmen, with Thomson's 'blood on the wicket' statement particularly offending old-fashioned sensibilities. Traditionally it was the job of the captain to restrain his bowlers if they became too aggressive, but Ian Chappell refused to do so and the Australian umpires were loath to give them official warnings. It is rare in Test cricket for an umpire to give a bowler an official warning or to ban him, and in Sydney the crowd would not have accepted such a move. To be fair the England fast bowlers John Snow and Bob Willis had bowled short and fast on the previous tour and Chappell \"employed almost the identical tactics used by Illingworth and Snow in 1970-71\" when the tourists had complained about Umpire Rowan's interference. Willis returned to bowl short in 1974-75, but was injury prone and not as fast as either Lillee or Thomson. It was possible for umpires to curb even a fast bowler like Lillee, as Dickie Bird was to demonstrate in England, but Brooks and Bailhache were relatively inexperienced and lacked authority. They also lacked the backing of the Australia Board of Control who enjoyed record profits from the series thanks to the crowd-drawing qualities of the bowlers. Keith Fletcher had his arm bruised by Thomson in the First Test and Dennis Amiss and John Edrich their hands bruised from being constantly hit with short balls. Wally Edwards was hit by a Willis bouncer in the Second Test, Colin Cowdrey on the arm by Lillee and David Lloyd painfully in the groin by Thomson. The Third Test had Fred Titmus struck a blow to the back of the knee from a ball by Thomson. In the Fourth Test Tony Greig hit Lillee on the elbow and Ashley Mallett on his bowling hand with his medium paced bouncers, John Edrich had his ribs broken when he ducked into a Lillee bouncer that kept low and Fletcher was hit on the head. In the Sixth Test Greg Chappell was struck on the chin by Peter Lever. Edrich (twice), Amiss and Lloyd were all dropped from Tests due to the severity of their injuries.\nBad Light.\nAt 3:30pm two umpires emerged from the players' race leading from the dressing rooms. The crowd roared its approval. It seemed there was going to be more play. The cordon of policemen, reinforced after the spectator intrusions of the first day, respectfully made way to allow the umpires to pass. But wait! Surely Tom Brooks does not have a beard. Robin Bailhache, slight in build though he is, is slightly more substantial than the youthful beanpole figure making his way to the centre. It took Bill Watkins, the groundsman at the M.C.G. to detect the impersonation. He hurried from his post by the covers in the centre of the ground to intercept the impostors and turn them back from whence they came. In tribute to a skillful piece of improvised humour, police sergeant Brian Watkins allowed them to make good their escape, instead of conducting them to the local lock-up.\nThe Australian umpires were willing to give the batsmen the benefit of bad light if there was a thunderstorm in the offing, or the Australian sunset came too soon and were particularly prone to do this if Lillee, Thomson or Willis were bowling. In the second innings of the First Test at Brisbane there was 35 minutes for England to bat until stumps, but as a stormcloud loomed over the ground and Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson were sending down three short balls an over. Bailhache told them they should bowl fuller, but the next ball was a Thommo bouncer and the umpire gave the English batsmen the benefit of the bad light. The Australian captain Ian Chappell complained about the umpire's interference as strictly speaking he could not tell the bowlers what to bowl and the ABC commentator Frank Tyson agreed. In the Third Test at Melbourne a couple of hoaxers dressed up as umpires during bad light and \"sold the crowd a pup\" before they were chased off.\nThe Crowds.\nThe deterioration of crowd behavior in Australia has been marked and easily observable over the last few years...Exhibitionists, generally in drunken stupor, invaded the pitches...attempted to run the gauntlet of policemen patrolling the perimeter. When they intruded upon the playing area to congratulate their heros, their sincereity extended to trying to steal their caps or snitching a bail or stump whilst the umpire was distracted by his concern for the pitch...umpire Brooks and an intruder clashed physically in the centre of the Test pitch. The invader was sent sprawling in the centre of the wicket by an exesperated umpire, who was no doubt unwise to intrude into the domain of law and order.\nThe unruliness of the crowd was readily apparent in 1974-75 as Australia beat England at home for the first time in 16 years they were more excitable than previously. \"In the background the crowd, lusting for more blood and guts, stirred the embers of controversy chanting for 'Lillee, Lillee'\" and the MCG was compared to the Colosseum or the World Cup. Australian drinking laws allowed alcohol to be sold in the grounds even when it was banned outside and in the heat many spectators became drunk. In the Third Test at Melbourne two supporters climbed the picket fence and reached the wicket before Brooks decided to physically remove one, which damaged the wicket. At Sydney in the Fourth Test Rick McCosker was disturbed by the rumpus from the notorious Sydney Hill, its members pelted Tony Greig with food and cans (some containing urine) and later did the same to the scoreboard. One full can hit Greig on the back, and Brooks had to intervene to calm them down and have the field cleared of rubbish before play could resume.\nOther Decisions.\nWalker stole a single to mid-off and with his eye fixed exclusively on the swooping fieldsman, Denness, hurtled blindly towards the bowler's wicket. Umpire Brooks, too, was concentrating on the ball and fieldsman whilst moving towards the off side and was skittled by the batsman who flung himself in the direction of safety with little or no consideration for the safety of others. Walker beat Denness's return to the wicket, but at the cost of a collision between the immovable mass and the irresistible force. Umpire Brooks, having been a first class bowler in his day was a man of some substance, and pound for pound was a good match for the burly Walker. Umpire and bowler toppled slowly to the ground and...resumed their upright position slowly...\nIn the Third Test at Melbourne Tony Greig was controversially run out when England were 157/6. Ian Chappell had thrown the ball in from the boundary as Greig was completing his third run and Marsh caught the ball and smashed the stumps as the 6'7\" South African reached for the crease with his long handled bat. Photographs later showed that he had just made his ground, but Bailhache gave him out and Greig refused to go until rudely told to leave by Greg Chappell. In the Fifth Test at the Adelaide Oval Max Walker hit what looked like an easy two only to end up at the same end as Lillee as Mike Denness threw down the stumps after a fine pick up. Lillee tried to walk to keep Walker in as he was the better batsman, but Dennis Amiss insisted that Walker was the man to go as Lillee has not left his ground and the umpire agreed. Walker had trouble again (see the above quote) in the Sixth Test at Melbourne: the burly Tasmanian ran straight into Umpire Brooks trying to avoid a run out that sent both to the ground, but Walker survived with his wicket intact. In the Third Test at Melbourne John Edrich tried to glance a ball from Ashley Mallett and was caught by Rod Marsh for 49. Bailhache gave him out, though the batsmen later said he had missed and the ball had come off his pads."

The teams included leading Australian, English, Pakistani, South African and West Indian players, most notably England captain Tony Greig, West Indies captain Clive Lloyd, Australian captain Greg Chappell and former Australian captain Ian Chappell.\nThe teams played five day \"Supertests\" and one day \"International Cup\" matches in Australia and the West Indies. The first WSC game, a Supertest between the Australians and the West Indians, began at VFL Park on 2 December 1977.\nSixteen Supertest five wicket hauls were by players from all three of the WSC teams. The first of these was by Greg Chappell on 1 January 1978. Dennis Lillee's seven wickets for twenty three runs (7/23) was the best bowling figures in World Series Cricket and Lillee also holds the record for most Supertest five wicket hauls with four.\nEight International Cup five wicket hauls were taken during World Series Cricket, with Andy Roberts claiming the first on 3 February 1978. No player took more than one five wicket haul and WSC World XI player Garth Le Roux returned the best figures with five wickets for six runs, against WSC Australia XI."

        "text": "The Hurley Boxing Law was a law passed in New Jersey in 1918 that legalized boxing in the state for the first time.\nBackground.\nBoxing exhibitions had previously been illegal under a provision of the New Jersey Crimes Act, which made it a misdemeanor for \"any two or more persons to fight together or commit or attempt to commit assaults and batteries upon each other\" or to aid and abet such an event in a public or private place.\nBoxing was a polarizing issue in New Jersey at the start of the 20th century, as some viewed the sport as an artistic form of competition and fitness, while others viewed it as a spectacle solely displaying violence and brutality. Prizefighting bouts were often held in secret locations that were difficult to find or access, such as in underground halls, barns, meadows, and in many cases, barges on rivers and bays to prevent police from breaking them up.\nThe underlying bill was introduced by NJ Assemblyman Joseph Hurley in 1917, passed by the state Senate on February 27, 1918, and was signed into law on March 5, 1918, by Governor Walter Edge. Senators Pilgrim of Essex County and Glennon of Hudson County, who supported the bill, declared that, \"boxing could not be considered a brutal sport in these days of war, but that on the contrary it was useful for young men.\"\nMany attempts were made by anti-boxing and religious groups, to no avail, to halt the Jack Dempsey-Georges Carpentier world heavyweight championship fight at Boyle's Thirty Acres on July 2, 192, and to arrest the participants, based on the fact that the New Jersey Crimes Act was technically still in effect.\nConditions.\nThe conditions required for boxing exhibitions to be permitted under the law were as follows:\nIn April 1920, New Jersey began to allow exhibitions up to 12 rounds."

The rugby union squad currently plays in Primera C, the fourth division of the URBA league system.\nHistory.\nIn 1965 a group of young rugby players thought of establishing a place where to play the sport they loved. Finally they founded the club on April 28, 1965, naming Oscar Bottone as president. The first meetings of the club were celebrated at diverse high schools of Monte Grande. That meetings later defined the name, colors and the pet of the club Monte Grande.\nIn August, 1965, the club asked Argentine Rugby Union to be registered, being supported in that requirement by Lomas Athletic and Olivos. In 1966 the team disputed a number of friendly matches (demanded by the rules of the UAR) and on March 24 the club is officially affiliated to that institution and the team began to dispute the third division championship. The first official lineup was: Corchio, Hosteter, Drew, Lasalle y Galan; Méndez y Gómez Durañona; Cavatorta, Guida y Canegallo; Torres Y Ruiz; Bottone, Cordeiro y Hernández. That team faced Club Central de Buenos Aires, winning 19-11. By those years a women's field hockey team was formed as well. They played in the same field that rugby union team.\nIn 1974 the matches had to be played at Club Vialidad Nacional of Ezeiza, Buenos Aires, which field was rented by Monte Grande. The next year all divisions of the club were disbanded therefore Monte Grande could not dispute the 1975 and 1976 seasons.\nAfter some failed attempts to merge with other clubs, in 1982 Monte Grande won the promotion to \"Tercera de Ascenso\" (third division) and the club acquired a 30 hectares land to build its sports installations, which were finally opened in 1987. In 1993 the rugby union team promoted to second division, where has remained since."

He was a switch hitter who threw left-handed, stood tall and weighed . His brother, Bruce, is a former Major League catcher.\nDave Robinson graduated from La Jolla High School and San Diego State University. He was chosen in the seventh round of the 1968 Major League Baseball draft by his hometown Padres, one year before they began play in the National League. In his second pro campaign, 1970, Robinson batted .256 with 114 hits for the Salt Lake City Bees of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League. He then was recalled by the Padres after the September 1 roster expansion. On September 10, 1970, he played his first MLB game as a defensive replacement for Padre left fielder Al Ferrara; he played two errorless innings in the field, but did not come to bat.\nTwo days later, on September 12, he started in left field against the pennant-bound Cincinnati Reds at San Diego Stadium. Facing veteran Reds' starting pitcher Tony Cloninger, Robinson received a base on balls in his first Major League plate appearance. Then, leading off the fifth inning, in his second time at bat, Robinson singled to right field and stole second base — but was left stranded when the next three Padres made outs. The following inning, he singled to left field with two outs, again off Cloninger. In his last plate appearance, in the eighth inning, he was intentionally walked by relief pitcher Clay Carroll. In his first MLB start, Robinson had two hits in two at bats, two bases on balls, and a stolen base, for a 1.000 batting average, on-base percentage and slugging average.\nRobinson would have three more multi-hit games before the end of the 1970 National League season, including back-to-back contests on September 25–26 against the San Francisco Giants at Candlestick Park, in which he hit his two MLB home runs off Skip Pitlock and future Hall of Famer Juan Marichal. All told, in his first brief big league trial, Robinson played in 15 games and had 12 hits (also including two doubles) and batted .316.\nThe following season, Robinson made the 1971 Padres out of spring training and appeared in seven games during the season's first ten days, all as a pinch hitter, drawing one base on balls and going hitless in six at bats. He spent the rest of the season at Triple-A, then left baseball after the season. He later became a teacher.\nAfter Retiring from MLB.\nRobinson was successful as a high school coach and in the Decathlon as a Masters Track and Field Athlete."

The BC Bears won the MacTier Cup going undefeated, while the Ontario Blues finished as runners-up, allowing them both to advance to the Americas Rugby Championship.\nNathan Hirayama's 36 points scored in the regular season is an all-time record for the league, during the 6 game format. The format was later changed to 10 games in the regular season, where in 2011 Dean Blanks scored 55 points, holding the current league record for points scored, albeit having played three more games.\nThe Season.\nStructure.\nThe 2009 CRC season included four Canadian senior representative teams—the BC Bears, the Prairie Wolf Pack, the Ontario Blues, and The Rock, playing against each other in a round-robin format, similar to that of The Rugby Championship, with the team that has collected the most points during the season being named champions. There were no divisions or conferences. Six games were played, each team playing every other team once. In lieu of a post-season, the champion and runner-up both continued on to participate in the ARC."

        "text": "Jalaa Sporting Club (), also known as Jeunesse Sportivo Alep (Shabibeh), is a Syrian basketball club based in the city of Aleppo. They compete in the Syrian Basketball League, and have qualified for the Asian Champions Cup on four occasions, with its best finish in 2006 and 2007, where they finished second on both occasions. \nAl Jalaa is the club with the largest number of titles in Syria and is the holder of the first Syrian basketball successes at the international level.\nHistory.\nJeunesse Sportivo Alep (Shabibeh), later known as Jalaa SC, was established under the name of the Catholic Youth Club and its headquarters was in Al-Aziziyah district. They managed to win the Syrian Basketball League for 23 consecutive years from 1956 until 1978. They also won 9 Syrian Basketball championships in this period.\nThey participated in the FIBA European Champions Cup in 6 times: 1958 (second round), 1970–71 (first round), 1971–72 (withdrew), 1972–73 (withdrew), 1975–76 (first round), and 1978–79 (quarterfinals group stage). However, they failed to secure any single win in all their matches in the competition.\nThey won the first Arab Club Championship in 1978, when they beat Orthodox BC at home in Aleppo.\nAfter 1979, there was a retreat from the positions, as the main rival of the Al-Ittihad SC club was the best basketball club in the country until the first half of the 1990s. The club therefore worked with juniors and youth.\nIn 2005, the team returned in excellent form by winning the Syrian Basketball Cup. In the following 2006 season, after defeating the cup triumph and participating in the SBL final, the team qualified for the FIBA Asia Champions Cup, where they reached the final in which they lost to Fastlink BC.\nAl-Jalaa won the Syriatel Cup (Al-Jalaa International Championship) in 2005 after defeating the Lebanese Sagesse SC in the final and achieved runner-up in the Dubai International Championship 2007.\nIn the 2007 season, the club managed to win the domestic league and the cup and reach the final of the WABA league, where they lost to Saba Battery 79-82. In the same season, a team led by Sherif Azma reached the Asian Cup final, where they lost to Saba Battery 75:83.\nIn the 2008 and 2009 seasons, the club managed to win both domestic competitions (SBL and Cup), but with the exception of winning the Aleppo Cup, it did not succeed at the international level.\nIn the 2010 season, the CJS advanced to the 2010 WABA Cup as the Syrian league runner-up, and a 79:125 loss to Mahram BC prevented them from winning the competition. As finalists of the WABA Cup, they advanced to the 2010 Asian Cup, where they finished in 6th place after a quarter-final loss to Mahram BC.\nIn the 2011 season, they became SBL champions after the final victory over Al-Jaish and qualified for the WABA Cup. In the group stage of the tournament, they gradually defeated Al-Riyadi Beirut, Zob Ahan BC, Al Riyadi Amman and Al-Ahli Sanaa and advanced to the quarterfinals, in which they defeated ASU BC. The final of the WABA League in which they met Al-Riyadi Beirut lost in the decisive match 77:85.\nAs a finalist in the WABA league, the club participated in the 2011 FIBA Asia Champions Cup, in which after advancing from the group stage, it was eliminated in the quarterfinals with Smart Gilas and finished in 6th place.\nIn 2012, CJS defeated Al-Ittihad SC in the SBL final and won its last league title. After the outbreak of the Battle of Aleppo in 2012, the club's existence was threatened. However, the club managed to survive, and after the end of the war in Aleppo it continued its sports activities.\nThe CJS gained their first big success in a long time in the 2021 season, when they managed to beat the Al-Jaish SC in the Syrian Cup final.\nHome arena.\nThe club also uses its Al Jalaa Arena for its home matches.\nClub rivalry.\nAl-Jalaa SC plays the Aleppo city derby \"El Clásico\" with its main rival Al-Ittihad SC.\nSponsorship.\nAs of 2022, the general sponsors of CJS are Katarji Group and Sinalco.\nCurrent roster.\nSquad for the 2021–2022 Syrian Basketball League season:\nTransfers.\n\"Transfers for the 2021-22 season:\"\n Joining\n Leaving"

He started the preseason as the fifth-string strong safety. In an exhibition against the Dallas Cowboys, Young recorded four tackles, three assists, an interception, and a touchdown-saving pass deflection in two quarters of playing time. He earned a spot on the Chargers' final roster. In his NFL debut, Young forced a fumble, recovered two fumbles, and intercepted a pass from Craig Morton in their season-opening win over the Denver Broncos, with the \"Los Angeles Times\" saying that \"there couldn't have been a more unlikely defensive star.\"\nOn October 9, 1983, Young picked off Jim Zorn and returned it 40 yards for a touchdown to help the Chargers beat the Seattle Seahawks 28–21. It was both his first touchdown as a pro, and his first since high school. In the 1984 season opener, Young recorded two interceptions to help the Chargers defeat the Minnesota Vikings, 42–13. He was waived by the Chargers on July 9, 1985."

It began in the fall 2011 season in the northeast, midwest and mid-atlantic, and picks up again in the spring 2012 season for the southern teams, and concludes with the final four-style semifinals and championship games on April 29-30, 2012 in Glendale, CO. \nThe final four are determined by regional tournaments. Salve Regina University of Newport, RI won the largest region - Region 1 (New England &amp; New York) by topping its 46 rugby programs; Franciscan University of Steubenville of Steubenville, OH won Region 3 (Central US) by besting 45 rugby programs. \nThe finalists from Regions 2 University of North Florida and 4 Cal-Maritime were determined in the spring rugby season. Of some note is the fact that Regions 2 and 4 have just over one-half the rugby programs within Regions 1 and 3. Region 2 appears to have only 24 rugby programs, but there is hope that 10 teams can be added from the remnants of the former USA Rugby South Division 3 college rugby program. Region 4 claims to have 31 rugby programs, however, at least four appear to be large state universities with well developed rugby programs (e.g., University of Nevada, Las Vegas which has 28,000 undergraduates - approximately 26,000 more students than Salve Regina or Franciscan). \nThis regional participation disparity between conferences is attributable to two things: 1) efforts to place teams within geographical regions according to traditional season (spring vs. fall); and 2) conference re-alignment as encouraged by USA Rugby.\nAll final four matches are expected to be broadcast live on Livestream.\nParticipating Programs.\nRegion 1 = New England &amp; New York =&gt; 42 NSCRO eligible clubs.\nNew England North - Maine (4) \nBates\nBowdoin\nColby\nUMaine Farmington\nNew England North - Boston (4) \nBabson\nTufts\nWorcester Poly\nWentworth\nNew England South (8) \nCentral Conn State\nEastern Conn State\nHartford\nNew Haven U23\nSpringfield\nTrinity\nWestern Conn State\nWestern New England\nNew England Central (6) \nSalve Regina\nRoger Williams\nUMass-Dartmouth\nMass Maritime Academy\nWheaton\nBryant\nNew England West (6) \nPlymouth State\nKeene State\nAmherst\nWilliams\nHoly Cross\nCastleton State\nNew York State East (4) \nClarkson\nPaul Smiths\nPotsdam\nRochester Inst. of Tech\nSyracuse C (1)\nNew York State West (4) \nAlfred\nBrockport C (1)\nCanisius\nRochester\nSt John Fisher\nMet New York (6) \nBard\nDrew\nMolloy\nMontclair State\nSUNY Maritime\nFairleigh Dickinson\nRutgers C (1)\nStony Brook C (1)\nRegion 2 = SouthAtlantic=&gt; 24 NSCRO eligible clubs.\nVirginia (7) \nChristopher Newport\nHampden-Sydney\nLynchburg\nRoanoke\nVirginia Commonwealth\nWashington and Lee\nWilliam and Mary\nPotomac (4) \nAmerican\nFrostburg\nMontgomery CC\nWashington\nEast Penn East (6) \nDelaware C (1)\nLaSalle\nLehigh\nRowan\nSwarthmore\nUrsinus\nWidener\nEast Penn West (7) \nAlbright\nBucknell\nF&amp;M\nGettysburg\nLock Haven\nPSU Berks\nSusquehanna\nFormer USARS (10) - Possible Addition \nLoyola\nSpring Hill\nWestern Carolina\nEckerd\nFlorida Gulf Coast\nArmstrong Atlantic State\nNorth Florida\nCharleston Southern\nNorth Georgia\nGeorgia College &amp; State\nRegion 3 = Central =&gt; 42 NSCRO eligible clubs.\nMinnesota North (5) \nBemidji State\nBethel\nMoorhead\nMorris\nNorth Dakota\nMinnesota Central (5) \nCarleton\nMacalester\nSt. Olaf\nSt. Thomas\nWisconsin-River Falls\nMinnesota South (5) \nGustavus\nLuther\nSouthwest State\nSt. Mary's\nViterbo\nWisconsin (4) \nMichigan Tech\nMilwaukee School of Engrg\nUW Eau Claire\nUW Madison C (1)\nUW Parkside\nIndiana (8) \nAnderson\nDePauw\nGrace\nIndiana-Purdue Ft.

        "text": "Dick Lucas (January 9, 1934 – April 29, 2020) was an American football player. He played college football at Boston College (1953–1955), military football for the Quantico Marines (1956–1957), and professional football for the Pittsburgh Steelers (1958) and Philadelphia Eagles (1960–1963). He died in April 2020, a victim of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nEarly years.\nLucas was born in Boston in 1934. He grew up in South Boston and attended South Boston High School. He was a star player in football, basketball, and baseball at South Boston High. In 1951, he was named to the all-conference and all-district teams and was selected by \"The Boston Globe\" as one of the city's two outstanding linemen.\nBoston College.\nHe enrolled at Boston College where he played college football at the end position from 1953 to 1955. Coach Mike Holovak in November 1955 said of Lucas: \"Lucas is a wonderful football player. Really great. Does everything well -- he blocks, he is a fine pass receiver, he is great on defense. And never opens his mouth. Just does a wonderful job every time he's in a football game.\"\nLucas received several honors while playing for Boston College. He won the school's Edward J. O'Melia Trophy in 1955 as the outstanding player in the annual Boston College–Holy Cross football rivalry game. He was also selected by \"The Boston Globe\" to its 1955 All-Northeastern football team. And Boston Mayor John Hynes declared December 13, 1955, as \"Dick Lucas Day\" in Boston.\nMilitary service and professional football.\nQuantico Marines.\nIn January 1956, Lucas was selected by the Chicago Bears in the 10th round (117th overall pick) of the 1956 NFL Draft. However, his professional football career was delayed by two years' service in the United States Marine Corps. He played on the Quantico Marines Devil Dogs football team in 1956 and 1957.\nPittsburgh Steelers.\nLucas completed his military service in 1958. The Pittsburgh Steelers acquired rights to Lucas from the Bears in September 1958. Lucas appeared in four games for the 1958 Steelers, but a knee injury and surgery sidelined him for the remainder of the season. Lucas attempted a comeback with the Steelers in 1959, but he was cut in late September as the team reduced to the league's 35-player limit.\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nLucas signed with the Washington Redskins in February 1960. He was then traded by the Redskins to the Philadelphia Eagles in September 1960. Lucas played at the tight end position for the 1960 Philadelphia Eagles team, appearing in all 12 regular-season games principally as a blocker on punt and kickoff returns and as a tackler on kickoffs. The 1960 Eagles compiled a 10–2 record and defeated the Green Bay Packers in the NFL Championship Game. Lucas appeared in the first quarter of the championship game, but missed the rest of the game with a bruised knee. He received an NFL championship ring for his role on the 1960 Eagles.\nLucas returned to the Eagles in 1961, appearing in all 14 games with eight pass receptions, five of them resulting in touchdowns. He set a record for the most touchdowns in NFL history by a player with eight or fewer receptions in a year.\nLucas remained with the Eagles in 1962, appearing in nine games, including four as a starter. After being used sparingly in the first three games of the 1963 season, Lucas was released by the Eagles on October 1, 1963. Over the course of four seasons with the Eagles, Lucas appeared in 38 games, catching 34 passes for 384 yards and six touchdowns.\nFamily and later years.\nLucas married Barbara Dunn in 1961. They had three children: Brian, Karen, and Andrea. \nAfter Lucas retired from football, he lived with his family in West Chester, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia. He worked as a sales promotions manager for Merit Oil Company. He was also president of the Eagles Alumni Association.\nLucas died in April 2020, at age 86, of complications from COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic in Philadelphia."

The team's name was reflected in the eponymous emblem that was worn on their rugby shirts.\nHistory.\nIn 1972, the Leopards played against England in Port Elizabeth, losing the match 3-36. One year later, a test against the touring Italian national side in Port Elizabeth resulted in a 4-24 defeat.\nThe Leopards undertook the first tour abroad by a black South African rugby team when they traveled to Italy for a month during May 1974. The team was \"the first South African team to tour Italy.\" The squad had 25 players and played in six fixtures, defeating Zebre in Milan, drawing against the Italian U23 side and losing four including a 10-25 defeat in the \"test\" defeat against the national side at Brescia. The latter was the only occasion when the margin of loss was by more than one score. Wingers Toto Tsotsobe and Charles Mgweba were the team's most potent strike weapons behind the pack, allied to the goal-kicking abilities of Norman Mbiko and Peter Swartz, whilst forwards Broadness Cona, Liston Ntshongwana, Patsa Matyeshana, and Morgan Cushe played to excellent effect.\n1974 Match vs Lions.\nOn 9 July 1974 the Leopards met the Lions on what would turn out to be the visitors' unbeaten tour of South Africa. The team was captained by hooker Thompson Magxala and included lock Liston Ntshongwana and Morgan Cushe at 8th Man. In their 10-56 loss to the Lions at Sisa Dukashe Stadium in Mdantsane, wing Charles Mgweba scored a try and Norman Mbiko succeeded with two penalties. Willie John McBride's side answered with 8 tries, one by scrum-half Gareth Edwards and a hat-trick by wing Tom Grace. The significance of Mgweba's try can be measured by the fact that the Springboks had not scored any tries in the two Tests that had been played against the Lions by that time.\nLineups:\nFrance.\nMany of the 1974 Leopard team featured against the touring French side of June 1975 when the teams met in Mdantsane, East London in the Eastern Cape. The French emerged as comfortable winners, 39-9. The first official South African multi-racial team to play a foreign national side was the Invitation XV which included SARB's Toto Tsotsobe and Morgan Cushe. The Invitation XV beat the French at Newlands 18-3.\nAll Blacks.\nThe touring All Blacks were the fifth touring overseas side to play against the Leopards. The fixture in late August 1976 saw the New Zealanders running out comfortable winners 31-0 in Mdantsane. The Leopards side still contained seven of the line up featured against the 1974 British Isles side.\n1979 saw the Leopards play fixtures against the Middlesex RFC side, undertaking their Centenary Tour to South Africa during May–June (including latter-day Springbok coach Nick Mallett -then at Richmond- in their squad) and they also drew 18-18 against the touring Newport squad in August.\nBritish and Irish Lions.\nA SARA XV, nominally a Leopards XV, recorded a second defeat at the hands of the British and Irish Lions of 1980 by a margin of 6-28.Cushe, who had played in the corresponding 1974 fixture captained the side. The team featured a smattering of white Northern Transvaal and Western Province players in accordance with the Lion's expressed wish to play multiracial sides, departing from what some at the time considered its African XV origins."

        "text": "The South African African Rugby Board (later renamed the South African Rugby Association) was the body that governed black African South African rugby union players during the apartheid era, and one of three segregated rugby unions operating during that time. The representative team of the African Rugby Board was known as the Leopards.\nEarly black rugby and the first union.\nAs with the game among whites, clubs for black and coloured players emerged before unions were established, and before that may have started in missionary schools. Black rugby received a considerable boost from the missionaries who introduced the game to their schools for indigenous peoples. A region that particularly benefitted from such intervention was the Eastern Cape, which remained the stronghold of black rugby until the present day.\nCanon Robert John Mullins, headmaster of the Kaffir [sic] Institution from 1864, is usually credited as the first to introduce rugby to blacks, in the shape of his students. Mullins is the father of rugby international Cuth Mullins, who played forward for the 1896 British touring team to South Africa. The Institution was initially a branch of the all-white St Andrew's College in Grahamstown, where Mullins had been a teacher. Rugby was first played at St Andrew's in 1878.\nThe earliest black rugby club probably was the Union Rugby Football Club, founded in 1887 at Port Elizabeth, with games played on the grounds where the current hospital stands. Union's first opponents were local coloured teams, but soon other black clubs were established in the city, including Orientals (founded 1894), \"followed by the Morning Star, Rovers, Frontier and Spring Rose Clubs\". Rovers and Union in turn had formed the Port Elizabeth Union by 1897. Inter-town contests were a fixture of black rugby before the end of the 19th century, with challenges occasionally issued via black newspapers such as the Xhosa-language \"Imvo Zabantsundu\".\nThe earliest attempt to establish a national rugby governing body for players of colour was the South African Coloured Rugby Football Board (SACRFB), formed in 1897 during South Africa's British colonial period. The SACRFB emerged from a meeting of all clubs and unions called to Kimberley by the Griqualand West Colonial Rugby Football Union. Black administrators like Bud Mbelle had earlier persuaded Cecil John Rhodes to provide a trophy like the Currie Cup to \"'all the coloured Sporting People in South Africa'\". The SACRFB then organized a domestic rugby competition for the Rhodes Cup, which started in 1898 and was first won by Western Province.\nIn 1905 black clubs formed the Eastern Province Native Rugby Union, whose president was Tobias Mvula.\nFounding of the Board.\nThe first rugby governing body devoted to organizing black rugby was the South African Bantu Rugby Board (SABRB), which broke away from the South African Coloured Rugby Football Board in 1935. Black rugby players and administrators was initially drawn primarily from the emerging black middle class, who also were involved in other sports transplanted to South Africa by 19th century British colonists. Accordingly, discussions about forming a Bantu Rugby Board began in 1935 with a committee formed for that purpose, continued during an inter-town rugby tournament at East London, and was concluded at the inter-provincial cricket tournament at Port Elizabeth. SABRB's first officers included J.M. Dippa of Port Elizabeth as president and Halley Plaatje, son of Sol Plaatje, of Kimberley as secretary.\nThe Bantu Rugby Board arranged the first of its annual inter-provincial tournaments in 1936 in Kimberley, in which Transvaal and Eastern Province shared the title after a goalless draw. Other participants included the Northern Eastern Districts from Aliwal North and Griqualand West, but not Western Province, Border or Natal. These tournaments were sponsored by the Chamber of Mines with a trophy called the Native Recruiting Corporation Cup, commonly known as the NRC Cup.\nMeanwhile the Coloured Rugby Football Board selected its first national side in 1938. In turn, the Bantu Rugby Board initiated test matches with their coloured counterparts to forge a sense of unity.\nConflict and alliances in the apartheid era.\nIn 1959 the Bantu Rugby Board changed its name to the South African African Rugby Board, as \"Bantu\" had acquired pejorative overtones due to its use by the apartheid state to segregate blacks, reduce their access to land and economic opportunities, and remove their civil and political rights.\nAs the struggle for political rights intensified in South Africa, black sports bodies came under increasing pressure to strengthen links with white governing bodies, or sever them. Proponents of either position hoped to attempt to transform white governing bodies by co-operation or by opposing them. The African Rugby Board decided to affiliate with the white South African Rugby Board in 1978, just as the Rugby Football Federation did.\nIn 1966 the Coloured Rugby Football Board changed their name to the South African Rugby Union (not to be confused with the current body of that name), and in 1973 became a founding member of the anti-apartheid South African Council on Sports whose slogan argued that there could be no normal sport in an abnormal society.\nThe decision by the African Rugby Board and the Rugby Football Federation to join forces with the Rugby Board cost their players dearly in terms of criticism from home and abroad, and also disqualified them from national recognition in the post-apartheid era. When the South African Rugby Union rewarded black and coloured rugby players who had represented their governing bodies in national teams with Springbok blazers, players who had not been selected for the multi-racial body were excluded from this honour on the basis that they could, technically, have qualified for selection as Springboks from 1978 onwards."

The competition culminates with 'Finals Day': a single day on which both semi-finals and the final are contested at the same ground. Somerset are the current champions, claiming their second title in the 2023 season.\nTwenty20 cricket was developed by the ECB to attract new, younger audiences to cricket. Replacing the 50 overs-per-side 'Benson &amp; Hedges Cup', the 'Twenty20 Cup' was introduced in 2003, and was over two hours shorter than its predecessor, and matches also featured greater entertainment off the field, such as live music, barbecues, fancy dress and karaoke. The competition was rebranded as the 'Friends Provident t20' in 2010, and a season later as the 'Friends Life t20'. In 2014, the competition became known as the NatWest t20 Blast. For the first seven years of the competition, teams were allowed one overseas player, as in the other domestic tournaments, but from the 2010 season, each team was allowed two. The finalists in both 2009 and 2011 qualified for the Champions League Twenty20, an international competition between the leading domestic teams from the major cricketing nations.\nThe competition was won in its inaugural season by Surrey, and in the twenty seasons that it has run, it has been won by thirteen different counties. Leicestershire and Hampshire have won the competition on the most occasions, doing so three times. Somerset have contested more finals than any other team; as well as winning the competition in 2005 and 2023, they were losing finalists in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2021."

The most hotly anticipated bout going into the second GB Championships was in the flyweight division between Welshman Andrew Selby and Khalid Yafai of England. After both boxers had got past the quarter-final stage of 2011 World Amateur Boxing Championships in Baku one month previous, it meant they would have to box off for a place at the 2012 Summer Olympics if neither boxer took gold in Azerbaijan, and Selby missed that achievement by the narrowest of margins in the final, losing 13:12. The pair met on 11 November for the first of a scheduled three fights to decide which boxer would secure Olympic qualification, with Selby recording a convincing 26:12 victory. On 12 November it was reported that Yafai had pulled out of their next encounter because he couldn't make the weight, thus granting the Welshman Olympic qualification and denying Yafai of a second Olympic Games. In other bouts, Warren Baister claimed gold with an impressive win in the 91 kg final. Salisbury ABC's Sam Maxwell earned a hard-fought 16:14 win over Wales' Joe Cordina who had beaten tournament favorite Iain Weaver the previous day. Another Liverpool boxer, Anthony Fowler beat Kieran Smith 15:9, and his conqueror of last year's championships, Callum Smith won at the 75 kg division. In the female contest, Amanda Coulsen beat Chantelle Cameron in a competitive bout, Natasha Jonas who denied Coulson of gold last year did not enter, neither did Olympians Tom Stalker, Anthony Joshua and Luke Campbell. BBC once again broadcast the event on BBC One and betting operator Betfair sponsored Team GB.\n2012 GB Amateur Boxing Championships.\nThe third GB Amateur Boxing Championships took place at the Troxy in London over Saturday 19 May/ Sunday 20 May 2012. The entries for the competition were somewhat more limited than those of recent years due to the final men's Olympic qualifier which took place in Trabzon, Turkey the month previous, therefore no Olympians entered. Great Britain Performance Director, Robert McCracken said, \"It will be a fantastic opportunity to assess the next generation and identify some of the talents that will be challenging to be part of the GB squad for the next cycle.\" A selection of the event's final bouts were broadcast live on BBC channel, BBC Two and the tournament was sponsored by Betfair for a second successive year. The most notable bouts of the finals took place in the 56 kg and 91+kg categories as Leeds boxer Qais Ashfaq boxed cleverly to overcome Wales' Sean McGoldrick who had already beat him in a previous bout. The super-heavyweight final involved Joe Joyce and Frazer Clark who landed punishing blows on each other for 4 thrilling rounds, which Joyce shaded by a single point by a score of 37:36. Also, Liverpool puncher Anthony Fowler, who boxes out of Golden Gloves ABC, claimed his second Great British title in as many years with a victory over Tamuka Muchapondwa by a convincing score of 28:14, while 49 kg Jack Bateson beat Ashley Williams 21:17 to claim gold."

The field's namesake is James J. McCann, a Poughkeepsie native and supporter of Marist athletics.\nHistory.\nIn the early 1990s, Marist trustee John J. Gartland Jr. and the McCann Foundation worked with Marist to raise funding for a baseball facility that would allow the school to compete at the Division I level. In 1991, after funding was raised, McCann Baseball Field was built. It hosted its first game on March 29, 1992, an 8–4 Marist win over Fairleigh Dickinson.\nIn 2005, the facility hosted the Empire State Games baseball tournament.\nFeatures.\nThe field's seating is located behind home plate and along the third base line. In foul territory, the field features a four-foot fence, which was installed in 2007 and allows spectators to stand along the foul lines. The outfield fences varies in height from seven to nine feet. In center field, the fence lies 414 feet from home plate, the farthest center field fence in the MAAC. The field itself is a natural turf mixture of bluegrass, rye, and fescue. It grows in a sand base, which serves as a drainage system for the field. Around the field, the facility features batting cages, bullpens, locker rooms, and a training room."

The SACRFB was founded in 1896.\nThe split with the SACRFB was driven by a number of factors and people, including personality clashes between SACRFB rugby officials Cuthbert Loriston and Abdullah Abbass. Since the 1950s black, coloured and Indian sporting codes had come under increased pressure to pursue three divergent paths: form non-racial organisations, affiliate with white associations (where they would continue within their segregated leagues), or refuse to do either. From the 1960s the formation of organisations such as the South African Sports Association and the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee pressed black sports groupings to move towards non-racial amalgamation. Danie Craven, then president of SARB, was one of the main driving forces behind the drive to affiliate coloured rugby under the SARB, believing that he could not desegregate rugby unilaterally while all other sporting codes followed the segregation policies set by the apartheid government.\nLoriston became the first president of the newly constituted SARFF, while the remainder of the SACRFB's clubs formed the SACOS-affiliated South African Rugby Union under leadership of Abass. SARU promoted non-racial rugby instead of the racially segregated associations that existed under SARB's organisational umbrella. It should not be confused with the body founded in 1992 that presently governs rugby in South Africa."

He coached New Zealand to the final of the 2023 Rugby World Cup, where they lost to South Africa.\nHe played as a fly-half for a number of New Zealand clubs, namely Waikato and the Chiefs. Foster started his coaching career with Waikato. He also contributed to New Zealand's victory in the 2015 Rugby World Cup as an assistant coach.\nPlaying career.\nDuring Foster's playing career he made 148 appearances for Waikato, a union record. He also played 28 games for the Chiefs.\nFoster also played for the NZRFU President’s XV in 1995.\nCoaching career.\nWaikato.\nFoster was the head coach of Waikato for 2002 and 2003. In 2002, Waikato finished first after the round robin stage with eight wins from nine games, but ultimately lost the final to Auckland 28-40.\nIn the 2003 season Waikato were second behind Otago after the round robin standings with six wins from nine games. They then lost their home semi-final 29-30 to Wellington.\nOverall, Foster's coaching record with Waikato was 15 wins from 21 games.\nChiefs.\nIn 2004, Foster took over as head coach of the Waikato-based Super Rugby team the Chiefs, with the following results: \nUnder Foster's coaching, the Chiefs made the Super Rugby finals in 2004 and the final in 2009 and had a 50% win ratio.\nAll Blacks.\nIn 2011, Foster became an assistant coach and selector for the All Blacks under newly-appointed head coach Steve Hansen, a position which he held until after the 2019 Rugby World Cup. During his time as assistant coach, the All Blacks won 93 of 108 tests (losing in just ten), and won the 2015 Rugby World Cup.\nIn December 2019, Foster was named the new head coach of the All Blacks, replacing Hansen, alongside assistants John Plumtree, Greg Feek, and Scott McLeod. He also announced Sam Cane as the new All Blacks captain.\nIn November 2020, Argentina beat the All Blacks for the first time.\nIn 2022, Foster came under increasing pressure after the All Blacks were defeated in a test series for the first time by Ireland. Foster's assistants Plumtree and Brad Mooar were sacked and replaced by Jason Ryan, with Foster taking on the backs coaching role and former Ireland coach Joe Schmidt joining as an advisor. Following a disappointing 26-10 loss to South Africa, the All Blacks losing run stood at 5 losses in their last 6 tests. The All Blacks bounced back with a comprehensive victory at Ellis Park against South Africa, which might have saved Foster's job. After a review, and support from many of the All Blacks squad, New Zealand Rugby opted to back Foster until the 2023 World Cup. Two weeks later, the All Blacks lost to Argentina in Christchurch, the first time Argentina had defeated the All Blacks in New Zealand. \nIn March 2023, it was announced that Scott Robertson would be taking over the All Blacks coaching position in 2024. In August, just weeks before the 2023 World Cup, Foster's All Blacks suffered the biggest test defeat in All Blacks history, losing 35-7 (a 28 point margin) against South Africa. \nPersonal life.\nFoster's daughter Michaela Foster is a professional soccer player."

The calendar includes a return of traditional tours by European teams, in which a team plays multiple Tests against a southern hemisphere side, often with mid-week matches against provincial or regional sides. This year, all three of the teams that competed in the Rugby Championship's predecessor tournament, the Tri Nations, hosted European nations in three-Test series. Australia hosted Wales, marking the first three-Test series in Australia by a top European side since the British &amp; Irish Lions' 2001 tour. South Africa hosted England for three Tests, the first extended tour of that country by a single nation since New Zealand toured in 1996.\nThe new calendar also provided expanded Test opportunities for so-called \"Tier 2\" nations. As part of this IRB initiative, another tradition returned – tours of the Pacific Islands by major nations. Scotland became the first Tier 1 nation to play a Test in the Pacific Islands since 2006, visiting Fiji and Samoa. Also, Italy toured the Americas, claiming wins over Canada and the United States and a loss to Argentina."

The Golden Eagles finished the season 26–7, 14–4 in Big East play to finish in second place.

In this game, Jae Crowder hit nine of eleven field goal attempts, and ended with 25 points. Norfolk State also won their first two game in the tournament, so the two teams faced each other for the tournament championship. Marquette had played Norfolk State just a week earlier in Milwaukee, in a game that was never in doubt. Marquette opened up a 6–0 lead, expanded the lead to eleven by halftime, then scored 59 points in the second half to win the game 99–68.\nWhen the two teams met in the Paradise Jam final, the game started out similarly to the early game, with Marquette never trailing, and reaching a nine point lead at halftime. However, instead of scoring 59 points in the second half, they would score only 59 points in the game. The Golden Eagles, ranked 16th in the AP poll, held a 14 point lead at one time, but Norfolk State had two 7–0 runs and tied up the game at 57 points apiece with just over two minutes left.

        "text": "Michael William Salmon (born December 27, 1970) is a former American football defensive back in the National Football League.\nFootball career.\nSalmon named both the 5A Arizona High school football Player of the year and the Arizona Athlete of the year in 1989 by the Arizona Republic. He was recruited out of Greenway high school in 3 sports, football, baseball and basketball. In 1988 Salmon was selected by USA Today as the National H.S. Player of the Week after helping Greenway upset the #1 ranked Brophy Broncos on T.V. A game in which Salmon caught a T.D., threw for 2 T.D.'s, intercepted 2 passes, kicked 2 field goals and made 4 extra points all in the first half. Salmon later signed with the University of Southern California. Salmon was a team captain, started all four seasons at either free safety, strong safety, cornerback, outside linebacker, kicker, and punt returner. He holds the schools of all time record for positions started in a career. Salmon played both football and baseball for the USC Trojans. He batted .280 as a junior on the USC Trojans baseball team. Salmon turned down a chance to play professional baseball, like his older brother Tim, rejecting an $80,000 offer by the Philadelphia Phillies to accept USC's scholarship offer. Against Washington State in 1993, Salmon beat out future NFL kicker Cole Ford . Salmon entered the game and made four field goals from greater than 38 yards and was named Pac-10 Player of the week. \"Here's a guy who hadn't kicked since high school, and he couldn't wait to get in there and kick,\" Coach John Robinson said. \"If it'd been me, I'd have been scared to death.\" Salmon also kicked the game winning kick that year at Oregon as time expired in front of a sold out stadium. Salmon was on the Deans List twice at USC and also had the top GPA on the football team in 1992.\n\"He may be more important to our defense than (quarterback) Rob Johnson is to our offense,\" Salmon's defensive coordinator at USC, Don Lindsey, said. \"We have an outstanding backup quarterback in Kyle Wachholz, so if we lost Rob it would hurt us, but it wouldn't be a killer. But if we lost Mike, the defense would lose a whole lot.\" On Senior Day in 1993, against the UCLA Bruins, as Salmon entered the Coliseum for the last time, USC coach John Robinson introduced Salmon as \"one of the most competitive guys I have ever had\".\nSalmon played in the NFL for the San Francisco 49ers (1994-1997) and the Buffalo Bills (1996). Salmon backed up the two NFC pro bowl safeties Merton Hanks and Tim MacDonald in San Francisco. In Buffalo by backed up AFC pro bowl safeties Henry Jones and Kurt Shultz.

Salmon had four interceptions in two years with Rhein Fire where he was later named to the All World League First-team at Free Safety and team captain.\nPersonal.\nMike Salmon is the younger brother of former Major League Baseball right fielder Tim Salmon, who was named the American League's Rookie of the Year in 1993 and World Series Champion in 2002 for the Los Angeles Angels. His cousin is Academy Award-winning Best Actress Holly Hunter. In 2012, Mike Salmon had his football jersey retired at Greenway High School in Phoenix, Arizona. He is the first and only football player to have his number retired in school history. His brother Tim is the only baseball player in the school's history to have his baseball number retired.\nHe lives in Newport Beach, California with his wife, Nina, and three children (Jack, Nick, and Brooke). Salmon serves as vice chairman of the board of directors of the Lott Trophy, an annual college football award given to a defensive player that exhibits excellence on and off the field.\nSalmon received two degrees Bachelor's degree in Urban and Regional Planning and Communications from the University of Southern California, where he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity and named to the All Phi Delta Theta football team all four years he played."

        "text": "The 2012 Masters Tournament was the 76th Masters Tournament, held April 5–8 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia. Bubba Watson won the year's first major championship on the second hole of a sudden-death playoff, defeating Louis Oosthuizen. It was his first major title and his fourth victory on the PGA Tour. Watson was the eighth consecutive first-time major champion, and the 14th winner in as many majors. He won a second Masters two years later in 2014.\nTwo pre-tournament favorites, Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy, both finished at 293 (+5) in a tie for 40th place. Phil Mickelson was in the final pairing and in contention during the final round, but a triple-bogey six on the fourth hole knocked him back and he finished two strokes behind, in a four-way tie for third. Bo Van Pelt posted the lowest round of the tournament with a 64 (−8) early on Sunday, which propelled him up the leaderboard 35 places to tie for 17th.\nIt was the first playoff in three years at the Masters; Ángel Cabrera won on the second extra hole in 2009.\nField.\nThe Masters has the smallest field of the four major championships. Officially, the Masters remains an invitation event, but there is a set of qualifying criteria that determines who is included in the field. Each player is classified according to the first category by which he qualified, but other categories are shown in parentheses.\nGolfers who qualify based solely on their performance in amateur tournaments (categories 6–10) must remain amateurs on the starting day of the tournament to be eligible to play.\nThree players were appearing in their first major: Kelly Kraft, Corbin Mills and Randal Lewis. Twelve others were appearing in their first Masters: Keegan Bradley, Patrick Cantlay, Bryden Macpherson, Kevin Chappell, Robert Garrigus, Webb Simpson, Harrison Frazar, Kyle Stanley, Scott Stallings, Brendan Steele, Bae Sang-moon and Gonzalo Fernández-Castaño.\nNotable absences included Mark O'Meara (injured), Ernie Els and Retief Goosen (not ranked high enough). O'Meara had appeared in the previous 27 Masters, Els in the previous 18, and Goosen in the previous 12.

The leaderboard was active, as four players held at least a share of the lead during the final round. Louis Oosthuizen charged into the lead at the second hole with an albatross two on the par-5. It was only the fourth double eagle in Masters history and the first-ever on the second hole. The final pairing faltered: 54-hole leader Peter Hanson never got it going, with three bogeys before he carded his first birdie at the 15th hole. Three holes earlier, Hanson shanked his tee shot on the par-3 12th short of the water, bogeyed, and fell from contention. On the front nine, three-time Masters champion Phil Mickelson pushed his tee shot left at the par-3 fourth and it caromed off a greenside grandstand. He made his second triple bogey of the week and came up two shots short of the playoff.\nIn the end, it came down to a three player race between Oosthuizen, Bubba Watson, and Matt Kuchar. Kuchar hit his approach at the 15th hole to three feet (0.9 m) and eagled to temporarily tie Oosthuizen at −9, but followed it with a bogey at the par-3 16th hole and finished two strokes back, in the four-way tie for third. After Watson made a two at the 16th for his fourth consecutive birdie, he was tied at the top with Oosthuizen at −10. Playing together in the penultimate pairing, both parred the 17th hole and were on the green in regulation at the uphill 18th. Oosthuizen missed a birdie putt from the back shelf and Watson had for his first major, but he missed the putt on the high side. After Watson tapped in, Oosthuizen holed his four-footer (1.2 m) to force a sudden death playoff.\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nPlayoff.\nThe sudden death playoff started at the par-4 18th hole, where both players hit the fairway and green, and similar to the final round, Bubba Watson was closer to the pin than Louis Oosthuizen. Oosthuizen narrowly missed his birdie effort which gave Watson another opportunity to secure the title. Watson's putt from was low the entire way, and after both players tapped in to tie they headed to the next tee at the downhill par-4 10th hole.\nBoth players hit poor drives to the right, and Oosthuizen's second shot ended up short of the green. The left-handed Watson, playing from the pine straw deep in the woods, hooked his approach shot nearly 90 degrees to within of the hole. Oosthuizen chipped to the back of the green and narrowly missed his par putt to give Watson two putts to win. He lagged his first to a foot (0.3 m) and tapped in to become the Masters champion.\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative playoff scores, relative to par\""

        "text": "Evan Shane Crawford (born September 2, 1986) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto Blue Jays.\nAmateur career.\nCrawford was born in Prattville, Alabama and went to Prattville High School, where he led his team to an Alabama state record with 47 wins and a state 6A runner-up. He threw two no-hitters, was the team's best hitter his senior year, and Perfect Game USA ranked him #88 out of the top 1000 HS players, and was the eighth-best left-handed pitcher. Despite this, he was not drafted out of high school, and went on to Auburn University.\nIn his 2006 freshman year at Auburn, he went 5–8 with a 4.35 ERA. After his freshman year, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League with the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox, going 0–1 with a 6.43 ERA. In his sophomore year, he went 5–6 with a 5.91 ERA for Auburn, and again played in the Cape Cod League, going 1–0 with a 0.67 ERA in 16 relief appearances and being named a league all-star for the Harwich Mariners. In his junior season at Auburn, he went 3–0 with a 2.42 ERA in 29 appearances, exclusively in relief. He was drafted in the eighth round of the 2008 MLB Draft, 249th overall, by the Blue Jays.\nProfessional career.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nHe was assigned to the Low-A Auburn Doubledays, going 0–2 with a 3.03 ERA. He played for Auburn again in 2009, going 1–5 with a 4.06 ERA. He started 2010 with the Single-A Lansing Lugnuts, going 3–2 with a 4.01 ERA before being promoted to the High-A Dunedin Blue Jays, where he went 1–2 with a 2.04 ERA and 3 saves.\nHe played 2011 with the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats, going 3–5 with a 3.35 ERA and 2 saves. On November 18, he was promoted to the big league roster to be protected from the Rule 5 draft.\nCrawford did not make the Blue Jays out of spring training, but on April 13, 2012, he was called up to the active roster to fill the vacancy created when Sergio Santos took a three-day paternity leave. Upon Santos's return, left hander Aaron Laffey was optioned to Triple-A, allowing Crawford to remain on the active roster.\nCrawford made his first career appearance on Jackie Robinson day (April 15), pitching a scoreless 9th inning in an 8–2 win over the Baltimore Orioles. He recorded his first career strikeout against third baseman Wilson Betemit. After his second appearance on the 19th (another scoreless inning), Crawford was sent down to the minors immediately after the game to make room for Drew Hutchison. However, he was recalled to the big leagues only two days later when Sergio Santos went on the disabled list. Crawford made three further appearances, giving up 2 runs over 2 innings, before being sent to the minors again on May 2.\nOn May 14, Crawford was called up to the Jays for the third time in just over a month. He got into that night's game, pitching a scoreless inning against the Tampa Bay Rays. After appearing in two more games as a reliever, he was sent down to the minors again on May 25.\nOn June 11, Crawford was called back up to Toronto for the fourth time in just under two months. He made one appearance on June 12 (pitching 0.1 innings), then was sent back to the minors on June 18.\nCrawford was recalled to the Blue Jays yet again on July 26. He pitched one-third of an inning on July 29, then was sent back to Triple-A on July 31 following the Jays trading for pitchers Brad Lincoln and Steve Delabar.\nTwo weeks later on August 14, after having made several appearances with the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s, Crawford was placed on the disabled list retroactive to August 12. This effectively ended his season, as Crawford did not pitch again in 2012, and was not amongst the Blue Jays September call-ups.\nAfter spending the first part of the 2013 season in the minor leagues, Crawford was designated for assignment by the Blue Jays on June 8, 2013, to make room for Dustin McGowan on the roster. After clearing waivers, Crawford was assigned to the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats on June 10.\nChicago White Sox.\nOn December 12, 2013, Crawford was selected by the Chicago White Sox in the minor-league phase of the Rule 5 draft. He was released on July 1, 2014."

A schism occurred in the late 1980s, which resulted in some members joining another local Suburban Rugby Club, the Cavaliers. Upon folding, some remaining members joined Lane Cove, ensuring a healthy rivalry between the clubs.\nThe Cavaliers.\nThe Cavaliers started as Eastwood Methodist in the early 1970s in Sydney's Protestant Church rugby competition. They joined Suburban Rugby as Roslea in the late 1970s, before changing their name to the Cavaliers in the 1980s. The Cavaliers won one Suburban premiership, winning the Grose Cup (2nd Grade) in 1992.\nEpping Rams Seniors Restart.\nIn 1997, the Cavaliers were invited to join the Epping Rams, as the senior club, and immediately scored success, by winning the Grose Cup (4th Division, 2nd Grade). In 2000, the Epping Rams seniors were promoted to 3rd Division, and won the Clark Cup (3rd Division, 1st Grade) premiership the following year, in 2001.\nFollowing a Campbell Cup (3rd Division, 3rd Grade) premiership in 2004, the Epping Rams had a great year in 2005. After securing the 3rd Division Club Championship, Epping's 1st, 2nd and 3rd grade sides all made grand finals, with the 1st grade (Clark Cup) and 3rd grade (Campbell Cup) teams winning their premierships.\nEpping were promoted to 2nd Division in 2006, but returned to 3rd Division after the 2008 season.\nFollowing a loss in the 2011 Radford Cup (3rd Division, Colts) grand final, Epping won the 2013 edition, finishing the year as undefeated premiers.\nEpping secured the 2017 3rd Division Club Championship, with first and third grade teams (as minor premiers) and colts making finals. First grade would go on to win the Clark Cup for the third time.\nAfter returning to Division 2 in 2018, Epping would have middling success. In 2020, the club's Blunt Cup (3rd grade) side would contest the grand final, winning it for the first time.\nIn 2022, the club was unable to field a colts (Under 21's) side and were not able to comply with the NSWSRU's requirements for Division 2. With the absence of Division 3, Epping were forced to compete in the Division 4 competition in 1st and 2nd Grade, while 3rd and 4th Grade were later invited to compete in the Division 2 Blunt and Richardson Cups. A tough season ensued, however, the club was strong enough to compete in the finals series in all four grades.\nA partnership with Hunters Hill Rugby saw the re-establishment of a Colts side at Epping in 2023. This led to the club's inclusion in the NSWSRU Division 2 competition. In 2023, the club's 1s, Colts, 3s and 4s all competed in the finals series.\n2023 also saw many milestones for the club, including Club Legend Scott Thurbon playing his 500th game for the Rams.\nHonours.\nSenior Rugby.\nSuburban Rugby Representative Team Honours.\nOpens:\nUnder 19's:\nColts 7's\nNotable players.\nEpping players who have gone on to gain international or provincial caps include: Ian Williams, Mick Mathers, Brett Papworth, Matt Mostyn, Steve Tuynman (the Club Patron), Matt Burke and Lachlan Turner."

        "title": "List of international cricket centuries by Sunil Gavaskar",
        "text": "Sunil Gavaskar is a former international cricketer who represented and captained the Indian cricket team. In a career spanning over 16 years he made 35 centuries (100 or more runs) at the international level. Described as one of the greatest opening batsmen in cricket history, Gavaskar played 125 Test matches and scored 10,122 runs. He was the first batsman to score 10,000 Test runs and held the record for most runs until Allan Border surpassed it. Gavaskar's record of 34 Test centuries stood for almost two decades before Tendulkar surpassed it in December 2005. He was named the \"Indian Cricket\" Cricketer of the Year in 1971 and as one of the \"Wisden\" Cricketers of the Year in 1980. In February 2012, the International Cricket Council (ICC) inducted him into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. As of 2012, he is the third-highest run scorer for India in Test cricket, after Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid.\nMaking his Test debut against the West Indies in March 1971, Gavaskar scored his first century in the third Test of the same series. In the final Test at Port of Spain he scored centuries in both innings of the match with scores of 124 and 220, becoming the second Indian player to perform the feat. He became the first player to score two centuries in a Test match for the third time, when he made 107 and 182 not out in a match against the West Indies in December 1978. Gavaskar's highest Test score of 236 not out came against the West Indies at Chennai in 1983, an Indian record at that time. He has scored 150 or more runs in a Test match innings on twelve occasions. Gavaskar was most successful against the West Indies and Australia scoring 13 and 8 centuries respectively.\nGavaskar made his One Day International (ODI) debut against England at Headingley in 1974. Unlike his Test career, his ODI career was less illustrious scoring 3,092 runs at an average of 35.13. Gavaskar's solitary century in ODIs came in the penultimate innings of his career—against New Zealand—during the 1987 Cricket World Cup where he scored 103 runs in 88 balls; the performance ensured India's victory, which earned him a man of the match award."

        "title": "Proteas (rugby union)",
        "text": "The Proteas was the representative side of the South African Rugby Football Federation, one of three racially segregated rugby union governing bodies in apartheid South Africa.\nIn December 1971 the Proteas embarked on a six-match tour of Britain and Holland – the first \"Coloured\" rugby team to tour abroad. Arriving on the 13th, they were met at the airport by protesters from anti-apartheid movements. The Proteas lost their first match 3–14 to Hertfordshire at Croxley Green on 16 December, after the home side had led 10–3 at half-time. A fight broke out during the game, which the press blamed on the Proteas' tactic of tackling at head height. The tour ended with a 33–3 loss to the United Hospitals on 2 January 1972 in London. Cuthbert (Charles) Loriston, the Proteas' team manager and SARFF's first president, explained that the purpose of the tour was \" 'to test our strength' \". He said that the two wins, a draw, and three losses proved that \" 'we have the technical know-how and enthusiasm to build strong opposition within the next five years' \". The wins came against county side Oxfordshire (33–5) and a London team (19–12). Loriston said that the next steps would be to play against white teams that tour South Africa, such as England's intended visit the next year; to play white South African teams; and then move towards integration of sports. He concluded that the Proteas had found, despite their initial scepticism, that they were treated \" 'differently than...at home' \".\nThe first of Loriston's next steps was duly made on 22 May 1972 when the Proteas side lost narrowly (6–11) to John Pullin's touring England side in Cape Town. England had undertaken a short, unbeaten seven match tour to the Republic and whilst the headlines in the UK were undoubtedly linked to his side's 18–9 test match victory, the Proteas versus England fixture remains the first reported international rugby match in which coloureds played against whites on South African soil. The Sunday Times later reported that the showings of both the Proteas side and the black's Leopards side (who lost considerably more heavily against England two days later in Port Elizabeth) \" gave the lie to the oft-repeated claim in South Africa that no blacks are ready for a trial against the top local white players.\"\nOn Tuesday 4 June 1974, the Proteas played against the touring Lions side at Goodwood Showground in Cape Town. Fly-half Errol Tobias scored the only points (a penalty and a drop-kick) for the Proteas, who were beaten 6–37 by the visitors. The team included Hennie Shields, John Noble, Turkey Shields, and Doug Dyers. For the Lions, centre Dick Milliken, wing J. J. Williams, lock Gordon Brown, flank and captain Fergus Slattery scored a try each. Fullback Andy Irvine (a conversion, three penalty kicks) and fly-half Alan Old (two penalties) also contributed.\n1974 also saw the Proteas compete against the Leopards in what have been referred to as two mini tests in Johannesburg and Port\nElizabeth, respectively.\n1975 saw the French undertake an eleven match tour to South Africa which included two tests. They played their third tour fixture against the Proteas at Goodwood in Cape Town on 4 June 1975 winning by a comfortable 37–3 margin. It was perhaps the events that unfurled at Newlands some three days which resonated louder when a South African Invitation XV,the first official mixed-race team (containing white, black and coloured players) ever fielded in South Africa ran out 18–3 winners against the touring side. Strand prop Turkey Shields and Stellenbosch's try-scoring wing, John Noble represented the Federation in the victorious Invitation XV.\nDuring the 1976 All Black tour of South Africa, the Proteas were defeated 3–25 by the tourists on a wet 7 July at Goodwood Oval in Cape Town before a crowd of 10,000. The full-strength All Black team included players such as Laurie Mains, Bill Osborne, Sid Going, Andy Leslie, Frank Oliver and Lawrie Knight. Among the Proteas were John Noble and Charles Williams (who would later go on to represent the South African Barbarians side who toured Britain in 1979).\nBilly Beaumont's British and Irish Lions touring side of 1980 defeated a Proteas XV 15–6 in front of a crowd of 15,000 at the Danie Craven Stadium on 27 May 1980. The nomenclature Proteas XV is of import here and the distinction is made since whilst the Proteas' running backline included notable SARFF star players such as Ronnie Louw, John Noble, Hennie Shields, Charles Williams, Frankie Davids, Errol Tobias (who notched two penalties on the day) and Attie Lategan, the Proteas' forward pack's front five was composed entirely of white Western Province players. A similar arrangement had been witnessed when the Lions played a Leopards XV bolstered by numerous WP and Northern's personnel a little under two weeks earlier in the tour match in Border and signified recognition that the touring party had expressed a commitment that it would not compete against teams overtly selected on racial grounds alone.\nWithin four months, the Federation's star outside half, Errol Tobias was included in the Springboks' Tour party to South America and 30 May 1981 saw Tobias become the first non-white to be capped when he was selected at outside centre in the 12–10 defeat of Fergus Slattery's Irish touring side."

        "title": "Brad Miller (baseball)",
        "text": "Bradley Austin Miller (born October 18, 1989) is an American professional baseball utility player who is a free agent. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Seattle Mariners, Tampa Bay Rays, Milwaukee Brewers, Cleveland Indians, Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals, and Texas Rangers.\nMiller grew up playing Little League baseball in Windermere, Florida, before attending Olympia High School, where he served as the team's shortstop. Although the Texas Rangers selected him in the 2008 MLB Draft, Miller chose to play college baseball for the Clemson Tigers. As a junior in 2011, he won the Brooks Wallace Award, given annually to the best shortstop in college baseball. Miller was also named twice to the United States national collegiate baseball team, including appearances at the 2009 World Baseball Challenge and the 2010 World University Baseball Championship.\nThe Mariners selected Miller in the second round of the 2011 MLB Draft, and he quickly rose through the Seattle farm system, making his major league debut in 2013. Throughout the 2014 season, Miller was in competition with several other Mariners for the role of starting shortstop, and by May 2015, he was being utilized as a \"super utility\" player, similar to Ben Zobrist. Miller was traded to the Rays prior to the 2016 season, where he was used first as the starting shortstop, then as the starting first baseman, and finally as the starting second baseman. After a banner 2016 season in which he hit 30 home runs, a series of injuries derailed Miller's next two seasons, and he was traded to the Brewers in 2018. Miller spent only one month within the Brewers organization before he was released. He then underwent microfracture surgery to repair a torn hip labrum.\nMiller spent the 2019 season with a number of teams. He opted out of a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, and made a brief appearance with the Indians before he was designated for assignment. After Miller spent some time with the Yankees' Triple A team, the Phillies signed him to take over as their utility player after Jay Bruce became their starting left fielder. Miller spent 2020 with the Cardinals before returning to the Phillies the following year.\nEarly life.\nMiller was born on October 18, 1989, in Orlando, Florida, and grew up in Windermere. He began playing Little League baseball with a Windermere club and was childhood friends with future Major League Baseball (MLB) second baseman Nick Franklin. Miller's father, Steve, played college baseball for the Northern Iowa Panthers and served as his son's baseball coach from Little League to the beginning of high school.\nMiller attended Olympia High School in Orlando, serving as the team's shortstop. As a sophomore in high school, Miller was invited to join retired MLB player Chet Lemon's summer Amateur Athletic Union team, \"Juice\". As a junior, Miller had a .420 batting average for Olympia, with a .560 on base percentage, six home runs, and 31 runs batted in (RBIs), and was named the team's Most Valuable Player.\nCollege career.\nThe Texas Rangers selected Miller in the 39th round of the 2008 MLB Draft, but he elected to attend Clemson University on a full college baseball scholarship. As a freshman at Clemson in 2009, Miller started all 66 games for the Tigers at shortstop. His first collegiate home run came on February 22, 2009, in a 6–5 extra innings victory over Charlotte. As a sophomore in 2010, Miller led Clemson with a .357 batting average. He also had eight home runs, a .458 on-base percentage, and nine stolen bases in 69 games. That same year, he helped take Clemson to the semifinal rounds of the 2010 College World Series, where they eventually fell to the University of South Carolina.\nAs a junior in the 2011 season, Miller led the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) with a .395 batting average and a .498 on-base percentage. Additionally, he recorded 11 doubles, three triples, five home runs, 50 RBIs, 53 runs, and 21 stolen bases in 56 games for Clemson, 54 of which were starts. At the end of the year, Miller received the Brooks Wallace Award, given to the best college baseball shortstop that season. Miller was also named the 2011 ACC Player of the Year and was a Louisville Slugger First-Team All-American as named by \"Collegiate Baseball\". Clemson once again reached the college baseball postseason but was eliminated by Connecticut during the regional rounds.\nIn both 2009 and 2010, Miller was named to USA Baseball's Collegiate National Team. He helped lead the team to an overall 19–5 record and a World Baseball Challenge title. Starting in 15 of 23 games for Team USA in 2009, Miller collected 14 hits, 13 runs, and eight RBIs. Miller joined the Collegiate National Team again in 2010, when Team USA lost to Cuba in the gold medal match of the 2010 World University Baseball Championship.\nProfessional career.\nSeattle Mariners.\nMinor leagues.\nThe Seattle Mariners selected Miller in the second round, 62nd overall, in the 2011 MLB Draft, and he signed with the team that August. He spent the 2011 season with the Clinton LumberKings, the Mariners' Single–A minor league affiliate, and made a fast impression upon the team by batting .415 in his first 14 professional baseball games.\nMiller started the 2012 season with the High–A High Desert Mavericks of the California League. By July, he ranked second in hits (136) and runs (87) and fourth in doubles across all of minor league baseball. Mavericks manager Pedro Grifol said that he was most impressed by how Miller \"doesn't get tired ... He's the same guy every day with the same intensity, and his work capacity is off the charts\". He was also named to the California League All-Star team and was named the league Player of the Week for the week ending April 15. Miller spent the second part of the season with the Double–A Jackson Generals. Between the two teams, Miller finished the 2012 season with a .334 average, 15 home runs, and 68 RBIs in 137 games. He ranked second among all Minor League Baseball players with 186 hits and led all members of the Mariners farm system with 56 multi-hit games. At the end of the season, he received the Mariners Heart and Soul Award for \"exemplary play and leadership skills both on and off the field\".\nAfter playing 21 spring training games with the Mariners, Miller returned to Jackson in 2013 as MLB.com's ninth-highest Mariners prospect. He played 42 games with Jackson in 2013, batting .294 with six home runs and 25 RBIs in 153 at bats. He was quickly promoted to the Triple–A Tacoma Rainiers, where he hit .356 with six home runs and 28 RBIs in his first 22 games. At the end of June, Miller and pitcher Taijuan Walker were selected to play for Team USA in the 2013 All-Star Futures Game. Miller would not participate in the game itself, however, due to a call-up to the major leagues.\nMajor leagues.\nMiller was called up to the Mariners on June 28, 2013, and made his major league debut the same day against the Chicago Cubs. Although he did not record a hit, his offensive and defensive plays impressed manager Eric Wedge, who said that Miller had \"a solid first game\". Miller's first two major league home runs came on July 19 in a 10–7 win against the Houston Astros, making him the second Mariner rookie, behind childhood friend Franklin, to hit his first two career home runs in the same game. He was also the first player in Mariners history to play two games with at least four RBI in the first 17 games of his career. His performance in that July 19 game earned Miller his first American League (AL) Player of the Week title for the week ending July 21.\nOn August 14, 2013, both Miller and Tampa Bay Rays player Ben Zobrist recorded both a leadoff and an additional home run. It was the second time in MLB history that both teams' leadoff hitters accomplished such a feat, following Chuck Knoblauch of the Minnesota Twins and Tony Phillips of the Detroit Tigers in 1994. Prior to that game, neither batter had led off a major league game with a home run. Miller closed out the season with his first career grand slam, which came in the fifth inning of a 7–5 win over the Oakland Athletics on September 28. In his rookie season, Miller batted .265 with eight home runs and 36 RBIs in 76 games and 306 at bats.\nGoing into the 2014 season, the Mariners signed Robinson Canó to serve as their everyday second baseman. This in turn pushed Miller into competition with Franklin, who had played second base the previous season, for the starting shortstop position. Miller's performance in spring training, batting .410 with four home runs and a 1.314 on-base plus slugging (OPS), won him the starting shortstop job. He struggled both offensively and defensively in the first part of the season, striking out in nearly 30% of his plate appearances in April and committing six errors in the first 34 games of the season, most of which occurred during routine plays. After what looked like a brief resurgence in June, Miller continued to slump, and the Mariners called up Chris Taylor from Tacoma on July 25 to take over the position. Taylor and Miller split the remainder of the season half and half. Miller finished the 2014 season with a .221 average, 10 home runs, and 36 RBIs in 123 games and 367 at bats.\nMiller and Taylor entered 2015 in competition for the starting shortstop role, a position which Miller won by default after Taylor broke a bone in his wrist in mid-March and was expected to be sidelined for four to six weeks. When Taylor returned in early May, he was made the team's shortstop, while Miller was told that he would play in a \"super utility role\", similar to that of Zobrist. He received his second career AL Player of the Week honor on May 17, following a six-game hitting streak that included three multi-hit games. His role as a utility player included a brief and unsuccessful stint in center field, which negatively impacted his overall defensive performance. Offensively, Miller batted .258 for the season, with 11 home runs and 46 RBIs in 438 at bats.\nTampa Bay Rays.\nOn November 5, 2015, the Mariners traded Miller, first baseman Logan Morrison, and pitcher Danny Farquhar to the Tampa Bay Rays in exchange for pitchers Nathan Karns and C. J. Riefenhauser, as well as outfield prospect Boog Powell. Serving as the Rays' shortstop in 2016, Miller struggled defensively, committing 13 errors in his first 90 games. Offensively, his performance was stronger, setting the franchise record with 17 single-season home runs as a shortstop. His record-setting 16th season home run as a shortstop came on July 31 in a game against the New York Yankees. The ball landed in the Rays Touch Tank, a hands-on aquarium exhibit in center field. He was the fifth player to notch a home run into the Touch Tank since it opened in 2006.\nDespite improving in the middle infield in the month of July, with his last error coming on July 6, the Rays moved Miller to first base in August after acquiring Matt Duffy from the San Francisco Giants. At the time, regular first baseman Morrison had been on the disabled list; when he returned, Miller remained at first base while Morrison became a designated hitter. Miller capped off his breakout hitting year on September 21 in an 11–5 win against the Yankees. First, he was responsible for the second of three consecutive home runs in the third inning of the game, bookended by Evan Longoria and Corey Dickerson. In the eighth inning, Miller hit an additional solo home run to boost his season total to 30. He trailed off after that, batting only .158 in his last 27 games and ending the season with an 0-for-18 slump. In his first season with the Rays, Miller batted .243 and set career highs with 30 home runs and 81 RBIs.\nFollowing the departure of Logan Forsythe, Rays manager Kevin Cash placed Miller at second base for the 2017 season, saying that he was \"still going to play short because we know that versatility will help us. But he is all about playing second base and being a really good one.\" Miller scored the first walk-off RBI of his career on April 8, when Toronto Blue Jays reliever Casey Lawrence walked him with the bases loaded in the 11th inning of a 2–2 deadlock. Miller's RBI walk brought home Mallex Smith, winning the game for Tampa. A pair of injuries, first a left abdominal strain and then a right groin strain, sidelined Miller for a combined 42 games. In his absence, Tim Beckham took over at second base, a position he retained until being traded to the Baltimore Orioles on July 31, allowing Miller to return to his position. Miller's injuries negatively impacted his offensive performance in 2017; he hit a career low .201 in 110 games, and his nine home runs were the fewest since his rookie season.\nMiller missed a large part of the Rays' 2018 spring training after suffering a pinky toe fracture on February 23, leaving his major league role in question. Due to his series of injuries and lukewarm performance, Miller was designated for assignment on June 7, 2018, to make room on the 25-man roster for first base prospect Jake Bauers. At the time, Miller was hitting .256 with five home runs and 21 RBIs in 48 games.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nOn June 10, 2018, the Rays traded Miller to the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for utility player Ji-man Choi. Miller started his Brewers tenure as the shortstop for the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox but was promoted on June 23 after right fielder Domingo Santana was optioned to the minors. On July 2, 2018, Miller recorded the second walk-off walk of his career, joining Adrian Beltre and Russell Martin as the only active MLB players at the time to have multiple walk-off walks. Miller was designated for assignment on July 28 to make room in the lineup for recently acquired infielder Mike Moustakas. After being released from his contract shortly thereafter, Miller underwent arthroscopic surgery in late August to repair a torn hip labrum that he had suffered in 2017. The microfracture surgery was similar to one undergone by Corey Seager, and was intended to address cartilage damage from the injury. Miller played in 27 games for Milwaukee, batting .230 with two home runs, eight RBIs, and five runs.\nCleveland Indians.\nMiller signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers on February 28, 2019, with the expectation that he would take over the second baseman role abdicated by Chase Utley. On March 21, however, Miller opted out of his contract and became a free agent when he learned that he would not be named to the Dodgers' Opening Day roster. Three days later, Miller signed a one-year, $1 million contract with the Cleveland Indians. He began the season at second base, filling in for an injured Jason Kipnis. When Kipnis returned from the disabled list on April 15, Miller was designated for assignment. Miller was frustrated with the team's decision to remove him from the roster, telling reporters, \"Obviously, they don't want the best guys up there. So I'm just trying to take it somewhere else and see what we've got.\" After clearing waivers, Miller elected free agency on April 17. He batted .250 in Cleveland, with one home run and four RBIs in 36 at bats.\nNew York Yankees.\nThe New York Yankees signed Miller to a minor league deal on April 22, 2019. At the time, 13 players were on New York's injured list, including four infielders. He played in 41 games with the Triple A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders of the International League, batting .294 with 10 home runs and 29 RBIs in 136 at bats. \nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nOn June 13, 2019, the Yankees traded Miller to the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for cash considerations. He took over Jay Bruce's role as the Phillies' utility player, as Bruce had become the Phillies' regular left fielder after Andrew McCutchen suffered a season-ending anterior cruciate ligament injury. Miller became a much-needed left-handed batter for the Phillies' struggling offense, going 6-for-16 with two home runs and four walks in his first appearances. Although the Phillies' season was disappointing, with an 81–81 record, Miller's two home runs in the final game of the season made him the first player in franchise history to record three multi-home run games in a nine-game span. While playing a variety of roles for the season, including third base, shortstop, and outfield, Miller batted .263 for the Phillies in 2019, with 12 home runs and 21 RBIs in 118 at bats.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nMiller signed a one-year, $2 million contract with the St. Louis Cardinals on February 12, 2020. During his stints as a free agent, the Cardinals had reached out to Miller, but had never been able to make room for him on the 40-man roster. After Jordan Hicks underwent Tommy John surgery, the Cardinals were able to accommodate the extra player. On September 1, Miller hit two home runs and recorded seven RBIs, the latter a career high, in a 16–2 game against the Cincinnati Reds. The Cardinals' 23 game hits were the highest in any MLB game that season. During the 60-game season, shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic, Miller played in 48 games for the Cardinals, hitting .232 with seven home runs and 25 RBIs in 142 at-bats.\nPhiladelphia Phillies (second stint).\nMiller signed a one-year, $3.5 million contract to return to the Phillies on February 17, 2021. Miller hit his 100th career home run on May 25, 2021, against Shawn Morimando of the Miami Marlins. On July 8, while starting at first base and batting second against the Chicago Cubs, Miller hit three home runs and collected five RBIs in the Phillies' 8–0 victory. It was the first three-home run game of Miller's career and the first by any member of the Phillies since Jayson Werth in 2008. On July 29, Miller capped off a Phillies comeback with a walk-off grand slam against the Washington Nationals, bringing the final score to 11–8. It was the first time that Philadelphia had mounted a victory after starting a game with a deficit of seven or more runs since 2010. In 140 games and 331 at bats for the Phillies, Miller batted .227 for the season, with 20 home runs and 49 RBIs. He became a free agent at the end of the season.\nTexas Rangers.\nOn March 17, 2022, Miller signed a two-year $10 million contract with the Texas Rangers. In 81 games for the Rangers, he batted .212/.270/.320 with 7 home runs and 32 RBI.\nIn 2023, Miller missed a chunk of the season with an oblique injury, hitting .214 with 1 home run and 6 RBI in only 27 games before he returned to the injured list with a left hamstring strain on August 2, 2023. He was transferred to the 60–day injured list on September 8, ending his regular season.\nSan Diego Padres.\nOn March 5, 2024, Miller signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres that included an invitation to spring training. He was released on March 13.\nPlayer profile.\nAlthough he has played in various positions throughout his major league career, Miller has always preferred playing shortstop. He told the \"Tampa Bay Times\" in 2015, \"Obviously in this game you want to give yourself all the opportunities and do whatever is asked of you. But I'm a shortstop, and I know where I want to be on the field.\" When playing for AL teams, Miller has also seen time as a designated hitter. He told the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" in 2020 that \"the industry views me as more of a bat\", and that his defensive abilities have come under criticism. When playing defensively, Miller uses three different baseball gloves, as well as a first baseman's mitt given to him by Paul Goldschmidt, depending on what role he is expected to play.\nPersonal life.\nMiller is a bamboo aficionado. He keeps several bamboo plants in his Florida home, saying that the plants are low-maintenance enough to maintain with a baseball schedule. In June 2019, he purchased a \"lucky bamboo plant\" from a shop in Philadelphia's Chinatown, which he believed helped break the Phillies' seven-game losing streak."

        "text": ", known in Europe as Everybody's Golf, in Australia as Everybody's Golf: World Invitational, and in North America as Hot Shots Golf: World Invitational, is the eleventh game in the \"Everybody's Golf\" series.\nThe game was unveiled along with its console, the PlayStation Vita, at the 2011 \"PlayStation Meeting\". \"Everybody's Golf\" features all-new courses, and downloadable content is available through both retail and the PlayStation Store. Players are able to leave each other comments through the \"Live Area\" system, and view the golf course using PlayStation Vita's augmented reality feature.\nA PlayStation 3 port later appeared with additional changes to the gameplay adding in support for cross platform play and PlayStation Move. Outside of Asia, this port was released exclusively on the PlayStation Store. The DLC that was on the Vita version was free at launch. The PlayStation 3 version also adds two new modes, \"Slot Mode\" and \"Minna no Short Course\". Slot Mode gives players certain advantages that are won via slots. Minna no Short Course puts players on courses that consists exclusively of short holes. The game brought two courses back from previous games such as Mt. Sakura C.C. and Northern Fox C.C.\nReception.\nThe Vita version received \"generally favourable reviews\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Critics praised the game, with \"PlayStation LifeStyle\" calling it \"an outstanding game, bursting with fun, and enjoyable by gamers of all demographics\" in its review. Simon Parkin of \"Eurogamer\" wrote: \"\"Everybody's Golf\" will never stand centre stage in the Vita's launch line-up. But in truth, it's one of the strongest launch titles, offering taut fun and challenge in a rapid-fire, quick-load manner that's perfectly suited to the handheld\". In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of one ten, one nine, one ten, and one nine for a total of 38 out of 40.\nMark Langshaw of \"Digital Spy\" gave the Vita version four stars out of five, saying: \"The game does what the series has excelled at since day one, provide an accessible golfing experience that anyone can enjoy. Unlike some of the other titles in the Sony platform's library, this one doesn't rely on gimmicks. Its focus is solid gameplay, depth and charm, and it has these things down to a tee\". Armando Rodriguez of \"411Mania\" gave it a score of 7.9 out of 10, calling it \"a solid entry in the series. Great graphics, fun (if frustrating) gameplay, great online options and a ton of stuff to unlock make it a worthy purchase. Just be prepared to endure some frustrating moments!\" However, Roger Hargreaves of \"Metro\" gave it seven out of ten, saying: \"It may not offer any surprises, but with a mountain of modes, options and unlockables this amiable golf sim is another excellent showcase for the PS Vita\".\nThe game was the best-selling Vita game in Japan at launch time."

        "text": "Mark August Helfrich (born October 28, 1973) is an American former football coach who is an analyst for Fox Sports. He was the head coach for the University of Oregon from 2013 to 2016. He most recently served as the offensive coordinator of the Chicago Bears from 2018 to 2019. He played professionally in the Austrian Football League (AFL).\nPlaying career.\nRecruited out of Marshfield High School in Coos Bay, Oregon, Helfrich was offered an opportunity to walk on at the University of Oregon; however, he decided to attend Southern Oregon instead, where he was the starting quarterback from 1992 to 1995 and was a NAIA All-American. Helfrich saw his most successful season in 1993 as he set school records for passing yards, touchdowns, and total offense. \nIn the winter and spring of 1997, he played quarterback professionally, while also serving as assistant offensive coordinator in Europe for the Vienna Austria Vikings. The Vikings reached the Austrian Football League semi finals that season. \nCoaching career.\nEarly coaching years.\nInitially starting graduate school with his sights set on becoming an orthopedic surgeon, Helfrich's coaching career ignited at Oregon as a graduate assistant working closely under then offensive coordinator, Dirk Koetter. When Koetter was hired as head coach at Boise State in 1998, the 24-year-old Helfrich went with him as the quarterbacks coach. At Boise State Helfrich coached Broncos quarterback Bart Hendricks. Under Helfrich's development, Hendricks won Big West Conference Player of the Year in 1999 and 2000 and guided the Broncos to the fourth best passing offense in the nation in 2000.\nHelfrich followed Koetter to Arizona State when Koetter became the head coach of the Sun Devils. Under the coaching of Helfrich, Andrew Walter broke nearly every Arizona State passing record and John Elway's Pac-10 touchdown record. Walter would go on to be drafted in the third round of the 2005 NFL Draft. Dirk Koetter would later praise Helfrich for his coaching abilities, \"He can do it all in his head. He doesn't have to draw the pictures on the board (…) not many people can do that. He sees the game through the quarterback's eyes. We all have ideas, but if your quarterback can't execute those ideas, they are lines on a paper. Mark is as smart a football guy as I know.\"\nIn 2006, Helfrich joined the Colorado staff to become the youngest offensive coordinator in college football on the BCS level at the age of 32. His three seasons at Colorado were a challenge as he developed the Buffaloes dismal offense into a modest improvement. After the 2006 season, Mike Bellotti contacted Helfrich about possibly joining Oregon, but Helfrich declined to leave Colorado after only one season; Chip Kelly was hired instead. Two years later, Helfrich was named Oregon's offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach, replacing Chip Kelly after he was promoted to head coach.\nOregon.\nOffensive coordinator (2009–2012).\nDuring Helfrich's four seasons as Oregon's offensive coordinator the offense ranked highly nationally in several offensive categories and became well known for their extremely fast-paced offense built around speed. Although Chip Kelly called the plays on offense, Helfrich still played an integral role in Oregon's system. He had a large amount of involvement in the game planning, scripting, and coaching on a weekly basis while having a high amount of input in what plays are called and why they are called.\nKelly spoke highly of his protégé, \"He's really, really smart and has great people skills. Sometimes, smart people can't get their point across, but he's a great communicator. When I hire people, I want to hire very, very smart people. I wanted somebody who came from a different system. I didn't want a yes-man. I wanted someone who would bring new ideas to our system.\"\nWith Helfrich coordinating under Chip Kelly, the Ducks played in four straight BCS bowls from 2009 to 2012, won three straight Pac-12 Conference championships, and continuously energized college football with one of the nation's best offenses in scoring, rushing, and total offense in each of those four seasons. As offensive coordinator during the Kelly era, the offense averaged 44.7 points per game with an average of 283.4 rushing yards and an average of 500.7 yards of total offense. Oregon's offense in 2012 was hailed as its best ever as they averaged 49.6 points per game with an average of 537.4 yards of total offense with 315.2 of those yards per game from rushing.\nAs quarterbacks coach, Helfrich was instrumental in the development of the quarterbacks that played under his tutelage at Oregon. In 2009, Jeremiah Masoli's leadership improved as he led Oregon to the 2010 Rose Bowl. The following season sophomore Darron Thomas guided an undefeated Oregon team to the 2011 BCS National Championship Game. Thomas finished his career 23–3 as a starter with a school-record 66 touchdown passes and led the Ducks to a 45–38 victory over #10 Wisconsin in the 2012 Rose Bowl. The 2012 season showcased Marcus Mariota as the first freshman to start a season opener for the Ducks in 22 seasons. He led the Ducks to a 12–1 record while being named All-Pac-12 Conference First Team, Pac-12 Freshman Offensive Player of the Year, and winning the 2013 Fiesta Bowl Offensive MVP Award as he guided the Ducks to a 35–17 victory over #5 Kansas State.\nHelfrich was recognized for his impact on the Ducks' offensive success as he was named by FootballScoop as its National Quarterbacks Coach of the Year in 2010 and 2012, in addition to being one of three finalists as its national offensive coordinator of the year honor.\nRumors of Chip Kelly's departure from college football for the NFL were constant during his tenure as Oregon's coach. Kelly refused to accept the Tampa Bay Buccaneers offer as head coach weeks after the 2012 Rose Bowl victory because he couldn't get a promise from Oregon athletic director Rob Mullens assuring him that Helfrich would be his successor. When Kelly began to interview for numerous NFL head coaching positions after Oregon's 2013 Fiesta Bowl victory, it was rumored that a succession plan was put into place for Helfrich to be the next head coach of the Ducks if Kelly were to ever leave. On January 16, 2013, Kelly left Oregon to become the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles.\nHead coach (2013–2016).\nOn January 20, 2013, Helfrich accepted the offer from the University of Oregon to become the head coach of the Ducks. As the successor to Chip Kelly, Helfrich's promotion continued an Oregon tradition that would later end when Helfrich was fired after the 2016 season. He was the third consecutive Oregon offensive coordinator promoted to head coach. Before Kelly replaced Mike Bellotti in 2009, Bellotti succeeded Rich Brooks in 1995. Since Brooks' hire in 1977, Helfrich was just the fourth head coach at Oregon. The first Oregon native to become head coach of the Ducks since 1942, Helfrich described coaching at the University of Oregon as being the pinnacle of his career.\n2013 season.\nIn his first season as head coach, Helfrich had the task of trying to emerge from the shadow of Chip Kelly. He departed from his predecessor's \"blur\" offense and implemented a more balanced attack that included a skilled passing game, resulting in an efficient offense that continued to score points and break offensive records.\nDespite finishing with an 11–2 record and a top-ten final season ranking, Helfrich's first season leading the Ducks was considered a letdown. Losses to #6 Stanford and unranked Arizona (Oregon's first loss to an unranked opponent since 2008) kept the Ducks from reaching a fifth-consecutive BCS bowl berth. Helfrich did, however, lead his team to victory over Texas in the 2013 Alamo Bowl, dominating the Longhorns 30–7 in Mack Brown's final game as Texas head coach.\n2014 season.\nIn Helfrich's second season, the Ducks won a school-record 13 games and reached the inaugural College Football Playoff National Championship. Quarterback Marcus Mariota became the first Oregon player to win the Heisman Trophy.\nThe season began with Oregon defeating No. 7 Michigan State, 46–27, ending the defending Big Ten and Rose Bowl-champion Spartans 11-game winning streak. After defeating No. 8 Arizona, 51–13, in the 2014 Pac-12 Football Championship Game, the Ducks played in the inaugural College Football Playoff, where they defeated the No. 3 Florida State Seminoles, 59–20, in the Playoff Semifinal Rose Bowl Game and ended the defending national champions 29-game winning streak. Oregon advanced to the College Football Championship Game against the Ohio State Buckeyes and lost, 42–20.\nThe Ducks finished the season with an overall 13–2 record and the No. 2 ranking in the final polls for the third time in program history. It was announced on February 9, 2015, that Helfrich had signed a five-year contract extension worth $17.5 million.\n2015 season.\nHelfrich's third season began and ended with historic losses. The Ducks early-season 42-point loss to Utah came with a total of 62 points allowed, the most points ever given up by the Ducks at home in Autzen Stadium. After a 3–3 start, Oregon fell out of the top 25 poll rankings for the first time since 2009 and started the season with two losses in September for the first time in 11 years.\nDespite the rough start, Helfrich's team bounced back to win six straight games. Following back-to-back victories over #7 Stanford and #22 USC, the Ducks were selected to play No. 11 TCU in the Alamo Bowl.\nThe Ducks dominated TCU in the first half of the Alamo Bowl by scoring at will on consecutive drives and led 31–0 at halftime. However, Oregon's offense and defense collapsed in the second half after losing starting quarterback Vernon Adams Jr. to a head injury. TCU scored on every second-half possession and rallied for the biggest comeback in college football bowl game history to beat Oregon, 47–41, in triple overtime.\nFor the first time since 2007 the Ducks failed to win 10 games and finished with a 9–4 overall record. Following the Alamo Bowl loss, Helfrich demoted defensive coordinator Don Pellum to linebackers coach after Oregon's defense regressed to finish last in the Pac-12 in total defense and ranked 93rd or worse nationally in eight defensive categories.\n2016 season.\nPrior to the season, Helfrich made multiple adjustments to his coaching staff. After Scott Frost resigned as offensive coordinator in order to become the head coach at UCF in early December 2015, Helfrich promoted wide receivers coach and passing game coordinator Matt Lubick to offensive coordinator in early January 2016. Following the Alamo Bowl loss, Don Pellum was demoted to linebackers coach, replacing Erik Chinander, who left to become the defensive coordinator for Frost at UCF. In mid-January 2016, David Yost was hired as Oregon's passing game coordinator and quarterbacks coach. Replacing Pellum as defensive coordinator was former Michigan head football coach Brady Hoke, who was hired on January 16.\nHelfrich and Oregon agreed to part ways on November 29, 2016 following a 4–8 season, Oregon's worst record in 25 years and first losing season since 2004. It also saw the first non-sellout crowds at Autzen Stadium since 2002.\nChicago Bears.\nOn January 12, 2018, Helfrich was hired by the Chicago Bears to serve as the offensive coordinator.\nAlthough Helfrich was not the play-caller, the Bears ended the 2019 season with the 29th-ranked offense and an 8–8 record. He was fired two days after the season.\nBroadcasting career.\nAfter departing from Oregon, Helfrich spent the 2017 season as an analyst for Fox Sports. He joined Fox Sports again in 2020 after his termination from the Bears coaching staff."

These are called (-2,-1,0,1,2), with negative numbers belonging to player 1, positive to player 2. At start, the ball is at the centre line (0).\nBoth players start with the same initial number (e.g. 50 points). In each draw, both players choose a number, and the ball is moved towards the player with the smallest number. The number chosen reduces the points for the next draws. The aim of the game is to move the ball beyond the second field of the opponent. The game is described in \"Das große Buch der Block- und Bleistiftspiele\".\nMathematical description.\nFor a simple description, we include the numbers -3 and 3 to denote the ball being beyond the second field. \nThis results in a playfield as (-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3).\nThe draw of player i at time t will be denoted as formula_1, the ball is at time t in formula_2.\nAt start is formula_3 and for both players is formula_4.\nEach player chooses a whole number formula_5, with formula_6 only if formula_7.\nThe number reduces the points of this player (formula_8).\nThe ball is moved as follows:\nFor the result of the game, the following rules apply:\nExample games.\nIn the first example, player one wins, but the ball is still on the playfield when both players do not have any points left.\nIn the second example, player 1 wins again, by hitting the ball beyond the other playfield using the last points he has left."

        "title": "Afghan cricket team against Pakistan in the UAE in 2011–12",
        "text": "The Afghanistan national cricket team played a single One Day International (ODI) cricket match against the Pakistan national cricket team on 10 February 2012. The match took place at a time when Pakistan were due to play England in a follow-up ODI series in the UAE after defeating them 3–0 in a Test series.\nHeld at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium in the United Arab Emirates, it was the first time that the Pakistani cricket team had faced Afghanistan in a formal international-level cricket series. This was the first time Afghanistan played against a Test-playing nation and a Full Member of the International Cricket Council in an ODI, since achieving their own ODI status at the 2009 Cricket World Cup Qualifier.\nAfghanistan batted first after winning the toss, posting a modest total of 195 after being bowled out in the 49th over. Pakistan reached their target comfortably by seven wickets with thirteen overs to spare. The match was seen as significant for Afghanistan, who had made rapid progress in international cricket over the preceding five years, as well as politically, with Afghanistan and Pakistan sharing a tense relationship between the neighboring countries.\nBackground.\nAn article published in the \"Indian Express\" described the match as one that would be one of cricket's \"famous rivalries\", noting the unstable and often tense political relations between the two neighboring countries as well as the complex historical, geographical and cultural links between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Sharjah cricket stadium is famous for having previously hosted many cricket duels between arch-rivals India and Pakistan and the intense atmosphere surrounding this latest contest brings the ground back into the spotlight again. Many Afghan cricketers grew up and learnt cricket while living as refugees in Pakistan. Afghan fast bowler Hamid Hassan, who himself had been ruled out of the match through injury, said that the entire country was eagerly counting down to the big game with Pakistan, while all-rounder Mohammad Nabi added that the opportunity to play against a top team like Pakistan was a dream come true.\nWith Afghanistan lacking international standard playing facilities, and with ongoing security problems in Afghanistan, the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates has been Afghanistan's adopted 'home' ground since February 2010. Acknowledging the remarkable significance of the game for Afghan cricket, a local ground official expected the stadium to entertain a full house of spectators on the day, consisting especially of Afghan expatriates.\nThe only other occasion in which the Afghan cricket team has faced Pakistan at the world stage was at a semi-final of the 2010 Asian Games, a match which they went on to win. The defeated Pakistani team at the tournament was a second-string domestic outfit and had almost no international players. This one-day international is hence the first occasion in which Afghanistan are to compete against the proper Pakistani national team. The match was also significant for being the first time that an Affiliate Member of the International Cricket Council has played a Full Member Test-playing nation.\nOmar Zakhilwal, president of the Afghanistan Cricket Board, told reporters that cricket had become the most widely played game in Afghanistan and that the match was such a big milestone for the country that even the once cricket-hating Taliban sent a message of support to the Afghan team.\nMatch.\nReport.\nAfghan innings.\nUnder a cloudless late afternoon sky at Sharjah, full to capacity with 14,000 spectators, Afghanistan captain Nawroz Mangal won the toss and elected to bat on a wicket which favoured batting. The opening pair of Karim Sadiq and Noor Ali Zadran started brightly, with Sadiq scoring the first boundary of the innings from the fourth ball with a flick off Umar Gul. Zadran was dismissed midway through the fifth over, caught and bowled by Gul for 9. Wicket-keeper Mohammad Shahzad joined Sadiq at the crease and the two batted aggressively against the opening bowlers of Gul and Wahab Riaz. Sadiq recorded the first six of the match in the seventh over, striking a slower ball from Gul over the long on boundary. The following over Shahzad struck Riaz for three consecutive fours, which by the end of the eighth over took Afghanistan to 47, with a run rate close to 6 runs per over. This aggressive start by the Afghan batsman against the opening bowlers prompted Pakistani captain Misbah-ul-Haq to introduce spinner Saeed Ajmal early to the attack in the ninth over. The introduction of Ajmal, who had just come off the back of taking 24 wickets in Pakistans recently concluded Test series against England, didn't change the attacking mindset of Sadiq and Shahzad. The third delivery of Ajmal's first over was reverse swept for a six by Shahzad. The next over Shahid Afridi came into the attack and almost immediately dismissed Shahzad, thanks largely to a \"moment of brilliance\" in the field by Asad Shafiq, whose one-handed catch ended an entertaining stand of 31 for the second wicket. The introduction of Afridi to the attack lowered the run-rate considerably, with Afridi's variations of pace and spin leaving the Afghan batsman hesitant in their shot selection. At 71/2 in fourteenth over, Mangal mistimed a slog off Afridi, who bowled the Afghan captain for 11. He followed this up in the sixteenth by dismissing Sadiq to reduce them to 88/4. Gulbodin Naib became his fourth victim of the innings when he misread a googly and was adjudged leg before by umpire Simon Taufel. Mohammad Nabi and Samiullah Shenwari then combined to arrest the Afghan slump, through a measured but at times aggressive partnership. They added 46 runs for the sixth wicket to take the total to 147/4, however Nabi was run out for 32 from 56 balls by a combination of Khan and Mohammad Hafeez, after backing-up too far out of his crease with the score on 165. Mirwais Ashraf then became Afidi's fifth wicket of the match, while Dawlat Zadran and Shenwari took the score to 193. They soon fell and Afghanistan were all out for 195 from 48.3 overs. Karim Sadiq's 40 was the top score in the Afghan innings, while Afridi finished with figures with 5/36 from his ten overs. Gul and Riaz also chipped in with two wickets each, with Ajmal was the most economical bowler.\nPakistani innings.\nSet 196 to win under the floodlights, Pakistans innings started poorly when Hafeez was dismissed by Dawlat Zadran after edging back onto his stumps. Hafeez's opening partner Imran Farhat was then joined at the crease by Shafiq, with the two adding 33 for the second wicket. Shafiq fell for quickfire 20 from 21 balls in the tenth over to Dawlat Zadran, bowled by a \"pacy indipper\". The first ten overs, bowled entirely by Dawlat Zadran and his new ball partner Shapoor Zadran (of no relation), had conceded 42 runs, with the Pakistani run-rate at 4.20 runs per over. Spin was introduced in the eleventh, with the introduction of Ashraf. During the eleven overs that followed, no further wickets fell, while Pakistans run-rate remained around four runs per over, however by this point they only required a little over three runs per over. The spin of debutant Amir Hamza, Sadiq and Nabi, as well as the medium pace of Ashraf was used during this period of play, with the Pakistani batsman rotating the strike well and scoring the odd boundary. Farhat reached his fifty at the end of the twentieth over, though fell two overs later off the bowling of Shenwari for 52, having combined with Younis Khan to adding 57 for the third wicket, which took the score to 99/3. Khan was joined at the crease by Misbah-ul-Haq. Khan passed fifty at the end of the thirty-third over with a straight drive off Dawlat Zadran. Both batsman increased their scoring pace as they neared the target, with Misbah striking the winning runs with a reverse swept four off Nabi, to lead Pakistan home by seven wickets and with thirteen overs to spare. Khan and Misbah's unbeaten partnership was worth 99 from 93 balls, with Khan ending with 70 from 65 balls and Misbah ending with 40 runs from 55 balls. Dawlat Zadran, with figures of 2/38, was Afghanistan's most economical bowler.\nDuring the presentation ceremony that followed immediately after match, Afridi was named man of the match for his five wickets. Afridi reached two notable landmarks during his performance: He surpassed Anil Kumble's tally of 337 wickets to become the second highest wicket taker in ODIs (behind Muttiah Muralitharan's 534), while his man of the match award was his 28th in ODIs, equally Saeed Anwar's record. Speaking after the match, Afghan captain Mangal stated that he thought Afghanistan were 40 runs short of an adequate total, while also commenting that he thought Afghanistan had performed satisfactorily, stating \"This was our first-ever one-dayer against a top team and I am happy with the performance of the team\". He also thanked the Pakistan Cricket Board for giving them the opportunity to play Pakistan and requested the International Cricket Council to provide them with more matches against Full Members. Misbah, also commenting during the presentation ceremony in which he accepted the victors trophy, stated, \"I am really happy with the spirit of the Afghanistan players,\" expanding on that by commenting, \"There were times in the match when they put us on the back foot and that was expected, so we did well to win in the end.\""

        "text": "Harry Devereaux Fisher (January 3, 1926 – September 20, 1981) was a Canadian professional baseball player. Primarily a right-handed pitcher, his skill as a batter also enabled him to play outfield in minor league baseball and pinch hit at both the minor and Major League levels. He batted left-handed, stood tall and weighed (12 stone 12).\nCareer.\nFisher's professional career lasted for 12 seasons (1947–54; 1956–59). In 1949–50, with the New Orleans Pelicans of the Double-A Southern Association, Fisher batted .397 and .423 in successive seasons, although, as a pitcher (and part-time outfielder in 1950), he was well short of enough at bats (58 and 156, respectively) or plate appearances to win the SA batting championship.\nHe appeared in 18 Major League games with the –52 Pittsburgh Pirates — ten as a pinch hitter and eight as a pitcher. In his first trial with the 1951 Bucs, Fisher was used exclusively in a pinch hitting role, going hitless in three at bats. In 1952, he began the season with the Hollywood Stars of the Open-Classification Pacific Coast League until his recall by the Pirates. In his first game back with them, on June 21, he got his first Major League hit, a pinch single off Carl Erskine of the Brooklyn Dodgers at Ebbets Field. He would pinch hit three more times until he took the mound July 2 for his first MLB pitching assignment; in relief of Ron Kline, he allowed no runs and two hits in two innings of work in a 3–0 Pittsburgh defeat at the hands of the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. Two days later, on July 4 at Crosley Field, Fisher got his first starting assignment in the Majors, and he defeated the Cincinnati Reds 5–2 for his only big league victory. Fisher worked six innings and scattered five hits, allowing two earned runs, and left the game with the lead, 3–2.\nFisher made ten more appearances for the Pirates that season, six as a pitcher, losing his last two starts to the Boston Braves on July 13 and New York Giants on August 1. Returning to minor league baseball, he played through 1959 (sitting out the 1955 season), gradually logging more time in the outfield to take advantage of his batting prowess.\nAs a Major Leaguer, he gave up 17 hits and 13 bases on balls in innings pitched, recording five strikeouts. As a batter, he hit .278; his five MLB hits included one double and he had one run batted in."

Each nation's top ranked player was joined by the second highest player of that country. For seeding the average rankings of the players was used, with the top 8 nations automatically starting in round 2 and the other 16 nations starting in round 1.\nThe round 1 matches were shortened from best of 11 to best of 9 legs in doubles compared to 2010. The winners of round 1 played one of the top eight ranked teams in round 2, and it used the same format as the group stage in 2010, except that the sets were increased from best of 5 to best of 7 legs for singles and best of 9 legs for doubles matches. Two singles matches and a doubles match, with 1 point awarded for a singles win and 2 points awarded for a doubles win. If the match score was 2–2 at the end of the match, then a sudden-death doubles leg decided who got through. The fixtures remained the same, the top ranked player in the country faced the second highest ranked player in the country. Another change have seen the winners of round 2 qualify for the quarter-finals, which replaced the group stage. The quarter-finals used the same format as round 2, except that the doubles matches were best of 7 legs. The semi-finals and final used the same format used in 2010, except that the sets were reduced from best of 11 to best of 7 and from best of 15 to best of 13 respectively.\nTeams and seeding.\nFive teams made their debut in the 2012 World Cup. South Africa became the first African team to participate, they were joined by Croatia, Hungary, Malaysia and the Philippines.

        "text": "The Old Dominion–VCU men's basketball rivalry is a men's college basketball rivalry between the VCU Rams of Virginia Commonwealth University and the Old Dominion Monarchs of Old Dominion University. This rivalry is said to be one of the most competitive among middle level Division-I basketball programs.\nBackground.\nThe rivalry between Virginia Commonwealth University and Old Dominion University exists primarily because of the similar histories of the two Virginia public universities. Both schools have historic affiliations with The College of William &amp; Mary (W&amp;M). One of VCU's predecessor institutions, the Richmond Professional Institute (RPI), became part of W&amp;M in 1925. ODU was founded in 1930 as the Norfolk Division of W&amp;M. In addition, from 1960 to 1962, both RPI and the Norfolk Division were part of The Colleges of William &amp; Mary, a short-lived university system consisting of W&amp;M and its affiliated institutions.\nVCU, located in the state capital of Richmond, is just 90 miles down Interstate 64 from ODU, located in Norfolk. Both schools are major research universities located in an urban environment. They are also both very large universities consisting of a diverse student body; with students primarily coming from middle-class backgrounds.\nThroughout much of the history of the rivalry, ODU and VCU had been in the same conference, most recently the Colonial Athletic Association. This ended after the 2011–12 season when VCU joined the Atlantic 10 Conference. ODU left the CAA for Conference USA a year later.\nRick Kiefner, a 1969 graduate of ODU, believed the animosity and rivalry may have started due to an incident during the 1970 season. A group of ODU fans, including Kiefner, had chartered a bus to travel to a VCU game in Richmond, but, instead of the tickets they had paid for, received a box of screws in the mail."

Chamberlain was pitching for Harwich in the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL) in the summer of 1932 when he was noticed by a White Sox scout. He was playing in Chicago by the end of the season.\nIn his only major league campaign, Chamberlain appeared in 12 games for the 1932 White Sox, posting a 4.57 ERA in 41.1 innings. He gave up three big league home runs, two to Baseball Hall of Famer Mickey Cochrane, and one that was the 200th home run of Hall of Famer Al Simmons' illustrious career. Perhaps Chamberlain's most memorable outing came on August 29 in the second game of a doubleheader against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium. In a 4-3 White Sox loss, Chamberlain held Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig hitless over five innings, and helped his own cause with a single off Hall of Fame hurler Red Ruffing.\nChamberlain continued to play professionally in the minor leagues through 1938. While serving a one-month suspension from the New York–Pennsylvania League in 1937, he returned to play again for the CCBL's Harwich club. After his baseball career had ended, Chamberlain spent 30 years with the Boston Police Department, retiring in 1970."

        "title": "Skeleton Canyon shootout",
        "text": "The Skeleton Canyon shootout was a gunfight on August 12, 1896, between members of the High Five Gang and a posse of American lawmen. Following a failed robbery on August 1 of the bank in Nogales, Arizona, the High Fives headed east and split up. The gang's leader, Black Jack Christian, and George Musgrave got away.\nThree others, including Bob Christian, were engaged by the posse at the entrance of Skeleton Canyon. This gorge in the Peloncillo Mountains had historically been used by smugglers, bandits, and legitimate travelers between the United States and Mexico. The outlaws fought off their pursuers, killing Frank Robson, and escaped into New Mexico Territory.\nPursuit continued through the month, as Black Jack and Musgrave surfaced in other areas, as did the other three. Other men joined the posse, and the United States Marshal of New Mexico Territory acquired aid from United States Army forces already in the area for the Apache Campaign in the Peloncillos. The pursuers did not catch up with the bandits for many months.\nBackground.\nBlack Jack Christian and his older brother Bob were leaders of the outlaw High Five Gang, but at least six other men rode with them at times, including Bob Hayes, George West Musgrave, Van Musgrave, Code Young, Sid Moore, and \"Three Fingered\" Jack Dunlop. After working as cowboys in Arizona, on July 20, 1896, the High Fives held up a general store in Separ, New Mexico. They made off with around $200 and some merchandise, trading some of their loot to local ranchers for food and lodging.\nBy August 1, 1896, the High Fives were holed up on the Babocomari grant, in the San Pedro Valley north of Fort Huachuca, Arizona. Together with Ed Roberts, a wealthy rancher and associate of Musgrave, they planned to rob the International Bank of Nogales in Arizona, located near the international border. Roberts was to arrange to withdraw $10,000 in specie and bills, purportedly to pay the unpopular tariff for importing some Mexican cattle. But, Roberts intended to have the High Fives steal the money.\nThe bank was in a two-story building that also held stores for groceries and hardware. On August 6, the clerks in the bank prepared the cash and coins for Roberts' large withdrawal, scheduled to take place at 1:00 pm. The bank's president, John Dessart, had the money taken out of the vault and stacked on the counter in preparation.\nSometime after 12:00 pm, the High Fives entered town, riding next to the railroad down Morley Avenue and toward the bank. At lunchtime, it was quiet. Black Jack, George Musgrave, and Bob Hayes dismounted and went inside, while Bob Christian and Code Young remained outside to watch the horses. Another source says that Three Fingered Jack was the fifth man in the robbery, rather than Code Young.\nInside the bank, the cashier, Major Fred Herrera, sat behind the counter while John Dessart stood at a desk working on balances. Hayes covered the cashier, Black Jack watched Dessart, and Musgrave moved behind the counter with a sack for the loot. Herrera handed stacks of cash over the counter to Dessart, who filled the bag. Musgrave walked to the rear to check it out. Through a double door, he saw four men meeting in the bank's parlor; Morgan R. Wise, a consular agent; W.L. Campbell of Calabasas, Robert Ekey, a Santa Cruz County rancher; and Judge Ed Williams, Ekey's attorney. About then, Major A.O. Brummel entered the bank to join the meeting; Musgrave seized him and moved him toward the back, but this activity distracted Black Jack, and Dessart ran out the front door.\nBlack Jack struck and wounded Dessart in the head with his rifle, but the president reached the exterior, running and calling to Herry Lewis on the street, to telephone the police. Black Jack threatened Lewis with his pistol and prevented him from calling anyone.\nDistracted, Musgrave and Hayes lost control of the men in the parlor, and the five escaped out the back door of the bank. Major Fred Herrera got his pistol from under the counter and fired it at Hayes. Running through the front door, Hayes bumped into Black Jack. Herrera also shot at Musgrave, hitting him in the knee as he ran out the back. The bandit passed through the hardware store to join his gang in front. As they mounted up, Frank King, a deputy customs inspector, opened fire from across the street, wounding both Musgrave's and Black Jack's horses. Black Jack pulled Musgrave up behind him, and the High Fives took off on four horses, with Musgrave's riderless horse trailing closely.\nAs they passed the Montezuma Hotel, a Treasury Department inspector named Ben E. Hambleton grabbed a rifle and mounted a horse to pursue. Passing the Nogales Electric, Light, Ice and Water Company building, the gang was fired on by two employees. At the end of town, they were fired on by two other Nogales residents. The \"bullet marks scarred much of downtown Nogales,\" but the only fatalities were animals: a horse hit by Black Jack and a mule by Major Herrera.\nDiego Ramirez of Nogales said that the High Fives made off with $40,000; however, Johnny Clarke, the son of a posse member who pursued the outlaws to Skeleton Canyon, said that \"it was never known if they got away with the money or not.\" According to the Tanners, the gang did not gain $40,000, or even the $10,000 that was arranged. The newspapers of both Nogales, Arizona, and Nogales, Mexico reported that \"not a cent was lost.\"\nJust outside town, the outlaws rode east up Beck Canyon, where they split up. Black Jack and Musgrave went to Ed Roberts' ranch, located on the upper San Pedro River. Bob Christian, Bob Hayes and Code Young crossed the border into Sonora, near the San Antonio Pass in the Patagonia Mountains. They were pursued by a posse from Nogales, led by Customs Collector Samuel F. Webb, but the lawmen eventually abandoned the pursuit several days later on August 8. From the border town of Lochiel, the posse had traveled fifteen miles into Sonora, but finally had to turn back because they lacked fresh mounts.\nPosse pursuit and shootout.\nWhen news of the robbery reached Tucson, Pima County Sheriff Robert N. Leatherwood went to Bisbee, closer to the border, and organized another posse. It included deputies Broderick and Doyle, Deputy US Marshal Al Ezekiels, two customs inspectors, Samuel Webb and Miller; the noted Wells Fargo agent Jeff Milton, and Billy Stiles, then a lawman but a future bandit. From Bisbee, the posse followed the High Fives' trail to where they split. At the border, Ezekiels went south with a few men, while Leatherwood followed Black Jack's trail with the main posse.\nWhile in Mexico, Ezekiels' posse cooperated with the Gendarmería Fiscal, commanded by General Juan Fenochio. They caught up with Bob Christian, Bob Hayes and Code Young at a place called La Cuerva, but the three got away and back over the border to the US. On the morning of August 11, Sheriff Fly, and deputies Bill Hildreth, Burt Alvord and Will Johnson left Bisbee and headed east across the San Simon Valley to join up with Leatherwood. By that time, Ezekiels' posse had returned from Mexico and was also riding to rejoin Leatherwood. When Ezekiels and his men were near Mulberry Wash in San Simon Valley, Jeff Milton sighted the three bandits and wanted to engage them, but Ezekiels refused to go any further toward Mexico.\nMilton later recalled:\nWe saw these fellows and we saw them coming out of the mulberry pasture. I says Damned if they ain't them, and the fellow in charge [Ezekiels] of them others they couldn't go. He says 'We'll run them out of the country.' And I says' that is what we want to do.' But he just quit. That was on the south end of the Chiricahuas.(sic)\nAfter they abandoned the chase, Ezekiels' posse camped overnight in Leslie Canyon, located on the ranch of Si Bryant near the remains of Fort Rucker. On the next morning, Milton, Stiles, a man named Randolph, and Felix Mayhew left Ezekiels; they rode north through Dos Cabezas Canyon to board a train heading to Tucson. There they would get fresh horses and rejoin the pursuit.\nBut, the first phase of pursuit ended the same day, when Leatherwood and his forces reached Skeleton Canyon. Milton later said: \"I never run on to Black Jack and I'm glad I didn't. I might have got hurt. (sic)\" Skeleton Canyon is a rugged pass leading through the Peloncillos, which connects the San Simon Valley of Arizona with the Animas Valley of New Mexico. It was a well-known haven for outlaws, who used it as a fortress on more than one occasion.\nAt about 12:00 pm on August 12, Leatherwood's posse was riding across the valley, along Skeleton Creek, when they spotted a lone bandit ahead of them. Deputy Doyle went after the man, but, as he was riding up a steep hill, he fell off his horse, injured his knee, and broke his weapon. Unable to continue, Doyle left the posse to go to Deming.\nLeatherwood, Fly, Alvord, Hildreth, Johnson, and Inspector Frank Robson stayed on the trail. At about 4:00 pm, Leatherwood and his men were near the entrance of Skeleton Canyon when suddenly \"shots exploded from the underbrush seventy-five feet in front of the advancing lawmen.\" Riding near the front, Robson was hit twice in the first volley, both in the head, as Leatherwood and the others jumped off their horses. Robson fell dead instantly as the remaining possemen returned the fire, killing one of the bandits' horses.\nUnder fire, Leatherwood retreated while his horse and those of Alvord and Robson ran off toward the High Fives. One of the outlaws seized Leatherwood's horse, but it was later reported to have been shot and killed during the fight. The High Fives directed their fire at Deputy Hildreth, who was slightly wounded in the neck, and they shot and killed his horse.\nJeff Milton later recalled an account he was told of the gunfight:\nBill Hildreth got in behind a tree and they [the High Fives] were shooting and the bullets would knock the bark off on one side and then the other. And old Bob [Leatherwood] told me himself, said, 'Milton, did I run? I had one of these old long barrel rifles and I used it for a jumping stick,' when they got to shooting at him. Old Bill was the only one left then and was smoking them [the High Fives]. Do you know, I can't understand how a man can shoot at a fellow six or seven times and don't kill him. I don't understand. When old Bill got a chance to run-they [the High Fives] were shooting both sides of the treehe got out. He remembered this fellow [Robson] and went back and got him.\nWalter C. Hovey, a confidant of the gang, later said that Hildreth had tried to join the gang, which is why they retaliated by trying to kill him when he showed up with the posse. \"Bisbee Orb\" commented: \"Hildreth was acting as a guide for the officers having been driving cattle in that county for years and knows all the water holes and places in the vicinity. The robbers knowing this and being acquainted with Hildreth desired to get rid of him.\"\nThe gunfight lasted until sundown and by the time it ended, the bandits had reached Robson's body. They stole his rifle, revolver, and watch before mounting up to escape into the Animas Valley. After realizing the High Fives had departed, the posse buried Robson in an unmarked grave and retreated.\nAftermath.\nThe day after the Skeleton Canyon shootout, sheriffs Fly and Leatherwood telegraphed Tombstone: \"They got two of our horses, we two of theirs. Think we wounded two, not certain, as they were concealed.\" There is no evidence that any of the three bandits were wounded. On August 14, Burt Alvord returned to Tombstone; he said none of the posse could even see the outlaws during the fighting. He explained they had buried Robson because the terrain was rough, the posse lost three of their horses, and they didn't have a wagon to transport the body. That same day, John Horton Slaughter, the former Cochise County sheriff; Bert Cogswell, William King, and two Mexican men, joined Leatherwood's posse, somewhere around Mulberry Ranch in western San Simon Valley, where they were resting their horses.\nImmediately after the shootout, gang members Bob Christian, Hayes and Young rode to the Gray Ranch, near Victoria, New Mexico, and robbed the place for supplies. On the following night, the three bandits were spotted in the mountains near the Diamond A Ranch by Tom Horn, the chief of the United States Army Apache Scouts. Since he was riding alone, searching for renegade Apache, he took no action other than reporting the sighting when he returned to Fort Grant on August 28. Meanwhile, Black Jack and Musgrave, who had avoided Skeleton Canyon, were hiding somewhere in San Simon Valley. On the night of the shootout, the two raided a horse ranch belonging to the San Simon Cattle Company. Black Jack robbed the ranch hands, forced them to serve dinner, and took two fresh horses to use.\nBlack Jack and Musgrave showed up at the Mulberry Ranch on August 18, four days after Leatherwood and his posse rested there. They robbed the place and demanded dinner. Some time later, Black Jack and Musgrave came across Robert Hill and Will Pomeroy. Hill was Frank Robson's brother-in-law and was heading to Skeleton Canyon to exhume Robson's body for reburial in Mesa. Saying they were not involved in the skirmish, Black Jack and Musgrave told Hill they liked Robson and expressed sympathy for his widow, offering \"financial assistance\". After that, the two outlaws headed for the Mexican border town of La Morita. Another posse tracked them there, but the trail eventually turned back into Arizona and was lost.\nAlthough the High Fives had been seen outside the Peloncillo Mountains, Edward L. Hall, the United States Marshal of New Mexico Territory, sent his chief deputy and brother-in-law, Horace W. Loomis, into the area in order to join Leatherwood's posse. On August 24, Loomis telegraphed Hall, saying that the \"robbers were encamped behind breast-works of a formidable nature and had stood off the deputies [Leatherwoods posse] so successfully that a considerable force of men would be necessary to dislodge them.\" In response to Loomis' message, Hall telegraphed the Justice Department and requested help from the 7th Cavalry soldiers at Fort Bayard, New Mexico. Engaged in the Apache Campaign to clear the Peloncillos of renegades, the army was willing to assist the roving posses in their hunt for the five bandits. It took months before they had success."

The popularity of American football in the nation has grown substantially since 2010, becoming a major source of talent to the National Football League (NFL). The Nigerian Institute of American Football (NAIF) was the governing body for international American football in Nigeria under the broader International Federation of American Football (IFAF) for Africa until 2019, when the American Football Association of Nigeria (NAFA) took its place.\nNAIF history.\nThe institute was founded in June 2011 in Zaria, Nigeria in cooperation with Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) by American former athletes Daryl Hayes, Ricardo Dickerson, and Gregory Hendricks with help from Nigerian athlete Ejike Ugboaja in an effort to popularize American football in the nation.\nTo educate potential coaches for the sport in the nation, coaching clinics were offered to help teach the basics of the game. The ABU had announced plans to offer a Programme of Study related to coaching American Football sometime in the future.\nSince the founding of the NIAF, Nigeria has become the highest football-player-exporting country in Africa, with the \"Lagos Marines\" becoming the nation's most popular American football team. American football has also become one of the nation's top ten most streamed sports.\nFunding.\nThe majority of the NIAF's funding comes from the United States. Cash fundraising events in universities and schools and football material collection drives have mainly supplied the institute to date.\nNigerian American Football Association (NAFA).\nFounded in 2019 by Babajide Akeredolu and Oluwaseye Obatolu, NAFA aims to elevate the sport of American Football in Nigeria. Later into its journey, Lawrence Ojaide and Dominik Mueller, a German diplomat and founder of Lagos Marine, came onboard, significantly expanding NAFA's reach. Akeredolu, as a unifying leader, drives engagement and creates opportunities for stakeholders. Obatolu, the architect of NAFA's structure and ethos, shapes the organization's unique identity. Lawrence Ojaide, the on-ground dynamo and driving force on the ground, propelled NAFA's remarkable growth. Ojaide's spearheading efforts have been key in driving NAFA to success. William P. Obubo, Nneka Eze, Chuks Obiazor and Ife Omotalade played roles in the early stages but later took on less prominent positions in the development.\nFunding.\nThe majority of the NAFA's funding comes from the founders with some help from their sponsors.\nNigerian Secondary School Flag Football League (NSSFFL).\nThe NSSFFL is a league under NAFA whose goal is to promote the sport among secondary school students between the ages of 12 and 18 in the nation. The maiden league consisted of approximately 900 athletes who were part of 20 male and 20 female teams.\nNotable players.\nWith the growing popularity of American football in Nigeria, the country has produced many notable players, including more than 50 players who have gone on to play in the National Football League (NFL). Osi Umenyiora, one of the earliest Nigerians to play in the NFL, has become a leader in recruiting and mentoring Nigerian players in the NFL.\nNotable players include:"

        "text": "Nacra Sailing is a Dutch company that manufactures a line of small catamaran sailboats, or beachcats. NACRA was founded in 1975 to tap into the market created by Hobie Alter the founder of Hobie Cat, and several other companies offering small fiberglass catamarans designed to be sailed off the beach by a crew of one or two.\nNACRA is an acronym that stands for North American Catamaran Racing Association, and as the name implies, the company has remained primarily focused on racing catamarans from inception.\nHistory.\nNacra Sailing was founded by sailboat designer Tom Roland who had previously designed the Alpha Cat, an 18-foot beach cat, in 1970. After this he designed a 36-foot, oversized one design beach catamaran as part of venture to start a professional sailboat racing series. About 10 of these were built, but the racing series didn't turn out to be viable. The racing series was the original source of the NACRA acronym (North American Catamaran Racing Association), which was carried over when he decided to build a scaled down and more commercial version of his big one-design racer.\nIn 1975 he launched the new company with the Nacra 5.2, a 17-foot beach cat, which was an unusual design that featured plumb bows, daggerboards, and a highly tunable sail plan with a fully battened loose-footed main sail. Many of the design elements of this first boat were carried over to the later designs as well as becoming common on other performance oriented catamarans.\nThe company has gone through several ownership and name changes over the years, and acquired the competing Prindle brand in 1988. At that time the company operated under the name \"Performance Catamarans\" and relocated from Santa Barbara to Santa Ana, California. In 2007 the company was acquired by a group in the Netherlands and today operates as Nacra Sailing. An Australian-based licensee of Nacra Sailing has operated as NACRA Australasia since 1985 and also builds NACRA branded boats.\nNacra Sailing's 20 foot boats dominated the Worrell 1000, a race the New York Times described as \"A Tour d'France on the Water\", throughout the 1990s, and were selected as only the second one-design for the race in 2001.\nIn 2012 Nacra Sailing won the design competition held by World Sailing, the world governing body for the sport of sailing recognized by the International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee, for a new Olympic racing catamaran, the Nacra 17, which was used in the new for 2016 Olympic Mixed Multihull class, which requires one male and one female sailor per boat. In 2017 it was announced that a modified version of the boat with foiling capability will be used in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\nIn 2015 the Nacra 15 was adopted by World Sailing as a Youth World Championships class, as well as a new class for the Youth Olympic Games. In 2016 British RYA selected the Nacra 15 as their new Youth Multihull boat, as well.\nRecent catamarans built by Nacra Sailing have included rudders and daggerboards shaped to facilitate hydofoiling at higher speeds, among the first commercial sail boats to offer this feature."

Reeves appears to have known manager J. L. Wilkinson long before the All Nations team was formed, when they both toured with the Des Moines Hopkins Bros. team, the Bloomer Girls.\nIn the 1912 and 1913 seasons, Reeves often caught for Negro leaguer John Donaldson in games where the battery racked up an average of 15 strike outs per game. He also caught for Cuban Hall of Fame pitcher José Méndez, and many other well-known pitchers of the day.\nThroughout the 19-teens, Reeves was very widely known across Iowa as a \"Wrestling Champion.\" However, there were no official records kept except through newspaper accounts.\nReeves became an auctioneer in 1919, but in the 1920 Census, Reeves listed he was a farmer, renting land in the Graettinger, Iowa area. He started another baseball team in 1920, calling the team the \"Twilight Stars.\" The team changed their name to the \"Wolves\" by 1922.\nReeves continued to wrestle in the early 1920s.

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball perfect games",
        "text": "Over the 154 years of Major League Baseball history, and over 238,500 games played, there have been 24 official perfect games by the current definition. No pitcher has thrown more than one. The perfect game thrown by Don Larsen in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series is the only postseason perfect game in major league history and one of only three postseason no-hitters. The first two major league perfect games, and the only two of the premodern era, were thrown in 1880, five days apart. The frequency of perfect games has increased significantly since 1981. Fifteen perfect games were thrown in the 44 seasons from 1980 through 2023, while only nine were thrown in the 100-plus prior seasons. There were three perfect games in 2012; the only other year of the modern era in which as many as two were thrown was 2010. By contrast, there have been spans of 23 and 33 consecutive seasons in which no perfect game was thrown. Though two perfect-game bids have gone into extra innings, no extra-inning game has been completed to perfection.\nHistory.\nThe first two perfect games occurred under rules that differed in many important respects from those of today's game: in 1880, for example, only underhand pitching—from a flat, marked-out box 45 feet from home plate—was allowed, it took eight balls to draw a walk, and a batter was not awarded first base if hit by a pitch. Lee Richmond, a left-handed pitcher for the Worcester Ruby Legs, threw the first perfect game. He played professional baseball for six years and pitched full-time for only three, finishing with a losing record. The second perfect game was thrown by John Montgomery Ward for the Providence Grays. Ward, a decent pitcher who became an excellent position player, went on to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.\nThough convention has it that the modern era of Major League Baseball begins in 1900, the essential rules of the modern game were in place by the 1893 season. That year the pitching distance was moved back to 60 feet, 6 inches, where it remains, and the pitcher's box was replaced by a rubber slab against which the pitcher was required to place his rear foot. Two other crucial rules changes had been made in recent years: In 1887, the rule awarding a hit batsman first base was instituted in the National League (this had been the rule in the American Association since 1884: first by the umpire's judgment of the impact; as of the following year, virtually automatically). In 1889, the number of balls required for a walk was reduced to four. Thus, from 1893 on, perfect games occurred under fundamental rules identical to today, with three significant exceptions: counting a foul ball as a first or second strike, enforced by the National League as of 1901 and by the American League two years later, the use of the designated hitter in American League games (and interleague games played with the American League team as the home team) since the 1973 season and National League games starting with the 2022 season, and the use of the pitch clock and batter clock starting in 2023.\nPitchers.\nDuring baseball's modern era, 22 pitchers have thrown perfect games. Most were accomplished major leaguers. Seven have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame: Cy Young, Addie Joss, Jim Bunning, Sandy Koufax, Catfish Hunter, Randy Johnson, and Roy Halladay.\nDavid Cone won the Cy Young Award once, pitched a 19-strikeout game, was part of five World Series winning teams, and was named to five All-Star teams. Félix Hernández is likewise a one-time Cy Young winner, as well as a six-time All-Star. Four other perfect-game throwers, Dennis Martínez, Kenny Rogers, David Wells and Mark Buehrle, each won over 200 major league games.\nOthers include Matt Cain, a three-time All-Star, who pitched well in the postseason for two World Series–winning Giants teams. Mike Witt was a two-time All-Star who finished 3rd for the 1986 Cy Young Award, going 117–116. Tom Browning was a one-time All-Star with a career record of 123–90, and pitched for the 1990 World Series winning Cincinnati Reds.\nDon Larsen, Charlie Robertson, and Len Barker were journeyman pitchers—each finished his major-league career with a losing record; Barker made one All-Star team, Larsen none (Robertson played his entire career before the establishment of the MLB All-Star Game).\nDallas Braden retired with a 26–36 record after five seasons due to a shoulder injury. Philip Humber's perfect game was the only complete game he recorded, and his major league career, in which he went 16–23, ended the year after he threw it. Domingo German threw his perfect game following a start in which he allowed 10 runs in 3 and one-third innings.\nMajor League Baseball perfect games.\nIn what follows, the number before the letter K denotes the number of strikeouts in the game. RHP and LHP stand for right-handed pitcher and left-handed pitcher, respectively, and the number following that designation is the age of the pitcher at the time of the game.\n19th century.\nNote that the pitching rules in effect in 1880 were very different from those of the modern game. Only underhand pitching was permitted, and the batter had the right to call for the ball high, low, or \"middle\" (belt-high). There was no strike zone; whether a pitch was \"good\" or \"unfair\" was left to the umpire's sole discretion, and foul balls were not counted as strikes. The pitching distance was 45 feet (that however was the front edge of the 6-foot-deep pitcher's box, not the push-off point represented by the modern pitching rubber).\nLee Richmond.\nRichmond was pitching in his first full season in the big leagues after appearing in one game in 1879. He was apparently considered a good hitter, as he batted second in the lineup. His perfect game featured an unusual 9–3 putout, with Worcester right fielder Lon Knight throwing out Cleveland's Bill Phillips at first. The play came on one of three balls Cleveland hit out of the infield. Three outs were recorded on \"foul bounds\": balls caught after bouncing once in foul territory (the foul bound rule was eliminated three years later). In the seventh inning, the game was delayed for seven minutes due to rain; Richmond dried the ball off with sawdust when he returned to the mound. A monument marks the site of the Worcester Agricultural Fairgrounds where the game took place, located on the campus of the now-closed Becker College. The feat was recognized as unusual: a newspaper report described it as \"the most wonderful game on record\".\nJohn Montgomery Ward.\nMonte Ward threw his perfect game at the Grays' park in Providence, but Buffalo, by virtue of a coin toss, which was the custom under the rules at that time, was officially the \"home\" team, batting in the bottom of each inning. At the age of 20 years, 105 days, Ward is the youngest pitcher to throw a perfect game. He batted sixth in the lineup. Beginning in 1881, the year after his perfect game, Ward spent more time as a position player than a pitcher; in 1885, following an arm injury, he became a full-time infielder. The five days between Ward's game and Richmond's is the shortest amount of time between major-league perfect games.\nWorld Series era (1903–present).\nCy Young.\nYoung's perfect game was part of a hitless streak of 24 or 25⅓ straight innings—depending on whether partial innings at either end of the streak are included. In either calculation, the streak remains a record. It was also part of a streak of 45 straight innings in which Young did not give up a run, which was then a record.\nAddie Joss.\nJoss's was the most pressure-packed of any regular-season perfect game. With just four games left on their schedule, the Cleveland Naps were involved in a three-way pennant race with the Tigers and the White Sox, that day's opponents. Joss's counterpart, Ed Walsh, struck out 15 and gave up just four scattered singles. The lone, unearned run scored as a result of a botched pickoff play and a wild pitch. The Naps ended the day tied with the Tigers for first, with the White Sox two games back; the Tigers won the league by a half game over the Naps. Joss threw a second no-hitter against the White Sox in 1910, making him, Tim Lincecum and Justin Verlander the only major league pitchers to throw two no-hitters against the same team.\nCharlie Robertson.\nRobertson's perfect game was only his fifth appearance, and fourth start, in the big leagues. He finished his career with a 49–80 record, the fewest wins of any perfect-game pitcher until Dallas Braden; Robertson's winning percentage of .380 remains the lowest of anyone who threw a perfect game. The Tigers, led by player-manager Ty Cobb, accused Robertson of illegally doctoring the ball with oil or grease. In terms of the opposing team's ability to get on base, this is statistically the most unlikely: the 1922 Tigers had a stellar on-base percentage (OBP) of .373.\nDon Larsen.\nLarsen did not know he would pitch in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series until a few hours before game time. This was his second start of the Series; he had lasted less than two innings in Game 2. In his perfect game, Larsen employed the style he had adopted in mid-season, working without a windup. Just one Dodgers batter—Pee Wee Reese, in the first inning—worked a three-ball count. The Dodgers had the highest season winning percentage of any team to lose a perfect game: .604. The image of catcher Yogi Berra leaping into Larsen's arms after the final strike is one of the most famous in baseball history. The 34 years between Robertson's feat and Larsen's is the longest gap between perfect games.\nJim Bunning.\nBunning's perfect game, pitched on Father's Day, was the first in the National League since Ward's 84 years before. Defying the baseball superstition that holds one should not talk about a no-hitter in progress, Bunning spoke to his teammates about the perfect game as it developed to loosen them up and relieve the pressure.\nSandy Koufax.\nKoufax's perfect game was the first one pitched at night. It was nearly a double no-hitter, as Cubs pitcher Bob Hendley gave up only one hit, a bloop double to left fielder Lou Johnson in the seventh inning that did not figure in the scoring. The Dodgers scored their only run in the fifth inning: Lou Johnson reached first on a walk, advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt, stole third, and scored when Cubs catcher Chris Krug overthrew third base on the play. The game also set records for the fewest hits by both teams, one, and the fewest base runners by both teams, two (both Johnson). Koufax's 14 strikeouts are tied with Matt Cain for the most thrown by a perfect game pitcher.\nCatfish Hunter.\nHunter, a talented batter, was also the hitting star of his perfect game. He went 3 for 4 with a double and 3 RBIs, including a bunt single that drove home the first and thus winning run in the seventh inning—easily the best offensive performance by a perfect game pitcher. At 22 years and 30 days old, Hunter was the youngest pitcher to throw a perfect game in the modern era. This was the first no-hitter of the Athletics' Oakland tenure, which was only 25 games old.\nLen Barker.\nBarker's perfect game was the first one in which designated hitters were used. He did not reach a three-ball count in the entire game. Toronto shortstop Alfredo Griffin, who played for the losing team in this game, went on to play for the losers in the perfect games of Browning and Martínez. Also on the losing end of this game was Danny Ainge, who played 14 seasons in the National Basketball Association. All 11 of Barker's strikeouts were swinging.\nMike Witt.\nWitt's perfect game came on the last day of the 1984 season. Reggie Jackson, who drove in the only run of the game on a seventh-inning fielder's choice ground ball, was also on the winning team in Catfish Hunter's perfect game. On April 11, 1990, Witt, pitching out of the bullpen, combined with starting pitcher Mark Langston to throw a no-hitter for the California Angels.\nTom Browning.\nBrowning's perfect game, for the Cincinnati Reds against the Los Angeles Dodgers in September 1988, came against the team that eventually won that year's World Series, one of only four times that has happened. A two-hour, twenty-seven-minute rain delay caused the game to start at approximately 10 p.m. Right fielder Paul O'Neill, who played for the winning side in this game, also played for the winning side in the perfect games of Wells and Cone. The following July 4, Browning came within an inning of becoming the first pitcher to throw two perfect games, retiring the first 24 batters in a game against the Phillies before surrendering a leadoff double in the ninth.\nDennis Martínez.\nMartínez, born in Granada, Nicaragua, was the first major league pitcher born outside of the United States to throw a perfect game. He achieved the feat for the Montreal Expos against the Los Angeles Dodgers in July 1991. Opposing pitcher Mike Morgan was perfect through five full innings, the latest the opposing starter in a perfect game has remained perfect. Two days earlier, Expos pitcher Mark Gardner no-hit the Dodgers through nine innings but lost the no-hitter in the tenth, meaning the Expos narrowly missed throwing a no-hitter and a perfect game in the same series. Martínez's catcher, Ron Hassey, had also caught Len Barker's perfect game. This was the third perfect game pitched against the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers, joining those of Larsen and Browning; the only other teams to lose more than one perfect game are the Twins (Hunter and Wells), the Rays (Buehrle, Hernandez, and Braden) and the Athletics (Young and German).\nKenny Rogers.\nRogers benefited from center fielder Rusty Greer's diving catch of a line drive by Rex Hudler, who led off the ninth inning. Rogers' performance against the Angels came 10 seasons after Witt's perfect game against the Rangers. The Angels and Rangers are the only major league teams to record perfect games against each other. The home plate umpire was a minor league fill-in, Ed Bean, who was working his 29th Major League game and seventh behind the plate. At the time, Bean was substituting for 17-year veteran Ken Kaiser and worked only seven more MLB games following Rogers' performance.\nDavid Wells.\nWells attended the same high school as Don Larsen: Point Loma High School, San Diego, California. They also both enjoyed the night life. Casey Stengel once said of Larsen, \"The only thing he fears is sleep.\" Wells has claimed to have been \"half-drunk\" and suffering from a \"raging, skull-rattling hangover\" during his perfect game. Wells' perfect game comprised the core of a streak of 38 consecutive retired batters (May 12–23, 1998), an American League record he held until 2007.\nDavid Cone.\nCone's perfect game occurred on Yogi Berra Day. Don Larsen threw out the ceremonial first pitch to Berra, who had been his catcher during the 1956 World Series perfect game. Larsen was the only perfect game pitcher to attend another perfect game, until Cone himself was in Oakland for Domingo German’s perfect game in 2023 as a TV analyst for the New York Yankees. No Expo worked even a three-ball count. Cone's perfect game, which took only 88 pitches, was interrupted by a 33-minute rain delay and is the only one to date in regular-season interleague play. Following teammate Wells's perfect game the previous season, this also represents the only time two successive perfect games have been thrown by the same team.\nRandy Johnson.\nJohnson threw his perfect game at the age of 40 years, 256 days, becoming the oldest pitcher to do so by 3 years. The former holder of the mark, Cy Young, threw his at the age of 37 years, 37 days. Johnson is also the tallest perfect game pitcher at 6' 10\", surpassing Mike Witt by three inches. Of the teams to have a perfect game thrown against them, the 2004 Braves have the second-highest OBP (.343) and are tied for the second-highest winning percentage (.593). In contrast, the Diamondbacks had by far the worst season winning percentage (.315) of any team to benefit from a perfect game.\nMark Buehrle.\nOn Thursday, July 23, 2009, Mark Buehrle of the Chicago White Sox pitched a perfect game against the Tampa Bay Rays. Buehrle was assisted by a ninth-inning wall-climbing catch by center fielder DeWayne Wise to rob Gabe Kapler of a home run; Wise had just entered the game as a defensive replacement before Kapler's at-bat. This was the first major league perfect game in which the pitcher and catcher were battery-mates for the first time; Ramón Castro had been acquired by the White Sox less than two months before. This was also the first perfect game to feature a grand slam, by Josh Fields in the bottom of the second inning. Umpire Eric Cooper, who called the game, had been behind the plate for Buehrle's previous no-hitter. On July 28, Buehrle followed up with another 5 2/3 perfect innings to set the major league record for consecutive batters retired at 45 (this includes the final batter he faced in his appearance before the perfect game). That record was broken by Yusmeiro Petit of the San Francisco Giants in 2014.\nDallas Braden.\nBraden's perfect game, pitched on Mother's Day, was the first complete game of his career. His grandmother attended the game and celebrated on the field with him. It was the first time a perfect game had been pitched against the team with the best record in the majors at the time; coming into the contest, the Rays were 22–8. The 2010 Rays are tied for the second-highest winning percentage (.593) of any team to be on the receiving end of a perfect game. MLB's previous perfect game had also been thrown against the Rays, making them the second team to have successive perfect games against them (the first was the Dodgers in 1988 and 1991). This game came 290 days after Buehrle's, the shortest period between modern-day perfect games—a record which lasted just three weeks, until Halladay's perfect game.\nRoy Halladay.\nHalladay, of the Philadelphia Phillies, pitched a perfect game on May 29, 2010, against the Florida Marlins, the second perfect game of the 2010 season 20 days after Braden's, the shortest period between perfect games in the modern era. Mark Buehrle's perfect game had been 10 months earlier, marking the first time that three perfect games occurred within a one-year span. Seven batters reached three-ball counts against Halladay. Halladay nearly pitched a second perfect game in the 2010 NL Division Series against the Reds but gave up a walk to Jay Bruce, making it a no-hitter; he became the only perfect game pitcher to throw another no-hitter in the same season, and the fifth with two no-hitters. Halladay was the second pitcher to throw a perfect game and win the Cy Young Award in the same season; Sandy Koufax did so in 1965.\nPhilip Humber.\nOn April 21, 2012, Philip Humber of the Chicago White Sox pitched the third perfect game in White Sox history. The final out of Humber's perfect game came after a full-count check-swing third strike to Brendan Ryan on a ball that catcher A. J. Pierzynski dropped. As Ryan disputed umpire Brian Runge's decision that he had swung, Pierzynski threw the ball to first base for the final out. As with Braden, Humber's perfect game was the first complete game of his career. Unlike Braden, the perfect game was the only complete game of Humber's career. Humber's lifetime major league record of 16-23 gives him the fewest career wins of any pitcher who has thrown an MLB perfect game. The White Sox became the second franchise with three perfect games, joining the Yankees.\nMatt Cain.\nOn June 13, 2012, Matt Cain of the San Francisco Giants pitched the first perfect game in Giants franchise history, the second of three in 2012, and the 22nd in MLB history. Third baseman Joaquín Árias threw out Jason Castro for the final out on a chopped grounder he fielded deep behind the bag. Cain tallied 14 strikeouts, tying Sandy Koufax for the most strikeouts in a perfect game. Cain's 125 pitches are the most thrown in a perfect game. Cain was aided by a running catch at the wall by Melky Cabrera in the 6th and a diving catch by Gregor Blanco in the 7th. The winning Giants scored 10 runs, making this the highest-scoring perfect game until the record was broken in 2023. Home plate umpire Ted Barrett had also called Cone's perfect game, making him the only person to call two; having umpired at third base for Humber's game, Barrett also became just the second man, after Alfredo Griffin, to have been on the field for three perfect games—within two months; since then, there have been four more.\nFélix Hernández.\nOn August 15, 2012, Félix Hernández of the Seattle Mariners threw the 23rd perfect game in MLB history (and the first in August) against the Tampa Bay Rays. This was the first perfect game in Mariners history, and the franchise's fourth no-hitter; it also made 2012 the first and to date only MLB season in which three perfect games were recorded. Hernandez's performance was highlighted by 12 strikeouts and a career-high 26 swinging-strikes. In an on-field interview immediately following the last out, Hernandez said he had started thinking about the possibility of a perfect game in the second inning. It was the third time in the past four seasons that Tampa Bay was on the losing side of a perfect game. Four Rays—Evan Longoria, Carlos Peña, B.J. Upton, and Ben Zobrist—joined Alfredo Griffin in having played in three perfect games for the losing team; all four also participated in Buehrle's and Braden's.\nDomingo Germán.\nOn June 28, 2023, Domingo Germán of the New York Yankees pitched the 24th perfect game in MLB history against the Oakland Athletics. It was the fourth perfect game by a Yankee and the 13th no-hitter in franchise history. As the Yankees scored 11 runs, this set a new record for the highest scoring perfect game. Germán became the first Dominican-born player to throw a perfect game.\nPerfect games by team.\nOf the thirty franchises that currently make up Major League Baseball, seven have never as of the end of the 2023 season been involved in a perfect game, win or loss, including three of the \"Original 16\" franchises (the Cardinals, Pirates, and Orioles) and four of the fourteen teams that joined MLB in the expansion era (the Royals, Brewers, Padres, and Rockies).\nUnofficial perfect games.\nThere have been three instances in which a major league pitcher retired every player he faced over nine innings without allowing a baserunner, but, by the current definition, is not credited with a perfect game, either because there was already a baserunner when he took the mound, or because the game went into extra innings and an opposing player eventually reached base:\nFour other games in which one team failed to reach base are not official perfect games because they were called off before nine innings were played:\nPerfect games spoiled by the 27th batter.\nOn thirteen occasions in Major League Baseball history, a perfect game has been spoiled when a batter reached base with two outs in the ninth inning. Unless otherwise noted, the pitcher in question finished and won the game without allowing any more baserunners. Note that before the American League and National League implemented the designated hitter rule in 1973 and 2022 respectively, the pitcher was usually scheduled to bat in the spot and the 27th batter was usually a pinch-hitter as a result, which was the case in six of the seven perfect games spoiled on the 27th batter without the rule in play.\nOther notable near-perfect games.\nNine or more consecutive innings of perfection.\nThere have been fifteen occasions in Major League Baseball history when a pitcher—or, in one case, multiple pitchers—recorded at least 27 consecutive outs after one or more runners reached base. In four instances, the game went into extra innings and the pitcher(s) recorded \"more\" than 27 consecutive outs:\nIn the eleven other instances, the leadoff batter (or batters) reached base in the first inning, followed by 27 consecutive batters (or batters and baserunners) being retired through the end of a nine-inning game. In two cases, the leadoff baserunner was retired, meaning the pitcher faced the minimum:\nThe remaining instances in which a pitcher recorded 27 consecutive outs in a game, noting how the opponent's leadoff batter (or batters) reached base:\nNo-hit, no-walk, no-hit batsman games.\nIn Major League Baseball play since 1893, with the essential modern rules in place, there have been twelve instances when a pitcher allowed not a single baserunner through his pitching efforts over a complete game of at least nine innings, but was not awarded a perfect game because of one or more fielding errors, or a dropped third strike:\nNo otherwise perfect game in major league history has been spoiled solely by interference or an outfield error.\nMinimum batters faced.\nThere also have been games in which one or more batters reached base, but the pitcher nonetheless faced the minimum 27 for a complete game. On July 7, 2007, Érik Bédard of the Baltimore Orioles gave up two singles to the Texas Rangers, but both base-runners were putout by double plays. On April 18, 2007 Mark Buehrle of the Chicago White Sox threw a no-hitter against the Texas Rangers. The lone base runner was Sammy Sosa who reached on a walk in the 5th inning. He was subsequently thrown out on a pickoff. On May 29, 2014 Josh Collmenter of the Arizona Diamondbacks gave up three hits in a game against the Cincinnati Reds, all three baserunners were involved in double plays. On August 1, 2023, Framber Valdez of the Houston Astros threw a no-hitter against the Cleveland Guardians. He gave up only one baserunner, a walk to Oscar González, who was erased after Will Brennan hit into a double play.\nNo-hitters with a single baserunner.\nThere have been a handful of no hitters where only a single walk, error, or other method of reaching base without a hit has been the sole spoiler of a perfect game. Below is a list of each time this has happened since 1901.\nCombined near-perfect games.\nThere has never been a combined perfect game in Major League history. However, there have been three times where pitchers combined to throw at least seven perfect innings:"

        "title": "Archie Goodwin (basketball)",
        "text": "Archie Lee Goodwin III (born August 17, 1994) is an American professional basketball player for the Ningbo Rockets of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). He played college basketball for Kentucky.\nHigh school career.\nGoodwin attended Sylvan Hills High School in Sherwood, Arkansas where he played for coach Kevin Davis and led his team to back-to-back state finals. As a junior in 2010–2011, his bid for a championship came up short when his team fell to Alma High School from Alma, Arkansas. As a senior in 2011–12, Goodwin led the Bears to the Arkansas Class 5A state championship, scoring 27 points and seven rebounds in the title game; winning championship and tournament MVP honors along the way. Goodwin was twice named the Gatorade Player of the Year for Arkansas and named to the McDonald's and \"Parade\" All-American teams.\nGoodwin was rated as the number 15 player in the class of 2012 in the ESPNU 100, the number 9 player by Scout.com, and the number 12 player by Rivals.com.\nGoodwin chose Kentucky over offers from Arkansas, Memphis, Connecticut, and Kansas, among many others.\nCollege career.\nGoodwin was the leading scorer for the 2012–13 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team. He was named Freshman All-SEC after leading Kentucky with 14.1 points per game in 33 appearances (33 starts). He also averaged 4.6 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.1 steals to help the Wildcats to a 21–12 record. He tallied a career-high 28 points on 8-of-13 shooting and 12-of-17 free throws against Morehead State on November 21. Two days later, he narrowly missed the second triple-double in UK history against LIU-Brooklyn with 22 points and career highs of nine rebounds and nine assists.\nIn his only game versus his home-state Arkansas Razorbacks, Goodwin and Kentucky lost, 73–60.\nOn April 1, 2013, Goodwin declared for the 2013 NBA draft. He was the second-youngest player to declare for the 2013 draft behind Greece's Giannis Antetokounmpo and the youngest-overall American college player.\nProfessional career.\nPhoenix Suns (2013–2016).\n2013–14 season.\nOn June 27, 2013, Goodwin was chosen by the Oklahoma City Thunder with the 29th overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft. His rights were then traded to the Golden State Warriors, before finally to the Phoenix Suns, all on draft night. On July 12, 2013, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Suns and joined them for the 2013 NBA Summer League. In his first Summer League game, Goodwin recorded 13 points and 3 rebounds against the Portland Trail Blazers.\nOn October 30, 2013, Goodwin made his NBA debut against the Portland Trail Blazers. In 8 minutes of action, Goodwin attempted three shots and grabbed one offensive rebound. Goodwin, known as an aggressive scorer in college, went scoreless in his NBA debut. However, in Goodwin's second game against the Utah Jazz on November 1, he scored his first NBA field goal. In 11 minutes of action, Goodwin shot 2-of-5 from the field and ended with 4 points; he also recorded 2 blocks. On November 19, 2013, he recorded his first double-digit-scoring game with 16 points in a loss to the Sacramento Kings.\nOn January 23, 2014, Goodwin was assigned to the Bakersfield Jam of the NBA Development League. He was recalled on January 26, reassigned on February 5, and recalled again on February 10. In the Suns' final game of the season, Goodwin scored a career-high 29 points in a 104–99 win over the Sacramento Kings.\n2014–15 season.\nAfter managing just 10 games for the Suns to start the season, Goodwin was reassigned to the Bakersfield Jam on December 25, 2014. He was recalled six days later. He was later reassigned to the Jam several more times during the season, as he helped the Jam win the inaugural D-League Showcase championship and won the Showcase Tournament's MVP award on January 19. He once again had an impressive regular season finale for the Suns, scoring a season-high 18 points in a loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.\n2015–16 season.\nTo begin the 2015–16 season, Goodwin saw limited court time aside from a 12-point, 17-minute outing in the team's season opener, which saw the Suns routed by the Dallas Mavericks at home. Over the next seven games, Goodwin averaged 6.9 minutes per game, competing for court time with new additions to the team in Devin Booker and Sonny Weems. He later had two 12-point games in mid-November, both of which he played over 24 minutes in. He did not see regular court time for the Suns until early January following the injury to Eric Bledsoe. On January 21, 2016, he scored a season-high 20 points as a starter in a loss to the San Antonio Spurs. Two days later, he topped that mark with 24 points against the Atlanta Hawks. In that game, Goodwin hit a three-pointer from atop the arc with 0.1 seconds left to lift the Suns over the Hawks with a 98–95 win, ending a six-game losing streak. He topped his season-high mark for a third game in a row on January 26, scoring 26 points in a loss to the Philadelphia 76ers. On February 2, he recorded 18 points and had a career-high 12 assists in a 104–97 loss to the Toronto Raptors. On February 10, in a game against the Golden State Warriors, Goodwin and teammate Markieff Morris got into a physical altercation on the bench and were seen arguing during a timeout. The argument escalated into a shoving match between the pair, as teammates quickly stepped in and separated the two.\nGoodwin was released by the Suns on October 24, 2016, prior to the start of the 2016–17 regular season, in a move that was considered unexpected by many in the NBA. It was suggested that the Suns already had plenty of guards that needed some playing time as it was, and that there wasn't enough time for Goodwin to be fully satisfied in the process. However, it was later confirmed by general manager Ryan McDonough that Goodwin had originally asked the team to try to trade him if it were possible, but the Suns couldn't find a team to help him out before the start of the regular season.\nNew Orleans Pelicans (2016).\nOn November 7, 2016, Goodwin signed with the New Orleans Pelicans. He made his debut for the Pelicans five days later, scoring seven points off the bench in a 126–99 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. On November 20, he was waived by the Pelicans after appearing in three games.\nGreensboro Swarm (2016–2017).\nOn November 30, 2016, Goodwin was acquired by the Greensboro Swarm of the NBA Development League. The next day, he made his debut for the Swarm in a 121–106 loss to the Texas Legends, recording 18 points, six rebounds and one assist in 29 minutes.\nBrooklyn Nets (2017).\nOn March 15, 2017, Goodwin signed a 10-day contract with the Brooklyn Nets. He went on to sign a second 10-day contract on March 25, and a multi-year contract on April 4. In the Nets' season finale on April 12, 2017, Goodwin scored a season-high 20 points in a 112–73 loss to the Chicago Bulls. On July 28, 2017, he was waived by the Nets.\nGreensboro Swarm and Northern Arizona Suns (2017–2018).\nOn September 11, 2017, Goodwin signed a training camp contract with the Portland Trail Blazers. He was waived by the Trail Blazers on October 13, 2017, after appearing in five preseason games.\nIn the 2017–18 season, Goodwin split time between the Greensboro Swarm and the Northern Arizona Suns.\nMaine Red Claws (2019).\nOn October 19, 2018, he was traded to the Maine Red Claws in exchange for the rights to Daniel Dixon, but did not make the team's final roster. On January 3, 2019, Goodwin re-signed with the Red Claws.\nSigortam.net İTÜ BB (2019–2020).\nOn September 30, 2019, Goodwin signed with Sigortam.net İTÜ BB of the Turkish Basketball Super League.\nRatiopharm Ulm (2020).\nOn February 6, 2020, Goodwin signed with Ratiopharm Ulm of the German Basketball Bundesliga. He averaged 7.0 points and 5.0 rebounds per game before the season was suspended.\nMetropolitans 92 (2020–2021).\nOn November 25, 2020, Goodwin signed with Metropolitans 92 of the LNB Pro A. He averaged 8.7 points and 2.0 rebounds per game.\nBudivelnyk (2022).\nOn January 8, 2022, Goodwin signed with Budivelnyk of the Ukrainian Basketball Super League. He left the team in February 2022 due to the Russo-Ukrainian crisis.\nMaccabi Rishon LeZion (2022–present).\nOn February 23, 2022, Goodwin signed with Maccabi Rishon LeZion of the Israeli Premier League.\nReturn to Budivelnyk (2022–present).\nOn July 31, 2022, he has signed with BC Budivelnyk of the European North Basketball League.\nPersonal life.\nGoodwin's stepfather, Datron Humphrey, introduced him to basketball as a youth. In addition, his father, Archie Goodwin II, played college basketball for Arkansas State University."

        "title": "Anthony Bennett (basketball)",
        "text": "Anthony Harris Bennett (born March 14, 1993) is a Canadian professional basketball player who is currently a free agent. He played college basketball for the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). He was the first overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers, becoming the first Canadian to be drafted number one overall. He played only four seasons in the NBA, averaging 4.4 points, and is often considered the worst number-one pick in league history.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Toronto, Ontario, Bennett was raised in the city's Jane and Finch neighbourhood, and in nearby Brampton, to where he moved at age ten. He is the son of Edith Bennett, a nurse who is originally from Jamaica, and Delroy Harris. He also has an older sister, Danielle, and an older brother, Sheldon. Edith raised her family as a single mother, working two jobs, at a hospital and a mental health facility. As a teenager in Jamaica, his mother ran track and field and played netball.\nHigh school career.\nBennett attended Harold M. Brathwaite Secondary School in Brampton. At age 16, he relocated to Beckley, West Virginia to play basketball for Mountain State Academy, and after the school closed a year later, he moved to Henderson, Nevada to play for the basketball preparatory academy Findlay Prep. He was the #1 forward and the #7 player overall in the high school class of 2012 according to ESPNU 100, the #7 player by Scout.com, and the #7 player by Rivals.com.\nWhile initially receiving interest from many teams, Bennett narrowed down his college choices to Oregon and UNLV. He committed to UNLV under head coach Dave Rice on May 12, 2012.\nCollege career.\nDuring the 2012–13 UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball season, Bennett played 35 games. While mostly starting at power forward, he would occasionally play small forward. He averaged 16.1 points and 8.1 rebounds a game despite only averaging 27.1 minutes a game due to injury. He shot 53.3% from the field overall and 37.5% from three-point range. He was extremely efficient in college, averaging a PER of 28.3. Halfway through the season, Bennett was plagued with a shoulder injury. His minutes were cut to allow him to rest and he even came off the bench in a few games. After making it to the NCAA tournament, UNLV lost in the second round to California.\nIn April 2013, Bennett declared for the NBA draft, foregoing his final three years of college eligibility. In May 2013, he underwent elective surgery for sleep apnea and asthma.\nProfessional career.\nCleveland Cavaliers (2013–2014).\nBennett was one of thirteen players invited to the green room for the 2013 NBA draft, meaning he was expected to be chosen as a top lottery pick. He was selected first overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers, making him the first Canadian ever to be selected first overall in an NBA draft.\nOn August 20, 2013, Bennett signed a 2-year, $10.9 million rookie scale contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers. After producing multiple mediocre performances to begin his rookie season, he was ranked by some as one of the worst first overall picks in recent memory. He did not score a field goal until his fifth NBA game, and missed his first 16 shot attempts in 43 minutes of playing time.\nOn January 28, 2014, Bennett recorded 15 points and 8 rebounds in a 100–89 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans. It was the first double-figure scoring game in his NBA career, coming after 33 games—three times as long as any previous No. 1 overall pick. Almost two-thirds of all previous top picks scored in double digits in their first game. On February 11, 2014, Bennett recorded his first career double-double with 19 points and 10 rebounds in a 109–99 win over the Sacramento Kings. For the 2013–2014 season, he played 52 games while averaging 4.2 points and 3.0 rebounds in 12.8 minutes per game.\nIn July 2014, Bennett joined the Cavaliers for the 2014 NBA Summer League where he averaged 13.3 points in four games.\nMinnesota Timberwolves (2014–2015).\nOn August 23, 2014, Bennett was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in a three-team trade involving the Cavaliers and the Philadelphia 76ers.\nOn October 19, 2014, the Timberwolves exercised their third-year team option on Bennett's rookie scale contract, extending the contract through the 2015–16 season. On November 21, 2014, he scored a career-high 20 points in a 121–92 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. On February 21, 2015, he was ruled out for two weeks due to an injured right ankle he sustained the day before playing against the Phoenix Suns. After recovering from the injury, Bennett appeared in just four more games to finish the 2014–2015 season. In 57 games (three starts) for the Timberwolves, he averaged career highs of 5.2 points, 3.8 rebounds and 15.7 minutes per game.\nOn September 23, 2015, Bennett was waived by the Timberwolves via a contract buyout.\nToronto Raptors (2015–2016).\nOn September 28, 2015, Bennett signed a one-year, veteran's minimum deal with his hometown Toronto Raptors. He made his debut with them on October 30, recording three rebounds and one steal in a 113–103 win over the Boston Celtics. On December 20, Bennett requested that the team send him to Raptors 905 of the NBA Development League. He played for Raptors 905 in their game against the Delaware 87ers, recording 13 points and 4 rebounds in a 105–94 win, becoming the NBA's first No. 1 overall pick to play in the D-League. He returned to Toronto later that night for their game against the Sacramento Kings. He later received three more assignments to Raptors 905. On March 1, 2016, he was waived by the Raptors. Bennett's love for the game was questioned during his tenure in Toronto, and the organization grew increasingly frustrated with his inability to grasp the cut-throat world of the NBA despite their attempts to work with him.\nBrooklyn Nets (2016–2017).\nOn July 14, 2016, Bennett signed a 2-year, $2.1 million contract with the Brooklyn Nets. He made his debut for the Nets in their third game of the season on October 29, scoring nine points in 18 minutes off the bench in a 110–108 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. On November 18, he scored a season-high 12 points in a 124–105 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. On November 27, he was assigned to Brooklyn's D-League affiliate, the Long Island Nets. He was recalled by Brooklyn prior to their game later that night. He was reassigned to Long Island on November 28, and was recalled the next day. On December 3, he made his first start of the season and had 7 points and a career-high 14 rebounds in a 112–103 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. On January 9, 2017, he was waived by the Nets.\nFenerbahçe (2017).\nOn January 13, 2017, Bennett signed with Fenerbahçe of the Turkish Basketball Super League on a 1+1 contract. In 10 EuroLeague games he averaged 1.2 points per game. Fenerbahçe went on to win their first ever EuroLeague title in 2017, beating out Olympiakos 80–64 in the championship game. On May 25, 2017, he was released by Fenerbahçe.\nNorthern Arizona Suns (2017).\nOn September 22, 2017, Bennett signed with the Phoenix Suns. On October 11, 2017, he was waived by the Suns.

It was awarded for proficiency in riding horses. Equestrian badges () remain a part of German rider training today, although their appearance is completely different.\nHistory.\nIt was instituted by the National Agriculture Association, affiliated with the National Association for Breeding and Animal Inspection and Control, authorized on 9 April 1930 as the German Horseman's Badge. The badge was awarded in three classes of Bronze, Silver, and Gold. The badge had an oval oakleaf wreath, and within the wreath was a mounted horseman astride a prancing horse with a Roman \"R\" letter in a circle at the base of the wreath.\nEach of the classes may have been awarded:\nMore difficult criteria had to be met to obtain the higher class. The badge was to be worn on the left breast. Notable recipients of the German Equestrian Badge include Reinhard Heydrich and Hermann Fegelein.\nAlso from the National Association for Breeding and Animal Inspection and Control was the German Horse Driver's Badge (), which was presented for professional horse race competitions and authorized in May 1930. The badge was of the same design as the German Horseman's Badge, with the exception of the mounted horseman being replaced by a chariot driver being pulled by two horses. The badge was issued in three classes of Bronze, Silver, and Gold. The requirements were the same as for the Horseman's Badge, except for the \"trotting race\", replacing the racing event. This award was also worn on the left breast. In addition, the German Care of Horses Badge (), which showed a man next to a horse, were issued to qualified persons in bronze, silver, and gold."

        "title": "Harry James (American football)",
        "text": "John Henry James (June 20, 1881 - October 16, 1947) was an American football quarterback and manufacturer. He was the starting quarterback for Michigan's undefeated, national championship 1903 \"Point-a-Minute\" football team that outscored opponents 565 to 6. James later went into the manufacturing business. He was the founder of The Motor Foundry Co., a manufacturer of automobile parts in Detroit, and the James Motor Valve Company, which developed the innovative \"James Valve\" in the mid-1920s. He also served as the general manager of the Monarch Steel Castings Co., an innovator in the Solvay process.\nEarly years.\nJames was born in Ohio in 1881. He was raised in Detroit and attended the Detroit University School. He was the captain of the school's football team during the 1900–1901 academic year. He was also captain of the track team during the 1899-1900 and 1900–1901 academic years.\nUniversity of Michigan.\nHe enrolled at the University of Michigan in the fall of 1901. He was captain of the All-Freshman football team in 1901 and of the reserve football team in 1902.\nIn 1903, and despite weighing only 142 pounds, James took over as the Wolverines' starting quarterback. At the start of the 1903 season, expectations were low, as the team had lost most of its starters, including the two leading scorers and starting quarterback Boss Weeks. With only eight veterans returning, team captain Curtis Redden wrote that \"[n]o season in the history of Michigan football has opened with a gloomier outlook\" than that of 1903.\nDespite the low expectations, James led the 1903 team to an 11-0-1 record while outscoring opponents 565 to 6. The 1903 team was the third of Fielding H. Yost's legendary \"Point-a-Minute\" teams and has been recognized retrospectively as a national championship team for 1903 by the National Championship Foundation.\nThe season was not without its challenges for James. Before a key game against Wisconsin, rumors spread that Yost was considering replacing James with Fred Norcross. At a rally the night before the Wisconsin game, Yost was asked directly whether he would keep James, whose wrist was bound in a splint, at quarterback. Yost replied succinctly, \"Yes. He is the better player.\" Michigan defeated Wisconsin 16–0, but the team had difficulty reaching Wisconsin's goal and relied on Tom Hammond to kick two field goals. On Hammond's first kick, the snap to James was high, but he was credited with pulling it in and placing it accurately to allow Hammond to convert the kick for a 5–0 lead.\nBefore the final game of the season, the Thanksgiving Day rivalry game with Amos Alonzo Stagg's Chicago Maroons, rumors returned that Yost might replace James with Norcross. The night before the game, Yost revealed that James had won the quarterback job over Norcross. James started and played the entire Chicago game, leading the team to a 28–0 victory. After the game, Yost said the team's play against Chicago was \"the best he had ever seen by a Michigan team during his three years here.\" The \"Detroit Free Press\" called it \"the most severe drubbing ever administered to the Maroons in the history of football of that institution.\"\nThe Wolverines compiled a perfect record with James at quarterback. The team's sole setback during the 1903 season was a 6–6 tie on the road against Minnesota. James did not appear in the Minnesota game, as Yost played Norcross at quarterback for the entire game. In its overview of the 1903 season, \"The Michigan Alumnus\" praised James:\nJames's work at quarter merits praise. It was a difficult task to set any man -- that of filling the key position in the team acceptable to those who were demanding another Weeks. James kept pluckily at his work, unmindful of adverse criticism, and in the culmination of the season, his generalship and backfield tackling were first-rate.\nJames graduated from Michigan in 1905 with an engineering degree. While attending the university, he was a member of the Vulcans, the Friars, Zeta Psi fraternity, and the Wrinkle Board and a member of the Executive Committee of the Michigan Union.\nFamily and later years.\nJames married Mary Jane Brown on November 20, 1907, in Detroit. His father-in-law, Robert H. Brown, was one of the principals of Brown Brothers Tobacco Company. In 1910, James and his wife had a daughter, Jane Elizabeth. At time of the 1910 Census, he was living with his wife Mary, his mother-in-law, infant daughter Jane E. (5 months), and a servant at the Brown house at 709 Cass Avenue in Detroit. James was employed in 1910 as the manager at a foundry.\nIn 1911, James founded The Motor Foundry Co. in Detroit to manufacture iron and steel castings. He incorporated with two partners and capital of $35,000. The company built a large foundry in Detroit at a cost of $18,000. The company specialized in manufacturing gray iron automobile parts. By April 1913, the company increased its capital to $100,000 and announced plans to expand its plant and erect additional buildings. The company employed 265 men and did casting business of 40-50 tons a day. With the expansion, capacity was to be raised to 80 tons a day.\nIn a draft registration card completed in September 1918, James indicated that he was living with his wife, Mary Brown James, at 69 Taylor Street in Detroit. He was employed at the time as the general manager of the Monarch Steel Castings Co. at 316 Solvay in Detroit. At the time of the 1920 Census was still living at 69 Taylor Street in Detroit with his wife, Mary, daughter Betty (age 9), son Dick (age 5), his mother-in-law and a servant. He was then employed as a foundry manager.\nIn the early 1920s, James founded the James Motor Valve Company in Detroit. In 1926, his company gained notoriety for its development of an innovative valve, known as the James Valve, that was immune to heat, warping, burning or pitting as a result of its hollow-head construction. The valve was first tested in 1923. James later moved his company to Marine City, Michigan, and established his residence at St. Clair, Michigan. He remained the president of the James Motor Valve Company until his death. In October 1947, James died at his home in St. Clair at age 66. He was survived by his wife, a son, and a daughter."

The Game Boy version was released as Jack Nicklaus Golf in 1992.\nIt was the first in a series of golf games named after golfer Jack Nicklaus, and was followed by \"Jack Nicklaus' Unlimited Golf &amp; Course Design\" (1990).\nGameplay.\nThe game features Jack Nicklaus' favorite 18 golf holes, all put together in a single course, which includes holes from Augusta National Golf Club, Muirfield, Pebble Beach Golf Links, Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes Golf Club, and Old Course at St Andrews. Two courses designed by Nicklaus are also featured in the game: Castle Pines (Colorado) and Desert Mountain (Arizona). Additionally, the Game Boy version includes Muirfield Village as a course. Several add-on disks were released for the computer versions to add additional courses.\nThe game features two game modes: Stroke Play and Skins. A multiplayer option allows for a maximum total of four players being able to play. The player can also compete against a selection of eight different CPU players that includes Jack Nicklaus. An image of Nicklaus also appears in between holes as he gives tips to the player.\n\"Jack Nicklaus' Turbo Golf\", for the TurboGrafx-16, differs from the other versions. In CD-ROM format, the game has five courses, including Castle Pines. The other courses were previously featured in the game's early add-on disks: The Australian Golf Club, Royal Troon Golf Club, Kemper Lakes Golf Club, and St. Creek Golf Club. The CD-ROM version allows the player to take a 360-degree look around any of the courses, and Nicklaus appears in between courses to give advice about each hole. The HuCard cartridge version of \"Jack Nicklaus' Turbo Golf\" includes only one course, The Australian Golf Club, and includes eight golfer rivals, as well as Jack Nicklaus.\nRelease.\nAccolade began publishing \"Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf\" in 1988. It had the longest title of any software product at the time of its release. By August 1989, versions had been released in the United Kingdom for the Commodore 64 and PC, while other versions for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC and Atari ST were scheduled for release that autumn. An Apple II version had been released by late 1989. As of 1990, a Macintosh version had been published by Accolade. The NES version, published by Konami, was released in the United States in March 1990, while a United Kingdom release came in August 1991. Versions were also released for the MSX, PC-88, and Sharp X68000.\nFor the U.S. TurboGrafx-16, the game was released as \"Jack Nicklaus' Turbo Golf\", in HuCard and CD-ROM formats. The game was also released for the TurboGrafx-16's foreign counterpart, the PC Engine. In the CD-ROM format, the PC Engine version was published under the title \"Jack Nicklaus' World Golf Tour\", while the game in HuCard format retained the original \"Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf\" title. \"Jack Nicklaus' Turbo Golf\" and its foreign counterparts were released in 1990 and 1991.\nThe Game Boy version, \"Jack Nicklaus Golf\", was released in the United States in May 1992; it was published by Tradewest, along with an unrelated game with the same title for the Super NES.\nReception.\nComputer versions.\nThe computer versions of the game received criticism for the slow load times in generating each new screen. Some criticized the computer version for including an off-disc copy protection scheme, which was deemed as difficult to use. Some critics favorably compared the game with the \"Leader Board\" golfing game series. Some praise was given for the graphics of the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, and Commodore 64 versions.\n\"Amstrad Action\" called the CPC version, \"Beyond a shadow of a doubt the best golf sim ever on a CPC.\" However, the magazine also wrote that the game would \"only immediately appeal\" to golf fans and people who have played computer golf games, while stating, \"These limitations will unfairly cripple the game's popularity – a crime, because it's an entertaining and well-programmed sports sim.\" \"CU Amiga-64\" praised the Amiga version's gameplay but was critical of the minimal sounds, the putting, and the \"agonisingly slow\" computer golfer opponent. \"Zzap!64\" reviewed the Commodore 64 version and criticized the sound effects, as well as the blocky scenery and its unusual color schemes. \"The Games Machine\", reviewing the CPC and ST versions, criticized the blocky scenery and its murky colors, as well as simple sound effects and poorly animated golfer sprites. Reviewing the Amiga version, the magazine praised the digitized image of Jack Nicklaus that appears in between holes, but criticized the rest of the graphics.\nTom Malcom of \".info\" reviewed the Commodore 64 version; he called the graphics adequate and the sound \"abominable,\" and concluded that the game, overall, was a good choice. Malcom subsequently reviewed the Amiga version; he praised the gameplay but felt the graphics were \"not what they could, and should, be.\" He also wished there had been an option to turn off Jack Nicklaus' advice before each hole, stating that it slowed down the gameplay considerably.\nBob Wade of \"Amiga Format\" praised the sound. Tony Hetherington of \"Your Amiga\" criticized bad putting controls. He called the game \"perfectly playable and competently programmed,\" but still considered it bland. \"Amiga Action\" praised the game and recommended it, but considered \"Leader Board\" to be superior. \"Amiga User International\" recommended the game for people who had not already purchased \"Mean 18\", a similar golf game also by Accolade.\nDan Muse of \"inCider\" praised the Apple II version as \"a new standard in computer golf games\" and \"the best sports game, period.\" Regarding the image of Nicklaus that appears in between holes, Muse wrote, \"Okay, it's a little corny, but I like it.\" Michael Dashe of \"Macworld\" praised the Macintosh version for its graphics, realistic gameplay, and variety of courses.\nMike Siggins reviewed \"Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf\" for \"Games International\" magazine, and gave it 4 stars out of 5, and stated that \"In the end, this is an excellent game that is badly let down by one feature: the painfully slow screen updates.\"\nMike Siggins reviewed \"Jack Nicklaus Golf – Additional Courses Vol II\" for \"Games International\" magazine, and gave it a rating of 7 out of 10, and stated that \"It is good to see Accolade supporting the program with these high quality course disks but their assumption seems to be that there is nothing wrong with the product. This I find hard to understand and would suggest, unless you aren't bothered by round of computer golf taking a couple of hours, that you don't bother buying any more add-on disks until the problem is attended to.\"\nOther versions.\nThe NES and TurboGrafx-16 versions were also criticized for slow reanimation. \"Raze\" reviewed the NES version and stated that because of its easy gameplay, it was more fun to play it with other people rather than alone. \"Mean Machines\" criticized the NES version for its blocky scenery, stating that it hampered gameplay. The magazine also criticized the golfer sprite, the \"average\" sound effects, and the lack of music, and concluded that it was a \"very tedious golf sim, which only die-hard fans of the genre should take a chance on.\" The \"Chicago Sun-Times\", reviewing one of the game's versions, wrote, \"Great for golfing enthusiasts and good for those who are new to golf.\"\nChip and Jonathan Carter, writing for the \"Philadelphia Daily News\", reviewed the TurboGrafx-16 cartridge version and stated that additional courses would have been nice, although they praised the gameplay and graphics. \"GamePro\" reviewed the TurboGrafx-16 CD-ROM version and recommended the game for golf fans, but criticized the slow reanimation and stated that the game did not offer much to distinguish it from other golf games."

        "title": "2012 Daytona 500",
        "text": "The 2012 Daytona 500 was the first stock car race of the 2012 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season. The 54th iteration of the event, it was held between February 27 and 28, 2012 at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida, before a crowd of 140,000. Matt Kenseth driving for Roush Fenway Racing took the 202-lap race for his first win of the season and his second Daytona 500 victory. Dale Earnhardt Jr. finished second and Greg Biffle was third.\nThe race was scheduled for February 26 but heavy rain forced NASCAR officials to delay it until February 27 at 7:02 p.m. EST. Carl Edwards, who won the pole position by posting the fastest lap in qualifying, was immediately passed by Biffle before the first turn. Biffle maintained this position until he was passed by Regan Smith on lap eleven. Denny Hamlin took over the lead after a second caution period and led the race for 57 laps, during which Biffle also led. Matt Kenseth assumed the first place on lap 146 and maintained it until a seventh caution period twelve laps later. The race was stopped for two hours and five minutes after Juan Pablo Montoya hit a jet dryer on lap 160, causing fuel to seep onto the track and catch fire. Kenseth regained the first position just before the lap 166 restart, and maintained it for the last thirty-eight laps to win the race.\nThe race had ten cautions and saw twenty-five lead changes by ten different drivers. The result gave Kenseth the Drivers' Championship lead with 47 points, five ahead of Earnhardt, Biffle, and Hamlin. Jeff Burton followed in fifth on 41 points. Ford led the Manufacturers' Championship with nine points, three ahead of Chevrolet in second. Toyota was third with four, and Dodge was fourth. The race attracted on average 13.69 million television viewers, with 36.5 million watching part or all of the race, making it the second most-watched 500 in history.\nBackground.\nThe 2012 Daytona 500 was the first of 36 scheduled stock car races of the 2012 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, and the 54th edition of the event. It was scheduled to be held on February 27, 2012, in Daytona Beach, Florida, at Daytona International Speedway, a superspeedway that holds NASCAR races. The layout used for the Daytona 500 is a four-turn, superspeedway. Daytona's turns are banked at 31 degrees, and the front stretch—the location of the finish line—is banked at 18 degrees. Trevor Bayne was the race's defending winner.\nThe Daytona 500 was conceived by NASCAR founder Bill France Sr., who owned the Daytona International Speedway. The race was first held in 1959; it is the successor to shorter races held on beaches around Daytona Beach, Florida. The race has been the opening round of the NASCAR season since 1982. From 1988 it was one of four events that require cars to run restrictor plates; alongside the summer Daytona race and the two races at Talladega Superspeedway. The Daytona 500 offers the most prize money of any auto race held in the United States.\nOn February 20, 2011, NASCAR's vice president of operations Steve O'Donnell announced that the 2012 Daytona 500 would be moved from its traditional President's Day weekend slot to the final Sunday of February. The decision was based on the possibility of an extended National Football League schedule; the Daytona 500 was moved to avoid a potential clash with the Super Bowl. This shortened the NASCAR season by one week; the company planned to maintain momentum during the early part of the year.\nAfter the two-car style draft—also called tandem racing—dominated races held on restrictor plate tracks during 2011, NASCAR reduced the size of the radiators from five liters to two and the air intakes were moved towards the cars' fascia section. The size of the restrictor plate was reduced by and the cars were required to run with softer springs and a smaller rear spoiler. These changes were intended to reduce the effectiveness of two-car style drafting and to make the cars more challenging to turn. Sprint Cup Series director John Darby stated, \"We want to be able to give the teams more options when it comes to drafting and we want to be able to reduce the difference in the speeds between the tandem style of racing and more of the pack style of racing that the fans are accustomed to seeing\".\nIn preparation for the race and to test the new car package, NASCAR held several test sessions on January 12–14, 2012. Test sessions began at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) (), and were paused at midday for a lunch break. They then resumed at 1:00 pm. EST, before concluding at 5:00 pm. 31 drivers participated in the first session on the morning of January 12; Jeff Gordon was quickest with a speed of , while Kyle Busch had the highest speed of during the second session in the afternoon. At the end of the second session, NASCAR announced that the opening of the restrictor plate would be increased by to be wide and the pressure release valve settings were reduced from to .\nOn the second day, NASCAR allowed drivers to draft in packs to check the cars' responses. During the third session on the morning of January 13, in which 32 drivers took part, Martin Truex Jr. and Clint Bowyer were both quickest with a speed of , and Kurt Busch recorded the fastest speed of in the fourth session held in the afternoon. Ryan Newman and Casey Mears decided to leave after the session. During the fifth session, held on the morning on January 14, 30 drivers took part; Kasey Kahne and Gordon were both quickest with a speed of . After the session, Danica Patrick, Tony Stewart, Kurt Busch and Ricky Stenhouse Jr. left the circuit and NASCAR increased the pressure value from to . Gordon was fastest in the sixth and final session held in the afternoon, with a speed of .\nDuring the 2012 Budweiser Shootout, some of the cars' engines overheated while driving in packs; NASCAR increased the engines' pressure release values from to to help reduce overheating and alleviate the effects of driving at high temperatures.\nPractice and qualification.\nThere were seven practice sessions held before the race. The first two were held on February 18 and ran for 120 and 105 minutes each. The next two on February 22 were shortened to 90 minutes each. Two days later, two more practice sessions were scheduled, which both ran for 60 minutes. The final practice session was held on February 25 and lasted 60 minutes. Greg Biffle lapped fastest at 46.537 seconds in the first session, 0.011 seconds quicker than Marcos Ambrose. Jeff Gordon, Bayne, Paul Menard, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Stewart, Matt Kenseth, Aric Almirola and Carl Edwards rounded out the session's top ten drivers. In the second practice session, Biffle remained fastest with a time of 46.574 seconds, followed by Bayne, Truex, Stewart and Mark Martin, Menard, Edwards, Ambrose, Gordon and A. J. Allmendinger .\nThere were forty-nine cars entered in the qualifier, NASCAR's qualifying procedure permitted forty-three to race. Each driver ran two laps, and unlike most races during the season, the qualifying session determined the first two positions, while the rest of the drivers qualified by the 2012 Gatorade Duels. Edwards clinched his eleventh pole position of his career, his first in the Daytona 500, with a time of 46.216 seconds. The time was the fastest recorded average speed since Jeff Gordon's pole lap in the 1999 race. He was joined on the front row of the grid by teammate Biffle. It was the first time since the 2007 race that Ford cars had the top two starting positions. Bowyer who recorded the 22nd fastest time, had his car twice fail the post-race inspection for height sticks and was required to start at the rear of the field in the second Gatorade Duel race. After the qualifier, Edwards commented, \"It's huge to start this year for us and this company with the run today. This is the result of a lot of hard work this offseason and we are now ready to focus on how to win this Daytona 500.\"\nKenseth led the third practice session, with a time of 44.809 seconds. Bayne, Stenhouse, Ambrose, Martin, Bowyer, Michael McDowell, Kevin Harvick, Menard, and Kahne followed in the top ten. Brad Keselowski slowed to avoid Newman which caused Bowyer to turn into Keselowski, sending him spinning into the grass on the backstretch. Keselowski's car had sustained minor damage which meant he was not required to use his back-up car as mechanics were able to repair the damage. Almirola led fourth practice (where twenty-five drivers took part) with a lap of 45.065 seconds, nearly one-tenth of a second faster than David Stremme. David Ragan was third ahead of Robert Richardson Jr. and Biffle. During the session (where drivers ran in packs and drafted off each other), Juan Pablo Montoya made contact with Kahne, who was sent spinning into the grass on the frontstretch which caused parts of his car's nose to be torn off. Kahne was required to use his back-up car for the rest of Speedweeks.\nStewart and Kenseth were the winners of the Gatorade Duels. The qualifying grid was finalized with Stewart in third and Kenseth in fourth. Earnhardt, Regan Smith, Ambrose, Jimmie Johnson, Jeff Burton and Elliott Sadler completed the top ten. The six drivers that failed to qualify were Michael Waltrip, Richardson, Bill Elliott, Mike Wallace, Kenny Wallace and J. J. Yeley. After the duels, Patrick, David Gilliland, Montoya and Menard went to back-up cars because they were involved in wrecks during the first duel.\nEdwards was fastest in fifth practice with a 45.301 seconds lap, one-thousand of a second in front of Almirola. Ambrose was third quickest, ahead of Montoya and Biffle. Kahne and Gordon were sixth and seventh quickest, within one second of Edwards' time. Kyle Busch (with a time of 45.026) led the sixth session ahead of Joey Logano who set an identical time to Kyle Busch. Kurt Busch had the third-fastest time. Denny Hamlin was next ahead of Stewart. Truex, Stenhouse, Allmendinger, Kesleowski and Gordon followed in the top ten. Gilliland's lap of 44.969 seconds topped the final practice session (where thirty-seven drivers participated), followed by Bayne, Stenhouse, Almirola, and Jeff Gordon in the top five positions. During the final practice session, Kurt Busch hit a bird which tore a small hole in the bottom of his radiator causing water to be drained from his car. He changed his car's engine because the damage could not be repaired.\nRace.\nThe race, broadcast live on television in the United States by Fox and by TSN2 in Canada, was due to start at 1:00 pm. EST, but heavy rain prompted NASCAR officials to delay it until the afternoon of February 27, making it the first Daytona 500 to be postponed; because of this, wrestler John Cena, who was supposed to wave the green flag, was in Portland for a WWE commitment. Further rain fell during February 27, delaying the race until 7:02 pm. EST, making it the first race to start in primetime. Commentary was provided by Mike Joy, with analysis given by retired driver Darrell Waltrip and former crew chief Larry McReynolds. Pastor Sonny Gallman of Central Baptist Church, Daytona, began the pre-race ceremonies with the invocation. Daytona Beach resident Melisa TenBroeck performed the U.S. national anthem, and Wood Brothers Racing co-founder Leonard Wood gave the command for the drivers to start their engines. During the pace laps, Patrick, Menard, Montoya and Gilliland moved to the back of the grid because they had switched to their backup cars; Kurt Busch did the same because he had changed his car's engine. Kahne did not move to the rear because he changed to his backup car before the Gatorade Duels.\nWeather conditions at the start were cloudy with the air temperature at . Biffle accelerated from the start line quicker than his teammate Edwards, leading him at the first turn. At the start of lap two a five car crash was triggered by Sadler making contact with Johnson in the tri-oval; Johnson's car spun sideways and caught those of Patrick, Kurt Busch, Ragan and Bayne. The incident triggered the first caution of the race and the pace car. Johnson and Ragan were forced to retire but Patrick, Bayne and Kurt Busch drove back to their garages for repairs. None of the drivers who were involved in the accident sustained injuries. The race restarted on lap eight, with Biffle leading Kenseth and Edwards. On the eleventh lap, Smith took the lead; one lap later Biffle moved back into the lead in turn three with aid from teammate Edwards.\nOn lap 13, Newman looped his car on the backstretch at the exit of the second corner without making contact with the wall; a second caution was issued, during which the leaders, including Biffle, made pit stops. Newman's left-front tire was unsecured and he collided with Allmendinger on pit road. Menard and Hamlin—both of whom chose not to pit—led the field back to speed at the restart on lap 17; by the end of the lap Hamiln had the lead. Hamlin began to pull away from the rest of the field, with Menard in his tow as the leaders began to run in single file. After starting the race in 26th, Truex had moved up 18 positions to eighth by lap 21, and Bowyer had moved up 20 positions to be running in tenth. Biffle tried to pass Truex for seventh on the 23rd lap but Truex kept the position. Both drivers continued to battle for the next two laps. By lap 25, Hamlin was still leading with Menard, Ragan, Logano, Jeff Burton, Ambrose and Truex in the top seven positions. Bayne rejoined the race on lap 37.\nOn lap 44, Burton, with assistance from Biffle, moved into the lead on the outside of the exit of turn two. Hamlin, who had dropped to third, attempted a passing manoeuvre around the outside for the lead one lap later but dropped to sixth. Green flag pit stops began on lap 56; most of the leaders, including Burton, made pit stops on lap 59. Gordon moved into the lead on lap 61 and began to pull away from Burton. Three laps later, debris was reported in turn two, triggering the third caution. Some drivers, including Gordon, made pit stops for fuel during the caution. During Kenseth's pit stop on lap 66, his team made repairs to his car, which had a water pressure problem. His mechanics changed the car's water and Kenseth rejoined the race in 33rd.\nBurton led the field at the restart on lap 68, followed by Biffle, Ambrose, Truex and Kyle Busch. Biffle passed Burton to gain the lead in turn one, with Ambrose moving into second by turn three. Burton had dropped to sixth position by lap 76; Truex had moved ahead of Biffle around the outside for the lead on the same lap. Biffle reclaimed the lead momentarily on lap 78 but Truex overtook him. Three laps later, the fourth caution of the race was prompted when Jeff Gordon's engine failed and flames appeared from his car going into turn three. Most of the drivers, including Truex, made pit stops under caution.\nTerry Labonte chose not to stop and led the field at the lap 86 restart, followed by Biffle, who reclaimed the lead on the same lap. Ambrose made contact with Terry Labonte coming off the fourth turn on lap 88 and rested at the side of the pit road; the race's fifth caution was issued. Some drivers chose to pit under caution. The race restarted on lap 92 with Biffle leading from Ambrose on the outside lane and Truex. Eight laps later, Truex, assisted by Hamlin, passed Biffle going into the third turn to take the lead and earned $200,000 for leading at the halfway point. On the 102nd lap, Stewart took over the lead on the backstretch before Hamlin went underneath him betweens turns three and four to reclaim the first position. Two laps later, Truex had moved back into second place. By lap 110, pole position driver Edwards was running in 21st and was reporting fluctuations in his car's fuel pressure.\nBowyer started to slow on lap 127, running out of fuel. He could not go to pit road because two faster cars blocked his entry. He coasted on the side of the track before stopping at turn two, triggering the sixth caution on the 129th lap. Most of the leaders, including Hamlin, made pit stops under caution. Martin led the field up to speed at the restart on lap 133; he was followed by Smith and Biffle. On the same lap, Biffle, with aid from Hamlin, passed Martin for the lead entering the third turn. Biffle lost the lead when Hamlin passed him on lap 139; five laps later his teammate Logano took over first place. Kenseth carried extra momentum and drove to the high side of the fourth turn to take the lead from Logano on the 146th lap. Two laps later, Earnhardt moved into second after passing Logano. The top fifteen drivers were separated by less than a second by lap 154.\nJet dryer incident.\nStremme's engine failed on lap 157 and his car spun in front of a small pack of traffic after his car dropped oil on the track, causing the seventh caution. The leaders, which included Kenseth, made pit stops and some for two tires. Under caution, teams employed varying strategies as rain was approaching the circuit. Montoya reported to his team that he felt a vibration on his car after leaving pit road; he returned to his pit box on lap 159 where his pit crew checked underneath his car for the vibration which they could not find. He then drove at racing speed after rejoining the track at turn two to catch up with the pace car when a rear trailing arm on his car broke at turn three where two jet dryers were clearing debris. He lost control, skidded up the banking and collided with a trailer-mounted jet engine filled with of jet kerosene, destroying it and rupturing the fuel tank, which started leaking fuel onto the track. Montoya drifted down the track onto the infield grass. Almost a minute later, something caused the jet fuel to ignite, creating a wall of fire across the track. The conflagration caused a red flag to be shown.\nOver the course of two hours and five minutes, NASCAR officials extinguished the fire and cleaned and repatched the track. Montoya climbed out of his car on his own, but the driver of the safety truck, 52-year-old Duane Barnes, had to be assisted down the banking. Montoya and Barnes were taken to the nearby Halifax Medical Center for examination. The jet dryer and the truck it was attached to was removed from the track by two forklifts. Light rain hit at the track and later broke up. Keselowski gained a large amount of attention during the red flag when he used an iPhone to photograph the accident scene and post it to Twitter. Dave Blaney, Landon Cassill, Tony Raines and Gilliland were the leaders prior to the red flag, having not made pit stops under caution. Edwards and Kyle Busch removed tear-offs from their windshields and were required to go to the back of the field.\nFinish.\nThe race resumed under caution at 11:57 pm. EST, following the red flag period that lasted two hours, five minutes and twenty-nine seconds. Mears ran out of fuel at turn two and had to be pushed to pit road by the recovery truck. Blaney, Cassill, Raines and Gilliland made pit stops for fuel, allowing Kenseth to take the lead for the lap 166 restart, ahead of teammate Biffle and Earnhardt in third, and maintained the lead for the next ten laps. On lap 176, the eighth caution was issued after Mears made contact with Almirola, who regained control of his car, but Mears went into the side of Ambrose in the first turn. The restart was delayed for one lap because Logano was moved to the back of the field for failing to maintain car speed. Kenseth led the field at the lap 183 restart, followed by Biffle.\nFive laps later, however, a multi-car collision occurred on the frontstretch after Jamie McMurray cut a tire, veered off and collided with Kahne, triggering an eleven car chain-reaction accident involving Edwards, Stewart, Almirola, Keselowski and Smith. Earnhardt's and Stewart's cars sustained minor damage; the ninth caution of the race was issued. The race restarted on lap 194, with Kenseth again leading. As the cars were running single file, A second multi-car collision occurred on lap 197 the entry to turn one, collecting a total of 18 cars including Stewart, Blaney, Stenhouse, Cassill, Kyle Busch and Ryan Newman, triggered the final caution of the race. At the lap 201 restart, a green–white–checker finish extended the race to 202 laps, with Kenseth leading Biffle, Hamlin, Earnhardt and Burton. Kenseth withstood pressure from Biffle and Earnhardt over the final two laps and crossed the finish line on lap 202 to win his second Daytona 500. Biffle weaved on the backstretch to block Earnhardt but the Hendrick Motorsports driver passed Biffle at the finish for second. Hamlin finished fourth, and Burton was fifth. Menard, Harvick, Edwards, Logano and Martin completed the top ten finishers. The race had a total of ten cautions and twenty-five lead changes among ten different drivers.\nAfter the race.\nKenseth appeared in the victory lane to celebrate his first victory of the season; earning $1,589,390 for the victory. Kenseth's victory was the 300th for his team Roush Fenway Racing in all three major series of NASCAR.\nFollowing his win, Kenseth said, \"It feels great. I wasn't expecting to win when I woke up this morning. It feels good to be sitting here\", and, \"I think the 16 [Biffle] had one of the strongest cars all week, and ours was right there as well. It took a long time to get to the front, but like Thursday, once we were in the front it was hard for anyone to get locked on to you.\" Earnhardt, who finished in second place, said, \"We couldn't ever get to Matt. I kind of waited until the last minute. I thought it was a great race. I want to thank the fans for sticking around on a Monday night and everyone who tuned in at home. Sorry about the delay and everything.\" Biffle, who took third, said, \"We had a great speed weeks. Coming out of here with a third place finish is really exciting for us.\"\nMontoya expressed surprise over the crash where he hit a jet dryer under the race's seventh caution, \"I've hit a lot of things—but a jet dryer?\". He also said his helmet was singed in the fire and he had an aching foot. NASCAR President Mike Helton was also surprised over the incident, \"You would think after 65 years and running all the races that NASCAR has run ... that you've seen about everything. You do think about, 'Oh, my gosh, if that can happen, what else can happen?'\" Track worker Barnes thanked the fans and Montoya for their concerns. International Speedway Corporation president Joie Chitwood III said that track officials abided by standard procedures when clearing the track, \"The team was prepared. The expertise was there. The training was there. The teamwork with NASCAR was there.\" A NASCAR spokesperson said, \"Things were operating in a normal fashion ... it was an extraordinary circumstance that occurred when something went awry in the No. 42 car.\", and, \"Under caution, it is standard for a car to 'catch up' to the rest of the field, which is what the No. 42 car was doing.\" Montoya's car was examined by NASCAR officials before it returned to Earnhardt Ganassi Racing's shop in Concord, North Carolina. NASCAR did not fine Keselowski for tweeting during the red flag period and was allowed to keep his iPhone in his pocket for the rest of the season.\nLater in the week, track officials conducted a thorough analysis of the track in turn three and determined the damage was worse than originally thought. A second patch job was conducted for the track's upcoming Daytona Bike Week events in March. After the Bike Week, the affected area of track was completely removed and resurfaced by Lane Construction—the same company that resurfaced the entire track prior to the 2011 Daytona 500. Repairs were completed in time for the Coke Zero 400 in July. From the Subway Fresh Fit 500 onward, NASCAR required that an additional pace car would be behind the last jet dryer on track in all three national series and jet dryer drivers were allowed to wear helmets and fire suits for extra protection. The jet dryer incident was described as \"one of the most bizarre events\" in the history of NASCAR and the Daytona 500 by various American media organizations.\nTwo days after the race, Hendrick Motorsports was penalized for Johnson's car. The penalty, for \"actions detrimental to stock car racing\", included a $100,000 fine and a six-race suspension for crew chief Chad Knaus and car chief Ron Malec and the loss of 25 owner and driver points for Jeff Gordon and Johnson. Both Knaus and Malec were placed on probation until May 9, 2012, and were suspended from NASCAR until April 18, 2012. Speed analyst and former driver Kyle Petty thought the penalties went too far, stating that the car was never raced and questioned why NASCAR issued the penalties. Hendrick Motorsports immediately announced it would appeal the decision; Knaus and Malec were allowed to work with the team during the appeal. The team lost the initial appeal on March 13, and made a final appeal to NASCAR National Commissioner John Middlebrook. As a result of the final appeal held on March 20, Knaus and Malec's six-race suspension was lifted and the points penalties to Johnson and Jeff Gordon were rescinded; however, the $100,000 fine administered to Knaus was upheld.\nAs this was the first race of the season, Kenseth led the Drivers' Championship with 47 points, followed by Earnhardt, Biffle and Hamlin, who were all tied for second on 42 points. Burton followed in fifth on 40 points. Ford became leader in the Manufacturers' Championship with nine points. Chevrolet was in second with six points, Toyota in third place with four points, one point ahead of Dodge in fourth. The race had an average television audience of 13.69 million viewers. An estimated 36.5 million total viewers watched all or part of the race, which was a 22 percent increase from the previous year's event. It became the most viewed NASCAR race in Fox's history and was the network's highest rated Monday night since Game Five of the 2010 World Series sixteen months previously. The race garnered the highest ratings in the 18–49 demographic, and was also the second most watched Daytona 500 behind the 2006 race. The race took three hours, thirty-six minutes and two seconds to complete, and the margin of victory was 0.210 seconds."

        "title": "Jane Blalock v. Ladies Professional Golf Association",
        "text": "Jane Blalock v. Ladies Professional Golf Association was an ongoing lawsuit that took place between 1972 and 1975, following a professional golf incident in 1972. A month after winning the Dinah Shore Colgate Winner's Circle in 1972, American golfer Jane Blalock was allegedly observed replacing her marker incorrectly at the Bluegrass Invitational during the 1972 LPGA Tour. Blalock was fined and suspended by the LPGA Tour executive board. The suspension led to a fair degree of press coverage, with Blalock filing an antitrust countersuit in United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia shortly afterwards.\nIn June 1973, federal judge Charles A. Moye Jr. ruled that \"LGPA players cannot police their own members,\" and that Blalock's suspension \"was ill-founded.\" A court awarded Blalock damages the following year. The LPGA subsequently announced plans to appeal. The ongoing lawsuit led to the LPGA searching for its first commissioner, and after Ray Volpe was appointed to the role in July 1975, a month later the LPGA dropped its appeal and settled all claims on the Blalock case.\nBackground.\nJane Blalock was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire on September 19, 1945. She began golfing at age 13, and won the New Hampshire Amateur five straight times beginning in 1965, plus the New England Amateur in 1968. Blalock attended Rollins College in Florida, graduating in 1967 with a degree in history. Prior to her playing the LPGA Tour, Blalock worked as a high school history teacher.\nThe first time Blalock played on the LPGA Tour was as an amateur at the 1964 Lady Carling Eastern Open. She finished T33.\nStill an amateur, Blalock finished 5th at the 1969 Burdine's Invitational.\nBlalock turned pro later in 1969 and went on to earn LPGA Tour Rookie of the Year honors. In 1970, Blalock notched her first professional victory at the Lady Carling Open. On April 16, 1972, Blalock won the inaugural version of the Dinah Shore Colgate Winner's Circle, an event which would later be considered a women's major golf championship. One month later she won the Suzuki Golf Internationale, beating Kathy Whitworth.\nHistory of the conflict.\nDisqualification (1972).\nAfter reaching the status of \"top money winner on this year's [LPGA] tour,\" Blalock was competing in the Bluegrass Invitational in Louisville, Kentucky by mid May 1972. After the second round the LPGA executive board called Blalock in to tell her she was disqualified from the tournament, contending that she signed an incorrect scorecard and also levying a $500 fine. Although Blalock's scorecards had been signed and attested by fellow competitors, Tourney director Gene Mcauliff stated that Blalock \"did not mark her ball properly on the 17th green and then failed to take a two-stroke penalty as required for that infraction.\"\nAll five members of the executive committee, Linda Craft, Sharon Miller, Judy Rankin, Cynthia Sullivan, and Penny Zavichas, were themselves active players. After Blalock's initial interaction with the committee at the Bluegrass Invitational, 27 LPGA players signed an affidavit demanding \"that more severe action be taken against Jane Blalock,\" specifically arguing that probation, a fine, and disqualification from the Bluegrass tournament were not enough punishment.\nHearings and suspension (1972).\nOn May 20, 1972 the LPGA executive board suspended Blalock for one year \"for actions inconsistent with the code of ethics of the organization.\" The suspension came shortly after the announcement that Blalock wouldn't be allowed to compete in the Lady Carling Open. The tour also put a hold on her money earnings from the tour, at the time around $50,000.\nIn defending their reasons for the suspension, the board stated in a press release that \"the action was taken after Miss Blalock met with the executive committee on three occasions in the last 10 days. She admitted actions on the golf course which are contrary to the rules of the game.\" According to \"Sports Illustrated,\" the board also claimed that Blalock had \"been under suspicion for over a year, that there [had] been repeated violations, that witnesses in the gallery at Louisville had observed her replacing the ball to the side of her marker on the green and that Janie tearfully admitted to her guilt. Miss Blalock was denying everything.\" LPGA executive director Bud Erickson also stated that he had requested Blalock to feign a back injury in an effort to avoid bad publicity, but she refused.\nInitial antitrust lawsuit (1972).\nOn June 1, 1972, Blalock filed a $5 million antitrust lawsuit against the LPGA's suspension on advice of her attorneys, with the intent of \"[leaving] it to the court whether she had been suspended wrongly.\" Blalock's lawyers moved for her be allowed to continue playing while the suit was resolved. As part of their argument, Blalock's lawyers denied she had ever admitted guilt to the LPGA, stating that the described admissions had been a misinterpretation of her words. Furthermore, based on the sequence of events, attorney Eugene Partain \"alleged that the suspension and petitions were likely the result of other players attempting to remove a significant competitor, and that the act of suspending Blalock from playing in any significant tournaments was a violation of federal antitrust laws by the LPGA.\"\nAround June 19, Blalock met with the LGPA in U.S. District Court in Atlanta over the lawsuit. Later that month U.S. District Court Judge Charles A. Moye Jr. granted the motion for Blalock to continue competing in the LPGA Tour until the lawsuit was resolved, in effect creating a temporary restraining order against the suspension. Moye also ruled that any tour money Blalock earned during the case would be placed in a court trust. The LPGA reacted to Moye's rulings by announcing they would file an appeal suit.\nColleagues' initial reactions (1972).\nNews of the suspension and alleged rules violation drew significant press coverage, as well as mixed reactions from Blalock's colleagues. Though he said he had never seen her move a ball against the rules himself, her former instructor Bob Toski stated that \"She has a compulsion to win. I think she needs psychiatric help\" and \"the other players tell me this has been going on for a while.\" In contrast, Blalock's caddie from the Suzuki tournament contacted her with an offer to testify in her support. Men's professional golfer Dave Hill, who himself filed an antitrust suit in 1971 against the PGA Tour, sent Blalock a note of encouragement. In his golf memoir \"Teed Off\", published in 1977, Hill wrote that he didn't know how Blalock continued to play well under the pressure she was enduring. The fact that Blalock did play well made Hill think she was innocent unless she was a victim of some illness.\nGolfer Sandra Palmer had also publicly defended Blalock as of July 8, 1972, after she and Blalock tied for lead at the George Washington Golf Classic. Stated Palmer to the press, \"I've never seen her do anything [illegal], nor do I think probably that very many of the players have. I think supposedly that out of all these players who accused, only one or two have played with her.\" Palmer explained she didn't understand why bystanders hadn't reported the alleged infractions when they occurred, also pointing out that other players had always signed Blalock's scorecards without reporting any incidents. Stated Palmer, \"if you see an infraction of the rules... you don't wait until three years later to report something. Once you've signed that card, you're as guilty as the person who committed the violation.\"\nProbation of Sandra Palmer (1972).\nThe \"Sarasota Journal\" reported on June 28, 1972, that Sandra Palmer had been \"warned\" by the LPGA over her statements of support for Blalock, with the LPGA explaining to Palmer that \"you're entitled to your own opinion, but when it hurts our members, we feel you owe the organization an apology.\" Bud Erickson, executive director of the LPGA, later clarified that Palmer was also ordered \"not to make any further statements of support for Miss Blalock.\" The warning occurred as the tour arrived at the Lady Pepsi Golf Tournament, where Blalock had previously won two championships. On August 2, 1972, Palmer was put on one year's probation by the LPGA executive committee for voicing her support of Blalock. Blalock went on to win two more times in 1972, at the Dallas Civitan Open and the Lady Errol Classic.\nRulings and settlements (1973–75).\nAfter filing the original antitrust suit, Blalock amended the suit to include only damages from not being able to compete in the Lady Carling Tournament in 1972 for $4,500.\nIn June 1973, Judge Charles Moye Jr. ruled that \"LGPA players cannot police their own members.\" The ruling declared that Blalock's suspension \"was ill-founded,\" with all remaining litigation to be focused on damages. In September 1973, \"The Telegraph\" reported that as a result of the court ruling in Blalock's favor, the LPGA and their new president Carol Mann were looking to appoint a commissioner to \"[enable] the association to penalize, suspend and fine members who violate rules and regulations.\"\nIn August 1974, a court awarded Blalock the full $4,500 she had asked for in damages, with the LPGA again announcing plans to appeal. Afterwards, in March 1975, Judge Charles Moye again ruled in Blalock's favor, awarding her $13,500 in damages and ordering the LPGA to pay her legal fees of $95,303. The LPGA again announced it would appeal the ruling in its entirety. Ray Volpe was appointed the first LPGA Commissioner on July 8, 1975, and a month later the LPGA announced it had dropped its appeal and settled \"all claims and counter claims growing from a dispute between it and golfer Jane Blalock.\"\nAftermath.\nBlalock refused to condemn her critics, including her former mentor Bob Toski, after her lawsuit was settled. She said to a reporter in 1978 \"I should not judge others as they have judged me. Life is too short and there is too much sadness. So I can't clutter my mind with all that other stuff. It makes it hard to concentrate.\" Toski left the Senior PGA Tour in 1986 after he became involved in a controversy over how he was marking his ball. Toski returned in April 1986 and played several more years on the Tour.\nBlalock continued playing on the LPGA Tour through 1987. When she was through playing, Blalock had 27 Tour wins to her credit. She was the first female golfer to earn over $100,000 in four consecutive years and the seventh overall to reach the one million dollar mark in career earnings. Between 1969 and 1980, Blalock made the cut in 299 consecutive tournaments, an all-time LPGA Tour record.\nIn 1976, Blalock testified for the LPGA Tour in a suit against a sponsor trying to start a Women's Masters Tournament. Blalock wrote a column for the \"Miami Herald\" in 1981 complaining about the association's overuse of sex appeal in promoting the tour.\nWith 27 LPGA Tour wins, Blalock almost qualified for the World Golf Hall of Fame under the standards in use as of 2011. However, she never won a major championship in her career nor was she ever LPGA Player of the Year or winner of the LPGA Vare Trophy. Blalock would have to be voted in by the Veterans Committee. As of 2018, all eligible golfers with 20 or more wins on the LPGA Tour are in the World Golf Hall of Fame except Blalock. Several golfers who primarily played the LPGA Tour, Hollis Stacy who was inducted in 2012, Judy Rankin and Donna Caponi have fewer career wins than Blalock but have been selected by the Veterans Committee. Blalock said in 2001 \"It's almost a relief that I don't qualify. What if every year my name came up and every year I didn't make it? I'd be thinking, 'is what happened the reason?'\"\nIn July 2014, she was voted into the Legends Hall of Fame."

        "text": "Portsmouth F.C. Basketball Club was a British professional basketball team based in Portsmouth, Hampshire, that played in the top league of UK basketball from 1985 to 1988. They won the league championship in the 1986–87 and 1987–88 seasons and also reached four major cup finals, including those of all three main domestic knockout competitions in 1987–88.\nVirtually all home games were played at the Mountbatten Centre in Portsmouth, which had bleacher seating on either side plus a balcony around one end and one side. Part of the side balcony was reserved for directors and guests. Two matches in 1986–87 and two in 1984–85 were hosted by Havant Leisure Centre (eight miles away), one in 1984–85 by Fleming Park Leisure Centre in Eastleigh (23 miles) and one in 1984–85 by Winchester Recreation Centre (30 miles).\nFormation and 1984–85 season.\nThe club was created when Portsmouth Football Club chairman John Deacon, having failed in a 9 January 1985 bid to buy Eastleigh-based Solent Stars, instead bought another top division club, Telford Turbos, on 16 January and moved it to Portsmouth midway through the 1984–85 season.\nFor an undisclosed sum, Deacon acquired a range of basketball equipment, nine players – Dave Treasure, Steve Nelson, Pat Morrison, Marty Headd (later replaced by Mike Owen), Ian Pollard, Lee Irwin, Dave Harris, Julian Taithe and Dale Shackleford – and the franchise of a club lying bottom of the table after losing all of its 13 league matches up until that point.\nWith no relegation planned from the top division that season, he did not plan an extensive revamp of the team, but he did recruit Danny Palmer as coach on 17 January.\nIn the longer term the club, officially known as Portsmouth FC Basketball Club but simply 'Portsmouth' for promotional purposes, would have its office and players' base at Portsmouth FC's Fratton Park stadium, and use the Mountbatten Centre as its regular home court.\nBut to begin with the players remained based in the Midlands and football club secretary Bill Davis was handed the responsibility of finding dates and venues for the team's eight remaining home games.\nTheir first appearance under the Portsmouth FC banner was an away game on 19 January at Solent, who had gone to Telford earlier in the season and beaten them 123–87 in a match played in a former aircraft hangar.\nThis time a near capacity crowd at Fleming Park saw Portsmouth open an 11-point lead in the first half. Solent came back to lead 50–48 at half-time but midway through the second half Portsmouth led 73–72, before a final burst from the home side gave them a 106–91 victory. Americans Headd (32 points) and Shackleford (24 points) top scored for Portsmouth, while 17-year-old Nelson began a Portsmouth career that would ultimately last as long as the club.\nA burst pipe which delayed work on the Mountbatten Centre's main sports hall floor meant Portsmouth were back at Fleming Park on 26 January, this time for a 'home' clash with league leaders Kingston Kings. Admission prices were set at £2.50 for adults and £1 for juniors.\nPortsmouth had to borrow Kingston's red kit as they only had a white strip available and league rules at the time insisted that away teams wore white. The court was less than half full of spectators and the match did little to create an atmosphere, with Portsmouth trailing 20–8 after five minutes and 51–34 at half-time before finally losing 115–72. Again the Americans led the scoring, Shackleford netting 31 points and Owen 22, with nobody else in double figures for Portsmouth.\nA 91–79 defeat at Doncaster Panthers followed before the team made their Mountbatten Centre debut against Hemel &amp; Watford Royals on 10 February, with one side of the bleachers used. Portsmouth led 23–19 midway through the first half but trailed 56–38 by the interval and eventually lost 104–79. Shackleford and Owen hit 25 and 24 points respectively, while future Portsmouth star Mike Spaid scored 17 for Hemel.\nBill Davis completed his fixture-fixing task on 12 February, giving Portsmouth four different venues for their first four home games by arranging for the Manchester United match to take place at Winchester Recreation Centre. Four days later Danny Palmer signed a two-year contract, with his coaching role to become full-time in April 1985.\nThe trip to Leicester Riders on 16 February ended in a 109–85 loss, but Portsmouth's first appearance at Havant Leisure Centre the following day offered the chance to climb off the foot of the table, if they could beat Bolton &amp; Bury Hawks – who had one win to their name, against the former Turbos – by more than their margin of defeat at Bolton.\nAgain the match was played with seating on only one side of the court, and the initial part-time nature of Palmer's coaching role was illustrated by his absence from the arena as he was already committed to commentating on another game for Channel 4 television that day, but the players defied the low-key nature of the occasion to grab the opportunity. They blasted into a 12–0 lead in the first three minutes, extended this to 21–5 midway through the first half and went in at the interval with a 42–25 advantage.\nAfter the break Treasure and Harris fouled out, and when Irwin dislocated an elbow Portsmouth were down to just six players. But they refused to let Bolton back into the game and secured their first victory at the sixth attempt, the 84–68 scoreline also proving enough to move them off the bottom. Owen scored 23 points, Shackleford 15 and Pollard 11.\nThe euphoria did not survive the trip to Winchester, where Portsmouth lost 96–67 to Manchester United. Shackleford hit 26 for the hosts while another future Portsmouth player, Colin Irish, netted 18 for United. Portsmouth then had a third glimpse of their future in their next away game, with Alan Cunningham starring for the Worthing Bears as they beat Portsmouth 99–87 despite another 32 points from Shackleford.\nA crowd of 300 attended the next home game, an 82–77 defeat by Bracknell Pirates at Havant in which Shackleford added another 38 points to his tally. Danny Palmer then made his first signing in preparation for the 1985–86 season, recruiting guard Joel Moore from Brixton Topcats.\nFour matches remained in the last nine days of the season for this first group of Portsmouth players, three at the Mountbatten Centre sandwiching a Thursday night trip to Manchester Giants.\nJohn Deacon, who joined the team on the bench for the home game with Sunderland Maestros, acknowledged that most of them would not be around the following season due to the club's higher ambitions but was delighted with their attitude and performances in their short time wearing Portsmouth vests.\nThey began this final burst of games on 2 March at home to Crystal Palace. Trailing 54–45 at the interval, Portsmouth tied the second half to eventually lose 103–94, with Shackleford hitting 39 and Owen 24.\nThe following day they ran Sunderland even closer, just 43–41 behind at half-time and briefly ahead 76–73 as the match neared its climax. Shackleford surpassed all his previous efforts by scoring 44 points, but Sunderland had a six-point lead before Treasure sank a three-pointer on the buzzer to narrow their margin of victory to 88–85.\nShackleford scored another 33 at Manchester Giants, who beat Portsmouth 80–73, before the curtain came down at home to Birmingham Bullets on 10 March. A fourth future Portsmouth player, Karl Tatham, appeared against them, scoring 12 points, but the day was all about whether the departing players could record a second victory to say farewell. At half-time it was a possibility, with Portsmouth only down 42–36, but Birmingham extended their lead to 21 points before a late home surge took the final score to 86–79 in the visitors' favour. Owen scored 23 points but for the final time it was the Dale Shackleford show, as Portsmouth's star American defied five stitches in a hand to sign off with 36.\nMajor investment.\nIn the summer of 1985 John Deacon provided the budget to bring a host of star players to the south coast. On 26 April Dan Lloyd was signed from Manchester Giants, along with former Crystal Palace player Joe White who had been at university in the US, to Join the retained Steve Nelson and Dave Harris plus the recently signed Joel Moore. Soon to follow were Alan Cunningham, from Worthing, Colin Irish, from Manchester United, Larry Dassie, Trevor Anderson, Kalpatrick Wells, Andrew Bailey, Eddie Fontaine and Michael Hayles.&lt;ref name=\"Solent85/6\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\n1985–86 season.\nThe new Portsmouth line-up, with an all-blue first choice strip and all-white change colours, played on a green and terracotta roll-out carpet court at the Mountbatten Centre during 1985–86. After remaining unbeaten in a series of friendlies, including one against a German side at the Mountbatten Centre on 8 September, they made a tremendous start to the season, winning their first 16 matches, including 11 in the league. The first match was a 96–91 home National Cup win over Crystal Palace on 20 September 1985, followed by their first league game two days later, an 83–68 home victory over Solent.\nOn 23 October Portsmouth went to the Tolworth Recreation Centre in Surrey and beat league champions Kingston 99–86. There was now a fierce battle for supremacy between these teams which defined Portsmouth's period in the UK game. The easy 65-mile drive up and down the A3 also meant large away followings for both clubs in these matches.\nInterest was rising among the Portsmouth public and on 9 November the home game against Manchester United, another team owned by a football club, was watched by 1,064 people. Led by a 22-point performance from Larry Dassie, Portsmouth won 72–71.\nThe unbeaten run ended in the National Cup semi-finals, which were both held at the Aston Villa Leisure Centre in Birmingham in a 'final four' day on 15 December covered by Channel 4. After following up their first round win over Crystal Palace with a victory away to second-tier side Tower Hamlets and a quarter-final success at Tyneside, they faced another tussle with Kingston.\nBut when Joel Moore suffered serious eye injuries in a road accident, American guard Jose Slaughter was brought in to replace him. This meant an enforced absence for Alan Cunningham, as only two overseas players could be selected for any game, and the revised Portsmouth line-up suffered a 75–92 defeat which denied them a trip to the Royal Albert Hall in London for the final.&lt;ref name=\"PortsmouthDiary86/7\"&gt;Pages 92–94 \"Portsmouth F.C. Official Diary Yearbook 1986/7\" (Published by Eagle Football Diaries Limited, 63b Lansdowne Place, Hove, East Sussex BN3 1FL)&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn the next game, three days before Christmas, mid-table Hemel &amp; Watford Royals inflicted their first league defeat with a shock 82–79 win at the Mountbatten Centre, despite Kalpatrick Wells hitting 20 for the hosts. Another Sunday afternoon home loss followed on 12 January 1986, Leicester Riders pipping Portsmouth 114–113. But six victories in 18 days set up what was expected to be a title decider at home to Kingston on 5 February.\nA crowd of 1,511 crammed into the Mountbatten Centre, standing three deep on the balcony and sitting on the floor in front of the bleachers. Kingston, in red vests and yellow shorts, dominated the early exchanges and took a 2–15 lead, but Portsmouth outscored them by two points to one in the remainder of the first half. They took the lead at 24–21 and held their biggest advantage, 16 points, at 58–42 before a Martin Clark basket made it 58–44 at half-time.\nKingston made some inroads after the break but when Colin Irish sank a three-pointer with 4 minutes 34 seconds to go Portsmouth still looked in control at 103–95. Two quick turnovers then cost them four cheap points, but the hosts regained command at 106–99 with 3 minutes 30 seconds left.\nThe pace of the game then quickened and baskets were traded, but Portsmouth still led 112–109 with 1 minute 23 seconds remaining. Steve Bontrager, who had scored Kingston's previous four points, sank two free-throws to draw Kingston within one, then with 63 seconds on the clock Kalpatrick Wells dunked to make it 114–111 to Portsmouth and drew a foul in the process. Kingston instantly called a time-out.\nWhen the teams returned to the court amid a frenzied atmosphere, Portsmouth allowed victory to slip away. Wells missed his free-throw after the foul, then with 50 seconds remaining Joel Moore fouled Bontrager as he launched a three-point shot. Bontrager made all three from the line to tie the score at 114.\nOn Portsmouth's next offence Dan Lloyd moved deep into Kingston territory, only for Bontrager to steal the ball near the endline. Bontrager dribbled into the Portsmouth half, set up a diversionary play then drove through the lane and shot off the glass to put Kingston 114–116 ahead, their first lead in more than half an hour of play.\nWith five seconds left Portsmouth worked the ball up the court to Irish, who was fouled just outside the three-point line. He hurled up a shot which barely found the backboard in an effort to have it called a shooting foul, but the officials deemed that the foul was committed before the shot. With Kingston in team fouls the rules at the time dictated that Irish, Portsmouth's top scorer on the night with 34 points, would have a 'one and one' – make the first free-throw to receive a second – with one second on the clock.\nIrish's first shot bounced twice on the rim, players of both sides fought for the rebound and eventually Clark pawed the ball to safety as the buzzer sounded. The Portsmouth players disappeared straight out of the arena as the Kingston contingent celebrated on their court.\nWithin three days two more defeats at Brunel Uxbridge and Manchester United had ended Portsmouth's title bid, with United ultimately going on to win the crown. Portsmouth won three of their last four league games to finish third, but Danny Palmer resigned and Alan Cunningham took on a caretaker coach role for the remainder of the campaign.\nPortsmouth played sixth placed Birmingham Bullets in the National Championship – commonly known as the playoffs – quarter-finals, and having opened with a 92–86 away win they had two chances at home to secure the best-of-three series and a trip to Wembley Arena for the 'final four' weekend on 21 and 22 March. But 85–93 and 91–95 defeats ended their hopes and left them with just the British Masters trophy to play for.\nThe British Masters began early in the season, Portsmouth beating lower division sides Caercastell and Plymouth Raiders away in the opening rounds. Victory at home to Bracknell Pirates at the end of October took them into the second qualifying stage in March, when they won 82–74 at Hemel &amp; Watford and finished the job with a 101–99 success in the second leg. That brought a quarter-final with Crystal Palace, and expectations were raised by a comeback from 16 points down to win 108–107 at the National Sports Centre. But again it went wrong at home, and a 106–118 defeat brought a premature end to Portsmouth's season on 26 March 1986.\n1986–87 season.\nThe carpet, original kits and caretaker coach had gone when action resumed, as had many of the team. Slaughter, Dassie, Wells, Bailey, Harris and Hayles departed, while Lloyd became player-coach. New faces were American Danny Williams, Mike Spaid from Hemel &amp; Watford Royals, and Karl Tatham. Trevor Anderson was in the squad at the start but his number 4 vest was later filled by American Lawrence Held.\nThe new team began with a 94–87 home win over Leicester on 20 September 1986, but they suffered a setback at home to Kingston a week later. Steve Nelson missed a free throw with the scores tied at 93 at the end of the game, and the visitors pulled away to win 106–97 in overtime despite a 32-point haul from Colin Irish.&lt;ref name=\"PortsmouthDiary87/8\"&gt;Pages 90–94 \"Portsmouth F.C. Official Diary Yearbook 1987/8\" (Published by Eagle Football Diaries Limited, 63b Lansdowne Place, Hove, East Sussex BN3 1FL)&lt;/ref&gt;\nEleven league wins in a row kept them well in contention for the title but the run ended with an 89–74 defeat in the return game at Leicester on 9 January 1987.\nSix more wins followed before another decisive clash with Kingston at Tolworth on 11 February. Portsmouth needed to win by at least ten points to win the 'head to head' contest with Kingston and move to the top of the league. Colin Irish hit two three-pointers in the opening seconds and Portsmouth ran out 106–88 winners.\nThe title was confirmed when Alan Cunningham made a lay-up with two seconds left to secure a 90–88 victory away to Hemel &amp; Watford at the Dacorum Leisure Centre in Hemel Hempstead on 18 February.\nThe trophy was presented after the final home game two nights later, an 85–90 defeat by Manchester United. All the seating tickets were sold in advance and the balcony began to fill up two hours before tip-off.\nThird place in the league in 1985–86 had given Portsmouth a place in the Korac Cup, and their first venture into European competition brought a 96–76 home win over Yugoslavian side Sibenka on 1 October 1986. The return a week later ended in an 89–62 defeat and a seven-point loss on aggregate.\nThey went much further in the National Cup. Their 121–81 home win over second-tier side Lambeth Topcats, with 24 points from Alan Cunningham, was followed by a comfortable 127–99 success at Hemel &amp; Watford which took them to another Channel 4 semi-final day at the Aston Villa Leisure Centre on 30 November. Karl Tatham's lay-up in the last few seconds saw Portsmouth squeeze past Calderdale Explorers 82–78&lt;ref name=\"Solent86/7\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to set up a final against holders Kingston at the Royal Albert Hall on 15 December.\nColin Irish was forced to miss the game with a knee injury, and in his absence Danny Williams led Portsmouth's first half scoring with 11 points as Kingston took a 51–41 advantage into the interval in front of a crowd of 4,200. For the fifth and final year in a row Channel 4 showed the second half live, and Alan Cunningham got their coverage off to a flying start with a dunk straight from the tip-off.\nBaskets were traded in the early stages of the second half and with 12 minutes 20 seconds left Kingston led 64–56. Then a Steve Nelson jumper, a bank shot from Joel Moore, another jumper from Danny Williams and an 18-foot effort from Nelson suddenly drew Portsmouth level at 64 and forced Kingston coach Kevin Cadle to call a time-out with 10 minutes 47 seconds remaining.\nAfter the resumption a three-pointer from Moore and a jumper from Karl Tatham kept Portsmouth in touch, trailing only 71–69, but then Dan Davis, Doug Lloyd and Steve Bontrager stretched the lead again to 78–69 and Portsmouth coach Dan Lloyd asked for a time-out with 7 minutes 37 seconds on the clock.\nKenny Scott's jumper from the corner then stretched Kingston's lead to 11 points, and although Mike Spaid, Cunningham, Tatham, Moore and Williams kept the scoreboard ticking over for Portsmouth, they could not get back to within one basket of their opponents.\nCunningham's put-back made it 86–81 with four minutes left, but Doug Lloyd's three-pointer and Davis's bank shot then gave Kingston a ten-point cushion. A pair of free-throws from Cunningham, a floater from Williams and a Spaid jump shot dragged Portsmouth back to 91–87 with 58 seconds to go, but that was the end of their challenge as Martin Clark finished the scoring with two free-throws and a lay-up from a Bontrager pass to clinch a 95–87 win for Kingston.\nAlan Cunningham was Portsmouth's top scorer with 20 points, followed by Danny Williams (18) and Mike Spaid (16). Kingston captain Steve Bontrager, accompanied by his two children, was presented with the National Cup, and the Most Valuable Player award went to Dan Davis.&lt;ref name=\"EBBAp129/130\"&gt;Pages 129–130 \"English Basketball Association National Competitions Handbook 1999/2000\"&lt;/ref&gt;\nAfter clinching first place in the league Portsmouth wrapped up their playoff quarter-final with eighth placed Hemel &amp; Watford in two games, and turned their attention to the British Masters while waiting for Wembley weekend. Birmingham and Derby Rams were eliminated to set up yet another meeting with Kingston in the semi-final. Portsmouth lost 107–103 at Tolworth but led by four points at the end of normal time at the Mountbatten Centre on 25 March. As the two-legged tie was decided on aggregate, the second leg went into overtime. Again Portsmouth held a four-point lead at the buzzer, but Kingston got the upper hand in a second period of overtime, eventually winning the game 135–133 and the tie by six points.\nPortsmouth played BCP London in the first playoff semi-final at Wembley Arena on 3 April, and fell to a 106–102 defeat against a BCP side inspired by Argentinian star Julio Politi. They earned some consolation the following day by beating Manchester United 99–89 in the third place match.\nAn 'International All Star' tournament was held at the Mountbatten Centre on 29 and 30 December, featuring Portsmouth, Solent, Sao Paulo from Brazil and the Australian Institute of Sport. Portsmouth beat the Australians 104–44 in their semi-final and then defeated Solent 103–95 in the final.\nLarry Dassie, who had left Portsmouth just a few months before, died in a road accident in December 1986. As a tribute to him, and to raise some money for his family, the Larry Dassie Testimonial Match was held at the Mountbatten Centre on 12 April 1987. The players of Portsmouth and Kingston suspended hostilities for the evening and formed two mixed teams who produced a 114–114 tie.\n1987–88 season.\nDan Lloyd finally swapped tracksuit for suit in 1987–88, concentrating solely on coaching. Held, Fontaine, White, Moore and Williams also left the playing staff. Coming in were Americans Marc Glass and Kenny Stancell, soon to be replaced by Rich Strong, local star Jason Colgan, Roy Lewis and Russell Taylor. Larry Dassie's number 8 vest, vacant since he left the club at the end of 1985–86, was officially retired as a further tribute to him.\nPortsmouth played five games in five days in France&lt;ref name=\"Solent87/8\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to prepare for the new season, clocking up 1,400 miles of travelling as they pitted their talents against French top division clubs. They lost to Tours and Gravelines in the first and last matches but won two of the other three.\nThey started their title defence with a 102–88 win at Solent on 19 September 1987, but a week later Manchester United pinched a 70–69 victory at the Mountbatten Centre to leave the champions playing catch-up again.\nIn their next league match Portsmouth gained instant revenge on Manchester United with an 81–73 win in the away game to start a run of seven successive league victories.\nThe sequence ended with a 99–82 hammering at Kingston on 25 November, but that was to prove Portsmouth's last-ever league defeat, as they reeled off 18 more league wins in a row to clinch back-to-back titles.\nFor three months though it was looking like a fruitless pursuit of Kingston, until Calderdale recovered from a poor start to win 89–82 at Tolworth on 14 February 1988.\nThis meant that six nights later Portsmouth needed merely to beat Kingston at the Mountbatten Centre to take over at the top, rather than having to repeat the previous season's 18-point success to win the head-to-head.\nJust like two years previously the balcony was packed, although this time a row of advertising boards prevented anyone sitting on the floor. The visitors wore a more conventional all-yellow strip and their supporters waved and released dozens of matching balloons, many grabbed and burst by some of the more partisan young Portsmouth supporters. At regular intervals the tunes of the 'Pompey Chimes' and Mike Oldfield's 'Portsmouth' were played on a drum and an amplified glockenspiel.\nThis pivotal clash matched the quality and pace of the 1986 encounter, but with more emphasis on defending and less long runs of scoring. Portsmouth edged into a 17–13 lead, Kingston responded to go up 23–24, the scores were level again at 35 then Portsmouth regained a four-point advantage, going into half-time leading 43–39.\nWith 11 minutes 20 seconds to go Portsmouth led 65–59, but they were held scoreless for more than two minutes as Kingston levelled at 65. Marc Glass and Steve Bontrager traded long two-pointers, then a Mike Spaid dunk and a Colin Irish basket gave Portsmouth daylight at 71–67 before a Bontrager three pulled Kingston back to within a single point.\nSpaid made it 73–70 but Irish's fourth foul could not stop Kenny Scott, whose free-throw drew Kingston level with 4 minutes 20 seconds left. Paul Stimpson then gave Kingston a 73–75 lead before Alan Cunningham took over, sinking four consecutive free-throws then stealing the ball and racing away for a lay-up to put Portsmouth 79–75 clear with 2 minutes 39 seconds remaining.\nColin McNish made one from the line and Dan Davis laid up to bring Kingston back to 79–78, then Rich Strong sank a pair of free-throws to edge Portsmouth clear again at 81–78.\nWith a minute remaining former Portsmouth star Joel Moore, who had received a frosty reception from the home fans on his return, tied the scores at 81 with a three-pointer from the top of the key.\nBut with just 48 seconds left McNish fouled out and Strong made both free-throws to put Portsmouth up 83–81. A desperate shot from Moore was blocked and Portsmouth broke clear, drew another foul and sank one final free-throw to win 84–81 and prompt joyous scenes among the home support.\nThere was still a little work to do, but victory at Livingston meant a 94–80 win at Bolton &amp; Bury Giants on 27 February retained the crown. The trophy was presented after a 109–57 last league game win over Crystal Palace at the Mountbatten Centre on 4 March.\nIn Europe, Portsmouth went to Czechoslovakia, where Zbrojovka Brno took a decisive 94–76 lead after the first leg of their European Cup tie. Portsmouth gained some consolation with a 97–95 win in the return, but lost by 16 points on aggregate.\nPortsmouth reached the National Cup final again with home wins over Bracknell Tigers (85–82), Sunderland 76ers (98–88) and, in a non-neutral semi-final, Manchester United (107–90), with Colin Irish scoring 27 points.\nBut a chipped bone in his right hand threatened Irish's participation in the final for the second year running, and reliable bench man Mike Spaid had only returned to training after an ankle injury just five days before the Royal Albert Hall encounter with Kingston on 14 December.\nA sell-out crowd of 6,000 and the Channel 4 cameras saw Portsmouth start with a line-up of Marc Glass, Steve Nelson, Alan Cunningham, Karl Tatham and Rich Strong against a Kingston starting five of Dan Davis, Steve Bontrager, Colin McNish, Joel Moore and Martin Clark.\nThe opening ten minutes of the first half passed with the scores tied at 18, but a lay-up and free-throw from Clark and a three-pointer by Bontrager suddenly opened a 26–18 lead for Kingston. Strong's lay-up brought it back to 26–20 before Irish entered the game with a strapped hand 7 minutes 10 seconds from half-time.\nSpaid carried the scoring load for Portsmouth, netting their next six points with a tip-in, lay-up and jump shot, before Cunningham hit another jumper to keep them in touch at 33–28. Clark then sank two free-throws and Moore a three-pointer to pull Kingston clear again at 38–28 with 2 minutes 48 seconds remaining in the half.\nCunningham dunked off a Tatham drive to make it 38–30, then Scott and Tatham exchanged jump shots before Irish went off without scoring as Portsmouth trailed 40–32. Spaid hit two free-throws before Davis dunked off a Scott pass to bring the curtain down on the first half with Kingston leading 42–34.\nA fast start to the second half saw Kingston leading 64–52 with just over 13 minutes left. Tatham hit a three-pointer but Moore went straight up the other end to hit another, his fifth from five attempts. Spaid, Mike Griffiths, Cunningham, Bontrager, Strong, Moore and Tatham all contributed to an exchange of baskets before Moore sank his sixth successive three-pointer and forced Portsmouth coach Dan Lloyd to call a time-out with his team trailing 76–63.\nWhen play resumed Clark extended Kingston's lead to 15 points with a pair of free-throws, but a Cunningham put-back from a rebound sparked a Portsmouth revival. Irish, who earlier in the match was so hampered by his injury that he resorted to taking and missing a one-handed free-throw with his left hand, drove through the lane to make it 78–67 and suddenly it was Kingston coach Kevin Cadle calling a time-out with 7 minutes 7 seconds left.\nTatham's jump shot and a Roy Lewis lay-up hauled Portsmouth back to 78–71, then Cunningham took over with a reverse dunk off a drive, two free-throws and a bank shot to close the gap to just 80–77 with 3 minutes 49 seconds remaining.\nBut Moore then hit his seventh three-pointer, Strong missed a pair of free-throws and Clark sank two from the line, effectively ending the contest at 85–77 before Kingston ran out 90–84 winners. Steve Bontrager, this time with only one of his children, lifted the trophy and Joel Moore received the MVP award.\nPortsmouth travelled to the Granby Halls in Leicester for the 'Tournament of Champions' on 1 January 1988, but after holding a 13-point lead in their semi-final with Kingston they unravelled to an 86–93 defeat in the last three and a half minutes.\nThe League Cup replaced the British Masters in 1987–88, and after home and away group stage victories over Solent and Bracknell, Portsmouth once again met Kingston in a semi-final. Portsmouth won the first leg at the Mountbatten Centre 94–87 on 23 March, but three nights later at Tolworth they trailed 80–72 with one second left and were seemingly heading out of the competition.\nThen Karl Tatham was fouled attempting a three-point shot on the buzzer. After lengthy discussion among the officials Tatham was awarded three free throws. He sank the first two then threw the third up towards the ceiling to celebrate Portsmouth's one-point aggregate victory.\nMarc Glass hit a three-pointer from the halfway line at the end of the first half of the final against Livingston at the Aston Villa Leisure Centre on 30 March, but that proved Portsmouth's high point of the evening as the Scottish side took the trophy with a 96–91&lt;ref name=\"BBLp21/22\"&gt;Pages 21–22 \"Basketball League 1996/7 Handbook\"&lt;/ref&gt; win.\nHome and away wins over eighth placed Solent in the playoff quarter-finals took Portsmouth back to Wembley Arena for the 'final four' weekend on 9 and 10 April, and this time they won their semi – beating Manchester United 98–90 – to ensure they achieved the hat-trick of major final appearances that season. But once again there was disappointment as Livingston inflicted another defeat, this time 81–72.\nSudden end.\nShortly after the season concluded John Deacon announced his intention to move his franchise to the newly built Rivermead Leisure Centre in Reading, then in May 1988 he sold Portsmouth Football Club. With nobody offering to finance a basketball club in either Portsmouth or Reading, ownership of the franchise reverted to the league. Portsmouth FC Basketball Club's financial affairs were formally wound up in April 1989.\nCunningham and Irish's coastal tour.\nAlan Cunningham and Colin Irish maintained their south coast links during the rest of their careers. Together with Steve Nelson and Mike Spaid they formed the core of the Worthing Bears' top tier title winning side in 1992–93. They also found the secret to winning major knockout competitions, with three playoff titles and a National Cup before departing in 1996. Having played to the east of Portsmouth for Worthing, they then went west to Eastleigh in 1997, taking Solent to a third tier championship in 1997–98 and a second tier title in 1998–99.\nIrish made his last competitive appearance for Solent in a 63–80 second tier playoff final defeat against Teesside Mohawks at Wembley Arena on 6 May 2000, and his final game in England before moving to the United States came at the Mountbatten Centre on 30 May 2000, when he scored 15 points in a 103–100 overtime friendly victory for a Portsmouth Pirates Select side against the University of Gettysburg.\nCunningham, who scored 38 points in that game, had been due to retire too, but when Solent struggled with a young team the following season he made a comeback. His last game, at the age of 47, came in another second tier playoff final against Teesside, this time at the Coventry Skydome on 12 May 2002. Solent lost 117–127 in double overtime but Cunningham played superbly, scoring 29 points, and in a fitting end to his career he had the ball in his hands as the final buzzer sounded.\nLeague tables.\n1985–86.\n\"(Crystal Palace were deducted one point)\"\n1986–87.\n\"(One of the Hemel v Bolton fixtures was not played and Bolton were deducted one point because of this)\"\nCompetitive results.\n1984–85.\n\"(Results and fixtures are incomplete for the Telford Turbos era but are complete from the start of the Portsmouth FC era on 19 January TEL – Home match while still Telford Turbos FP – Fleming Park Leisure Centre HLC – Havant Leisure Centre WRC – Winchester Recreation Centre)\"\n1985–86.\n\"(AVLC – Aston Villa Leisure Centre)\"\n1986–87.\n\"(*Recorded at as 105–97 HLC – Havant Leisure Centre AVLC – Aston Villa Leisure Centre RAH – Royal Albert Hall WEM – Wembley Arena)\"\n1987–88.\n\"(*Later renamed Crystal Palace RAH – Royal Albert Hall GH – Granby Halls AVLC – Aston Villa Leisure Centre WEM – Wembley Arena)\""

        "title": "2011–12 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2011–12 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team represented Harvard University in the Ivy League athletic conference during the 2011–12 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team played its home games in Boston, Massachusetts at the Lavietes Pavilion, located across the Charles River from the university's main campus in Cambridge with a capacity of 2,195. The team was led by fifth-year head coach Tommy Amaker and senior co-captains Keith Wright and Oliver McNally.\nHarvard began the season 8–0, the best start by an Ivy League team since won its first ten games to begin the 1969-70 season. On December 5, 2011, Harvard made its first-ever appearances in the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll, ranking 25th and 24th, respectively. The season included two wins against teams in the powerhouse Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).\nHarvard set a school record with 26 wins during the season and tied a school record for conference wins with 12. Its 14 non-conference wins also tied an Ivy League record previously held by the 2009-10 Cornell Big Red. The season culminated in an invitation to the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, where Harvard lost in the second round. It was Harvard's first NCAA tournament appearance since 1946 and third consecutive appearance in a postseason tournament. Junior Kyle Casey was a first-team All-Ivy selection, while junior Brandyn Curry and senior Keith Wright earned second-team recognition.\nPreseason.\nHarvard came into the 2011-12 season off of its first Ivy League championship and two school record-setting years in terms of total wins. The 2010–11 team that won the league championship during the 2010–11 Ivy League men's basketball season had no seniors. Ivy League Men's Basketball Player of the Year Keith Wright returned to the team as a senior, as did All-Ivy League juniors Kyle Casey, Brandyn Curry and Christian Webster. Harvard entered the season with a 17-game home winning streak, the 10th-longest in the country. Senior co-captain Oliver McNally entered the season with a 32-shot free throw streak, having finished second in the nation in free throw percentage the previous year.\nThe upperclassmen on the team came from the first top-25 recruiting class in Ivy League history. Harvard and Wright won numerous preseason honors. Wright was a preseason John R. Wooden Award Top 50 Watchlist honoree as well as a Lou Henson Preseason All-America team selection. Harvard was selected as the conference preseason favorite for the first time in school history. In addition, Harvard received preseason votes in the AP Poll, marking the fourth straight season it received votes at some point in the year.\nThe team's schedule included power conference opponents Boston College (ACC), Utah (Pac-12) and Connecticut (Big East) as well as a possible second-round Battle 4 Atlantis match against Florida State (ACC). Expectations were high for Harvard, and a December 8 contest against Connecticut was the only Ivy League game scheduled for broadcast on ESPN2 during the season.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#991111; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Regular season\n \n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#991111; color:#FFFFFF;\"| 2012 NCAA Tournament\nRankings.\nOn December 5, 2011, Harvard made its first-ever appearance in either the AP (25th) or Coaches' Poll (24th). That left Brown as the only Ivy League school never to have been ranked in the AP Poll and left only seven Division I schools active since the poll began that have never been ranked in it. Harvard was the first Ivy League team ranked in the Coaches' Poll since the 2009–10 Cornell Big Red and the first Ivy League team ranked in the AP Poll since the 1997–98 Princeton Tigers. By January 2, the team achieved rankings of 22nd in the AP Poll and 21st in the Coaches' Poll. On February 6, the team again attained the ranking of 21st in the Coaches' Poll.\nSeason.\nHarvard's season began with a Crimson Madness event on October 15 where the team raised a 2010–11 Ivy League Championship banner and held an intrasquad scrimmage. The team opened the season with a victory over on November 11 that extended Harvard's win streak against MIT to nine games.\nFollowing the victory over MIT, Harvard took part in the 2011 Battle 4 Atlantis Tournament. The team beat Utah 75–47 in the first game of the tournament, its first-ever win against a Pac-12 Conference opponent. On November 25, Harvard faced Florida State, which was then ranked 22nd in the AP poll and 20th in the Coaches' Poll. Harvard won that game 46–41 for the second-ever defeat of a ranked opponent in team history. Harvard then matched up against UCF in the tournament final, winning 59–49. Wright earned Ivy League player of the week for his performance in the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament. McNally extended his free-throw streak to 51 in the Florida State victory, but his run ended in the final minutes of the UCF game.\nThe 2008–09 team had previously defeated then-ranked Boston College (17th in the AP Poll and 24th in the Coaches' Poll) for the first win over a ranked team in the program's history, but lost to all ranked opponents in the 2009–10 and 2010-11 seasons. The win against Boston College was the 1000th in school history. The Florida State victory was the school's second over a ranked team in its history and the highest-ranked opponent in the Coaches' Poll that Harvard has ever defeated. Florida State went on to win the 2012 ACC men's basketball tournament.\nHarvard began the season 8–0, the best start by an Ivy League team since won its first ten games to begin the 1969-70 season. Harvard, then ranked 25th in the AP poll and 24th in the Coaches' poll, next faced its most formidable challenge yet: Connectucut, which then had a 7–1 record and was ranked 9th in both polls. Harvard had the better record against common foes, Florida State and UCF (2–0 versus 1–1). Connecticut won the teams' previous meeting at Harry A. Gampel Pavilion in 2009 by a score of 79–73 as the 2009-10 Huskies (then ranked 14th in the AP Poll and 13th in the Coaches' Poll) survived a 30-point, 9-rebound effort by Jeremy Lin. Harvard lost the 2011 meeting 67–53.\nHarvard won its next four games, including victories over and Boston College for a season sweep of city rivals after beating MIT in November. Harvard's victory over Boston College was its fourth in a row against the Atlantic Coast Conference team, giving it five consecutive wins overall against ACC teams, including its only two wins against ranked opponents. After rising to 21st in the Coaches' Poll and 22nd in the AP Poll, Fordham upset Harvard 60–54 in January. A 65–35 win over Yale three weeks later was Harvard's widest margin of victory against its Ivy League rival in 183 meetings. Harvard lost its third Ivy League game of the season, falling to Princeton on February 11, but avenged the loss in a home win on February 24. That victory gave Harvard a new school record for single-season wins as well as single-season non-league wins and tied the record for conference game wins. A day after beating Princeton, however, Harvard lost to Penn, snapping a 28-game home winning streak dating to February 20, 2010. Nonetheless, Harvard finished the season with a 26–4 overall record. The team won Ivy League regular-season title and earned its first invitation to the NCAA tournament since 1946. Harvard entered the tournament with a 2–1 record against teams in the field and was seeded 12th in the East Region. Harvard lost in the second round of the tournament to fifth-seeded Vanderbilt on March 15 by a score of 79–70.\nHarvard set a school record by selling out 10 of 12 home games at Lavietes Pavilion (the sellouts came in all seven Ivy League matchups, as well as versus MIT, Saint Joseph's, and George Washington). All five of Harvard's starters and 12 total players returned from the previous year's championship team, but freshmen accounted for over 22% of minutes played in the 2011-12 season. By sweeping its four games against Massachusetts rivals, Harvard extended an in-state winning streak to 14 games. The program also defeated teams from a record-setting 11 conferences, plus an independent. Other school records set during the season included best Ivy League start and most road wins, with 12. Harvard's 14 non-conference wins in the regular season tied an Ivy-League record.\nHonors.\nIn-season.\nEach week the Ivy League selected a player of the week and a rookie of the week.\nPostseason honors.\nKyle Casey and Keith Wright were selected by the U.S. Basketball Writers Association to its 10-man All-District I (ME, VT, NH, RI, MA, CT) team, while Tommy Amaker was named the All-District I Coach of the Year. The National Association of Basketball Coaches announced its Division I All‐District 13 team on March 14, recognizing the nation’s best men’s collegiate basketball student-athletes. Keith Wright was a first-team selection, while Kyle Casey was a second-team selection. Wright was also selected to participate in the NABC 2012 Reese's Division I All-Star Game at the 2012 NCAA Tournament final four.\nThe following players earned Ivy League postseason recognition:"

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball first-round draft picks",
        "text": "Major League Baseball (MLB) is the highest level of play in North American professional baseball, and is the organization that operates the National League and the American League. In 2000, the two leagues were officially disbanded as separate legal entities, and all of their rights and functions were consolidated in the commissioner's office. Since that time, MLB has operated as a single league, and constitutes one of the major professional sports leagues of the United States. It is composed of 30 teams.\nThe First-Year Player Draft, also known as the Rule 4 Draft, is MLB primary mechanism for assigning amateur baseball players from high schools, colleges, and other amateur baseball clubs to its teams. The first draft took place in 1965; it was introduced to prevent richer teams from negotiating wealthier contracts with top-level prospects and therefore, monopolizing the player market. Originally, three drafts were held each year. The first draft took place in June and involved high-school graduates and college seniors who had just finished their seasons. The second draft took place in January for high school and college players who had graduated in December. The third draft took place in August and was for players who participated in American amateur summer leagues. The August draft was eliminated after two years, and the January draft lasted until 1986.\nThe draft order is determined based on the previous season's standings, with the team possessing the worst record receiving the first pick. In addition, teams that lost free agents in the previous off-season may be awarded \"compensatory\" picks.\nNational League.\nEastern Division.\nAtlanta Braves.\nThe Atlanta Braves National League franchise originated in Boston, Massachusetts in 1871. The team has played in three different cities: Boston (1871–1952), Milwaukee, Wisconsin (1953–1965), and Atlanta, Georgia (1966–present). Since the establishment of the draft in 1965, the Braves have selected 55 players in the first round. Of those 55 players, the Braves have selected 26 pitchers, eight outfielders, seven shortstops, five catchers, four third basemen, three first basemen, and two second basemen. Four of these players, Kent Mercker, Steve Avery, Chipper Jones, and Mike Kelly, were part of the 1995 World Series championship team. The team's 1974 selection, Dale Murphy, won consecutive National League Most Valuable Player Awards (NL MVP) in 1982 and 1983, the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award in 1985, and the Roberto Clemente Award in 1988. Bob Horner, the Braves' 1978 selection, won the National League Rookie of the Year Award in the same year. Chipper Jones, drafted by the Braves in 1990, won the NL MVP Award in 1999. The Braves have held the first overall pick twice; in 1978 they used it to select Horner, and in 1990 they chose Chipper Jones.\nMiami Marlins.\nThe Marlins franchise entered the National League in 1993 as an expansion team, and was known as the Florida Marlins until 2011. Of the 24 players picked by the Marlins in the first round, 13 have been pitchers. Four outfielders were selected and two players each were taken at first base, third base, and catcher. The Marlins have also drafted one shortstop in the first round, though they have never taken a second baseman. Two of the Marlins' first-round picks have won championships with the franchise. Charles Johnson (1992) won a World Series title on the 1997 championship team and Josh Beckett (1999) won with the 2003 team.\nNew York Mets.\nThe successor to two previous National League franchises in New York City (the Giants and the Dodgers), the New York Mets have played in Queens since 1964, when they vacated the Polo Grounds in Manhattan and moved to Shea Stadium.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nThe National League franchise in Philadelphia was established in 1883 following the dissolution of the Worcester Worcesters.

Since the institution of MLB's Rule 4 Draft, the Expos/Nationals have selected 66 players in the first round. Thirty-two have been pitchers, the most of any position; 22 of them were right-handed, while 10 were left-handed. Thirteen outfielders, nine shortstops, five third basemen, four catchers, and three first basemen were also taken.\nCentral Division.\nChicago Cubs.\nThe Chicago Cubs franchise began as the Chicago White Stockings in 1876, with Albert Spalding as the franchise's inaugural manager.\nCincinnati Reds.\nSimilar to their division counterparts, the Cincinnati Reds were established as the Cincinnati Red Stockings in 1882.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nEstablished in 1969 as the Pilots in Seattle, Washington, the team moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin the following season, which brought top-flight baseball back to Wisconsin for the first time since the Braves departed after the 1965 season.

Since that time, MLB has operated as a single league, and constitutes one of the major professional sports leagues of the United States. It is composed of 30 teams.\nOpening Day is the day on which professional baseball leagues begin their regular season. For MLB and most of the minor leagues, this day falls during the first week of April. For baseball fans, Opening Day serves as a symbol of rebirth; writer Thomas Boswell once penned a book titled, \"Why Time Begins On Opening Day\". Many feel that the occasion represents a newness or a chance to forget last season, in that the 30 major league clubs and their millions of fans begin with 0-0 records.\nBeing named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season. It is often given to the pitcher who had the best season the year prior, though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day.\nNational League.\nEastern Division.\nAtlanta Braves.\nThe Atlanta Braves National League franchise originated in Boston, Massachusetts in 1871.

The team currently plays in the Segunda Superior, the fifth division of the Unión de Rugby de Buenos Aires league system.\nHistory.\nBy 1976 a group of veteran rugby players decided to create a club where to play the sport they loved. On March 3, 1977, Club Argentino de Rugby was founded, with the participation of children from 8 to 12 years old and their parents also collaborating with the project.\nAt first, they trained in a little square, moving then to a football field rented to the \"Asociación Cristiana de Jóvenes (Youth Christian Association)\" and finally in Club Arsenal de Sarandí. Argentino's home games were played in a rented field owned by the Dirección Nacional de Vialidad (the organism that regulates the roads of Argentina), which was located in Ezeiza, Buenos Aires.\nThe first jerseys were sold in a pharmacy and the administration office worked in a little room of the Círculo Universitario de Avellaneda.\nThe team promoted to first division in 1987 and 1997 but would be later relegated to a lower category. In 2011 Argentino was relegated to third division."

        "text": "Perry Victor Moss (born November 11, 1958) is an American former National Basketball Association (NBA) basketball player.\nPlaying career.\nCollege.\nMoss played basketball at Northeastern University under coach Jim Calhoun, where he averaged 15.2 points per game and 3.7 rebounds per game in four seasons there. In his senior season, Moss was named the America East Conference Player of the Year in 1981–82. Moss graduated as the school's second-leading career scorer with 1,722 points and a 15.2 average in 113 games. In 1982, he went head-to-head with future NBA All-Star Dominique Wilkins and the Georgia Bulldogs in the first round of the Gotten State Classic. Despite a big game from Moss, the Huskies lost, but Los Angeles Lakers General Manager Jerry West, who was in attendance, noted that Moss was the best guard he had seen that year.\nOn his home court, Moss would dazzle the fans with his acrobatic dunks created by his 41-inch vertical leap. As a junior in 1981, Moss teamed with guard Pete Harris to lead the Huskies to their first of seven conference titles. His career included a number of clutch shots, including Moss's halfcourt bomb that sent the championship game versus Holy Cross into overtime, which Northeastern won 76–69. He also hit a last-second shot in the opening round of the NCAA tournament when Northeastern knocked off 20th ranked Fresno State before bowing out to Utah. Moss and the Huskies repeated the feat a year later, as Moss averaged 23.7 points per game. Northeastern defeated Saint Joseph's 63–62 in the first round, before dropping a triple-overtime contest to Villanova in the second round. Moss scored 23 and 31 points respectively, in those two games. For his career, Moss scored over 30 points eight times.\nProfessional.\nMoss was drafted with the 23rd pick in the third round of the 1982 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics, but he was released before playing a single game. Prior to the 1983-84 NBA season Moss was signed by the New Jersey Nets, but was once again released before playing a single game. He played three years in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) before making his NBA debut for the Washington Bullets in the 1985-86 NBA season. He was released mid-season. Moss finished the 1985–86 season by playing for the Philadelphia 76ers. After the season, Moss was once again released, but he did play for the Golden State Warriors in 1986–87. On September 27, 1989, he was signed by the Orlando Magic, but was waived before the start of the regular season. In total, he played in 136 NBA games and averaged 3.9 points and 1.5 assists.\nMoss spent the next decade playing with a string of CBA teams, including the La Crosse Catbirds and the Topeka Sizzlers (1988–1989), Rockford Lightning (1991–1992), Yakima Sun Kings (1993–1994), Hartford HellCats (Player/Coach 1994–1995), and the Connecticut Pride (Player/Coach 1995–1996).\nIn all he played on ten CBA teams in eleven years, and finished his CBA career in 1995 playing for the Connecticut Pride team that also featured future UConn coach Kevin Ollie in his rookie season. At the age of 39, he finished his final professional basketball season in 1997 playing for the Norwich Neptunes of the Atlantic Basketball Association.\nPersonal.\nHe is the brother of Peter Moss, a former college player for Brown who was the 1980 Ivy League Player of the Year. They also have a sister, Paula Moss, who graduated in 1982 as Tufts University's all-time leading scorer with 1,018 points (since surpassed).\nOn May 22, 2013, it was announced that Moss would be inducted into the New England Basketball Hall of Fame as part of its Class of 2013."

Games are played between November 1 and April 30 against \"TRBL-sanctioned\" teams. League teams are free to schedule as many games as they choose. All teams who play at least 10 sanctioned games are eligible for the playoffs.\nAs a result of the change, five members (Carolina Gladiators, Fayetteville Crossover, PrimeTime Players, Queen City Express, and South Carolina All-Stars) left the league. Those teams would go on to form the East Coast Basketball League.\nIn August 2015 the Premier Basketball League and TRBL announced an expanded partnership which included six TRBL teams to compete as the PBL South East Division. Teams included are Cary Invasion, Charlotte Elite, Durham Legacy, Huntersville HoopForLyfe and Wilmington Sea Dawgs.\nAfter the 2016 season Lumberton Showstoppers announced that they were joining the ECBL.

        "text": "Eric William Lewis (20 September 1909 – 17 April 1959) was an Australian rugby league footballer who played in the 1930s. A New South Wales interstate and Australian international representative forward, he played club football in the NSWRFL for South Sydney, winning the 1932 Premiership with them, and later coaching them.\nPlaying career.\nLewis started playing for Waverley's Christian Brothers club before spending a season playing in Griffith in 1931. He then returned to Sydney, and joined South Sydney Rabbitohs, where he would remain for six seasons. At the end of the 1932 NSWRFL season, Lewis' first in the top grade, he played in the premiership Final for Souths, scoring a try in their 19–12 victory over Western Suburbs.\nLewis played for Souths in the 1935 NSWRFL season's premiership final loss to Eastern Suburbs. After that he toured New Zealand with the Australian national team, becoming Kangaroo No. 200.\nInternational.\nLewis was a member of the 1937–38 Kangaroo touring side to England and France. The French leg of this tour helped establish rugby league in France.\nPost-playing.\nAfter returning from war duties in early 1945, Eric Lewis stepped in to coach Souths for the 1945 NSWRFL season at a time when many players and coaches were absent because of the war. The South Sydney Rabbitohs line up was so disrupted, that no constant club captain was named during the season. Often, the captain was named on game day depending on who was available to play. The club only won one game during 1945.\nIn Papua New Guinea during World War II, Lewis spotted Jack Rayner playing inter-regiment rugby league on a muddy field at Port Moresby and invited him to trial with South Sydney when he got home. Rayner went on to captain and coach Souths, becoming an important figure in the club's history.\nLewis was long time resident of the Baine family's Dolphin Hotel in Surry Hills, New South Wales and lived there until his death which was widely mourned by South Sydney fans. He was buried at Botany Cemetery on 20 April 1959."

        "text": "The South African Rugby Union (founded 1966) was a non-racial governing body for rugby union in South Africa that aligned itself with the anti-apartheid movement. Previously known as the South African Coloured Rugby Football Board, SARU was a founder member of the South African Council on Sport and so strongly opposed the inter-racial structures of the South African Rugby Board (SARB). After the end of apartheid SARU combined with SARB in 1992 to form the South African Rugby Football Union, now known as the South African Rugby Union.\nSARU's predecessor was the South African Coloured Rugby Football Board, founded in 1897 during South Africa's British colonial period as a national rugby governing body for players of colour. The SACRFB emerged from a meeting of all clubs and unions called to Kimberley by the Griqualand West Colonial Rugby Football Union. Black administrators like Bud Mbelle had earlier persuaded Cecil John Rhodes to provide a trophy like the Currie Cup to \"'all the coloured Sporting People if South Africa'\". The SACRFB then organized a domestic rugby competition for the Rhodes Cup, which started in 1898 and was first won by Western Province.\nAfter the South African Rugby Football Federation broke away from the Coloured Rugby Football Board to ally themselves with the white South African Rugby Board in 1966, the remaining members changed the name to the South African Rugby Union (not to be confused with the current body of that name). In 1973 SARU became a founding member of the anti-apartheid South African Council on Sports, whose slogan argued that there could be no normal sport in an abnormal society.\nSARU's predominantly coloured composition changed when they were joined by the mostly black Kwazakhele Rugby Union (Kwaru), itself a breakaway from the Port Elizabeth African Rugby Board. Kweru had initially wanted to affiliate with the black South African African Rugby Board but were rebuffed. Other black sporting bodies then followed Kwaru's lead."

        "title": "2012 Roger Federer tennis season",
        "text": "Roger Federer's 2012 tennis season officially began on 2 January with the start of the 2012 ATP World Tour. Federer began the year with a semifinals finish at the Australian Open after a four-set loss to archrival Rafael Nadal. He recovered from his loss with three consecutive titles at the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament, the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, and the BNP Paribas Open. He won his fourth title at the Mutua Madrid Open on blue clay, becoming the only person to win a title on blue clay in ATP history. By doing so, he regained the #2 ranking from Rafael Nadal At the French Open, Federer played four tough matches before he was ousted by Djokovic in the semifinals.\nThe highlight of Federer's season came at the 2012 Wimbledon Championships, where he made a dramatic comeback at two sets down in the third round Julien Benneteau and carried momentum from his win to win a seventh Wimbledon title over native British favorite Andy Murray, in the process tying Pete Sampras's record of Wimbledon titles and clinching his record-setting seventeenth Grand Slam. His win at Wimbledon also saw him return to the World No. 1 ranking, and saw him breaking Sampras's record of weeks at World No. 1. Federer went on to win his first Olympic singles medal at the 2012 London Olympics, winning silver.\nFederer then won his third Masters 1000 title of the season and his twenty-first overall at the Western &amp; Southern Open. He was upset in the quarterfinals of the US Open by Tomáš Berdych. Federer finished his season at the ATP World Tour Finals, where he lost to Djokovic in a tight final. Federer ended his season with six calendar titles, a Grand Slam title, 3 Masters 1000 titles and an Olympic silver medal. Federer also represented Switzerland in the Davis Cup, and helped Switzerland to advance to the 2013 Davis Cup World Group.\nThe 2012 season was a return to form for Federer. He had his most match wins (71) since 2006, and his highest winning percentage (86%) and number of titles won (6) since 2007. The two most significant accomplishments of his season included winning a record seventeenth Grand Slam title (his first since the 2010 Australian Open) and returning to World No. 1.\nYear summary.\nEarly hard court season and Australian Open.\nQatar Open.\nFederer began his ATP World Tour season at the Qatar Open, where he was defending his title. After straight-set victories over 2011 finalist Nikolay Davydenko and qualifier Grega Žemlja, Federer won a hard-fought, error-prone match over eighth-seeded Andreas Seppi. Federer was scheduled to play Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in a rematch of the previous year's semifinal, but was forced to withdraw due to a back spasm problem. This marked only the second time in Federer's career (after the 2008 Paris Masters) that he withdrew from a tournament because of injury.\nAustralian Open.\nFederer next traveled to Melbourne for the first Grand Slam of the season, the Australian Open. The Swiss advanced through the first four rounds without the loss of a set, starting his campaign by defeating qualifier Alexander Kudryavtsev, receiving a walkover into the third round when Andreas Beck withdrew with a lower back injury prior to their second round match, and beating Ivo Karlović to improve to a 10–1 head-to-head record against the Croat. Federer then faced Australian teenager Bernard Tomic and downed him in less than two hours to extend his record streak of Grand Slam quarterfinals consecutive appearances to 31.

After receiving a bye into the second round, he faced American qualifier Denis Kudla, and dispatched him in straight sets. He next faced young up-and-coming Canadian Milos Raonic. Raonic grabbed a tight first set after winning the set tiebreaker, but Federer came back strong with two break points in the second set to level the match. Federer found a break point late in the third set and held to secure a close three-set win over Raonic. Still recovering from his illness, Federer played Brazilian Thomaz Bellucci, who had received a walkover from the third round, the day after his match with Raonic. Bellucci took advantage of a shaky Federer to win the first set, but Federer found his rhythm and fought back to win the next two sets and the match with two crucial break points, one of which was also match point. Federer then played Juan Martín del Potro for the fourth time in the season in the quarterfinals.

He next faced Juan Martín del Potro for the fifth time in the season. After del Potro broke Federer in the first set and won a set tiebreak to take a two set lead, Federer capitalized on a waning del Potro to win the next three sets and take the match in three hours and fourteen minutes. Federer advanced to his thirty-first Grand Slam semifinal with his seventh career win from two sets down and his third at the French Open. He next played first-seeded Novak Djokovic. In a match with constant breaks of serve, Federer lost in straight sets because of inconsistent play and copious errors, which included failing to convert on an early second-set lead.\nGrass court season, Wimbledon, and the Olympics.\nHalle Open.\nFederer began his 2012 grass court season at the Halle Open in Halle, where he was a five-time champion and was the second seed.

Federer managed to break del Potro after twenty games, but was unable to convert the break, and del Potro broke back to continue the pattern. Eventually, Federer engineered another break at seventeen games all, and held serve to win the match on his second match point. The match, which stretched over four hours and twenty-six minutes, broke the record for the longest best-of-three-sets system match in the Open Era, surpassing the 4 hours and 3 minutes in Rafael Nadal’s victory over Novak Djokovic in the 2009 Madrid Masters.\nFederer, who secured his first Olympic medal and Switzerland's first medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics with his semifinal win, played Briton Andy Murray in the final. Federer was unable to find a way to control the match, and saw his serve broken five times en route to a loss in straight sets, which resulted in earning him a silver medal. The match was a nightmarish match for Federer, where he won just seven games and scored a minuscule ten points on his own second serve. It was Federer's worst ever loss on grass, and overall second worst in a best of five sets match, next only to 2008 French Open final to Rafael Nadal. Federer’s finals finish, along with World No. 2 Novak Djokovic's semifinals finish, guaranteed that he would retain his World No. 1 ranking.\nIn the doubles tournament, Federer teamed up with Stanislas Wawrinka to defend their gold medal from the 2008 Summer Olympics. They first faced the Japanese duo of Kei Nishikori and Go Soeda, and dropped the first set tiebreak to them. However, Federer and Wawrinka rallied to win the next two sets and the match, successfully beginning their medal defense. The pair next played Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram of Israel, and grabbed a one-set lead after winning the first set in less than half an hour. However, they were edged by Erlich and Ram in the second-set tiebreak, and fared poorly in the third set, giving up a break of serve which ultimately lost them the match.\nUS Open Series and US Open.\nFederer was scheduled to open this season's US Open Series by participating in the Rogers Cup in Toronto, but he withdrew from the tournament, citing a need for rest.\nCincinnati Masters.\nFederer opened his US Open Series at the Western &amp; Southern Open in Cincinnati, where he finished in the quarterfinals last year. Federer first faced Alex Bogomolov, Jr. of Russia, and found little trouble in his first match, dropping only five games en route to a win in one hour. In the third round Federer faced Australian Bernard Tomic, defeating the 19-year-old while only dropping six games. Federer next faced American Mardy Fish in a rematch of the 2010 Cincinnati final. His quarterfinal against Fish was a high quality match with Federer closing it out in a second-set tiebreaker. His semifinal match was an all Swiss affair as he faced friend and doubles partner Stan Wawrinka. Wawrinka pressed Federer to a tiebreaker but ultimately succumbed to the world number 1 in straight sets. With his victory over Wawrinka, Federer secured the number ranking going into the US Open. He faced world number 2 Novak Djokovic in the final, and started the match strong, winning six straight games to open with a one-set lead in 20 minutes. He then played a tight second set with Djokovic, and won the set and the match in a tiebreaker. With his win, Federer won his record fifth title at Cincinnati and did so without losing a serve or dropping a set for the entire tournament.\nUS Open.\nFederer next played at the US Open in Flushing Meadows, where he finished in the semifinals last year. Federer faced American Donald Young in the first round and defeated him in straight sets in just over an hour and a half. He next faced German Björn Phau, and faced little resistance, breaking Phau five times en route to a straight-sets victory in exactly an hour and a half. Federer then played Fernando Verdasco of Spain, and won again in straight sets, winning in just over two hours. He was scheduled to play American Mardy Fish in the fourth round, but Fish withdrew, citing health concerns. Federer played Tomáš Berdych in the quarterfinal, and dropped the first two sets before regaining some momentum and winning the third set. However, Berdych forced a break of Federer's serve, and served out the match, handing Federer his first loss in eight matches. Federer's loss also ended his eight consecutive semifinal appearances at the US Open since 2004.\nAsian Swing.\nShanghai Masters.\nFederer's first post-US Open tournament was the Shanghai Masters. Federer received a bye into the second round, where he played Lu Yen-hsun and won the match in straight sets after securing one break point in each set. In the third round, Federer faced off against compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka. He dropped the first set to Wawrinka, but won a crucial second-set tiebreak and finished the match by winning six straight games in the third set. Federer's win over Wawrinka guaranteed him the world No. 1 ranking for a 300th week. Federer's next match in the quarterfinals, against Marin Čilić, saw him taking control of the match from the start, winning in straight sets in just over eighty minutes. Federer next played Andy Murray in the semifinals, but a few anomalies in his service gave breaks of serve to Murray in the first and second sets, resulting in a straight sets loss.\nEuropean Indoor Season.\nSwiss Indoors.\nFederer's next tournament was the 2012 Swiss Indoors, where he was seeded first and was a two-time defending champion. He played Benjamin Becker in the first round, and won in straight sets after overcoming Becker in a tight first set. He then faced Thomaz Bellucci in the second round, and won the first set before dropping a tight second set tiebreak. He then fought off a comeback by Bellucci, and won the match with a break of Bellucci's serve in just over two hours. Federer played Benoît Paire of France in the quarterfinals, and swept past him in straight sets, dropping only one point on serve en route to a win in less than an hour. In a tougher semifinal, Federer dispatched Paul-Henri Mathieu in straight sets, advancing to his ninth Basel final and equalling John McEnroe's 875 career match wins. Federer played Juan Martín del Potro in the final, and found himself one set down after del Potro broke his serve in the middle of the first set. Federer fought back in the second set, saving a break point late in the set to force a tiebreak, which he won. However, he was not able to keep his seven-match win streak against del Potro, dropping the match in a third-set tiebreak after failing to convert break points earlier in the set.\nParis Masters.\nFederer was scheduled to play at the BNP Paribas Masters, where he was the defending champion, but elected to withdraw, citing a need to rest ahead of the World Tour Finals. Federer's withdrawal, coupled with his loss in the final of the Swiss Indoors, led to the loss of his World No. 1 year-end ranking to Novak Djokovic.\nATP World Tour Finals.\nFederer next played at his eleventh ATP World Tour Finals, where he was the two-time defending champion. He was drawn into Group B, which included David Ferrer of Spain, Juan Martín del Potro of Argentina, and Janko Tipsarević of Serbia. He first faced Tipsarević, and dropped only eight points on serve en route to defeating him in straight sets in an hour and nine minutes. With his win over Tipsarević, Federer recorded his fortieth ATP World Tour Finals win, surpassing Ivan Lendl's record of ATP World Tour Finals win. Federer then played Ferrer, and beat him in a tight second-set tiebreak after Federer clinched the first set on a break of Ferrer's serve. Federer's win marked his fourteenth consecutive win over Ferrer and also qualified him for the semifinals. Federer played del Potro to wrap up the round robin, and found himself one set down after del Potro clinched a first-set tiebreak. Federer broke del Potro early in the second set, and held the lead to level the match at one set all. However, del Potro responded by breaking him early in the third set, and Federer's unforced errors ultimately cost him the game and the match. Federer's loss meant that his streak of 12 matches won at the ATP World Tour Finals was broken. Even with the loss, Federer finished first in the group, and advanced to the semifinals, where he faced Andy Murray, who he had last played at the Shanghai Rolex Masters. Murray started out strong, breaking Federer in the first game of the set, but Federer recovered by breaking Murray later in the set. The first set eventually went to a tiebreak, and Federer found himself with two set points, converting the second to take a one-set lead. Federer then flew through the second set, breaking Murray twice en route to winning the match in just over an hour and a half. With his win, Federer advanced to his eighth final, where he played Novak Djokovic. Federer held an early lead in the first set, but Djokovic managed to level the set and ended up pulling out to a one-set lead after winning a very tight first-set tiebreak. In the second set, Djokovic was able to convert a decisive break point on Federer's serve late in the set and he subsequently served out the match to win his second end of season championship. The loss denied Federer a chance to tie Ivan Lendl's record of three consecutive ATP World Tour Finals titles. Federer's loss also cost him a chance at tying John McEnroe's record of 77 career titles won.\nDavis Cup.\nFederer returned to Switzerland to represent his country for their first-round Davis Cup meeting with the United States. He played his first rubber at Fribourg against John Isner after Mardy Fish had beaten his compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka in the first rubber. After taking the first set, Federer struggled to capitalize on break points and lost the next three sets to Isner, giving the Americans a 2–0 advantage. He next played with Wawrinka in the doubles rubber against top doubles player Mike Bryan and Fish. Federer and Wawrinka won a tight first set, but were run over by Bryan and Fish in the next three sets, losing the rubber and the match-up. The Americans advanced to the quarterfinals, while Switzerland was relegated to the World Group play-offs. Federer was scheduled to play Mardy Fish in the first of the reverse singles rubbers, but Federer and Fish were taken off the schedule, as the Americans had already won the match-up.\nFederer represented Switzerland in the World Group play-offs against the Netherlands in Amsterdam. Federer played Thiemo de Bakker in his first singles rubber, and he won the match in straight sets, giving Switzerland its first point. After compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka secured a four-set victory over Robin Haase in the second singles rubber, Federer and Wawrinka teamed up to play the doubles rubber against Haase and Jean-Julien Rojer. Because of strong play by Haase and Rojer, Federer and Wawrinka found themselves in a two-set to love deficit, but they fought to win the third set. However, Haase and Rojer continued to break the Swiss pair's serves and won an upset in four sets, preventing Switzerland from clinching the match-up on the second day of play. Federer then played Haase in the first of the reverse singles rubbers, and found little trouble in winning the match in straight sets, fending off various opportunities for Haase to break his serve. Federer's win clinched the match-up, which meant that Switzerland would play in the World Group in 2013.\nTournament schedule.\nSingles schedule.\nFederer's 2012 singles tournament schedule was as follows:\nYearly records.\nHead-to-head matchups.\nRoger Federer had a match win–loss record for the 2012 season. His record against players who were part of the ATP rankings Top Ten at the time of their meetings stands at . The following list is ordered by number of wins:"

        "text": "Alec Michael Davis (23 January 1942 – 10 May 2022) was an England rugby union player and head coach. He played rugby as a lock in his youth for Torquay Athletic RFC and represented the county of Devon before being selected for his first England cap in 1963. He remained in rugby all the rest of his life, continuing to coach youth and senior teams in his home town of Sherborne.\nEarly life and rugby career.\nDavis was born in Lichfield and went to Torquay Boys' Grammar School before training as a teacher at St Luke's College, Exeter, where he was studying when he was first selected for the England team in 1963. He also studied at the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth and HMS Raleigh. In club rugby he played for the Devonport Services R.F.C., Harlequins and the Combined Services team. He played for the Devon and Staffordshire county rugby teams and was captain when Staffordshire won the 1969–70 Rugby Union County Championship. He also played water polo and basketball.\nInternational career.\nPlayer.\nHis arrival on the international scene as a player was significant enough that he was profiled in the December 1963 issue of Rugby World magazine.\nHe was a teacher and coach at Sherborne School (1974–2002) where, alongside Phil Jones between 1975 and 1978, he coached the school to four unbeaten seasons with 35 out of 35 school matches being won. Only a handful of games were lost during a coaching partnership which spanned six seasons.\nCoach.\nHe was appointed head coach of England for the 1979/80 season, the only England senior coach ever appointed on the merits of their achievements as a school coach rather than a club coach. His international coaching career spanned four seasons to the end of the 1982/83 season. In his first season as coach England won the Grand Slam in the 1980 Five Nations Championship.\nSchool and club coach.\nHe coached England in a strictly amateur era and as such he continued to teach and coach at Sherborne School. With the formation of Sherborne RFC in the early 1980s he was soon enlisted to help raise the standard of play at this burgeoning club and he coached a variety of sides within the Senior and Junior section on-and-off over a period of thirty years.\nPersonal life.\nDavis died in May 2022, at the age of 80."

        "text": "The Cornell–Princeton lacrosse rivalry is a college lacrosse rivalry between Princeton University and Cornell University and their respective men's lacrosse teams, Princeton Tigers and Cornell Big Red. The rivalry stems from the dominance of the two programs in the Ivy League where in the first 66 seasons (1956 through 2023 seasons, excluding pandemic canceled years of 2020 and 2021) Cornell has won 32 Ivy League Championships (20 outright, 12 shared) and Princeton has won 27 league titles (18 outright, 9 shared). The next nearest team is Brown with 11 titles (five outright, six shared) The Ivy League awards the league championship to the team with the best record at the conclusion of the regular season. In the event two or more teams are tied with identical records the title is shared with no tie breaking mechanism. The teams shared the title in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2010 (also with Brown and Yale) and 2015 (also with Brown).\nCornellBigRed.com describes the rivalry as \"The marquee matchup in Ivy League lacrosse\". Cornell claims three NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championships (1971, 1976, 1977) and four pre-NCAA era national championships (1903, 1907, 1914, 1916). Princeton claims six NCAA championships (1992, 1994, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2001) and six pre-NCAA era national championships (1884, 1885, 1937, 1942, 1951, 1953). The most recent Ivy League title for Cornell was in 2024 while Princeton's most recent title was 2015 which they shared with Cornell and Brown with identical 4-2 records.\nAlthough the two schools have a long rivalry, they did not oppose each other in postseason play until the quarterfinals of the 2009 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship at Hofstra University's Shuart Stadium. Cornell won 6–4. In 2010, Princeton defeated Cornell 10–9 in the inaugural Ivy League lacrosse championship tournament and received the league's automatic berth to the 2010 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship. Cornell would win the 2011 Ivy League tournament, defeating Harvard 15-6 in the final. Princeton would defeat Cornell in the semifinals of both the 2013 and 2015 tournaments but would fall to Yale in the championship game both times. Cornell would win the Ivy League tournament again in 2018 and therefore has two titles to Princeton's one although both trail Yale's five tournament championships.\nThe teams first met in 1922, with Princeton winning 11–1. The series is currently tied 42–42–2 over 86 games. \nRival Accomplishments.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs."

        "text": "Lahore Rugby Football Club is a Division I Pakistani rugby union club based in Lahore, Pakistan. \nIn 2012, it was one of three Pakistani clubs - the others being Islamabad Rugby Football Club and LUMS Rugby Football Club - to participate in the Dubai Sevens tournament in the United Arab Emirates.\nHistory.\nThe Lahore Rugby Football Club (LRFC) was founded in the summer of 1991, and was registered in 1992. At that time, a large contingent of expatriates was present in Lahore, working for multinational companies, foreign missions and foreign aid agencies. \nA similar situation also existed in Islamabad and Karachi. From the outset, all these three clubs started a regular exchange of rugby matches and an annual Pakistan Rugby Sevens event also evolved from their regular exchange of fixtures.\nThe presence of skilled expatriate players on the team lent support in recruiting and training of more local players. The LRFC was able to maintain a steady stream of local players as the expatriate population in Lahore waned due to the political-cum-economic scenario of the country. By 1995/96, LRFC could boast of a full contingent of local rugby players and has maintained this status ever since.\nThe reduction in the expatriate members in the game also reduced the team's ability to attract sponsorship. Lahore, despite this handicap, maintained an active calendar each season due to hard work and dedication of its members. The club started to expand its horizons by participating in regional tournaments in the Gulf and South Asia. LRFC became a regular participant at the prestigious Dubai 7's Rugby Tournament (1997-present) event and participated twice in Sharjah 10's (1999 &amp; 2001). Since 1995, LRFC has also been a regular participant at the All India &amp; South Asia Rugby 15's Tournament in India, but currently its participation is restricted due to the political tensions between Pakistan and India. The club has also traveled to India, for events other than All India Tournament, and to Sri Lanka as well.\nLRFC has organised an annual rugby 10's Tournament eight times on its own (1999-2006). The club hosts teams from Sri Lanka and India in this tournament on a regular basis. The club committee planned to introduce an international invitational Rugby 7's tournament on annual basis starting in 2019.\nThe LRFC currently competes in the Servis Tyres Division I Rugby competition, against four other teams, including Pakistan Army, Islamabad Jinns, Lahore Hawks and Lodhran."

        "text": "David Lee Adams (born May 15, 1987) is an American former professional baseball infielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees in 2013.\nPrior to playing professionally, Adams competed on travel teams and for Grandview Preparatory School in Boca Raton, Florida. He attended the University of Virginia, where he played college baseball for the Virginia Cavaliers.\nAmateur career.\nAdams played in amateur baseball tournaments from a young age, winning the championship in a 12-and-under travel competition for a team representing Broward and Palm Beach counties, against a team representing California's Central Valley, at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. Chris Volstad was a teammate.\nAdams attended Grandview Preparatory School in Boca Raton, Florida. A second baseman for the school's baseball team, Adams batted .464 with 25 runs batted in (RBI) and 17 stolen bases as a sophomore. He was named captain and MVP of the team. Major League Baseball scouts followed Grandview Prep to see Adams.\nAdams committed to attend the University of Virginia, to play college baseball for the Virginia Cavaliers baseball team. \"Baseball America\" rated Adams as the second-best high school third baseman in the United States. The Detroit Tigers chose Adams in the 21st round of the 2005 Major League Baseball Draft, but, disappointed with where he was selected, he opted not to sign, instead enrolling at Virginia.\nIn his freshman year, Adams became the Cavaliers' regular starting second baseman. He had a .318 batting average with five home runs and 49 runs batted in (RBI), and was named a Freshman All-American by \"Baseball America\" and Louisville Slugger. As a sophomore, in 2007, he had a .372 batting average and a .454 on-base percentage, earning Second-Team All-Atlantic Coast Conference honors. In 2006, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Brewster Whitecaps of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and returned to the league in 2007 to play for the Falmouth Commodores.\nAdams played for the Cavaliers for three years, starting each season at second base. In his three years, Adams had a .325 batting average, and placed in the all-time top ten for the Cavaliers with 226 hits, 142 runs batted in, and 102 walks. The Cavaliers reached the NCAA Division I baseball tournament in all of Adams' three years at Virginia.\nProfessional career.\nNew York Yankees.\nOut of Virginia, the New York Yankees selected Adams in the third round (106th overall) of the 2008 Major League Baseball Draft. Adams signed and made his professional debut that year with the Class-A Short Season Staten Island Yankees.\nAdams played for the Class-A Charleston RiverDogs and Class-A Advanced Tampa Yankees in 2009. He began the 2010 season with the Class-AA Trenton Thunder, but suffered an ankle injury in May. The injury was originally thought to be a sprain and the organization had him try to rehab the injury for two months.\nAt the 2010 MLB trade deadline, the Yankees and Seattle Mariners almost completed a deal that would have sent Adams, Jesús Montero, and Zach McAllister to the Seattle Mariners for All-Star pitcher Cliff Lee. When the teams shared medical reports, the Mariners determined that Adams' ankle was broken, not sprained. As a result, they chose to trade Lee to the Texas Rangers in a package centered around Justin Smoak. Adams was shut down for the season after the discovery and only appeared in 39 games that year.\nStill rehabilitating from his ankle injury, Adams played for Tampa and the Rookie-level Gulf Coast Yankees in 2011. He was put on the disabled list three times due to the ankle. Adams was added to the Yankees' 40 man roster after the 2011 season to protect him from the Rule 5 draft.\nAdams spent the 2012 season with the Trenton Thunder of the Class-AA Eastern League, where he hit .306/.385/.450 over 383 plate appearances. He played in only 86 games, as he missed time due to back spasms. After the regular season, the Yankees assigned Adams to play in the Arizona Fall League, where he played second and third base.\nOn March 26, 2013, the Yankees released Adams to make space on the team's 40-man roster for new acquisition Vernon Wells. The Yankees re-signed him to a minor league contract three days later. After playing in 27 games for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders of the Class AAA International League, in which he batted .316, the Yankees purchased his contract on May 15, the first day he was eligible to be promoted to the majors. Adams made his major league debut on May 15, 2013, and got his first career hit.\nOn May 16, 2013, Adams got his first career double and RBI. On May 20, 2013, Adams hit his first major league home run off Freddy García in a game against the Baltimore Orioles. He played in 35 games with a .190 average, 2 home runs, and 9 RBI until being demoted to Triple-A on July 8, 2013. Adams got promoted again from Triple-A on July 24, 2013, after Luis Cruz was put on the DL. He was sent down on July 28, 2013, to make room when Jayson Nix was activated off the disabled list. On August 5, 2013, with Derek Jeter going on the DL, Adams was recalled again from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. He was then optioned back to Triple-A on August 11, 2013, in exchange for pitcher Dellin Betances. On September 1, 2013, Adams was called up for a fourth time with the Yankees this season. After the season, Adams was non-tendered by the Yankees, making him a free agent.\nCleveland Indians.\nOn December 13, 2013, Adams signed a major league deal with the Cleveland Indians. He was placed on outright waivers on March 22, 2014.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nAdams was claimed off waivers by the Baltimore Orioles on March 22, 2014. He played 100 games in the minors for the Orioles AAA and AA minor league teams.\nMiami Marlins.\nOn February 11, 2015, Adams signed a minor league contract with the Miami Marlins. He played the entire year with the Marlins AA Affiliate.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nHe played 57 games for the Aguilas del Zulia of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League during the offseason. On November 23, 2015, Adams signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays that includes an invitation to spring training. Adams only played 68 games with the Buffalo Bisons. He became a free agent on November 7, 2016. In the off season he played 16 games for the Tigres de Aragua of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League.\nCoaching career.\nAdams became the defensive coach for Gulf Coast Yankees in 2017. He served as the team's manager in 2018. In 2019, Adams was named the manager for Staten Island. In 2020, he was hired as the manager of the Tampa Tarpons.

From a prominent rugby union family, he played for Canterbury as a wing-forward.\nPlaying career.\nMcPhail arrived in England aboard the S.S. \"Arawa\", on 15 November 1909, together with Lance Todd. Both players signed for the Wigan club and McPhail played his first match for Wigan in the A team against Widnes on 27 November 1909.\nHe was unable to break into the first team at Wigan and on 2 September 1910 he was transferred to St. Helens, joining fellow New Zealanders Arthur Kelly and Herbert Turtill. McPhail made his début for St Helens against Oldham Bears on 3 September 1910 however he made just ten appearances for the club and left at the end of the season.\nMcPhail returned to New Zealand and became active in growing rugby league in his home country. On 13 July 1912 McPhail was present at a meeting that founded the Canterbury Rugby League and he was part of the very first Canterbury side when it played Wellington at the Show Grounds on 7 September 1912, losing 4-5. The next week they lost 5-28 to the touring New South Wales side before recording their first win, against Hawkes Bay in Napier, 10-8.\nMcPhail was involved in the foundation of the Sydenham club on 7 February 1913 and became the club captain. That year, Sydenham won the Canterbury Rugby League's inaugural competition over twelve rounds."

        "title": "Duke–Michigan men's basketball rivalry",
        "text": "The Duke–Michigan men's basketball rivalry is a college basketball rivalry between the Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team of Duke University and Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team of the University of Michigan. The two teams played annual, regularly scheduled contests between 1963 and 1970 and between 1989 and 2002. They also scheduled meetings in 2007 and 2008 and had a 2013 ACC–Big Ten Challenge contest as the most recent meeting. In addition, the teams have had five unscheduled meetings in tournaments, three of which were in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament including the 1992 National Championship Game. Two of the five tournament meetings occurred in 2011.\nIn March 2011, the rivalry was refueled by media commentary related to the ESPN Films documentary entitled \"The Fab Five\". The latest meeting between the teams occurred in the 2013 ACC–Big Ten Challenge, a game on December 3, which Duke won, 79–69.\nHistorical overview.\nDuke regards the rivalry as far less significant than the Carolina–Duke rivalry. The Duke–Michigan rivalry is fueled by the fact that both institutions strive to be premier academic institutions with solid reputations for producing scholars and student athletes rather than just athletic powerhouses. Duke and Michigan have played one another in men's basketball 30 times. The teams have played twice in the same season three times: 1963–64, 1991–92, and 2008–09. Michigan has played Duke more times than they have any other school outside of the state of Michigan that has never been a member of the Big Ten Conference. In turn, Duke's 30 games against Michigan are the most they have played any other school outside of the Maryland-Virginia-North Carolina-South Carolina region that has never been a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Eight of the meetings between Duke and Michigan have featured opponents both ranked in the top ten in the AP Poll; six times both teams were ranked in the top five. Michigan has not faced any of its fellow conference members as many times with both participants so highly ranked.\nThe Cazzie Russell-led 1963–64 Wolverines were known for its \"Bloody Nose Alley\" defense, while the Jeff Mullins-led 1963–64 Blue Devils were regarded as a team that \"played in tuxedos\". Duke had lost National player of the year, NBA first overall selection, NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player Art Heyman from the previous year's final four team. The rivalry began on December 21, 1963, when the 1963–64 Wolverines hosted the 1963–64 Blue Devils at the Yost Fieldhouse, while winning 83–67. Duke starting center Jay Buckley had been described in the press as the weak link in the loss, earning the nickname \"Link\" from his teammates. That Duke team avenged the game later in the season in the 1964 NCAA Final Four with a 91–80 victory. Buckley contributed 25 points and 14 rebounds against 19 points and 9 rebounds from Bill Buntin. After the tournament defeat, the 1964–65 Wolverines came back with double-doubles from Russell, Buntin and Oliver Darden to defeat the 1964–65 Blue Devils 86–79 the following December. The teams met every December until 1970, when they went 19 years without playing.\nStarting in 1989, the teams renewed their annual rivalry games. The defending national champion Terry Mills/Rumeal Robinson/Loy Vaught-led 1989–90 Wolverines hosted the 1989–90 Blue Devils at Crisler Arena with a 113–108 overtime victory, which began annual December contests that continued until 2002. The Christian Laettner/Grant Hill/Bobby Hurley-led 1991–92 Blue Devils were defending national champions during the 1991 contest against the Fab Five-led 1991–92 Wolverines and won in overtime by an 88–85 margin. These teams held a rematch at the 1992 NCAA Final Four that Duke won by a 71–51 margin to repeat as national champions. Another memorable finish was when the 1996–97 Michigan team's Robert Traylor made the game winning dunk with three seconds left against the 1996–97 Duke Blue Devils. On the same day Charles Woodson won the Heisman Trophy against Peyton Manning, making for a memorable Michigan sports day. The 2000–01 Wolverines made a show of a pregame stomp on the Duke Blue Devil's logo before the tipoff. The NBA talent-laded 2000–01 Blue Devils responded by opening the game with a 34–2 run to open the game. During this run, Tommy Amaker served as an assistant to Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski until 1997 and then became Michigan head coach of the 2001–02 Wolverines and 2002–03 Wolverines who lost 104–83 and 81–59, respectively before the annual contests ended.\nThe teams scheduled December contests in both 2007 and 2008 and have also met in tournaments in 2008 and 2011. The unranked 2008–09 Wolverines completed a pair of back-to-back victories over top five opponents with an 81–73 victory over the 2008–09 Blue Devils, marking the first time Michigan had accomplished the feat. The game included 11 lead changes and 16 ties. The close contest allowed the fans to play a part as they forced Duke to use a time out to quiet the noisy crowd late in the second half.\nOn March 13, 2011, the ESPN Films' \"The Fab Five\" debuted as the highest-rated ESPN documentary of all time. The film spawned critical commentary in a broad spectrum of media outlets which include leading newspapers such as \"The New York Times\", \"The Wall Street Journal\" and \"The Washington Post\"; leading periodicals such as \"Forbes\"; online forums such as \"Slate\"; and leading news outlets such as MSNBC. In particular, the film sparked an exchange of words war between Jalen Rose and Duke University's Grant Hill through the media regarding issues of race in sports and education. Among those critical of the racial commentary was Duke player Grant Hill, who was cited in an Associated Press story that ran in major national media outlets. Hill blogged on \"The New York Times\" with a response naming a litany of Dukies castigated by Rose's general aspersions. His response was at the top of \"The New York Times\" \"most-emailed list\" for several days and was shared on Facebook by nearly 100,000 people within its first few days. King responded to Hill in \"The Wall Street Journal\", clarifying that his feelings about Duke were what he felt as a teenager and not representative of his current beliefs. Coincidentally, the following week, 2011 editions of Michigan and Duke met in the third round of the 2011 NCAA Men's Division I basketball tournament. The press described this event as the renewal of the rivalry although people associated with both institutions downplayed the relevance of the film.\nOn March 15, 2015, ESPN Films released another \"30 for 30\" documentary entitled \"I Hate Christian Laettner\" in which both Laettner and his Duke teammate and roommate Brian Davis also responded to Rose's earlier remarks. Brian Davis replied, \"You know, they talk all this Uncle Tom sh** and, you know, I'm like, I'm more hood and street than any mother f***** on that team. To say that about us, we knew it was ridiculous. Because they all wanted to go to Duke. Chris Webber visited Duke and stayed with me.\" Laettner continued: \"Not all of us at Duke were from the entitled families. I wasn't. Bobby Hurley wasn't. Thomas Hill wasn't. Brian Davis wasn't. The only person that was, was Grant Hill. Besides that, we were blue collar kids, too.\"\nAlthough the schools do not share geographic proximity, which would induce frequent recruiting battles, there have been some high-profile recruits that were heavily targeted by both institutions. Chris Webber, Michigan's Mr. Basketball in 1991 and the National High School player of the year, chose Michigan over Duke and eventually became the #1 pick in the 1993 NBA draft after playing two seasons for the Wolverines. Duke returned the favor by gaining a commitment from Michigan-raised Detroit Country Day alum Shane Battier, the 1997 Mr. Basketball of Michigan, who led Duke's 2001 National Championship team, while sweeping all of the National Player of the Year awards. Battier had been a fan of the Fab Five growing up. More recently, Michigan landed Mitch McGary, who had visited only Michigan, Duke and University of North Carolina.\nIn the 2013 contest, 10th-ranked Duke entered the game playing its 220th consecutive contest as a top-10 team in the AP poll and defending a 106-game consecutive non-conference home game winning streak. 22nd-ranked Michigan entered the game having played 80 consecutive games (44 consecutive weeks) as a ranked team. Coming off a loss to Arizona, Duke was at risk of it first consecutive non-conference losses since November 1999 and its first ever ACC–Big Ten Challenge home loss in six contests. However, Duke bounced back to win 79–69 behind 24 points and 9 assists from Quinn Cook. Michigan's loss and fall from the polls ended the sixth longest active streak of poll membership.\nGame results.\nSource:\nA 1964 NCAA Final Four\nB 1992 NCAA Championship Game\nC 2008 2K Sports Classic\nD 2011 NCAA Round of 32\nE 2011 Maui Invitational Tournament Semifinal"

He was the team's starting quarterback in 1984 and set school records for single-game and career passing yards.\nCollege.\nHochberg is from State College, Pennsylvania, and his father, Jim, was a sports medicine coordinator at Pennsylvania State University. During his first two years at Rutgers – 1982 and 1983 – Eric was a back-up to starting quarterback Jacque LaPrarie. On October 1, 1983, Hochberg played against Penn State and set the Rutgers single-game record for passing yards, with 367; the record was broken five years later. Hochberg finished the 1983 season with 61 completions in 100 pass attempts, 841 yards, and four touchdowns.\nIn 1984, Hochberg was Rutgers' primary quarterback. He led the team to a win over 18th-ranked West Virginia on November 10, throwing for 163 yards and one touchdown. For the season, he completed 162 of 305 passes for 1,905 yards and nine touchdowns. He led the team in both passing yards and total offense yards (1,818) and was named \"Most Courageous Athlete of the Year\" by New Jersey sportswriters. Rutgers had a record of 7–3.\nIn 1985, Hochberg lost some playing time to fellow quarterback Joe Gagliardi, who led the team in passing yards that year. Rutgers finished 2–8–1, and Hochberg was 79 for 169 passing with 752 yards and four touchdowns. He ended his Rutgers career with 337 completions in 639 attempts and 3,825 total passing yards. The passing yards mark was a Scarlet Knights record until it was broken Scott Erney in 1988."

The New South Wales Ice Hockey Association is a branch of Ice Hockey Australia.\nHistory.\n1911: Club hockey begins in New South Wales.\nThe beginnings of club hockey in New South Wales occurred at the Sydney Glaciarium in 1911 and consisted of 3 original ice hockey clubs. \n1922: New South Wales Ice Hockey Association.\nFrom the Sydney Ice Hockey Club, the New South Wales Ice Hockey Association was formed, considered the first proper governing body in New South Wales for ice hockey. The original Sydney Ice Hockey Club decided to split up into 4 different teams under an association, the teams were:\nThe intention was to hold competitions during the ice skating season and pick a New South Wales state representative team to play against Victoria for the Interstate Ice Hockey Series. The first match organised was a combined match where the North Sydney and South Sydney team would combine to play against the Eastern Suburbs and Western Suburbs combination team.\nNational Competition.\n1909: The Goodall Cup.\nThe first inter-state ice hockey championship was held between a state representative team from Victoria and from New South Wales. This tournament was a best-of-3 format and saw Victoria win the series 2 games to 1. New South Wales was represented by a newly formed team in 1909 and traveled to Melbourne on 29 August 1909 which marked the first national interstate competition for senior men's hockey in Australia. \nThis was the year that 16-year-old John Edwin Goodall donated the J. E. Goodall Cup to the interstate series, the Victoria state team won the inaugural tournament to become the first Goodall Cup Champions, with Robert Jackson as the captain, who scored 3 goals in the second half of the final game.\nThe first game of the series had a final score of 2-1 with New South Wales defeating Victoria. Friday 3 September 1909 the Victorian team defeated the New South Wales team 1-0, giving Victorian goaltender Charles Watt the first recorded shutout in Goodall Cup history. In the third game of the series both teams had won a game each. Victoria defeated New South Wales 6-1 and became the first team to win the interstate championship in Australia and the first to be awarded the Goodall Cup.\nBefore World War I, which interrupted the Goodall Cup series in 1914, New South Wales won 2 out of 5 Goodall Cup championships held between 1909 and 1913. Jim Kendall dominated the Victorians in his first 2 years with New South Wales, helping them win 2 Goodall Cups back to back.\nWhen the Goodall Cup tournament resumed in 1921, New South Wales would win but Victoria would win the following year in 1922, captained by John Edwin Goodall. This was Victoria's last Goodall Cup win until 1947 where New South Wales would dominate the Goodall Cup inter-state tournaments.\nIn 1952 the tournament expanded with the introduction of a team from Tasmania. The first time Tasmania competed in the inter-state tournament was 1 July 1952 against Victoria at the Hobart Glaciarium. Victoria would go on to win the Goodall Cup that year.\nThe Goodall Cup continued to be awarded to the winners of the inter-state ice hockey champions until 2001. In 2002 the Goodall Cup was used as an award to the playoff champions in the Australian Ice Hockey League, which is the most elite national ice hockey league in Australia. For its centenary, the Goodall Cup was used again as an award for an inter-state ice hockey competition but was returned to be used the AIHL immediately after.\n1922: The Gower Cup.\nThe first inter-state women's ice hockey championship tournament was held in the first week in August 1922 between New South Wales and Victoria, New South Wales won the first game of the series 3-0.\nThe first Women's ice hockey team representing New South Wales consisted of: \nBackground.\nThe New South Wales Ice Hockey Association (NSWIHA) was formed as the New South Wales state branch for Ice Hockey Australia. It is responsible for organising the nine state leagues across six different age groups during the normal season as well as a summer hockey league for senior players. It is also responsible for selecting the state teams to compete in the national tournaments.\nNSWIHA operates its leagues out of five venues – Macquarie Ice Rink, Sydney Ice Arena, Canterbury Olympic Ice Rink, Liverpool Catholic Club Ice Rink and the Penrith Ice Palace. Teams are fielded in the leagues by eight clubs – the Blacktown Flyers, Canberra Phoenix, Canterbury Eagles, East Coast Super League, Liverpool Saints, Newcastle Northstars, Norwest Emperors, Penrith Phantoms, and the Sydney Bears. The associations current president is Steve Ransome."

As a snooker player he was twice runner-up in the English Amateur Championship and reached the semi-final of the World Snooker Championship four times between 1948 and 1953.\nEarly life.\nBrown was born in Birmingham on 10 July 1911. He attended a boarding school from the age of seven, where he started playing English billiards on a three-quarter size billiard table and won the school championship for nine successive years. After leaving school, Brown's sporting focus was on cricket rather than cue sports, and he did not play billiards again until the age of 24, shortly after which a friend introduce him to snooker. A year after taking up snooker, Brown won the Midland Amateur Championship, defeating Kingsley Kennerley 4–0 in the final. He won the title again the following year, and after a hiatus in the championship being staged during World War II, completed a run of three wins. Before becoming a professional snooker player, he worked as a bus driver.\nCricket.\nBetween snooker seasons, Brown played cricket. A fast bowler, he was invited to play for Warwickshire after achieving hat tricks in consecutive weeks.\nBrown made a single first-class appearance for Warwickshire against the touring Indians at Edgbaston in 1932. The Indians made 282 all out in their first-innings, with Brown taking the wickets of Naoomal Jeoomal and Amar Singh to finish with figures of 2/61 from 22 overs. In Warwickshire's first-innings of 354 all out, Brown ended the innings not out on a single run. He bowled 14 wicketless overs in the Indians second-innings of 344 declared and wasn't required to bat in Warwickshire's second-innings of 110/3, with the match being declared a draw. This was his only major appearance for Warwickshire. He retired from cricket after failing to recover fully from a pulled muscle.\nSnooker.\nHe was runner-up in the English Amateur Championship in 1940, losing 7–8 to Kennerley. The next time the tournament was held, in 1946, Brown lost 3–5 to John Pulman in the final.

The statue was placed in October 1904 but was not officially unveiled until June 18, 1905 with a speech by Archbishop F. Symon from Rome. The statue was moved to its present location in 1951 and a celebratory unveiling was held on September 15 of that year.\nCondition.\nA condition assessment of the monument was conducted by McKay Lodge Conservation Laboratory. They found several condition issues some originating from the poor quality of the original cast and others due to climate. The condition problems included casting porosity, patches and plugs, chill cracks, weaknesses in armature, and a general need for cleaning. In 2013 the Restore Kosciuszko Monument Project successfully raised funds to fully restore the monument. The statue was rededicated on November 11, 2013."

It was the third and seventh time England and the United Kingdom hosted the Commonwealth Games, respectively.\n4,822 athletes, including 311 para athletes from 72 Commonwealth Games Associations took part in the event. The event took place at 15 venues across Birmingham, West Midlands and London and featured 19 Commonwealth sports. It was also the first major multi-sport event to have more events for women than men and had the largest integrated para-sport programme in the history of the Commonwealth Games with 8 para sports.\nAustralia topped the medal table by both total golds (67) and total medals (179), with host nation England finishing second with 58 golds and 176 total medals and Canada finishing third with 26 golds and 92 total medals. India finished fourth with 22 gold and 61 total medals, and New Zealand finished fifth with 20 gold and 49 total medals. Niue won its first ever Commonwealth Games medal.\nBirmingham was announced as the host city on 21 December 2017. The event marked the last time that the Commonwealth Games were held under Queen Elizabeth II prior to her death on 8 September of that year, which was exactly one month after the conclusion of the Games. The event contributed £1.2 billion to the economy of the United Kingdom.\nHost selection.\nTwo cities initially launched bids for the games; Durban, South Africa, and Edmonton, Canada. Edmonton withdrew its bid in February 2015, leaving Durban as the only bid to go forward to CGF General Assembly in September 2015. Durban initially secured the right to host the games, as they were the sole bidder for the event. The city previously considered bidding for the 2020 or 2024 Summer Olympics, but later dropped the idea as it wanted to focus on the 2022 Commonwealth Games. It would have marked the first time the games were held in Africa and the second time a Commonwealth republic would have hosted, following Delhi, India, in 2010. The games were set to open on 18 July 2022, coinciding with the birthday of the late South African president, Nelson Mandela. It was reported in February 2017 that Durban might be unable to host the games due to financial constraints. This was confirmed one month later on 13 March 2017 when the CGF stripped Durban of their rights to host the Games.\nThe bidding process for the 2022 Commonwealth Games was relaunched in March 2017 where English cities Birmingham and Liverpool expressed their interests in hosting the Games. On 14 March 2017, Manchester also expressed an interest in hosting the Games.By April 2017, the British Government asked city councils to submit proposals for hosting the 2022 Games. Only Birmingham and Liverpool submitted official applications to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. London declined to bid, as it was focusing its efforts on preparing for the World Athletics and Para Athletics Championships. On 27 April 2017, Manchester City Council announced that Manchester would not bid for the Games but could co-host the Games with other English cities. In early September 2017, Birmingham was selected over Liverpool for the recommended bid for England.\nThe CGF announced that the deadline for the submission of bids was 30 September 2017 and its executive board was expected to announce the host by the end of 2017. Commonwealth Games England submitted the Birmingham bid before the deadline to the CGF to host the 2022 Games. However, it was announced that the bid was not fully compliant, and the bidding process was extended until 30 November 2017. The CGF had 170 questions regarding Birmingham's bid. On 21 December 2017, Birmingham was awarded for the 2022 Games as Durban's replacement host. Louise Martin, president of the CGF, made the official announcement at a press conference at the Arena Academy in Birmingham.\nDevelopment and preparation.\nThe Birmingham Organising Committee for the 2022 Commonwealth Games (BOCCG) was responsible for the planning and operational delivery of the Games. This includes sport, venue and competition management, ticket sales, all ceremonies and the Queen's Baton Relay. The headquarters of the organising committee is located in One Brindleyplace building and has taken up the office until December 2022.\nIn March 2018, the BOCCG paid £25 million ($35 million) fee to the CGF for the right to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games. The fee included the £20 million ($28 million) for the Games hosting charges and £5 million ($7 million) for the development work in the Commonwealth.\nIn July 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May appointed John Crabtree as Chair of the BOCCG. In January 2019, Ian Reid was announced as chief executive officer of the BOCCG. On 6 June 2019, the British Government introduced the Commonwealth Games Bill which ensured the prohibition of unauthorised sales of Games tickets, effective flow of transport around Games venues, complete protection of commercial rights, and compliance with financial propriety rules by the government's funding of the BOCCG. The bill received royal assent and was passed into law as the Birmingham Commonwealth Games Act 2020 on 25 June 2020.\nIn June 2020, it was announced that the entire schedule of the Games would be offset by one day to reduce conflicts with sporting events rescheduled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the UEFA Euro 2020 (held on 11 June to 11 July 2021), the 2020 Summer Olympics (held on 23 July to 8 August 2021), the UEFA Women's Euro 2022 (held 6 to 31 July in England; the opening ceremony time would have conflicted with one of the semifinal matches), and the final days of the 2022 World Athletics Championships (held from 15 to 24 July). All athletes and officials are required to test negative for COVID-19 on a PCR test before departure and upon arrival; infections during the Games will be handled on a case-by-case basis, with athletes not necessarily required to withdraw or publicly disclose their infection. Commonwealth Games Australia considered the protocols to be less stringent and more \"relaxed\" than expected, and stated that it planned to impose stricter biosecurity protocols on its athletes to ensure their safety.\nVenues.\nThe 2022 Commonwealth Games took place in 15 venues spread across the West Midlands region, with seven of them, including the athletics stadium and marathon route, located in the city of Birmingham. The National Exhibition Centre complex, located on the fringes of the city in neighbouring Solihull, hosted events in its exhibition halls and at the Resorts World Arena. The six other regional hosts were Coventry, Cannock Chase, Royal Leamington Spa, Sandwell, Warwick and Wolverhampton. A sixteenth venue, the Lee Valley VeloPark in Stratford, East London, hosted the track cycling.\nThe following venues were used for the Games:\nAthletes' village.\nOn 11 August 2020, the BOCCG announced that the athletes and team officials will be housed in three ‘campus’ villages close to competition venues at the University of Birmingham, the University of Warwick, and the NEC Hotel Campus. Around 1,600 athletes and officials were set to be accommodated at the NEC Hotel Campus, 1,900 at the University of Warwick, and the principal village with 2,800 at the University of Birmingham.\nTransport.\nThe A34 flyover in Perry Barr was demolished in favour of a dual carriageway at ground level, cycle path and improved public transport services which were approved by Birmingham City Council in October 2019 under its £27.1 million scheme.\nThe city council announced in January 2020 that the existing National Express Bus Depot in Perry Barr would be demolished as the depot site would be used to construct the phase two of the athletes’ village. A replacement depot will be constructed on a largely council-owned land on nearby Aston Lane, at a cost of £16 million, eight times the original estimate.\nThe University railway station, which serves the University of Birmingham, was planned to be renovated and was expected to be complete in time for the Games. The station would make way for the University of Birmingham, which was due to host hockey and squash events for the Games. The new station was not finished in time for the event. The Perry Barr railway station building was rebuilt and the platforms renovated as part of the £30.9 million project in Perry Barr and opened on May 29, 2022.\nTransport for West Midlands (TfWM) was scheduled to provide the city's first continuous cross-city bus route in time for the Games. The new Sprint bus route was to run an express service along the A34 and A45 between Walsall and Birmingham Airport and Solihull to Walsall via the city centre. The service will be zero-emission with priority signals and extended bus lanes, along with \"a swift boarding experience\" to improve journey times and reliability. In February 2020 it was announced that the West Midlands Combined Authority Board was planning to approve the £88 million funding and delivery schedule for Sprint in advance of the Games, to offer commuters and the Games visitors services to key venues including Alexander Stadium, Arena Birmingham and the Resorts World Arena. As of November 2023, the service has yet to commence running.\nCost and financing.\nAt the time of submission of the bid to the CGF, the bid committee announced that the event would cost £750 million. On 25 June 2019, the British Government announced that the event will cost £778 million. The British Government will cover 75% (£594 million) and Birmingham City Council will cover the remaining 25% (£184 million). The budget is lower than the £967 million spent on the Gold Coast 2018, but higher than the £543 million spent on the Glasgow 2014. It is set to be the most expensive sporting event in the UK since the 2012 Summer Olympics in London which cost £8.8 billion. The real cost will be published after completion.\nTicketing.\nOver 1.3 million tickets were sold for the 2022 Commonwealth Games, which made the event the most attended Commonwealth Games ever to take place in the United Kingdom. A ticket ballot for local residents opened on 14 July 2021, with the main public ticket ballot running from 8 to 30 September 2021.\nSecurity.\nThe West Midlands Police said around 3,000 officers would be deployed to patrol the 2022 Commonwealth Games. 1,000 of these were to come from West Midlands Police and 2000 from a \"mutual aid\" arrangement with other UK forces. Additionally, private drones were banned over a no-fly zone and 55 police dogs were also part of the security plan.\nFestival.\nThe 2022 Commonwealth Games was accompanied by a six-month long cultural event called the Birmingham 2022 Festival. It had been billed as \"the biggest celebration of creativity ever seen in the region\" and was taking place in the host city and throughout the West Midlands. With more than 200 events planned, it was one of the biggest cultural programmes ever hosted during the Commonwealth Games. Events took place before and after the 2022 Games, which took place between July 28 and August 8, 2022, from March to September 2022.\nQueen's baton relay.\nThe Queen's baton of the 2022 Commonwealth Games was unveiled 29 September 2021. Designed as a collaboration between Birmingham Open Media, Raymont-Osman Product Design, Maokwo and Kajul, it is constructed using lost-wax casting, 3D Printing, copper plating and CNC machining. It incorporates copper, aluminum, and brass metals symbolising medals, and a strip of platinum in observance of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. It also contains a 360-degree camera, an LED lighting system tied to a heart rate monitor (and displaying different effects when held by two people), and sensors to record environmental conditions—whose data will be analysed by a team at the University of Birmingham following the relay.\nLaura Nyahuye, who led the team of five artists at Maokwo, stated that the baton was designed to \"relate\" to the countries and residents of the Commonwealth, and reflect the \"authenticity and honesty\" of its journey; these goals were met by avoiding the use of precious metals, and through its use of copper—which is designed to oxidise and develop a teal patina over the course of the relay.\nThe relay began on 7 October 2021 at Buckingham Palace in London, and lasted for 294 days—travelling through 72 Commonwealth nations and territories. After placing her message inside the baton, Queen Elizabeth II presented it to British Paralympic athlete and cyclist Kadeena Cox. During the opening ceremony, the baton was delivered to Charles, Prince of Wales, who read the Queen's message to officially open the Games.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony of the 2022 Commonwealth Games were held at Alexander Stadium on 28 July 2022. Director Iqbal Khan stated that the ceremony would aim to showcase the \"vivid and vibrant confidence\" of Birmingham. It was headlined by Birmingham-based new wave band Duran Duran, while Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath–who is also a Birmingham native–performed alongside Soweto Kinch during a segment of the ceremony.\nClosing ceremony.\nThe closing ceremony took place on 8 August 2022 at Alexander Stadium, and included the formal handover to the Australian state of Victoria, then host of the 2026 Commonwealth Games prior to its withdrawal nearly a year later, in a segment headlined by Vanessa Amorosi. The ceremony featured tributes to the industrial history of Birmingham, the Windrush generation and Birmingham TV show \"Peaky Blinders\", and included performances from a number of famous West Midlands musicians and groups, including Dexys Midnight Runners, UB40, Panjabi MC, Musical Youth, Goldie, Beverley Knight, Apache Indian, Jorja Smith, The Selecter, and Laura Mvula. The grand finale featured a surprise appearance by Ozzy Osbourne in his first live performance in three years, joined by Tony Iommi and former touring members of Black Sabbath Tommy Clufetos and Adam Wakeman for a medley of \"Iron Man\" and \"Paranoid\".\nParticipating associations.\nAll 72 Commonwealth Games Associations sent athletes to the 2022 Commonwealth Games.\nThe number of athletes from each association is:\nSports.\nCommonwealth Games Charter.\nA new edition of the Commonwealth Games Charter came into effect for these Games. In addition to the ten core sports that were part of Gold Coast 2018 – athletics, badminton, boxing, hockey, lawn bowls, netball (for women), rugby sevens, squash, swimming and weightlifting – five new sports will be integrated into the core sports: road cycling, judo (previously optional), triathlon, table tennis, and wrestling. The charter also mandates that a number of parasports events (i.e. sports for elite athletes with disabilities) must be integrated within four core sports: athletics, lawn bowls, swimming and weightlifting (the lattermost is actually represented by a variation of powerlifting).\nThe charter also establishes the list of optional sports and disciplines that can be chosen by the organisation of each edition: archery (recurve), basketball (3x3 or 5x5), beach volleyball, cycling (mountain bike and track), rhythmic gymnastics, and shooting (clay target, full bore, small bore and pistol). This same rule also establishes that the following events for athletes with disabilities are optional: wheelchair basketball (3x3), para track-cycling, para-table tennis and para-triathlon. Including compulsory and optional sports (disciplines), there shall be no more than 4 team sports on the programme of a Commonwealth Games. If basketball (3x3) is selected from the pool of optional sports, basketball (wheelchair para 3x3) becomes an obligatory event (or vice versa), in which case the sport of basketball shall be considered as one team sport. In cases when cricket is selected from the pool of optional sports, wheelchair basketball also becomes a part of the programme and can be an exception to the 4 team sports limit. Respecting local demands, an extra sport or some extra events can be included in this list, but they have to be approved by the Commonwealth Games Federation two years before that edition is held. The current rules also determine gender parity, whereby men and women have an equal (or broadly equal) share of events.\nInput to list of disciplines.\nOn 22 December 2017, the BBC reported that the organisers of the games were in talks with the International Cricket Council (ICC) about the inclusion of women's cricket. In November 2018, the ICC confirmed that they have submitted a bid to include women's cricket in the Games. The bid was made in partnership with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).\nIt was also reported that shooting was likely to be excluded from the games citing a lack of facilities around Birmingham. Shooting has been included at every Commonwealth Games since Christchurch 1974. In January 2018, the dropping of shooting from the games programme was confirmed by the then CEO of the CGF David Grevemberg. In December 2018, The International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) delegation including President of ISSF Vladimir Lisin and CEO of British Shooting (BS) Hamish McInnes visited Birmingham and discussed with the Birmingham organising committee to add shooting in the 2022 Commonwealth Games.\nIn December 2018, the World Archery Federation (WA) confirmed that they had delivered a proposal for archery's inclusion in the Games. The bid was made in partnership with Archery GB and included Aston Hall as a suggested competition venue.\nIn June 2019, after some time of popular searches and queries. Birmingham organising committee recommended the addition of two extra sports: para table tennis and beach volleyball. The proposal was approved by the CGF executive board.\nThe CGF officially announced on 13 August 2019 that the women's T20 cricket, beach volleyball and para table tennis have been included in the Games while due to infrastructure and logistics issues shooting had to be excluded and the proposal to add archery was rejected.\nBirmingham 2022 list of disciplines.\nWith the changes in the Charter, and the review of options, the major changes from Gold Coast 2018 include the addition of judo to the core sports and the local organizers' optional decision to hold a women's cricket tournament, taking advantage of local infrastructure. Returning to the Games for the first time in 24 years, due to various calendar issues, cricket will be exclusively female for the first time.\nFirst time events introduced at Birmingham 2022 are 3x3 basketball and its wheelchair counterpart. Birmingham will have the largest number of events available for women and athletes with disabilities in the history of the Games.\nIn October 2020, the list of events to be played in Birmingham was revealed, though three parasport relays in athletics and swimming were later removed from the programme owing to a lack of indicative entries. The schedule was refined to 280 finals played across 20 disciplines. This includes 136 events for women and 134 for men, an unprecedented gender balance amongst major multi-sport events though falling short of the 2018 Commonwealth Games when a perfect gender split had been achieved. In addition, 10 mixed gender events and 39 parasport events were scheduled.\nThe final list of disciplines, with the number of events in each discipline noted in the brackets, is:\nAssociated competitions.\nIn January 2020, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), which functions also as the Commonwealth Games Association (CGA) representing India, submitted a proposal to the CGF to host a combined archery and shooting championships in Chandigarh during January 2022. The proposal was endorsed by the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI), the Government of India, the ISSF and WA. The CGF Executive Board approved the proposal at their meeting in London which took place on 21–23 February 2020, and also confirmed that the 2022 Commonwealth Shooting and Archery Championships and the 2022 Commonwealth Games will be two separately organised and funded Commonwealth Sport events. The CGF shall issue a medal table one week following the Birmingham 2022 closing ceremony that includes results from Chandigarh 2022 as a further and final ranking of competing nations and territories from the respective competitions. In July 2021, the CGF announced that the event had been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in India.\nIn February 2022, the CGF announced that esports would be included in the Games as a demonstration event and is in a possibility to be added at the games program at the future editions. The inaugural Commonwealth Esports Championship will have separate branding, medals, and organisation and will include both men and women's \"Dota 2\", \"eFootball\", and \"Rocket League\" events.\nMedal table.\nOn 14 July 2023, the Nigerian team was disqualified as winners of the women's 4x100 metre relay in athletics as Nzubechi Grace Nwokocha was found in violation of anti-doping measures. This promoted England to gold, Jamaica to silver, and Australia were awarded bronze.\nPodium sweeps.\nThe podium sweeps, in which a single CGA won all the available medals in an event, were:\nMarketing.\nEmblem.\nThe official emblem was unveiled on 27 July 2019 at Centenary Square during the Commonwealth Social festival. It was designed by local agency RBL, based in Royal Leamington Spa, and is a jagged, triangular \"B\" shape formed by blue-yellow gradient lines representing the key venues of the Games in the West Midlands. The emblem is also the first to use the new branding for the CGF, as \"Commonwealth Sport\". It received a mainly positive reaction from locals in the city and on social media and some compared it to the emblem for the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics.\nSponsors.\nThe official sponsors of the 2022 Commonwealth Games were Longines, University of Birmingham, E.ON, Chase, Severn Trent and Dettol.\nMascot.\nThe official mascot for the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games is Perry, a multi-coloured bull. Perry is named after an area of Birmingham, Perry Barr, within which Perry Park and the main athletics stadium, the Alexander Stadium, are located. The bull has a long history with being a symbol of Birmingham, and was positively received by the public on launch. Perry was designed by ten-year-old Emma Lou from Bolton. Perry was reproduced in coloured willow in a Birmingham 2022 display commemorating the games at the Chelsea Flower Show in 2022.\nBroadcasting.\nIn July 2020, production company Sunset+Vine was appointed as the host broadcaster for the event. In October 2020, BBC acquired the United Kingdom rights. A record 57.1 million streams were generated on the BBC digital platforms by coverage of the 2022 Commonwealth Games, breaking the previous Commonwealth Games record. Additionally, the number of streams from the previous Commonwealth Games was more than six times higher than it was with this figure. The last event in 2018 took place in Australia, which is in a completely different time zone. 28.6 million people watched 2022 Commonwealth Games on the BBC's linear channels in total. Prior to the women's 100-metre backstroke and men's 100-metre breaststroke finals, viewership peaked at 6.6 million viewers, while the opening ceremony attracted a five-minute audience peak of 5.2 million. Audiences peaked at 5.1 million for the women's 4 x 400-metre relay final, while 4.8 million watched the closing ceremony. Other notable moments of the BBC's coverage included 4.2 million people watching the men's 200-metre final and 4.1 million people watching Adam Peaty win the 50-metre breaststroke final."

        "title": "Adam Henry (American football)",
        "text": "Adam Henry (born April 27, 1972) is an American football coach and former player who is the wide receivers coach for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL). Henry has previously served as wide receivers coach for the Indiana Hoosiers, LSU, San Francisco 49ers, Cleveland Browns, and New York Giants. He also served as tight ends coach for the Oakland Raiders. He has coached Pro Bowlers Odell Beckham Jr., Anquan Boldin, Amari Cooper, CeeDee Lamb, Jarvis Landry, and Zach Miller.\nCollege career.\nHenry was a wide receiver at McNeese State from 1990 to 1993, earning All-Southland Conference honors as a senior. He finished his career with 93 receptions for 1,690 yards and 16 touchdowns, all of which remain in the top-10 in school history. He was enshrined in the McNeese Sports Hall of Fame in 2017.\nProfessional career.\nFollowing his career at McNeese State, Henry signed a free agent contract with the New Orleans Saints in 1994. He spent training camp and the preseason with the Saints in 1995 and 1996. In a 1995 preseason game, he caught a 26 yard TD pass from Tommy Hodson against the Seahawks.\nCoaching career.\nMcNeese State.\nHenry joined McNeese State in 1997 as the wide receivers coach. He served as wide receivers coach for nine seasons before being promoted to assistant head coach and offensive coordinator in 2006. As the wide receivers coach, Henry helped develop Jermaine Martin, who finished his career as the school's all-time leader in receptions (160) and receiving yards (2,646), as well as the 2003 Southland Conference Player of the Year, B.J. Sams. During his time with McNeese, the Cowboys won 4 Southland Conference Championships and went to their only two Division I-AA Championship games, losing both including a 4th quarter loss to Youngstown State late in the 4th quarter.\nOakland Raiders.\nHenry would join the Oakland Raiders in 2007. He spent his first two years with the Raiders as an offensive quality control assistant. Henry was promoted to tight ends coach by head coach Tom Cable in 2009. Henry helped accelerate the development of Zach Miller, who became the first tight end in franchise history to lead the team in receiving for three straight years. Miller set career highs in receptions (66) and receiving yards (805) in 2009, and was selected to the Pro Bowl for the first time the following season, in 2010. In 2011, Henry was retained by new head coach Hue Jackson. However, he was not retained following Jackson's dismissal as head coach.\nLSU.\nHenry would join the LSU Tigers football team in 2012. In his first year with the Tigers, Henry's receiving unit featured four underclassmen and was led by sophomores Odell Beckham Jr. and Jarvis Landry, who combined for 99 receptions for 1,286 yards and seven touchdowns. In 2013, Beckham and Landry became the first pair of receivers in school history to finish with more than 1,000 yards in the same season. Landry led the Tigers with 77 receptions for 1,193 yards and 10 touchdowns, while Beckham caught 59 passes for 1,152 yards and eight touchdowns. Beckham earned first-team All-America honors as a kick returner and an all-purpose player in 2013, and was the recipient of the 2013 Hornung Award as college football's most versatile player. In 2014, redshirt sophomore Travin Dural finished the season ranked sixth in the SEC in receiving yards (758) and tied for seventh in receiving touchdowns (seven). Dural's 20.5 yards per reception average was best in the conference among players with at least 35 catches.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nHenry joined the San Francisco 49ers as the wide receivers coach in 2015.\nNew York Giants.\nIn the wake of an end of the season meltdown by Beckham, the New York Giants hired Henry to join the team as the wide receivers coach in 2016 where he was reunited with Beckham. That season Henry coached in his first playoff game, a 38-13 loss to the Packers in the wild-card round. Also, Beckham made a career-high 101 catches for 1,367 yards and 10 TDs, second in Giants history, and his yardage was third. Sterling Shepard, meanwhile, was second among NFL rookies with 65 catches.\nCleveland Browns.\nHenry signed a 3-year deal with the Cleveland Browns as their new wide receivers coach in 2018, reuniting him with Jarvis Landry and, the next season, with Odell Beckham Jr. In 2019 Landry and Beckham became the first wideouts in Browns history to each record over 1,000 receiving yards in the same season.\nDallas Cowboys.\nHenry left the Browns to join the Dallas Cowboys as their new wide receivers coach. The move came soon after the Cowboys hired former Green Bay Packers head coach, Mike McCarthy. In 2020, the Cowboys finished first in the NFC in receptions and CeeDee Lamb set a rookie record for catches and Cooper became just the 4th Cowboy to get 90 receptions in a season. In 2021 he coached CeeDee Lamb, who had over 1,000 yards receiving and Henry coached in his second playoff game, a 23-17 loss to the 49ers in the Wild Card round.\nIndiana Hoosiers.\nOn March 18, 2022 Tom Allen hired Henry as the Hoosiers' co-offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach.\nBuffalo Bills.\nOn February 15, 2023, Henry left Indiana to be the Buffalo Bills wide receivers coach, taking over for Chad Hall, who left for the same position with the Jacksonville Jaguars. The move was thought to once again reunite him with Beckham whom the Bills were trying to sign. In 2023, Henry coached for his first division champion as the Bills won the AFC East; and coached in his first playoff victory as the Bills beat Pittsburgh in the Wild Card Round. The next week they were upset by the Kansas City Chiefs 27-24 in the Divisional Playoffs.\nPersonal life.\nHenry is a native of Beaumont, Texas, He has three children, Darian, Kynidee, and Ava. Henry is a member of Epsilon Phi chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi. Henry is married to Dr. Zita Henry (Fayetteville, NC)."

In 2017, Snooker Legends promoted and held its first professional event the 2017 World Seniors Championship. Later in 2017 they created the World Seniors Tour for players aged 40 and above.

The teams were England and Northern Ireland vs The Rest of the World, with Dennis Taylor and Cliff Thorburn as respective captains. The Rest of the World won 18–14.\nOther events in the same year included the additions of Mark Williams and Joe Johnson to the tour. The format was changed to include doubles matches as well as the single matches, and also involved a colour clearance time challenge in which two teams of doubles cleared only the colours as quickly as they could alternating shots. The exhibitions also gave members of the audience a chance to play a doubles match with the professional players.\n2014.\nThe tour started off with visits to Guildford where Chelsea Footballer John Terry played and also Southend, Watford and Durham. In April the legends went back to the crucible with the addition of Joe Johnson and Tony Knowles and then in May moved onto Ipswich and Hamm in Germany.

It was the 36th such Ironman Triathlon World Championship, which has been held annually in Hawaii since 1978, with an additional race in 1982. The championship is organized by the World Triathlon Corporation (WTC).\nQualification.\nFor entry into the 2012 World Championship race, amateur athletes were required to qualify through a performance at an Ironman or selected Ironman 70.3 race. Entry into the championship race could also be obtained through a random allocation lottery or through the Ironman’s charitable eBay auction. The division of athletes was divided into professional, age group, physically challenged, and hand cycle divisions. \nFor professional triathletes, the 2012 championship season marked the second year of a point system that determined which professional triathletes would qualify for the championship race. To qualify, points were earned by competing in WTC sanctioned Ironman and Ironman 70.3 events throughout the qualifying year. For the 2012 championship race that period was September 1, 2011 to August 31, 2012. The top 50 male and top 30 female pros in points at the end of the qualifying year qualified to race in Kona. An athlete's five highest scoring races were counted in the point totals. At least one Ironman race must have been completed and only three Ironman 70.3 races could count towards an athlete's overall point total. Prior champions receive an automatic entry for the Championship race for a period of five years after their last championship performance provided that they competed in at least one full-distance Ironman race during the qualifying year. Their entry does not count toward the number of available qualifying spots.\nThe Ironman 2012 series consisted of 28 Ironman races plus the 2011 Ironman World Championship which was itself a qualifier for the 2012 Championship."

Boasting a large social membership section, the club also has teams playing a variety of other sports including cribbage, darts, dominoes, five-a-side football and netball.\nThe club was the first multi-sports club in the UK to achieve Clubmark or equivalent accreditation's in all its official sporting sections. Then in 2010, the club underwent a major redevelopment which included the addition of a new changing facility, the refurbishment of the existing clubhouse and new floodlit tennis courts. As a result, PCTBC was then chosen as the showcase club for the inaugural NatWest ECB CricketForce Fundraiser weekend.\nHistory.\nLocations.\nFounded in 1840, the club ranks amongst the oldest in the Manchester area and had its first ground at Thatch Leach Lane in Whitefield. In 1850 the club moved the short distance to Diggle Hills until 1862 when Manchester Corporation acquired the cricket pitch so that a new reservoir could be built. Next in the order was Stack Meadow (where Highfield Road is now located) which was to remain the club's home until notice was served to leave the ground in 1903. A year later, Prestwich Cricket and Tennis Club as it was then called, moved to its current location at Heys Road.\nSections.\nThe club started as solely a cricket club up until tennis was introduced in 1891 (competitive fixtures commencing in 1893). Crown green bowls was included in 1914 with the most recent addition of an official sporting section being that of football in 2009.\nPrestwich Cricket Club.\nResponsible for over 170 years of cricket in the town, Prestwich has played in numerous leagues and competitions right up to the formation of the Lancashire County League after the demise of the Lancashire and Cheshire League in 1994. The last decade has brought the club's most successful period in their entire history with three First Division Championship titles, three Walkden cups, three Division Two Championships, six Hulme Trophy cups and four T. Saville Whittle successes. This haul included an unprecedented Lancashire County League 'quadruple' in 2007 where the first and second teams both won their league and cup competitions. The current first team, captained by Steven Lorenzini, are reigning First Division champions.\nThe club also has a third team competing in the North Manchester Cricket League as well as a thriving junior section playing competitive cricket at a number of age groups.\nPrestwich Tennis Club.\nWith six floodlit all-weather tennis courts, Prestwich Tennis club attracts players of all ages all year round for competitive and social tennis. Summer and winter leagues and competitions cater for both doubles and singles players while the club's resident LTA coach hosts numerous events and training camps for both junior members and children from around the local area.\nThe tennis section was also the first traditional tennis club to achieve their Clubmark accreditation.\nPrestwich Bowling Club.\nA popular destination around the local leagues, Prestwich Bowling Club members compete in numerous senior and veteran competitions throughout the summer months. Also well received are the various annual social events and tournaments held at the club. The Bowling section achieved its Clubmark accreditation in 2010 from Greater Sport.\nPrestwich Football Club.\nWhile a number of teams have played under the club's banner over the years, the current football section was started in 2005 by Alan Michaelovitz and Peter Lorenzini under the name Prestwich CC Football Club playing in the Bury &amp; District Sunday League. In 2009, the club dropped the 'CC' from its name and expanded to include open age Saturday teams in the Lancashire Amateur League and as well as junior teams competing in numerous local leagues. The club gained Charter Standard status through the Lancashire FA in January 2010. As of the 2011/12 season, the First Team play in the Premier Division, the Reserve Team in Division Four and the A Team in Division Five. The Sunday Team are in their respective Premier Division also."

        "text": "The 2012 Auto GP World Series was the third year of the Auto GP series, and the fourteenth season of the former Euroseries 3000. The championship began on 11 March at Monza in Italy and finished on 23 September at Sonoma in the United States, after seven double-header rounds.\nEach meeting's sprint race now lasts for a longer duration – a minimum of , up from  – while also introducing a mandatory pit-stop to the race. The series also introduced an overboost system that has already been used in the FIA Formula Two Championship. The points system for the second race was also amended.\nAdrian Quaife-Hobbs won the opening race of the season at Monza after qualifying on pole position by 0.04 seconds. Pål Varhaug finished in second place and returnee Daniël de Jong attained his maiden podium in third. The reverse-grid second race was won by Varhaug, who left the meeting tied for the championship lead with Quaife-Hobbs. Three weeks later at Valencia, Quaife-Hobbs claimed pole again, but was unable to convert pole into another win, losing to Sergey Sirotkin, who became the youngest Auto GP winner, while Varhaug completed the podium. Quaife-Hobbs and Sirotkin continued their battle into the sprint race until an error during Sirotkin's pit-stop ended the battle early. Sirotkin recovered to finish the race in third place behind Quaife-Hobbs – who extended his championship lead with the race win – and Facu Regalia, who scored his first podium.\nTwo weeks later, the series' first non-European round was held in Morocco, where Sirotkin claimed his first pole position. He made a poor getaway, after being distracted by a marshal at the start. he lost many positions with Varhaug taking the lead. Varhaug was chased by Italian Formula Three champion Sergio Campana, leading until the pit-stop phase. Varhaug stalled in pit lane, losing positions to both Campana and Quaife-Hobbs, with Campana eventually taking his first series win, and the first for Team MLR71, after a close battle with Quaife-Hobbs. Sirotkin took the lead at the start of the second race, but lost time after his pit-stop, allowing Manor MP Motorsport's Chris van der Drift through to take his first win in the series ahead of Sirotkin. Varhaug, Quaife-Hobbs and Giacomo Ricci battled over the final podium position with Varhaug taking the position on-the-road before receiving a 25-second time penalty post-race for cutting a chicane. Ricci was promoted into third place ahead of Quaife-Hobbs, while Varhaug dropped to seventh and lost ground in the championship, falling behind Sirotkin, who moved into second.\nRace calendar and results.\nA seven-round calendar was published on 23 December 2011, with all rounds supporting World Touring Car Championship events. On 9 March 2012, it was announced that the Portuguese round moved from Estoril to Portimão.\nChampionship standings.\nIn addition:"

        "text": "This is a list of all own goals scored during FIFA Men's World Cup matches (not including qualification games). In 1997, FIFA published guidelines for classifying an own goal as \"when a player plays the ball directly into his own net or when he redirects an opponent’s shot, cross or pass into his own goal\", and excludes \"shots that are on target (i.e. goal-bound) and touch a defender or rebound from the goal frame and bounce off a defender or goalkeeper\".\nOf the 2,720 goals scored at the 22 final tournaments of the World Cup, only 54 have been own goals. No player has scored multiple own goals. Mexico's players have scored own goals on four occasions each, while France has benefited on six occasions from opponents scoring own goals. Of the 53 matches with an own goal, nine have ended as wins for the team scoring the own goal, and eight have ended as draws. All but 13 own goals have been scored in the first stages of the tournament.\nFollowing the 1994 murder of Colombian Andrés Escobar by a fan who was angry that Escobar's own goal had led to their country's early exit from that year's World Cup, own goals at the tournament have been subject to intense scrutiny, to stave off accusations of collusion. The 2018 World Cup, dubbed by \"The Washington Post\" as \"among the cruelest in history\" based on own goals mid-way through the group stages, ended up doubling the previous record for number of own goals at a single tournament."

        "title": "2012–13 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2012–13 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team represented the University of Michigan during the 2012–13 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team played its home games in Ann Arbor, Michigan, at the Crisler Center. This season marked the team's 96th consecutive year as a member of the Big Ten Conference, and it is occasionally referred to as \"Team 96\". The team was led by sixth-year head coach John Beilein. As the defending 2011–12 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season regular season co-champions, the Wolverines finished fourth in the conference in 2012–13 and as National Runner-up in the 2013 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament after losing in the championship game to Louisville. Louisville's win was later vacated due to the 2015 University of Louisville basketball sex scandal. The team achieved a 31–8 record, the most wins by the program in 20 seasons.\nFollowing the 2011–12 season, the team lost graduating senior captains Zack Novak and Stu Douglass, who moved on to professional basketball careers in Europe. The incoming class of Mitch McGary, Glenn Robinson III and Nik Stauskas was ranked among the best classes in the nation by the media. With its new lineup, the team matched the greatest starts in school history. Starting the season with 11 consecutive wins matched the best start since Michigan's 1989 national champions, the 1988–89 team. At 16–0, Michigan matched its best start since the last repeat Big Ten Regular season championship, the 1985–86 team, tying a school record. Reaching 19–1 set a record for the best start in school history. The team also reached the number one position in the AP Poll for the first time since the Fab Five 1992–93 team. The team entered February with a 20–1 record (7–1 Big Ten), but with an injury to eventual B1G All-Defensive selection Jordan Morgan and a stretch of games against its strongest conference opponents, Michigan lost three out of four games. The team closed the season with a 5–5 run to finish tied for fourth in the conference and won one game in the Big Ten tournament before being eliminated.\nThe team was led by 2013 national player of the year, Big Ten Player of the Year and 2013 Consensus All-American Trey Burke and three additional All-Conference honorees. Tim Hardaway Jr. was named to the 2012–13 All-Big Ten first team by the coaches and to the second team by the media; Robinson was named an honorable mention All-Big Ten by the media, and Morgan was an All-Big Ten Defensive team selection. Stauskas and McGary earned multiple Big Ten Freshman of the Week recognitions during the season. Burke was the second National Player of the Year and eighth first-team consensus All-American in Michigan basketball history.\nMichigan entered the 2013 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as the youngest team in the field. The team made its first Sweet Sixteen appearance since the 1993–94 team did so. The Wolverines made their first \"official\" appearance in the Final Four and the national title game since the 1989 national championship season; appearances in 1992 and 1993 were vacated due to a scandal. Following the season, at the 2013 NBA draft, Burke and Hardaway were selected ninth and twenty-fourth, respectively, becoming the first pair of first-round NBA draft choices from Michigan since the 1994 NBA draft.\nPreseason roster changes.\nDepartures.\nThe team lost both of its captains from the prior season to graduation after they completed their eligibility. Senior two-time captain Douglass turned pro, joining Basket Navarra Club of the Liga Española de Baloncesto. Senior three-time captain Novak graduated to play for Landstede Basketbal in the Dutch Basketball League. In addition to the loss of senior co-captains, the team lost three players who decided to transfer: Evan Smotrycz, Carlton Brundidge and Colton Christian. Smotrycz, who transferred to Maryland, had started in 42 of the 69 games he played during his first two years. He left the program as the fifth-best all-time three-point shooter with a percentage of 40.5. Brundidge transferred to Detroit and Christian transferred to Florida International. The program also announced the departure of walk-on Sai Tummala and the return of walk-on Corey Person for a fifth year.\n2012–13 team recruits.\nGlenn Robinson III, son of former first overall NBA draft pick Glenn Robinson, verbally committed on September 14, 2010, as the first commitment in Michigan's class of 2012. On March 26, 2011, Michigan received its second verbal commitment of the class of 2012 from Canadian wing guard Nik Stauskas. On November 3, Mitch McGary, who was ranked as the number two prospect in the nation at the time, announced his verbal commitment to Michigan. Within hours of the commitment, ESPN announced that Michigan ranked as the fifth best class in the nation. Each of the three signed a National Letter of Intent with the team on November 9. After several other schools announced their commitments, the signing of McGary moved Michigan from outside the top 25 at the end of October to the number 7 class in the nation by mid-November, according to ESPN. That November, McGary, Robinson and Stauskas ranked 3, 34, and 79, respectively, in the Rivals.com Class of 2012 Top 150.\nAll three recruits had playoff success: McGary was a member of Brewster Academy's National Prep Championship team. Stauskas earned the championship game MVP of the NEPSAC Class AA Championship after leading St. Mark's to victory. Robinson led Lake Central to its first Indiana High School Athletic Association sectional title in 15 years. He earned the \"Post-Tribune\" Boys basketball player of the year award for Northwest Indiana and the state MVP from the \"Indiana Basketball News\".\nMcGary was invited to participate in the four-team April 1, 2012 All-American Championship, along with future teammate Robinson in New Orleans. Robinson was awarded the ESPNHS All-American Championship Player of the Game for his 16-point, 4-rebound performance, which included 5 dunks among his 6-for-7 shooting night. McGary was also selected to represent USA Basketball at the fifteenth annual Nike Hoops Summit on April 7 as part of the 2012 USA Junior National Select Team.\nMichael \"Spike\" Albrecht committed to Michigan on April 6, 2012. Albrecht led Northfield Mount Hermon School to the 2012 NEPSAC Class AAA Boys' Basketball Tournament, defeating McGary's Brewster Academy in the semifinals. Albrecht was MVP of the tournament. Albrecht was a former AAU teammate of McGary and Robinson. Albrecht's and outgoing captain Novak's fathers were collegiate teammates. Albrecht was a 2011 graduate of Crown Point High School. After most of the big signings announced their decisions on the April 11 signing day, Michigan was ranked as the early number 5 preseason selection as a team by ESPN.\n2013–14 team recruits.\nZak Irvin was named 2013 Indiana Mr. Basketball, giving Hamilton Southeastern High School the state's first back-to-back winners (Gary Harris) from the same high school. Derrick Walton was runner up in the 2013 Mr. Basketball of Michigan by a 2130–2086 margin to Iowa State signee Monte Morris despite having one more first place vote. Both Walton and Irvin were 2013 Parade All-American honorees and were named state Boys Basketball Gatorade Player of the Year.\nPreseason.\nMichigan basketball hosted its on campus media day press conference on October 10, 2012, at Crisler Center. The team was represented by Burke, Hardaway, Morgan and Beilein at the Big Ten Conference Basketball Media Day press conference on October 24 in Rosemont, Illinois. When the 24-person Big Ten Media poll was announced, Michigan was predicted to finish second to Indiana. Burke was a preseason All-Conference selection by the same media.\nMichigan enjoyed high expectations from the national media as well during the preseason. \"Sporting News\" named them to the number 5 position in its preseason poll, while conference foes Indiana and Ohio State were ranked number 1 and 3, respectively. Michigan also earned the number 5 ranking in both the preseason Coaches' Poll and preseason Associated Press poll, but behind Indiana (#1) and Ohio State (#4) in both. This was Michigan's highest preseason ranking since the 1992–93 team. \"Sports Illustrated\" ranked Michigan number 9 in its October preseason power rankings, again behind Indiana (#1) and Ohio State (#6), but when it printed its November preseason poll listed Michigan at number 6 ahead of Ohio State (#7), but behind Indiana (#1). Prior to the first exhibition game on November 1, senior Josh Bartelstein was named team captain.\nESPN's Eamonn Brennan noted that Michigan was a perimeter oriented team with possibly the best one-two guard combination in the country. Burke and Hardaway were both preseason John R. Wooden Award top 50 selections. Burke was a preseason All-American (Associated Press first team, CBS Sports second team, \"Sports Illustrated\" second team, ESPN second team, \"Sporting News\" third team) as well as a preseason Naismith Award top 50 selection.\nSlogans, nicknames and emblems.\nWE ON.\nThe acronym \"WE ON\" was the slogan for the whole team for the 2012–13 season. The team and coaching staff selected it at the beginning of the season as another way for Michigan to say Bo Schembechler's famous quote, \"the Team, the Team, the Team.\" The acronym \"WE ON\" stands for \"When Everyone Operates N'sync.\" Michigan assistant coach Bacari Alexander even tweeted that the acronym summarizes this team-focused mindset. According to Dave Brandon, assistant coach LaVall Jordan and director of basketball operations Travis Conlan guided the team to develop the slogan.\nAdidas warm up shirts were created and were first worn on November 21, 2012, before Michigan's NIT Season Tip-Off game against the Pittsburgh Panthers. The shirts use the school colors with blue with maize lettering. On February 12, 2013, when Michigan played the first of two regularly scheduled rivalry games against Michigan State, students in the Izzone at the Breslin Center wore T-shirts with \"YOU OFF\" printed in Spartan colors (green and white). Michigan State went on to win the game by 23 points.\n\"WE\" – WE is also an acronym for \"Wolverine Excellence\", which is chiefly used by the team. Wolverine Excellence calls for players and managers to focus on its five core values: integrity, unity, passion, diligence and appreciation.\n\"ON\" – ON represented each player's individual commitment to season-long improvement. There was a \"U-M Fuse Box\" (mock-University of Michigan set of switches) in the Men's Basketball locker room in Crisler Center. Each player had selected one word on which to focus during the season and before every practice and game, each player flipped his switch \"on.\" This represented each player's commitment to improvement every day.\nFresh Five.\nPrior to the season, the five freshmen were dubbed the \"Fresh Five\", a moniker hearkening remembrance of the incoming freshman class of 1991, known as the Fab Five, that led Michigan to back-to-back Championship games while starting the majority of games. However, the nickname and its expectations were downplayed most of the season by the team. Nonetheless, during the final two weeks of the regular season \"The New York Times\" ran a feature story on the team that reinvigorated the nickname while noting that the current five were the supporting cast rather than the stars of the team like the original five.\nCanadian flag.\nESPN's Chantel Jennings tweeted a picture of a Flag of Canada redone in Michigan's team colors of maize and blue at Crisler Arena on December 4. One of her followers noted that the big version on the wall was a general Stauskas fan flag and that a little version of the flag was added next to it for each three-pointer Canadian Stauskas made in the game. By mid-December of his freshman season, the students in the Maize Rage (Michigan student section at Crisler Arena) had begun cheering Stauskas on with such a flag. The Michigan Public &amp; Media Relations office started mentioning the flag before Christmas. The flag was mentioned widely in the press as he continued his hot shooting into January.\n Through the first week of January, Stauskas was shooting 53.7% on three-point shots as the team held a 15–0 record.\n96.\nThe team, which represented Michigan Basketball for the ninety-sixth season in the Big Ten Conference, is sometimes referred to as Team 96 or Squad 96. Although this team represented Michigan for the ninety-sixth consecutive year, there was controversy as to whether the team should in fact be marketed as Team 96 because the 1908–09 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team was not properly accounted for among the prior teams. The subsequent team was marketed as Team 98.\nSchedule.\nRegular season.\nNovember.\nHardaway began the season with his fourth career double-double by scoring 25 points (including 5-for-5 three-point shooting) and adding 10 rebounds in a 100–62 win over Slippery Rock; this earned him his second career Big Ten Player of the Week award. The 100-point performance of November 9 was Michigan's first since the 2007–08 team posted 103 points against Oakland on December 12, 2007.\nMichigan hosted games for the first two rounds of the 2012 NIT Season Tip-Off. The team's first game of the tournament, a November 12 contest against the IUPUI Jaguars, resulted in a 91–54 Michigan victory. The win also gave Michigan its first consecutive 90-point performances since the 2000–01 team recorded three consecutive 90-point games. The following night, Michigan defeated Cleveland State by a 77–47 margin, marking the first time the school opened the season with three consecutive 30-point victories. The win also marked the first time Michigan had posted three consecutive 30-point wins since the 1988–89 Wolverines team (the 1989 national champion) won five consecutive 30-point games.\nIn the championship rounds of the NIT Season Tip-Off tournament at Madison Square Garden on November 21 and 23, Michigan defeated Pittsburgh and Kansas State, respectively, to win the tournament. Hardaway, who totaled 39 points at the Garden, was the tournament MVP and was joined on the all-tournament team by Burke, who contributed 27 points and 10 assists. Stauskas earned Big Ten Freshman of the Week honors for his NIT tournament performance in which he averaged 12.5 points and 4.5 rebounds. On November 27, Michigan raised its Big Ten championship banner from the season before. Then, the team defeated its first ranked opponent of the season – NC State (#18 AP/#18 Coaches) – in the ACC–Big Ten Challenge. The win was supported by Burke's first career double-double which included a career-high 11 assists, no turnovers and 18 points as well as a career-high 20 points from Stauskas in a 79–72 victory.\nDecember.\nRanked third in both polls, Michigan established a record as the highest ranked visiting team in the history of Carver Arena on December 1. Giving Stauskas his first career start, Michigan emerged victorious over Bradley. It was the third game of the season that Michigan never trailed in. Stauskas repeated as Big Ten Freshman of the Week on December 3 for his back-to-back 20-point performances.\nOn December 4, Michigan defeated Western Michigan 73–41, giving the team its first 8–0 start since the 1996–97 team; the team never trailed in the game. Michigan defeated Arkansas 80–67 in its December 8 matchup. It marked the fourth 9–0 start in school history (1988–89, 1985–86 and 1926–27) and the third consecutive game that Michigan never trailed. Michigan went to 10–0 on December 11 by defeating Binghamton 67–39.\nMichigan traveled to play in the December 15 Brooklyn Hoops Winter Festival at the Barclays Center, where they defeated West Virginia (coach Beilein's previous employer) 81–66 to move to 11–0 for the third time in school history (1985–86 and 1988–89). The team never trailed in the contest. For averaging 23.0 points, 6.5 assists, 4.5 rebounds and 2.0 steals with only 1.0 turnover in the games against Binghamton and West Virginia, Burke earned Player of the Week on December 17.\nOn December 20, the team became the second in school in history (1985–86 went 16–0) to reach 12–0 when it beat Eastern Michigan. After recording his first career double-double in the game with only 18 minutes of play, McGary was recognized as Big Ten Freshman of the Week. Hardaway suffered an ankle injury that caused him to miss the December 29 game against Central Michigan and that broke his 81 consecutive games played streak that went back to the beginning of his Michigan career. The game also marked the team's second game without Jon Horford, who dislocated his knee during the West Virginia game. In Hardaway's absence, Burke posted his second career double-double with 22 points and a career-high tying 11 assists and Robinson posted his second career 20-point game. Stauskas added career highs with 5 three-pointers and 7 rebounds and earned his third Big Ten Freshman of the Week award on December 31. The thirteenth win clinched Michigan's ninth perfect non-conference regular season record. The team never trailed in the contest.\nJanuary.\nOn January 3, Michigan opened the 2012–13 Big Ten conference schedule with a 94–66 win over Northwestern to move to 14–0. Burke had 23 points, 5 assists and a career high 4 steals, while Hardaway added 21 points, Morgan posted a double-double with 12 points and 13 rebounds, while Stauskas and Robinson added 10 points each. Burke and Robinson both posted their third and first career double-doubles, respectively, in a 95–67 victory against Iowa on January 6. It marked the first time that the team scored 90 points in back-to-back conference games since the 1999–2000 team and tied for the most points in a conference game since the 1997–98 team. On January 7, Burke was recognized as Big Ten Conference Player of the Week and Robinson was recognized as Conference Freshman of the Week.\nThe team tied the school record for best start by defeating Nebraska for its 16th straight victory to start the season on January 9. The victory also marked Beilein's 400th Division I coaching victory. On January 13, the team lost to Ohio State (#15 AP/#14 Coaches) snapping their winning streak. Horford returned to the lineup after missing 5 games. Michigan had been the only remaining unbeaten team and was expected to be ranked #1 if they had won. The loss was Michigan's 9th straight in Columbus.\nMichigan defeated Minnesota (#9 AP/#12 Coaches) at Williams Arena on January 17, marking the first time Michigan defeated a top-10 team on the road since a December 6, 1996, victory by the 1996–97 team over Duke. After his performance, in which he scored 21 points while making 7 of 8 shots and 4 of 5 three-point shots, in addition to recording 5 rebounds, 3 assists, 3 steals and 2 blocks, Hardaway earned a second Big Ten Player of the Week Award.\nMichigan defeated Purdue 68–53 on January 24 and Illinois 74–60 on January 27. This gave Michigan the first 19–1 start in school history. Robinson earned his second Big Ten Freshman of the Week award on January 28 for a pair of 12-point performances during a week in which he averaged 8 rebounds while maintaining 71.4% field goal percentage. Later that day, Michigan was ranked number one in the AP Poll with 51 of the 65 first place votes. It marked the first time Michigan ranked atop the AP Poll since the Fab Five 1992–93 team did so on December 5, 1992.\nMichigan concluded January by beating Northwestern a second time on January 30, becoming the first team in the country to reach 20 wins. After enduring an injured ankle against Illinois, starting center Jordan Morgan missed his first game since redshirting a full season for the 2009–10 Wolverines when he sat out the Northwestern game. Horford started in his place.\nFebruary.\nOn February 2, 2013, Michigan (#1 AP/#2 Coaches) appeared on ESPN's College GameDay against Indiana (#3 AP/#3 Coaches) who hosted the game at Assembly Hall. Michigan lost 81–73, but the television broadcast of the game on ESPN set a Big Ten record for viewership with 4.035 million viewers. Morgan only played two minutes behind replacement starter Horford. Michigan then defeated Ohio State (#10 AP/#10 Coaches) in overtime in the rematch at home on February 5. Starting center Morgan only played 4 minutes. Coach Beilein noted that Morgan's absence affected the team's ability to match up defensively and substitute as it desired.\nMichigan lost to Wisconsin on February 9 in overtime following a half-court buzzer beater by Wisconsin that tied the game in regulation It marked Michigan's eleventh consecutive loss against Wisconsin on the road. Morgan did not play, but McGary played 32 minutes, totaling 12 points, 3 steals and 8 rebounds. However, dramatically increased play in Morgan's absence enabled McGary to earn his second Big Ten Freshman of the Week honor on February 11.\nOn February 12, Michigan lost 75–52 in its rivalry game against (#8 AP/#8 Coaches) Michigan State. Among those in attendance were Rick Snyder, Matthew Stafford, Mark Dantonio, Brady Hoke, and Lloyd Carr. It marked the first time both teams were ranked in the top ten of the AP Poll, and resulted in Michigan losing back-to-back games and three consecutive road games for the first time since the 2010–11 team did so. Burke's 18 points, 4 assists and 3 steals were one of Michigan's few bright spots in their February 12 contest.\nOn February 17 against Penn State, Burke posted a season-high 29 points along with 5 assists, 3 rebounds and two steals. As a result of his efforts, Burke won his third player of the week award of the season and fourth of his career on February 18. Morgan returned to the starting lineup in the Penn State contest, but he only played 7 minutes.\nAfter playing only 22 total minutes since January 27, Morgan played more minutes (17) than the other low post players (McGary, Horford, and Max Bielfeldt) for the first time on February 24 against Illinois. Michigan defeated Illinois 71–58 behind 26 points and 8 assists from Burke. In the game, Burke became the seventh Wolverine sophomore to reach 1000 career points. On February 27, Michigan surrendered a 15-point second-half lead to give Penn State its only conference win of the season. Following the game, the team called a rare players-only meeting at the Pizza House, with fifth-year reserve Corey Person doing most of the talking.\nMarch.\nOn March 3, Michigan defeated Michigan State (#9 AP/#10 Coaches) in the Ann Arbor rematch of their rivalry series as Trey Burke made 2 steals in the final 30 seconds to secure the 58–57 victory. Michigan snapped a 453-game streak with at least one made three-point shot and became the first team since February 2009 to defeat a top ten opponent without making one. On March 6, with its Big Ten Conference Championship destiny in its own hands, Michigan defeated Purdue to set up a championship showdown with Indiana on March 10. Michigan concluded its road schedule with a 5–5 record.\nMichigan closed out the season by losing to Indiana (#2 AP/#2 Coaches) on March 10, failing its pursuit of defense of its conference co-championship. Michigan led by 5 with 52 seconds to go, but then missed 3 free throws, including the first attempt during 2 one-and-one situations. Burke and Morgan also missed last-second shots at the rim. Michigan wound down its regular season with its fifteenth sellout and five seniors on the roster: Eso Akunne, Josh Bartelstein, Blake McLimans, Corey Person, and Matt Vogrich. The loss kept Michigan from its first undefeated home season since the 1976–77 team.\nPostseason.\nMichigan participated in the 2013 Big Ten Conference men's basketball tournament at the United Center in Chicago. As the #5 seed, they defeated Penn State in the opening round on March 14 by an 83–66 margin. In the second round, the team lost to Wisconsin, 68–59. Prior to the 2013 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, Jeff Goodman of CBSSports.com named Michigan first among tournament teams in terms of having the most future NBA talent on its roster (in the absence of Kentucky, which was left to accept an invitation to the 2013 National Invitation Tournament). Among Michigan's starting lineup, Burke, Robinson, Hardaway, and McGary were all expected to be likely NBA draft choices, while Stauskas had the potential to be one.\nDespite its highly touted lineup, Michigan entered the tournament as the sixth youngest team in the country and the youngest team in the field of 68 teams according to \"Sports Illustrated\", based on weighted minutes played. The game marked Michigan's first NCAA Championship Monday appearance since 1989. Some sources claim 1993 as the school's last appearance, but those results have been vacated by the NCAA due to the University of Michigan basketball scandal.\nMichigan was entered in the tournament's South region where it would play its first two games at The Palace of Auburn Hills in nearby Auburn Hills, Michigan. As a number four seed, Michigan opened the tournament by defeating South Dakota State 71–56, giving the team its most wins in 20 years and matching Beilein's career high as it raised its record to 27–7. Michigan then ousted 5th-seeded VCU by a 78–53 margin. That gave Michigan its first Sweet Sixteen appearance since the 1993–94 team went to the 1994 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.\nSweet Sixteen.\nThe regional championship rounds for Michigan were at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. On March 29 against Kansas, Michigan overcame a 14-point deficit with 6:50 remaining and a 10-point deficit with 2:52 remaining to force overtime before an eventual victory. Burke scored eight points in the final 1:15 of regulation time, including a game-tying long three-pointer with 4.2 seconds remaining. McGary (25 points and 14 rebounds) and Burke (23 points and 10 assists) both posted double-doubles.\nIn the regional finals on March 31 against Florida, Michigan built a 13–0 lead and never led by less than 10 the rest of the game. Several players had career-highs in the game: Stauskas with 6 three-point shots, Burke 8 rebounds, McGary 5 steals and off the bench Albrecht 7 points and 3 steals. Eight of McGary's 11 points came as Michigan built the initial 13–0 lead and 5 of Stauskas' 6 three-pointers came as Michigan built a 41–17 lead and closed the half with a 47–30 lead. Burke was named South Regional Tournament Most Outstanding Player. McGary and Stauskas joined Burke on the five-man South All-Regional team. Following the regional championship postgame prayer and with Mrs. Beilein's consent, McGary and Hardaway gave Beilein a Gatorade shower.\nFinal Four.\nThe national championship rounds were held at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia. In the April 6 national semifinal against Syracuse, Michigan emerged with its thirty-first victory, the most since the 1992–93 team went 31–5. McGary posted 10 points, 12 rebounds and 6 assists, while the bench contributed 22 points, including 6 from Albrecht, who raised his NCAA tournament total to 5-for-5 on three-point shots.\nMichigan lost the April 8 national championship game against Midwest number one seed Louisville by an 82–76 score. Albrecht scored 17 first-half points on 4-for-4 three-point shooting. Burke scored 24 points in the championship game and made the seven-man All-Tournament team (which was revised multiple times) along with teammates McGary and Albrecht. The turning point of the game was described as a missed call by the referees when, as Michigan trailed 67–64 with 5 minutes left, Burke pinned Peyton Siva's dunk attempt with a clean, all-ball block, but was called for a foul, resulting in two made free throws by Siva. Michigan never got closer than 4 points the rest of the game. Louisville's championship has since been vacated by the NCAA, as well as all its wins from 2011 to 2015. This followed an escort recruitment scandal at the university.\nResults.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#242961; color:#F7BE05;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#242961; color:#F7BE05;\"| Non-conference Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#242961;\"| Big Ten Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#242961;\"| Big Ten tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#242961;\"| NCAA tournament\nStatistics.\nStatistics come from the team's website:\nBurke's 260 assists set a school single-season record.

Existing professionals Bert Demarco, Mike Hines, Paddy Morgan, Bernard Bennett and James Giannaros, rather than participate in the play-offs, opted to accept \"non-tournament\" status, which would allow them to enter only the World Championship.

It was held from 7–16 August, in Sydney, Australia, which secured hosting rights after defeating a rival bid from Manchester, England. Matches were played at Allphones Arena and Netball Central. Sixteen nations competed at the championships, including the top six teams from the 2011 World Netball Championships in Singapore. After two rounds in which teams competed in pools of four, Australia, New Zealand, England and Jamaica contested the semi-finals. Australia defended its 2011 title against New Zealand by a narrow 58–55 victory. The final at Allphones Arena was attended by 16,752 people, a world record for any netball game. Malawian shooter Mwai Kumwenda was the player of distinction.\nOrganisation.\nHosting rights.\nBids to host the 2015 Netball World Cup were submitted to the International Netball Federation (INF) in 2010. The two candidate cities chosen were Manchester, England and Sydney, Australia. In March 2011, INF delegates convened in Singapore, host nation of the 2011 World Netball Championships, to consider both bids. At the end of the conference, Sydney was announced as the host city for the 2015 tournament.\nThis is the second time that Sydney hosted the competition, and the third time in Australia. Sydney last hosted the event in 1991, where Australia won a closely contested final against New Zealand.\nVenues.\nThe sixty four matches were played at the Allphones Arena and Netball Central in Sydney Olympic Park. Allphones Arena hosted the majority of the matches while Netball Central served as the official training venue for all sixteen participating teams. It also hosted pool matches, play-offs and placing games.\nBroadcasters.\nThis is a list of the broadcasters for the tournament in competing countries and regions.\nUmpires.\nSeventeen umpires from six countries officiated matches at the tournament.\nTeams.\nQualification.\nSixteen teams contested the 2015 tournament. The home nation automatically qualified, along with the next five highest-ranked teams from the 2011 World Netball Championships:\nQualification Tournaments\nThe remaining ten teams were determined by regional qualifying tournaments, with two teams selected from each of the five international netball regions; Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania.\nDraw.\nThere was no draw for the tournament, instead the 16 qualified teams were allocated into four pools (A, B, C and D) according to their INF World Rankings of 1 July 2014, as per following criteria:\nRankings reflect the teams' rankings in July 2014.\nFormat.\nThe 2015 tournament consisted of 64 matches played over ten days from 7–16 August. It included three stages – a preliminary pool stage, a qualifying pool stage, and a knockout series of semi-finals and finals. The 16 participating teams were initially divided into four pools (A, B, C and D) of four teams. During the preliminary pool stage, teams in each pool played each other once. In every pool match, two points were awarded to a winning team, while no points were given to a losing team.\nThe qualification round consisted of two First Eight pools (E and F), which were formed from two teams with the highest number of points in each of the preliminary matches pools, and two Second Eight pools (G and H), formed from the bottom two teams in each of the preliminary matches pools. In this stage, teams in each pool played each other once.\nThe two teams with the highest number of points in each of the two First Eight pools advanced to the semi-finals. The winners of the semifinals contested the final, while the losers played for the bronze medal (3rd place). The bottom two teams in each of these pools entered a knockout stage to determine fifth to eighth place. The teams from the two Second Eight pools are similarly divided, eventually entering two knockout stages for 9th to 12th place and 13th to 16th place.\nPlay-off matches.\n5th to 8th\n9th to 12th\n13th to 16th\nPlacement matches.\n5th place\n7th place\n9th place\n11th place\n13th place\n15th place\nSemi-finals and medal matches.\nAt the conclusion of qualifying pool play Australia, England, Jamaica and New Zealand advanced into the semi-finals. This was the fifth time in the last five tournaments that the world's top four ranked sides had reached the semi-final stage. New Zealand led England throughout the first semi-final, pulling away in the last fifteen minutes to post a 50 points to 39 win. In the other semi final Australia eased past Jamaica 67 to 56, outpointing them in three of the four-quarters.\nIn the final Australia outplayed New Zealand in the first quarter to lead 16–7. Despite winning each of the next three-quarters New Zealand were unable to make up the difference. Australia extended their lead to 12 goals early in the second quarter, before New Zealand played their way back into the game. At half-time the score was 30 to 22 and at the start of the last quarter 43 to 37. With a minute remaining Australia led by just three goals, but were able to hold their nerve to record a 58 to 55 goal victory.\nThe defensive work of captain Laura Geitz and Julie Corletto along with accurate goal shooting from Caitlin Bassett helped set up the Australian win. New Zealand goal attack Maria Tutaia said they were too complacent in the first quarter and could not handle the defensive pressure from Australia. Geitz praised her attackers for capitalising on every opportunity and also said that the \"first quarter set us up nicely.\" The Australians shooters scored goals at a 91 percent success rate while their defenders held the New Zealanders to just 73 percent. Corletto retired after the game, ending a twelve-year career that includes 53 tests and three world titles. Australia has now won the World Cup three times in a row and eleven times in total. In the bronze medal match England beat Jamaica 66–44."

        "text": "Peter Bowling (19 December 1864 – 22 February 1942) was an Australian coal miner and trade unionist.\nBowling was born in Stirling, Scotland to miner Patrick Bowling and Marguerite MacGuire. They lived in mining housing in Dunfirmline, Fife. He started working in the mines at the age of twelve and migrated to New South Wales on board the Duke Of Westminster, arriving in Australia when he was 19. He worked around Newcastle. He married Mary Ann Madden at Branxton on 5 September 1889. He worked in Gippsland in the 1890s, where he was involved in founding a miners' union, but returned to New South Wales and in 1893 was elected as an official of the Back Creek miners' lodge. He joined the Australian Socialist League in 1897 and was influenced by the Industrial Workers of the World, supporting direct action and strong unions. Appointed treasurer of the Colliery Employees' Federation, a northern union, in 1904 and president in 1906–10, he was influential in uniting the northern, western and southern unions as the Australian Coal and Shale Employees' Federation in 1908.\nBowling was a militant socialist and supported confrontation against the mine owners, calling for a general strike which eventuated in November 1909. Supporting radical action against the calls for moderation from his fellow mining representative Billy Hughes, Bowling was arrested for conspiracy in Newcastle on 4 December and later physically attacked Hughes while out on bail. In January 1910 Bowling, Daniel Hutton, James Butler and William O'Connor were charged in relation to taking part in a later strike meeting at Bulli on 29 December. Bowling represented himself, while the others were represented by Each were convicted and Judge Rogers sentenced each to imprisonment, Bowling for 12 months and the others 8 months. In February 1910 5 leaders of 2 unions were indicted on 3 conspiracy charges to instigate the coal miners strike in November and December 1909. From the Northern Miners' Federation were Bowling, president, William Brennan, secretary, Amram Lewis, treasurer and from the Amalgamated Coal and Shale Workers Association, Andrew Gray secretary and Albert Burns, treasurer. Bowling, Brennan Burns and Lewis were represented by Mr Gannon and Mr Watt while Gray was represented by Andrew Lysaght. The prosecutors were Ernest Lamb and Thomas Bavin. The jury convicted all 5 and Justice Robert Pring sentenced each of them to imprisonment for 18 months. For Bowling this was to be in addition to the 12 months imposed by Judge Rogers, making a total of two and a half years' imprisonment.\nThe strike ended in defeat in March 1910. Despite this apparent failure, Bowling was used in the Labor campaign for the 1910 state election, appearing on posters in leg-irons; Labor won government for the first time in New South Wales in that election. After his release Bowling visited New Zealand, during which time he lost his union presidency; he subsequently worked in a colliery in Balmain and the abattoir at Homebush. Initially an anti-conscriptionist, he switched to the conscriptionist camp in 1917 after four of his sons enlisted. Robert served in France in the Medical Corp.\nAfter the War, one of his sons jointed the NSW Police Force. Realising through his son that the police had no formed union structure, Bowling was instrumental in the establishment and development of the NSW Police Union.\nIn later years, he and Billy Hughes became close friends, particularly after Hughes' daughter first attempted to commit suicide by trying jumping off a ship steaming out of Perth on the way to the UK. After reaching London and giving birth to a son, she ultimately did suicide. As a single young woman, she was depressed by her pregnancy and feared family shame.\nDuring the 1920s Bowling worked on the Sydney wharves before retiring. He died of cerebral arteriosclerosis in 1942 at Sacred Heart Hospice in Darlinghurst."

        "title": "On the Movements and Habits of Climbing Plants",
        "text": "On the Movements and Habits of Climbing Plants is a book by Charles Darwin first printed in book form in 1875 by John Murray. Originally, the text appeared as an essay in the 9th volume of the \"Journal of the Linnean Society\", therefore the first edition in book form is actually called the ‘second edition, revised.’ Illustrations were drawn by Charles Darwin’s son, George Darwin.\nFollowing the 1859 publication of \"Origin of Species\" Darwin set out to produce evidence for his theory of natural selection. Initially Darwin spent much time in studying plants to achieve this aim. This book stands second in line to his first work on plants, \"On the various contrivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilised by insects.\" (1862)\nThis work is subdivided into chapters concentrating on a particular type of climber which he divided into four main classes but Darwin, in this volume, concentrates on the two main classes, the twining plants and the leaf climbers (divided into two sub-divisions: leaf climbers and tendril bearers)\nThe following comprise the chapters:\n1. Twining plants\n2. Leaf climbers\n3 &amp; 4.Tendril bearers\n5. Hook and Root climbers.\nContext.\nInspired by reading an 1858 short paper by his friend Asa Gray on the movements of tendrils, Darwin set up experiments to explore the development of so many kinds of climbing plants in an evolutionary context. The concept of the power of movement in plants (‘spontaneous revolutions of the stems...’ p. 1) had already been observed as he acknowledges in the first chapter. His conclusions in his last plant book, \"The Power of Movement in Plants\" are key here: i.e. that circumnutation (the process that creates the circular or elliptical movement of the stem and tips of plants) was central in the development of multitudes of adaptations to the environment and thus resulting in an immense variety of plants. The climbing habit evolved from this basic power of movement.\nDarwin conducted, in his own words, \"observations, founded on the examination of above a hundred widely distinct living species.\" This, he maintained, \"contain sufficient novelty to justify me publishing them.\"\nConclusions.\nThe spontaneous revolving habit of stems and tips has evolved in many plant groups in order to obtain light and/or support. Darwin in his conclusion explores the reasons for why these adaptations might have taken place, in what ways they may have been advantageous. For instance, an increased ability to hold on to support (by twining) will be beneficial in windy environments. In tall and dense forests, twining plants would probably succeed better with minor expenditure of organic matter. All this evolved due to an inherent ability to respond to their ‘wants’ by moving. (p. 202). Darwin states: \"It has often been vaguely asserted that plants are distinguished from animals by not having the power of movement. It should rather be said that plants acquire and display this power only when it is of some advantage to them; this being of comparatively rare occurrence, as they are affixed to the ground, and food is brought to them by the air and rain.\" (p. 206)."

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago White Sox, Cincinnati Reds, Atlanta Braves, and Los Angeles Dodgers.\nBaseball career.\nJones attended Pendleton County High School in Falmouth, Kentucky. He was undrafted out of high school, and moved on to Northern Kentucky University and played college baseball for the Northern Kentucky Norse.\nChicago White Sox.\nThe Chicago White Sox selected Jones in the fifth round, 179th overall, in the 2007 MLB Draft.\nJones was assigned to the Rookie-level Bristol White Sox, where he went 0–4 in 10 starts with a 5.13 ERA.

        "title": "James Hubbard (darts player)",
        "text": "James Hubbard (born 24 July 1992) is an English former professional darts player.\nCareer.\nHubbard reached the final of the 2012 PDC World Youth Championship. He beat Michael van Gerwen in the final at the O2 Arena in London on 17 May 2012. As a result of reaching the final, he received a PDC Pro Tour card for 2012. Hubbard's title also earned him an invitation to the 2011 Grand Slam of Darts. He lost against Phil Taylor, Mervyn King and Steve Beaton in the group stage.\nIn May 2012, Hubbard earned a place in the German Darts Championship by defeating Andrew Gilding and Kevin Dowling in the UK qualifier. In the first round of the event in Berlin he pulled off the best result of his career to date by knocking out reigning two-time world champion Adrian Lewis 6–4. He continued his run by defeating Peter Wright in round two, before losing to his practice partner Mervyn King 6–4 in the last 16.\nHubbard also qualified for the third European Tour event, the European Darts Open in Düsseldorf. He beat Andy Hamilton in the first round, and Steve Brown in the second. After defeating Mark Walsh 6–3 in the last 16, a result which secured his qualification for the 2012 World Matchplay, Hubbard shed tears of joy on the stage. He then lost to Richie Burnett 6–2 in the quarter-finals. Hubbard played Wes Newton in the first round of the World Matchplay and was beaten 10–5. In October, he saw off Denis Ovens 6–2 in the opening round of the Dutch Darts Masters, before losing 6–4 to Andy Jenkins. Hubbard qualified for the Grand Slam of Darts again thanks to his 2011 World Youth Championship title, but lost all of three Group C games against Simon Whitlock, Dean Winstanley and Kevin Painter to finish bottom of the table.\nHubbard qualified for the 2013 World Championship, his first, by finishing 34th on the 2012 ProTour Order of Merit, claiming the fourth of sixteen spots that were available to non-qualified players. He lost the opening six legs of his first round match against Richie Burnett to be two sets down, but with the crowd heavily favouring Hubbard, Burnett's form dropped substantially and Hubbard was able to level the match at 2–2. However, the Welshman's experience eventually told as he took the deciding set by four legs to two. Hubbard was ranked world number 52 after the event. He lost 5–3 to Andy Smith in the second round of the UK Open. He had a disappointing year overall as he could not win beyond the last 32 of any ranking tournament.\nHubbard advanced to the third round of the UK Open for the second time of his career in 2014, but was thrashed 9–1 by world number one Michael van Gerwen. At the fifth Players Championship, Hubbard enjoyed notable 6–0 and 6–4 victories over Wes Newton and Van Gerwen in reaching his first semi-final on the PDC tour, which he lost 6–1 to Brendan Dolan. Hubbard won the eighth Youth Tour event of the year by beating Reece Robinson 4–2 in the final.\nHubbard was ranked world number 74 at the start of 2015, meaning he had to enter Q School in order to win his place back on tour. However, he was unable to progress past the last 64 on any of the four days to fall short of earning a new tour card. Hubbard failed to qualify for the UK Open, but played in all 32 of the Challenge and Development Tour tournaments, reaching one quarter-final in the final Development Tour event where he was knocked out 4–3 by Josh Payne. The only European Tour event he reached was the European Darts Trophy, where he lost 6–1 to Rowby-John Rodriguez in the first round.\nIn 2016, Hubbard played in all 19 of the Development Tour events, recording two quarter-final and two semi-final finishes. He qualified for the European Darts Grand Prix but could only average 75.22 during a 6–2 first round loss to Max Hopp.\nPractice.\nHubbard practices and travels with the 2004 World Masters champion Mervyn King, who has tipped Hubbard as a player to watch in years to come. These sentiments were echoed by Simon Whitlock who practiced with Hubbard before the 2012 Grand Slam of Darts.\nPersonal life.\nHubbard is the son of former PDC professional player Vic Hubbard. When not playing darts, Hubbard works as a decorator with his father."

        "title": "Fencing at the 1992 Summer Olympics – Men's épée",
        "text": "The men's épée was one of eight fencing events on the fencing at the 1992 Summer Olympics programme. It was the twenty-first appearance of the event. The competition was held on 1 August 1992. 70 fencers from 30 nations competed. Each nation was limited to three fencers. The event was won by Éric Srecki of France, the nation's fifth victory in the event (second-most behind Italy's six). France also took bronze, with Jean-Michel Henry winning the bronze medal match. France's podium streak in the event extended to four Games. Pavel Kolobkov of the Unified Team took silver.\nBackground.\nThis was the 21st appearance of the event, which was not held at the first Games in 1896 (with only foil and sabre events held) but has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1900.\nThree of the eight quarterfinalists from 1988 returned: gold medalist Arnd Schmitt of West Germany (now competing for united Germany), bronze medalist Andrey Shuvalov of the Soviet Union (now competing for the Unified Team), and fourth-place finisher Sandro Cuomo of Italy. Shuvalov was the reigning (1991) World Champion. Manuel Pereira of Spain was another World Champion (1989) competing in Barcelona.\nEstonia and Singapore each made their debut in the event. Some former Soviet republics competed as the Unified Team. France, Great Britain, Sweden, and the United States each appeared for the 19th time, tied for most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1992 tournament used a three-phase format roughly similar to prior years in consisting of a group phase, a double-elimination phase, and a single-elimination phase, but each phase was very different from previous formats.\nThe first phase was a single round (vs. 3 rounds in 1988) round-robin pool play format; each fencer in a pool faced each other fencer in that pool once. There were 10 pools with 7 fencers each. The fencers' ranks within the pool were ignored; the overall winning percentage (with touch differential and then touches against used as tie-breakers) were used to rank the fencers. The top 52 advanced to the second phase, while the other fencers were eliminated.\nThe second phase was a modified, truncated double-elimination tournament. 12 fencers received a bye to the second round (round of 32), while the 40 fencers ranked 13–52 played in the round of 64. Fencers losing in the round of 64 were eliminated, while the remaining rounds were double elimination via repechages. The repechages (but not the main brackets) used a complicated reseeding mechanism. Ultimately, the 4 fencers remaining undefeated after the round of 8 advanced to the quarterfinals along with 4 fencers who advanced through the repechages after one loss.\nThe final phase was a single elimination tournament with quarterfinals, semifinals, and a final and bronze medal match.\nAll bouts were to 5 touches. In the second and third phases, matches were best-of-three bouts.\nResults.\nGroup round.\nFencers were ranked by win percent, then touch differential, then touches against. This ranking, with adjustments to ensure that no two fencers of the same nation were in the same bracket (noted in parentheses), was used to seed the elimination round brackets.\nElimination rounds.\nMain brackets.\nMain bracket 1.\nCiszewski, Wong, Tanabe, Paz, and Normile were eliminated after the round of 64. The losers in the round of 32 faced off, with Randazzo beating Jang and Davidson beating Pop to advance to the repechage. The losers of the round of 16, Shuvalov and Lazzarini, advanced directly to the first round of the repechage. Vánky, having lost in the round of 8, went to the third round of the repechage. Borrmann won the bracket, advancing to the quarterfinals.\nMain bracket 2.\nSandegren, di Tella, Lenzun, Al-Hamar, and Kuhn were eliminated after the round of 64. The losers in the round of 32 faced off, with Depta beating Schmitt and Kulcsár beating Lee to advance to the repechage. The losers of the round of 16, Shong and de la Peña, advanced directly to the first round of the repechage. Srecki, having lost in the round of 8, went to the third round of the repechage. Kaaberma won the bracket, advancing to the quarterfinals.\nMain bracket 3.\nMaroto, O'Brien, Milan, Ječmínek, and Zuikov were eliminated after the round of 64. The losers in the round of 32 faced off, with Chouinard beating Jacquet and Kravchuk beating Cuomo to advance to the repechage. The losers of the round of 16, Lenglet and Marx, advanced directly to the first round of the repechage. Rivas, having lost in the round of 8, went to the third round of the repechage. Kovács won the bracket, advancing to the quarterfinals.\nMain bracket 4.\nHegedűs, McLean, Kim, Pereira, and Pantelimon were eliminated after the round of 64. The losers in the round of 32 faced off, with Nowosielski beating Lundblad and Mazzoni beating Nawrocki to advance to the repechage. The losers of the round of 16, Henry and Douba, advanced directly to the first round of the repechage. Felisiak, having lost in the round of 8, went to the third round of the repechage. Kolobkov won the bracket, advancing to the quarterfinals.\nRepechage rounds 1 and 2.\nThe fencers were reseeded: the eight fencers who had lost in the round of 16 were reseeded as 1–8 while the eight fencers who had lost in the round of 32 but won the repechage qualifiers were reseeded as 9–16. Rematches of main bracket matches were avoided. For example, original seed #2 Mazzoni would have been reseeded as #9 because he was the top-seeded fencer who had advanced through the repechage qualifiers. That would have placed original #4 Kulcsár as (new) #10, setting up a rematch against (new) #7 de la Peña; Kulcsár and Mazzoni were swapped to #9 and #10, respectively. Original seeds are shown in parentheses in the brackets.\nRepechage round 3.\nThe fencers were reseeded again. Seeds 1–4 were given to round 8 losers, based on their original seeds (Vánky and Felisiak, who had been swapped to avoid having two German fencers in main bracket 1, were reseeded as if they had not been swapped). Seeds 5–8 were given to the winners of the second round of the repechage, based on their original seeds—except that Henry was moved from #6 to #5 to avoid a rematch with Felisiak.\nFinal rounds.\nThe fencers were reseeded a final time. Seeds 1–4 were given to the round of 8 winners, based on their original seeds. Seeds 5–8 were given to the winners of the third round of the repechage, based on their original seeds."

Elvis Gregory earned Cuba's first medal in the event in 88 years with his bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 21st appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1908 (when there was a foil display only rather than a medal event). Five of the eight quarterfinalists from 1988 returned: gold medalist (and 1984 bronze medalist) Stefano Cerioni of Italy, silver medalist Udo Wagner of East Germany, fourth-place finisher Ulrich Schreck of West Germany, and fifth-place finishers Zsolt Érsek of Hungary and Mauro Numa (also the 1984 gold medalist) of Italy. Philippe Omnès of France had been a quarterfinalist in 1984 but had been defeated earlier in 1988; he medaled at all three of the world championships between the Seoul and Barcelona Games, including winning in 1990.\nThe Philippines and Singapore each made their debut in the men's foil; some former Soviet republics competed as the Unified Team. France and the United States each made their 19th appearance, tied for most of any nation; France had missed only the 1904 (with fencers not traveling to St. Louis) and the 1912 (boycotted due to a dispute over rules) foil competitions, while the United States had missed the inaugural 1896 competition and boycotted the 1980 Games altogether.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1992 tournament used a three-phase format roughly similar to prior years in consisting of a group phase, a double-elimination phase, and a single-elimination phase, but each phase was very different from previous formats.\nThe first phase was a single round (vs. 3 rounds in 1988) round-robin pool play format; each fencer in a pool faced each other fencer in that pool once. There were 9 pools with 6 or 7 fencers each. The fencers' ranks within the pool were ignored; the overall winning percentage (with touch differential and then touches against used as tie-breakers) were used to rank the fencers. The top 46 advanced to the second phase, while the other fencers were eliminated.\nThe second phase was a modified, truncated double-elimination tournament. 14 fencers received a bye to the second round (round of 32), while the 32 fencers ranked 15–46 played in the round of 64. Fencers losing in the round of 64 were eliminated, while the remaining rounds were double elimination via repechages. The repechages (but not the main brackets) used a complicated reseeding mechanism. Ultimately, the 4 fencers remaining undefeated after the round of 8 advanced to the quarterfinals along with 4 fencers who advanced through the repechages after one loss.\nThe final phase was a single elimination tournament with quarterfinals, semifinals, and a final and bronze medal match.\nAll bouts were to 5 touches. In the second and third phases, matches were best-of-three bouts.\nResults.\nGroup round.\nFencers were ranked by win percent, then touch differential, then touches against. This ranking, with adjustments to ensure that no two fencers of the same nation were in the same bracket (noted in parentheses), was used to seed the elimination round brackets.\nElimination rounds.\nMain brackets.\nMain bracket 1.\nBravin, Giasson, and Abe were eliminated after the round of 64. The losers in the round of 32 faced off, with Lo beating Wagner and Gosbee beating Abe to advance to the repechage. The losers of the round of 16, Cerioni and Holubytskiy, advanced directly to the first round of the repechage. Gregory, having lost in the round of 8, went to the third round of the repechage. Sypniewski won the bracket, advancing to the quarterfinals.\nMain bracket 2.\nGuerra, Longenbach, Wang L., and Kim were eliminated after the round of 64. The losers in the round of 32 faced off, with O. García beating Busa and Davis beating Ludwig to advance to the repechage. The losers of the round of 16, Schreck and Grigoryev, advanced directly to the first round of the repechage. Omnès, having lost in the round of 8, went to the third round of the repechage. Borella won the bracket, advancing to the quarterfinals.\nMain bracket 3.\nAbdallah, Ichigatani, Krzesiński, and Wu were eliminated after the round of 64. The losers in the round of 32 faced off, with A. García beating Wang H. and Groc beating Bravo to advance to the repechage. The losers of the round of 16, Shevchenko and Érsek, advanced directly to the first round of the repechage. Numa, having lost in the round of 8, went to the third round of the repechage. Wendt won the bracket, advancing to the quarterfinals.\nMain bracket 4.\nMarx, Lhôtellier, and Kiss were eliminated after the round of 64. The losers in the round of 32 faced off, with Nagano beating McKenzie and Ye beating Weidner to advance to the repechage. The losers of the round of 16, Kiełpikowski and Richter, advanced directly to the first round of the repechage. Kajbjer, having lost in the round of 8, went to the third round of the repechage. Betancourt won the bracket, advancing to the quarterfinals.\nRepechage rounds 1 and 2.\nThe fencers were reseeded: the eight fencers who had lost in the round of 16 were reseeded as 1–8 while the eight fencers who had lost in the round of 32 but won the repechage qualifiers were reseeded as 9–16. For example, original seed #2 Ye was reseeded as #9 because he was the top-seeded fencer who had advanced through the repechage qualifiers. Original seeds are shown in parentheses in the brackets.\nRepechage rounds 1 and 2 bracket 1.\nGarcía faced the top two fencers from the group round, beating Cerioni before falling to Ye.\nRepechage round 3.\nThe fencers were reseeded again. Seeds 1–4 were given to round 8 losers, based on their original seeds. Seeds 5–8 were given to the winners of the second round of the repechage, based on their original seeds—except that Ye was moved from #5 to #6 to avoid a rematch with Kajbjer.\nFinal rounds.\nThe fencers were reseeded a final time. Seeds 1–4 were given to the round of 8 winners, based on their original seeds. Seeds 5–8 were given to the winners of the third round of the repechage, based on their original seeds."

        "text": "The men's sabre was one of eight fencing events on the fencing at the 1992 Summer Olympics programme. It was the twenty-second appearance of the event. The competition was held on 2 August 1992. 44 fencers from 19 nations competed. Nations had been limited to three fencers each since 1928. The event was won by Bence Szabó of Hungary, the nation's first victory in the men's sabre since 1964 (the last of its nine-Games winning streak) and 12th overall. Marco Marin took silver while Jean-François Lamour finished with the bronze. Lamour, who had won gold in 1984 and 1988, was unable to win a third title but still became only the second man with three medals in the event (after Aladár Gerevich earned one of each color in 1936, 1948, and 1952). Marin had also finished second in 1984; he was the 12th man with multiple medals in the sabre.\nBackground.\nThis was the 22nd appearance of the event, which is the only fencing event to have been held at every Summer Olympics.

The Citadel Bulldogs baseball team represents The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina and is a member of the Southern Conference of the NCAA Division I. The team played its first season in 1899, but complete records were not kept until after the ACC split prior to the 1954 season. Results listed for seasons prior to that are those compiled by the school from historical accounts and represent the most current information The Citadel has. No team was fielded from 1932 to 1934 or from 1941 to 1946. In addition, the 1917 team was disbanded due to the outbreak of World War I.\nThe Bulldogs are eight time Southern Conference baseball tournament champions, thirteen time regular season conference champions, and have participated in postseason play thirteen times through the 2017 season. In 1990, the team won the Atlantic Regional in Miami, FL and advanced to the 1990 College World Series, becoming the first and (as of 2016) only military school to ever play in Omaha.\nSeason Results.\nNotes.\nSources:"

        "title": "Kris Johnson (basketball)",
        "text": "Kristaan Iman Johnson (born July 18, 1975) is an American former professional basketball player. He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins, winning an NCAA championship his freshman year in 1995. Johnson played eight years professionally in multiple countries, winning the Asian Basketball Confederation (ABC) Champions Cup in 2002 and being named the tournament's Most Valuable Player (MVP). He later worked as a basketball analyst for Fox Sports before starting his own sports website, JerseyChaser.com.\nJohnson played high school basketball for Crenshaw High School, where he was named Los Angeles City Section Player of the Year and won two consecutive California state basketball championships. He and his father, Marques—who played basketball professionally in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and college under legendary coach John Wooden at UCLA—are one of the few father–son combinations to either each be named Los Angeles City Section Player of the Year or to have both won an NCAA basketball championship.\nEarly life.\nJohnson was born in Los Angeles on July 18, 1975, to former NBA player Marques Johnson and health and beauty practitioner Sabrina Sheran. He changed schools often due to his father's changing locations during his professional basketball career. He estimated he attended 27 schools. In 1987, Johnson was instructed to watch his 15-month-old brother, Marques Jr., when his little brother later accidentally drowned in the pool of the family's home in Bel Air in Los Angeles. Johnson contemplated suicide. His parents decided to move Johnson to Atlanta with his mother to ease the pain. He ended up in juvenile court after a school incident and was later kicked out of the Clayton County school system. After repeated conflicts with his mother, Johnson returned to Los Angeles, and he did not speak to his mother for three years.\nJohnson gained weight and was taunted by kids. He played two years at Montclair Prep, where he lost between his freshman and sophomore years. He transferred his junior year from the private school of mostly whites to Crenshaw High School, a predominantly black public school. His father had told him that his best chance of playing for a big Division I college like UCLA was to attend a school like Crenshaw, where Marques had starred. Johnson averaged 22.6 points and 14 rebounds his first season at Crenshaw and won the Los Angeles City Section 4-A Player of the Year; he and Marques, who won the award in 1973, became the first father–son combo to be honored. Johnson won the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) State Division I championship with Crenshaw that season as well as in his senior year in 1994. He averaged 23.3 points and 9.2 rebounds his final season. Johnson associated with gangs while at Crenshaw, which was in the Crips' territory. He was once shot at by a member of the Bloods, a rival gang.\nUCLA career.\nJohnson caught UCLA's attention during recruiting with his ability to score and rebound in traffic. He was tough to defend, especially when he backed in toward the basket. He became the third Crenshaw High basketball player to attend UCLA—his father was the first. Marques had won the 1977 John R. Wooden Award as the college basketball player of the year. Johnson chose UCLA over Washington State, Arizona State, Arizona, Loyola Marymount, Ohio State and Louisville. He was a key player from 1994–98 at UCLA, where he wore his father's No. 54. Like his father, he won a national championship. The Johnsons are one of four father-son duos to each win an NCAA basketball championship. UCLA was 102–27 and won three consecutive Pacific-10 titles during Johnson's career. A swingman with the ability to score in the low post and outside, Johnson was at times between and overweight. Combined with his temper, he was called by one newspaper \"The Round Mound of Sound\", a play on Charles Barkley's nickname of \"The Round Mound of Rebound\". Johnson lost another after his first year. He was listed at in his senior year.\nHe was slowed by arthroscopic surgery the summer before in his college freshman season. After impressive preseason practices during the fall, UCLA coaches projected him as a major contributor. However, he suffered a small stress fracture in his left leg and was sidelined for one month. Johnson returned heavier, but never regained his conditioning and was removed from UCLA's regular rotation. He initially pouted on the bench and was thrown out of practice, but he later became supportive of the team's success and retained his teammates' respect. UCLA won the NCAA tournament, which Johnson in 2009 called \"the greatest experience of his life.\" His second season in 1995–96 ended with UCLA's 43–41 upset loss to Ivy League champion Princeton in the first round of the NCAA tournament. \"There was just a lot of chemistry-type issues about who was going to be the star,\" said Johnson about the team. \"I can't say we were the most focused team going into the tournament. We kind of went into it like, 'Ivy League, schmivey league.' It was a total 'whatever.' What-\"ever\".\" In his junior season in 1996–97, the Bruins won 12 consecutive games before losing in the Elite Eight.\nJohnson was suspended for 50 days in the 1997–98 season, reportedly violating the school's drug policy on marijuana. He also enrolled in a violence intervention program. While nobody ever blamed Johnson for Marques Jr.'s death, he was not able to overcome the guilt over the death until after his suspension. \"I knew I couldn't carry that weight for the rest of my life. My career, everything I had worked for, was hanging in the balance. My life flashed before my eyes,\" he said. Johnson led UCLA in scoring in his senior year with an 18.4 average, 21.1 in Pac-10 play. He also averaged 5.0 rebounds and was named All-Pac-10 honorable mention. He was honored as the team's co-Most Valuable Player along with Toby Bailey and J.R. Henderson. Johnson became so responsible after the suspension that coach Steve Lavin used him as a model for the freshmen. \"The trivial things that made him mad before don't bother him. He sees the bigger picture. He always felt like he had something to prove. Now, he seems at peace,\" said Bailey. The team advanced to the Sweet 16 in the NCAA tournament that season.\nProfessional career.\nThe \"Los Angeles Daily News\" wrote that Johnson lacked the quickness and defensive ability to play shooting guard in the NBA, and was too short to play small forward. He was projected to be an undrafted free agent or a player in Europe. Johnson was drafted by the Yakima Sun Kings in the eighth round with the 67th pick of the 1998 Continental Basketball Association draft. \"I saw him work out in Seattle with (NBA draft picks) Felipe López, Corey Benjamin and Miles Simon, and he was as good or better than those guys,\" said Kings coach Paul Woopert.\nHe played professionally for eight seasons in Russia, Turkey, Qatar, Lebanon, and China. He started playing in Russia for Avtodor Saratov before playing in Turkey for a few months. He returned to the United States and played in the Continental Basketball Association for the Quad City Thunder in the 1999–2000 season and briefly the next season for the Sioux Falls Skyforce in 2000. He next went to Qatar and played in 2001–2003 with Al Rayyan, winning the 2002 Asian Basketball Confederation (ABC) Champions Cup; Johnson scored 32 points in the championship game and was named the MVP of the tournament. He later went to Lebanon to join Riyadi, and then Antranik in 2005.\nOutside basketball.\nJohnson worked at Fox Sports starting in 2008, where he worked for three years and served as a college basketball studio analyst and co-host of a segment named \"Beyond the Arc.\" He managed several business ventures, and started the sports website JerseyChaser.com.\nPersonal.\nJohnson has a younger brother, Josiah, who also played basketball at Montclair Prep and UCLA. Another younger brother, Moriah, enrolled at Tuskegee University in 2011 and joined its basketball team; he also co-starred on the reality television series, \"Baldwin Hills\"."

        "text": "The 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup final was an association football match which determined the winner of the 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup, contested by the women's national teams of the member associations of FIFA. It was played on October 12, 2003, and won by Germany, who defeated Sweden 2–1 in extra time.\nThe tournament was hosted on short notice by the United States, following the withdrawal of China due to an outbreak of SARS, and the final was hosted at the Home Depot Center, a small soccer-specific stadium in Carson, California, near Los Angeles. Both finalists had finished at the top of their groups in European qualification and met at the final of the 2001 UEFA Women's Championship, which Germany won. Germany entered the match as favorites, having finished atop Group C and achieving an upset victory against defending champions United States in the semi-finals. Sweden had emerged from the \"group of death\" by finishing second behind the United States and defeated Brazil and Canada in the earlier knockout stages.\nSweden went into half-time with a 1–0 lead after a goal by Hanna Ljungberg, but conceded an equalizing goal to Germany early in the second half that was scored by Maren Meinert. The match remained tied at 1–1 and was decided by Nia Künzer's golden goal header in the eighth minute of extra time. Künzer's header was the last golden goal to be scored in an official international match. Germany went on to win a bronze medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics by defeating Sweden and repeated as World Cup champions in 2007 against Brazil.\nBackground.\nThe 2003 final marked the twelfth meeting between Germany and Sweden in international women's football and the third time in a FIFA Women's World Cup match. The two teams met in the 1995 and 2001 finals of the UEFA Women's Championship, which were both won by Germany. Germany had won six of their previous matches against Sweden and lost the remaining five, including a 2–1 loss in their most recent meeting at the 2002 Algarve Cup. Germany had previously finished as runners-up in the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup, while Sweden finished third in 1991 by defeating the Germans in the consolation match.\nRoute to the final.\nGermany.\nGermany qualified by topping Group 4, finishing with six wins, 30 goals scored, and one goal conceded. They were placed in Group C alongside South American runners-up Argentina, North American runners-up Canada, and inter-continental play-off winner Japan. The team, managed by Tina Theune-Meyer and named an early favorite prior to the tournament, usually played in a 4–5–1 formation with Birgit Prinz or a 4–4–2 with Prinz and another striker, supported by Bettina Wiegmann leading the midfield and a roster of younger talent. Germany conceded in the fourth minute of its opening match to Canada's Christine Sinclair, who headed in a free kick, but equalized before half-time from a penalty kick awarded for a handball and taken by Wiegmann. The Germans took the lead early in the second half on a header by Stefanie Gottschlich in the 47th minute, which was followed by goals by Birgit Prinz and substitute Kerstin Garefrekes to win 4–1.\nThe team won 3–0 in their second match against Japan, taking first place in Group C with six points, by using its physical advantage and sustained attacks. Sandra Minnert scored in the 23rd minute on a rebound and was followed by strikes from Prinz in the 36th and 66th minutes. Germany advanced to the knockout stage atop Group C by defeating Argentina 6–1 in their third match, earning nine points and outscoring opponents 13–2. The rout of Argentina began in the third minute with a goal for Maren Meinert, which was followed by another for her, a penalty for Wiegmann, and a half-volley for Prinz in the first half. The team lost defender Steffi Jones to a knee injury in the second half and conceded a consolation goal to Argentina before scoring twice at the end of the match to extend their lead.\nGermany played in the quarter-finals against Russia, runners-up of Group D, at PGE Park in Portland, Oregon. The team led 1–0 at half-time, following a goal by Martina Müller in the 25th minute, due to the strong defense offered by the Russians. Germany broke through early in the second half and scored thrice in a five-minute span, including strikes by Minnert, substitute Pia Wunderlich, and Garefrekes. Russia scored a consolation goal in the 70th minute, but Germany scored another trio of goals in the last ten minutes—one more from Garefrekes and two from Prinz.\nIn the semi-finals, Germany faced the United States and defeated them 3–0 in a major upset of the defending champions and hosts. Kerstin Garefrekes's header off a corner kick in the 15th minute opened the scoring for the Germans, while the United States responded by switching to an attack-minded 3–4–3 in the second half and squandered several chances to equalize, forcing saves out of goalkeeper Silke Rottenberg. The Americans pushed forward and left themselves open to counter-attacks, conceding two goals in stoppage time on breakaways that were scored by Meinert and Prinz.\nSweden.\nSweden finished first in Group 2, winning five matches and losing one with a 27–4 goal differential to best runners-up Denmark. They played in Group A, which was dubbed the \"group of death\" for the strong lineup of defending world champions and hosts United States, African champions Nigeria, and Asian champions North Korea. Sweden lost 3–1 in their opening match against the United States in Washington, D.C., conceding twice in the first half to goals scored by Kristine Lilly and Cindy Parlow, both assisted by Mia Hamm. The lead was cut to 2–1 in the 55th minute by Victoria Sandell Svensson, who finished a long pass from Hanna Ljungberg, but American forward Shannon Boxx scored in the 78th minute to give the hosts a victory.\nFour days later in Philadelphia, Sweden defeated North Korea 1–0 with an early goal scored by Svensson in the seventh minute, tying them for second place in the group. Sweden finished second in Group A and advanced to the quarter-finals after their 3–0 victory over Nigeria in Columbus, Ohio, scoring all three goals in the second half. Ljungberg scored twice in the 56th and 79th minutes, the former a header and latter a shot off a pass by Therese Sjögran, and captain Malin Moström scored in the 81st minute on a breakaway.\nIn the quarter-finals at Gillette Stadium, Sweden faced Brazil, who had previously defeated them in the 1995 World Cup and 2000 Summer Olympics. Svensson opened the scoring on a counterattack in the 23rd minute, but Brazil equalized before half-time through a penalty kick taken by Marta after she was tripped by goalkeeper Sofia Lundgren, who had replaced starting goalkeeper Caroline Jönsson. Sweden were awarded a free kick from the goal in the 53rd minute, which was converted into a goal by Malin Andersson, while the team resisted several chances from Brazil to defeat them 2–1.\nThe Swedes then played in the semi-finals against Canada, who had earned an upset victory over China in the quarter-finals. The match remained scoreless in the first half and the deadlock was broken in the 64th minute by Canadian midfielder Kara Lang, who took a free kick from that slipped out of the hands of Jönsson and spun into the goal. Swedish manager Marika Domanski-Lyfors used all three of her substitutions to bring on more attackers, and the equalizer was scored in the 79th minute by Malin Moström from a free kick. Substitute forward Josefine Öqvist scored the winning goal for Sweden six minutes later, finishing a rebound off a shot by Hanna Ljungberg that was saved by goalkeeper Taryn Swiatek.\nVenue.\nThe 2003 final was played at the Home Depot Center, a 27,000-seat stadium in the Los Angeles suburb of Carson, California. The stadium was opened on June 7, 2003, as one of the first American venues to be designed primarily for soccer, serving as the home of the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer (MLS). The final was originally planned to take place at Hongkou Football Stadium in Shanghai, China, but the tournament was moved to the United States after China's withdrawal in April 2003 due to the outbreak of SARS. The Home Depot Center was chosen in June to host four matches during the group stage, the third place play-off, and the final. The Home Depot Center was also selected as the host of the MLS Cup in 2003 and 2004.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nIn the lead-up to the final, Germany were named slight favorites due to their strong midfielders and high goalscoring during the tournament's earlier rounds. Both teams played with 4–4–2 formations to begin the match, but Germany deployed one of its attackers in a deeper position instead of in tandem up top. Romanian match official Floarea Cristina Ionescu was selected as the referee for the final.\nSweden held the majority of possession in the first half, winning more duels in the midfield and earning several chances to score. Germany largely counterattacked while trying to cover gaps in their midfield that also left their attackers isolated. Swedish striker Victoria Svensson and German striker Brigit Prinz each had two chances to score near the half-hour mark, forcing saves out of Silke Rottenberg and Caroline Jönsson, respectively. Malin Andersson attempted a half-volley from in the 30th minute and beat Rottenberg, but the shot went over the crossbar. The opening goal was scored in the 41st minute by Swedish playmaker Hanna Ljungberg, who collected a through pass from Victoria Svensson and shot past Rottenberg from .\nGermany kicked off the second half by scoring an equalizing goal within 40 seconds through a strike in the penalty area by Maren Meinert. Kerstin Garefrekes intercepted a pass in the Swedish half and passed it to Prinz, who provided a diagonal ball to Meinert near the edge of the penalty area. Sweden substituted two midfielders and responded by retreating into a defensive stance while allowing Ljungberg and Svensson to use their pace to create chances. Germany, emboldened by the goal and with control of the game's pace by midfielder Bettina Wiegmann, pushed forward to find more chances. In the 58th minute, they were denied a penalty after Garefrekes was tripped in the box by defender Jane Törnqvist.\nNear the end of regulation time, Ljungberg created three chances to regain Sweden's lead that were missed or saved. Her first attempt in the 81st minute was mishit while open in the box and fell to Frida Östberg, who headed the ball into the side-netting. Ljungberg's second try was shot directly at Rottenberg, while the third was intercepted by two German defenders who collided with her. Ljungberg then headed an overhead ball that fell to Svensson, who volleyed it from only to miss. The match remained tied at 1–1 and advanced into sudden death extra time as the two sides traded chances to score with end-to-end play. Referee Floarea Cristina Ionescu awarded a free kick from after Kerstin Stegemann fell during a challenge from Svensson. Renate Lingor's free kick in the 98th minute found Nia Künzer, a second-half substitute and among the shortest players on the field, who leapt above Kristin Bengtsson to score the match's golden goal with her header. Germany celebrated their 2–1 victory by singing a version of \"Guantanamera\", while Sweden manager Marika Domanski Lyfors confronted Ionescu about her controversial free kick call.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\nPost-match.\nGermany became the first team to surpass the United States at the top of the FIFA Women's World Rankings, which had been established just prior to the World Cup. German captain Bettina Wiegmann and forward Maren Meinert both retired after the match. Künzer's header was the last golden goal to decide an official international match, as the rule had been phased out by FIFA. It was also named the 2003 Goal of the Year by a poll of \"Sportschau\" readers, becoming the first women's goal to be featured.\nThe two finalists went on to meet again in the bronze medal match at the 2004 Summer Olympics, which Germany won 1–0. Germany became the first team to win consecutive Women's World Cups, defeating Brazil 2–0 in the 2007 final played in Shanghai."

A consensus All-American at the University of Kansas, Robinson was drafted fifth overall in the 2012 NBA draft by the Sacramento Kings.\nHigh school career.\nRobinson grew up in Washington, DC, and attended Eastern High School, and Riverdale Baptist before moving on to the Brewster Academy in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire. Robinson averaged 16 points, 13 rebounds and 5 blocks per game his senior year.\nRobinson was ranked as the No. 24 recruit by Scout.com, No. 31 by Rivals.com and No. 40 by ESPN.com as a high school senior.\nCollege career.\nRobinson began his junior year and the 2011–2012 men's college basketball season as one of 50 candidates for the preseason John R. Wooden Award. Along with senior teammate Tyshawn Taylor, Robinson was expected to become one of the leaders for the Kansas team.\nOn December 31, 2011, in a game against the University of North Dakota, Robinson scored 30 points and grabbed 21 rebounds. He was the first Kansas player to record a 30/20 performance since Wayne Hightower scored 36 points and grabbed 21 rebounds in a 1961 game against the University of Missouri. At the end of the Big 12 conference regular season, Robinson was second in the nation with 22 double doubles behind O.D. Anosike of Siena College. At that point, Robinson averaged 18 points and 11.9 rebounds.\nPrior to their game on January 22, 2011, against Texas, Kansas players, coaches and fans held a moment of silence in honor of Robinson, who had lost his grandmother, grandfather, and mother all within three weeks of one another.

Robinson made his first NBA start in the team's next game, a December 17 home contest against the Milwaukee Bucks, racking up 15 points and 16 rebounds to help the Trail Blazers win 104–97.

A state and national representative and prolific goal-kicker, he played his club football in Sydney mainly with Newtown, who have named him as one of their greatest ever players.\nA South Sydney junior player, Clifford started playing in the NSWRFL premiership for the Newtown club in 1951. He played at fullback for Newtown in their loss to Souths in the 1954 NSWRFL season's grand final, kicking six goals.\nIn the grand final of the 1955 NSWRFL season the same two sides again faced each other. Clifford missed a 79th minute field goal attempt and Souths were again victorious.\nIn 1956 Clifford was first selected to represent Australia in the 2nd Test against New Zealand, becoming Kangaroo No. 324. He was selected on the 1956–57 Kangaroo Tour and after the great Clive Churchill was injured in the 1st Test, Clifford took over as Australia's fullback playing in four Test matches and ten tour games and topping the tour points-scoring tally list with 94 points (2 tries, 44 goals). He made his first state appearance for New South Wales in 1957 and the following year with Churchill in his career twilight, Clifford displaced \"the Little Master\" in the domestic three Test series against the visiting British tourists.

        "text": "Cricket in Mauritius is a sporadic affair, with occasional games arranged by enthusiastic zealots replacing any organised competition structure. Four clubs kept the game alive in Mauritius; Maurindia, Star, Spartan and United Cricket Clubs. Maurindia is arguably the leading club and twice yearly plays the Seychelle Islands representative team in reciprocal visits. The number of clubs have recently increased due to the increased popularity of the game in Mauritius and also the increase in expat population on the Island nation. The country currently has the following clubs actively playing cricket in Mauritius \nThere is a Mauritius Cricket Federation, which is not an official member of the International Cricket Council, hence they are not entitled to participate in the official ICC events. Mauritius were at one stage members of the African Cricket Association, with plans in 2011 to travel to Zimbabwe to play the Hindu Gymkhana Club, but they were no longer members by 2021.\nMauritius Cricket Federation is the official body that governs and promotes the sport in Mauritius. The federation is a democratic body with an executive committee. The committee members are electing via a general election every four years. The current president of the Mauritius Cricket Federation is Ali Parkar (G .O .SK)\nIn October 2000, the Beyond The Test World blog in Cricinfo produced its first ever listing about the independent countries and recognised political units where cricket has a presence. Mauritius were listed in the Africa region because there were four cricket clubs there and a cricket tourney, which was one of the criteria for the document.\nBut they did not make the cut\n2006 was a memorable year for Mauritian cricket. The year 2006 has witnessed a transformation in the structure under which the sport is practised in Mauritius.

        "title": "SummerSlam (2012)",
        "text": "The 2012 SummerSlam was the 25th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by WWE. It took place on August 19, 2012, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California for the fourth consecutive year. It was the first SummerSlam held since the end of the first brand extension, which happened shortly after the 2011 event.\nEight matches were contested at the event, including one on the pre-show. In the main event, Brock Lesnar defeated Triple H by submission. In other marquee matches, The Miz retained the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Rey Mysterio, Daniel Bryan defeated Kane, and CM Punk retained the WWE Championship against Big Show and John Cena.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by WWE since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 2012 event was the 25th SummerSlam and was scheduled to be held on August 19, 2012, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California for the fourth consecutive year. It was the first SummerSlam held since the end of the first brand split in August 2011, right after the previous year's event.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised eight matches, including one on the pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\".\nThe most highly promoted match, billed as \"The Perfect Storm\", on the card saw Triple H facing of against Brock Lesnar. On the April 30 episode of \"Raw\", Lesnar attempted to renegotiate his contract with General Manager John Laurinaitis. Triple H (in his corporate role as Chief Operations Officer) intervened, and declared that the contract Lesnar had agreed to upon re-signing with WWE was still valid and thus Lesnar could not add any other clauses to it. This led to a brawl between Lesnar and Triple H resulting in the latter having his arm broken by Lesnar via the Kimura armbar. Triple H returned at No Way Out, not only addressing Lesnar and the lawsuits brought against WWE, but also challenging him to a match at SummerSlam, in exchange for his dropping the lawsuits that his legal representative, Paul Heyman, made against WWE and Triple H. On the June 18 episode of \"Raw\", Heyman made an appearance, rejecting Triple H's challenge on behalf of Lesnar. After further goading from Heyman, Triple H attacked him. Meanwhile, it was announced that Lesnar would respond to Triple H's challenge on the July 2 episode of \"Raw\"; however, at the event it was announced that he would instead return at \"Raw 1000\" on July 23. On that night, Heyman again declined the challenge, but after Triple H's wife Stephanie McMahon slapped him (due to making remarks about their children), Heyman accepted on behalf of Lesnar. Then, on the August 6 episode of \"Raw\", Shawn Michaels made an appearance to announce that he would be in Triple H's corner at SummerSlam. However, Michaels would not make it to SummerSlam after Lesnar used a kimura lock to break his arm on the August 13 episode.\nIn another match, CM Punk defended the WWE Championship against John Cena and Big Show in a triple threat match. In recent weeks, Punk claimed that even though he was WWE Champion, he often felt as if he was pushed to the background in favor of stars like Cena and The Rock. At \"Raw 1000\", The Rock declared he would be getting a WWE Championship shot at the 2013 Royal Rumble PPV. That same night, Cena cashed in his Money in the Bank contract to challenge Punk for the title. After Big Show's interference led to a disqualification, The Rock rushed the ring to help fend off Big Show. Punk would then attack Rock, hitting him with a GTS and turning heel for the first time since 2011. The following week, Cena and Big Show would fight in a number one contender's match for a shot at the WWE Championship at SummerSlam. After Punk's interference led to a no contest, new Raw General Manager AJ Lee announced that Punk would defend the title against both Cena and Big Show in a triple threat match at SummerSlam.\nDaniel Bryan had proposed marriage to AJ on July 16 episode of \"Raw\", which she accepted and agreed to have the wedding as part of \"Raw 1000\". However, during the ceremony, AJ rejected Bryan, and it was announced that she was named as the new GM of Raw by Vince McMahon, which led Bryan to get angry and destroy the wedding decorations in the ring. He was later confronted and insulted by CM Punk, The Rock, and even guest star Charlie Sheen. After a loss to Sheamus in a street fight on July 30 episode of \"Raw\", Bryan underwent a psychological exam (under orders from AJ as retaliation for finding out that Bryan planned on having her committed to a mental institution after they were legally married) and was attacked by Kane (who claimed he was Bryan's \"anger management therapist\"). On the August 6 episode of \"Raw\", AJ booked Bryan to wrestle Kane at SummerSlam.\nAnother match on the card was between Dolph Ziggler and Chris Jericho. At Money in the Bank Ziggler won the Money in the Bank ladder match for the World Heavyweight Championship contract, while Jericho failed to win his Money in the Bank ladder match for the WWE Championship contract. The next night on \"Raw\", Jericho interrupted Ziggler's victory speech. Ziggler then put Jericho's recent performances under question, claiming that Jericho \"can't win the big ones anymore\" and \"lost his touch\". Jericho responded by nailing Ziggler with a Codebreaker. On \"Raw 1000\" during a six-man tag team match, Ziggler hit his tag-team partner Jericho, causing him to lose the match. On the July 27 episode of \"SmackDown\", Jericho (wearing Ziggler's gear) threw Ziggler in the ring to be Brogue Kicked by Sheamus. On the August 6 episode of \"Raw\" Ziggler faced Alex Riley, but lost due to being distracted by Jericho. It was announced on the August 10 episode of \"SmackDown\" that Ziggler would face Jericho at SummerSlam.\nIn 2011, The Miz and Rey Mysterio feuded after Mysterio defeated Miz in a tournament finals to crown a new WWE Champion. During a house show, Mysterio faced Miz again, but during the match, Mysterio was injured, forcing him to undergo surgery and remain inactive, which was blamed on storyline to an attack by Alberto Del Rio. Ten months later, on the July 16 episode of \"Raw\", Mysterio made his return attacking Del Rio with a \"619\". Meanwhile, in \"Raw 1000\", The Miz defeated Christian to win his first Intercontinental Championship. After his return, Mysterio declared his intention to become Intercontinental Champion. During the August 10 episode of \"SmackDown\", Mysterio defeated The Miz in a non-title match. Therefore, Mysterio received a title match against Miz at SummerSlam.\nAt Money in the Bank, after The Prime Time Players (Darren Young and Titus O'Neil) were defeated by Primo &amp; Epico, The Prime Time Players confronted WWE Tag Team Champions Kofi Kingston and R-Truth and tried to attack them, to which R-Truth threw a bottle of water at the Prime Time Players' manager Abraham Washington, starting a feud between the two teams. On the July 16 episode of \"Raw\", Kingston and Truth successfully defended the WWE Tag Team Championship against the Prime Time Players. On the August 10 episode of \"SmackDown\", The Prime Time Players defeated Primo &amp; Epico by disqualification after Kingston and Truth, who were at the commentators table, attacked Washington, earning a WWE Tag Team Championship match against reigning champions Kingston and Truth at the pay-per-view.\nSince April, World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus entered a feud with Alberto Del Rio around the championship after Del Rio defeated Sheamus by disqualification on the April 6 episode of \"SmackDown\", after Del Rio faked being hit with a steel chair, winning a championship opportunity in the future. That opportunity was not granted until Over the Limit, where Sheamus retained against Del Rio, Chris Jericho and Randy Orton. During the following weeks, the two continued their feud, which directed to a match at No Way Out, in which Dolph Ziggler replaced Del Rio (due to Del Rio suffering an injury on the June 6 episode of \"SmackDown\"), where Sheamus again retained. When Del Rio returned, they immediately resumed their feud, facing again at Money in the Bank, where Sheamus again defeated Del Rio. However, Del Rio demanded one more match, which he got after defeating Kane, Rey Mysterio and Daniel Bryan on the July 27 episode of \"SmackDown\", setting up a match between Del Rio and Sheamus at SummerSlam. On the August 10 episode of \"SmackDown\", Del Rio attacked Sheamus with the help of fake policemen that Del Rio himself hired, in revenge for Sheamus stealing his car earlier that week on the August 6 episode of \"Raw\", leading to Booker T, the newly appointed General Manager of \"SmackDown\", to cancel the match between Del Rio and Sheamus for the title, angering Del Rio. However, the following week on \"SmackDown\", after Del Rio defeated Chris Jericho, Sheamus asked for the match to be reinstated, which was accepted by Booker T.\nOn the August 13 episode of \"Raw\", it was announced that \"Jersey Shore\" personality Pauly D would be the social media ambassador for the event.\nWWE legend Mick Foley was scheduled to face the debuting Dean Ambrose at the event. Ambrose had accused Foley for being the cause of a lost generation at WrestleMania Axxess and would to continue to insult him on Twitter. However, Foley was not cleared to compete by his doctors, he announced his final retirement, and the match was scrapped. Ambrose would make his debut later in the year as part of the stable The Shield.\nEvent.\nPrior to the pay-per-view, Antonio Cesaro, who had been accompanied by Aksana, defeated Santino Marella to win the United States Championship after a Neutralizer.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe first match that aired from the show pitted Chris Jericho against Dolph Ziggler. Jericho's rib injury came into play when it cost him too much time to cover Dolph after performing a frankensteiner on Ziggler. Dolph was very close to victory after raising his knees when Jericho tried for the Lionsault and then executed the Zig Zag for a near-fall. Jericho executed a Codebreaker, but the momentum from the move knocked him out of the ring. Jericho made Ziggler submit to the Walls of Jericho to win the match.\nThe second match in the pay-per-view was between Daniel Bryan and Kane. Kane went crazy after Bryan slapped him in the face. Kane's anger opened things up for Bryan, but he was unable to apply the No Lock. Bryan attempted a diving headbutt, but Kane grabbed him by the throat when he landed and then performed the chokeslam. Kane was still angry about the slap and decided to give him the Tombstone Piledriver instead of going for the win. Bryan was able to reverse the move into a small package on Kane to win before immediately fleeing to the back. Following the match, Kane was shown tearing apart the backstage area while searching for Bryan.\nNext was the Intercontinental Championship match between the champion The Miz and challenger Rey Mysterio. During the match, Mysterio was able to execute the 619 but missed when he tried Droppin' Da Dime on The Miz. A few moments later, Miz executed the Skull Crushing Finale to get the win.\nMain event matches.\nThe World Heavyweight Championship was on the line next with Sheamus defending his title against Alberto Del Rio. Rodriguez threw a shoe to Del Rio, but Sheamus caught it instead and hit Del Rio with it. He then executed an Irish Curse on Del Rio and pinned him to retain the championship, but Del Rio had his foot on the ropes, which should have resulted in a rope break, but referee Mike Chioda didn't see that and thus allowed Sheamus to retain his title.\nThe next match was for the WWE Tag Team Championship between R-Truth and Kofi Kingston and the number one contenders The Prime Time Players (Darren Young and Titus O'Neil). Kofi got rid of O'Neil with a flying body press outside of the ring. Inside of the ring, R-Truth performed the Lie Detector on Young to get the win.\nA triple threat match was up next, which saw CM Punk defending his WWE Championship against John Cena and Big Show. Big Show dominated the match, but Cena and Punk were able to eventually wear him down. Punk trapped Big Show's head in a Koji clutch while Cena put Big Show in the STF, which caused Big Show to submit. Because of the confusion over who won the match, AJ Lee came to the ring and restarted the match. Cena was able to execute the Attitude Adjustment on Big Show. Punk however, then tossed Cena out of the ring and pinned Big Show to get the win and keep the title.\nIn the final match, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by Paul Heyman) faced Triple H. Lesnar was focused on the arm of Triple H which he broke a few months ago. He slammed Triple H on his arm on top of the announcers table. The referee refused to start the count when Triple H was outside of the ring. Lesnar controlled the match until Triple H tossed him stomach-first into the announcers table. Lesnar had some major problems with his stomach that led to him retiring from Ultimate Fighting Championship. After many knees to the gut, Triple H performed a Pedigree for a near-fall. Lesnar got back into the bout with a blatant low blow. He then connected with the F-5, but Triple H was able to kick out. Lesnar then put Triple H in the Kimura lock and refused to break it when Triple H reached the ropes. Triple H got out with a few shots to the body and then performed another Pedigree. When he went for the pin, Lesnar put Triple H in the Kimura lock again and the fallen Triple H could do nothing but submit. Following the match, Triple H seemed to be completely beat, and the announcers wondered whether he was going to retire.\nAftermath.\nThe following night on \"Raw\", Dolph Ziggler challenged Chris Jericho to a rematch, to which the general manager AJ Lee made official, with the added stipulation that Ziggler's Money in the Bank contract and Jericho's WWE contract were on the line. Ziggler would go on to win the bout, resulting in Jericho being terminated from the company; this was done so Jericho could join his band Fozzy on their European tour. Jericho was eventually rehired and would later return at the 2013 Royal Rumble.\nLater on during the same show, CM Punk announced his intentions of defending his WWE Championship against John Cena in the near future. On the August 27 episode of \"Raw\", AJ announced that Punk would defend the title against Cena at Night of Champions, continuing their feud. Punk lost the WWE Championship at the 2013 Royal Rumble against The Rock.\nDaniel Bryan and Kane continued their rivalry after the match, leading to the formation of Team Hell No. They would end up working together and getting along, including winning the WWE Tag Team Championship at Night of Champions.\nLastly, Brock Lesnar announced on Tout during the show that he had quit the WWE since there was no more competition. In reality, Lesnar was taken off television as he had limited appearances on his contract. He would return on the January 28 episode of \"Raw\". Triple H seemingly announced his retirement on the August 27 episode of \"Raw\", but returned on the February 25, 2013, episode. The following week, which celebrated \"Old School Raw\", Triple H challenged Lesnar to a match at WrestleMania 29. Paul Heyman accepted the challenge and declare the match to be a No Holds Barred match, with the added stipulation that if Triple H lost, he would have to retire. On the April 1 episode of \"Raw\", Shawn Michaels returned and announced that he would be in the corner of Triple H at WrestleMania. At WrestleMania, Triple H defeated Lesnar after hitting him with his signature Sledgehammer and the Pedigree on the steel steps in the ring. The two had their rubber match at Extreme Rules in a Steel Cage match, which Lesnar won."

Messi and Thiago forced saves from Santos goalkeeper Rafael Cabral in the 12th minute. Messi then scored with a chip over Cabral in the 17th minute. Seven minutes later, Xavi scored a second with a strike from just inside the penalty area. Santos came back with a short-range effort by Borges that was saved by Barcelona 'keeper Víctor Valdés, before Cesc Fàbregas hit the post two minutes later and then scored Barcelona's third goal just before the half ended.\nIn the second half, Santos improved and teenage star Neymar finally had a chance for Santos in the 57th minute when he was one-on-one with Valdés, but the shot was saved.

        "text": "The 2013 UCI Road World Championships took place in Tuscany, Italy, between 22 and 29 September 2013.\nThe Championships consisted of 12 events for elite, under-23 and junior cyclists. It was the 86th Road World Championships, the 13th in Italy and the first time that the event took place in Tuscany. The different events finished near the Nelson Mandela Forum in Florence. Host cities for the starts were Florence, Pistoia, Lucca and Montecatini Terme.\nMarketing.\nTickets for crucial points of the course in Florence and Fiesole could be bought in advance. Ticket prices ranged from 20 Euro to 100 Euro for seating near the finish line of the men's road race. Related to the Championships, many events were organized including expositions, exhibitions, a cyclosportive, and the Bicycle Film Festival. Poste italiane made a stamp dedicated to the Championships in 3.290,000 pieces and Chianti Classico produced wine bottles with special Championships labels.\nMascot Pinocchio.\nThe organizers showed the mascot for the event, Pinocchio the brainchild of Florentine writer Carlo Collodi, on 26 October 2012. The wooden figure is dressed in a rainbow sweater and a hat with the same motif. The choice of Pinocchio, whose nose grows when he lies, appeared to be significant after the cycling world was rocked by the doping case of Lance Armstrong. The decision for the mascot however, was taken much earlier according to the organizers.\nTraveling.\nTo promote the public transport, more trains ran during the Championships to Florence and a special ticket was produced to ride on all regional trains. For safety reasons, all schools in Fiesole were closed on 27 and 28 September, because reaching schools was complicated.\nEvents summary.\nElite events.\nOn the first day, the team time trial events were for the second consecutive year won by (women) and (men). The men's squad's victory in the men's team time trial came by 0.81 seconds over . Ellen van Dijk from the Netherlands, who won a gold medal in the women's team time trial, won her second gold medal in the women's time trial. Van Dijk won with an advantage of 24 seconds over Linda Villumsen, who finished on the podium for the fourth successive Championships. Van Dijk became the second Dutch woman to win in the discipline, after Leontien van Moorsel's victories in 1998 and 1999. Tony Martin, who also won with his team a gold medal in the team time trial, won his third successive men's time trial gold medal, beating main rivals Bradley Wiggins and Fabian Cancellara. In the last weekend of the championships, Marianne Vos won her third gold and her eighth medal in the women's road race. With help from Anna van der Breggen who helped close down the breakaway attempts, Vos made her break on the final ascent of the long Via Salviati – with around to go – and soloed to a 15-second victory over Emma Johansson and Rossella Ratto. On the last day of the Championships, Rui Costa from Portugal won the rain-soaked Men's road race as he beat Spain's Joaquim Rodríguez by a bike-length on the finish line, with Alejandro Valverde from Spain taking bronze.\nJunior events.\nAfter winning the women's junior time trial at the European Championships, Séverine Eraud won the women's junior time trial at the Road World Championships. European runner-up Igor Decraene won the gold medal in the men's junior time trial. In the women's junior road race won Amalie Dideriksen the sprint from Alexandria Nicholls and Alexandra Manly. The three riders escaped with one other rider on the first lap. Mathieu van der Poel won the men's junior road race. He attacked in the closing stage and soloed to the finish. It was van der Poel's first road world title, having previously won two junior world titles in cyclo-cross, in 2012 and 2013.\nParticipating nations.\n76 nations participated. Two riders from Uganda were on the start list for the men's and women's time trial but did not start. One rider from Iran was registered for the women's team time trial, but did not start.

Pune Strykers got into early lead when Tyron Pereira's cross creeped in during the 4th minute of the game. Pune's joy was short-lived as V.S. Vinaya neutralized off their first penalty corner a minute later. Prabhjot Singh and Deepak Thakur led Punjab's attacks and were awarded with couple of penalty corners but could not be converted. Few close shots were saved by the goal-keeper Gurpreet Guri Singh. Attacks on the other end were made by Argentine recruit Mario Almada, Roshan Minz, Nikkin Thimmiah and Bikash Topo.

Skipper Prabhjot Singh in the 47th minute gave Punjab a two-goal cushion with a reverse-stick over Pune before the end off the third quarter. Sher-e-Punjab continued the tempo in the 4th quarter with Punjab's penalty-corner specialist Harpeet Singh converted off a penalty corner with a drag-flick.

Simrandeep Randhawa added a consolation goal to Pune's tally by converting a penalty corner in the last minute and the match ended with Sher-e-Jalandhar 5, Pune Strykers 2 making Sher-e-Punjab the winners of the first WSH."

He was later fined a total of £11,000, and warned he would be suspended from the tour for three months if he breached the rules again in the next six months. Allen was also ordered to undergo media training.\nIn his match against Stuart Bingham, Stephen Hendry made the 10th maximum break to be made at the event. This was the 88th official maximum, and Hendry equalled two records held by Ronnie O'Sullivan: the most official maximum breaks in professional snooker (11) and the most at the venue (3). Hendry won the match 10–4 in a rematch of one of his greatest upset defeats, in the first round of the 2000 World Snooker Championship when Hendry was defending champion and Bingham was making his television debut. Zhu Ying became the first Chinese person to referee a match at the Crucible by officiating the match between Hendry and Bingham. Mark Williams stated on Twitter before the championship that he hated the Crucible and wished that the tournament was played in China. Williams was subsequently booed as he was announced to the crowd before his opening match, and was later fined a total of £4,000.\nDing Junhui and Ryan Day went to a , which was won by Day. Ding said that the table conditions were not right and complained about spectators being disruptive during the match. He was later fined £250, and warned by the chairman of the Disciplinary Committee for swearing during the live press conference. In his match against Ken Doherty, Neil Robertson made three consecutive century breaks, as he completed a 10–4 victory. Andrew Higginson and David Gilbert reached the second round of the event for the first time in their respective careers. Higginson defeated Stephen Lee 10–6, and Gilbert defeated Martin Gould 10–8.\nHalf of the seeded players were beaten in the first round. Bingham, Graeme Dott, Murphy, Lee, Gould, Ding Junhui, Allen and Selby all lost their places in the tournament. This marked the most top 16 players to suffer defeat in the first round since 1992. There was the most Asian players in the history of the event, five.\nSecond round.\nThe second round was played from 26 to 30 April, as the best of 25 frames held over three sessions. Multiple time winners Higgins and Hendry had made 45 appearances at the Crucible between them, having both had played in every tournament since 1995; but this was the only time they ever met at the Crucible. Higgins made the 500th century break of his career in his match against Hendry. Two frames later Hendry made his 775th. Hendry defeated Higgins 13–4 to reach his 19th quarter-final at the event. At that time only eight players had played at the Crucible at least that many times: Hendry, Steve Davis, Jimmy White, Terry Griffiths, John Parrott, Peter Ebdon, Willie Thorne and O'Sullivan. Ali Carter trailed Judd Trump 9–12, but won the next four frames to win 13–12. In the deciding frame Trump needed four and got three, before Carter finally potted the last remaining red ball.\nCrucible debutant Jones reached his first ranking event quarter-final by defeating Andrew Higginson 13–10. After the second session Jones led 10–6; before Higginson won the four opening frames of the last session to tie the score 10–10. Jones took the next three frames to win the match. He became the third Welshman into this year's quarter-finals, following Day and Matthew Stevens. Robertson led Gilbert 5–3 and 10–6 before winning 13–9. Day defeated Cao 13–7 to reach the quarter-finals for the third time. Eighth seed Maguire defeated Perry 13–7, whilst O'Sullivan defeated Williams 13–6, having won six frames in a row in the second session.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played on 1 and 2 May as the best of 25 frames, held over three sessions. Hendry was defeated by Maguire with a , 13–2. Hendry won only one of the eight frames in the opening session, with Maguire winning the first four frames of the second session. Hendry won frame 13, but Maguire won the next two frames to complete the victory. After the match Hendry announced his immediate retirement from professional snooker, citing dissatisfaction with his standard of play in recent years and difficulty balancing competitive, commercial and personal commitments. Hendry would be in retirement until 2020, when he announced he would play again on the Tour, playing his next professional event at the 2021 Gibraltar Open.\nStevens played Day, but trailed 2–5 in the first session. He won the final frame of that session, all eight frames of the second session, and won the match 13–5 after taking the first two frames of the third session. This was the first time he had reached the semi-finals since he played in the 2005 final. Carter led 2–1 before Jones tied the scores with a break of 127. However, Carter won three of the next four to lead 5–3 after the first session. Jones completed back-to-back centuries in the second session, but still trailed by two frames after the second session, with Carter winning the match 13–11. Robertson took a 5–3 lead over O'Sullivan after the first session of their match, but O'Sullivan won six straight frames to take a 9–7 lead after the second. O'Sullivan won the match 13–10, making a further two century breaks in the final session.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played as the best of 33 frames held over four sessions on 3, 4 and 5 May. Carter met Maguire, and led 5–3 after the first session. Maguire made a 142 break in frame 15, but still trailed after the second session by four frames. The pair shared the eight frames of the third session, with Carter leading 14–10. Carter then won three of the next five to win the match 17–12. Earlier in the season, Carter had considered retiring from the game, due to struggles with Crohn's disease. Hendry, acting as a pundit for BBC Sport, commented how Carter had \"frustrated\" Maguire during the match.\nO'Sullivan met Stevens in the other semi-final. This was O'Sullivan's ninth world championship semi-final, and Steven's fifth. O'Sullivan led the match 5–3 after the opening session, but won six of the eight in the second to lead 11–5. The pair shared the eight frames of the third session, leaving O'Sullivan 15–9 ahead. Stevens took the first frame in the fourth session, before O'Sullivan made a break of 130 in frame 26, and won the next frame to complete a 17–10 victory. Snooker pundit John Parrott likened playing O'Sullivan to be as difficult as \"hold[ing] a tiger by the tail\".\nFinal.\nThe final was played on 6 and 7 May as the best of 35 frames held over four sessions between Carter and O'Sullivan. This was the second time that the pair had met in the final of the event, with O'Sullivan defeating Carter 18–8 in the 2008 final. This was O'Sullivan's fourth world championship final, having won the prior three, whilst Carter was featuring in his second. Carter had never beaten O'Sullivan in 11 previous attempts in ranking events before this match. O'Sullivan made two century breaks in the opening session, including a 141 break in the eighth frame, the highest in a world championship final to date. The previous record was 139 made by O'Sullivan in the 2001 final. The pair were tied at 3–3, but O'Sullivan won the final two frames of the session to lead 5–3. O'Sullivan won four of the next six to lead 9–5, and led 10–7 overnight. A break of 101 by O'Sullivan saw him lead 11–7 and he then won the next three frames to lead 14–7. Carter won the next three frames, including a century break, before O'Sullivan won the final frame of the session to lead 15–10. Only four frames were played in the final session, as O'Sullivan won three of them to complete a 18–11 victory.\nThis was O'Sullivan's fourth championship, and was the oldest person to win the event since Dennis Taylor in 1985. O'Sullivan praised the work of Steve Peters, his sports psychologist, for the victory, saying: \"I wouldn't have been playing if it wasn't for Steve... I've stuck in there. I've had to face things that I didn't want to face.\" Carter would comment that his opponent was \"the better man\", but that he was disappointed to lose. This was the twelfth meeting between the pair in ranking competitions, with O'Sullivan winning all of them. Carter would eventually defeat O'Sullivan at the event in the second round of the 2018 World Snooker Championship. After the event, O'Sullivan announced he would take a six months sabbatical from the sport; however, he only played one competitive match before the following year's event, which he also won.\nMain draw.\nShown below are the results for each round. The numbers in parentheses beside some of the players are their seeding ranks (each championship has 16 seeds and 16 qualifiers). The draw for the first round took place on 16 April 2012, one day after the qualifying, and was broadcast live by Talksport.\nQualification draw.\nPreliminary qualifying.\nThe preliminary qualifying rounds for the tournament were for WPBSA members not on the Main Tour and took place on 5 April 2012 at the World Snooker Academy in Sheffield.\nRound 1\nRound 2\nQualifying.\nThe qualifying rounds 1–4 for the tournament that took place between 6 and 12 April 2012 at the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield. The final round of qualifying took place between 14 and 15 April 2012 at the same venue. Robert Milkins made the 87th official maximum break during his round four qualifying match against Xiao Guodong on 11 April 2012. This was the second maximum break of Milkins' career.\nRound 1\nRounds 2–5\nCentury breaks.\nMain stage centuries.\nA total of 71 century breaks were made during the main stage of the World Championship. For every century break that was made during the 17-day championship in Sheffield, the title sponsor, Betfred, donated £200 to World Snooker's official charity for the 2011/2012 season, Haven House Children's Hospice, with the promise of topping it up to £25,000 if 75 centuries were made. However, Betfred boss Fred Done donated the full £25,000, despite being four centuries short of the target.\nQualifying stage centuries.\nA total of 60 century breaks were made during the qualifying stage of the World Championship, the highest a maximum break made by Robert Milkins."

        "text": "The Georgia Southern Equestrian Team (GSUET) is a club sport available to students at Georgia Southern University. The club develops an understanding in equestrian activities and horsemanship and unites collegiate horse owners, riders, and anyone interested in horses. It introduces members to equine activities in the community. Team members who join the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association (IHSA) compete with other IHSA team in horse shows hosted by different barns in the southeast. Individuals and the team compete in Zone 5, Region 3 of the IHSA. Each member takes two lessons a week. The Georgia Southern Equestrian Team students are taught grooming, feeding, and health care skills. All riding disciplines are presented and the facility provides well-trained horses for the riders. The GSUET is funded mostly by its members' team fees. However, each year the team is also allotted a budget from Georgia Southern's CRI (Campus Recreation and Intramurals). Many of the saddles and other tack used by the team are purchased through CRI. Team members pay for their own riding lessons, riding attire, show clothes, and entry fees for shows.\nLocation.\nThe Georgia Southern Equestrian Team rides at Evermore Farm. . Evermore Farm is located in Bulloch County, Georgia, near Brooklet, Georgia and is about half an hour from the Georgia Southern University.\nEvermore Farm is a full service equestrian center.\nAccomplishments.\nEvermore Farm students have competed successfully since 1990 at local and national shows in several disciplines, including United States Equestrian Federation (USEF), American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA), Palomino Horse Breeders Association, (PHBA) Intercollegiate Horse Show Association (IHSA), Coastal Hunter Circuit (CHC), Progressive Show Jumping (PSJ) and 4-H. Their horses and riders have won top ribbons at many shows and events, including a World Champion, and Reserve National Champion.\nAt the IEA National Championship held in Conyers, Ga., the Georgia Southern Equestrian Team placed third out of 19 teams that qualified out of more than 200 teams nationwide. They also placed second at the Leefield finals.\nHistory.\nThe Georgia Southern Equestrian Team was founded in 1993 by four members: Celest Youmans, Betsey Fagin, Wendy Wheeler, and Fran Becket. The first coach employed by the GSUET was a student coach, team member Fran Becket. The team used Wolfpen Farm facilities as their home base for shows and lessons. The team was not having good luck with finding horses that could participate with the team. They used mostly their own horses and borrowed some horses from the community for shows.\nIn 1998, the GSUET moved to Evermore Farm in Brooklet, about a 30-minute drive from the GSU campus. They also hired Elanor Ellis as their new coach, who is still the coach today. \nIn 1999, a certified American Quarter Horse Association judge, Ms. Jones, left UGA and worked with Georgia Southern for a year to help improve the equestrian program.\nShowing.\nThe team at Georgia Southern is part of a large network of equestrian teams in the southeast. The United States is divided into zones and each zone is divided into regions. Currently the GSUET is located in Zone 5, Region 3. The team competes against several colleges in the southeast including; Georgia Tech, Georgia State, Emory, Wesleyan, College of Charleston, Florida State, University of Florida, and University of Miami. Each year members of the GSUET compete to earn points in order to move up in their show classes, which range from beginner's walk/trot to the more experienced open levels. Once a rider earns enough points to move up a class, they qualify to compete at regionals. From regionals, first through third-place winners then advance to zones where the first and second-place winners move on to nationals, where many GSUET members have competed before. The GSUET made its presence well known at the 2006 nationals as its entire western team competed after winning first place in the region, and second in the zone. Along with the western team an English rider took tenth in Advanced Walk/ Trot/Canter.\nFundraisers.\nOn February 26, 2011, Georgia Southern University Equestrian Team hosted their third annual Spring Fling at Mill Creek Regional Park in Statesboro, Georgia.\nProceeds from entertainment were donated to the Bulloch County Humane Society \nFun activities included carnival rides, games, contests, and a petting zoo \nThe Swinging Medallions, a local cover band, provided entertainment throughout the day, and a dance off competition was also held."

        "text": "Collegiate Baseball League Europe (CBLE) is a wood bat summer collegiate league based in Oosterhout, the Netherlands.\nThe league currently consists of two divisions, the East Division (Vienna Emperors, Prague Dragons and Amsterdam Bombers) and the West Division (London Cavaliers, Sant Boi Falcons of Barcelona and La Rochelle Admirals). Players can apply individually and have the opportunity to choose their preferred division.\nEach year the coaching staffs draft their team rosters from the list of registered players in the month of April. Players typically play their regular season at college teams in North America or with club teams in elite leagues across Europe.\nHistory.\nThe league was founded in 2012 and is based at Oosterhout in the Netherlands.\nThe inaugural tournament was held in July 2012 with 56 players from 10 different countries. All games were played at \"Sportpark de Slotbosse Toren\" in Oosterhout the Netherlands, home of the Dutch pro team Oosterhout Twins.\nIn 2014 the league expanded to baseball venues in London (GBR), Barcelona (ESP) and La Rochelle (FRA). As the only collegiate summer league in \"the Old World\", CBLE aims to offer players age 18-23 a great summer experience with high level baseball and a nice piece of Europe at the same time.\nOn April 17, 2014, CBLE announced an agreement with the Northwoods League to offer their top players the opportunity to play with the Elite College players in the US. The agreement between the two summer collegiate leagues is first of its kind.\nIn September 2014, 10 CBLE alumni represented 5 different countries at the European Baseball Championship in Germany and the Czech Republic. The game France vs. Belgium on September 16 featured former CBLE players Owen Ozanich (Falcons 2012) and Ben van Nuffel (Falcons 2013) as the starting pitchers for their country, while Axel Poesmans (Cavaliers 2014) was the starting catcher for Belgium.\nIn December 2014, CBLE announced it added venues in Vienna, Prague and Amsterdam to launch its East Division expansion in 2015, while London, Sant Boi Barcelona and La Rochelle will form the West Division. CBLE's hometown Oosterhout (NLD) will be the host of the EAST vs. WEST All Star game, the CBLE Championship Series playoffs and the Championship Game.\nThis is a list of the winningest CBLE franchise teams as measured in both total wins and winning percentage. The Sant Boi Barcelona Falcons lead all other teams with 33 wins. The remaining all-time win leaders in CBLE are the La Rochelle Admirals (29 wins), Praha Dragons (14), Amsterdam Bombers (13), Vienna Emperors (13), and London Cavaliers (11), respectively. In winning percentage, the all-time leaders in the CBLE are the Sant Boi Barcelona Falcons (.635), La Rochelle Admirals (.596), Vienna Emperors (.481), Praha Dragons (.467), Amsterdam Bombers (.406), and London Cavaliers (.344), respectively."

He is also a former college football All-American defensive back who played for coach Bear Bryant at the University of Alabama.\nEarly years.\nAfter graduating from Banks High School in Birmingham, Alabama, Johns enrolled at the University of Alabama. Playing quarterback in high school, during his freshman year he moved to defensive back. For the Crimson Tide, Johns was a member of the 1965 national championship team, was selected All-SEC three times (1965–1967) and All-America twice (1966–1967). He was selected in the 12th Round of the 1968 NFL Draft by the Kansas City Chiefs, but elected to pursue a coaching career instead. As recognition for his career at Alabama, Johns was elected to the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 2010.\nCoaching career.\nEarly in his career, Johns coach at both McAdory and E.B. Erwin High School where he compiled an overall record of 52 wins and 30 losses (52–30) during his eight-year tenure as a high school head coach. From Erwin, Johns entered the college coaching ranks in 1972 where he coached defensive backs at Florence State University now UNA. Between 1984 and 1996 he coached at Valdosta State, Florida State, Chattanooga, Eastern Kentucky, South Carolina and West Alabama. After serving one season as defensive coordinator at West Alabama, in December 1996 he was promoted to the head coach position after the resignation of Todd Stroud. Prior to entering the 2000 season with the Tigers, Johns announced he would resign from his position effective at the end of the season. For his career at West Alabama, Johns compiled a record of 11 wins and 31 losses (11–31)."

        "title": "Tennis racket theorem",
        "text": "The tennis racket theorem or intermediate axis theorem, is a kinetic phenomenon of classical mechanics which describes the movement of a rigid body with three distinct principal moments of inertia. It has also dubbed the Dzhanibekov effect, after Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Dzhanibekov, who noticed one of the theorem's logical consequences whilst in space in 1985. Formally the effect had been known for at least 150 years, having been described by Louis Poinsot in 1834.\nThe theorem describes the following effect: rotation of an object around its first and third principal axes is stable, whereas rotation around its second principal axis (or intermediate axis) is not.\nThis can be demonstrated by the following experiment: hold a tennis racket at its handle, with its face being horizontal, and throw it in the air such that it performs a full rotation around its horizontal axis perpendicular to the handle (ê2 in the diagram, ê1 in the video), and then catch the handle. In almost all cases, during that rotation the face will also have completed a half rotation, so that the other face is now up. By contrast, it is easy to throw the racket so that it will rotate around the handle axis (ê1 in the diagram) without accompanying half-rotation around another axis; it is also possible to make it rotate around the vertical axis perpendicular to the handle (ê3 in the diagram) without any accompanying half-rotation.\nThe experiment can be performed with any object that has three different moments of inertia, for instance with a book, remote control, or smartphone. The effect occurs whenever the axis of rotation differs only slightly from the object's second principal axis; air resistance or gravity are not necessary.\nTheory.\nThe tennis racket theorem can be qualitatively analysed with the help of Euler's equations.\nUnder torque–free conditions, they take the following form:\nformula_1\nHere formula_2 denote the object's principal moments of inertia, and we assume formula_3. The angular velocities around the object's three principal axes are formula_4 and their time derivatives are denoted by formula_5.\nStable rotation around the first and third principal axis.\nConsider the situation when the object is rotating around axis with moment of inertia formula_6. To determine the nature of equilibrium, assume small initial angular velocities along the other two axes. As a result, according to equation (1), formula_7 is very small. Therefore, the time dependence of formula_8 may be neglected.\nNow, differentiating equation (2) and substituting formula_9 from equation (3),\nformula_10\nbecause formula_11 and formula_12.\nNote that formula_13 is being opposed and so rotation around this axis is stable for the object.\nSimilar reasoning gives that rotation around axis with moment of inertia formula_14 is also stable.\nUnstable rotation around the second principal axis.\nNow apply the same analysis to axis with moment of inertia formula_15 This time formula_16 is very small. Therefore, the time dependence of formula_17 may be neglected.\nNow, differentiating equation (1) and substituting formula_9 from equation (3),\nformula_19\nNote that formula_20 is \"not\" opposed (and therefore will grow) and so rotation around the second axis is \"unstable\". Therefore, even a small disturbance, in the form of a very small initial value of formula_20 or formula_22, causes the object to 'flip'.\nMatrix analysis.\nIf the object is mostly rotating along its third axis, so formula_23, we can assume formula_22 does not vary much, and write the equations of motion as a matrix equation:formula_25which has zero trace and positive determinant, implying the motion of formula_26 is a stable rotation around the origin—a neutral equilibrium point. Similarly, the point formula_27 is a neutral equilibrium point, but formula_28 is a saddle point.\nGeometric analysis.\nDuring motion, both the energy and angular momentum-squared are conserved, thus we have two conserved quantities:formula_29and so for any initial condition formula_30, the trajectory of formula_31 must stay on the intersection curve between two ellipsoids defined by formula_32This is shown on the animation to the left.\nBy inspecting Euler's equations, we see that formula_33 implies that two components of formula_31 are zero—that is, the object is exactly spinning around one of the principal axes. In all other situations, formula_31 must remain in motion.\nBy Euler's equations, if formula_31 is a solution, then so is formula_37 for any constant formula_38. In particular, the motion of the body in free space (obtained by integrating formula_39) is \"exactly the same\", just completed faster by a ratio of formula_40.\nConsequently, we can analyze the geometry of motion with a fixed value of formula_41, and vary formula_30 on the fixed ellipsoid of constant squared angular momentum. As formula_30 varies, the value of formula_44 also varies—thus giving us a varying ellipsoid of constant energy. This is shown in the animation as a fixed orange ellipsoid and increasing blue ellipsoid.\nFor concreteness, consider formula_45, then the angular momentum ellipsoid's major axes are in ratios of formula_46, and the energy ellipsoid's major axes are in ratios of formula_47. Thus the angular momentum ellipsoid is both flatter and sharper, as visible in the animation. In general, the angular momentum ellipsoid is always more \"exaggerated\" than the energy ellipsoid.\nNow inscribe on a fixed ellipsoid of formula_41 its intersection curves with the ellipsoid of formula_44, as formula_44 increases from zero to infinity. We can see that the curves evolve as follows:\nThe tennis racket effect occurs when formula_30 is very close to a saddle point. The body would linger near the saddle point, then rapidly move to the other saddle point, near formula_65, linger again for a long time, and so on. The motion repeats with period formula_66.\nThe above analysis is all done in the perspective of an observer which is rotating with the body. An observer watching the body's motion in free space would see its angular momentum vector formula_67 conserved, while both its angular velocity vector formula_68 and its moment of inertia formula_69 undergoing complicated motions in space. At the beginning, the observer would see both formula_70 mostly aligned with the second major axis of formula_71. After a while, the body performs a complicated motion and ends up with formula_72, and again both formula_73 are mostly aligned with the second major axis of formula_74.\nConsequently, there are two possibilities: either the rigid body's second major axis is in the same direction, or it has reversed direction. If it is still in the same direction, then formula_75 viewed in the rigid body's reference frame are also mostly in the same direction. However, we have just seen that formula_30 and formula_65 are near opposite saddle points formula_56. Contradiction.\nQualitatively, then, this is what an observer watching in free space would observe:\nThis can be easily seen in the video demonstration in microgravity.\nWith dissipation.\nWhen the body is not exactly rigid, but can flex and bend or contain liquid that sloshes around, it can dissipate energy through its internal degrees of freedom. In this case, the body still has constant angular momentum, but its energy would decrease, until it reaches the minimal point. As analyzed geometrically above, this happens when the body's angular velocity is exactly aligned with its axis of maximal moment of inertia.\nThis happened to Explorer 1, the first satellite launched by the United States in 1958. The elongated body of the spacecraft had been designed to spin about its long (least-inertia) axis but refused to do so, and instead started precessing due to energy dissipation from flexible structural elements.\nIn general, celestial bodies large or small would converge to a constant rotation around its axis of maximal moment of inertia. Whenever a celestial body is found in a complex rotational state, it is either due to a recent impact or tidal interaction, or is a fragment of a recently disrupted progenitor."

        "title": "London Scottish Golf Club",
        "text": "London Scottish Golf Club near the windmill on Wimbledon Common is the third oldest golf club in England.\nIt was founded in 1865 by members of the London Scottish Volunteer Rifles (later the London Scottish regiment), who were stationed on the common. Some of the holes were laid out roughly along the lines of rifle ranges. There is evidence to suggest that golf was played on the course for at least two years before the club's formal foundation, which would make London Scottish the longest continually played upon golf course in England.\nOriginally consisting of seven holes, it was redesigned as an 18-hole course by the club professional Tom Dunn in 1871, thereby becoming only the fifth golf course in the world – and the first in England – to have 18 holes. The redesign came in the same year that the Wimbledon and Putney Commons Act took the common away from the ownership of the 5th Earl Spencer and into public hands. The land over which the course was laid out is heath and woodland.\nThe London Scottish course hosted the first ever Oxford v Cambridge University golf match in 1878, and the annual fixture was played there for almost two decades until 1896, after which it moved to Royal St Georges in Sandwich.\nIn 1881 a split within the club between military and civilian members, including Laidlaw Purves, led to the creation by the civilians of what is now Royal Wimbledon Golf Club. The two clubs shared the course until 1907, when Royal Wimbledon members built their own new course just off the common. The following year Wimbledon Common Golf Club was founded, and began to share the old course on the common with London Scottish. That arrangement has continued to the present day. Although the clubs are entirely separate, with their own clubhouses and different starting points, they work together and jointly employ the course green-keeping staff.\nNotable members of London Scottish Golf Club have included Arthur Balfour, British prime minister from 1902 to 1905, and Willie Dunn, the first unofficial champion of America in 1894 and runner-up in the first US Open of 1895. George Duncan, Open Champion at Deal in 1920 and victorious captain of the 1929 British Ryder Cup team, was also a member. In 2015, the club's 150th anniversary year, Colin Montgomerie was captain.\nThe club has had a strong tradition of professionals who have been renowned golf club makers, including John Butchart, Hugh Logan, David Wilson, Spen Attwood and, in the more modern era, Matthew Barr. The former European Tour pro Steve Barr, Matthew's brother, was professional at the club from 1992 to late 2021, and Matthew returned to the club on Steve's retirement.\nUnusually, due to local byelaws, all golfers playing on the London Scottish course must wear a pillar box red upper garment. Because of its age and its positioning on a Site of Special Scientific Interest, the course is one of the few in the world to have no sand bunkers. Its wood-panelled clubhouse, which was built in 1897 and is a listed building, is a rare remaining example of a purpose-built Victorian golf pavilion.\nThe fictional Wombles of Wimbledon Common, created by the British children's author Elisabeth Beresford, often played golf on the London Scottish course. In \"The Wombles to the Rescue\" (first published in 1974) Tomsk, the most accomplished of the golfing Wombles, is reported to have once played the course in level par."

Its dimensions were 320 feet (left field), 365 feet (center field) and 320 feet (right field).\nMiller Field was demolished on September 19, 1955, after the dissolution of the KITTY League. James C. Ellis, who bought the property, stated that the parcel of land was too valuable to be a baseball park."

        "text": "The 2016 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 87th edition of the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. The game was hosted by the San Diego Padres and was played at Petco Park on July 12, 2016. It was televised nationally on Fox. The American League All-Stars defeated the National League All-Stars by a score of 4–2 to win home field advantage for the 2016 World Series (which went to the Cleveland Indians). This was also the last time home-field advantage for the World Series was determined by the outcome of the All-Star Game.\nThe host city was announced on January 15, 2015, by then-Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig. This was the third time the city of San Diego hosted the All-Star Game and the first time since 1992.\nEric Hosmer, an infielder for the Kansas City Royals, was named the 2016 All-Star Game Most Valuable Player.\nHost selection.\nThe Baltimore Orioles were also in line for hosting the game. Former Commissioner Bud Selig said that Baltimore was a prime candidate to host the event, but the Padres ended up with the game. Petco Park opened in 2004 and hosted the 2006 World Baseball Classic championship round. Because National League parks had been selected to host four straight games from 2015–2018, skipping an American League park in 2016 and 2018 in the traditional alternating system, the AL team was designated as the home team.\nFan balloting.\nStarters.\nBalloting for the 2016 All-Star Game starters began online April 24 and ended on June 30. The top vote-getters at each position (including the designated hitter for the American League) and the top three among outfielders, were named the starters for their respective leagues. The results were announced on July 5. Salvador Pérez was the leading vote-getter with 4,965,838 votes.\nFinal roster spot.\nAfter the rosters are finalized, a second ballot of five players per league was created for the All-Star Final Vote to determine the 34th and final player of each roster. The online balloting was conducted from July 5 through July 8. The winners of the All-Star Final Vote were Michael Saunders of the American League's Toronto Blue Jays and Brandon Belt of the National League's San Francisco Giants.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nGame summary.\nThe NL got off to a quick start against Chris Sale when Kris Bryant homered in the top of the first. In the bottom of the second inning, the AL got to Johnny Cueto when Eric Hosmer homered to left to tie the game. Two batters later, Salvador Pérez hit a two-run shot to give the AL a 3–1 lead.\nIn the bottom of the third, after walking, David Ortiz was replaced by Edwin Encarnación and left the field to a standing ovation in his final all-star game. The AL would tack on another run in this inning when Hosmer hit an RBI single off José Fernández, driving in Encarnacion to give the AL a 4–1 lead. The NL shrunk the lead with an RBI single by Marcell Ozuna in the top of the fourth off Aaron Sanchez. However, this would be all the runs scored in the game, as the National League stranded 10 baserunners throughout the game.\nIn the top of the eighth, the NL loaded the bases, but could not capitalize when Aledmys Díaz struck out looking against Will Harris to end the frame. In the ninth, Zach Britton got Nolan Arenado to ground into a double play to secure the 4–2 victory for the American League.\nControversies.\nPrior to the game, The Tenors performed the Canadian national anthem, \"O Canada\". As in many previous years, the performance of the Canadian anthem was replaced in the Fox broadcast in the United States with commercial break of the Fox broadcast prior to the singing of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" in a performance by Rachel Platten, but it was carried on ESPN Radio in the U.S. and Sportsnet in Canada.\nDuring a solo, group member Remigio Pereira altered the lyrics to \"O Canada\" to criticize the Black Lives Matter movement, singing \"We're all brothers and sisters, all lives matter to the great\", and holding up a sign on cardboard reading \"ALL LIVES MATTER\". The English lyric normally sung at that point is \"With glowing hearts we see thee rise, the True North strong and free;\" however the remainder of the lyrics sung were in keeping with the official bilingual (English-French) version. Later that evening, Pereira, a co-founder of the group, was denounced by the group as a \"lone wolf\", leading to an announcement that he would not be performing with The Tenors until further notice, and eventually removed permanently from the group."

        "title": "Iowa Big Four men's college basketball",
        "text": "The Hy-Vee Classic consisted of games between Iowa's four NCAA Division I men's basketball teams: Iowa, Iowa State, Northern Iowa, and Drake. For 2012–2018, the rivalry consisted of a one-day two game event at Wells Fargo Arena each December, originally called the Big Four Classic but now known as the Hy-Vee Classic, Iowa and Iowa State playing each other in an ongoing-home and home series, and Drake and Northern Iowa playing each other regularly as members of the Missouri Valley Conference. Grinnell College was previously considered a part of the Big Four prior to their demotion to NCAA Division III athletics when they were members of the MVIAA and Missouri Valley Conference.\nHistory.\nFor decades, Iowa State (of the Big 12 Conference) and Iowa (of the Big Ten Conference) had home-and-home series with in-state rivals Drake and UNI, with Iowa visiting Drake in even-numbered years and Northern Iowa in odd-numbered years (with the corresponding return trips to Iowa in the opposite years) and Iowa State visiting Northern Iowa in even-numbered years and Drake in odd-numbered years. Drake and Iowa State, in particular, played in 104 of 105 seasons.\nIn the 2000s, Iowa State, wanting to gain a greater presence in the Des Moines area, offered and played multiple games at Wells Fargo Arena with various teams. When they offered Drake the opportunity to move their rivalry to Wells Fargo Arena, Drake declined. Iowa and Iowa State also offered Drake and UNI money to play only in Iowa City/Ames but both schools declined.\nDuring the 2010/2011 seasons, Iowa and Iowa State began to feel pressure from losing to Northern Iowa and Drake in their non-conference schedule and to allow for more games against Power 5 conference in hopes of building a strong non-conference schedule for consideration for at-large bids for future NCAA Tournaments. Drake and Northern Iowa did not want to lose the match-ups. A neutral site concept was seen as the best for everyone involved and the Big Four Classic was born.\nHy-Vee signed on as the sponsor of the event. The initial contract ran from 2012–2015. It was later extended to 2017. As part of the 2019 extension, the event was renamed the Hy-Vee Classic.\nHy-Vee Classic.\nThe event was held on the third Saturday of December. In 2013 the event was moved to the first Saturday of December, but attendance from students preparing for finals dropped considerably so the event was moved back to the third Saturday, although all four universities host December Commencement exercises on the day.\nThe event consists of two games played back to back. Initially, in even numbered years, Iowa played Northern Iowa and Drake played Iowa State. In odd numbered years, Iowa played Drake and Northern Iowa played Iowa State. The even-odd rotation was switched as part of the 2016–2019 extension. The schools also rotate hosting duties in this order: Iowa, Drake, Iowa State, Northern Iowa.\nWhich game is first/second and at what times is largely determined by television. Initially there was hope for both games making it to national television audiences, however this has largely been unsuccessful to date due to college football bowl games and other established basketball events on the same day nationally. The Big Ten &amp; Big 12 have rights to the games Iowa and Iowa State respectively are played in. If both conference TV partners pass on the game, ESPN can televise through the Missouri Valley Conference's deal with the network. Otherwise, the games will air locally on Mediacom 22. In 2015, the Iowa State-Northern Iowa game broadcast on ESPNU (aided by both teams being ranked) and the Drake-Iowa game was broadcast on ESPN3 marking the first national television broadcast from the event.\nFinancially, the four schools split revenue 25–25–25–25. This has resulted in Drake and UNI making a much larger profit than they did, although it does come at the expense of the loss of a major home game each year. The event did not sell out in its first year, but has each year since.\nIn addition to the loss of on-campus home games against in-state rivals, Drake and Northern Iowa play either Iowa or Iowa State, but not both in the same season. As Drake and Northern Iowa cannot play each other in the classic due to their Missouri Valley Conference affiliations, there is no way to formally determine an official champion between the four schools in a tournament-style format.\nFuture match-ups.\nIowa announced on June 14, 2018 that it was exercising its contractual right to leave the Hy-Vee Classic after the 2018 season, leaving the future of the Hy-Vee Classic in doubt. While Iowa and Iowa State have not ruled out further participation, comments by both schools indicate that they would prefer to not play games in Des Moines and would rather play home games at each school's respective home arena."

It was first issued in 1888 and it had reached its 48th edition by 1939 (after omitting the First World War years). By that time it was generally including over 200 pages together with a small number of photographs. As well as containing test match and county championship records, this particular cricket annual differed from a number of similar publications by the depth of its coverage of certain minor leagues — especially those in the north of England (close to its home base) and also in Scotland.\nAfter World War II it reappeared as the Athletic News Cricket and Golf Annual (1946), then subsequently – from its 50th year – as the Sunday Chronicle Cricket and Golf Annual (1947-1954), before one last year as the Sunday Chronicle Cricket Annual (1955). Like its companion volume the Athletic News Football Annual it was for many years edited by ‘Tityrus’ (J A H Catton) and afterwards by Ivan Sharpe.\nDetails.\nEditions produced since 1935:-\nNote: The 1947-1955 editions were sub-titled 'incorporating the Athletic News Cricket Annual'.

        "text": "A total of six bids were initially submitted for the 2022 Winter Olympics. Four of the bids were subsequently withdrawn by 1 October 2014, citing either the high costs of hosting the Games or the lack of local support, leaving Almaty, Kazakhstan and Beijing, China as the only two remaining candidate cities. Beijing was then elected as the host city at the 128th IOC Session in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on 31 July 2015.\nBidding calendar.\nOn 3 October 2012, the IOC announced in a letter to the NOCs the bidding calendar for the 2022 Winter Olympics:\nCandidate cities venues list.\nNote that the selected candidate cities have slightly changed venues plan in the final proposal to the IOC. Almaty moved technical alpine skiing events from Shymbulak to Tau, and completely removed both Kok Zhaylau and Ak-Bulak ski resorts, previously proposed for snowboarding and freestyle skiing events. Beijing dropped both Taiwu and Wanlong ski resorts, and proposed hosting snowboarding and freestyle skiing events in the two venues (A and B) in Genting Snow Park.\nCandidate cities comparison.\nAll data comes from applicant cities' bid books. Candidate cities' public support data has been updated.\nEvaluation of the applicant cities.\nEach cell of the table provides a minimum and a maximum figure obtained by the applicant city on the specific criteria. These figures are to be compared to a benchmark which has been set at 6.\nCandidate cities overview.\nOn 15 November 2013, the IOC announced the list of the six applicant cities. On 7 July 2014, the IOC announced that there were three remaining applicant cities that would move on to the candidate phase; these were Almaty, Beijing and Oslo.\nOn 1 October 2014, Oslo withdrew its application after one of the country's governing political parties Høyre decided not to support the application. The remaining two candidate cities were therefore Almaty and Beijing.\nBoth of the candidate cities suggested hosting the Games between February 4–20, 2022. The Paralympics will be held from March 4–13. While another city suggested hosting the Games between February 11–27, 2022. The Paralympics will be held from March 11–20.\nAlmaty.\nSince 2011, the National Olympic Committee of the Republic of Kazakhstan has been considering a bid for the 2022 games in Almaty, the former longtime capital city and still the largest city and financial centre of the country. Kazakhstan hosted the 2011 Asian Winter Games. Almaty will host 2017 Winter Universiade. The current Kazakh capital Astana considered to joint bid with Almaty but the idea was later declined. On 17 August 2013, Almaty announced they were bidding for the 2022 Games. Under the slogan \"Keeping it Real\", Almaty has emphasized her traditional winter setting with tall mountains and plenty of natural snow coverage as well as compactness — most venues are within half an hour's travel through Alpine scenery.\nPresenting Kazakhstan's bid at the final event in Kuala Lumpur, Prime Minister of Kazakhstan Karim Massimov made a powerful speech with a key message that Almaty was \"not a risk choice for 2022\", but \"a golden opportunity to prove that smaller advancing nations can successfully host the winter games\". He called to the IOC core values saying that letting Almaty host the Games was \"a golden opportunity to showcase the real long-term power of Olympic legacy for a region that has never hosted the Games\".\nIn the final voting Almaty lost to Beijing by only 4 votes.\nBeijing.\nOn 5 November 2013, the Chinese Olympic Committee announced that it would submit a bid for Beijing to host the 2022 Winter Olympics. Beijing (where the indoor ice sports and the ceremonies would take place), was the host city of the 2008 Summer Olympics. Zhangjiakou would host the outdoor snow events.\nBefore the final voting in Kuala Lumpur Beijing's bid was presented by Yang Lan, a renowned former CCTV host, who said sports and fitness were becoming a new fashion trend in China. In her speech she focused on China's economy and its ability to support every commitment it made \"protecting long time financial viability and the reputation of the Games\".\nOslo.\nOn 6 November 2013, the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports announced that Oslo would be submitted as the Norwegian candidate for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games. Oslo last hosted the 1952 Winter Olympics, and Norway last hosted the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer. On 1 October 2014 the Conservative Party decided that they would not support a bid for the games citing costs and lack of public support. A vast number of polls were conducted, and since April 2014 support had varied between 24% and 37%. The days leading up to the deliberation in the Conservative Party had consisted of a series of negative developments for the bid. Those negative developments included the Centre Party saying \"no\" through a grass root vote, a poll showing that even within the Norwegian Confederation of Sports the majority of members opposed the bid, an external revision which clarified that the newly suggested cheaper budget was unrealistic and public scrutiny on IOC´s 7000 pages of demands.\nNorway rejected the Olympic committee's application for government funding to hold the event in Norway after the private organization IOC made a large number of demands which caused a scandal in Norway. The demands notably included \"diva-like demands for luxury treatment\" for the IOC members themselves, such as special lanes on all roads only to be used by IOC members, a cocktail reception at the Royal Palace with drinks paid for by the royal family, car and drivers for all IOC members, adjusted traffic lights, free cell phones, seasonal fruits, and all \"OL-shaped\" and \"Olympic Appearance” furniture. The IOC also demanded \"control over all advertising space throughout Oslo during the Games, to be used exclusively by official sponsors.\" Several commentators pointed out that such demands were unheard of in a western democracy; \"Slate\" described the IOC as a \"notoriously ridiculous organization run by grifters and hereditary aristocrats.\"\nApplicant cities overview.\nOn 7 November 2013, the Polish Olympic Committee announced they submitted a bid to the IOC for the 2022 Winter Olympics, together with Zakopane, Poland, and Jasná, a village in central Slovakia, near the Polish border. If the bid had been successful, it would have been the first time either Poland or Slovakia hosted the Olympics. Zakopane previously bid to host the 2006 Winter Olympics but failed to become a candidate. Kraków's bid was submitted to a local referendum held on 25 May 2014, which had a negative result. After that Kraków discontinued the application on 26 May 2014.\nThe National Olympic Committee of Ukraine officially submitted a bid for Lviv to host the 2022 Winter Olympic Games on 5 November 2013. On 30 June 2014, however, the IOC announced that Lviv would \"turn its attention to an Olympic bid for 2026, and not continue with its application for 2022. The decision comes as a result of the 2013–2015 Ukrainian crisis\" which seriously influences Lviv and the country.\nOn 11 November 2013, the Swedish Olympic Committee announced that it had submitted a bid, but on 17 January 2014, Stockholm dropped the bid due to lack of political support. Åre, about from Stockholm, was scheduled to host the alpine skiing events. Stockholm previously hosted the 1912 Summer Olympics and hosted equestrian events of the 1956 Summer Olympics, but this was the first time the Swedish capital had bid for the Winter Olympics. Had it won, it would have been the first city to host both the Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics, a distinction that ultimately went to Beijing.\nVoting results for the 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics.\nBeijing was selected as host city of the 2022 Winter Olympics and Winter Paralympics after beating Almaty by just four votes. Beijing received one more vote than the 43 needed for majority."
