        "text": "The South Africa national cricket team toured the West Indies in April 1992. The tour marked the first-ever official Test and One Day International matches between the two teams. It was also South Africa's first Test match since their reintroduction to the sport after being suspended in 1970 due to the apartheid regime, and their first Test against a non-white team.\nThe tour consisted of three One-day Internationals and one Test match against the West Indies. All four matches were won by the West Indies.\nMatch details.\nTest Match.\nThe Test match was South Africa's first since their return to international cricket, and so 10 players were making their Test match debuts (Kepler Wessels had previously played for Australia). For the West Indies, 3 players made their debuts — Jimmy Adams, David Williams and Kenny Benjamin. The selection of Benjamin in particular had been a contentious issue. The Barbados crowd had expected Anderson Cummins, a Barbadian and a local favourite, to make his debut in this match in front of his home fans. However, the West Indian selectors opted for Benjamin instead. As a result, many fans chose to boycott the match in protest.\nSouth Africa won the toss and chose to bowl first. The West Indies had reached 219/3, but collapsed to 262 all out. Notable contributions came from Keith Arthurton (59), Desmond Haynes (58) and Richie Richardson (44), and Richard Snell picked up 4 wickets for South Africa.\nSouth Africa batted throughout the whole of the second day and into the third, racking up a score of 345 all out. A century from Andrew Hudson (163) formed the backbone of the innings with some support from Kepler Wessels (59). Debutant Jimmy Adams used his part-time spin bowling to pick up 4 wickets.\nIn their second innings, the West Indies scored 283 all out with help from Brian Lara (64) and Jimmy Adams (79*). Allan Donald and Richard Snell took 4 wickets each. This left South Africa requiring 201 runs for victory.\nAfter the loss of two early wickets to Curtly Ambrose, half-centuries from Kepler Wessels (74) and Peter Kirsten (52) steadied the South African innings. However, after Wessels' dismissal to Courtney Walsh, South Africa collapsed from 123/2 to 148 all out as Ambrose (6 wickets) and Walsh (4 wickets) demolished the rest of the batting line-up. Four players were out for ducks, and after Wessels and Kirsten, the next highest score was only 4.\nCurtly Ambrose and Andrew Hudson were jointly named Men of the Match — Ambrose for his match-winning spell of 6/34 and Hudson for his 163."

Their absence was compounded by painfully slow pitches, particularly at Bridgetown, and Australia played 5 bowlers in all four Tests.\nThe Test series would culminate during the final test at St John's, where there would be a vicious altercation between Glenn McGrath and Ramnaresh Sarwan, as well as a record run chase by the struggling West Indies side which remained their most recent test match win against Australia till 2024.\nWhilst the West Indies saved face in the last Test and three ODI matches, Australia were clearly the superior team.\nTour background.\nIn early 2003, Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne was banned from cricket by the Australian Cricket Board drugs panel. In a drug test, Warne was found to be positive for hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride, a form of diuretic. His year long ban saw Warne miss the 2003 Cricket World Cup as well as Australia's tour of the West Indies. Warne has denied taking performance-enhancing drugs and claimed that the substance was a fluid tablet from his mother.\nFast bowler Glenn McGrath would be granted leave from the tour early on and would return home to Australia to support his wife Jane, who had recently been diagnosed with metastatic disease in her hip.\nTour match.\nThe university would win the toss in this tour match and elect to bat first. A young Chris Gayle would score a century, assisted by Jason Haynes, who would score a half century, but would be the only real resistance against the Australians. Stuart MacGill would take five wickets for the Australians, giving them momentum going into their innings, where Langer and Maher would start the innings with a 202 run partnership. The Aussies would declare with 258 runs on the board. A poor second innings would follow for the Chancellor's XI, with them only managing to set Australia a target of 95 runs. MacGill you grab another five wicket haul giving him 10 wickets for the match and man of the match honours as the Aussies would shuffle their line up to easily take the victory.\nTest series.\nThe teams played a four-match Test series, competing for the Frank Worrell Trophy, named after the first black captain of the West Indies. The trophy was first contested during 1960/61 in Australia, with the home nation being victorious.\n1st Test.\nWest Indies captain Brian Lara won the toss and chose to bat first on a flat pitch. West Indies scored 237, with a century by Shivnarine Chanderpaul, but Australia, led by centuries from both Justin Langer and Ricky Ponting scored 489 in reply. West Indies replied with centuries from Ganga and Lara in the second innings, but left Australia a small target of 147, which was chased with the loss of only one wicket. Due to the flat nature of the pitch, Australia would benefit by using the unorthodox strategy of playing five bowlers, which proved to be a major factor in their victory. Justin Langer would be named man of the match, top scoring in both innings for the Australians.\n2nd Test.\nAustralia would win the toss and elect to bat first. The decision was criticised after the early dismissal of the Aussie openers, but Ponting and Lehmann would steady the ship with a 335 run partnership. The West Indian captain would hit another century, to get the West Indies to 408. In the Australian second innings Mathew Hayden would stand up with a century just before Waugh's declaration. On the last day the West Indies would fall 118 runs short of the 407 run target, giving Australia a 2–0 lead in the series.\n3rd Test.\nAfter winning the toss the West Indies made the controversial decision of electing to field first. This Test would be controlled by Shane Warne's replacement, Stuart MacGill who took 4 and 5 wickets in each innings respectively. This test would mark the return of Glen McGrath from time with his wife. Australia's current and incumbent captains Waugh and Ponting would score centuries in the first innings, with Australia declaring for 609 runs. The future of Australian cricket was clear, but the West Indies had a leadership crisis going on. West Indies would struggle, only scoring 328 then being forced to follow on, where they would only be able to set Australia a target of 8, which was easily chased, clenching the series for the Australians, whilst also moving them to the top of the ICC Test Standings, making them the best test nation in the world.\n4th Test.\nThe toss was won by Waugh who elected to bat. Ponting, the player of the series and Wisden ‘Leading Player of the Year’ would miss the test due to illness and be replaced by Martin Love, but Australia still struggled with not a single batsman passing 50. However, Jermaine Lawson stood tall for the West Indies, taking seven wickets in the first innings, including both Aussie openers. Lara top scored for the West Indies in their first innings, equalling them with Australia after the first innings at 240. In the 2nd innings both Aussie openers would past the century mark, with the first wicket falling for 242, more than both teams first innings total. They went on the set the Caribbean a record chase of 418.\nThey struggled early, being 74/3, but Sarwan and Chanderpaul would both stand up for the nation with centuries. Controversy would come out of this innings, due to a sledging incident between McGrath and Sarwan. McGrath asked Sarwan, “What does Brian Lara’s d*** taste like?”, to which the West Indian replied, “I don’t know, ask your wife”. This aggravated McGrath, who had missed the first two tests in the series due to his wife's cancer. The exchange culminated with McGrath saying “If you ever fucking mention my wife again I’ll fucking rip your fucking throat out!”. The verbal barrage would not impact the West Indies as they set the record for the highest successful 4th innings run chase in test cricket and won the match, to bring the series to 3-1 Australia.\nODI series.\nThe teams played a seven match One Day International series following the conclusion of the Test series.\n1st ODI.\nThe West Indies won the toss and chose to field first. Jason Gillespie would be rested and Ricky Ponting would return from his illness to captain the Australian's, top scoring with 59. Australia would finish 270/5 with high strike rate innings from Bevan and Harvey. The West Indies would struggle in their chase with no batsman passing 50. During their innings rain would stop play and meant a revised target would be set of 208, which would need to be scored in 37 overs, which the West Indies fell 3 short of to give Australia an early lead in the series. Continuing their record-breaking winning streak in ODI's.\n2nd ODI.\nThe West Indies would again win the toss but choose to bat first. The Caribbean nations would struggle with the bat, with not a single batsman passing 50 and them being all out for 163. Glen McGrath would be the pick of the bowlers taking 4 wickets in his 10 overs. It was an easy chase for the Australian's with Ponting and Hayden scoring half centuries. Glen McGrath would receive man of the match honours and Australia would go up 2–0 in the series.\n3rd ODI.\nThe West Indies would continue their domination of the coin toss, electing to field first. The Australian's would struggle early, but allrounder Andrew Symonds and future captain Michael Clarke would each score 75 in a 95 run partnership to help Australia to 258. The West Indies would continue their struggles with the bat, with no batsmen going on to get big scores, although many got starts. Jason Gillespie would be the pick of the Aussie bowlers and Michael Clarke would be man of the match as Australia went one win away from leading the series.\n4th ODI.\nAustralia would finally win the ever important toss and choose to bat first. Adam Gilchrist would be the pick of the Australian players with an 84 and Michael Clarke would contribute with 55. Vasbert Drakes would pick up 2 wickets for the West Indies to keep them in the match. The team in maroon would need 287 in the 50 overs. future captain Chris Gayle fought hard with an 84, but the rest of his side would collapse, with them only managing 219. The wickets would be spread amongst the aussie bowlers with Ponting and Symonds getting runouts to help Australia to a series victory and Adam Gilchrist would be named man of the match.\n5th ODI.\nThe West Indies again won the toss and elected to bat first. Hinds and Lara put on a 178 run partnership to guide the West Indies to a 290 run total. Brett Lee was the pick of the bowlers taking 3 wickets. Only Andrew Symonds would stand up for Australia with 77, Mervyn Dillon took 3 wickets for the Caribbean, leading them to a victory by 39 runs. In this match David Bernard would debut and Brian Lara will be named man of the match.\n6th ODI.\nAustralia won the toss and elected to bat. An opening stand of 90 would help them to 252, but they lost constant wickets. Chris Gayle would be the pick of the bowlers taking 3 wickets and then scoring 18 runs. Wavell Hinds would be named player of the match after his century, The West Indies would win with 8 balls to spare and would bring the series to 4-2 going into the final match of the tour.\n7th ODI.\nAustralia would win the toss in the final match of the tour and elected to bat first. Darren Lehmann would make an impact scoring a century before being dismissed by Chris Gayle. Gayle would take a 5 wicket haul, then score 60 in a 116 run partnership with Hinds who scored a century. It was a tough decision for man of the match, but it would be awarded to Gayle, but Hinds would be acknowledged with the player of the series award, after criticism of underperforming in the recent World Cup, and helped the West Indies bring the series up to a respectable 4–3."

        "text": "The sixth team of English cricketers toured the West Indies in the 1910–11 season. For the first time the MCC organised the tour. The team was captained by AWF Somerset and played a total of 12 matches, of which 11 are regarded as first-class, between February and April 1911.\nThe team.\nA party of 11 was taken:\nAPFC Somerset was the son of AWF Somerset, who had toured the West Indies with Lord Brackley's team six years earlier. DCF Burton and DSG Burton were cousins.\nAC Johnston, LHW Troughton and GJ Thompson all withdrew from the published side and only 11 players were eventually taken on the tour. The team was thought to be quite weak but performed better than expected. The three professionals (Young, Brown and Hearne) were all good players although Brown and Hearne were inexperienced at this time. Sydney Smith, although a native of Trinidad, was playing county cricket and Tom Whittington was a regular for Glamorgan in the Minor Counties Championship. An inevitable constraint was that, with only 11 players touring, there were occasions when local players had to be used to complete the team.\nThe tour.\nThe team left England on the \"RMSP Clyde\" on 18 January 1911.\nMatches played were:\nOf the 11 first-class matches, 3 were won, 4 lost, 3 drawn and 1 tied. The minor match was won. Unlike previous tours there were no matches in any of the smaller islands.\nStarting in Barbados, the tourists lost the first two matches heavily but the match against a West Indies XI was won. The West Indies XI was without any Trinidad players because of quarantine restrictions.\nIn British Guiana the tourists won well with some good batting by Whittington and Holloway and they then beat the West Indian side. A second match against the West Indies was organised but when Archer was dropped the two other Barbados players refused to play.\nThe first match in Trinidad was played immediately after the tourists had got off the boat and they lost by an innings. The second match was closer although still won by Trinidad.\nAfter the long trip to Jamaica the tourists played four matches there. Rain ruined the first two matches and after a win against Port Antonio the final match ended in a tie.\nSydney Smith was the leading player for the tourists being top of the bowling averages and second in the batting averages. Whittington and Holloway also batted well despite having only played one first class match between them before the tour started. Hearne was a success with the ball but Brown and Young were something of a disappointment. Despite being in his mid-50s the captain also turned out to be a useful bowler.\nAverages.\nThe following averages are in the 11 first class matches:\nBatting.\nGrell, Heath, Liddlelow and Simpson were local players."

        "text": "The seventh team of English cricketers toured the West Indies in the 1912–13 season. The tour was organised by MCC. As in 1910–11, the team was captained by AWF Somerset. The tour involved a total of 9 matches, all of which are regarded as first-class, between January and March 1913.\nThe players.\nA party of 13 was taken:\nArthur Somerset senior, his son Arthur Somerset junior, Burton, Sydney Smith and Whittington had toured with the previous MCC team of 1910–11. Three good professionals were included, Humphreys, Relf and Razor Smith. Burton, Sydney Smith and Whittington had performed well on the previous tour and were arguably the best of the amateurs. As in the previous MCC tour the remaining players had little first-class experience. Despite being 57 years old the captain kept wicket in all the matches.\nThe tour.\nThe side arrived in Barbados on the \"RMS Magdalena\" on 27 January.\nMatches played were:\nOf the nine first class matches played in Barbados, Trinidad and British Guiana, five were won, three lost and one drawn.\nThe tourists lost the first two matches against Barbados by an innings but then defeated a West Indies XI with Humphreys taking 13 wickets.\nMoving on to Trinidad, the tourists won the first match but were lucky to draw the second. In the second match against the West Indies XI, Ince made 167 for the home side and they won by an innings. Cumberbatch was bowled when he shouldered his bat because he had been distracted by leaves blowing across the pitch. Given out by the umpire, he appealed to Somerset and was allowed to continue his innings, a sporting gesture by the captain. Burton and the captain added 89 for the last wicket in the MCC second innings and were only separated with 20 minutes remaining.\nIn British Guiana, the two matches against the colony were won comfortably and the third match against the West Indies XI was also won by 10 wickets with Humphreys scoring a century adding 152 with Whittington. Jaques and the captain added 80 for the last wicket. Moulder carried his bat in the West Indies second innings.\nThe three professionals headed the batting averages and, with Sydney Smith, took most of the wickets. Burton, Whittington and Sydney Smith also performed well with the bat.\nAverages.\nThe following averages are from the 9 first class matches (Batting Bowling)."

        "title": "English cricket team in the West Indies in 1934–35",
        "text": "The English cricket team in the West Indies in 1934–35 was a cricket touring party sent to the West Indies under the auspices of the Marylebone Cricket Club for a tour lasting months in 1934–35. The team played four Test matches against the West Indian cricket team, winning one match but losing two – the first series defeat of an English side by the West Indies.\nThe team comprised 14 players, but less than half of them were regular Test players. It \"could scarcely be regarded as representative of the full strength of England\", \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" reported in its 1936 edition coverage of the tour. By contrast, the West Indies side had developed since its disappointing tour of England in 1933. In Martindale, Constantine and Hylton it had a trio of high-class fast bowlers, and Jackie Grant was an experienced captain not given to the eccentricities that the England captain Wyatt inflicted on his team.\nThe touring party.\nThe team consisted of 14 players, including two wicketkeepers. The party was:\nOf the 14, only six had appeared in the Test matches against the Australians in the previous English cricket season. These six were Wyatt, Ames, Farnes, Hammond, Hendren and Leyland. Harbord had not played any first-class cricket in 1934 and only a dozen matches in the previous five years, Townsend did not play for a first-class county side, though he had had some success for Oxford University, and Farrimond was Lancashire's second-choice wicketkeeper, though he had played Test cricket in South Africa in 1930–31. In the event, Harbord and Farrimond played only four matches each on the tour.\nThe West Indies team.\nThe 1933 West Indies team in England lost two of the three Test matches by an innings, and won only five first-class matches across a hot and sunny summer. The tour was disappointing: \"The team did not play as well as we in this country had been led to believe they would\", wrote Wisden in a critical report. Exceptions to the criticism of the team included captain Jackie Grant, batsman George Headley, who had averaged 66 runs per innings in making 2320 first-class runs in the season, and fast bowler Manny Martindale, who took 103 wickets at less than 21 runs apiece.\nThe 1933 experience may have led the MCC to underestimate the West Indies side it would face in the Caribbean. In addition, the previous Test-playing tour to the West Indies in 1929–30 had seen a very unsettled home side, with each community selecting the team for its Test match and little continuity in the side.\nBy contrast, the 1934–35 West Indies side had a stable core of seven or eight players who played in all or most of the Tests. Grant remained as an experienced captain; Headley led the batting; Martindale was joined by a second fast bowler in Leslie Hylton and backed up by Learie Constantine, who had been available for only a few matches on the 1933 tour because of a Lancashire League commitment.\nThe Test matches.\nThe tour followed the itinerary of the previous Test-playing MCC tour in 1929–30, with four Tests arranged in the main cricket-playing territories in the West Indies: Barbados, Trinidad, British Guiana, and Jamaica. The Tests were each scheduled for four days.\nFirst Test.\nRain was the principal factor in a low-scoring match on a treacherous surface. Wyatt put the West Indies in on a rain-affected pitch and Farnes took four wickets for 15 runs as half the side were out for 31. George Headley rallied the team with 44 before being run out, but Paine and Hollies finished the innings off. England in turn collapsed to 81 for five by the end of the first day. Overnight rain then saturated the wicket to such an extent that play could not resume until after tea on the second day, and then, after Leslie Hylton took two wickets in the first over, Wyatt declared 21 runs behind. West Indies captain Jackie Grant shuffled his batting order in the hope the pitch would ease, but three wickets fell for four runs before Hylton and Cyril Christiani played out time on the second day. A further overnight deluge made play impossible until 3.30 on the third day. West Indies then lost three more wickets in adding 18 runs and Grant declared, setting England just 73 to win. Wyatt also rejigged his batting order with the aim that his tail-enders might blunt the West Indies attack. The move did not work, but Hammond with an unbeaten 29 and Hendren with 20 saw England through to victory. Manny Martindale took five second innings wickets for 22 runs.\nSecond Test.\nWyatt again won the toss and put the West Indies in, but innings of 92 from Derek Sealy and of 90 from Learie Constantine led to a respectable total. England lost their first five wickets for 23 runs to the West Indies fast bowlers. Hendren and Iddon put on 71, then Iddon and Holmes made 74 together, and Holmes, who made 85, put on 62 with Farrimond. West Indies' second innings was a determined effort with 93 from Headley and contributions from almost all the other batsmen. England were set 325 to win and Wyatt – in what Wisden termed an \"amazing and inexplicable course\" – all but reversed the batting order. Five wickets fell before tea on the last day and the innings was over with one ball of the day remaining with Leyland and Holmes the last pair.\nThird Test.\nWyatt won the toss again and batted after a start delayed by rain. Subdued batting, in which Paine, sent in as nightwatchman top-scored with 49, meant that the total only reached 198 by tea on the second day. An England collapse followed, but West Indies also batted slowly, with the exception of Headley. Hollies took seven wickets for 50 runs. England, with 71 from the captain, failed to force the pace in the second innings and the declaration left West Indies just two hours to make 203. When early wickets fell, the attempt was given up.\nFourth Test.\nWest Indies set a record for their highest Test score against England and Headley's 270 not out was the highest individual score for the West Indies. Headley shared partnerships of 202 with Sealy for the third wicket and of 147 for the seventh wicket with Rolph Grant. When England batted, Martindale inflicted a compound fracture of the jaw on Wyatt and four other wickets fell for 26 runs. Ames, with 126, turned the innings around with Iddon, who made 54, but England followed on 264 behind. Against Martindale and Constantine, there was limited resistance and the match ended soon after lunch on the fourth day.\nOther matches.\nThe MCC team played eight other first-class matches of three days' duration, two each against the four main cricketing territories, each set of two games preceding the Test match in the same venue. The touring side won only one of these games, the second match in British Guiana, but they were not beaten in any, though more than once they were close to defeat when the game ended."

        "text": "The English cricket team in the West Indies in 1959–60 played five Test matches, eight other first-class matches and two minor games. England won the Test series by one match to nil, with the other four matches being drawn.\nEngland touring party.\nFollowing the unsuccessful tour of Australia a year earlier, the selectors opted for youth, with only May, Cowdrey, Trueman and Statham having had substantial Test experience.\nTest series.\nMatches were played over six days, each of five hours.\n1st Test.\nCenturies by Barrington (his first Test hundred) and Dexter ensured that England made a big score. Alexander took five catches. In response, West Indies were 102/3, but then a mammoth fourth wicket partnership of 399 (still the record for that wicket for West Indies against all countries) by Sobers and Worrell took them into a first innings lead. In the circumstances, Trueman's analysis was a good one. West Indies had scored at under two and a half runs per over, and by the time that they declared England only had to bat for 140 minutes in their second innings. Allen for England, and Scarlett and Watson for West Indies, made their Test debuts. Statham was unfit, Moss playing in his stead.\n2nd Test.\nEngland lost three early wickets, but centuries by Barrington and Smith and 77 by Dexter ensured a competitive score, even though none of the last five batsmen managed more than 10. By the end of day two West Indies had reached 22/0 in reply. The third day's play was severely curtailed by a riot, but it was still the decisive day of the match, for West Indies slumped to 98/8. When their innings ended the next morning, Trueman had figures of 5/35 and Statham 3/42. West Indies' cause had not been helped by the other two wickets falling to run outs. Despite a first innings lead of 270, May did not enforce the follow-on. England in turn found batting difficult, at one point being 133/7, before useful contributions from Illingworth (41) and Trueman (37 made in 30 minutes) enabled them to declare on day five, setting West Indies an improbable 501 to win. A partnership between Hunte and Kanhai of 78 for the second wicket gave West Indies some hope of avoiding defeat, but Hunte was out for 47 before close of play, when West Indies were 134/2. On the final day, they could manage only another 110 runs before being all out. Only Kanhai, who batted for 378 minutes, offered the prolonged resistance that was needed. Singh made his Test debut for the West Indies.\nThe riot on the third day began soon after tea when Singh was adjudged run out, and prevented any further play that day. There was a crowd of almost 30,000, a record for any sporting event in the West Indies. A few spectators started throwing bottles onto the outfield. Many others followed their lead, after which many of the crowd came onto the field and a riot developed. The England players were escorted from the field, though the rioters had shown no hostility towards them.\n3rd Test.\nApart from Cowdrey, who having opened the England innings was ninth out, none of the England batsmen made more than 30 in the first innings. During his Test career, Hall never improved on his figures in this innings. By the end of the second day West Indies had reached 81/2 in their reply. Next day, they lost only McMorris, retired hurt, as they closed at 291/2, already with a first innings lead. Sobers was on 142 and Nurse, in his first Test, on 46. However Sobers' early dismissal next morning triggered a collapse, and although McMorris was fit to resume his innings the West Indies led by only 76. McMorris made 73 and Nurse 70. Cowdrey and Pullar more than wiped off the deficit, taking their first wicket stand to 177 before both were out at that score, Cowdrey narrowly missing his second century of the match. The innings then fell away, and with one day to go England, at 280/9, led by only 204. However next morning Allen and Statham held out for 45 minutes, adding 25 runs, and West Indies needed 230 in 245 minutes if they were to win. Hunte began in attacking fashion, scoring 40 out of 48 in an hour before he was the second man out. \"Wisden\" felt the turning-point came when Sobers was run out when looking dangerous, to make the score 86/3. West Indies continued to chase the target, but scoring was never easy. At tea 115 were still needed in 90 minutes. When Kanhai was out at 152/6 West Indies gave up the chase and England tried to get the four remaining wickets in the forty-five minutes that were left. May refused to allow Kanhai a runner near the end, when he had developed cramp. In fact Kanhai was entitled to a runner under the laws. May apologised to Kanhai and Alexander after the match for his mistake. The umpires and Alexander himself had also been unsure about the position.\nDuring the first day part of a tin roof collapsed from the weight of spectators standing on it, and several people were injured.\n4th Test.\nThis Test was similar to the previous one in many respects. Again Cowdrey top-scored in England's first innings and Hall was the most successful bowler. Again Sobers scored a century for West Indies, who once more secured a sizeable first innings lead but scored too slowly to have enough time to press home their advantage.\nThere were a number of changes in the sides from the previous Test. With May too ill to play and being forced to fly home, Cowdrey took over the England captaincy and Subba Row came into the side. West Indies were without Ramadhin because of shoulder trouble. Lance Gibbs was the intended replacement, but he had damaged his spinning finger, so that Scarlett was retained and Singh was included as a second spinner. Walcott, who had supposedly retired from Test cricket, was recalled, replacing Nurse. Worrell, who had not been fit for the previous Test, returned at the expense of Solomon.\nAfter a solid start on a rain-shortened first day, when they reached 152/2, England fell away on the second. Only 55 from Allen enabled them to make as many as 295 in the face of Hall's fast bowling. Alexander took four catches. Though West Indies achieved a substantial first innings lead, thanks largely to Sobers, they scored at not much over two runs an over. Between them, the two English off-spinners, Allen and Illingworth, bowled 85 overs for only 147 runs. Thanks to centuries by Dexter and Subba Row (his first in Tests), England had no difficulty in saving the game, reaching 320/3 at one point before there was a flurry of wickets when it was too late to matter.\n5th Test.\nStatham had flown home because his son was seriously ill, and Moss replaced him in the side. Swetman, the wicket-keeper, had managed only 58 runs in the first four Tests, and was dropped. With Andrew, the other wicket-keeper in the party, having few pretensions as a batsman, Parks – who had been coaching in Trinidad – took Swetman's place. His only previous Test appearance had been as a specialist batsman in 1954. West Indies included a third fast bowler, Griffith, making his Test debut. With Ramadhin fit again, Scarlett and Singh were omitted.\nAs in the four previous matches, England won the toss and batted first. For the third Test in succession, Cowdrey and Sobers top-scored in their respective sides' first innings. The first day ended with England 256/3, Cowdrey and Dexter having added 191 in 225 minutes for the third wicket before Dexter was out for 76. Next day, though Barrington took his score to 69 and Parks made 43, England only added another 137 for their last seven wickets. In reply, West Indies were at one point 190/2, thanks to Sobers and Walcott (53), but declined to 230/6. Hunte, who had retired hurt when the total was 24, returned to make 72* by the time that West Indies declared 55 behind in the hope of forcing a win. With England declining to 148/6 when Dexter was run out for 47, they seemed likely do so. However Smith and Parks then put on 197, which remains England's seventh wicket record partnership against all countries. Parks' hundred was his first in Tests. Cowdrey's declaration left West Indies a notional 406 to win at 140 an hour. Though they had no hope of winning, West Indies managed to score at four runs an over in their second innings, a better rate than they had generally managed in the series.\nAlexander finished with 23 dismissals, which equalled the then world record for a Test series.\nOther first-class matches.\nWon 3, lost 1, drew 4.\nControversies.\nThough the tour was less acrimonious than that made by England six years earlier, according to \"Wisden\" there were nevertheless still some contentious issues, notably those of slow over rates, excessive short-pitched bowling and throwing. England were the main culprits in wasting time; having won the second Test they set out to avoid defeat in the remaining three matches. Short-pitched bowling was overdone, especially by the West Indian fast bowlers Hall and Watson. Two bowlers playing regularly for West Indies in the Tests had actions that \"Wisden\" considered to be suspect."

        "title": "English cricket team in the West Indies in 1993–94",
        "text": "The England cricket team toured the West Indies in the 1993–94 season. The tour consisted of five Test matches and five One Day Internationals as well as five other matches against first-class opposition. The fourth Test of the series, at Bridgetown, was the 700th Test match to be played by England.\nThe England team were captained by Mike Atherton in his first tour as captain, and they were looking to put their recent poor results behind them, and follow up on the Sixth Test victory over Australia. The only surprising element of the touring party was the omission of Peter Such, the leading wicket taker against Australia, in favour of the promising Ian Salisbury, though it seemed that Phil Tufnell was considered the senior spinner in the squad. In contrast to previous captain Graham Gooch, Atherton adopted a more relaxed approach to touring, allowing players time off rather than continual practicing, though perhaps Chris Lewis's decision to get his head shaved on a day off was a mistake – he spent a full day recovering from the subsequent sun-stroke.\nThe West Indies were defending a recent record on home turf that had seen them win twelve and drawing two of their previous fourteen home series. They were led by a weary Richie Richardson, who had complained prior to the series about the excessive amount of cricket that he and strike bowlers Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh had been required to play in the previous twelve months. Veteran West Indian commentator Tony Cozier noted in the Independent that the supporting bowlers were \"all worthy triers with modest county records who are unlikely to worry Atherton and his fellow batsmen\". As it turned out, Winston Benjamin and Kenneth Benjamin both provided excellent back-up throughout the series, ending up with 12 and 22 wickets respectively, as the West Indies won the Test series 3–1.\nEngland developed good positions in all of the first four Tests, but failed to capitalise, and struggled with confidence in key situations.\nSquads.\nThe squads selected for the Test and One-day series were as follows:\nWarm-up matches.\nDuring the warm-up matches, John \"The Dentist\" Maynard came to international prominence. In the first, representing St Kitts and Nevis, he took three of the England top order wickets in the first innings, dismissing Michael Atherton, Matthew Maynard and Nasser Hussain. He finished with 3/91 as Mark Ramprakash took command, scoring 136. He then played for the Leeward Islands in the second, picking up the wickets of Graham Thorpe, Graeme Hick and Ramprakash. The seven top-order batsman had scored just 44 runs between them.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nEngland came into the First Test with some confidence, having enjoyed a largely successful series of warm-up matches and winning the first One-day International. Captain Mike Atherton was in particularly good form with the bat at the top of the order. The England eleven contained four seamers and no specialist spinner, with Alan Igglesden getting the nod for the fourth spot ahead of the injured Angus Fraser (fractured finger) and Steve Watkin (back trouble). For the West Indies, Jimmy Adams came in for the injured Carl Hooper, while Winston and Kenny Benjamin provided the back-up seamer duties.\nEngland won the toss and opted to bat first on a pretty benign pitch. Atherton (55) and Alec Stewart (70) made light work of the early going, advancing steadily throughout the first session. They added 121 for the first wicket but then the fireworks came. An hour before tea, Kenny Benjamin (6–66) had both openers caught behind by Junior Murray, then Robin Smith was clean bowled by Courtney Walsh for a duck. Graeme Hick and Graham Thorpe consolidated, before the former was winkled out by Adams, and Thorpe and Jack Russell followed with the score remaining on 172. Matthew Maynard dug in, but with wickets falling all around him, especially with Kenny Benjamin's impressive line and movement, he was unable to attack, and none of the tail could muster any significant support.\nWest Indies' reply looked equally sketchy when the opening tandem of Devon Malcolm and Andrew Caddick removed the top three with only 23 on the scoreboard, but Brian Lara (83) and Keith Arthurton (126) did what West Indian batsmen have done often over the past two decades: they counter-attacked and put the pressure back on the bowlers. These two added 144, then Adams (95*) came to the party, and with excellent support from Murray and Winston Benjamin took the hosts to an impressive 389/6 before Caddick (3–94) and Chris Lewis combined to wrap the tail up.\nEngland's second innings was a disappointment to rival the first – of the batsmen only Hick provided any real resistance, demonstrating a previously absent confidence against fast bowling. Coach Keith Fletcher noted at close of play on the third day that \"if he can play that, he can play anything\". He was aided by Lewis and Caddick, who each stuck around for more than an hour as he compiled 96, but ultimately it was a vain effort, as the visitors subsided to 267 all out. All four pace bowlers picked up wickets, with Walsh looking the most threatening and doing the damage at the top of the order. The victory target of 95 was achieved with little fuss, though Caddick and Igglesden took wickets along the way.\n2nd Test.\nIn the first Test played by England at Bourda since 1973–74, Shivnarine Chanderpaul made his Test debut for the West Indies on his home ground, replacing Phil Simmons, while Richardson moved up to open the innings with Desmond Haynes. For the tourists, Ian Salisbury came in for Caddick, and the impressive Malcolm was replaced by Fraser, with Maynard losing out to Mark Ramprakash for the sixth batting place.\nEngland were inserted and started disastrously, losing Stewart and Ramprakash to Walsh's new ball spell before Atherton (144) and Smith (84) settled in, removed the shine and set about building the innings. They added 171 before Smith became the third man to fall, but Hick picked up from where he had left off at Sabina Park, compiling an innings of 33 that mixed aggression with temperance. Atherton was not out at the close on the first day, but Hick and Thorpe were both victims of the second new ball – Ambrose their tormentor this time around. The second morning was much less productive for the visitors, and although Lewis and Russell batted sensibly, they and final wicket Igglesden all fell with the score on 322. The West Indies openers saw off the new ball, and Haynes (63) and Lara (167) added their own century stand. Arthurton went cheaply, but Jimmy Adams justified his continued selection with a superb 137, his maiden test century, sharing partnerships of 112 with Lara, 126 with Chanderpaul (62) and 64 with Winston Benjamin, before being the last man out. Salisbury took four wickets but was very expensive, going at more than four an over.\nEngland struggled to make up the deficit, slipping to 30/2 and 96/4, with Stewart (79) the only batsman to impress, and Ambrose (4–37) approaching his best as a bowler, demolishing the top order. Lewis and Salisbury batted stolidly for two hours for 35, but the tail couldn't wag any further, and Kenny Benjamin (4–34) finished it off without the West Indies having to bat again.\nPost-match, Atherton identified the bowling as a key weakness in the England side, noting the speed with which the home team scored their runs, while Richardson mischievously targeted a 5–0 series whitewash.\n3rd Test.\nRichardson won the toss and elected to bat, a decision that looked excellent as the captain (63), veteran opener Haynes and young star Lara guided the West Indies to 158/1. Salisbury, Lewis (4–61) and Fraser (4–49) precipitated a collapse though, and the home side ended the first day 227/7, and were soon dismissed on the second morning. England's reply looked equally sketchy in the early stages, subsiding to 115/4 at one stage, before, Hick (40), Thorpe (86), Russell and Salisbury guided them to a respectable total.\nIn the second innings, Caddick showed signs of returning to his best and took good advantage of the deterioration of the pitch, using good short-of-a-length deliveries to pick up six wickets and put England in a commanding position, needing just 194 to win. The target would have been even lower, if Hick had not dropped a catch offered by Chanderpaul, early in his innings shortly after the fifth wicket had fallen: instead Chanderpaul hung around to score his first Test fifty, and was ably supported by the tail, particularly Winston Benjamin (35), in putting over another hundred runs on the board. England's reply consequently began a couple of hours later in the day than they might have expected halfway through the West Indian innings, and with the Windies having recovered a good deal of confidence with their late-order tail-wagging having set England a more challenging target than they could have expected a couple of hours previously. Curtly Ambrose (6–24) was at his most devastating, removing Atherton with his first delivery and Smith not long afterwards: in between, Ramprakash was somewhat needlessly run out, putting England in dire straits. Only Stewart managed to get into double figures, and only he and Thorpe survived more than half an hour at the crease facing the menace of Walsh and Ambrose, and by the close on the fourth day, England were reeling at 40/8, still 5 short of their lowest score in Tests.\nWalsh (3–16) picked up the last two wickets the next morning, as the tourists just scraped past their unwanted milestone, but they couldn't help feeling that this was a match they should have won. Captain Atherton noted that \"we played well for three days\", and journalist Alan Lee reported that England \"are short not only of technical excellence but of mental resilience and self-belief\" when the pressure is applied.\n4th Test.\nEngland's preparation for the fourth test included a first-class match against a West Indies board side that pretty much outplayed the tourists, which was not what they had wanted, though Hick and Ramprakash both scored vital runs to help build their individual confidence.\nThat said, on being inserted, Atherton (85) and Stewart (118) set a superb base for the innings, batting through to the middle of the afternoon session and adding 171 for the first wicket. Stewart and Ramprakash added a further 52, but the middle order were unable to build on this and although several batsmen got starts, the tourists had to rely on Russell's 38 to shepherd the tail to a defendable total. Winston (3–76) and Kenny Benjamin (2–74) did the damage to the batsmen, while Ambrose helped himself to four more wickets from Hick, Russell and the tail.\nEngland's bowlers made light of the West Indies vaunted batting line-up, with Fraser especially bringing some steel and determination to the attack. His 8–75 was testament to his perseverance, and was the best innings analysis by an England bowler since Bob Willis's destruction of the Australians at Headingley in 1981. Chanderpaul again defied his lack of experience with a four-hour 77, and he received sterling support from Ambrose (44) and Kenny Benjamin (43*) that dragged the total above 300.\nDespite the losses of Atherton, Ramprakash and Smith leaving England 79/3, Stewart and Hick (59) worked hard to set the hosts a challenging target. They added 115 for the fourth wicket, and Stewart's 143 made him the seventh Englishman to score a century in both innings of a Test. Stewart and Thorpe (84) added another 150 and set up the declaration. Walsh was the most successful of the West Indies' bowlers, collecting five of the seven wickets to fall.\nNeeding 446 to win, the hosts were already without Haynes, who had suffered a hand injury in the first innings, and soon lost their remaining opener Richardson to injury too, struggling with a pulled hamstring. Adams and nightwatchman Kenny Benjamin were both dismissed before the close on the fourth day and although Lara and Arthurton steadied the ship somewhat, it wasn't enough to fend off the newly inspired Caddick (5–63), who received great support from the tireless Tufnell (3–100), as the West Indies were dismissed for 237.\nEngland's victory marked the first by a visiting side in Barbados for 59 years, and broke a streak of twelve consecutive home victories at the ground. It also broke a streak of seven successive Test defeats for England away from home. \"I had no doubts that we would lift our game here\", Atherton reflected after the game. \"It was a rarefied atmosphere out there this afternoon and our victory rates as a very sweet moment for me.\"\n5th Test.\nWith Haynes and Richardson both absent after their injuries in the Barbados Test, the West Indies needed two new openers and drafted in Phil Simmons and debutant Stuart Williams to fill those roles. Courtney Walsh captained the side. England named an unchanged eleven.\nWalsh won the toss and batted, and the two new openers were soon back in the pavilion, Caddick and Fraser picking up the wickets in their first spells, leaving the home side 12/2 and bringing Lara to the crease early in the day. By the close of play, he was still there, 164 not out, had added 179 with Jimmy Adams (59), and was already dominating his partnership with Keith Arthurton (47). These two added 187 for the fourth wicket as Lara despatched the bowling to all parts of the ground, his second century coming in just 131 balls. Chanderpaul (75*) joined him in the last session of the second day, as Lara progressed to 320, and they continued the next morning, adding a total of 219 before Lara was finally dismissed by Caddick for a new individual Test batting record of 375, and Walsh promptly declared.\nScenes on the ground were chaotic when Lara overtook the existing record of 365, as the batsmen embraced and the crowd rushed onto the field. Police held the mob back, and Sir Garfield Sobers, whose record Lara had broken, came out to the middle to congratulate Lara on the new record. Play was held up for about seven minutes. Lara's innings took twelve and three quarter hours and comprised 538 deliveries, 45 of which he struck for boundaries (all fours).\nEngland's reply was subdued in comparison with the jubilant scenes they had just witnessed. Stewart and Ramprakash both got starts, but fell to Kenny Benjamin before they could progress. Atherton and Smith provided the English fans with a partnership of their own to celebrate, adding 303 for the third wicket in just short of seven hours. Smith (175) was the dominant partner, striking 16 fours and three sixes, and once he was out a flurry of wickets fell, the tourists going from 372/2 to 417/6, Atherton finally being dismissed after nine hours for a dogged 135. Russell (62) and Lewis (75*) added a century partnership as well, bringing England level with the West Indies total.\nThe match petered out on the final afternoon with Simmons and Williams not out and England using Stewart and Thorpe to bowl when the agreement to call it a draw finally came.\nTour overview and comments.\nEngland.\nThe tour ended with more hope for the England team than could have been expected after the Third Test, when Richardson targeted a whitewash. Although they had played well in patches, they had not fulfilled their potential, and the final two tests provided something more of a measure of where the team stood when they performed at their best.\nAlan Lee reported in \"The Times\" after the tour that the tour had achieved relatively little for England, with the #3 batting slot and the development of an all-rounder still at issue, as well as questions over the strength of the bowling attack. On the positive side he also noted Atherton's development as a captain and batsman, remarking that the Lancastrian \"could captain England for years to come, not only because he is so young but because he plainly thrives on it\" and that \"his batting has flourished with the responsibility\".\nAtherton, Stewart and Hick did well with the bat, despite the capitulation in Trinidad, Stewart looking much more effective without wicketkeeping duties encumbering him, and Caddick (18 wickets) began to look threatening. Fraser bowled with heart and guts, as well as with occasional menace when conditions allowed, such as in Barbados, and took 16 well-deserved wickets. Tufnell bowled economically, but was rather underused.\nThe rest of the squad were disappointing though. Of the other batsmen, only Smith averaged over 30, and that was flattered by his big century at Antigua. He was in terrible form for the vast majority of the tour. Ramprakash averaged just over 10 in four Tests – a poor return for a man of his talents. None of the other bowlers impressed at all – Salisbury picked up seven wickets, but they were expensive, and Igglesden and Malcolm showed little to earn continued selection in the Tests in their brief appearances. Steve Watkin didn't even get that chance in the Test series, despite his fine end to the 1993 Ashes, after an early injury gave the impetus to others.\nWest Indies.\nThe highlights of the West Indian side in the tour were clear and apparent. Brian Lara established himself as one of the world's pre-eminent batsmen with his triple century in Antigua, and was well supported by Jimmy Adams, Desmond Haynes and the emerging Shivnarine Chanderpaul. Curtly Ambrose spearheaded the attack to devastating effect at times, and when he was not totally on form the back up bowling, particularly of Kenny Benjamin, delivered to fill the gap. Courtney Walsh was also his efficient and dangerous self.\nThe lack of a spin bowler did not hamper the West Indians in this series, but might be a concern for future tours, particularly of the Indian sub-continent. The fourth seamer spot may still also be up for grabs, despite Winston Banjamin's occasional success, and the lack of depth may be exposed if Ambrose and Walsh are unable to replicate their so-far excellent form.\nExternal sources.\nCricketArchive"

In 1924 Prospect Cricket Club, based at Prospect Oval, was admitted to the SACA B Grade Competition.\nThe North Adelaide Cricket Club was originally formed in 1867 as North Adelaide Young Men's Society. It was a foundation member of the SACA competition and won four premierships between 1879 and 1896. It was based at Adelaide Oval.\nA decision of the SACA to revise the District boundaries for the 1928–29 season led to discussions between the two clubs, the SACA and the Prospect Council, which eventually resulted in the amalgamation of the two clubs. The new Club would continue in the SACA A Grade competition, with its\nhome base at Prospect Oval.

Hendry had led 9–6, before Williams tied it to 9–9. Williams was then trailing 56–34 in the final frame, when he potted the brown and the remaining colours to tie the scores in the match, after Hendry missed the brown. They then played seven shots on the black in a match similar to the 1985 World Championship final between Dennis Taylor and Steve Davis. Hendry then missed a straight black across the nap in the middle pocket before Williams potted it on the top right pocket to claim his first Masters title.\nField.\nDefending champion Steve Davis was the number 1 seed with World Champion Ken Doherty seeded 2. Places were allocated to the top 16 players in the world rankings.

        "title": "English cricket team in Sri Lanka in 1981–82",
        "text": "The England cricket team toured Sri Lanka in February 1982. The tour included two One Day International (ODI) matches and one Test match. Sri Lanka had become a Test playing nation the year before, and this was their inaugural Test match. Many celebrations had been prepared in Sri Lanka, include the issuing of commemorative stamps and coins.\nEngland won the first ODI, but Sri Lanka won the second, causing large celebrations in the country. They also played well in the first Test match, but the Sri Lankan batting collapsed on the last day, resulting in a seven-wicket victory for England.\nBackground.\nSri Lanka had obtained Full Member status of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1981, making them the eighth Test playing nation. The Test match against England in February 1982 was to be their inaugural Test match. Therefore, the tour was met with much enthusiasm, and Sri Lanka had even issued commemorative stamps and coins to mark the event. Celebrations were organized, and even shops and businesses were planned to be closed on the day of the match. Several cricket grounds had been renovated and improved as well. When Sri Lanka won the second One Day International, the spectators rushed the pitch and lit bonfires in the stands, and celebrations went on into the night. However, attendance at the Test match was lower than expected, with about 10,000 spectators present at the start. This was presumed to be due to high ticket prices and television coverage. However, several dignitaries including President J. R. Jayewardene and some government ministers were present at the occasion.\nAfter they arrived in the island after a tour of India, the English team had played a practice three-day match against the Sri Lanka Board President's XI on 9 February 1982. The match, which was played at the Asgiriya Stadium in Kandy, ended in a draw.\nSri Lanka celebrated the 25th anniversary of their first Test match in 2006.\nFirst ODI.\nSri Lanka got off to a bad start with wicketkeeper Rohan Jayasekera dropped opening batsman Graham Gooch off the very first delivery from Ashantha de Mel. The English opening pair took their team's score to 55 before Geoff Cook was dismissed as their first wicket. When the next batsman, David Gower, was run out with England's total on 83, Ian Botham joined Gooch at the crease and put together a strong partnership. At one stage, these two batsmen scored 43 runs off 5 overs. Gooch was dropped two more times before he was dismissed for 64 with the total on 152, followed by Botham with their team total on 191. However, the English batting collapsed after this, and they were all out for 211 in the last over of the innings.\nIn the Sri Lankan innings, England got their first breakthrough when opening batsman and captain Bandula Warnapura was dismissed for 10 runs. However, Sidath Wettimuny along with Jayasekera took their team to 74. Sri Lanka were then in trouble when their third, fourth, and fifth wickets fell within 8 runs. Despite this, Ranjan Madugalle and Anura Ranasinghe put together a partnership of 68 runs, scoring at an average of 6 runs an over. Some strong hitting from the tail-end batsmen took Sri Lanka closer to their target, but they had managed only 206 for 8 wickets at the end of their innings, just 5 runs short of their target.\nSecond ODI.\nAlmost 22,000 spectators had gathered to watch the second ODI match. Sri Lanka, having been put to bat, got off to another bad start when they lost their first two wickets for just 5 runs. However, Wettimuny batted well at the other end, and along with Roy Dias, took the team to 43 before Dias was dismissed. He was then joined by debutant Arjuna Ranatunga, who scored 42 and helped take the team to 130, before getting run out. The rest of the Sri Lankan batsmen did not get to big scores, and Sri Lanka was at 215 for 7 wickets by the end of the innings, with Wettimuny unbeaten on 86.\nEngland started well, with the openers Gooch and Cook putting together a partnership of 109 runs before Cook was dismissed as England's first wicket. However, they lost their second and third wickets at 122, and despite a 38 run stand from Botham their scoring slowed down. England had to score 14 runs from the last two overs, with five of their wickets remaining. The English batsmen, in an attempt to score quickly, lost their sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth wickets in quick succession, all of them run out. With two balls remaining in the match, England's last batsman Bob Willis hit the ball high in the air, and was caught by Madugalle. The match ended in victory for Sri Lanka, with England just 3 runs short of their target.\nThe One Day series ended in a draw. Gooch was the top scorer for England with 138 runs in total, and Wettimuny for Sri Lanka with 132. They were the only batsmen to score more than 100 runs in the series. Botham took 4 wickets for 74 runs in the series, the most by an English bowler. De Mel was the most successful bowler for Sri Lanka, taking 6 wickets for 48 runs.\nOnly Test.\nThe Sri Lankan side was captained on their inaugural Test by Warnapura, who won the toss and elected to bat first. He opened the batting along with Wettimuny, and faced the first delivery from Willis. He also scored the first run for Sri Lanka, and according to a local newspaper, was the first to be hit on the chest. Warnapura then became the first batsman to lose his wicket, when he was caught by Gower off the bowling of Willis. Dias, Wettimuny and Duleep Mendis soon followed, leaving Sri Lanka in a difficult position at 34 runs for 4 wickets. However, a 99 run partnership between Madugalle and Ranatunga, with both batsmen scoring double centuries, took the Sri Lankan score to 183 before Ranatunga was dismissed. At the end of the day, Sri Lanka was at 138 for 8 wickets, with Madugalle remaining unbeaten on 64.\nThe last two wickets of the first Sri Lankan innings fell the next morning, and the English batsmen took to the crease. De Mel soon captured their first three wickets, leaving the English total at 44 for 3 wickets. However, Gower was dropped early in his innings, a mistake which would prove costly for the Sri Lankans. Gower and English captain Keith Fletcher took the team to 120 before the latter was dismissed. At the end of play for the day, England was at 186 for 5 wickets, with Gower and Bob Taylor at the crease.\nThe next day, 19 February, was a rest day. By the time Gower was dismissed for 89 runs the next day (20 February), England was at 200 runs for 6 wickets. However, the rest of the batsmen were dismissed for low scores and England ended up with 223 runs, having managed only 37 runs that day. In the Sri Lankan second innings, Warnapura and Dias built up a strong partnership despite having lost Wettimuny early. At the end of the third day, Sri Lanka had lost both of them, and were at 152 for 3 wickets, leading England by 147 runs.\nAlthough the Sri Lankans were in a strong position at the start of the fourth day, but their batting soon collapsed when John Emburey took 5 wickets for just 5 runs. Only Warnapura, Dias and Mendis managed to score more than 20 runs, and none of the others got past 10. Sri Lanka ended up with 175 runs, leaving England a target of 171. De Mel struck early when he dismissed Cook without scoring, but Gooch and Chris Tavare took England to 84 before the former was dismissed. Tavare was then joined by Gower, and the pair took their team total to 167 before Tavare was stumped. However, the remaining runs were taken by Gower, and the match ended in victory for England."

England won the Test series 2–1, while Sri Lanka took the ODI series 3–0.\nTest series.\nControversy.\nSri Lanka's B. C. Cooray alongside South Africa's Rudi Koertzen were appointed as standing umpires for the second Test match at Asgiriya Stadium, Kandy. He and Koertzen made fair share of errors during the test match which eventually changed the outcome of the match with England winning the match by a margin of three wickets in a low scoring yet tricky run-chase. Both of them were even escorted safely from the stadium by the security officials due to the tense situation which arose during the course of the match as fans chanted and booed the umpires in the stands criticising their erroneous calls. The match consisted at least 13 clear umpiring mistakes with Cooray playing the majority of his part. The Sri Lankan local fans vent their frustrations in the stands protesting against his umpiring blunders by holding placards and banners mentioning and accusing Cooray of having sold the match to secure a visa to England. The phrases \"B.C You Sold This Match. Have Got Your Resident Visa for England\" were seen during the fourth day of the match.\nCooray took the centre-stage when England were batting in their first innings where he turned down the loud appeals on three occasions when England skipper Nasser Hussain was trapped lbw which was later proven costly as far as Sri Lanka were concerned as Hussain went onto complete a match winning century and in fact Hussain was the beneficiary of Cooray's umpiring. He also denied the caught and bowled dismissal claimed by Muttiah Muralitharan when Graeme Hick was batting. On the other hand, Atherton also survived a close lbw call thanks largely due to Cooray. He also made another ridiculous decision by ruling out Sanath Jayasuriya during Sri Lanka's second innings when replays clearly suggested that the ball bowled by Andrew Caddick had actually bumped well before it was taken on bounce by slip fielder Graham Thorpe who actually had to dive in order to complete the catch. Jayasuriya who was a casualty of Cooray's brain fade umpiring showed dissent at the decision as he hurled his helmet across the boundary line. The continuous flaws in umpiring also increased tensions between the team players of Sri Lanka and England with Kumar Sangakkara at one point losing his cool and involved in an heated verbal exchange with England's Michael Atherton and eventually Sangakkara labelled England as \"cheats\".\nHe also received backlash for his refusal to admit the mistakes he committed during the match. During the post-match presentations, fans of Sri Lanka and England yelled for him to be named Man of the Match. Initial reports by local media revealed that he would be dropped for the third and final test of the series, thus forcing him to a retirement from umpiring. However, the reports were deemed rumours as he was recalled as TV umpire for the third and final test which was confirmed by K. T. Francis who then served as the director of umpiring with the Sri Lanka Cricket. Despite such assurance from Francis, the second Test at Asgiriya turned out to be his last international match as an umpire."

        "text": "The Indian cricket team toured Sri Lanka in August 1997, participating in two Test matches and three One Day International (ODI) matches. During the first Test match, Sri Lanka scored 952 runs for 6 wickets, the highest team total in Test cricket. Several more records were established in this match, including the highest partnership for the second wicket by Sanath Jayasuriya and Roshan Mahanama. The Test series ended without a result, with both Test matches drawn.\nSri Lanka won all three of the One Day International matches, although the third one had to be replayed due to bad weather. Sanath Jayasuriya was the most notable player during the tournament. He was selected as player of the series in both the Test series and the ODI series, and won two-man of the match awards as well. He was the highest scoring batsman during the Test series, and also took the highest number of wickets for Sri Lanka in the ODI series. His tally of 571 runs was (and as of 2022, remains) the highest total by a batsman in a two-Test series.\nBackground.\nThe Indian cricket team had arrived in Sri Lanka on 12 July 1997 to participate in the Asia Cup. After that, they stayed on in the country for two Test matches and three One Day International matches with the Sri Lankan cricket team. The Sri Lankans were the world champions, having won the cricket world cup the previous year, and had also won the Asia Cup, having beaten India in the final.\nTest series.\nAlthough only two Test matches had been scheduled for the tour, the Test series turned out to be a significant one in cricketing history. Both were high scoring matches, with the total runs scored in each match exceeding 1,400. Both matches were drawn, but a number of world records were established during the series, particularly in the first match. India played a three-day tour match before the first Test against the Sri Lanka Board President's XI, starting on 29 July. The match ended in a draw, with the Indians scoring 308 runs in their first innings. The President's XI responded with 291, and the Indian team had scored 255 for 5 wickets for their second innings by the end of the match. Sanath Jayasuriya was the highest scorer of the series with 571 runs, while Sachin Tendulkar produced 290 runs for the Indians. Muttiah Muralitharan was the highest wicket taker of the series with 9 wickets, followed by Anil Kumble with 5. Both Tests, as well as the practice match, were held in Colombo. The fact that all the matches of the tour were in Colombo was criticized by the media, and the Indian players and officials were also not happy about it. The cricket board had ruled out other venues reportedly due to bad weather.\nFirst Test.\nIndian captain Sachin Tendulkar won the toss and decided to bat first. Opener Nayan Mongia got out early with the score on 36. However, Navjot Singh Sidhu and Rahul Dravid took the Indians to 183 before Sidhu was caught behind for 111. Dravid then paired up with Tendulkar, but was dismissed by Sanath Jayasuriya for 69, with the Indian score on 223. Mohammad Azharuddin then joined Tendulkar on the crease, and the two batsmen put together a formidable partnership and had taken India to 280 runs at the end of the day. On the second day, both batsmen had scored centuries and placed India in a strong position. However, the consistent scoring came to a halt with the wicket of Tendulkar, who was caught on 143 with the team total on 451. Sourav Ganguly went for a duck soon after, and wickets began to fall at regular intervals. Azharuddin was dismissed for 126 when India was on 479. Two more wickets fell at 516 and 537, and India declared on 537 runs for 8 wickets.\nThe Sri Lankan openers Sanath Jayasuriya and Marvan Atapattu went out on to the pitch later in the day. However, Atapattu was caught behind off the very first delivery of debutant Nilesh Kulkarni for 26. At the close of play on the second day, Sri Lanka were on 39/1, with Jayasuriya not out on 12 and Roshan Mahanama on the other end. The pair batted throughout the third day and took Sri Lanka to 322/1. Both had scored centuries, and their partnership was at 283 runs. Jayasuriya and Mahanama continued to bat throughout the fourth day as well, and added 265 more to their partnership, taking Sri Lanka to 587/1. Jayasuriya had scored the first triple century by a Sri Lankan batsman, and was followed by Mahanama with a double hundred. Jayasuriya was 50 runs short of the highest individual Test score (375 by Brian Lara). On the fifth day, a large crowd had gathered at the R. Premadasa Stadium, anticipating a new world record from Jayasuriya. 30,000 were allowed entry free of charge. However, Mahanama was out leg before wicket early in the day for 225 off the bowling of Anil Kumble, when the Sri Lankan score was at 615. Soon after that, Jayasuriya was caught on 340 by Ganguly at silly point off the bowling of Rajesh Chauhan. However, the scoring continued as captain Arjuna Ranatunga paired up with Aravinda de Silva and took the team to 790. When Ranatunga was dismissed for 86, debutant Mahela Jayawardene joined de Silva at the crease. They took their team's total past 903, Jayawardene scored 66 runs before being dismissed with the Sri Lankan total on 921. With the score on 924, de Silva was dismissed as well, and Romesh Kaluwitharana and Chaminda Vaas continued to bat for several more overs. They had taken the total to 952/6 before the innings was declared by the Sri Lankans.\nSecond Test.\nSachin Tendulkar once again won the toss, but decided to put the Sri Lankans to bat first. The first Sri Lankan wicket fell on 53, when Sanath Jayasuriya, the high scorer of the first Test, was dismissed by debutant Debasis Mohanty for 32 runs. Marvan Atapattu got out soon after that. Aravinda de Silva joined Roshan Mahanama at the crease and took the Sri Lankans to 121, before Mahanama got out for 37. De Silva continued to bat, although both Arjuna Ranatunga and Mahela Jayawardene were dismissed for 14 and 16 respectively. Romesh Kaluwitharana (6) and Chaminda Vaas (10) also followed, before Muttiah Muralitharan paired up with de Silva at the end of the day to take the team total to 317. De Silva was finally caught behind the next day for 146, and Muralitharan put up ten more runs on the board before he was dismissed, followed by Ravindra Pushpakumara for a duck.\nIndia got off to a bad start in their first innings, losing their first two wickets before the total had even reached 10. Tendulkar and Sidhu put up a 72 run partnership, before India lost the wicket of Sidhu, followed by Mohommad Azharuddin. However, Sourav Ganguly joined Tendulkar at the crease and the two batsmen took the Indian total to 226/4 by the end of the day. Tendulkar scored a century after being dropped by Arjuna Ranatunga, who was injured in the attempt and had to retire. On the third day, Ganguly scored a century as well. However, the batsmen after Tendulkar and Ganguly failed to score well, and the Indians were restricted to 375.\nIn the Sri Lankans' second innings, Atapattu was dismissed for 29, and the score was at 77/1 at the end of the day. On the fourth day, Mahanama was dismissed for 35 but Jayasuriya, who was then joined by Aravinda de Silva, was heading for another big score. The two batsmen put up a 218 run partnership, a new Sri Lankan record for the third wicket. Jayasuriya became the first batsman to reach 1000 runs that year, and at one stage seemed to be reaching the world record for the fastest double century. However, he was bowled out by Nilesh Kulkarni for 199. De Silva, who had been dropped earlier and bowled by a no ball, ended up with 120, scoring a century in both innings of a match for the second time in his career. The Sri Lankan innings was declared after his wicket fell, with the total at 415/7.\nBeginning the Indians' second innings, opener Ajay Jadeja scored 73 runs, but wickets fell at regular intervals at the other end. Sidhu, Tendulkar and Dravid had been dismissed before the total reached 100, and Jadeja was dismissed with the score on 138. However, Mohammad Azharuddin paired up with Ganguly and put up a 110 run stand for the fifth wicket, guiding the Indians out of danger and denying the Sri Lankans the chance of victory. Azharuddin was dropped thrice, and made good use of the chances he got, ending up with an unbeaten 108. The Indians' final score was at 281/5.\nODI series.\nThree One Day International matches were originally scheduled for the tour, but the third match had to be replayed the following day since it had to be abandoned due to bad weather. As in the Test series, the ODIs were also largely dominated by the batsmen. India played a tour match against the Sri Lankan Board President's XI on 15 August, which they won by 2 wickets. The President's XI had scored 240, and the Indians responded with 243 for 8 wickets in 49.3 overs, with 95 runs coming from Rahul Dravid. The first match created some controversy when the television broadcast showed umpire K. T. Francis wiping the ball on what appeared to be an Indian flag. However, it later turned out to be a bar towel with the same colours.\nFirst ODI.\nTendulkar won the toss and chose to field. The Sri Lankan openers made a partnership of 91 runs in 14 overs, with a quick 73 from Jayasuriya. After he was bowled out, Atapattu and Mahanama took the Sri Lankan score to 199 before Mahanama was dismissed for 53. Aravinda de Silva paired up with Atapattu to take the total to 279, before he was dismissed. Atapattu, who made his maiden century, was run out for 118 and the Sri Lankans ended their innings with a total of 302/4.\nThe Indian openers made a stand of 58 runs until the dismissal of Sourav Ganguly, but wickets began to fall rapidly after that. The Indian total was at 64/4 at the eleventh over when Ajay Jadeja joined Mohammad Azharuddin at the crease. These two batsmen took the Indians to safety with a record partnership of 232 runs, and took India to 287 before Jadeja was dismissed by Vaas for 119. Both Mongia and Chauhan got out in quick succession, and Azharuddin was left with the task of getting 5 runs off the last delivery of the match. However, he only managed 2, and the Indians ended up with 300 runs, just 3 short of the required target. Azharuddin remained unbeaten on 111.\nSecond ODI.\nThe Sri Lankans won the toss and decided to field first, and got an early breakthrough when Tendulkar was dismissed for 6. However, Sourav Ganguly and Robin Singh took the Indians to 105 before Singh was dismissed as the second wicket. Azharuddin and Dravid also got out without scoring much, leaving the Indians at 159/4. Jadeja and Ganguly then built up a partnership and took the total to 218, with Ganguly scoring his maiden century. However, the last six wickets fell within 26 runs, and the final Indian score was at 238.\nJayasuriya and Atapattu made a good partnership again, taking their team to 79. After Atapattu was dismissed for 38, Jayasuriya paired up with Mahanama to take the Sri Lankans to 130, before he was dismissed for 66. Mahanama was run out for 66 when the team total was on 219, but Aravinda de Silva and Upul Chandana guided the Sri Lankan team to victory in 41 overs, the former scoring a half century as well.\nThird ODI.\nThe Sri Lankans having won the toss and put the Indians to bat, had them in a difficult position early when both their openers were out with the total on 44. However, Robin Singh and Rahul Dravid built up a strong partnership and took their team to a total of 206 runs, before Dravid was out for 78. Singh had just completed his maiden century when he was dismissed. Azharuddin had become the third batsman to pass 7,000 ODI runs before he was dismissed for 34 with the total on 273. The rest of the batsmen scored low, with the last six wickets being taken by the Sri Lankans in 33 balls while conceding 23 runs. The Indians completed their 50 overs with a score of 291/9.\nContinuing his good form from the previous matches, Jayasuriya knocked a fast 68 at a strike rate of 178.94. The match was interrupted by rain during the eighth over, and after resuming it with a reduced target of 195 in 25 overs, Jayasuriya and Atapattu were dismissed with the score on 85 and 96 respectively. Ranatunga, Mahanama, and Kalpage all lost their wickets early to Robin Singh in their search for quick runs. Aravinda de Silva attempted to salvage the Sri Lankan innings, before he too was dismissed for 22. The Sri Lankan team were on 132/6 when bad light stopped play at about 6.05 pm after 19 overs, possibly denying India the chance of a win. The match was scheduled to be replayed the following day.\nFourth ODI.\nThe Indians won the toss and chose to field, and immediately got themselves in an advantageous position after dismissing both Sri Lankan openers for 3 runs each. However, an 83 run partnership between Roshan Mahanama and Aravinda de Silva took the Sri Lankans out of danger and onto a score of 105, before Mahanama was bowled out for 50. Ranatunga was quickly dismissed as well, but de Silva put up an 82 run stand with Lanka de Silva who made his maiden half century, and scored 114 runs himself. The Sri Lankans were all out for 264 in the last over.\nIndia started well with a 50 run opening partnership with 39 from Sachin Tendulkar. Robin Singh and Rahul Dravid contributed with 28 and 42 respectively. Mohammad Azharuddin and Ajay Jadeja took the Indians to 221 for 4 wickets, but both were then run out, the former with a score of 65. After that, the Sri Lankan team kept their fielding tight and restricted the Indians to a total of 255 at the end of the allotted 50 overs."

        "text": "The New Zealand national cricket team's tour of Sri Lanka in 1992–93 was the second Test cricket series played in Sri Lanka since the previous New Zealand tour of the country had been cut short following the Colombo central bus station bombing in 1987. The tour was almost called off before it had started following a suicide bomb attack which saw the assassination of Vice-Admiral Clancy Fernando and three other naval officers by Tamil separatists. The assassination took place only 50 metres from the team's hotel in Colombo and led to several players returning home.\nThe tour took place in November and December 1992. New Zealand had toured Zimbabwe immediately before flying to Sri Lanka to play three Test matches and three One Day Internationals (ODIs), a series of matches which \"Wisden\" described as being intended as \"a confidence-boosting exercise to develop some of New Zealand's emerging players\". Following the suicide bombing one Test match was cancelled and a number of replacement players joined the tour party. Sri Lanka won the Test series 1–0, with one match drawn, and the ODI series 2–0, with the first ODI ending without a result following heavy rain.\nTour party.\nA fifteen-man squad had been announced on 4 September for both the tour of Zimbabwe and the subsequent tour of Sri Lanka, with the side's established wicket-keeper Ian Smith having retired following the 1992 Cricket World Cup. Before the tour of Zimbabwe began two players, Chris Cairns and Danny Morrison, were replaced due to injuries, with Simon Doull and Mark Haslam called into the side. Doull was injured during the tour of Zimbabwe and was replaced by Chris Pringle for the Sri Lankan leg of the tour. The side was captained by Martin Crowe, with Andrew Jones as vice-captain. The tour manager was Leif Dearsley.\nThe tour party was initially made up of:\nFollowing the bombing in Colombo, which occurred close to the New Zealand team's hotel, the team considered abandoning the tour. A vote initially split the players and Peter McDermott, the chairman of the New Zealand Cricket Board, flew to the country to negotiate with them. \"Wisden\" reported that McDermott was concerned about compensation that would need to be paid to the Sri Lankan Cricket Board if the tour was cancelled and was under pressure from the New Zealand government which wasiaming to improve trade-relations with Sri Lanka. He convinced enough players to continue the tour, although Crowe was critical of the decision and considered that he had been directed to continue as captain against his wishes.\nFive players, Greatbatch, Larsen, Latham, Patel and Watson, chose to leave the tour and return to New Zealand, as did the team coach Warren Lees. They were replaced by Grant Bradburn, Michael Owens, Justin Vaughan and veteran batsman John Wright, who had previously made himself unavailable for the tour. Crowe took over as the main coach for the team. Owens and Vaughan were the only uncapped players on the tour; both made their international debut in the first Test match.\nSri Lanka were captained by Arjuna Ranatunga throughout the tour.\nTour itinerary.\nThe tour was originally scheduled to include three Test matches, with matches due to be played at Kandy from 21 to 26 November, Moratuwa from 5 to 10 December and at Colombo from 12 to 17 December. Following the suicide bombing in Colombo this was reduced to two Tests, with no match played at Kandy and the dates of the other matches on the tour changed. A three-day warm up match which was scheduled to start on 17 November, the day after the bombing, was cancelled and replaced by two one-day matches against a Sri Lankan Cricket Board XI.\nThe New Zealand team flew from Zimbabwe to Singapore before transferring to Sri Lanka.\nTest series.\nThe revised two-match Test series was won 1–0 by Sri Lanka, with the first Test drawn.\nOne Day International series.\nSri Lanka won the series 2-0 with one match ending as no-result."

        "title": "George Wright Golf Course",
        "text": "George Wright Golf Course is a municipal golf course in the Hyde Park and Roslindale neighborhoods of Boston, Massachusetts. The course was designed by Donald Ross, with the construction completed as one of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration (WPA) projects. It represents one of the least known but impressive examples of Ross' breathtaking design art. The course opened in 1938.\nHistory.\nThe course is named for George Wright, a Hall of Fame baseball player with the Boston Red Stockings, along with being one of the leaders of introducing golf to the Boston area in 1890.\nRetired businessman Henry Sturgis Grew purchased several hundred acres of land (which later became known as \"Grew's Woods\") in 1847, in what was then the western section of the town of Dorchester Massachusetts. Grew became a founding father of the Town of Hyde Park, incorporated on April 22, 1868, composed of portions of Dorchester (including Grew's Woods), Dedham and Milton. Grew died in 1892. In 1925 his son Edward Wigglesworth Grew, as trustee of his father's estate, sold of the property through his company Meredith &amp; Grew (now Colliers International) to the Bonelli-Adams Company. The intent was to set aside of this land in order to construct a privately financed golf course, to be designed by Wayne Stiles.\nInstead Donald Ross, the golf course architect who lived in nearby Newton, was commissioned to design the course. Eyeing the terrain, Ross was reported to have shaken his head and said: \"You would need one of two things to build a suitable course on this property. Either a million dollars or an earthquake.\" When the market crashed in 1929 the project was abandoned.\nOn Nov. 6, 1930, the Board of Street Commissioners took the land by eminent domain for recreational purposes, specifically a municipal golf course. The Grew estate was a mix of ledge and swamp, not particularly suitable for building a course, and a good deal of speculation remained whether one could be built. However, despite concerns, construction began in January, 1931.\nIn 1932 Walter Irving Johnson, who had worked for years as an associate of Ross, took on the project as an engineer for the Metropolitan District Commission. During the seven years in which the course and clubhouse were under construction, the work passed from the municipal administration of Mayor James Michael Curley to the federal Civil Works Administration (CWA) and Works Progress Administration (WPA) programs. George Wright became one of the great feats of engineering and building in the annals of golf. Before completion, of dynamite were used to excavate the ledge, of dirt were spread to raise the ground above the swamp level, and of drainage pipe were laid to drain the property. The WPA provided the funds to build the course, estimated at $1,000,000 by completion in 1938. At one time 1,000 men worked on the project.\nBy completion, George Wright sported a full-sized 18-hole golf course, as well as a nearly long stone wall that encircled the entire site. In addition, a Norman-style clubhouse of mammoth proportion was constructed at a cost of $200,000. The course opened to much fanfare on April 23, 1938, with Mayor Maurice J. Tobin driving the opening ball while a WPA band played \"Annie Laurie\", an old Scottish song. The yearly fee for membership was $35, and the daily greens fee was $2.\nIn 1946, Mayor Curley, in his fourth and final term, proposed converting the course into a veterans' housing project.\nDecline.\nBy the 1970s and early 80s, conditions deteriorated due to city budget cuts. Faced with a tax-cutting ballot initiative (Proposition 2½) and possible closure in 1982, the city leased the property to the Massachusetts Golf Association for $1 a year for a period of 8 years. Starting in 1990, the city started receiving 3.5 percent of gross revenues. In 1994, the city's share of profits increased by 1 percentage point to 4.5 percent.\nResurrection.\nAfter decades of contracted management, the City of Boston decided to take over operational control of the facility in 2004. The decision was made to provide the best golf experience possible for the city's residents at an affordable rate. Mark Mungeam was contracted by the City of Boston to renovate the course. Since taking over operations, George Wright has gradually returned to prominence as evidenced by being selected as a MGA Amateur Qualifying Site in 2009.\nFeatures.\nOver half the holes on the course include hills that often cause the golfer to hit blind shots. Somewhat narrow fairways guarded by large numbers of mature trees also make this relatively short course extremely challenging.\nThe hill on the 12th hole approaching the green (the \"Double-decker,\" with the steep face also known as \"Suicide Hill\") has been used for years by locals in the winter as a place for sledding and tobogganing. Despite a death in the mid-1990s in the small pond adjacent to the hill, the City of Boston still permits the practice.\nThe course is open seven days a week from April 1 through November 30, located at 420 West Street in the Hyde Park section of Boston, at approximately where West Street turns into Poplar Street."

        "title": "George Shaw (American football)",
        "text": "George Howard Shaw (July 25, 1933 – January 3, 1998) was an American football quarterback who played seven seasons in the National Football League (NFL) and one season in the rival American Football League (AFL). He was the first overall selection of the 1955 NFL draft by the Baltimore Colts, for whom he started 17 consecutive games. \nA leg injury to Shaw in 1956 forced the Colts to insert free agent backup Johnny Unitas at quarterback, launching the latter on what would become a Hall of Fame career.\nShaw was part of the Colts team which won the 1958 Championship Playoff over the New York Football Giants in sudden death overtime, long regaled in football lore as \"the Greatest Game Ever Played.\"\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nGeorge Shaw was born July 25, 1933, in Portland, Oregon. His father had been the operator of a small chain of four or five grocery stores, which were lost during the financial crisis of the Great Depression. He subsequently worked in the produce business.\nHe attended Grant High School in that city, participating on that school's football team as a quarterback on offense and a defensive back on the other side of the ball. George became the fourth of four Shaw brothers to play football for the Grant team, with his older brother Tom going on to play quarterback for Stanford.\nA reserve during his sophomore season, in 1949 and 1950 Shaw led the Grant Generals to two consecutive Oregon state football championships. The undefeated 1949 team caused one observer to write \"They must go down in the annals as one of the best state championship teams in history — they looked that good.\"\nThe 1949 championship game placed Shaw firmly on the radar of the Oregon Ducks, with the same sports columnist noting: \"Oregon's Jim Aiken sat alongside us during the game and between puffs of a cigar that wouldn't stay lit, Gentleman Jim drooled in ecstasy at the Generals' George Shaw, their brilliant junior quarterback. It will be two years before Jim has a chance to lay his hands on the kid, but you could see Aiken was thinking in terms of 1952, '53, and '54 quite often last Saturday.\"\nShaw and his Grant Generals teammates extended their undefeated streak to 22 games with their defeat of the Marshfield Pirates in the 1950 Oregon state high school championship game held at Multnomah Stadium. Shaw once again starred in the game, highlighted by his 40-yard punt return setting up a 9-yard touchdown pass to end Dick Davenport. Shaw suffered an injury late in the third quarter than severely limited his time on the field for the rest of the contest, but Grant managed to hold on in his absence for a narrow 12–7 victory.\nIn leading Grant to a second straight Oregon championship, Shaw was named to the first team of the 1950 Oregon All-State team. He was also tabbed as a third team High School All-American for 1950.\nCollege career.\nAlthough his early admirer, head coach Jim Aiken, had by then departed, Shaw enrolled at the University of Oregon in 1951. Although generally freshmen were prohibited by NCAA rule from participating in varsity sports, an exception was made in 1951 due to a player shortage associated with the outbreak of the Korean War, so Shaw immediately became a member of the Ducks varsity team. This did not stop Shaw from making his mark, racking up an astounding 13 interceptions as a defensive back for the year — an NCAA record for a 10-game season that would stand for 17 years.\nShaw gained a reputation as a good sport in a violent game, earning him the nickname \"Gentleman George\" from his teammates. He would frequently help opponents to their feet after a tackle and would very properly address officials as \"Mr. Referee.\"\nAs a senior in 1954, Shaw led the Ducks to their first winning record since 1948. For the year, Shaw went 91-for-196 (46.4%) passing, with 10 touchdowns, while rushing for three more. His 196 pass attempts were the most in the nation. He finished 8th in balloting for the 1954 Heisman Trophy and won the Pop Warner Trophy as the most valuable senior football player on the Pacific coast.\nShaw was named a 1954 All-American by the Associated Press and Newspaper Enterprise Association, which named him to their third teams, and United Press International, which assigned him second team status. He was also named a member of the All-Pacific Coast Conference team in both 1953 and 1954.\nHe was also a star baseball player at Oregon, with some prospect of a professional career in that sport.\nProfessional career.\nBeginning in 1947, the National Football League (NFL) conducted a lottery of its members for the right to select the first overall player in that year's draft. Teams winning this special drawing were to be ineligible from winning the choice again in subsequent years. In 1955 it was the turn of the Baltimore Colts to win the top pick, as their slip was selected over those of the Chicago Cardinals, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Green Bay Packers.\nThe Colts used their windfall pick to make Shaw the first player chosen in the 1955 NFL Draft. Colts head coach Weeb Ewbank called Shaw \"the best quarterback available in the country\" and noted that in addition to his passing and rushing prowess, the versatile Oregon star had shown himself to be \"an excellent defensive player. Joining Shaw as the Colts' first round selection was Wisconsin fullback Alan Ameche, who would long play a starring role for the team.\nA parade of NFL owners made their way to the Colts' table at the draft to make offers for one or both of the top Baltimore picks, since both players had been near the top of most teams' draft list. Coming off a year in which the Colts had finished last in points scored and yards gained, team owner Carroll Rosenbloom quickly put a halt to these efforts to raid his new offensive prospects, however, announcing to the meeting that no such deals would be considered. \nShaw did not rush to come to contract terms with the Colts, however, instead carefully weighing the alternative of signing a professional baseball contract to play as an outfielder for the Boston Red Sox. Despite Colts team president \"Red\" Kellett flying to the west coast in an effort to obtain Shaw's signature on a contract, Shaw remained insistent on continuing to play baseball through the spring of 1955 with the Oregon Ducks, who had won the pennant for the Northern Division of the Pacific Coast Conference and held hopes of advancing to the College World Series.\nThe impasse was finally broken on June 16, when Shaw signed a contract to play with the Colts for the 1955 season. Financial terms of the deal were not announced to the press, although permission was granted by the club for Shaw to continue to play baseball for a time if such an opportunity presented itself. The only proviso was that Shaw agreed to report to training camp in Maryland for its scheduled opening on July 16.\nShaw subsequently told Colts publicity director John Steadman that his choice of football over baseball had been practical rather than financial. \"I'm going to have to go in the Army in 1957,\" he said. \"I didn't think it made good logic for me to become a bonus player in baseball, sit on the bench for two years and then go in the service. I would have wasted two years. This way, in football, if I'm lucky, I'll gain in experience these two years and I may be better established.\"\nAlthough playing rookies in key positions was not typical for head coach Weeb Ewbank, Shaw was quickly made the Colts' starter at quarterback. He generated great excitement among the fanbase by leading the Colts to three straight victories to launch the 1955 Baltimore Colts season. The winning streak was ended in a Week 4 game against the Chicago Bears, in which Shaw suffered a crushing hit that broke his facemask, nose, and knocked out four teeth. Team trainers came up with some chewing gum that was used to fashion a crude mouthpiece, allowing Shaw to again take the field for the remainder of the team's losing effort.\nShaw finished his rookie season having started 12 of the Colts' 14 games. He ranked statistically in the middle of the league's quarterbacks, passing for 1,586 yards and 10 touchdowns while finishing second in the NFL for quarterback rushing, gaining 301 yards en route to 3 more touchdowns.\nOn October 21, 1956, in a game against the Chicago Bears in Chicago, Shaw suffered a broken leg and was replaced by undrafted rookie backup Johnny Unitas. As Unitas embarked on his legendary career, Shaw lasted two more years in Baltimore as the backup before being traded to the New York Giants, where he played two seasons.\nShaw played one season with the Minnesota Vikings, where he started the first game in franchise history but was replaced in the first half by rookie backup Fran Tarkenton who took over the starting job.\nHe also played one season with the Denver Broncos of the American Football League before retiring from football in 1962.\nLife after football.\nAfter his time in football, Shaw returned to his native Portland where he worked in a stock brokerage firm, rising to the position of vice president.\nDeath and legacy.\nShaw died at his home in Portland on January 3, 1998, after a long struggle with bone marrow cancer. He was 64 years old at the time of his death. Family members said he died peacefully in his sleep.\nIn his 1987 memoir, Art Donovan, his Hall of Fame teammate on the Colts, testified to Shaw's toughness: \"In 1955, we had George Shaw at quarterback. George wasn't a big guy, but he was talented, a lot like Francis Tarkenton. We were playing the Bears out in Chicago, and Shaw took a mighty rap as he dropped back to pass. Ed Sprinkle, a grizzly old defensive end...broke through and hit Shaw low. Sprinkle kind of had him around the knees and was holding him up... [A]s Sprinkle was keeping him upright, linebacker George Connor got about a fifteen-yard head of steam up and bulled through and hit George high, right in the mouth. I mean put a shoulder right in his face and leveled him. Connor broke Shaw's face mask, broke his nose, and knocked his teeth out. George was a mess. They dragged him off the field, and his nose was spurting blood, and he didn't know where he was when he got to the bench... When George finally regained his senses, he said to Dick Szymanski, 'Hey Syzzie, how do my teeth look?' And Syzzie said, 'I don't know, George — they aren't there.' And you know what? George Shaw went back into that game. There was at least one fat defensive tackle on the Baltimore sidelines that gained a lot of respect for him that day.\""

        "text": "Merion Cricket Club is a private club which is located in Haverford, Pennsylvania. It was founded in 1865.\nThe current clubhouse is its sixth, the last four having been designed by Philadelphia architect Frank Furness and his partner, Allen Evans, who was also a founder of the club.\nThe club was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987 for its leading role in the promotion, development and continued support of cricket, golf, squash, and tennis in the United States.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded in October 1865 by William Woodrow Montgomery and Marshall Ewing. Its first meeting was held at Glenays, the home of William Woodrow Montgomery, on December 16, 1865. While there was some thought of converting into a baseball club due to a lack of a permanent facility, its first cricket match was held in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, May 19, 1866.\nFrom 1873 to 1892, the club occupied grounds in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, before moving to its present grounds in Haverford. The first tennis match was held in 1881; the first golf course was laid out in 1896, with other courses in 1912 and 1914.\nFrom 1900 to 1934 and 1937 to 1941, the club hosted the NCAA Division I men's tennis championships.\nFacilities.\nThe first clubhouse (1865–73) was an existing house in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, on land owned by Col. Owen Jones. The second (1873–80) was an industrial building in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, about a mile southeast of the current grounds. The third (1880–92), by Furness &amp; Evans, on Cricket Avenue in Ardmore, was destroyed by fire in 1892. The fourth (1892–96), at the present location, although backing onto Montgomery Avenue, was destroyed by fire in January 1896. The fifth (1896), backing onto Grays Lane, was destroyed by fire before its completion. The sixth (and present) clubhouse was built to the same plan as the fifth but in stone and brick. Alexander Cassatt, a vice-president of the Pennsylvania Railroad (later PRR president), paid for the fireproof clubhouse.\nOn the club grounds there are indoor and outdoor tennis courts, paddle tennis courts, singles and doubles squash courts, a bowling alley, dining facilities and a ballroom. Seasonally, the club has croquet and cricket events.\nThe Club also fields a football (association football) team known as the Merion C.C. Football Club. The team competes annually for The Manheim Prize, the oldest amateur soccer trophy in the United States.\nThe Club's tennis and squash facilities have been host to many historically significant national and international championships.\nMerion Golf Club.\nIn 1896 members of the Merion Cricket Club founded the Merion Golf Club which has hosted the U.S. Open five times, for the first time in 1934. In 1941, this became a separate club. The Merion Golf Club most recently hosted the U.S. Open in 2013."

        "title": "Jim Campbell (baseball executive)",
        "text": "James Arthur Campbell (February 5, 1924 – October 31, 1995) was an American Major League Baseball executive. He worked for the Detroit Tigers for 43 seasons from 1949 to 1992. He was the team's general manager from September 1962 to September 1983, its president from August 1978 to January 1990, and its chairman from January 1990 to August 1992. The Tigers won two World Series championships (1968 and 1984) during Campbell's tenure with the club. He was selected as the Major League Baseball executive of the year in 1968 and was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 1985.\nEarly years.\nCampbell was born in 1924 in Huron, Ohio, and played four sports at Huron High School. His father died after being injured in an electrical accident while Campbell was still in high school. Campbell enrolled at Ohio State University in 1942 and played freshman football. He served in the United States Navy Air Corps from 1943 to 1946 before returning to Ohio State. He played as an outfielder for the Ohio State Buckeyes baseball team for three years before graduating in 1949 with a bachelor's degree in commerce.\nDetroit Tigers.\nCampbell joined the Tigers organization in 1949 as the business manager of the Class D (equivalent to Rookie-level today) Thomasville Tigers in Thomasville, Georgia. The stadium in Thomasville burned to the ground after the first game of Campbell's tenure. Campbell gained praise for keeping the team playing with borrowed uniforms and overseeing the prompt reconstruction of the stadium.\nCampbell was promoted to business manager of the Tigers' farm system in 1952. In 1957, Campbell became the major-league team's business manager, and in 1959 he became a vice president. In September 1962, at age 38, he became the team's general manager. \nNotable moves and accomplishments during Campbell's tenure as the Tigers' general manager include the following:\nIn August 1978, he was promoted to team president. However, he had been operating head of the franchise for some time before then. Owner John Fetzer had been nominal team president since 1961, but mostly left the team in Campbell's hands and rarely interfered.\nIn February 1982, Campbell underwent heart bypass surgery, and he was hospitalized briefly in August 1983 after experiencing dizziness. In September 1983, and acting on his doctor's advice, Campbell stepped down as general manager, turning over that role to longtime assistant Bill Lajoie. However, he remained as the club's president.\nIn February 1985, Campbell was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame. In January 1990, Campbell, at age 65, stepped down as the Tigers' president; former Michigan Wolverines football coach Bo Schembechler replaced him. (Schembechler had retired from Michigan weeks earlier.) Campbell remained as chairman and chief executive officer and continued to maintain an office at Tiger Stadium. After owner Tom Monaghan agreed to sell the team to Mike Ilitch, Monaghan fired both Campbell and Schembechler in August 1992.\nFamily and later years.\nCampbell was married in 1954 to Helene Grace Mulligan of Lakewood, Ohio. They were divorced in 1969. Campbell later blamed his devotion to the Tigers for the divorce. He recalled in 1989: \"I've worked for this club for 40 years, and I've had very few days off. I'm talking about weekends and everything.\"\nAfter being fired in 1992, Campbell did not return to Tiger Stadium. In October 1995, he suffered a heart attack in Lakeland, Florida, and died at the Lakeland Regional Health Medical Center at age 71."

        "title": "2007 Giro d'Italia",
        "text": "The 2007 Giro d'Italia was the 90th running of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It took place from 12 May to 3 June 2007. The race began in Sardinia and finished in Milan, and featured five mountain top finishes, of which one was an individual time trial. The race also visited France and Austria in three stages.\nDanilo Di Luca of the team won the race, with Andy Schleck from and Eddy Mazzoleni from rounding out the podium. Schleck also won the youth classification, which featured in the Giro for the first time since 1994. Di Luca's team dominated the overall classification, holding the race leader's pink jersey for 17 of the 21 stages.\nDuring the race, Alessandro Petacchi tested positive for elevated levels of salbutamol at a doping control on 23 May, after winning Stage 11. Petacchi has a medical exemption to use salbutamol in the treatment of asthma, but the concentration of the drug in his urine sample from this control was above the therapeutically accepted level. Though the Italian Cycling Federation originally refused to punish him, the Italian National Olympic Committee appealed the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, resulting in a suspension for the rider and forfeiture of all his results from the Giro.\nTeams.\nThe Giro, along with the season's other Grand Tours (the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España), was one of several events run in 2007 as a UCI ProTour event but without a ProTour license. This meant that while ProTour points were awarded in the race, the organizers were not obligated to invite the 20 ProTour teams. Nineteen of the twenty ProTour teams, being the exception, were invited, with three UCI Professional Continental teams rounding out the event's 22-team peloton. Each team entered nine riders, so the race began with 198 in total.\nThe 22 teams who took part in the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nIn the months leading up to the Giro, headlines centered on defending champion Ivan Basso. After having been removed from 's start list for the 2006 Tour de France due to his apparent involvement in the Operación Puerto doping case, Basso and Team CSC mutually agreed on the termination of his contract with them. Days later, Basso appeared to be cleared of any connection to Puerto, as the Italian Cycling Federation (FCI) shelved his case, and he signed with . He rode part of the 2007 season with Discovery, and had intended to seek overall victory both in this Giro and in the 2007 Tour de France with his new team. In April 2007, Basso's case was re-opened by the FCI, a step rarely taken on cases formally shelved. Facing further investigations into his involvement with the doping ring, team Discovery asked him to stop racing late in April. Shortly afterward, just two weeks before the Giro was to begin, Basso terminated his contract with Discovery, meaning the Giro started without its defending champion. Basso subsequently admitted to planning on doping in the 2006 Tour, and the FCI handed him a two-year suspension, with credit for time already served in 2006 after he was first connected to the doping ring. Paolo Bettini, the reigning world champion, wore bib number one in Basso's place.\nBasso's removal left wide open the possibilities for overall victory in this Giro. Four former Giro winners started this race – Damiano Cunego, Paolo Savoldelli, Gilberto Simoni, and Stefano Garzelli – and they were expected to be among the favorites. Simoni's team was noted to contain many strong climbers, including Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli. The passage of the Giro over Monte Zoncolan, where Simoni won a stage en route to overall victory in the 2003 Giro d'Italia, was also noted as a factor in his favor. Classics specialist Danilo Di Luca of was also named as a contender, chiefly because of his strong team. Further riders named as contenders included Pietro Caucchioli and Yaroslav Popovych.\nThe most high-profile sprinters lined up to begin the 2007 Giro were Alessandro Petacchi and Robbie McEwen. They, along with countrymen Mario Cipollini and Baden Cooke, had had a back-and-forth rivalry for sprinting supremacy that had gone back several years but had been stunted in 2006 when Petacchi missed most of the season, including all but the first three stages of the Giro, due to a fractured kneecap sustained from a crash. One pre-race analysis viewed Petacchi's 2007 Giro and season as a chance at redemption for him. Other fast men in the race noted to be contenders in the flat stages included two-time points classification winner Bettini, Danilo Napolitano, and Graeme Brown.\nRoute and stages.\nRace director Angelo Zomegnan commented that the route was designed to be easier than that of the extremely climbing-intensive 2006 Giro. The Giro's twenty-one stages were divided into the following classifications: three time trials (one team and two individual), eleven flat or undulating stages (officially there was no distinction made between flat and undulating), four intermediate stages, and three mountain stages. The race began with a team time trial on the island of Sardinia. This was followed by two flat stages and an unusually early rest day to transfer from Sardinia to Italy's mainland. The riders transferred by plane while the Giro caravan, race officials and team cars made the trip by boat. The final stage, as was tradition, was a flat, mostly ceremonial road stage to Milan, finishing with ten circuits on the Corso Venezia of the Via Montenapoleone.\nThere were three stages that began or ended outside Italy. Stage 12, the first high mountain stage, ended at the French city Briançon, a frequent destination for the Tour de France. The 16th stage ended at Lienz in Austria, and the 17th began there.\nFive stages ended with climbs. Stage 4, the first intermediate stage, ended at Montevergine di Mercogliano at . The tenth stage, also classified intermediate, had a less imposing final climb of , but it was nonetheless expected to change the race's overall standings as it was very long it had numerous small climbs. Stage 13 was a climbing time trial, to Santuario di Oropa at , with gradients on the climb reaching as high as 13%. Two stages later was perhaps the race's most difficult stage, featuring four major climbs and ending at at Tre Cime di Lavaredo. The last mountaintop arrival was in the seventeenth stage, and featured one of the hardest climbs in the world, Monte Zoncolan. Though the summit of this climb was lesser than some other peaks visited in the race, at , its gradients were crushing, with the steepest stretches reaching over 20% incline. Though the number of mountain stages was small, it was nonetheless expected that it would take a strong climber to win the race.\nRace overview.\nThe Giro began with a team time trial on the island of Sardinia. The winning team was , but due to unusual stage-ending tactics, it was Enrico Gasparotto and not team leader Danilo Di Luca who took the first pink jersey. Gasparotto faced intense questioning from his teammates and the media after not yielding first position to his team's captain, as is usual practice in a team time trial. Gasparotto yielded the jersey to Di Luca after stage 2, when Di Luca finished higher-placed in the mass finish, but took it back again after stage 3 when he contested the sprint and finished eighth. Finally, after stage 4, the six-way tie involving the Liquigas riders who finished together in the team time trial was broken, as Di Luca won the stage into Montevergine and took the pink jersey again.\nDi Luca held the race lead until the conclusion of stage 6, which was decided by a breakaway. Luis Felipe Laverde and Marco Pinotti were the last members of a five-man morning breakaway still together at the finish. Since Pinotti started the day better-placed in the overall classification and became the new race leader because of their time gap over the peloton, he allowed Laverde to take the stage win. Laverde took the green jersey as mountains classification leader after the stage. The next three stages were flat and contested among sprinters and breakaways. This meant Pinotti was able to maintain his race lead with little difficulty, until stage 10, the Giro's next intermediate stage. The race's overall contenders showed themselves on this stage, with Leonardo Piepoli putting in a decisive attack from the summit of the Santuario Nostra Signora della Guardia to claim victory by 19 seconds over Di Luca. Pinotti finished more than four minutes back, and surrendered the pink jersey to Di Luca's teammate Andrea Noè, who was tenth on the stage. At age 38, Noè was the oldest rider in the Giro and the oldest ever to lead a Grand Tour. Di Luca took the green jersey after this stage, his second stint in the \"maglia verde\" to go along with his two in pink. 's Andy Schleck took the white jersey after this stage by finishing third, after Di Luca passed him for second in the final kilometer.\nStage 12 into Briançon in France was the Giro's first high mountain stage, and it shook up the standings for the final time. Di Luca took the stage win, twice attacking from an elite group of five that had made the climb together. As Noè finished nearly ten minutes behind, Di Luca took the pink jersey for a third time, while still holding the green jersey. As Di Luca concentrated on winning the race overall, Piepoli took the green jersey after stage 15, the race's queen stage, topping two of that stage's climbs in first position. His lead in the mountains classification quickly became unassailable, and he won the jersey in Milan. It was also on this stage that 's Eddy Mazzoleni distinguished himself as a podium contender, taking a minute and a half out of Di Luca to move into second overall. Schleck lost time to Di Luca and Mazzoleni, but gained time over other riders in the top of the overall standings and stood third overall.\nThe last minor change to the top of the overall standings took place during stage 17, to Monte Zoncolan. The stage itself was conquered by the duo of Gilberto Simoni and Piepoli. Since the climb had personal significance for Simoni, having won a stage there four years earlier, his teammate allowed him to cross the line first. Schleck, for his part, was third, just seven seconds back, and gained over two minutes against Mazzoleni to move up to the second step of the podium. Mazzoleni fell to fifth on this stage, but returned to the podium after the race's final time trial. Mazzoleni's teammate Paolo Savoldelli won the stage by a comfortable margin, but Mazzoleni took back nearly all the time he had lost on the Zoncolan stage and finished the race third overall. Di Luca was not seriously challenged after taking the race lead in stage 12, and comfortably won the Giro in Milan with a two-minute gap over Schleck in second.\nDi Luca's team Liquigas was dominant. They took three stage wins, two with Di Luca himself to go along with the race's opening team time trial, and held the pink jersey for all but four days. With Alessandro Petacchi's disqualification (see below), Saunier Duval-Prodir took the most stage wins. Three of their victories came in the high mountains, with Piepoli, Riccò, and Simoni all winning high-profile stages. Iban Mayo added a breakaway win in Stage 18. team leader Stefano Garzelli, a former Giro winner, also won two stages. Danilo Napolitano and Marzio Bruseghin both took wins for , and four other teams were single stage winners. The teams classifications and the classifications which awarded jerseys were all won by teams who had won stages, meaning eight of the 22 teams in the race took significant victories.\nDoping cases.\nThe most noteworthy doping case from the 2007 Giro involved sprinter Alessandro Petacchi. Petacchi took five stage wins, but after the third of them, he tested non-negative for salbutamol, an asthma medication which Petacchi has a medical exemption to use. Petacchi was obligated as the stage winner to give a urine sample to the doping authorities, and it had a concentration of 1,352 nanograms per milliliter of salbutamol, above the 1,000 allowed by the medical exemption. Salbutamol has anabolic effects at high concentrations. Team Milram placed Petacchi on immediate provisional suspension following the Giro, which kept him from participating in the Tour de France later that season as he had planned. The Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) asked the Italian Cycling Federation (FCI) for a one-year ban for Petacchi.\nThe FCI refused to suspend Petacchi, and he returned to racing in late July. Their decision, however, was not made to exonerate Petacchi, but rather because they did not believe they should hear the case, instead deferring to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The CAS heard the case, and Petacchi testified to the court, stating that the hot and humid day on which the stage was the run had made it so that he took several extra puffs from his inhaler, but that this was accidental and that most had come after he had already crossed the finish line and won the stage.\nIn its decision, the CAS ruled that Petacchi had likely not intended to cheat, but that he had not exercised the \"utmost caution\" it deemed necessary to abide by doping rules. Petacchi was suspended for a year, minus the time he had already sat out after Team Milram first provisionally suspended him, and his results from the Giro were all stripped. Team Milram subsequently fired Petacchi, and he was without a team until late in the 2008 season. While the court's decision explicitly stripped Petacchi of his results from this race, it does not seem that it granted those victories retroactively to other riders.\nPetacchi was not the only rider identified as giving a non-negative doping test during the Giro. Reports emerged in June that three riders were under suspicion of doping, later identified as Petacchi, Leonardo Piepoli, and Iban Mayo. Petacchi and Piepoli both gave tests showing elevated levels of salbutamol, while Mayo's had abnormally high testosterone levels. Mayo was quickly cleared, as further testing revealed that his testosterone levels were of natural origin and that his team had informed the UCI of this. Though Piepoli's level of salbutamol was, at 1,800 nanograms per milliliter, even higher than Petacchi's, he was cleared by his national federation of any doping charges in August.\nGiro champion Danilo Di Luca also gave an irregular doping test, after stage 17 to Monte Zoncolan. The test, given spontaneously hours after the routine test Di Luca gave for being race leader at the time, reportedly showed hormone levels like \"those of a child,\" causing anti-doping authorities to suspect that Di Luca was using some means to cover the presence of banned substances. These unusual levels were not present in the routine test, leading to suspicions that Di Luca had received an autologous blood transfusion between the two tests. A CONI commission later cleared Di Luca on the basis of insufficient evidence to conclude that he had doped.\nMayo and Piepoli would both test positive for erythropoietin later in their careers at the Tour de France, and Di Luca likewise at the 2009 Giro d'Italia, all leading to lengthy suspensions, while Petacchi made a successful return to top-level cycling and to the Giro in 2009.\nClassification leadership.\nIn the 2007 Giro d'Italia, four different jerseys were awarded. For the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass start stages, the leader received a pink jersey. This classification is considered the most important of the Giro d'Italia, and the winner is considered the winner of the Giro.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a mauve jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage. The stage win awarded 25 points, second place awarded 20 points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point less per place down the line, to a single point for 15th. In addition, some points could be won in intermediate sprints.\nThere was also a mountains classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching the top of a mountain before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized, either first, second, or third category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The highest point in the Giro (called the \"Cima Coppi\"), which in 2007 was the Colle dell'Agnello in stage 12, afforded still more points than the other first-category climbs.\nThe fourth was the young rider classification, which awarded a white jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born on or after 1 January 1982 were eligible. This classification was featured in the Giro in 2007 for the first time since 1994.\nThere were also two classifications for teams. The first was the Trofeo Fast Team. In this classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage are added, and the team with the lowest time is leading team. The Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification, with the top 20 placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run. A year after the race, Alessandro Petacchi was stripped of all his results; this table reflects the stages and jersey awards he originally won.\nFinal standings.\nMinor classifications.\nOther less well-known classifications were awarded during the Giro, whose leaders did not receive a special jersey. These awards were based on points earned throughout the three weeks of the tour. Each mass start stage had one intermediate sprint, awarding points to the \"Traguardo Volante Garibaldi\" classification. These sprints gave bonus seconds towards the general classification, points towards the regular points classification, and also points towards the \"Traguardo Volante Garibaldi\". This award was known in previous years as the Intergiro, and was previously time-based, awarding a blue jersey. rider Mikhail Ignatiev won this classification.\nAdditional minor classifications included the combativity classification, which was a compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes. Alessandro Petacchi was the original winner, but with all his 2007 Giro results forfeited, it appears there is no official winner of this award. The Azzurri d'Italia classification was based on finishing order, but points were awarded only to the top three finishers in each stage. Petacchi originally won this as well.\nAlso, the \"Trofeo Fuga Gilera\" rewarded riders who took part in a breakaway at the head of the field, each rider in an escape of ten or fewer riders getting one point for each kilometre that the group stays clear. Along with the \"Traguardo Volante Garibadli\", Mikhail Ignatiev also finished first in this classification. Teams were given penalty points for minor technical infringements. was not assessed any penalties, and so was the winner of the Fair Play classification."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in South Africa in 1993–94",
        "text": "The Australia national cricket team toured South Africa from February to April 1994 and played a three-match Test series against the South Africa national cricket team. The tour was Australia's first to South Africa since the end of the apartheid regime which had led to a sporting boycott of the country. Australia's most recent tour to South Africa had taken place in 1969–70 and a planned tour of the country in 1971–72 had been cancelled after the International Cricket Conference had imposed a moratorium on tours in 1970 and following the player withdrawals and protests which accompanied the tour of Australia by the South African rugby union side during 1971. The Australian Cricket Board postponed their proposed tour of Sri Lanka in order to schedule the series, paying A$50,000 compensation to the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka.\nThe tour, which was described as \"momentous in many senses\" and \"a big success on and off the field\", immediately followed a tour of Australia by South Africa, an unusual occurrence which \"Wisden\" called into question. A total of 170,000 spectators watched the Test matches whilst 157,000 people attended the ODIs.\nThe teams were considered evenly matched with \"two top quality pace attacks, high standards of fielding, and a level of on-field hostility\" between them. After three warm-up matches, the tour began with four One Day Internationals (ODI) played between 19 and 24 February before the first Test began on 4 March. The Test matches were played throughout March before another four ODIs were played between 2 and 8 April. Both series were halved; the Test series was drawn 1–1, mirroring the result in the preceding tour of Australia, and the eight-match ODI series was drawn 4–4.\nThe first Test match of the series saw two incidents where Australian players were fined 10% of their match fee for verbal abuse of opponents and was the first in which a TV umpire was used to rule on all line decisions, although communication difficulties and a lack of cameras created problems with the implementation of this innovation.\nTour party.\nThe Australian team was captained by Allan Border. It included the uncapped Matthew Hayden who made his Test debut in the first Test of the series. At the end of the series, Border, having achieved his ambition of captaining Australia in South Africa, retired from international cricket aged 38. Dean Jones, who did not play in any of the Test matches on the tour, also retired from international cricket at the end of the series. Bowler Damien Fleming was included for the ODI portions of the tour only, with Merv Hughes not considered for these matches.\nThe South African team was captained by Kepler Wessels who had recovered from an injury sustained during the tour of Australia. Wessels was named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1995.\nTest series.\nThe three Test series was played between 4 and 29 March. Australian Steve Waugh was named the player of the series.\nFirst Test.\nThe first Test was held at Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg. Australian batsman Matthew Hayden made his Test debut, deputising for Mark Taylor who was taken ill on the morning of the match. South Africa won the toss and chose to bat first on a \"cracked\" pitch that the Australian side thought would deteriorate and favour spin bowling towards the end of the match. After recovering from 126/6, the hosts scored a \"respectable\" 251 in their first innings. Australia were bowled out for 248 runs in their first innings to leave the match balanced, only South Africa's Jonty Rhodes scoring a half-century in either first innings.\nThe South African second innings saw Andrew Hudson, Peter Kirsten and Kepler Wessels all make half-centuries and Hansie Cronje score 122 runs, his second career Test century. They declared after scoring a total of 450/9, leaving Australia with a world-record target of 458 runs to win the match with 133 overs remaining. Hayden's thumb was broken by South African fast bowler Allan Donald and the Australians were bowled out for a total of 256 runs, despite a last wicket stand which lasted an hour with the threat of rain looming.\nThe match included several instances of verbal abuse of South African batsmen by Australian bowlers. Fast bowler Merv Hughes was reported to the match referee Donald Carr for continued abuse of a number of batsmen and was fined 10% of his match fee by Carr. Hughes responded to taunts by South African spectators by \"lunging at the offenders with his bat\" in the uncovered player's tunnel and later received a suspended fine of A$4,000 from the Australian Cricket Board (ACB). Spin bowler Shane Warne confronted Andrew Hudson after taking his wicket in South Africa's second innings and had to be restrained by wicket-keeper Ian Healy. The incident was described as \"disgraceful\" and \"almost unprecedented\". Writing in \"Wisden\", Jack Bannister was of the opinion that a \"worse example of misbehaviour it would be difficult to imagine\" and that \"rarely on a cricket field has physical violence seemed so close\". Warne was fined 10% of his match fee and fined A$4,000 by the ACB. Border also clashed with South African bowler Brian McMillan during the match.\nSecond Test.\nThe second Test was played on a slow pitch with low bounce at Newlands Cricket Ground in Cape Town. South Africa chose to bat first and scored 361 in their first innings, with opener Andrew Hudson scoring 102 runs, his second Test match century. In reply Australia made 435 in hours; a first innings lead of 74 on a slow scoring pitch that looked like it would lead to a draw.\nThe match was changed on the evening of the fourth day when South Africa lost four wickets for three runs, including the run out of captain Kepler Wessels which was referred to the third umpire for review using television footage. Steve Waugh was influential in the South African collapse, taking the wicket of Hansie Cronje caught and bowled before taking Hudson's wicket. Waugh finished the innings with five wickets for 25 runs, his best bowling in Test cricket and his third five-wicket haul in Test matches. South Africa were all out for 164 on the final morning, leaving a target of 91 for Australia to make which they achieved before tea on the final day.\nThird Test.\nThe third Test, at Kingsmead Cricket Ground in Durban, ended in a draw to leave the series tied at 1–1. South Africa chose to bowl first on a pitch described as \"hard and grassy\" which was expected to favour the South African fast bowling attack. After bowling Australia out for 269 the South Africans scored 422 in their first innings, but took almost 14 hours to do so. \"Wisden\" called the tactics of batting so slowly \"baffling\" and the time taken to compile their total meant that South Africa were unable to bowl Australia out again, the tourists finishing the match on 297/4 with Mark Waugh on 113 not out after Michael Slater had scored 95 runs. The final partnership of Waugh and Australian captain Allan Border, playing in his final Test match, lasted for more than three hours to save the game.\nOne Day International series.\nA total of eight One Day Internationals were played during the tour, four before the Test series and four after it. The series was tied at four wins for each side. The matches which were played over 50 overs. Australia's Steve Waugh was named player of the series, repeating his success of the Test series.\nPre-Test series matches.\nThe first set of four ODIs were played between 19 and 24 February. South Africa won the first match by five runs after the penultimate over, bowled by Fanie de Villiers, restricted the Australians to just one run from it with the loss of Allan Border's wicket. The over, made up of six yorkers, was described by \"Wisden\" as \"one of the best-ever penultimate overs in a one day international\". An innings of 97 by Hansie Cronje and one described as \"violent, even by his standards\" by Adrian Kuiper who added 47 runs in 22 balls, led South Africa to an easy win in the second match of the series the following day.\nAustralia won the third match before being bowled out for 154 in the last match before the Test series began and losing by seven wickets in another easy South African victory.\nPost-Test series matches.\nThe second set of ODIs were played as day/night matches under floodlit conditions. South African fast bowler Allan Donald was rested for the remaining matches after playing in each of the Test matches. Australia won the first of the second set of matches, reading a slow, turning pitch more effectively than the South African team and selecting two specialist spin bowlers whilst their opponents retained a bowling attack made up solely of fast bowlers.\nIn the sixth match a floodlight failure during the Australian innings meant that they had to bat with a reduced level of light after South Africa had made 227/6. After losing their first seven wickets for 77 runs, bowlers Paul Reiffel and Shane Warne both scored half centuries for Australia and came close to winning the match for their side, a close run out of Warne towards the end of the Australian innings clinching the match for South Africa. The partnership of 118 between the two players set a new record for the eighth wicket in an ODI.\nThe series was poised at 4–2 in South Africa's favour after the match, but Australia won both the remaining fixtures to level the series. Despite a poor start in the seventh match, Mark Taylor and Mark Waugh put on 123 for the Australian's third wicket and South Africa fell behind the run rate to lose the match. The final match came down to the final over. Australia had scored 203/6 and, with 41 overs bowled, South Africa required just 46 runs from the remaining overs. Six were required from the final over, bowled by Damien Fleming who was playing his first match of the tour; South Africa scored just four, with a run out off the final ball of the series meaning that Australia won the match by one run, levelling the ODI series at 4–4 with an \"improbable victory\".\nOther matches.\nAs well as the internationals, three first-class matches and two other matches were played during the tour The tour began with a friendly one-day match against NF Oppenheimer's XI, followed by a first-class match against Northern Transvaal and a one-day match against a representative side. Before the first Test match Australia played a first-class match against Orange Free State and between the first and second Tests they played Boland."

Prior to the series, India toured South Africa in the 1992–93 season, losing the Test series 0–1. India was led by Sachin Tendulkar while South Africa was led by Hansie Cronje. The series was Tendulkar's first overseas Test tour as captain and third overall. The tour began with a Test series (named Castle Lager Series for sponsorship reasons), consisting of three matches. South Africa won the first two matches by a huge margin, thereby winning the series 2–0, while the final Test ended in a draw. At the end of the series, Brian McMillan of South Africa emerged as the top run-scorer with 296 runs, with an average of 98.66. He was closely followed by fellow team member Daryl Cullinan with 291 runs and India's Rahul Dravid (277 runs). Allan Donald and Javagal Srinath finished the series as top wicket-takers capturing 20 and 18 wickets respectively. The former was named \"man of the series\".\nThe Test series was followed by a triangular One-Day tournament, which included Zimbabwe as the third team. South Africa won all its round-robin matches, and played against India in the finals; they defeated India by 17 runs to win the title. Donald once again ended up as the leading wicket-taker in the tournament with 18 wickets, while Cronje was declared \"man of the series\".\nSquads.\nThe South Africa squad announced for the first two Tests excluded regulars Jonty Rhodes, Fanie de Villiers and Pat Symcox. Rhodes was omitted owing to an injury and concerns over suitability of his form for Test cricket, Symcox over the use of two spinners on bouncy wickets; Paul Adams made the team, while de Villiers' exclusion went unexplained by the team management. Derek Crookes, Nicky Boje, John Commins, who were members of the team's tour of India earlier that season, were also excluded. Shaun Pollock, who missed his made the squad upon recovering from a heel injury. Jacques Kallis was also included alongside uncapped Transvaal player Adam Bacher. Their ODI squad was announced on 20 January 1997. Rhodes was recalled to the side following good performances for Natal in the domestic circuit. After good performances in the Test series, Kallis was recalled. After the squad was announced, Brian McMillan ruled out with an inflamed tendon in his left foot; Craig Matthews was named as his replacement. Matthews injured his ankle during the second game and was replaced by Rudi Bryson.\nA 16-member India squad was announced for the Test series. Sachin Tendulkar was retained as the captain; Sunil Dev was named manager for the tour. Navjot Singh Sidhu and Vinod Kambli were not considered for selection due to disciplinary reasons, while Ajay Jadeja, Sunil Joshi, Wasim Jaffer, Sanjay Manjrekar and Abey Kuruvilla were left out from the squad. Overall, four seam bowlers and two spinners made the squad. However, the inclusion of three wicket-keepers including uncapped player Pankaj Dharmani attracted criticism. Jadeja and Joshi were later brought in for the triangular ODI series, along with Robin Singh and Salil Ankola, who replaced Dharmani, David Johnson, Venkatapathy Raju and Woorkeri Raman of the Test side.\nTest matches.\n1st Test.\nAfter India won the toss and elected to field first, South Africa were bowled out for 235 runs. India managed just 100 runs in their first innings. South Africa in their second innings made 259, setting a target of 395 for India. India ended up scoring 66 runs, their fourth lowest total in Tests, thereby losing the match by 328 runs.\n3rd Test.\nSouth Africa appealed for bad light and escaped defeat."

        "title": "New Zealand cricket team in South Africa in 1994–95",
        "text": "The New Zealand national cricket team toured South Africa from November 1994 to January 1995 and played a three-match Test series against the South Africa national cricket team. The tour was the third time that New Zealand had visited South Africa and their first tour to the country since the end of the apartheid regime which had led to a sporting boycott of South Africa. South Africa won the Test series 2–1, despite New Zealand having won the first match of the series - the first time that a side had lost a three-match series after having led since 1888 when Australia had lost against England. New Zealand also competed in the Mandela Trophy with South Africa, Sri Lanka and Pakistan but were eliminated in the group stage, not winning any of their matches.\nThe tour saw the New Zealand team in \"disarray\" and criticised for their lack of discipline on the field. Four players were later suspended as a result of their off-field behaviour during the tour, three for smoking cannabis, and the New Zealand captain, Ken Rutherford, was twice sanctioned by the ICC match referee Peter Burge. Rutherford was sacked later in the season following a domestic season which \"degenerated into a series of traumas\" and the tour manager, Mike Sandlant, and coach Geoff Howarth both left their posts as a result of their handling of the team during the tour. A report by Director of New Zealand Cricket, Roddy Fulton, condemned Ken Rutherford's poor captaincy and lack of team management skills. The report was leaked by an unknown source to New Zealand media which subsequently revealed a number of management failings by Fulton's former teammate Geoff Howarth and the team's senior players. The tour has been called the \"Sex, Drugs and Rock 'n Roll\" tour and is considered to have had a major influence on the ways in which New Zealand Cricket administered the international side for years ahead.\nThe tour immediately followed New Zealand's involvement in the Wills World Series in India in October 1994, the majority of the team travelling directly from India to South Africa. New Zealand had not won any of their four matches during the Wills series.\nThe organisation of the Test series by the United Cricket Board of South Africa was praised by \"Wisden\". Over 150,000 spectators watched the three matches, the Board putting in place a system of reducing ticket prices throughout each day in order to attract more spectators. The policy was successful and the number of younger people who attended matches was picked out by the Almanack as a particular success. Developments to the TV umpire system, which had been introduced during Australia's tour the previous summer, and both countries agreeing to a minimum of 90 overs per day were also credited by \"Wisden\".\nTour party.\nThe New Zealand team was captained by Ken Rutherford in his last tour as captain. Martin Crowe, who became New Zealand's record run scorer in Test matches during the tour, was the vice-captain. Mark Priest was included in the tour party during the Mandela Trophy matches after having flown in as a replacement for the injured Matthew Hart who had broken a finger. Danny Morrison, who was originally not available for selection due to injury, joined the tour in its later stages as a replacement for Dion Nash who had suffered a side injury. Morrison played in the final three matches, including the second and third Tests.\nWith the addition of Crowe, who was already in South Africa rehabilitating from a knee injury, Lee Germon and Murphy Su'a, the Test team was the same side which had played in the Wills World Series immediately before the tour. The party included two uncapped players: Darrin Murray made his Test debut in the first Test of the series, having played in one of the ODIs in India, while Lee Germon made his ODI debut during the Mandela Trophy matches. Influential all-rounder Chris Cairns, who went on to play over 250 international matches, missed the tour with an injury.\nThe tour party was considered to be fairly weak due injuries and a lack of depth in talent in New Zealand cricket at the time. Speaking in 2017, Rutherford was of the opinion that \"there was [no one] we left back home who deserved to play.\"\nThe South African team was captained by Hansie Cronje in his first series as captain, having replaced Kepler Wessels following the team's failure to win a match in the 1994–95 Wills Triangular Series in Pakistan. Wessels resigned the captaincy in November before the first Test match to focus on his own batting performances but a \"recurring\" knee injury led to his retirement from international cricket in December without him playing a match during the tour.\nTest series.\nThe first Test match in the series was played in late November after a series of warm-up matches. The second and third Tests were played between 26 December and 6 January after the Mandela Trophy ODI series. South Africa were without their leading fast bowler Allan Donald throughout the series due to injury. Donald had played in every Test match since the reintegration of South Africa into international cricket in 1992. This and the absence of former captain Kepler Wessels, also through injury, left wicket-keeper Dave Richardson as the only player to have played in each Test since reintegration.\nRichardson, who was the leading run scorer of the series, was named the player of the series.\nFirst Test.\nThe first Test was played at Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg. New Zealander Darrin Murray made his Test debut in the match.\nNew Zealand won the toss and chose to bat first on a cracked pitch which looked as if it may cause problems for batsmen - \"Wisden\" wrote that \"Both sides distrusted the pitch\" although it \"played well enough until the fourth day\". New Zealand scored 411 in their first innings after a good first day and then an innings of 84 by Shane Thomson lower down the order and a tenth wicket partnership of 57 runs.\nIn reply South Africa scored 279 with Dave Richardson, who batted with a broken thumb, top scoring with 83. Martin Crowe set a new New Zealand record for the number of Test match catches during the innings, catching Richard Snell to pass Jeremy Coney's 64 catches. Fannie De Villiers bowled \"brilliantly\" to reduce New Zealand to 5/34 in their second innings before lower order runs once again helped to raise their score to 194, a lead of over 300. The wearing pitch with wide cracks helped create the conditions for a South African batting collapse on the last day of the match, the home team losing seven wickets for 39 runs on the final morning to be all out for 189, losing by 137 runs. Simon Doull, who was the man of the match, took four wickets in South Africa's second innings whilst Matthew Hart took 5/77 bowling into the rough outside off stump, setting new Test match best figures.\nThe New Zealand victory \"stunned\" South Africa, although an injury to bowler Dion Nash ruled him out of the rest of the tour.\nSecond Test.\nThe second Test began on Boxing Day at Kingsmead in Durban. It followed the Mandela Series of ODI matches which had taken place at the beginning of December. South Africa gave debuts to Jack Commins and Steven Jack.\nNew Zealand again won the toss but lost quick wickets in their first innings due, \"Wisden\" said, to \"injudicious shots\". After losing five wickets for 66 runs, a recovery led by Shane Thomson, who top-scored with a score of 82, meant that the tourists scored a total of 185. In reply South Africa started strongly but then collapsed themselves, going from 110/2 to 182/9 before a last wicket stand of 44 left them with a narrow lead having scored 226.\nAfter losing two early wickets, New Zealand opener Bryan Young scored the third slowest half-century in Test history, taking 333 minutes to reach 50 runs. Once he was out the batting collapsed again, the last six wickets falling for 48 runs, leaving South Africa a modest target of 152. They reached this with the loss of two wickets and \"Wisden\" was of the opinion that, following the loss of all of their matches in the One Day series and the disciplining of players before Christmas, New Zealand's \"decline now looked terminal\".\nDuring New Zealand's second innings Martin Crowe set another New Zealand test record, becoming the country's leading Test match run scorer after he passed John Wright's record of 5,334 runs.\nThird Test.\nThe final Test of the series took place after the New Year at Newlands in Cape Town on a relaid pitch which was \"unusually pacy\" for the ground. A combination of poor New Zealand batting and good bowling by South Africa led to South Africa winning the match by seven wickets to seal a series win, the first time that a team had come back from 1–0 down in a three match series to win the series since 1888.\nNew Zealand again won the toss and chose to bat and were reduced to 96/5 before recovering to make a total of 288. In reply South Africa made 440, including centuries for captain Hansie Cronje and a first Test century for wicket-keeper Dave Richardson, whilst Test debutant opener Rudi Steyn made 38 runs. The slow pace of scoring meant that only five sessions remained in the match. New Zealand, \"Wisden\" suggested, needed to bat for four of them to save the match and draw the series but poor batting, in particular falling into a trap set by Cronje of hooking or pulling in the air, saw them dismissed for 239, leaving South Africa 42 overs to score the 88 runs required for victory. They did so with 11 to spare and \"Wisden\" lamented the general approach of the New Zealand team which it considered \"careless\" with few of the team \"still competing\".\nOne Day International matches.\nNew Zealand played six One Day Internationals in the Mandela Trophy, playing twice against each of South Africa, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. New Zealand did not win a match during the series, losing all but their second match which was abandoned after a torrential thunderstorm flooded the ground after Sri Lanka had scored 288/4. The matches took place after the first Test match.\nFollowing an injury to Matthew Hart, replacement Mark Priest played in New Zealand's first ODI of the tournament just hours after arriving in South Africa. New Zealand lost by 69 runs in a match played on a poor quality pitch which was the subject of an inquiry. Following the abandoned second match, during which Sanath Jayasuriya scored his maiden ODI century, the team lost their remaining four matches. Their third match of the tournament saw South Africa's Dave Callaghan follow Jayasuriya's lead and score an unbeaten 169 runs, his first ODI century, on a hard pitch which favoured the South African bowlers.\nTheir fourth match saw New Zealand bowled out for the third time, collapsing from 173/2 to lose their final eight wickets for just 28 runs, although they set a more challenging target in their fifth match before losing to Sri Lanka again. The match saw New Zealand captain Ken Rutherford fined half of his match fee for attempting to influence an umpire's decision. In their final match New Zealand were bowled out again, this time for 172 runs, with Pakistan's Waqar Younis taking a hat-trick to finish the innings.\nOther matches.\nAs well as the international matches, four first-class and three other matches were played by the New Zealanders during the tour. The tour began with a friendly one-day match against NF Oppenheimer's XI and three first-class matches were played before the first Test match against Northern Transvaal, Griqualand West and Orange Free State. The New Zealanders drew with Northern Transvaal and beat Griqualand West by 23 runs before losing by two wickets to Orange Free State.\nAfter the first Test match a friendly one-day match against a Transvaal Invitational XI and a List A match against Transvaal were played, the New Zealanders winning the friendly match but losing against Transvaal. A final first-class match was played after the Mandela Series matches and before the last two Test matches against Boland. The match was abandoned at the beginning of the second day after the umpires deemed the pitch too dangerous to continue with 22 wickets having fallen on the first day, both sides having been dismissed for less than 90 runs."

        "text": "The Zimbabwe national cricket team toured South Africa in October and November 1999 and played one Test match against the South Africa national cricket team. They also competed in the 2000 Standard Bank Triangular Tournament in January and February, playing six One Day International (ODI) matches against South Africa and England. This was the first time that Zimbabwe had toured to South Africa, although sides from both Zimbabwe and Rhodesia had played in South Africa as part of South African domestic cricket.\nImmediately before Zimbabwe travelled to South Africa they had played a Test and ODI series against Australia who had toured Zimbabwe for the first time. The matches saw Zimbabwe defeated heavily. After the single Test match in South Africa the South Africans travelled to Zimbabwe and played a return Test match at Harare with only a fortnight separating the matches.\nSouth Africa won the Test match convincingly and Zimbabwe finished last in the ODI tournament. At the end of the ODI tournament England travelled to Zimbabwe to play four ODIs against Zimbabwe.with only a fortnight separating the matches.\nTour party.\nThe Zimbabwe team was captained by Alistair Campbell. This was Campbell's last Test as captain of Zimbabwe; he resigned a week after the Test match and was replaced, initially in an interim role, by Andy Flower. Fast bowler Heath Streak, who had originally been selected for the tour, was injured and replaced by Andy Blignaut. Blignaut then pulled a muscle whilst practicing and was replaced by Pommie Mbangwa. Leg-spinner Paul Strang was injured and unavailable for the tour. David Mutendera was the only uncapped member of the tour party but did not play in the Test match.\nThe South African side was captained by Hansie Cronje.\nTest match.\nThe Test match was the first to be played at Springbok Park in Bloemfontein and only the second between the two countries. Zimbabwe had been soundly beaten by Australia and without Streak and Paul Strang were fielding a weakened side. They were reduced to 79/6 before a half-century by Guy Whittall restored some respectability, although their score of 192 \"looked woefully inadequate\". South Africa scored 417 against the weakened Zimbabwean bowling attack, with Neil Johnson, who had gone into the match with an injury, unable to bowl more than two overs for the visitors. Jonty Rhodes top-scored with 70 runs for South Africa whilst Hansie Cronje became the leading South African run scorer in Test matches during his innings of 64.\nZimbabwe again lost their first six wickets for a low score, 123 in this instance, before the tail-end batsmen were able to add runs against Paul Adams' spin bowling, Whittall scoring his second half-century of the match. Adams finished with four wickets as Zimbabwe were bowled out for 212, losing the match by an innings and 13 runs on the fourth day.\nStandard Bank Triangular Tournament.\nDuring January and February 2000 Zimbabwe returned to South Africa to play in the 2000 Standard Bank Triangular Tournament, a One Day International series played between Zimbabwe, South Africa and England, who had just completed a tour of South Africa. The matches were all played over 50-overs with four of Zimbabwe's six matches played under floodlights. South Africa were considered by far the strongest of the three sides and started the tournament as clear favourites.\nHeath Streak returned to the Zimbabwe squad for the tournament having recovered his fitness. Gary Brent, Stuart Carlisle, Everton Matambanadzo and Craig Wishart all returned to the squad, with Trevor Gripper, David Mutendera, Gavin Rennie and Bryan Strang all being left out. Andy Flower retained the captaincy.\nAfter losing to South Africa in the opening match of the tournament, Henry Olonga \"destroyed\" England's batting in the second match. Olonga, who was the first black Zimbabwean to play for the national team aged 17 in 1995, took six wickets for 19 runs in the match, his best bowling figures in List A cricket. Zimbabwe won the match by 102 runs but lost to England in their next match before narrowly beating South Africa by two wickets in the second meeting between the two teams, Heath Streak scoring the winning run off the last ball of the innings after Andy Flower and Guy Whittall had put on 91 runs in a record Zimbabwean 7th wicket partnership.\nAfter each team had played four matches Zimbabwe were top of the table on run rate, each team having won two and lost two of their matches. A loss to South Africa in the third meeting between the sides, left their final match against England, the last of the group stage, as a winner-takes-all semi-final, the winner qualifying for the final. The match was rained off and England qualified on net run rate for the final where they lost to South Africa.\nOther matches.\nZimbabwe played two one-day warm up matches against South African sides at the start of the One Day International series. Before the series began they played Northerns, losing by eight runs. After their first ODI against South Africa they played another match against Boland, winning by five wickets."

In 1995 he returned to Frölunda to work as a coach and manager of their youth department. He became an assistant coach for Frölunda together with Christer Kellgren under head coach Tommy Boustedt during the 1999–00 season. The following season Karlsson was the lone assistant coach to Boustedt, and he continued as assistant coach when Conny Evensson took over as head coach prior to the 2002–03 season. Together they led Frölunda to win the 2003 Swedish Championship against Färjestads BK, winning the best-of-seven finals in four games.\nThe following season Evensson was forced to retire due to illness and Karlsson took over as interim head coach for the rest of the season. Karlsson returned to his position as assistant coach when Stephan Lundh was hired as head coach prior to the 2004–05 season. They led Frölunda to one of the best season performances in Swedish ice hockey, culminating with the 2005 Swedish Championship finals which they won against Färjestads BK four to one in games. Lundh and Karlsson coached Frölunda to their second straight finals appearance, once again against Färjestad, this time losing two to four in games.\nKarlsson, still hired by Frölunda, took a leave of absence prior to the 2006–07 season and signed a contract with Linköpings HC as assistant coach to Gunnar Persson. Persson was fired in January 2007 and Karlsson took over the job as head coach, he led Linköping to the Swedish Championship finals where they lost two games to four against Modo Hockey. The following season Karlsson led Linköping to their second straight finals appearance, where they lost to HV71 two games to four. Karlsson returned to Frölunda prior to the 2008–09 season as assistant coach to Ulf Dahlén.\nPrior to the 2009–10 season Karlsson was named the head coach of HV71 of the Elitserien. He became Swedish champions in his first season with the team, winning the regulation series, reaching and winning the finals. However, the following season, the team performed worse; although the team won the regulation series for a second consecutive year, the team surprisingly were eliminated by Elitserien newcomers AIK already in the quarter-finals, losing 4–0 in games.\nAfter the 2010–11 season, Karlsson left HV71 and signed as assistant coach to Bengt-Åke Gustafsson in the Atlant Moscow Oblast of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). After a disappointing start of the 2011–12 season for Moscow Oblast, Karlsson took over the head-coaching job for the team as Gustafsson was forced to leave the club. Karlsson was fired from Atlant on 20 October 2012. He took over the head coach job of Rögle BK on 12 January 2013, as the team were last placed in the standings.\nIn June 2013 he was named new head coach of the Denmark's national icehockey team.\nInternational.\nKarlsson's debuted as a coach with Tre Kronor during the 2002–03 Euro Hockey Tour as assistant coach to Hardy Nilsson at the Baltica Brewery Cup. The following season he was assistant coach to Nilsson at the Česká Pojišťovna Cup and Moscow International Tournament. During the 2004–05 Euro Hockey Tour Karlsson was assistant coach to interim national team head coaches Bengt-Åke Gustafsson—at the Karjala Tournament—and Roger Melin—at the Sweden Hockey Games. Gustafsson was appointed permanent national team coach in February 2005 and choose Karlsson along with Tommy Boustedt and Tommy Samuelsson as assistant coaches for the 2005 World Championships, where Tre Kronor lost to Russia in the bronze medal game. In September 2005 Karlsson was announced as a permanent assistant coach to Gustafsson, he participated in all the 2005–06 Euro Hockey Tour tournaments except for the Rosno Cup.\nAt the 2006 Olympics Karlsson and Anders Eldebrink were assistant coaches to Gustafsson and together they led Tre Kronor to an Olympic gold medal. A few months later at the 2006 World Championships Karlsson again with Boustedt and Samuelsson were assistant coaches to Gustafsson when Sweden won their eight World Championship gold medal, becoming the first country to win both the Olympics and World Championships in the same year. During the 2006–07 Euro Hockey Tour Karlsson participated at the Česká Pojišťovna Cup, the Channel One Cup, and the Euro Hockey Tour finals which Tre Kronor won against Russia. Karlsson together with Boustedt and Samuelsson were assistant coaches to Gustafsson at the 2007 World Championship, where Tre Kronor lost to Russia in the bronze medal game. Following the World Championship Karlsson announced that he resigned from his permanent position with Tre Kronor due to his obligations as head coach of Linköping. However Karlsson returned to Tre Kronor together with Eldebrink as an assistant coaches to Gustafsson for the 2008 World Championship, where Tre Kronor lost to Finland in the bronze medal game.\nPersonal life.\nKarlsson was born 28 August 1958, in Växjö but grew up in Åseda. Karlsson and his wife Carina have two children, daughter Emelie and son Robin.\nWhile playing for HV71 Karlsson worked as a recreation leader, and while playing for Frölunda he worked as a janitor at an upper secondary school."

        "title": "Professional baseball in Japan",
        "text": "Professional baseball in Japan first started in the 1920s, but it was not until the was established in 1934 that the modern professional game had continued success.\nHistory.\nBaseball was introduced to Japan in 1872 by Horace Wilson, and its first formal team was established in 1878. For almost 30 years, until 1906, a game could be viewed free of charge, as it was considered shameful to take money for doing something the players liked.\nEarly attempts.\nIn 1907, the first game was held that had a fee to watch. From 1908, several United States professional teams toured Japan and played against amateur teams made up mostly of university students, including both the Chicago White Sox and the New York Giants in 1913. Realizing that a professional league was necessary to improve, two professional teams were established in 1920. In the same year, teams held exhibition tours in Korea and Manchuria to spread baseball. This first professional league disintegrated in 1923 for financial reasons, and after repeated attempts to revive a professional league, it formally disbanded in 1929.\nJapanese Baseball League.\nThe American Major League Baseball outfielder Lefty O'Doul was instrumental in spreading baseball's popularity in Japan, serving as the sport's goodwill ambassador before and after World War II.\nIn 1934, the was established, reviving professional baseball. A second team, the was established in the following year. The former became the Yomiuri Giants (O'Doul dubbed the team the \"Tokyo Giants\") and the latter became the Hanshin Tigers. In 1936, five other teams also formed, and the Japanese Baseball League (JBL) was started. Because of World War II, the JBL was forced to stop playing for a year beginning in 1944; it restarted on November 6, 1945, and a full season was played the next year.\nA rival four-team league, known as the , played a 30-game summer season in 1947. Unable to compete against the more established JBL, the Kokumin League disbanded a few games into the 1947 fall season.\nNippon Professional Baseball.\nThe Japanese Baseball League disbanded in 1949, reorganizing itself in 1950 as Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). (It is called , which simply is a translation of \"professional baseball\".) The Central League included the established teams, and the Pacific League was made up of new teams and players. The Pacific League uses the designated hitter style of play. The pro baseball season is eight months long with games beginning in April. Teams play 144 games (as compared to the 162 games of the American major league teams), followed by a playoff system, culminating in a championship held in October, known as the Japan Series.\nCorporations with interests outside baseball own the teams. Historically, teams have been identified with their owners, not where the team is based. However, in recent years, many owners have chosen to include a place name in the names of their teams; seven of the 12 Nippon Professional Baseball League (NPB) teams are currently named with both corporate and place names. Maruha Corporation has taken this one step farther by completely dropping its name from its NPB team, the Yokohama BayStars.\nStrike of 2004.\nOn September 18, 2004, professional baseball players went on a two-day strike, the first strike in over 70 years. The strike arose from a dispute that took place between the owners and the players' union concerning the merging of the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes and the Orix BlueWave, and the failure of the owners to agree to create a new team to fill the void resulting from the merger. The owners wanted to get rid of the financially defunct Buffaloes, and merge the two baseball leagues, since teams in the Central League saw much higher profits than the Pacific League, having popular teams such as the Yomiuri Giants and Hanshin Tigers. The dispute received huge press coverage (which mostly favored the players' union) and was dubbed one of the biggest events in the history of Japanese baseball. Proposals and amendments concerning interleague games, player drafting, and management were also discussed between the players union and the owners during this period. The players decided to strike on September 18–19, when no progress was made in the negotiations, as there was insufficient time left in the season to hold discussions. The dispute officially ended after the two groups reached consensus on September 23, 2004. As part of the agreement, the Buffaloes were allowed to merge with the Blue Wave (forming into the Orix Buffaloes); in addition, the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles were newly created (at a reduced \"entry fee\") to keep the former six-team league structure. Other agreements included the leagues adopting interleague play to help the Pacific League gain exposure by playing the more popular Central league teams. All these changes took place before the 2005 season.\nIn December 2004, SoftBank, an internet service provider, purchased the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks to help with finances in the Pacific League.\nInternational play.\nSince 1986, a team of Major League Baseball All-Stars has made a biennial end-of-the-season tour of Japan, playing exhibitions games against the Nippon Professional Baseball All-Stars in the Major League Baseball Japan All-Star Series.\nStarting in 1992 and continuing intermittently, several Major League Baseball teams have played exhibition games against Japanese teams. American teams popular in Japan include the Chicago Cubs, Seattle Mariners, Boston Red Sox, and New York Yankees, at least in part due to Japanese players on those teams.\n2005 marked the first Asia Series, pitting the champions of the Japanese, South Korean, and Taiwanese leagues along with the Mainland China All-Stars.\nDifferences from Major League Baseball.\nThe NPB rules are essentially those of Major League Baseball, but technical elements are slightly different: The Nippon league uses a smaller baseball strike zone and playing field. The Japanese baseball is wound more tightly and is harder than an American baseball. The strike zone is narrower \"inside\" than away from the batter. Five Nippon league teams have fields whose small dimensions would violate the American Official Baseball Rules.\nAlso unlike MLB, game length is limited and tie games are allowed. In the regular season, the limit is twelve innings, while in the playoffs, there is a fifteen-inning limit (games in Major League Baseball, by comparison, continue until there is a winner; the 2002 All-Star Game, an exhibition game, was a notorious exception). Additionally, since the 2011 NPB season, an inning occurring three hours and thirty minutes after the first pitch was the final inning, due to power limits imposed because of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.\nA team cannot have more than four foreign players on a 25-man game roster, although there is no limit on the number of foreign players that it may sign. If there are four, they cannot all be pitchers nor all be position players. This limits the cost and competition for expensive players of other nationalities, and is similar to rules in many European sports leagues' roster limits on non-European players.\nIn each of the two Nippon Professional Baseball leagues, teams with the best winning percentage go on to a stepladder-format playoff (3 vs 2, winner vs 1). Occasionally, a team with more total wins has been seeded below a team that had more ties and fewer losses and, therefore, had a better winning percentage. The winners of each league compete in the Japan Series.\nForeign players in professional baseball in Japan.\nThe American writer Robert Whiting wrote in his 1977 book \"The Chrysanthemum and the Bat\" that,\nWhile others have objected to characterizing the sport in these terms, many Japanese players and managers describe themselves this way.\nFumito \"Jimmy\" Horio became the first American to play professional baseball in Japan when he joined the Dai Nippon Tokyo Yakyu Kurabu (Tokyo Giants) in December 1934, touring with them in 1935.\nHorio, Jimmy Bonna, Kiyomi \"Slim\" Hirakawa, Kazuyoshi \"George\" Matsuura, Andrew \"Bucky\" Harris McGalliard (Japan's \"Bucky Harris\"), Herbert \"Buster\" North, Yoshio \"Sam\" Takahashi, and Tadashi \"Bozo\" Wakabayashi became the first Americans to play in Japan's professional baseball league in 1936.\nHundreds of foreigners—particularly Americans—have played Nippon Professional Baseball. Taiwanese nationals Shosei Go and Hiroshi Oshita both starred in the 1940s. American players began to steadily find spots on NPB rosters in the 1960s. American players hold several NPB records, including highest career batting average (Leron Lee, .334), highest single-season batting average (Randy Bass, .389), and the dubious record of most strikeouts in a season by a hitter (Ralph Bryant, 204). Americans rank #3 (Tuffy Rhodes, 55) and #5 (Randy Bass, 54) on the list of most home runs in a season, and #2 in single-season RBI (Bobby Rose, 153). Curaçaoan–Dutch outfielder Wladimir Balentien holds the NPB single-season home run record with 60 round-trippers in 2013. \nKoreans have had an impact in the NPB as well, including such standout players as Lee Seung-yuop, Sun Dong-yol, Baek In-chun, Lee Jong-beom, and Dae-ho Lee. Venezuelans Alex Ramírez, Alex Cabrera, Bobby Marcano, and Roberto Petagine all had long, successful NPB careers. The Dominican third-baseman José Fernández played eleven years in the NPB, compiling a .282 batting average with 206 home runs and 772 runs batted in.\nSince the 1970s, foreigners have also made an impact in Nippon Professional Baseball's managing and coaching ranks, with Americans Bobby Valentine and Trey Hillman managing their respective teams to Japan Series championships.\nMany of the most celebrated foreign players came to Japan after not finding success in the Major Leagues.

He did not manage again until the Washington Nationals, then 10–29, hired him to finish out the season. He led the team to a mark of 38–57, and ended his major league career with a record of 132-132. Sullivan later managed in the minors, including a stint with the Nashville Tigers of the Southern League in .\nSullivan is considered a pioneer of early baseball; he founded both the Northwest League and the Texas League, both minor leagues that still exist and thrive today. Credited with discovering Charles Comiskey, he is considered by some to be the first person to emphasize the importance of scouting. Comiskey joined the St. Louis Browns in , and replaced Sullivan as the team's manager in mid-; it had been Sullivan's first managerial post, as he compiled a record of 53–26 to begin the year. Also, Sullivan was a great promoter of the game; he would tell stories of baseball's beginnings, and of its many star players. He authored books detailing these, including a barnstorming trip around the world in 1913–1914 by Comiskey's Chicago White Sox and the New York Giants. He also credited himself as the originator of the word \"fan\", as in baseball fan. Sullivan later became a team executive and owner.\nPost-career.\nSullivan died in Washington, D.C. at the age of 78, and is interred at Calvary Catholic Cemetery in Milwaukee, Wisconsin."

        "text": "Carlos Manuel Villanueva Paulino (born November 28, 1983) is a Dominican former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Milwaukee Brewers, Toronto Blue Jays, Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Cardinals and San Diego Padres. He currently works as Special Assistant to the General Manager/Player Development for the Milwaukee Brewers.\nCareer.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nVillanueva was signed by the San Francisco Giants in . He and Glenn Woolard were traded to the Milwaukee Brewers on March 30, 2004, for pitchers Wayne Franklin and Leo Estrella. He joined the Beloit Snappers, the Brewers Single A club.\nAs he worked his way through the Brewers' farm system, Villanueva was called up to the Brewers from Double-A Huntsville on May 22, . He made his Major League debut against the Cincinnati Reds on May 23, 2006, pitching a scoreless inning. On July 15, 2006, Villanueva combined with fellow Nashville Sounds pitchers Mike Meyers and Alec Zumwalt to throw a combined no-hitter against the Memphis Redbirds. Villanueva was recalled again, making his first career major league start for the Brewers against the Cincinnati Reds.\nAfter a successful 2006 campaign, Villanueva entered the spring training in competition for the Brewers fifth spot in the starting rotation. Despite pitching well, he lost the job to Claudio Vargas. Instead, manager Ned Yost elected to put Villanueva into the bullpen as a middle relief pitcher. Villanueva pitched well in his new role and was occasionally used as a long relief pitcher when Elmer Dessens was placed on the DL. On July 2, Villanueva had a 6–0 win–loss record with a 2.64 earned run average (ERA). Despite his record, Villanueva was accustomed to only being used as a starting pitcher, and had never appeared in more than 25 games in his professional career. Through July and August, he posted a 1-3 record with an ERA of over 9, perhaps a sign of being overworked. Despite his struggles, he was still being used as a middle relief pitcher. On August 20, after pitching 3 perfect innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks and picking up his first career save, he was optioned to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds to make two starts to \"polish up\" for a September call up when the rosters expand.\nVillanueva spent a short part of the season as the closer while Trevor Hoffman recovered on the disabled list; however, after poor performances, the role was given to Todd Coffey instead.\nHe is currently serving with the Milwaukee Brewers as a Special Assistant to the General Manager/Player Development. \nToronto Blue Jays.\nOn December 3, 2010, Villanueva was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for a player to be named later (cash).\nAfter starting the season in the bullpen for the Blue Jays, he was moved to a position in the starting rotation to fill in for open spots previously filled by Brett Cecil and Jesse Litsch. On August 4, 2011, Villanueva was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a right forearm strain. Villanueva was re-activated from the disabled list on August 31. Brian Tallet was designated for assignment to make room for Villanueva. Villanueva began the 2012 season as the long reliever in the Jays' bullpen, but was promoted to a starter after numerous injuries to the pitching staff. After posting a 6-1 record, Villanueva left the team for personal reasons on August 5. J. A. Happ started in place of Villanueva.\nChicago Cubs.\nOn December 19, 2012, it was reported that Villanueva had agreed a two-year, $10 million contract with the Chicago Cubs. The deal became official on January 26, 2013, more than a month after it was initially agreed upon. Lendy Castillo was designated for assignment to make room for Villanueva on the 40-man roster. Dale Sveum made Villanueva the Cubs fifth starter in their rotation. His first game on April 6, a road game against the Atlanta Braves, resulted in a no decision.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nOn February 4, 2015, the St. Louis Cardinals signed Villanueva to a minor league contract that included an invitation to spring training. The Cardinals added him to their 40-man roster on March 30. On June 27, he pitched the last three innings of an 8–1 victory over the Cubs for his first save of the season, and did so again on August 7 against the Brewers in a 6–0 win. It was his fourth and fifth career save of at least three innings. Villanueva pitched solely out of the bullpen in 2015 and was credited with a 4–3 record with two saves, 55 strikeouts, and 50 hits and 21 walks allowed. He posted career-bests in ERA (2.95) and inherited runners strand rate (80.5 percent); the WHIP (1.16), batting average on balls in play (.265) and batting average against (.220) were his best figures since his first MLB season with the Brewers.\nSan Diego Padres.\nOn January 13, 2016, the San Diego Padres signed Villanueva to a one-year, $1.5 million contract.\nHanwha Eagles.\nOn February 24, 2017, he signed with the Hanwha Eagles of the KBO League."

        "title": "G. F. Vernon's cricket team in Ceylon and India in 1889–90",
        "text": "In the 1889–90 cricket season, an English team managed by George Vernon and captained by Lord Hawke toured Ceylon and India. It was a pioneering tour being the first visit by an English team to India and the second to Ceylon, following the stopover by Ivo Bligh's team to Australia in 1882–83. Vernon's team, known as G. F. Vernon's XI, was entirely composed of players with amateur status and, in the absence of professionals, none of its matches have been recognised as first-class. In all, they played thirteen matches from 28 November 1889 to 1 March 1890, starting with two games in Ceylon before moving on to Calcutta where the Indian part of the tour began in late December.\nOf the thirteen matches, Vernon's XI won ten (six by over an innings) and drew two. They were defeated only once, by the Parsis in a match which had great significance for the native communities living under the rule of the British Raj. The matches were all played under the \"Laws of Cricket\" which prevailed in England at the time, including the compulsory follow-on and the recently introduced 5-ball over. The tour was a success and it made a significant contribution to the growth and development of cricket in the sub-continent.\nPreparations.\nIn the 21 March 1889 issue of \"Cricket: A Weekly Record of the Game\", the news section includes a piece about \"the probable visit of a party of English amateurs to India at the fall of this year\". Arrangements were reported to be \"progressing most satisfactorily\" with contacts in Calcutta saying the idea of the tour \"seems to be universally popular throughout India\". The team was expected to set sail end of October and spend Christmas in Calcutta. Lord Hawke and G. F. Vernon were the main organisers in England, and they had thus far extended invitations to J. G. Walker, Albert Leatham, J. H. J. Hornsby, H. E. Rhodes, Edward Beaumont-Nesbitt, F. L. Shand and H. W. Forster.\nIn the 11 July issue, the news editor confirmed that the party would sail on the P&amp;O steamer \"Bengal\" which was scheduled to leave London for Colombo, Madras and Calcutta on 31 October. The planned schedule was to play two matches in Ceylon during the stopover at Colombo. Madras would only be a short stopover so the intention was to begin the Indian matches in Calcutta, where it was hoped they would spend Christmas week. No definite match arrangements could yet be confirmed, however, and they did not expect to finalise a fixture list until they arrived in India. They intended to terminate the tour around the end of February. Hawke and Vernon continued to organise things from England. They had received acceptances from Walker, Leatham, Hornsby, Rhodes and Shand, who were all mentioned in March; additional acceptances had been received from Hylton Philipson and E. M. Lawson-Smith. Beaumont-Nesbitt had apparently declined; Forster was said to have accepted but nevertheless did not make the trip. The organisers had also invited Francis Lacey, but his availability was uncertain and, eventually, he did not join the team.\nThe arrangements seemed to be progressing well until the sudden death on 10 September of H. E. Rhodes, who accidentally fell from a hotel balcony in Dover. \"Cricket\" magazine paid tribute to him on 31 October, the same day the team was due to depart. Most of the team met at Liverpool Street Station that day and travelled to Tilbury, to embark on the \"Bengal\" which had been lying off Gravesend. Those heading for Tilbury were Vernon, Walker, Lawson-Smith, Hornsby, Philipson and three recent recruits: Arthur Gibson, George Hone-Goldney and Thomas Tapling. Two more, Ernest de Little and F. L. Shand would meet them in Colombo. Rhodes' replacement was A. N. Curzon who would join the team in January. Reserve wicket-keeper Tapling, who was both an eminent philatelist and the MP for Harborough, sailed on the \"Bengal\" as far as Naples where a close friend was taken ill. Tapling opted to stay with him, thereby missing the Ceylonese leg of the tour. He arrived in India just before Christmas 1889 and played in six matches between then and the end of February.\nAlso missing from the \"Bengal\" was Hawke who had left a week earlier and gone to Bombay as he wanted to do some big-game hunting. This venture backfired somewhat because, while he was staying in Gwalior, he was struck down with a serious attack of gastritis. That not only stopped him from killing animals but also from meeting his teammates in Calcutta, as he had planned. It was not until February, when nine of the thirteen matches had been played, that Hawke was able to rejoin the team.\n\"Cricket\" reported on 28 November that the \"Bengal\" had docked in Colombo two days earlier on schedule. The 27 December issue carried the first match report from the tour of the match in Kandy against \"All Ceylon\".\nItinerary and results.\nThe tour began in Kandy on 28 November 1889. The team played two matches in Ceylon and then moved on to India in December. Starting with the match against the Calcutta Cricket Club at Eden Gardens on 23 December, they played eleven matches in India to the end of February 1890.\nThe precise names and locations of some venues cannot now be established and many of the team names were arbitrarily derived from their locations. With the single exception of the Parsis, all the home teams were composed of European colonials who were mostly British expatriates.\nThe matches were scheduled for either two or three days' duration. The two-day matches are noted as such in the table below; the rest were all scheduled for three days. There was no Sunday play and all the matches were arranged so that they would be completed on consecutive days with no Sunday break. \nTour summary.\nPlaying standards.\nAnalysing the quality of Vernon's team, James Coldham in his biography of Hawke said they were a \"useful\" combination in that they had plenty of batting and most types of bowling. They had, too, a very good wicket-keeper because Philipson later played for England. Coldham saw them as what he called a mix of regular county players, Oxbridge types and \"first-rate club players\" who would have been a good Minor Counties team. They were by no means first-class but, of their time, a real handful for any Ceylonese or Indian opposition. Ramachandra Guha concurs with this view, saying that Vernon's XI \"could not be judged a first-class side (although) they played cricket of a quality not generally seen in India\".\nThe general weakness of the Indian and Ceylonese opposition is evident in the number of wide winning margins achieved by Vernon's XI, six of the ten wins by an innings and plenty. Twelve of their thirteen hosts had teams which comprised the typical combination of British expatriates who were mostly civil servants or soldiers. The expatriate XIs were no better than English local club teams and so, for the most part, they were easily beaten by Vernon's XI.\nThe tourists arrived in Bombay from Allahabad about a week before the end of January 1890. They had won six and drawn one of their seven matches. Among the individual highlights had been centuries by Vernon, Gibson and Walker; and strong bowling performances by Hornsby, Gibson, Leatham and de Little. Vernon's XI then easily disposed of the Bombay Gymkhana team by an innings, Hornsby taking 13/78 in the match. Their next match was also on the Gymkhana Grounds and it was advertised as the \"Cricket Championship of India\".\nParsis match.\nThe only match in which Vernon's team faced an ethnic team with no Europeans was the low-scoring one at the end of January against the Parsis on the Bombay Gymkhana. The Parsis had a distinct community in Bombay and, having embraced British rule and culture, they were the real pioneers of Indian cricket and had sent two touring teams to Great Britain, in 1886 and 1888. Until the last fifteen or so years of the 19th century, the sport in India had always been an essentially British pursuit. Its increasing popularity among the native population coincided with the rise of their influence in administrative and political matters. In 1890, as Coldham says, the Parsis were the only native community capable of putting a team in the field.\nIt was a two-day match, 30 and 31 January. At the end of the first day, the Parsis were 80/9 in response to the tourists' 97 all out, which included 45 by Vernon. The Parsis added two more runs in the morning and Vernon's XI began their second innings with a lead of 15. The best Parsi player was their all-rounder M. E. Pavri who was a fast bowler. He had been successful in England on the 1888 tour. He now dismissed Vernon's XI for only 61, taking 7/34. The Parsis needed 77 to claim a significant victory over their English opponents and, despite Hornsby's efforts, they accomplished it with four wickets to spare. Pavri took 9/37 in the match and also top-scored with 21 in the Parsi second innings. He played for Middlesex a few years later and was known as the \"Grace of the Parsis\" because, like W. G. Grace, he was both an all-rounder and a doctor.\nThere is no doubt that it was a significant victory because it sparked celebrations throughout Bombay and was acclaimed as \"the greatest sporting contest in the city's history\". Many saw it as \"a blow to the prestige of Empire\" and the pro-Raj \"Bombay Gazette\" resorted to making speculative excuses such as: \"Had Mr Vernon not been run out\". There was little if any actual trouble and efforts were made to jointly celebrate the occasion but, as Guha commented, \"it revealed the communal competitiveness that would drive the progress of cricket in colonial India\". The \"Bombay Gazette\" called for a resurgence of European cricket while the Parsi newspaper \"Rast Goftar\" asked their players to bear in mind that Hindu and Muslim cricketers would be seeking to emulate their success, so they must themselves be ready to face challenges.\nFour weeks later, when \"Cricket\" published the match report and scorecard, the magazine paid a glowing tribute to the Parsis saying their victory \"cannot fail to give a fresh impetus to the practice of the game among the followers of that great community\". According to a separate report in the same issue of \"Cricket\", there was a celebratory dinner for the tourists on the night of the 30th (after the first day of the match). On the night of the 31st, Vernon's team travelled to Lucknow on the Jubbulpore mail train. It was expected they would return to Bombay after playing the Punjab in Lahore at the end of February and there would be a return match against the Parsis. That, however, did not happen as the Lahore match was the final one.\nLater matches.\nWhen Vernon's XI arrived in Lucknow, their opponents were the usual British expatriate combination. The Lucknow team nevertheless gave Vernon's XI a real scare. It was Hawke's first match on the tour and he took over the captaincy from Vernon. Hawke opened the batting himself and was bowled for a duck. The team was all out for only 79 and Lucknow responded with 125 to lead by 46 on first innings. Hawke was nearly out straightaway in his second innings but the third man fielder dropped the catch. Hawke went on to make 45 and, with 68 by Walker and 47* by Philipson, Vernon's XI scored 229 to set Lucknow a target of 184. The pitch was very worn and they were bowled out by de Little and Gibson who took five wickets each, Vernon's XI winning by 123 runs.\nUsing the railways as their primary means of transport, the team moved on to Agra. Hone-Goldney, Hornsby and Vernon himself had all succumbed to illness or injury and three local replacements – Hilliard, John and Maxwell – had to be drafted in. Lawson-Smith rose to the occasion with a first innings century before de Little and Gibson bowled Agra out for two low totals. Apart from Gloucestershire batsman Walter Troup, the Agra team had little to offer and this was a routine win for Vernon's XI. Troup carried his bat though the Agra first innings with 59* in a total of 116.\nIn Meerut, the tourists again encountered Troup, this time playing for a team called Northern India. Vernon had recovered and his team totalled 304 in the first innings with seven batsmen making scores of between 23 and 54. Hoping for another convincing victory, Vernon's XI were frustrated by Troup (42) and John Waterfield (98), who forged a stubborn and time-consuming fourth wicket partnership. Although Northern India had to follow-on, there was not enough time left for the tourists to dismiss them again, and the match was drawn.\nSoon afterwards, de Little broke a collarbone in a riding accident. The team had only eight fit players when they arrived in Lahore for the final match against a Punjab team; Vernon himself was again among the absentees. They recruited John Waterfield for this match along with Army officers Herman Bonham-Carter and Hugh Bateman-Champain. Vernon's XI won by an innings, the match and the tour ending on 1 March 1890.\nThe team's highest runscorers on the tour were Walker (515) and Vernon himself (478). Vernon's 128 in the opening match against Ceylon was the highest individual score; three other centuries were scored by Lawson-Smith (117), Walker (108) and Gibson (100). The leading bowlers by wickets taken were Hornsby (69), Gibson (67) and de Little (49).\nAftermath.\nThe tour was a success and it made a significant contribution to the growth and development of cricket in the sub-continent. On 27 March 1890, \"Cricket\" magazine reproduced an article in India's \"Pioneer Mail\" which praised Vernon's XI for \"setting on foot an enterprise now sure to be repeated\". It would not be long before it was repeated as another touring party arrived in 1892, this time led by Hawke and including F. S. Jackson, the future England captain, and Ledger Hill. Gibson, Hornsby, Leatham, and Vernon all returned. Colynge Caple remarked that the tour had originated as \"something in the nature of a pleasure trip\" but in the end it forged \"yet another link in the ever-growing chain of international cricket\".\nThe Parsis had first played the European members of the Bombay Gymkhana in 1877. The Europeans won after the Parsis had surprisingly taken a first innings lead and the match was reiterated several times in the following years. The Parsis went to England twice in the 1880s and were all that time gaining expertise and experience. In the Gymkhana match of September 1889, the Parsis won by 10 wickets and then, four months later, came the celebrated victory over Vernon's XI. Mihir Bose likened the popular acclaim of the Parsi team to that of a people who had lost their country long ago and suddenly rediscovered themselves on a cricket field.\nTwo years later, the Parsis were playing their European counterparts in a match billed as the Bombay Presidency and generally accorded first-class status, the inaugural first-class match in India. Unfortunately, it was ruined by rain and resulted in a draw, but it meant the Parsis had arrived at cricket's highest level. In the years that followed, the cricketers among the Hindu and Muslim communities inevitably caught up and the Bombay Presidency Match became the Bombay Triangular in 1907 and the Bombay Quadrangular in 1912.\nPlayers.\nThe list below includes all players who represented Vernon's XI in at least one of the thirteen matches. There was no formal squad selection process as for later Test teams and the players became involved as a result of receiving friendly invitations, or by being available when the team was short of numbers. Some players therefore had a very temporary association with the team at one or two locations only. The table gives the name, cricket club (if specific), age (i.e., on 1 November 1889) and on-field roles of each player:"

The next time Zimbabwe played Sri Lanka in a Test match was in October 2016.\nThe series was preceded by a massive crisis rocking Zimbabwe cricket, with captain Heath Streak sacked and dropped from the team for criticising the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) and several of its policies, including the quota system for non-white cricketers and politicisation of the sport among others. Subsequently, thirteen leading Zimbabwean cricketers, all of them white, rebelled and made themselves unavailable for selection in protest against the treatment meted out to Streak by the ZCU. As a result, a second-string side led by wicketkeeper Tatenda Taibu and comprising mostly black cricketers was selected to face Sri Lanka. The side proved to be clearly uncompetitive as the Lankans whitewashed them in both the ODIs and Tests by margins of 5-0 and 2-0 respectively, winning all matches by heavy margins and winning both Tests by an innings.\nDue to the shambolic performance by the Zimbabweans, the ZCU scrapped all Test matches involving Zimbabwe for the rest of the year. The series marked the start of the downfall for Zimbabwe cricket which continues to this day."

In March, Chen took part in the All England Open. In yet another quarter-final showing, he lost to Kenichi Tago in rubber games. In the following week, Chen managed to capture his second Swiss Open. The finalist he beat was his compatriot Chen Long. Chen won in rubber games 12–21, 21–15, 21–17 in the final.

He beat Indonesia's Taufik Hidayat 21–13, 21–15 in the final. In September, Chen participated in the China Masters but was outplayed by Chou Tien-chen from Chinese Taipei 18–21, 8–16 (retired) in the second round due to a leg injury.

He played in Major League Baseball for the Philadelphia Athletics, New York Giants, Philadelphia Phillies, Pittsburgh Pirates, Boston Red Sox, and Cincinnati Reds.\nA starter most of his career, Bowman also filled various relief roles coming out from the bullpen, as a closer or a middle reliever, and as a set-up man as well. He reached the majors in 1932 with the Philadelphia Athletics, spending one year with them before moving to the New York Giants (1934), Philadelphia Phillies (1935–37), Pittsburgh Pirates (1937–41), Boston Red Sox (1944–45) and Cincinnati Reds (1945). He was one of two 20-game losers with the last-place 1936 Phillies, but won 39 games in five seasons for Pittsburgh. He went 12–8 with Boston in 1944 and won 11 games for Cincinnati in 1945, his last major league season. Often used as a pinch hitter, he hit .333 in 1938 and .344 in 1939.\nIn an 11-season career, Bowman posted a 77–96 record with a 4.40 ERA and 11 saves in 298 appearances, including 184 starts, 74 complete games, five shutouts, and 1465 innings pitched. As a hitter, he collected a .221 batting average (141-for-639) with two home runs and 75 RBI in 430 games.\nAfter his playing career, Joe Bowman was a minor league player and manager before becoming a successful baseball scout. Bowman was the Scouting Director for Charlie Finley's Kansas City A's from 1960 to 1968. In that role, Bowman was instrumental in assembling a scouting staff and finding the players who would become the core of the Oakland Athletics' three World Series Champion teams from 1972 to 1974. When the A's moved to Oakland in 1968, Bowman decided to stay home in Kansas City where he became a regional scout first for the Atlanta Braves for a brief time before a long stint scouting for the Baltimore Orioles."

Zhang was playing nervously and a line judge called one of his shots long to which he made a protest to the umpire, who did not have the authority to overrule the call. In a bizarre change of mind the line judge then corrected his call; Robertson then made his own protest to no avail and the Chinese won back the serve. They pulled back two points to make it 8-10 but after a couple more exchanges of serves the British had set point at 14-10. However they couldn't immediately capitalise on this and Zhang and Gao pulled back to 12-14 but on their next serve the Chinese hit the return long to give Robertson and Emms the set and tie the match at 1-1.\nThe start of the third set saw the Chinese power their way to an early 3-0 lead and after an exchange of serves the British this time got a close line call in their favour to regain the serve and register a point. Again the service changed hands a couple of times but Robertson and Emms then took a 5-3 lead and on their next set of serves extended this to 7-3 with the Chinese trying every time-wasting trick in the book. The serve changed hands a couple of more times without troubling the scorer until Zhang and Gao made a charge to re-take the lead at 8-6 at which point the teams swapped ends. This change suited the British pair and they pulled level at 8-8 and then pulled ahead at 11-8. Another flurry from the Chinese saw this see-saw game tilt in their favour to reach match point at 14-11 but a nervously played gold medal point saw Robertson keep the British in the match. They added one more point before losing their serve and giving the Chinese the chance to serve for the gold again. Emms saved the first point with a terrific backhand but on their second service the Chinese won the point to deny the British and take the set and the match 15-12.\nThis was the first time since the event's debut at the 1992 Summer Olympics that a non-Asian team had made it to the final."

        "title": "Lambton Golf and Country Club",
        "text": "The Lambton Golf and Country Club is a private golf and tennis club in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The golf club was established by Albert William Austin in 1902. The golf club is presently members with Golf Canada, and the United States Golf Association., and has hosted a number of competitions including the Canadian Open, and the Canadian Amateur Championship.\nHistory.\nThe seeds of the golf club were planted by Toronto Businessman James Austin. He rebuilt Spadina House (which is now a museum) in 1866 to house his family. He died after several months of illness at the age of eighty-four in 1897. At his death he had a fortune of some $300,000 which was divided between his son and daughter. His business interests and his home passed on to his son Albert William Austin.\nAlbert Austin had laid out a few holes of golf in vacant farmlands in the area where Casa Loma now stands. This was strictly for the pleasure of his family and a few friends but grew into the Spadina Golf Club, which had a layout through farmers' fields north over St. Clair Avenue, through Forest Hill Village to just south of Eglinton. The clubhouse was a rented farmhouse at the northeast corner of St. Clair and Spadina Road.\nIn early 1902, the Spadina members recognized that the farmers were likely to sell for development the land on which the nine-hole course lay.\nAs plans for the new course took shape, the estimated cost of $30,000 to develop the property at Lambton Mills, on which an option had been obtained, caused Austin to solicit support from a wider group of golfing enthusiasts, including members of Rosedale, High Park and Highlands Golf Clubs as well as Spadina. \nThe response to the solicitation was such that a committee, chaired by Austin and including George S. Lyon, proceeded with the project, and the official opening took place in driving rain on 13 June 1903. Membership was close to 400, and it was estimated 1,000 persons attended the opening ceremonies. Most of the original members traveled to play the course by train, disembarking at a small station near the club. A plaque now on the 18th tee commemorates this mode of transportation, as well as the opening of the club.\nLambton had some noteworthy features for that day and age. The nine-hole Valley Course for Ladies was an innovation. The club had a telephone. An ice house was built adjoining the clubhouse, which, before opening day, already contained 100 tons of Lake Simcoe ice.\nLambton's traditions owe much to the founding members, including the club's official red jacket, which is a modified form of that worn by Austin in his portrait, which hangs in the clubhouse. Another tradition, the singing of \"My Wild Irish Rose\" at certain club dinners is a continuation of the practice introduced by George S. Lyon.\nThe original clubhouse was constructed over the winter of 1902-03 and was ready for the club’s official opening on June 13, 1903. Today, Lambton Golf and Country Club occupies 171 acres of rolling terrain defined by the Humber River and Black Creek.\nOver the years, Lambton has hosted numerous provincial and national championships, including four Canadian Opens, four Canadian Amateurs, the Canadian Ladies’ Amateur Championship, the Canadian PGA Championship, the second Canadian Seniors Golf Association Championship in 1919, the Canadian Women’s Senior Golf Association Championship and others. \nThe golf course experienced flooding in October 1954, after Hurricane Hazel passed through the area. The course was restored in early 1960s, and a new clubhouse was built, including facilities for curling.\nLambton has awarded two honorary lifetime memberships. The first was awarded to Marlene Stewart Streit in 1953 after her victory at the British Amateur Championship at Royal Porthcawl in South Wales. Marlene went on to win the Australian, Canadian and U.S. Amateur Championships, the only female amateur to win all four. She was later inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2004 and the Canadian Golf Hall of Fame in 1971. The second recipient was Gary Cowan of Kitchener, a two-time U.S. Amateur Champion. Gary was inducted into the Canadian Golf Hall of Fame in 1972.\n21st century.\nThe Club also hosted The Four Nations Team Championship as Canada defeated squads from Australia, New Zealand and Japan in 2001. Alena Sharp won the 2004 Canadian PGA Women’s Championship. In the same year, the golf club completed a brand new clubhouse, in time for the club's 100th anniversary. \nOver the last Century, a number of noted golf course architects contributed some of their genius to the old course design including: A. W. Tillinghast, Harry Colt, Donald Ross, Stanley Thompson, Robbie Robinson, Graham Cooke, and Rees Jones in 2010. In 2014, the redesigned Lambton hosted the Toronto Star Amateur featuring the top amateurs in Ontario. Ryan Tsang of Cedar Brae G&amp;CC was the overall champion shooting 71-66-73-68 to win the tournament by 7 shots.\nIn 2015, Lambton co-hosted the Golf Canada Men's Golf Championship qualifying rounds. Four record 66's were shot on the 7,008 yard Championship Par 71 course. In the same year, on September 24, Lambton celebrated George Lyon's 111th Anniversary of his Olympic gold medal victory.\nLambton hosted the Ontario Men's Mid-Amateur Championship in June 2016. As of 2016, the Championship Course had five tee decks per hole and yardage ranging from 5300 to 7100 yards.\nTournaments hosted.\nLambton Golf and Country Club has hosted several major events in its history, including the Canadian Opens, and the Canadian Amateurs. The golf club has hosted both tournaments on four occasions. The golf club was a former rota course of the Canadian Open, hosting the tournament in 1907, 1910, 1925, and 1941. Winners of the Canadian Open in Lambton Golf and Country Club include:\nNoted golfers.\nLambton’s first golf captain, George Lyon, oversaw the completion of the championship 18-hole course with assistance from American golf course architect Tom Bendelow. The nine-hole Valley course, completed in 1904, may well have been the first course designed for lady golfers. It is also noteworthy that tennis has been played at the Club almost continuously since 1904. Lyon, who was born in 1858, remained Lambton’s captain for 23 years. He was an eight-time Canadian Amateur Champion (1898, 1900, 1903, 1905-06-07, 1912 and 1914), won the golf Gold Medal at the 1904 Olympics at The Glen Echo Country Club in St. Louis at the age of 46. He was also runner-up at the 1910 Canadian Open held at Lambton. He was inducted into the Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1955 and Canadian Golf Hall of Fame in 1971.\nIn 1913, Harry Vardon and Ted Ray put on an exhibition at Lambton on their way back to England from the U.S. Open Championship. After 72 holes of open play finished in a three-way tie, Ouimet, Vardon, and Ray went on to an 18-hole playoff the next day in rainy conditions, won by Ouimet. His victory was widely hailed as a stunning upset over the strongly-favored British, who were regarded as the top two golfers in the world. Francis Ouimet was immortalized the 2005 film \"The Greatest Game Ever Played\".\nThe 100th Anniversary of the Vardon, Ray, Cumming and Barrett match was re-enacted at Lambton on September 28, 2013 by the Lambton membership and the Golf Historical Society of Canada.\nIn 1903, Lambton appointed its first Head Professional, who came from Great Britain. Percy Barrett, 23 years old at the time, had tutelage under Harry Vardon. In 1907, he won the Canadian Open which was held at Lambton where he remained the Head Professional until 1914. In 1914 Willie Freeman, the assistant from the Toronto Golf Club was appointed. He left in 1923 when Andy Kay took the post. Kay finished tied for third in the 1925 Canadian Open held at Lambton.\nIn 1919, the Prince of Wales played Lambton. He later became King Edward VIII.\nIn 1934, Willie Lamb became the new Head Professional, a position he retained for the next 30 years, retiring in 1964. Lamb won may Canadian Championships including five CPGA Championships. Ted Devenish became Lambton's fourth Head Professional and held the position for 12 years. In 1977, Alan Ogilvie and his team (Dudley Jones, Charles Lorimer) came from Summerlea Golf Club in Montreal. Although he remained for only three years (moved on to be Director of Golf at Glen Abbey Golf Club in Oakville) his head assistant, Dudley Jones became the Head Professional holding the position for 23 years.\nIn 2003, Matthew Yustin and his team (Chris Vasey and Steve Manock) moved in and is the current Head Professional."

It followed MacPaint and was a competitor to Silicon Beach Software's SuperPaint. Like \"SuperPaint\" it was an early attempt to combine the separate graphic methods of bitmap and vector graphics.\nCricket Software already had a vector-only package called CricketDraw.\nThe way it achieved this dualism was with a feature called WetPaint. This allowed the user to draw vector graphics and modify them in an object-oriented way like in Apple's MacDraw, for example, changing the size, stroke and fill. When satisfied, the user could click outside the object and Cricket Paint would convert the vector graphic into a bitmap and place it on the canvas, in a destructive edit.\nThis package had some extra tools not found in MacPaint or MacDraw, such as the Spiral and Starburst, which drew radial lines.\nIt was also released for Microsoft Windows."

        "text": "Ben Ryan (born 11 September 1971) is an English sports coach who is best known for coaching the Fiji sevens team to a gold medal in sevens rugby at the 2016 Rio Olympics. He is currently Performance Director at association football club Brentford.\nAs Fiji's sevens coach from 2013 to 2016, he guided the team to their first ever Dubai 7s title, and set the record of tournament titles won by a Fiji Sevens coach with nine. He coached Fiji to win the inaugural rugby sevens competition at the 2016 Summer Olympics. The gold medal was the first ever medal won by Fiji at any Olympics.[1]\nHe is also a former coach of the England sevens team.\nYouth and education.\nRyan was educated at Strand on the Green Junior School and at Wimbledon College. He is a former member of Thames Valley Harriers Athletic Club, where he was a successful sprinter at school boy level.\nHe graduated from Loughborough University with a BSc in Sports science and Cambridge University (MPhil in Education), where he won two Blues as a scrum-half in the Varsity Match-winning sides of 1995 and 1996 as well as captaining the Light Blues’ Sevens team. He is a former teacher at St Edward's School, Oxford where he was master in charge of rugby and athletics.\nHe played club rugby with Nottingham and West Hartlepool.\nCoaching career.\nHe taught at St Edward's School, Oxford which, by the time he left after six years, had a player in every England international squad from Under-16 to Senior. Previously the school had no representation on international teams. He joined Newbury Blues in 2002 as backs coach and led them from National Division Two to One (Championship) in 2004–05 (his first season as full-time Director of Rugby). He was assistant coach to England Counties on their tour to Argentina and Uruguay in 2005 and head coach for the 35–7 victory over Tunisia in June 2007, and against Ireland Clubs and France Amateurs in March 2007.\nEngland Sevens.\nRyan's first IRB tournament as England Sevens coach was Wellington in 2007, and up to the Dubai Sevens 2012 he was in charge for 56 HSBC IRB World Series Sevens Tournaments, over 300 games – the longest serving England Sevens head coach – and reached the semi-finals or better 28 times. Outside the HSBC World Sevens Series he was also head coach for the 2009 RWC and 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi and in his last tournament in charge of England led them to their first Rugby World Cup 7s Final in 20 years, losing to New Zealand in the final.\nIn the FIRA European Series, he coached 7 tournaments and overall coached England in 67 international tournaments, a total of 378 games. In 2011, Ryan was also in charge of the England side that won the Junior Commonwealth Games in the Isle of Man, beating South Africa in the final 41–20.\nIn August 2013, he resigned as the coach of the England Sevens team and was replaced by Simon Amor.\nFiji Sevens.\nIn September 2013, Ryan was signed as the coach for the Fiji Sevens team.&lt;ref name=\"http://www.fijitimes.com\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He led them to victory in the Dubai 7s for the first time in the nation's history in only his second tournament in charge. His appointment also coincided with financial problems for the Fijian Rugby Union, resulting in Ryan's volunteering to go unpaid for several months of his contract.\nAs coach of Fiji, Ryan won nine World Sevens Series tournaments – two in the 2013–14 season and four in 2014–15, overtaking the record set by former coach Waisale Serevi, who won four Cup titles with Fiji. Fiji won three more tournaments in the 2015–16 season.\nIn May 2015, Fiji were crowned the overall winners of the 2014–15 Sevens World Series after defeating South Africa in the cup quarter final of the 2015 London Sevens, giving Ryan his first ever Sevens World Series title.\nAt the 2016 Summer Olympics, Ryan coached Fiji to a gold medal in the rugby sevens competition, where the team earned Fiji's first ever medal in the history of the Olympics.\nRyan confirmed that he would be stepping down as coach in 2016, but had not made any plans for the future. In August 2016, he was given the Fijian name Ratu Peni Rayani Latianara, along with three acres of land in Serua.\nOther roles.\nRyan has served France sevens as a consultant and runs his own consultancy business. He has worked as Technical Director of Rugby X and is an ambassador for Play-Ex Sports, HSBC and Fiji Airways. In June 2022, Ryan moved into association football when he was appointed to the newly-created role of Director of Elite Performance at Premier League club Brentford.\nHonours and awards.\nAfter winning gold and returning to Fiji, Ryan was accorded the highest order when he was awarded the Companion of the Order of Fiji. He is depicted on the reverse of a circulating 50 cent coin, and on the front of a circulating commemorative $7 banknote.\nPersonal life.\nRyan married Natalie Peck on 4 July 2009. They separated in September 2016 and were officially divorced on 2 August 2017. They had no children. In April 2022, he got engaged to Michelle Ackerley. Ryan is a Brentford supporter and was a season ticket holder at the club."

They played three Test matches against England and lost the series 2–0 with one match drawn. England won the First Test by 9 wickets at Lord's; the Second Test at Old Trafford was drawn; England won the Third Test at The Oval by 9 wickets.\nThe India team was captained by the Maharajkumar of Vizianagram, who was neither the greatest player nor the greatest captain of all time. But the team did include several top-class players such as Vijay Merchant, Mushtaq Ali and C. K. Nayudu.\nTouring party.\nThe India squad for the tour was suggested by the Selection Committee consisting of the Nawab of Bhopal Hamidullah Khan, the Nawab of Pataudi and Maharajkumar of Vizianagram to the Board of Cricket Control on 16 February 1936. The Maharajkumar was named the captain. The Yuvraj of Patiala Yadavindra Singh declined to be a part owing to personal reasons. Syed Mohammad Hadi was named the treasurer of the squad for the tour.\nControversy.\nAnother top-class player was Lala Amarnath but the tour was marred by controversy as recorded in A Right Royal Indian Mess on ESPNcricinfo, with Amarnath being sent home early for spurious \"disciplinary\" reasons. Ultimately, after a long saga of closed ranks and establishment incompetence, he was completely exonerated."

        "title": "Indian cricket team in England in 1946",
        "text": "The Indian national cricket team toured England in the 1946 season and played 29 first-class fixtures with 11 wins, 4 defeats and 14 draws. The 1946 season marked a return to normal first-class cricket in England following the end of World War II. The Test series between England and India was the first to be played in England since the West Indies tour in 1939. England won the series 1–0 with two matches drawn, their success largely due to the impact of debutant Alec Bedser who took 22 wickets in his first two Tests.\nConditions in 1946.\nThe Second World War in Europe having ended in May 1945, it was only possible to arrange eleven first-class matches in the 1945 English cricket season and so 1946, despite postwar recovery and continued rationing, was the first season in which a normal schedule of matches could be established in the County Championship and in Test cricket with the arrival of the Indian tourists.\nIn its review of the 1946 season, \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" remarked that \"the Indians were the first postwar touring side, and although they were outplayed in the Tests they raised the status and the dignity of their country's sport\". \"Wisden\" also mentioned that \"the weather in 1946 might have been dreadful, but it didn't stop the crowds flocking to games\". The state of the weather was mentioned by John Arlott who wrote his first match report for \"The Guardian\" when the Indians played Worcestershire at New Road, Worcester on 4, 6 and 7 May. Arlott wrote that \"New Road was bleak that Saturday morning... dark under the cloud, it was swept by a bitter gale howling across from Diglis\". In his review of the tour, S. Canynge Caple wrote that the Indian tourists were very popular, their tour returning a sizeable profit, because large crowds turned out when the weather was fine in an otherwise \"extremely dreary summer\".\nDerek Birley commented on the wider and political background to the tour. In January 1946, the Imperial Cricket Conference had drawn up a seven-year programme of Test series with India selected to make the first postwar tour of England. This, Birley remarked, despite the \"mounting political crisis at home\" and the grave shortage of equipment and clothing \"in rationed and straitened Britain\". It was the last Indian team before Partition and it presented a united front.\nIndian squad.\nIndia used a 16-man squad captained by Iftikhar Ali Khan, the Nawab of Pataudi, who was one of the few players to represent two countries in Test cricket, having played for England during the 1930s.\nSquad details below state the player's age at the beginning of the tour, his batting hand, his type of bowling, and his Ranji Trophy team at the time:\nThe team relied heavily on all-rounders and some of those listed above as batsmen or bowlers had all-round ability. All except Banerjee and Nimbalkar played in the Test series. The team was largely inexperienced at international level as only six players had made their Test debuts before the Second World War: Pataudi, Amarnath, Hindlekar, Merchant, Mushtaq Ali and Nayudu. In the first Test, which India lost heavily, the team had six debutants: Abdul Hafeez, Gul Mohammad, Hazare, Mankad, Modi and Shinde.\nEngland selections.\nEngland staged two Test trials, the first in June a week before the First Test and the second in July a week before the Second Test. It was seven years since England had last played a Test match and there was a winter tour of Australia to come so the selectors wanted to look at a large number of players to try and quickly establish the best possible team. A total of 35 players were used in the two Test trials and, in the end, England used 19 players in the three Test matches, with as many as 10 making only a single appearance.\nThe details for each player below state his age at the beginning of the Indian tour, his batting hand, his type of bowling, and his County Championship club at the time:\nTour itinerary.\nThe following is a list of the 33 matches played by the 1946 Indians. 29 including the three Test matches are recognised by \"ESPNcricinfo\" and \"CricketArchive\" as first-class fixtures: The four minor games are listed in \"italics\".\nTest series.\nEngland and India played three Tests between June and August. England won the series 1–0 with two matches drawn:\nFirst Test.\nMainstays of the England team who each played in all three Tests were captain Wally Hammond, opening batsmen Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook, middle order batsman Denis Compton and opening pace bowler Alec Bedser. For the first Test at Lord's, England had only three debutants compared with India's six. Bedser and batting all-rounder Jack Ikin were the only \"new\" players in that they had made two and five first-class appearances respectively before the war and each of them was now in his first full season. The third debutant was veteran seam bowler Frank Smailes who had been playing regularly for Yorkshire since 1932. England's other four players in this match were experienced pre-war players: batsman Joe Hardstaff junior, wicket-keeper Paul Gibb, leg spinner Doug Wright and pace bowler Bill Bowes.\nIndia's six debutants were Gul Mohammad, Abdul Hafeez, Vijay Hazare, Vinoo Mankad, Rusi Modi and Sadu Shinde. The rest of the team were captain Pataudi, who was making his first appearance for India; Lala Amarnath, Dattaram Hindlekar, Vijay Merchant and C. S. Nayudu.\nEngland won the first Test by a convincing ten wicket margin after Bedser took 11 wickets on debut and Hardstaff scored 205 not out. On each of the first two days the gates were closed about noon, when the crowds numbered nearly 30,000. Around 15,000 were present on the third day, on which the match finished at half past one. India won the toss and batted first but, with heavy rain having fallen, this proved anything but an advantage as the ground was wet throughout the first day to make run-scoring difficult. With the weather improving on the day prior to the start of the Test, the MCC predicted a start in accordance to the scheduled time of 11:30. \"Wisden\" says that Bedser maintained an admirable length at fast-medium pace, using swerve or spin to turn the ball appreciably from the sodden turf. Hardstaff's innings was one of great concentration and gave him his highest score in Test cricket after five and a quarter hours batting. He had great support from Gibb in a stand of 182 for the fifth wicket and some useful tailend contributions, especially by Smailes. India began the third day only 66 behind with six wickets in hand but Bedser and Wright caused a collapse which left England needing only 48 to win.\nSecond Test.\nEngland made team changes for the second Test in view of the need to try out several players ahead of the winter tour of Australia. Pace bowler Dick Pollard was introduced, making his Test debut in place of Smailes. Like Smailes, Pollard was an experienced player active since 1933. Veteran pace bowler Bill Voce was recalled in place of his former bodyline series colleague Bowes. India made three changes with Syed Mushtaq Ali, Chandra Sarwate and Ranga Sohoni coming in for Gul Mohammad, Shinde and Nayudu.\nThe second Test was drawn but it had a tense climax as India's last wicket pair Sohoni and Hindlekar held on for the final 13 minutes of play to secure the draw with England 125 runs ahead. Bedser again took 11 wickets and Pollard weighed in with 7. Compton, with two half centuries, was the top scorer.\nThe start of the match was delayed by rain and Pataudi was criticised by \"Wisden\" for asking England to bat on a \"dead wicket\" after he won the toss. England began with an opening stand of 81 between Hutton and Washbrook; they comfortably reached 236 for four at the close on Saturday evening. More rain fell and on Monday morning, India were able to take advantage of wet conditions, bowling England out for 294 with six wickets in an hour, England adding only another 58. India's batsmen were expected to struggle but Merchant and Mushtaq Ali began with a stand of 124, batting well into the afternoon, and then a collapse took place with Pollard enjoying a spell of five overs which realised four wickets for only seven runs and India after their bright start could only manage 160 for seven at the close. The weather relented on the final day and play began on time in bright sunshine, England soon disposing of the remaining Indian wickets. England hoped to score quickly to enable a declaration but Amarnath and Mankad bowled economically and kept the run rate down. Eventually, England declared and left needing India 278 in three hours, a target that \"practically vanished\" when Merchant was out second ball to Pollard. Bedser had a devastating spell after the tea break, reducing India to 138 for nine with only thirteen minutes left, but Sohoni and Hindlekar managed to hold on for the draw.\nThird Test.\nEngland made six changes for the third Test, which was drawn after being ruined by rain. Batsmen Laurie Fishlock, Bill Edrich and James Langridge were recalled along with fast bowler Alf Gover. There were two debutants: wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans and Essex spinner Peter Smith who had been the subject of a hoax call-up in 1933. They replaced Ikin, Hardstaff, Gibb, Voce, Pollard and Wright. India made a single change, recalling Nayudu in place of Sarwate.\nPlay on the first day (a Saturday) could not begin until five o'clock and \"Wisden\" commented that it would not have been attempted then \"but for the crowds of people who waited around the walls from early in the morning\". About 10,000 people watched the evening session in which Merchant and Mushtaq Ali opened for India and scored 79 without loss. The partnership ended with a run out on Monday morning at 94 and India then lost three more wickets to reach 122 for four at lunch. Merchant was run out having scored a \"masterful\" 128. Edrich, who bowled straight with some off breaks, was the most effective English bowler while Pataudi relied on Amarnath and Mankad. It rained again on the Tuesday and the match was abandoned as a draw at lunchtime.\nOther matches.\nIn the Indians' match against Surrey beginning on 11 May, in their first innings a last wicket partnership of 249 between Sarwate and Banerjee took the score from 205/9 to 454 all out. This is still the second highest last wicket partnership in all first-class cricket, the highest in England and the highest partnership between numbers 10 and 11. (The only higher last wicket partnership was between numbers 4 and 11.) Sarwate and Banerjee came together with the score at 205/9 and took just over three hours to add 249 before Banerjee was out for 121, leaving Sarwate not out on 124. It was also the only time in first-class cricket that numbers 10 and 11 both scored a century in the same innings. Nayudu took a hat-trick in the Surrey first innings and Surrey were forced to follow-on. They saved the innings defeat but, with Sarwate taking 5–54 in the second innings, the Indians were left with only 20 needed to win.\nStatistical summary.\nThe outstanding batsman for the Indians was Vijay Merchant who scored 2,385 runs on the tour with a highest score of 242* among seven centuries at an average of 74.53. Hazare, Modi and Mankad all exceeded 1,000 runs on the tour while Pataudi was just nineteen shy of it. The Indians scored 21 centuries, Merchant accounting for a third of these. Pataudi had four and Mankad three. India's fielding was generally criticised, mostly for dropped catches, but Mankad with 21 catches was the best fielder. Hindlekar kept wicket in 19 games, holding 22 catches and completing 14 stumpings. His deputy Nimbalkar played in eight games with 12 catches and seven stumpings.\nMankad with 129 wickets was easily the best bowler and he achieved a season \"double\". Next best were Amarnath and Hazare with 56 wickets apiece. Mankad's seven for 37 was the best innings performance by an Indian bowler.\nVinoo Mankad was elected one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in the 1947 \"Wisden\" along with England players Bedser, Fishlock, Peter Smith and Washbrook. His colleagues Pataudi and Merchant had won the award in 1932 and 1937 respectively.\nAftermath.\nIndia was not involved in international cricket in the 1946–47 season, either as hosts or tourists, and so the 1946 Test series in England was the last played by India before Partition was effected on 14 and 15 August 1947, resulting in formation of the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan as sovereign states. There were no tours to India in the 1947–48 season and the Indian team went to Australia from October to February, playing a series of five Tests in which they were defeated 4–0.\nThe 1947–48 team in Australia included seven of the 1946 team: Amarnath (now the captain), Gul Mohammad, Hazare, Mankad, Nayudu, Sarwate and Sohoni. Gul Mohammad later played for Pakistan. His 1946 colleague Abdul Hafeez, who changed his name to Abdul Kardar, became Pakistan's first Test captain in October 1952."

        "title": "Indian cricket team in England in 1959",
        "text": "The Indian cricket team toured England in the 1959 season. The team played five Test matches against England and lost them all: the first time that England had won all the matches in a five-match series. Only one of the Tests, the game at Manchester, went into the fifth day.\nIn all first-class matches, the Indian team won just six times and lost 11, with 16 of the 33 games left drawn.\nThe background.\nIndia's first tour of England since 1952 came with the Indian side in transition. A home series against West Indies in 1958-59 had been lost 3–0, and there had been four captains in the five Tests. Three of those four, Ghulam Ahmed, Vinoo Mankad and Hemu Adhikari, retired from Test cricket after that series and the 1959 touring party included a lot of unproven players.\nEngland has also had a chastening experience in the run-up to the 1959 Test series. Having retained The Ashes in 1956, overcome the West Indies' Ramadhin and Valentine combination in 1957, and crushed New Zealand in 1958, the team had been full of confidence that The Ashes would be retained in Australia in 1958–59. In the event, the tour was a disaster, and Australia won 4–0.\nThe Indian team.\nThe team consisted of 17 players, and that rose to 18 when Abbas Ali Baig was recruited at the end of the Oxford University cricket season to take the place of the injured Vijay Manjrekar. The team was captained by Datta Gaekwad and managed by the Maharaja of Baroda, himself a cricketer for Baroda and at 29 younger than several of the team.\nThe team was:\nGaekwad, Roy, Manjrekar and Umrigar had been members of the 1952 Indian team in England. Though the team as a whole was not experienced, all except Apte, Baig, Jaisimha and Muddiah had played Test cricket before the tour, and 17 of the 18 players appeared in the 1959 Test series. The exception was Muddiah, who remained uncapped by India until the following winter.\nThe Test Matches.\nFirst Test.\nEngland began nervously against Surendranath and Desai, but Peter May hit 106 and 50s from Ken Barrington, Martin Horton (in his first Test) and a quickfire 73 from Godfrey Evans meant that the hosts ended the first day at 358 for six wickets. India began very slowly, and Tommy Greenhough, in his first Test also, conceded 16 runs in his first 16 overs, also taking the first wicket, that of Contractor. Two wickets for Fred Trueman were followed by late rain, and on the third day Borde was unable to resume his innings, having broken a finger the previous evening. India's batting, with Nadkarni also handicapped by injury, subsided against hostile bowling from Trueman, Brian Statham and Alan Moss, and the innings of 206 took 375 minutes and 102.5 overs. Only Roy reached 50, and in the follow-on he made a further 49. But apart from Manjrekar (44), Gaekwad (31) and Umrigar (20) no other batsman reached double figures, and Borde was unable to bat. The match finished at 3.30 on the fourth day.\nSecond Test.\nGaekwad, Borde and Nadkarni were injured, so Roy captained India. Contractor, hit by Statham, batted with a cracked rib but still made almost half of India's first innings runs, with a determined 81. Greenhough took five for 35 as the last six wickets fell for just 24 runs. The Indian bowlers then hit back and reduced England to 80 for six, but Ken Barrington, with 80, found unlikely batting allies in Statham and Moss, so England claimed a lead of 58. Trueman dismissed Roy and Umrigar in the first over and though Manjrekar and Kripal Singh added 89 for the fifth wicket, the last six wickets fell this time for 34 and England required only 108, which an unbeaten 63 from Colin Cowdrey easily achieved.\nThird Test.\nEngland made six changes and one of the newcomers, Harold Rhodes, took wickets with his fourth and twelfth balls in Test cricket to reduce India to 23 for four, with new wicketkeeper Roy Swetman taking three catches. Later Indian batsmen did better, but no one reached 30 on a bland wicket. England's new opening pair of Gilbert Parkhouse and Geoff Pullar put on 146 for the first wicket, and then Cowdrey and Barrington put on 193 for the fourth wicket, Cowdrey going on to make 160. After early wickets for Moss and Trueman, India rallied with a partnership of 69 between Borde and Umrigar before the off-spin pairing of Brian Close and John Mortimore finished things off by five o'clock on the third day.\nFourth Test.\nPullar became the first Lancashire player to hit a century in an Old Trafford Test, and MJK Smith made 100 as well. With 87 from Barrington and 67 from Cowdrey, England made the highest total of the series. Surendranath took five for 115 in 47.1 overs. India's batting again let them down, though Borde made 75 and guided the tail to a total of more than 200. Cowdrey, captaining England as Peter May was ill (he underwent an operation during the match), did not enforce the follow-on, but England batted with little urgency. Parkhouse, Barrington, Ted Dexter and Ray Illingworth each passed 40, but none of them reached 50. The declaration set India 547 to win. A second wicket stand of 109 between Contractor, who made 56, and Baig, who was making his debut, was India's best of the series. Baig reached 85 when he was struck on the head by a bouncer from Rhodes and had to retire. He was able to resume the next morning and, in partnership with Umrigar, threatened to save or even win the match. Both reached centuries – Baig in his first Test, Umrigar's the only one he ever made in England – but once Baig had been run out for 112, the innings quickly folded, Umrigar being eighth out for 118.\nFifth Test.\nEngland completed the 5-0 whitewash by lunch on the fourth day. India batted poorly against Trueman and Statham and only a late partnership of 58 for the eighth wicket between Tamhane and Surendranath brought any comfort. The innings occupied five hours and 85.3 overs. England relied on a third wicket partnership of 169 between Raman Subba Row, who made 94, and MJK Smith (98), and then Illingworth and Swetman made maiden Test 50s in putting on 102 for the seventh wicket. India's second innings was more spirited than their first, with Nadkarni making 76 in four hours, but the result was not in doubt.\nOther first-class matches.\nIf fragile batting was one of the weaknesses of the touring side, then occasional individual batting successes were responsible for several of the team's six victories in other first-class matches. Double-centuries for Umrigar and Manjrekar were behind the wins against the two first-class university sides, and Umrigar made another double-century in the win against Northamptonshire (as well as one in the drawn match with Somerset). The Middlesex victory came against a side with many regulars absent, and only towards the end of the tour, in the wins against Glamorgan and Kent, did the side perform satisfactorily as a team.\nOnly three counties defeated the tourists and in one of those, the match against Gloucestershire at Cheltenham, the pitch deteriorated over the course of the three days (which made Roy's decision to put the county in rather strange). Representative matches against MCC and a full-strength international side assembled by T. N. Pearce for the Scarborough festival were also lost. And the Indians became the first touring side to lose against the Minor Counties representative side since the West Indian cricket team in England in 1928, largely as a result of a remarkable unbeaten 202 by Phil Sharpe that enabled the Minor Counties to reach a target of 334 with only four wickets lost.\nIn a hot and sunny summer with a lot of runs in all forms of cricket, 16 matches were drawn.\nLeading players.\nThe Indian team's Test match averages and aggregates in a depressing series were a long way below those of the England players. Eight England team members who batted three or more times in the series averaged more than 50 runs per innings; three bowlers took 14 or more wickets and averaged less than 20 runs per wicket. Brian Statham had the unusual distinction of heading both batting and bowling averages, though his average of 70 with the bat reflected the fact that he was dismissed only once in three innings. Fred Trueman, scourge of the Indian cricket team in England in 1952, took most wickets with 24 at 16.70.\nBaig headed India's batting with 165 runs from four innings; Contractor scored most runs, 233. The leg-spinner Gupte took 17 wickets at an average of 34.64, but the leading bowler by average was Surendranath, whose 16 wickets cost 26.62 each.\nOn the tour as a whole, Manjrekar's unbeaten 204 against Oxford University enabled him to head not only the tourists' averages, but the averages for all players in the first-class season. He scored 755 runs at an average of 68.63. Umrigar's three double-centuries, including the tour highest, 252 not out against Cambridge University, brought him the highest aggregate: 1,826 runs at 55.33 runs per innings. Of the other batsmen, Gaekwad, Contractor, Roy and Borde passed 1,000 runs in all first-class matches, and Baig did so if his tour aggregate was added to his university runs earlier in the season. Of the younger batsmen, Apte and Kripal Singh each had one very large innings, but Ghorpade and Jaisimha failed to score a century.\nBorde was in terms of averages and strike rate the most successful bowler, his 72 wickets costing 20.62 runs each. Gupte, heralded before the tour as the leading leg-spin bowler in the world, disappointed, and failed to take 100 wickets in the season: his aggregate of 95 was the highest for the tourists, however. Nadkarni was a useful off-spinner but he lacked penetration and was used primarily defensively. The two young opening bowlers, Surendranath and Desai, both of them barely above medium pace, had contrasting seasons: Surendranath impressed with his control and reliability and took 79 wickets at 28 each, but Desai was expensive and his 45 tour wickets cost 41.42 runs apiece. Muddiah barely played, Ghorpade barely bowled, and Jaisimha was several times pressed into service as an emergency opening bowler without ever looking suited to the role.\nJoshi and Tamhane shared wicketkeeping duties throughout the tour, playing in three and two Tests respectively. Ghorpade and Borde attracted favourable comment for their fielding.\nVerdict and aftermath.\nWisden Cricketers' Almanack for 1960, reporting on the tour, said that the record of the team was even worse than that of the New Zealand cricket team in England in 1958, which was itself regarded as the worst in living memory. It suggested that the problem was deep-seated, in that the side appeared only rarely to play as a team, though talented individuals made occasional contributions.\nUnder a new captain, Gulabrai Ramchand, India gave a much more creditable account of themselves in a home series the following winter against Australia, losing the series only 2–1, though the single victory came in a match at Kanpur on a newly-laid pitch that off-spinner Jasubhai Patel exploited to the extent of taking 14 wickets in the match."

This was India's first ever series win in England. The First Test at Lord's and the Second Test at Old Trafford were drawn. India pulled off a historic win in the Third Test at The Oval by 4 wickets after being 71 behind on first innings. They bowled England out for only 101 in the second innings with Bhagwat Chandrasekhar claiming 6–38.\nThe Indian team was captained by Ajit Wadekar. Besides Wadekar and Chandrasekhar, the team included other notable players in Dilip Sardesai, Srinivasaraghavan Venkataraghavan, Gundappa Viswanath, Bishan Singh Bedi and the young Sunil Gavaskar. Farokh Engineer, who had a contract with Lancashire, was made available for the Tests and a few other matches.\nBackground.\nWith South Africa out of Test cricket, England was arguably the best cricket team in the world at this point of time. Earlier in the summer, they had fortuitously managed to defeat Pakistan 1–0 but coming into the series England had gone 24 Tests without defeat. They were to extend it to a record 26 Test matches before losing the third Test.\nIndia had not won a Test abroad till 1968 and had had no success in their previous six Test tours of England. However, under the new captain Ajit Wadekar, India defeated West Indies in an away series in early 1971. The victory in that series was built around the batting of Sunil Gavaskar and Dilip Sardesai who scored 774 and 642 runs respectively. Chandrasekhar had been a controversial omission from the West Indies series. Chief Selector Vijay Merchant called his inclusion for the tour of England \"a calculated gamble\".\nTouring party.\nM.

Snow picked it up and handed it to me. But at the time, many papers wrote that Snow had flung the bat at me. It all depends on your point of view, or what you are trying to portray... – Sunil Gavaskar\" Picture\nThe England fast bowler John Snow rescued the England first innings when he came in at 183/7 and made 73 to hoist the total up to 304. This was Snow's highest Test and joint-equal highest first-class score, but he was disappointed not to realise his boyhood dream of a century at Lord's when he was caught off a B. S. Chandrasekhar googly. India needed 183 to win in the fourth innings when Snow had the opener Ashok Mankad caught by Alan Knott for 8 and India were 21/2 when Sunil Gavaskar was called for a quick single after hitting the ball to mid-wicket. Snow went for the ball and knocked him over, \"I could imagine the horror on the faces of everybody watching the game from the committee room at Lord's\". They were both uninjured and continued with the game, and Snow tossed Gavaskar's bat back to him. A similar incident had happened in Georgetown in 1967–68 with Clive Lloyd, but the 5'5\" Indian received far more sympathy than the 6'4\" West Indian who knocked Snow to the ground. From afar the incident had looked much worse and was replayed repeatedly on slow-motion television. A media furore ensued and with press demanding disciplinary action. The replay can be seen in the Indian episode of the BBC documentary Empire of Cricket and it certainly appears that Snow recklessly barged into the Gavaskar. Many were more angry about the throwing of the bat back than the knocking him over in the first place. At lunch, Snow returned to the dressing room and apologised to the chairman of selectors Alec Bedser and promised to do so to Gavaskar when an enraged Billy Griffith charged in and shouted \"That's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen on the field\". Ray Illingworth took him out and Snow waited until he had calmed down before apologising to Gavaskar after lunch. When he later saw the replay he said, \"Oh well, the scene's been far too quiet without me anyway\" and realised he could not avoid being dropped for the Second Test. The game was rained off with India needed 38 runs to win, but England wanting only two wickets for victory.\nThird Test.\nSnow returned for the Third Test and tore off Gavaskar's chain and medallion with a bouncer that zipped under his chin and made him fall over. He bowled the Indian for 6 in the first innings and had him lbw for a duck in the second, but this was not enough to prevent India winning the Test and the series by four wickets. It ended England's run of 26 Tests without loss.\nOther matches.\nv Middlesex.\nEric Russell and Mike Smith added 89 for the first wicket after Mike Brearley won the toss and batted. Russell, dropped three times, became the third batsman – after John Jameson and Zaheer Abbas – to complete 1,000 runs for the season. He was caught at mid-off for 84 in three and a half hours. Middlesex, 164 for 2 at the time of Russell's dismissal, was all out for 233. John Price took the wickets of Abbas Ali Baig and Ajit Wadekar off successive balls as India ended the first day on 41 for 3. They slid further to 94 for 6 before Viswanath and Abid Ali added 76 runs in an hour. Going in second with a 65-run lead, Middlesex lost five wickets for 20 runs in 40 minutes after tea. Bedi took 6 for 29 and India needed 197 to win. Price took two wickets off consecutive balls for the fourth day in a row, Sunil Gavaskar and Dilip Sardesai being the batsmen this time. This time the first five wickets fell for 79 but Eknath Solkar and Abid Ali added 56 and Bedi finished the match pulling Peter Parfitt for four. On a wearing wicket, Middlesex missed Fred Titmus who had been rested.\nv Essex.\nThe match was played in very English conditions – the wicket hardly differed foom the outfield, there was a near gale-force wind and it rained. Keith Boyce dismissed Gavaskar with the last ball of the first over. John Lever hit Jayantilal on the boot with his first ball, had Wadekar caught behind off the fifth, and yorked Viswanath with the second ball of his second over. None of the batsmen scored and India was 3 for 4 after 20 balls. India eventually ended up with 164. In the Essex reply, Keith Fletcher scored his third hundred of the season in 223 minutes. Just before the declaration, Lever hit 37 in 25 minutes with 2 fours and 3 sixes. After reaching 163 for 3 an hour before tea on the final day, India lost five wickets in 20 overs. Essex needed 68 in 18 overs and managed it just in time.\nv DH Robins' XI.\nSardesai, Venkataraghavan and Solkar were rested and Govindraj played his first match. He took 2 for 20 in 12 overs in his opening spell. By tea, Robins' XI had lost seven wickets for 148. Chris Old and Kerry O'Keeffe added 71 for the ninth wicket when the innings was declared half an hour before the close. Still trying to solve the problem of the opening batsmen, India picked all the four openers in the touring party. Gavaskar and Baig opened, Jayantilal went in at one down and Mankad at five. After the quick exit of Baig and Jayantilal, Wadekar scored 45 with nine fours, four of them in a Greig over. Viswanath scored a hundred in 200 minutes with 15 fours. Robins' XI declared just before tea setting India 182 in around two hours. Baig scored 38 with six fours after which the match ended in a draw.\nv Kent.\nVenkataraghavan captained the Indians. Dropped on 19, Brian Luckhurst scored 118 in three and a half hours with 15 fours and a six off Venkat. Luckhurst and Mike Denness made 125 for the first wicket and were separated just after lunch. Luckhurst was the fourth man out at 209 but Alan Knott and West Indian John Shepherd then added 96 runs quickly. Gavaskar had been rested, and the Indian openers were dismissed before close on the first day. The first five fell for 52 but yet again the lower half of the Indian batting outscored the top order. Despite a lead of 228, Denness chose to bat again and set Indians 408 to win in over a day. On a very cold final day, Viswanath and Ashok Mankad took the score to 137 for 1 at lunch but Shepherd dismissed Mankad and Sardesai in one over. Viswanath, however, scored his second successive hundred and shielded the later batsmen.\nv Leicestershire.\nThis match proved to be the turning point for the Indians who now began to win consistently. The match was played in warm sunshine before a crowd that included many Indians. Barry Dudleston and David Steele began with a stand of 50 runs in an hour before Chandra caught and bowled Steele. Baig ran Dudleston out for 51 and Solkar took a spectacular catch at short squareleg to dismiss Brian Davison. Leicestershire were dismissed before tea for 198. Gavaskar and Wadekar added 231 for the second wicket. Wadekar once swung Jack Birkenshaw over fineleg, shattering the window panes. India was 120 for 1 at close on the first day, and added another 125 without loss before lunch on the second. Wadekar was well caught by Birkenshaw at short midwicket having made 126 with 18 fours and the six. Gavaskar made 165 in five and a half fours with 21 fours. India declared after tea with a lead of 218. Leicestershire lost quick wickets on the last day before Chris Balderstone and Roger Tolchard added 72 for the fifth wicket. Tolchard was dropped by Solkar but Gavaskar had him caught at slip. The match ended ten minutes after lunch. Chandra returned figures of 5 for 63 and 6 for 64 (11 for 127).\nv Warwickshire.\nIndians recovered from a bad start to win by an innings. On the first day Jameson set about the Indian bowling to score 231 in 265 minutes with 31 fours and four sixes – one each off Bedi, Govindraj, Abid Ali and Prasanna. India rested Chandra for the match. Warwickshire scored 130 without loss in 30 overs before lunch on the first day. Bedi dismissed John Whitehouse and Rohan Kanhai in four balls. Jameson and Smith then added 241 in 149 minutes. Jameson was dropped at 132 and 143. On the latter occasion, Prasanna let the ball go off his hands for six, Govindraj being the bowler. After Warwickshire declared at the fall of Jameson, India made 94 for two on the first day, and another 416 runs on the second. Wadekar and Sardesai made 144 for the third wicket and Sardesai and Viswanath 118 for the fourth wicket. Sardesai scored 120 and Viswanath missed his third consecutive century by ten runs. India batted into the third day for Abid Ali to score a hundred. He missed it by seven runs and India was all out for 562. It was India's highest first class score in England. Jameson fell early, caught hooking Abid Ali. Bedi and Prasanna shared the other nine wickets as Warwickshire lost by an innings. India defeated Warwickshire for the first time in seven attempts.\nv Glamorgan.\nFarokh Engineer was released by Lancashire to play in this match. Wadekar won his fourth toss in successive matches. Several Indian batsmen had a good start without going on to make a big score. Engineer top-scored making 62 of the 94 runs added by the last six wickets. Sixteen wickets fell on the second day. Majid Khan played a fine innings of 78 with 11 fours before Bedi bowled his with an arm-ball. But the last six Glamoran wickets added only 25. Venkataraghavan took 6 for 76. India lost the first three for 46 but Wadekar scored 73. Venkataraghavan made 57 including a six off Peter Walker. Needing 337 in the second innings, Glamorgan closed the second day on 11 for no loss. On the final day, Engineer missed two chances from Malcolm Nash who was also dropped by Baig. Nash top scored with 75. After being 185 for four at tea, Glamorgan were all out for 224. This time Bedi took six wickets. Both he and Venkat took nine wickets in the match.\nv Hampshire.\nFor the last match before the first Test, India rested Bedi and Chandra who were both expected to be in Test side. The choice of the third spinner was between Prasanna and Venkat. Prasanna took 3 for 37 in the first innings while Venkat had 1 for 76. But in the second innings Venkat returned career best figures of 9 for 93. He only missed the ninth wicket of the innings, Larry Worrell being dismissed by Solkar. This was to remain as the best bowling figures for the 1971 season. Prasanna took 0/81 in 33 overs. Venkat went on to play all the three Test matches while Prasanna did not appear in any.\nHampshire played without their regular opener Roy Marshall and fast bowler Bob Cottam. Barry Richards started off with two fours being well caught and bowled by Solkar. Hampshire was all out for 198 before tea. On the second day Mankad scored a century in five hours while Viswanath scored his third hundred of the tour. Richards scored 45 including a six off Venkat while the other opener Richard Lewis top scored with 71 in 165 minutes and a six off Prasanna. Captain Richard Gilliat scored his second 50 of the match, batting only 135 minutes for 71 with ten fours and a six. India won by five wickets for their fourth win in a row.\nv Minor Counties.\nIt rained for 14 hours before the scheduled start of the match and there was no play on the first day. Minor Counties declared at tea on the second day at 203. India in turn declared on 252, Solkar's 44* with two sixes and five fours being a bright knock. The match ended in a tame draw.\nv Surrey.\nThe wicket provided little help to spinners and India rested Chandra and Venkataraghavan. Surrey, who were to win the County Championship in 1971, had Geoff Arnold, who was the twelfth man in the second Test, and Bob Willis. Graham Roope added 61 for the fourth wicket with Younis Ahmed and 63 with Intikhab Alam for the sixth wicket. Roope hit a six off Prasanna and six fours; Intikhab, two sixes off Bedi. Prasanna who had just recovered from a flu bowled all over the place but Bedi took 7 for 111.\nIndia scored 28 runs in 90 minutes on the first day and took three hours to reach hundred. The crowd responded with slow hand clap. Mankad then hit four fours in three overs but got out for 77. Jayantilal scored only 36 runs in first two sessions on the second day. He was eventually run out for 84 in five hours and 11 fours. There was little point left in the match after India's declaration on the last day.\nv Yorkshire.\nIndia won the toss and batted. Wadekar top scored with 50 in 85 minutes, out of 145 all out. Yorkshire reached 137 for 3 by lunch on the second day. Rain washed out the rest of the match.\nv Nottinghamshire.\nThe first seven hours of the match were rained off. India declared at 168 for 7 and Nottinghamshire, who had rested Garry Sobers, in turn declared immediately after saving the follow on. Following a third declaration after lunch on the third day, Notts had a target of 245 in 110 minutes plus 20 overs. At tea, they were 75 for two, and 94/4 at the start of the mandatory 20 overs. Though the sixth wicket fell with four overs left, Nottinghamshire saved the match.\nChandra took all six wickets in the second innings for figures of 20-8-34-6. These were curiously similar to his bowling in the third Test that began two days later.\nv Sussex.\nIndians started this match the day after the finish of the third Test and were to spend the next three days playing Somerset at Taunton. Gavaskar scored 37 in 42 minutes with eight fours. Solkar, promoted to No. 4, made 90 in 215 minutes with nine fours and was the last man out. After the first six wickets fell for 126, he added 71 with Kirmani for the seventh wicket. Tony Greig took four wickets while John Snow failed to get any.\nMike Buss and Geoff Greenidge scored 199 before the first wicket fell. Buss who was 15 at the end of the first day reached his hundred before lunch on the second, out of 154. His eventual 140 was scored in 195 minutes with two sixes and eighteen does. Greenidge took 205 minutes for 62. Prasanna took 5 for 137 which was his best bowling for the tour in what was to be his last match. Sussex took a lead of 146.\nIndians batted dourly to save the match. Jayantilal took three and a half hours for his 57 while Viswanath took two and a half for his 38. Indians were only 29 ahead when the seventh wicket fell and eighty minutes remained. Kirmani and D. Govindraj played out the time.\nv Somerset.\nIndia went from 31/0 to 57/4 with Tom Cartwright taking all the wickets. Solkar was dropped on 17, and survived again when Peter Robinson stepped on the ropes while taking a catch. Cartwright also dismissed Abbas Ali Baig after a fifth wicket stand of 71. He took 5/72 in a single spell of 29 overs. Solkar and Abid Ali added 134 for the sixth wicket. Solkar made 113 in 170 minutes with 18 fours and a six. India declared 22 minutes into the second day when Abid completed his hundred. He took 145 minutes over it and hit two sixes and 15 fours.\nBad light affected play on the first two days and there was no result despite two declarations on the final day. Brian Close scored his fifth hundred of the season, scoring 103* in 210 minutes with 15 fours. Somerset declared 123 runs behind. Wadekar made 74 (12 fours and one six) for India in the second innings. Somerset were 38/1 at tea and ended on 127/2. Cartwright completed a hundred wickets in a season for the eighth time and was awarded a silver tankard.\nv Worcestershire.\nWadekar and Gavaskar started the match with tour aggregates of 909 and 811 runs. Just before tea on the first day, Wadekar completed his 1000. At the break he was 98 not out. After Jayantilal fell for two, Wadekar and Gavaskar added 327 for the second wicket. It was a record for the English season, improving on 301 by Phil Sharpe and Doug Padgett for Yorkshire against Glamorgan. Wadekar hit 16 fours, two sixes off Kevin Griffith in his 150 in 321 minutes. His hundred took 234 minutes. India ended the first day on 363 for 2, Gavaskar 188 not out.\nGavaskar completed his thousand on the second morning but fell for 194. It was the highest score made for the Indians in the tour. The declaration came soon after at 383 for 3. Worcestershire's fifth wicket fell at 92 but John Parker and Keith Wilkinson added 100 for the sixth wicket. The 19-year-old Parker making his debut for the county, scored 91 and would go on to captain New Zealand. India declared at lunch on the final day 285 ahead and 210 minutes left. Worcestershire fell 40 runs short with Jim Yardley reaching a century.\nv TN Pearce's XI.\nTom Pearce's XI put up 357 for 3 on the first day. Roy Virgin made a stylish century (176), adding 155 with Brian Bolus for the first wicket and 146 with Keith Fletcher for the third. Bolus was run out by Viswanath. Mankad carried his bat for 154* for India. He scored his fifty in 140 minutes and hundred in over four hours. Solkar hit a half century in 70 minutes.\nPearce's XI made 87 for one at the end of the second day. Bolus hit a six and 14 fours in 106*. Set 251 in 240 minutes after a declaration, India won with half an hour to spare. Gavaskar scored 128 in 155 minutes with ten fours and four sixes. He brought up his fifty in 65 minutes and hundred in 120, hitting Peter Parfitt for two sixes and a four in one over and Brian Close for a six and a four off consecutive balls in another."

        "text": "The Indian cricket team toured England in the 1974 English domestic cricket season. After matches against many of county cricket and other minor teams, in April and May, the Indian team played three Test matches and two One-day Internationals against the England cricket team. The tour was a total disaster for the Indian cricket team with England winning all five of the matches.\nThe season became known as the \"Summer of 42\", referring to the number of runs scored by India in its second innings in the Second Test at Lord's (also a reference to the film \"Summer of '42\" which won an Oscar in 1972; a follow-up, \"Class of '44\" had been released in 1973). Blamed for his team's poor showing, Indian captain Ajit Wadekar retired from Test cricket after the tour.\nBackground.\nIndia could make a fair claim in the early 1970s to be the top Test-playing nation. In 1970–71, the team had beaten the West Indies in the Caribbean; in the English season that followed, 1971, the team had won its first-ever victory on English soil and with it the first series victory in Anglo-Indian Tests in England; and that victory was repeated, with a 2–1 margin, when MCC toured India in 1972–73.\nThe basis of India's success was the quartet of world-class spin bowlers – Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, Bishen Singh Bedi, Erapalli Prasanna and Srinivas Venkataraghavan – backed up by world-class batting from Sunil Gavaskar and Gundappa Vishwanath. Ajit Wadekar was regarded as an astute captain, while Farokh Engineer was an extrovert wicketkeeper-batsman.\nTest matches.\nFirst Test.\nIn the First Test, played from 6 June to 11 June at Old Trafford, England won the toss and batted first, scoring 328-9 declared, with a century for Keith Fletcher (123). Indian opening batsman Sunil Gavaskar scored 101 in India's reply of 246 all out, assisted by 71 added down the batting order by Abid Ali. England reached 213–3 in their second innings, declaring with John Edrich on 100 not out. India were bowled out a second time for 182, and England won by 113 runs.\nSecond Test.\nIn the Second Test, played from 21 June to 24 June at Lord's, England again won the toss and batted first, scoring a monumental 629 all out, with centuries for opening batsman Dennis Amiss (188), captain Mike Denness (118), and Tony Greig (106); in addition, John Edrich was out for 96. Indian spin bowler Bishen Bedi took six wickets, but conceded 226 runs in 64.2 overs. In reply, India scored 302 all out. Called to follow on, India were dismissed a second time for only 42, and England won by an innings and 285 runs inside 4 days. Chris Old took 5-21, to add to his 4–67 in the first innings, and Geoff Arnold took 4–19.\nThird Test.\nIn the Third Test, played from 3 July to 8 July at Edgbaston, India won the toss and batted first, scoring 165 all out. Wicket-keeper Farokh Engineer top scored with 64 not out. English reached 459 for 2 declared in reply, with David Lloyd scoring 214 not out, Mike Denness dismissed for exactly 100. India were bowled out for 216 in their second innings, and England won by an innings and 78 runs.\nODI matches.\nFirst ODI.\nThe First ODI was played on 13 July at Headingley. England won the toss and put India in to bat. India scored 265 all out, bowled out with 7 balls to bowl. England reached their victory target with 6 wickets down and 23 balls to spare.\nSecond ODI.\nIn the Second ODI, played on 16 July at the Oval, India won the toss and batted. They scored 171 all out in 47.3 overs. England reached their victory target with 4 wickets down and over 6 overs to spare."

        "text": "The Indian cricket team toured England in the 1990 season and played 14 first-class matches including three Tests. They also played in two limited overs internationals. England won the Test series 1–0 with two matches drawn. The Indian team was captained by Mohammed Azharuddin and was a mix of both youth and experience, having experienced veterans such as Dilip Vengsarkar, Ravi Shastri and Kapil Dev as well as upcoming stars like Sanjay Manjrekar and Sachin Tendulkar. The series is notable for Graham Gooch's triple century, legendary leg-spinner and future Indian cricket captain Anil Kumble making his international debut and Tendulkar making his 1st Test century at the age of 17, becoming the youngest Test centurion at the time.\nBackground.\nIndia were the second touring side to visit England in 1990, following New Zealand, who had lost their three-match Test series 1–0 and drawn the One Day series 1–1 during their tour. England's victory against New Zealand was their first series win at home since the 1985 Ashes and, except for a victory in a one-off match against Sri Lanka, their first home Test victory in 24 attempts. India's previous tour of England was in 1986, when they won 2–0; coming into the 1990 tour, they had not won an away Test match since. The two sides had not met since the 1986 tour.\nThe Indian team selected for the tour was different compared to the successful 1986 team. Legendary players like Sunil Gavaskar and Mohinder Amarnath had long since retired, while opener Krishnamachari Srikkanth and left-arm spinner Maninder Singh were dropped. However the team now had a young Sachin Tendulkar, who had already proved himself at the age of 17 as capable of being world-class and was now being predicted as the successor to Gavaskar. Captain Mohammed Azharuddin was now the leading batsman in the side while the 1986 tour winning captain Kapil Dev, Ravi Shastri and the hero of the 1986 tour, Dilip Vengsarkar, were slowly coming to the end of their careers.\nAftermath.\nBoth Azharuddin and Atherton were named Wisden Cricketers of the Year.\nExternal sources.\nCricketArchive – tour itineraries"

They played a total of eighteen matches, including three Tests and three One Day Internationals (ODIs) against England. In the Tests and ODIs, India were captained by Mohammad Azharuddin, while Michael Atherton captained England.\nThis tour saw Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and Venkatesh Prasad make their Test debuts. Prasad made his debut in the 1st Test at Edgbaston, taking six wickets in this match and ultimately finishing as the leading wicket-taker in the Test series with 16. Ganguly and Dravid made their debuts in the 2nd Test at Lord's, scoring 131 and 95 respectively; both would go on to become mainstays of the Indian batting as well as national captains. The team also included established players such as Azharuddin, Sachin Tendulkar, Anil Kumble, Javagal Srinath, Sanjay Manjrekar and Nayan Mongia.\nNonetheless, the tour was a disaster for India. The team lost the Test series 1–0 (with the last two matches drawn), and the ODI series 2–0 (with no result in the first match due to rain). The rest of the tour saw victories in a single-innings match against the Duke of Norfolk's XI and limited-overs matches against an England National Cricket Association XI and Middlesex, but also defeats in a limited-overs match against Northamptonshire and a first-class match against Derbyshire. The tour was also marred by a spat between Azharuddin and opener Navjot Singh Sidhu, which resulted in the latter walking out of the tour after the 2nd ODI. Following the tour, Azharuddin, who was also facing personal problems at the time, was sacked as captain."

        "text": "The India national cricket team toured England from 19 July to 8 September 2007. The tour included 3 Tests and 7 ODIs. During the Test series, the Pataudi Trophy, a prize commissioned by the MCC to commemorate the 118th anniversary of India's Test debut, was competed for. This was designed and created by Jocelyn Burton, Holborn, London.\nSquad.\nTest squads.\nSteve Harmison was named in the England squad for the first Test but withdrew just a day later due to a hernia and underwent an operation to treat it, ruling him out for the entire series. Chris Tremlett was named as his replacement. Matthew Hoggard did not play in the first two Test matches against India after being sent to hospital following a back spasm.\nWith the resignation of Greg Chappell after the Cricket World Cup 2007 and Graham Ford declining the position of Indian coach, India entered the series without a coach. Virender Sehwag and Harbhajan Singh were not named in the Indian squad due to recent poor performances while Irfan Pathan and Munaf Patel were not fully fit.\nODI squads.\nOn 7 August 2007, the BCCI Secretary Niranjan Shah named the Indian squad for the seven-match ODI series.\nThe list of players are: Rahul Dravid (captain), Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Yuvraj Singh, Ramesh Powar, Dinesh Karthik, Zaheer Khan, R. P. Singh, Munaf Patel, Robin Uthappa, Rohit Sharma, Piyush Chawla, Gautam Gambhir, Ajit Agarkar.\nPataudi Trophy (Test).\n1st Test.\nThe first Test match at Lord's saw Chris Tremlett make his England Test debut. Michael Vaughan won the toss and chose to bat first. Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook took advantage of average Indian bowling scoring 40 runs after only 5 overs putting on 76 before Sourav Ganguly made the break through dismissing Cook on 36 lbw from his fourth ball of the match. No further wickets fell in the morning session although Strauss was dropped on 43 by Dinesh Karthik at the stroke of lunch.\nMichael Vaughan and Strauss scored a 142 run second wicket partnership that would prove to be crucial in the match. Strauss was dismissed on 96 edging a slider from Anil Kumble. England in a seemingly strong position of 252/2 lost two quick wickets of Michael Vaughan and Paul Collingwood. Vaughan edged an R. P. Singh delivery straight to Dhoni while Paul Collingwood went for his first Test duck being deceived by a googly from Kumble and was trapped lbw reducing England to 255/4. This wicket meant Anil Kumble overtook Shane Warne's Test record of 138 lbw wickets. Ryan Sidebottom joined Kevin Pietersen as nightwatchman and survived 5 deliveries before the day ended with England on 268/4.\nHeavy rain in the morning and poor weather forecasts made any play on the second day a remote possibility but rain stopped at around 13:00 BST allowing play to resume at 13:50 BST. The restart saw the Indian attack dismiss England for 298 with the final 26 runs costing 6 wickets. Chris Tremlett and Monty Panesar both went for ducks while Sidebottom and Matt Prior went on 1.\nThere was controversial moment in this session when Pietersen began walking when he edged a ball to Dhoni and appeared to be out caught. He turned back however when he saw his teammates at the pavilion waving him to go back when they saw Steve Bucknor telling Simon Taufel he thought the ball had not carried. TV replays showed the ball did not carry and Pietersen was given not out by the third umpire Ian Gould. This decision did not cost India however as Pietersen did not score any runs before being caught.\nDinesh Karthik was dismissed early on lbw and India could have been 16/2 had Prior not drop Wasim Jaffer in the second over. Rahul Dravid could not make a start and was removed cutting an outswinger to Prior. Sachin Tendulkar consolidated India's innings however scoring 80 runs with Jaffer before he was dismissed on 37. India lost one further wicket of Jaffer (which was Tremlett first Test wicket) and closed the day on 145/4.\nThe day began in similar vein to the previous one with India losing their remaining 6 wickets in the space of 15 overs closing their innings on 201. James Anderson got his career best bowling figures of 5/42 in this innings. Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook negotiated the final two overs of the session before lunch was taken.\nPlay did not resume until 15:25 BST due to rain. At the restart Zaheer Khan left-handed swing troubled the opening batsmen with Strauss and Cook going out in quick succession before play stopped. After the rain interruption Vaughan and Pietersen survived the final 35 minutes of the play to end the day on 77/2 leading the game by 174 runs.\nEngland scored 25 runs before Vaughan was clean bowled by R. P. Singh. Collingwood and Bell's wickets soon followed and England were 132/5. No further wickets fell in the morning session and England went into lunch at 161/5. The afternoon session started with Prior and Pietersen putting on 90 runs at a rate of 5 an over to swing the game in England's favour before Prior was eventually caught by Dhoni. Chris Tremlett completed his pair being bowled by Khan, becoming the first Englishman since 1999 to get a pair on debut. Pietersen struggled to protect the tail and England were dismissed for 282 before tea setting India a target of 380 runs for victory. Singh got his bowling figures of 5/59 in this innings.\nIn the final session of the day, India scored runs quickly, making 137 runs at a cost of 3 wickets. India lost the key wickets of Dravid and Tendulkar both out lbw. Going into a tense final day, all results were still possible.\nIndia lost two early wickets of Sourav Ganguly (lbw) and Karthik (caught) meaning that any chance of an Indian victory disappeared. Weather forecasts had predicted rain and it became a race against time for England to win the match before rain arrived while India would have to hold out for a draw. VVS Laxman and Dhoni produced a stand of 86 runs before Laxman was bowled by Tremlett.\nThis left Dhoni with the task of rear guard which was to protect the tail from the English attack. The next 3 wickets fell within 8 overs leaving India on 263/9. With light deteriorating Vaughan and Panesar bowled the final 7 overs of the match. Sreesanth survived a strong lbw appeal from Panesar before bad light forced tea to be taken early. Rain meant that there was no evening session and the Test ended in a draw. Pietersen was awarded man of the match for his (134) century.\n2nd Test.\nIndia won the toss and chose to bowl on a pitch which was wet due to rainfall over the past few days. From then on, England were on the back foot and kept on losing wickets. India had an exceptional day with the ball. Alastair Cook scored 43 and became the youngest England batsman to cross 1500 test runs, before being dismissed lbw by Ganguly. Zaheer was the pick of the Indian Bowlers and took 3 wickets. The other Indian Bowlers responded well, too. England ended the day at 169–7 at Stumps on Day 1.\nEngland resumed at 169–7, were done for 198 at the 1st session itself and so, the useful landmark of 200 proved elusive to England. Cook was the top scorer for England with 43 and Khan was the pick of the bowlers whose spell read: 21-5-57-4. The Indians began their innings well with Jaffer and Karthik scoring half centuries and putting 147 runs for the 1st wicket before Jaffer was caught behind for 62. Wickets of Karthik(77) and Dravid(37) also fell but India moved to a safe position of 254–3 at Stumps on Day 2. Tendulkar scored his 11000th test run.\nIndia resumed at 254–3. Tendulkar, Ganguly and Laxman scored half centuries and were dismissed for 91, 79 and 54 respectively. India were eventually done for 481 with the lower order except Sreeshanth and Singh making some contributions with the bat, and England had a tough 16 overs to reckon with in this day. But this time, England Batsman showed some composure and were 43–0 at stumps on Day 3 with the openers Cook and Strauss scoring 17 and 21 respectively.\nEngland resumed at 43-0 but the breakthrough for India came in the 3rd over itself when Khan trapped Cook plumb in front for 23. Strauss scored fifty, but was dismissed by Khan due to a loose short and Singh struck with the wickets of Peterson and Prior. Vaughan carried on to score a century and his 5000th test run to keep England in the hunt. But India opted for the new ball and Khan inflicted thunder-blows by dismissing both Vaughan and Bell. Collingwood was also dismissed by Khan after he scored a fifty. England were eventually bundled up for 355 which left India with 73 runs to win the match. India ended the day with 10–0 at stumps on day 4 but the day was about Zaheer Khan, whose spell of the second innings read: 27-10-75-5.\nIndia began the day with only 63 runs left to make in order to win the match. Wasim Jaffer and Dinesh Karthik began to added 22 runs the Indian score. The Indian team soon lost the wickets of Jaffer, Karthik and Sachin. Ganguly and Dravid made 2 and 11 runs respectively confirming the Indian win. Zaheer Khan was adjudged man of the match for his 9 wickets in the match.\n3rd Test.\nIndia won the toss, and chose to bat first on a flat wicket which proved very good for batting. Both teams were unchanged again from the Trent Bridge Test, creating the rare scenario of both teams fielding the same 11 players per side for all matches of the series.\nEngland's bowlers worked hard throughout days 1 and 2, but were unable to replicate the successes they had previously achieved against India's powerful batting line up. Dinesh Karthik continued his good form to score 91, and Rahul Dravid scored 55 before he was clean bowled by a good delivery from James Anderson. England's cause was not helped by dropped catches from the wicketkeeper Matt Prior – first off Sachin Tendulkar when he was on 20, and then VVS Laxman when he was on 41. Tendulkar went on to make 82, and Laxman 51. Prior also conceded five lots of four byes on day 1, though some of these might conceivably have been signalled wide.\nIndia finished day 1 on 316/4, and accelerated their scoring significantly on day 2. Mahendra Singh Dhoni scored 92, and was only dismissed off the part-time spin of Kevin Pietersen after having hit two massive sixes and attempting a third. Then, veteran spinner Anil Kumble registered his maiden test century in his 118th match, which was a delightful moment for all followers of Indian cricket. Kumble would go unbeaten, finishing on 110 not out, and the lower order all contributed useful runs to help India compile an enormous score of 664. This total pretty much ensured that India could not lose the match, and would therefore win the series.\nEngland came out to bat late on day 2, and lost the wicket of Andrew Strauss before the close. They continued to lose wickets regularly through day 3, with the shot selection of some of the middle order batsmen being called into question. Zaheer Khan, India's bowler of the series picked up three wickets and Kumble also took three. For England, Alastair Cook, Ian Bell and Paul Collingwood all scored in the 60s, but no one went on to make a big score – leaving England on 345 all out early on day 4 and facing the prospect of following on.\nRahul Dravid chose not to enforce the follow-on, however, a decision regarded as negative by many. However, there were concerns about Zaheer Khan who may have strained his thigh, and both India and Australia have been reluctant to enforce the follow-on since the incredible match in Kolkata in 2001 where India won the match having been forced to follow-on by Australia.\nFor a short period, Dravid's decision looked to be potentially dangerous as England captured three very early wickets to leave India on 11/3, with an overall lead of 330. Dravid himself then batted in a very defensive manner, in an innings where he scored 12 from 96 deliveries. At one point, he had only scored 2 from 52 balls. However, Sourav Ganguly batted aggressively at the other end, and Laxman and Dhoni also contributed to boost India's score, and allow Dravid to declare leaving England exactly 500 to win in 110 overs.\nEngland survived until the end of day 4 without loss. For the most part, they batted sensibly throughout day 5 to reach 369/6 by the close of play and secure themselves a draw. However, there were still questions about the technique of some of the batsmen, with Michael Vaughan, Kevin Pietersen and Ian Bell all falling to slightly injudicious shots. Pietersen scored another test century, which was the main contributor to ensuring the draw by the close of play. Kumble was awarded man of the match.\nIndia had won the series 1–0, and secured their first series victory in England since 1986. Overall, the series had been a very good one, with two evenly matched sides competing well. England were unlucky not to win the first test at Lords due to rain, although they had had their chances. India seized on the opportunities they created at Trent Bridge to take the lead, and then first and foremost batted England out of contention in the final test, before thinking about winning it, which they did very effectively.\nNatWest Series (ODI).\n1st ODI.\nAlastair Cook and Ian Bell both posted maiden ODI centuries, and James Anderson took three early wickets in India's chase to leave them on 34/4, and ensuring that the target of 289 was well out of their reach.\n4th ODI.\nIndia's decision to bat first seemed to be a mistake after they were left 32/3 but Sachin Tendulkar's half century and small contributions later pushed India to 212.\nThis seemingly was enough for the touring side as England crashed to 0/1 and soon 35/3. By the time captain Paul Collingwood was run out, England needed 99 runs to win with all-rounder Ravi Bopara and bowler Stuart Broad to fend off the remaining 26 overs. Surprisingly the two put a record eight wicket partnership for England, the hosts taking the series 3–1 with a three-wicket victory and Broad picking up man of the match for his 45 not out and 4/51.\nNotes and references.\n "

        "title": "New Zealand cricket team in England in 1927",
        "text": "The New Zealand cricket team toured England in the 1927 season. The team contained many of the players who would later play Test cricket for New Zealand, but the tour did not include any Test matches and the 1927 English cricket season was the last, apart from the Second World War years and the cancelled South African tour of 1970, in which there was no Test cricket in England.\nBackground.\nIn 1926, the Imperial Cricket Conference, forerunner of the International Cricket Council, allowed for the first time delegates from India, New Zealand and the West Indies to attend. The three were invited to organise themselves into cricket boards that could, in future, select representative teams to take part in Test matches, which had hitherto been restricted to sides from England, Australia and South Africa.\nA non-Test playing visit from a side from New Zealand had already been arranged for the 1927 season, paid for by a private finance deal involving the sale of £1 shares, and it was agreed that this tour should go ahead without Test matches before a decision was taken on whether New Zealand was ready for Test cricket. In the event, the 1927 side did well enough to get an official (though scarcely full-strength) MCC tour agreed for 1929–30, in which the first New Zealand Tests were played. And future New Zealand tours of England, from 1931 onwards, were full Test match tours.\nNew Zealand squad.\nThe team was captained by Tom Lowry, who had played first-class cricket in England for Somerset and Cambridge University. In all, 17 players were used, but three of them only played once, and 10 cricketers played in 20 or more of the 26 first-class matches.\nThe 14 players who made up the regular side were:\nThe three who played just one game each were:\nJames was originally selected as second wicketkeeper, but made such a strong impression that he played in almost every match; only in some minor matches did Lowry deputise for James as wicketkeeper. Of the 14 regulars, only Bernau, Cunningham, Dacre and Oliver did not go on to play Test cricket; of the irregulars, Blundell came closest to Test cricket, representing New Zealand against MCC on an unofficial tour in 1935–36.\nFirst-class matches.\nMatches were played against 16 of the 17 first-class counties, with five won and four lost. The touring side was particularly strong in batting, and most of their victories relied on the weight of runs produced. The exception was the match against Somerset at Weston-super-Mare where the New Zealanders, after being dismissed for 128 in the second innings, their lowest total of the tour, won by 94 runs with Allcott taking five wickets for three runs in a feeble display by the county. The match was Arthur Wellard's first first-class appearance.\nPerhaps the most exciting game was the drawn match with Surrey at The Oval. In three days 1,345 runs were scored. New Zealand made 313, with 103 for Mills, and Surrey responded with 377, Jack Hobbs scoring 146. New Zealand then made a rapid 371, with Dempster making 101 and McGirr 66, and Merritt reduced Surrey to 207 for 8, taking five wickets. But an unbroken ninth wicket partnership of 77 took Surrey to within 24 of victory before the match ended.\nEven that total of runs was surpassed in the match against an all-amateur MCC side, which yielded 1,522 runs in three May days, but ended as a draw. Other first-class matches included the usual touring side games with the universities and end-of-season festival cricket. But there were also first-class matches against the Royal Navy, the Army, the Civil Service and Wales. In all 26 matches, New Zealand won seven and lost five, with the others drawn, including several affected by weather.\nOther matches.\nThe New Zealanders played 12 other matches, mostly of two-days duration, winning six of them and drawing the others. These included four games in a week in Scotland and five against Minor Counties.\nLeading players.\nWisden Cricketers' Almanack for 1928, reporting on the tour, singled out the batting for special praise. \"With scarcely an exception they played an enterprising game and in most instances made their runs in a style which told of intelligent coaching,\" it said. Six batsmen scored more than 1,000 runs in first-class matches. The tourists' averages were led by Dempster, with 1,430 runs at 44.68 runs per innings; by aggregate, Blunt did better, with 1,540 at exactly 44 runs an innings. Lowry, Mills, Page and Dacre also passed 1,000 runs in first-class games. In all matches, Dempster and Blunt scored more than 2,000 runs each.\nThe bowling was less successful. Merritt, aged 19, took 107 first-class wickets with leg-breaks and googlies, and Blunt, of similar style, took 78. But no other bowler took 50 and the fast bowler Cunningham failed completely, taking just five first-class wickets on the tour as a whole. In all matches, Merritt took 169 wickets. Blunt's all-round performance earned him selection as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in the 1928 annual.\nJames, with 42 catches and 43 stumpings in the first-class matches, was also singled out for praise by Wisden. The rest of the fielding, it said, fell below normal first-class standards.\nVerdict and aftermath.\nMCC reported in 1928 that the tour had been a success and the following year that an MCC side would visit New Zealand in the 1929–30 season. As MCC also accepted an invitation to tour West Indies the same winter, and as several leading players excused themselves from both tours, the side that went to New Zealand was not especially strong. The representative matches played, though, were designated as New Zealand's first Test matches.\nLargely owing to the persistently poor weather, the tour was not a financial success. The Coates government, with the support of the Opposition, contributed ₤1,000 to help defray the costs. In order to make up some of the remaining losses, the New Zealand Cricket Council organised two matches in Wellington and Christchurch in November 1927 between the touring team and a Rest of New Zealand team. The touring team had the better of a rain-ruined match in Wellington, and won the match in Christchurch by an innings.\nCeylon and Australia.\nThe New Zealanders had a stopover in Colombo during their voyage home and another in Sydney. On 8 October, they played a one-day single-innings match against the Ceylon national team, which at that time did not have Test status. From 28 to 31 October, they played a first-class match against New South Wales and lost by 10 wickets."

        "title": "New Zealand cricket team in England in 1931",
        "text": "The New Zealand cricket team toured England in the 1931 season. The tour was the first tour by a New Zealand team in which Test matches were arranged. Originally, only one Test was planned, but New Zealand acquitted themselves so well in the first match and in the game against MCC that matches against Surrey and Lancashire were hastily replaced by two further Test matches. Of the three Tests played, the first was drawn, the second was won comfortably by England; the third was heavily affected by rain and also drawn. The tour as a whole was blighted by poor weather, and 23 of the 32 first-class matches ended as draws.\nBackground.\nIn 1926, the Imperial Cricket Conference, forerunner of the International Cricket Council, allowed for the first time delegates from India, New Zealand and the West Indies to attend. The three were invited to organise themselves into cricket boards that could, in future, select representative teams to take part in Test matches, which had hitherto been restricted to sides from England, Australia and South Africa.\nA non-Test playing visit from a side from New Zealand had already been arranged for the 1927 season, and this tour went ahead without Test matches before a decision was taken on whether New Zealand was ready for Test cricket. In the event, the 1927 side did well enough to get an official (though scarcely full-strength) MCC tour agreed for 1929-30, in which New Zealand's first-ever Tests were played. And future New Zealand tours of England, from this 1931 tour onwards, were full Test match tours.\nThe 1931 New Zealand team.\nAs in 1927, the team was captained by Tom Lowry, the former Cambridge University and Somerset batsman. Lowry also acted as the tour manager for much of the season until A. T. Donnelly, the chairman of the New Zealand Cricket Council, arrived for the second half of the tour. According to Wisden's 1932 edition, Allcott looked after the tour finances.\nThe touring side's players were:\nOf the 14 players, 13 appeared in at least one Test match on the tour, the exception being Talbot, who never played Test cricket. Lowry, Allcott, Blunt, Dempster, James, Merritt, Mills and Page had been members of the 1927 touring team.\nThe Test matches.\nA single Test match, at Lord's at the end of June, was scheduled. But the touring team did so well in this match and in the earlier showpiece match with MCC that county matches against Surrey and Lancashire later in the summer were replaced by further Tests.\nFirst Test Match, Lord's, 27–30 June 1931.\nDempster made 53 and New Zealand were 132 for two at lunch on the first day, but the innings subsided against the spin of Ian Peebles (five for 77) and Walter Robins. Cromb and Merritt then reduced England to 190 for seven at the end of the first day, and Frank Woolley had made 80 of those. On the Monday, an eighth wicket partnership of 246 between Leslie Ames (137) and Gubby Allen (122) – still the record England eighth wicket partnership – took England to a lead of 230. Dempster, with 120, Page (104) and Blunt (96) all scored well in New Zealand's reply, and a late partnership by Lowry and Allcott enabled the tourists to declare, setting England 240 to win in 140 minutes.\nSecond Test Match, The Oval, 29–31 July 1931.\nCenturies by Herbert Sutcliffe, Duleepsinhji and Wally Hammond led England to a big total, and New Zealand, lacking Dempster, who was injured, wilted against Gubby Allen, who took five for 14 in 13 overs. Only Lowry, with 62, made runs and Maurice Tate, though taking only one wicket, bowled 18 overs for just 15 runs. Following on, New Zealand's batsmen struggled again, with only Vivian (51), Blunt (43), Mills (30) and Kerr (28) getting a start. The match, which had lost some time to rain, was over in the mid-afternoon of the third day.\nThird Test Match, Manchester, 15–18 August 1931.\nRain ruined the match, and a start could not be made until midway through the last afternoon. Sutcliffe, with an unbeaten 109, scored his second century of the series.\nFirst-class and other matches.\nA total of 32 first-class matches, including the three Tests, were played, but only nine of them came to a definite result in a very wet summer. The New Zealanders won the matches against Essex, MCC, Northamptonshire, Scotland, Glamorgan and Gloucestershire. Apart from their Test defeat, they also lost to Middlesex and Kent.\nThe first two victories were perhaps the best performances of the season. In the very first match of the tour, Dempster hit 212 as New Zealand made 425 against Essex, and Merritt took 12 wickets for 130 runs (including eight for 41 in the second innings) as the tourists won by an innings and 48 runs. Three matches later, a strong MCC side with 10 amateurs was beaten by an innings and 122 runs: New Zealand made 302 for nine declared in an innings that, because of rain, took up the first two days. Then MCC were dismissed for 132, with Cromb taking six for 46, and then for just 48, with Merritt taking seven for 28.\nLeading players.\nAs in 1927, New Zealand's batting proved rather stronger than the bowling, and Dempster, with 1,778 runs at an average of 59.26 runs per innings, finished fifth in the overall season's averages and top of the tourists' averages. As in 1927, Blunt finished second to Dempster, and his record of 1,592 runs at 43.02 was very similar to his own record in 1927 and also included the highest individual score of the tour, an unbeaten 225 against the Gentlemen of England at Eastbourne. Four other players, Mills, Lowry, Vivian and Weir, passed 1,000 runs for the season in first-class matches, and Page reached 990. Every player except Allcott (who had scored two centuries in 1927) averaged 16 or more runs per innings.\nThe bowling was less successful, and though Merritt was again the leading wicket-taker, his 99 wickets cost 26.48 runs each. Vivian, with 64 first-class wickets to go alongside 1,002 runs, was the leading all-rounder, but Blunt's leg-spin was less effective, and his 34 wickets cost more than 34 runs apiece.\nWisden reported that the fielding, which had been a weak point on the 1927 tour, was much improved, and as it had done after the 1927 tour it singled out the wicketkeeping of James for particular praise.\nVerdict and aftermath.\nWisden reported that the touring team approached the season realistically, not expecting to win many matches but seeking to learn from the experience. The almanack took the view that it had been a mistake to expand the Test match programme to three matches after the success against MCC and the draw in the Lord's Test, but noted that the finances had suffered because of the wet summer, and that this may have influenced the decision.\nIn the winter following the 1931 tour of England, New Zealand played their first Test matches against a side other than England, with the visit to New Zealand of a South African side fresh from a heavy defeat in Australia. Eight of the 1931 side played in these matches, but Lowry had retired from Test cricket and the team was captained by Page. Both matches were lost, largely due to second innings batting failures."

        "text": "The New Zealand cricket team toured England in the 1937 season. The team was the third from New Zealand to tour England, following those of 1927 and 1931, and the second to play Test matches. Three Tests were arranged: England won the second match at Manchester, and the games at Lord's and The Oval were drawn, the latter affected by rain. On the tour as a whole, the New Zealanders played 32 first-class matches, winning nine and losing nine, with 14 ending as draws.\nBackground.\nAfter a flurry of activity from 1929–30 to 1932–33, in which New Zealand played its first 11 Test matches – nine against England, two against South Africa – more than four years passed with no Test cricket. The 1936-37 MCC team to Australia did not play Tests on its brief visit to New Zealand, unlike the 1932-33 side.\nThat 1936–37 series in Australia had proved a fairly chastening experience for England, who won the first two Tests but lost the final three, and so failed to regain The Ashes. The England selectors used the 1937 Test series against New Zealand as an opportunity to try out new players: Len Hutton and Denis Compton were among those who made their Test debuts in the series.\nThe 1937 New Zealand team.\nThe 1937 side was captained by Curly Page, who was the sole remaining player from the team that toured England in 1927. The manager was Tom Lowry, captain of both the 1927 and 1931 sides, and he played in several matches, largely acting as deputy wicketkeeper, a role he had taken on both the previous tours, though he also scored a century against Nottinghamshire.\nThe full side was:\nPage, Vivian, Kerr and Weir were the only survivors from the 1931 tour; Hadlee, Wallace, Cowie and Donnelly were members of the next touring party to England, in 1949. Of the 15 regular players (without Lowry), 13 played in the Tests. The exceptions were Carson and Lamason, neither of whom played Test cricket. Page, Carson and Tindill are credited as three of only seven \"double All Blacks\", playing both cricket and rugby for New Zealand's national sides. Of the seven, Tindill is the only one to have played Tests in both sports, Page played only cricket Tests, and Carson played Tests in neither.\nTest series.\nThree Test matches were played, and England won the only match of the series to come to a definite result.\n1st Test.\nEngland's debutant openers, Len Hutton and Jim Parks senior, did not last long, but Joe Hardstaff junior and Wally Hammond then hit centuries and shared a third wicket partnership of 245. But only Eddie Paynter of the other batsmen made runs. New Zealand lost wickets regularly, with Kerr and Hadlee making 30s and Wallace reaching 52. But at 176 for seven wickets, the follow-on looked likely. Then an eighth wicket partnership of 104 between Moloney, who made 64 and Roberts, unbeaten on 66, came to the rescue. The new openers failed again in England's second innings, but Hardstaff made 64 and Charles Barnett an undefeated 83 to set up the declaration. Resolute batting by Wallace, with 56, and Kerr, who was injured and came in at No 7, saved the match for New Zealand.\n2nd Test.\nHutton made his maiden Test century in his second Test, and shared an opening partnership of 100 with Barnett, who made 62, and a second wicket partnership of 128 with Hardstaff, who made 58. England were 296 for three, but rash batting against Cowie and Gallichan led to six wickets falling for a further 62 runs before close of play. England declared overnight, and New Zealand, despite 58 from Vivian, were reduced to 119 for five before Hadlee, scoring 93, put on 99 with Page. England lost three wickets before close of play and had been reduced to 75 for seven on the final morning, just 152 ahead, mainly through fine seam bowling by Cowie. Freddie Brown, though, cajoled the tail into a further 112 runs. Cowie finished with match figures on 10 for 140. New Zealand's second innings, chasing 265, started well, and Vivian and Moloney put on 50 for the first wicket before Moloney was run out. Vivian went on to his second 50 of the match, but only Donnelly of the other batsmen reached double figures, and Tom Goddard, achieving a lot of turn with his off-breaks, took six for 29 to win the match.\n3rd Test.\nOnly half an hour's play was possible on the first day because of rain. New Zealand struggled to 47 for four before 50s from Donnelly, Page and Roberts rescued them. England in turn lost three quick wickets, but Denis Compton, aged 19 and in his first Test, made 65 and Hardstaff 103. The declaration came at lunchtime on the final day and a result appeared possible when New Zealand, despite 57 out of 87 from Vivian, lost wickets regularly across the afternoon. But a late rally by Moloney and Tindill took the match out of England's reach, and the game petered out to a draw.\nFirst-class and other matches.\nIncluding the Test matches, 32 first-class games were played; nine were won, nine lost and 14 drawn.\nIn a damp start to the tour, Cambridge University were beaten in a low-scoring match, but there were defeats by Glamorgan, Lancashire (twice), Derbyshire and Worcestershire before the first Test, and no further victories in first-class matches.\nAfter the Lord's Test, the New Zealanders won a high-scoring game against Somerset and beat Scotland. Form into August was patchy: a big score (495) and victory against Surrey at the end of July was followed by a heavy second defeat by Glamorgan. Essex were beaten just before the final Test and the Combined Services team in two days just afterwards. The English part of the tour ended with wins over Sussex and the Minor Counties, but defeats by Kent and H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's XI.\nThere was a remarkable codicil. The New Zealand team left Scarborough and arrived in Dublin next day for a three-day match against Ireland. But the match was over in a single day. Ireland made 79, with only four players reaching double figures; New Zealand's reply was worse, as only two players reached double figures in a total of 64. Then Cowie took six wickets for three runs in eight overs as Ireland made just 30 – 15 of those were scored by one batsman, 10 were byes and eight batsmen failed to score. New Zealand hit off the 46 runs for victory by eight wickets.\nLeading players.\nIn a season when the weather was kinder than it often is in England, New Zealand's cricketers emerged with a record similar to that of the earlier tours in 1927 and 1931, with a pretty even balance of wins and losses, except that more matches came to a definite conclusion.\nOn the batting side, there were perhaps fewer stars than on the earlier tours, with Roger Blunt retired and Stewie Dempster captaining Leicestershire. In bowling too, Bill Merritt, the leading wicket-taker of the two previous visits, was now playing in the Lancashire League, and would then qualify for Northamptonshire, where the star wicketkeeper of 1927 and 1931, Ken James, was already ensconced in the side.\nBut the tour made the reputations of some younger players. Wallace and Donnelly were seen as the top youngsters, and they finished top of the first-class tour averages, though they did less well in the Tests. The most successful Test batsman was, surprisingly, Roberts, picked mainly for his bowling, and his average of 47.33 was surpassed on the England side by both Hardstaff and Hammond. Hadlee's 93 was the highest Test score, and Vivian's the highest Test aggregate at 194 runs in six innings.\nIn bowling, one player stood out. Cowie took 19 of the 40 Test wickets, and no other player on either side got into double figures – partly, perhaps, because England varied their bowling attack for each Test.\nIn the first-class season as a whole, Cowie again was what \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" called \"the outstanding player of the team\". He took 114 wickets at less than 20 runs apiece. Dunning, with off-breaks, took 83 first-class wickets but they cost more than 30 runs each and he took only three Test wickets.\nSix batsmen – Wallace, Donnelly, Moloney, Kerr, Hadlee and Vivian – passed 1,000 runs for the season, with Wallace's 1,641 at an average of 41.02 the best both in aggregate and average. Kerr's 160 against the Minor Counties was the highest score for the team. Tindill was an efficient wicketkeeper and the fielding as a whole was enthusiastic.\nVerdict and aftermath.\nThe 1937 New Zealand tour was rated a disappointment by \"Wisden\", which said the team had not fulfilled expectations. In mitigation, it added that a long, latterly dry but relatively cheerless summer had made the tour particularly arduous, and there had been little time for preparation.\nIn the event, for all except five of the team, the 1937 marked the end of their Test cricket, and for New Zealand there were no more Tests until the end of the Second World War. Then in consecutive domestic New Zealand seasons, there were single matches against first Australia in 1945-46 and then England in 1946-47, and in both matches Hadlee, Wallace, Tindill and Cowie played. Donnelly, another who went into English cricket with Oxford University and Warwickshire, re-emerged to rejoin the 1949 touring team, which was the next New Zealand side to visit England."

Leveson-Gower's XI at Scarborough, was counted as first-class and the team played three times at Lord's. Several of the one- and two-day matches were written up in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack for 1946. In February 2017, a retrospective account of all known tour games was recorded in the book \"Overshadowed: The New Zealand Services Cricket Team in England 1945\" by Rob Franks.\nThe side was captained by Ken James, who had toured England as a wicketkeeper with the 1927 and 1931 New Zealand teams, and played for Northamptonshire in the late 1930s as a professional. Other former and future Test players in the team at different times included Stewie Dempster, Ted Badcock, Martin Donnelly, Roger Blunt and Alex Moir. Tom Pritchard, who played county cricket for Warwickshire for several seasons from 1946, was also a member of the New Zealand Services side.\nIn addition to the former Test cricketers living in England during wartime, a range of players were called upon to join the team, including airmen from RNZAF; sailors from RNZN; ex-POWs and army servicemen based in England during the summer of 1945. Over 20 (former or future) first-class cricketers represented the New Zealand Services team.\nFirst-class match.\nThe one first-class match against Leveson-Gower's XI was lost by eight wickets. Donnelly scored 100 in the first innings and 86 in the second, and Badcock took six for 166 against a side that included several England Test players. But Len Hutton scored 188 and though the New Zealanders declared their second innings with the game apparently saved, Leveson-Gower's XI hit 63 in 25 minutes to win.\nSources.\nRob Franks, \"Overshadowed: The New Zealand Services Cricket Team in England 1945\", 2017"

        "title": "New Zealand cricket team in England in 1949",
        "text": "The New Zealand cricket team toured England in the 1949 season. The team was the fourth official touring side from New Zealand, following those in 1927, 1931 and 1937, and was by some distance the most successful to this date. The four-match Test series with England was shared, every game ending as a draw, and of 35 first-class fixtures, 14 were won, 20 drawn and only one lost.\nBackground.\nNew Zealand had had very limited Test cricket in recent years. The last full tour of England had been in 1937, and since the Second World War there had been only two single matches, one against Australia in 1945-46 and the other the following season against the touring MCC team led by Wally Hammond. Consequently, many of the New Zealand players were untested at the highest level of the game.\nBy contrast, England had played full series both at home and abroad in every summer and winter since the end of the war, though with mixed results. The team had been comprehensively outplayed twice by Australia, and though other results against India, South Africa and West Indies had been better, there had been considerable experimentation with new players, and only a handful of players could consider themselves certainties for selection were England to choose to field its strongest side.\nThe New Zealand team.\nThe side consisted of 15 players and was led by Walter Hadlee, who was one of four players – the others were Merv Wallace, Martin Donnelly and Jack Cowie – who had toured with the 1937 team.\nThe side was:\nJack Phillipps, the tour manager, played in one minor match against Durham (not then first-class). Reid, a lively fast bowler as well as a batsman, was used as the second wicketkeeper and had to deputise in the fourth Test for Mooney, who was unfit. Of the 15 players, 13 appeared in the Test matches. The exceptions were Burke, who had played his only Test match in the game against Australia in 1945–46, and Hayes, who was injured for much of this tour but became a regular player for New Zealand across much of the 1950s, touring England again in 1958. Cave, Reid and Sutcliffe also toured with the 1958 side.\nTest series.\nThe four Test matches were allocated only three days each. After the first two matches ended in draws, the New Zealanders were asked if they would add an extra day to each of the last two matches. After consulting with their domestic cricket board, the tourists turned the idea down, arguing that this would have disrupted their commitments to county matches.\n1st Test.\nNew Zealand, with only four front-line bowlers, were able to contain England's batsmen but struggled to dismiss them. Centuries by Len Hutton and Denis Compton ensured a large score, but England made only 307 runs on the first day, Cowie taking five wickets, and Burtt mopped up the tail on the Monday morning to claim five also. Trevor Bailey, in his first Test, troubled the early batsmen with his pace, and the fourth wicket was down at 80. But Donnelly and Smith put on 120 and Smith went on to score 96. A last-wicket partnership between Mooney and Cowie put on 57 and went into the last morning, but Cowie was injured and could not bowl in England's second innings. Fast scoring by Bill Edrich and George Mann, and less fast by an injured Cyril Washbrook, who scored 103, led to a declaration. But 299 to win in 150 minutes was too much to ask and Sutcliffe, Scott and Smith got batting practice as the game petered out.\n2nd Test.\nEngland lost five wickets for 112, but the pitch got easier and Compton (116) and Bailey (93) put on 189 for the sixth wicket. England's declaration, with 20 minutes of the first day's play still to go, was technically incorrect, but New Zealand did not object. New Zealand opened with 89 from Sutcliffe and Scott, and then Donnelly, making 206 out of 347, the highest score for New Zealand at this point, took the game out of England's reach. Hutton and Jack Robertson opened with a stand of 143 to almost clear the arrears, and Robertson went on to score 121.\n3rd Test.\nNew England captain Freddie Brown put New Zealand in to bat, and Bailey took early wickets in humid conditions. There was also a debut wicket for 18-year-old Brian Close. But Donnelly, with 75, and Reid (50) added 116, and the innings went into the second day. Bailey finished with six for 84. England found it difficult to force the pace against tight bowling and fielding. All the top seven batsmen made runs, with Hutton making 73 and Edrich 78, and Reg Simpson took advantage of a tiring attack to score his first Test century, with 103. Bailey was 72 not out when Brown declared. At 109 for three, New Zealand were vulnerable, but 101 from Sutcliffe and 80 from Donnelly saw them save the match comfortably.\n4th Test.\nNew Zealand, without Mooney, for whom Reid deputised as wicketkeeper, and with Rabone unable to bowl, won the toss for the first time in the series and batted. Sutcliffe and Scott put on 121 for the first wicket, and Wallace passed 50 as well, but the later batsmen were more defensive. The innings lasted into the second day, and then Hutton and Simpson put on 147, and Hutton and Edrich followed up with a second wicket stand of 218 before Hutton was out for 206. Edrich went on to exactly 100, but from 365 for one the innings subsided. Cresswell took six for 168 with inswingers and leg cutters. Though Sutcliffe made 54, four New Zealand wickets went before the arrears were cleared, but Reid, who made 93, and Wallace, with his second 50 of the match, stood firm and the match was saved.\nFirst-class matches.\nIn 32 first-class matches, the New Zealand tourists won 13 times and lost only once, when they were caught on a drying pitch at Oxford without Cowie, their player best able to exploit such conditions. The team's success was built on the weight of runs that its batsmen provided, and the bowling figures, Burtt apart, were modest.\nAfter a draw against Yorkshire in which both Wallace and Len Hutton scored centuries, New Zealand reeled off victories against Worcestershire and Surrey, and Wallace made it four centuries in five matches in the drawn match with Leicestershire and the victory over Cambridge University.\nThe MCC match, one of the set-pieces of the cricket calendar, saw a slow draw with New Zealand rescued by a seventh wicket partnership of 176 by Mooney and Rabone. Then came the defeat by Oxford University in a low-scoring match, but the threat of a repeat in the following fixture, against Sussex, when New Zealand trailed by 116 on the first innings, disappeared through good bowling by Cowie and good batting by Reid, Sutcliffe and Donnelly in a successful run-chase. Drawn matches with Somerset and Glamorgan led up to the first Test.\nWeakness in bowling showed in the two first-class matches between the first two Tests. In the first game, Hampshire were dismissed for 129 and then centuries for Scott and Donnelly gave the New Zealanders a first innings lead of 301 before a declaration with only five wickets down. But Hampshire recovered to set the tourists 109 to win in just 35 minutes, a target that was achieved with five minutes to spare. Against Surrey, a New Zealand first innings of 465, of which Sutcliffe made 187, the county replied with 645 for nine declared, and Jack Parker scored 255.\nThe second Test was followed by an easy victory over the Combined Services, and then came 11 wickets for Burtt in the victory over Gloucestershire, a match in which the county's spin bowling pair of Tom Goddard and Sam Cook bowled unchanged through the 90 overs of the New Zealand first innings. Lancashire made the touring team follow on for the first time in the season, but New Zealand salvaged a draw, and then the match with Derbyshire followed the Hampshire pattern, with a big first-innings lead whittled down by a second-innings recovery for the county, leaving the tourists with a successful run-chase to win. Northamptonshire eked a draw out of a high-scoring match, but New Zealand dominated the game in Glasgow against Scotland and Cowie's six second-innings wickets were clean bowled.\nAfter the third Test, the return match with Yorkshire was very tight, with the county left to score 169 in 100 minutes and hanging on 61 short with the last available batsmen together when time ran out. The second match with Glamorgan was badly affected by rain with the New Zealanders in a commanding position, thanks to a big century by Wallace and six wickets for Cresswell. Games with Warwickshire, Nottinghamshire and Essex all ended in batsman-dominated draws. In the Essex game, Sutcliffe scored 243 in the first innings and an unbeaten 100 in the second innings, the first time a New Zealander had scored two hundreds in a match outside New Zealand.\nThe final Test was followed by a two-day match with Durham, and then the New Zealanders won the return match with Lancashire by scoring 153 to win in 75 minutes. Kent scraped a draw after Hadlee did not enforce the follow-on, and joint county champions Middlesex batted very unevenly, and lost by nine wickets as Sutcliffe scored 110 out of 157 in 95 minutes. The end-of-season festival matches saw a South of England side beaten by an innings and at Scarborough a H. D. G. Leveson Gower's XI side composed entirely of Test players lost by six wickets, though the New Zealanders were helped by generous declarations.\nLeading players.\nThe batsmen were the big successes of the New Zealand side and Donnelly and Sutcliffe finished fifth and eighth in the English first-class averages for the season. In first-class matches, Donnelly scored 2287 runs at an average of 61.81 and Sutcliffe scored 2627 runs at 59.70. Sutcliffe led by seven to five in centuries, and Scott and Wallace also scored five centuries each. Six other batsmen apart from the leading pair passed 1,000 runs for the season, and Wallace, Reid and Scott all averaged more than 40. In the Tests, Smith, who played in only two matches, headed the averages, but again the aggregates were dominated by Donnelly and Sutcliffe, each scoring more than 400 runs when no other batsman managed 200.\nThe bowling was less successful. In a hot and dry summer, Burtt bowled almost twice as many overs as anyone else on the touring side, and took 128 wickets at an average of 22.88. No other bowler managed more than the 62 of Cresswell, though Wisden reckoned Cowie, whose 59 wickets cost 27 runs each, was the only really menacing bowler in the side. Burtt and Cowie were the only successes at Test level, and in both cases their average runs per wicket was over 30.\nVerdict and aftermath.\nThe tour was counted as a success, and the New Zealanders won praise for their batting. The side scored more runs in first-class matches than Donald Bradman's 1948 Australian tourists, the so-called Invincibles. The power of the batting left the England cricket team no nearer finding a settled line-up for its bowlers, and the big bonus from England's perspective was the emergence of Trevor Bailey as a genuine Test-class all-rounder.\nNew Zealand's lack of international fixtures before the 1949 series was not repeated and the nucleus of the side remained in place for matches through to 1952 against West Indies and South Africa, as well as for the MCC visit in 1950–51. But Cowie retired after the 1949 series and a thin bowling attack was rendered even thinner by his departure.\nOne consequence of the domination of bat over ball in the 1949 series was that, from 1950 onwards, Test matches in England were lengthened to five days against all opponents."

        "text": "The New Zealand cricket team toured England in the 1958 season. In a notably wet summer when the touring side lost the equivalent of 29 full days of cricket, the side lost four of the five Test matches (and would probably have lost the other had rain not ruined the match). In first-class matches, they won six of their first nine games, but then won only one more all season, although they only lost two matches outside the Tests, both of them to Surrey.\nThe background.\nNew Zealand's first tour of England for nine years saw what was probably the weakest of the Test-playing nations taking on the side that could probably claim to be the strongest. In home series England had successively beaten Australia and the West Indies, and a combination of fast bowling from Brian Statham, Fred Trueman and others, spin bowling from Jim Laker and Tony Lock, and apparently reliable batting led by captain Peter May, Colin Cowdrey and Tom Graveney had made them a formidable side.\nBy contrast, New Zealand had undoubted batting class in Bert Sutcliffe, a determined captain in all-rounder John Reid, and some relatively unknown and untried players alongside a few reliable stalwarts who had played across the 1950s. The preceding years had seen New Zealand finally achieve its first-ever Test victory, and previous New Zealand sides in England had often raised their game in the big matches (though even Tests in the previous tours had been restricted to just three or four days).\nThe New Zealand touring team.\nThe side was captained by John Reid who, with Bert Sutcliffe, Harry Cave and John Hayes, were the four players who remained from the successful 1949 New Zealand team. Jack Phillipps was also returning for a second visit to England as tour manager.\nThe full side was:\nOf the 16 players, 11 had previously played Test cricket: the five newcomers were D'Arcy, Meale, Playle, Sparling and Ward, and of these five, all except Ward played in the Tests during this tour.\nThe tour.\nThe New Zealand top order was poor, D'Arcy, Playle, Harford and Miller scoring only 325 runs between them in the Tests at an average of 9.28; of the four only Playle played Test cricket again. In the Second Test at Lord's, despite scoring only 269 in the first innings, England won by an innings and 148 runs. In the Third Test at Leeds, England declared its first innings at 267 for 2, and won by an innings and 71 runs. The English spinner Tony Lock finished the series with 34 wickets at an average of 7.47.\nThe all-rounder Tony MacGibbon was New Zealand's highest scorer in the series, but he scored only 175 runs at an average of 19.44; he was also the highest wicket-taker with 20 at 19.45, nobody else taking more than six. In the first three Tests, the highest individual New Zealand innings was 39, by MacGibbon, with D'Arcy's 33 the only other score above 26. In the last two Tests, MacGibbon, Sparling and Reid each hit a fifty.\nOutside the Tests, Reid hit three first-class centuries, 1282 runs and averaged 47.48, as well as bowling and catching effectively. Wisden chose him as one of its Cricketers of the Year, noting among other things that he \"led the side cheerfully\"."

        "text": "The New Zealand cricket team toured England in the 1965 season, playing three Test matches in the first half of a damp summer. England later hosted a second three-match series against South Africa, the first time two Test series were played in a single English cricket season since the 1912 Triangular Tournament.\nThe New Zealand side lost all three Test matches, and lost three other first-class matches against English counties. The team's only victories came in one county match and in the first-class matches against Scotland and Ireland.\nBackground.\nNew Zealand had last toured England in 1958 and the 1965 tour had been scheduled for several seasons. However, the success and popularity of the 1963 West Indies tourists led to demands for an early return visit, so schedules were rearranged and New Zealand and South Africa \"doubled up\" in 1965, the first time this arrangement, now commonplace, had happened.\nSince the last tour of England, there had been five Tests between the two sides in New Zealand, England winning four of them. New Zealand had yet to record a single victory over England after 31 Tests between the teams, England having won 14 matches before this series.\nThe New Zealand team arrived in England at the end of the most intensive period of Test cricket in the country's history. The side had played three drawn matches at home to Pakistan in January and February 1965, then travelled to India for a four-match Test series which they lost 1-0 with three drawn, and then went to Pakistan for three further Tests, two of which were lost.\nThe New Zealand team was in a state of transition, with older players such as John Reid and Bert Sutcliffe, who had both first come to England with the 1949 New Zealand side, nearing retirement. At the other end of the scale were several promising batsmen, including Bev Congdon and Barry Sinclair, and young seam bowlers in Richard Collinge and Bruce Taylor. Collinge and Vic Pollard, the Lancashire-born off-spinner, were only 19 at the time of the tour.\nEngland too were in transition, with no obvious fast-bowling candidates coming through to replace veterans Brian Statham and Fred Trueman; and batsmen such as Peter May and Ted Dexter either retired or nearing the ends of their careers.\nThe New Zealand team.\nA party of 15 players left New Zealand for the six-months world tour, but that number had increased to 16 by the time the team reached England. John Ward, selected as the only wicketkeeper in the original party – though captain John Reid had kept wicket in a Test match in 1949 – was injured in India and Artie Dick was sent out as a reinforcement. Ward remained with the touring side and played in one Test in England.\nThe full team was:\nBy the time the team reached England, all of them had had experience of Test cricket, with Jarvis, Pollard, Taylor and Vivian making their Test debuts in the matches in India and Pakistan. In England, Jarvis and Vivian were the only players not to play in a Test match.\nReid and Sutcliffe were members of the 1949 tour and Reid had captained the 1958 touring team, of which Sutcliffe and Ward were also members. None of the other members of the team had previously toured England. The team was managed by Walter Hadlee, who had captained the 1949 New Zealand team in England.\nTest series summary.\nFirst Test.\nPlayed in cold weather, the match was essentially decided on the first innings. England batted solidly, with Ted Dexter making 57 and Colin Cowdrey 85, but the largest innings was by Ken Barrington who took 435 minutes to make 137 in what Wisden Cricketers' Almanack termed a \"tedious exhibition\". Motz took five wickets for 108 runs. New Zealand batted badly against the spin of Fred Titmus, and Sutcliffe had to retire hurt after ducking into a bouncer from Fred Trueman. Following on 319 behind, they batted much more consistently, with seven batsmen reaching 40. However, only Pollard, with an undefeated 81, and the recovered Sutcliffe managed to pass 50. England needed 95 to win and the match was over by lunchtime on the fifth day.\nSecond Test.\nEngland left out Barrington because of his dull batting at Edgbaston, and Sutcliffe was not fit for New Zealand. The touring team won the toss and batted and then lost four wickets for 28 runs, all taken by Fred Rumsey at a personal cost of seven runs. Reid and Dick became John Snow's first Test victims on his debut, but Pollard (55) and Taylor (51) added 92 for the seventh wicket. England's reply was built around 119 from Cowdrey and 62 from Dexter, but Collinge finished the innings off with four quick wickets. As at Edgbaston, New Zealand batted much better in their second innings and with 50s from Dowling, Sinclair and Pollard they totalled 347. That left England 216 to win. With 76 for Geoffrey Boycott and an unbeaten 80 from Dexter, the main danger to the win was from the weather, which caused long interruptions on both the final days, England in the end winning with only 15 minutes to spare. The match was Fred Trueman's final Test appearance. His 306th and 307th Test victims were Taylor and Collinge in the first innings.\nThird Test.\nInjuries to Boycott and Dexter led to the recall of John Edrich and Barrington, and their stand of 369 for the second wicket sealed the match. Edrich hit five sixes and 52 fours in an unbeaten 310, the eighth Test score of more than 300 and the third on the Leeds ground after Bradman's 334 and 304 in 1930 and 1934. Barrington made 163 in just over six hours, and England's total was at that stage their highest against New Zealand. New Zealand lost four wickets for 61, but Reid made 54, Pollard 33 and Yuile 46. Even so, New Zealand followed on 353 behind and another patchy batting performance – again Pollard, who hit 53, was an exception – led to a big defeat. The match was all but finished by Titmus taking four wickets in an over, Yuile, Taylor, Motz and Collinge falling respectively to the first, third, fourth and sixth balls. Titmus finished with five wickets for 19 runs off 26 overs. John Edrich opened for England and was not out at the declaration; and New Zealand followed on in an unsuccessful effort to require England to bat again. Edrich was thus on the field for every ball of the game.\nFirst-class matches.\nApart from the Tests, the New Zealanders played 16 other first-class matches, and two one-day warm-up matches. They won three of the first-class games and lost three, though their victories included the matches against Scotland and Ireland, both at that time weaker than the county teams the tourists met.\nBefore the first Test.\nAfter the two warm-up one-day matches against London New Zealand (including Jim Laker) and the Duke of Norfolk's Team, the New Zealanders played a tight game with the County Champions Worcestershire which was distinguished by a 10th wicket partnership of 107 by Motz, who made 95 and Cameron, the highest last-wicket partnership for a New Zealand team in England.\nThe match that followed against Lancashire lost the whole of the first day to rain, and proved pretty much of a disaster. Put into bat, Lancashire reached 225 thanks to Geoff Pullar, and Vivian hurt his ankle, which meant he was unable to bat. New Zealand totalled 115 without him and, under the then rules for a match reduced to two days, followed on. In the second innings, Brian Statham and Ken Higgs reduced the tourists to 8 for six wickets (with Vivian unable to bat). Pollard and Motz ensured respectability by taking the score to 104, but the match was lost by an innings and six runs.\nOff the back of this heavy defeat, the New Zealanders produced one of their better performances, coming from a first-innings deficit to beat Gloucestershire by four wickets. Motz, who took five wickets in the county's second innings, settled the match by hitting three sixes off the England off-spinner John Mortimore.\nThe traditional match between the tourists and the MCC at Lord's saw the New Zealanders have the best of a drawn game against a side containing 10 present or future Test players. Congdon scored 136 in a first innings total of 318 for seven declared; he also scored an unbeaten 50 in the second innings. Rain interfered with the last day's cricket.\nThe run-up to the first Test match involved two drawn games. The match with Nottinghamshire was a low-scoring and slow-scoring match, in which the New Zealanders just held on to draw with one wicket left and 38 runs to make. By contrast, Cambridge University posted a first innings of 364 for nine declared, and then forced the New Zealanders to follow on, dismissing the team for just 137. In the follow-on, Sinclair made 130, Dowling 87 and Congdon 63, and the match petered out to a draw.\nBetween the first and second Tests.\nBetween the first and second Tests the New Zealanders played four county teams, losing the first match to Yorkshire and drawing the other three with Glamorgan, Surrey and Somerset in succession. Yorkshire's total of 419 was built around a century by Brian Close and the tourists followed-on after being bowled out for 134. In their second innings they totalled 208 to lose by an innings and 77 runs. Motz and Congdon made fifties. The Glamorgan game was affected by rain with only 45 minutes play being possible on the final day. Tony Lewis's century was the main contribution in Glamorgan's innings and Reid declared the New Zealand innings 48 runs in arrears at the start of the last day before rain intervened.\nAgainst Surrey Cameron took five for 73 and the New Zealanders batted strongly, with Morgan scoring 110 and Dick, Sinclair and Taylor making fifties in a total of 422 for nine declared in reply to the home team's 248. John Edrich and Ken Barrington scored hundreds for Surrey who saved the game comfortably. The game before the third Test, at Taunton, was also affected by rain and no play took place on the final day. The New Zealanders were reduced to 15 for five in their first innings before Sinclair and Dick led a recovery to total 155. Somerset in turn were bowled out for 196 with Motz's six for 63 leading the bowling. The New Zealanders batted more easily in the second innings, Dowling making 101 before rain closed the match.\nBetween the second and third Tests.\nThe New Zealanders played four further first-class matches between the second and third Tests, drawing with Oxford University and Kent, losing to Warwickshire and drawing with Northamptonshire. The Oxford University game was badly affected by the weather with only the second day seeing a significant amount of play. The tourists scored 285 with Morgan just falling short of a century, Oxford making 137 for three in reply. The New Zealanders had the better of the first innings in the Kent match, declaring on 360 for 8 in reply to the home team's 213 all out in which Cameron's four for 40 was the pick of the bowling. Reid's 165 in under four hours was the mainstay of the New Zealanders' innings but Kent batted well in the second innings to make 285 for six declared and set the tourists 139 to win in 65 minutes, a target which they did not chase, finishing on 17 for three.\nAt Edgbaston the New Zealanders suffered their third defeat of the tour to a county team as Warwickshire won by nine wickets. The tourists declared on 297 for 9 in their first innings with fifties from Jarvis (84) and Vivian (54*), and reduced to Warwickshire to 64 four in reply. An unbeaten partnership of 255 three hours between John Jameson and Tom Cartwright, who scored 137 and 112 respectively allowed Warwickshire to declare on 319 for four. The New Zealanders were bowled out for 219 in their second innings with Reid playing another aggressive innings of 84. This left the home team a target of 198 in just over two-and-a-half hours, which they accomplished with one wicket down and 12 minutes to spare. Billy Ibadulla (93) and M. J. K. Smith (63) put on an unbroken stand of 132 to see Warwickshire home. The New Zealanders final county match of the tour resulted in a draw at Northampton with New Zealand having the better of the match. Northants declared on 282 for seven after rain cut short the first day, with the tourists reply totalling 370 for nine declared. Dick's 96 in 87 minutes was the highlight of the innings with Congdon and Morgan also reaching their fifties. Northants batted slowly on the final day to save the game, finishing on 188 for nine.\nAfter the third Test.\nThe New Zealanders concluded their first-class matches with wins over Scotland in Glasgow by nine wickets and Ireland in Belfast by ten wickets. Scotland were dismissed for 115 after being put in with Cameron taking six wickets. Congdon carried his bat for 176 in the tourists' innings and although Scotland batted better in their second innings the New Zealanders made the 71 required with the loss of one wicket. The Ireland game followed a similar pattern with the tourists taking an 86-run lead and scoring the 32 needed for victory without loss, Sutcliffe making 106 on his last innings in a tour of Britain in the first innings. On their journey home the New Zealanders played non first-class matches against Holland, Somers Isles &amp; Bermuda, Bermuda and Southern California - the first three matches were drawn and the Southern California team were beaten by 64 runs."

        "text": "The New Zealand cricket team toured England in the 1969 season to play a three-match Test series against England. The New Zealanders played in the second half of the English season: the England cricket team played three Test matches against the West Indies cricket team in the earlier part of the season, winning that series by 2–0 with one match drawn - see the article West Indian cricket team in England in 1969.\nEngland won the series against the New Zealanders also by 2–0 with one match drawn. On the tour as a whole, the New Zealanders played 18 first-class matches, including the Tests, and won four of them, with three defeats. All the other matches were drawn.\nAfter this tour the New Zealanders continued touring, playing test series in India and Pakistan till mid November 1969.\nThe New Zealand team.\nThe New Zealand team was captained by Graham Dowling, with Vic Pollard as vice-captain.\nThe full team was:\nSeven of the side – Dowling, Pollard, Collinge, Congdon, Motz, Taylor and Yuile – had toured England with the 1965 touring party. Only Hadlee, Howarth and Wadsworth had not played Test cricket before this tour and all three of them made their Test debuts during the tour. Milburn and Yuile, both of whom had played Test cricket before this tour, did not feature in the Test matches this season.\nThe Test Matches.\nFirst Test at Lord's, 24–28 July 1969.\nThere was little between the teams after low-scoring first innings in which only Ray Illingworth, England's captain, reached 50. In the second innings John Edrich scored 115 and shared a century opening partnership with Geoffrey Boycott. Apart from Turner, who carried his bat for a dour 43, New Zealand did not cope well with Derek Underwood's left-arm spin and his 7-32 gave England a comfortable victory.\nSecond Test at Trent Bridge, 7–12 August 1969.\nAlmost all of the third and fifth days were lost to the weather, so that New Zealand comfortably saved the game in spite of a big deficit on first innings. For New Zealand, Congdon (66) and Hastings (83) put on 150 for the third wicket, at the time a New Zealand record in England. Edrich (155) and Phil Sharpe (111) responded with a second wicket partnership of 246.\nThird Test at The Oval, 21–26 August 1969.\nUnderwood undermined the New Zealand batting, taking six wickets in each innings to finish the series with 24 wickets at an average of 9.16 runs each. Turner made a three-hour 53 in New Zealand's first innings, and Hastings a three-and-a-half-hour 61 in the second, but none of the other batsmen managed more than 30. Edrich made 68 in England's first innings and Mike Denness in his first Test match took England home on the last afternoon with an unbeaten 55. The match was stretched out to the full five days because of constant showers.\nOther First-Class Matches.\nA total of 15 other first-class matches were played between the end of June and the middle of September. A three-day game with D. H. Robins' XI at Eastbourne in mid-June was not counted as first-class.\nThe New Zealanders recorded victories over Scotland, the Minor Counties, Warwickshire and T. N. Pearce's XI. Apart from the defeats in the Test matches, their only other defeat on tour was by Essex by the narrow margin of 15 runs. The 10 other games, all with first-class counties, were drawn."

As a consequence of him having to go to hospital, England required the use of a substitute keeper. At the start of New Zealand's first innings, Bill Athey took on the role but it was decided after only a few overs that a specialist was needed. By chance, former England wicket-keeper Bob Taylor, who had retired from first-class cricket, was in the hospitality tent. With the consent of the New Zealand captain Jeremy Coney, Taylor was persuaded to don a borrowed set of pads (although he had had the foresight to bring his gloves with him) and keep wicket for England for the rest of day 2. The following day, England were permitted to call up Bobby Parks of Hampshire as a substitute for the remainder of New Zealand's first innings. The fourth day of the schedule was a rest day, while on day 4 England batted for the second time. Bruce French was finally able to return for New Zealand's second innings on the final day."

        "text": "The New Zealand cricket team toured England in the 1994 season, and were scheduled to play three Test matches and two One Day Internationals. Earlier in 1994, the New Zealanders had lost a home series to Pakistan, 2–1, with the reverse swing of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis proving decisive. They also drew a one-off test with India, and split the ODI series with their two opponents evenly.\nEngland were returning from defeat in the Caribbean, and had a new Chairman of Selectors - Ray Illingworth - who was expected to make changes to the squad. He duly did: Peter Such and Phillip DeFreitas were both recalled at the start of the summer, and Steve Rhodes, Craig White and Darren Gough all made their debuts in Illingworth's first days in charge.\nThe tourists' preparations were severely hampered by bad weather, which forced the abandonment of the second ODI, and injury - strike bowler Danny Morrison was ruled out of any part in the Test series.\nTest matches.\nFirst Test (2–6 June).\nRay Illingworth's new broom was in evidence in the First Test, with wicket-keeper Steve Rhodes and all-rounder Craig White making their Test debuts for England, while Phillip DeFreitas and Peter Such, who missed the winter tour to the Caribbean, was recalled to the England side. For New Zealand, vice-captain Gavin Larsen made his Test debut, as did quick bowler Heath Davis.\nThe tourists won the toss and batted, but after surviving the initial burst from Devon Malcolm, the top order succumbed to DeFreitas (4-94), who drew three edges into the slip cordon and had captain Ken Rutherford adjudged lbw. Stephen Fleming (54) was the only batsman to have any answer to the England bowlers as New Zealand slipped to 108/5. Adam Parore and Matthew Hart put up some late-order resistance, but could only help the visitors to a total of 251. Coach Keith Fletcher described DeFreitas's efforts as \"the best I have seen him bowl for a while\" at the close of the first day.\nIn reply, England lost Alec Stewart very early, hitting Davis to Larsen at mid-on, but Graham Gooch, back in the side after opting to miss the tour of the West Indies, and Mike Atherton dug in and batted out the remainder of the day. The stand was broken at a superb 263 early on the third day, with Atherton falling for 101, but Gooch continued on his merry way, including adding a good stand with Robin Smith (78) before he eventually went for 210 (29 fours) in an innings just short of seven hours. Smith and Rhodes (49) added 68, and DeFreitas added to his earlier bowling exploits with a quick-fire half-century, before Atherton declared the innings on the fourth morning.\nNew Zealand's second innings started smoothly, with Blair Hartland and Bryan Young adding 59 before Hartland became DeFreitas's hundredth Test victim. Young went on to make 53, but that ended up being the tourists highest score. Such bowled extremely economically in the middle of the innings, his 34 overs conceding just 50 runs, and he picked up the wickets of Rutherford and Shane Thomson, and although Parore once again dug in to try to restore some pride, when DeFreitas (5-71) returned he wiped up the tail, finally removing Parore (42) caught behind as the last wicket.\nBetween the First and Second Tests, noted cricket writer Scyld Berry praised Atherton's captaincy and called for England to be ruthless and dominate the rest of the series in the same manner as they had won the First Test, noting that \"a full length and a little swing are enough to expose New Zealand\", who seemed heavily dependent on big scores from Martin Crowe to make a game of it.\nSecond Test (16–20 June).\nThe Second Test saw Malcolm replaced by Paul Taylor, while Blair Pocock came into the New Zealand line-up for Hartland and bowlers Chris Pringle and Michael Owens replaced Davis and Larsen. New Zealand won the toss and batted first again, and although Rutherford and Fleming made starts, they looked in trouble at 138/4. Martin Crowe turned the innings around though: he and Shane Thomson (69) added 180 for the fifth wicket, a new record against England, with Crowe despatching the ball to all parts of the ground, despite struggling with a leg injury that saw him hobbling around late in the day. He was eventually caught at midwicket for 142, but Parore and Dion Nash (56) pushed the score up to 476.\nAtherton and Alec Stewart got England's reply off to a solid start, but then the hosts slipped to 101/4. Graeme Hick (58) and White (51) added 92, stabilising the innings, and Rhodes made an unbeaten 32 in nearly four hours, but with limited support from the tail: Angus Fraser hung around for more than an hour, but England's total was definitely sub-par, and they only just scraped past the follow-on mark. Nash (6-76) starred with the ball for the New Zealanders and Hart was miserly, with figures of 44-21-50-1.\nDeFreitas made quick work of the New Zealand top order the next morning, having Pocock and Rutherford leg before and Crowe clean bowled before any of them could make double figures, and at 29/3, it looked as though England make a comeback in the match. Young (94) and Fleming, and then Thomson, dug in and allowed the visitors to set a fourth innings target of 407 for England, which looked in danger when Atherton and Stewart got off to a flyer. Nash grabbed the wickets of Atherton and Gooch early on the final morning to stem the flow and set up a more tense day, but Stewart was undeterred, and added 76 with Smith and 74 with Hick, before also falling to Nash (5-93). White, DeFreitas and Fraser all fell quickly, giving the tourists hope of levelling the series, but Rhodes batted for two hours for his 24 not out, and England held on for the draw.\nNew Zealand were indebted to Crowe's batting and Nash's bowling, and came close to recording the victory. England skipper Atherton admitted that he'd found it too tense to watch the final half-hour, while Rutherford bemoaned the bad light that prevented him using his quicker bowlers at the end and felt they deserved to win, noting that \"a draw wasn't a true reflection of the game\".\nThird Test (30 June - 5 July).\nPrior to the Third Test there was considerable debate in the English press about whether Robin Smith and Graeme Hick should retain their places in the England side after their recent failures, and vocal support for the inclusion of Graham Thorpe. However, the only change to the team saw Darren Gough make his Test debut in place of Paul Taylor. The visitors also made one change, Mark Greatbatch returning to the side to open the innings in place of Blair Pocock.\nAtherton won the toss and chose to bat, a decision that his fellow top order batsmen made a mockery of as they collapsed around him to the seam of Nash and Owens. From 104/4 though, White (42) provided his captain with some support, and although 199/4 at the close of the first day wasn't a great score, it showed Atherton's character. Unbeaten on 96 overnight, he quickly moved to his century, but almost immediately lost White to Owens. When Atherton was finally dismissed for 111, and Rhodes followed him soon after, England's total (235/7) looked anaemic, but some solid late-order hitting from Gough (65) and DeFreitas (69) sent the New Zealand fielders scurrying to all parts of the ground, and they added a superb 130 before DeFreitas missed a straight one from Owens.\nThe tourists' reply started badly, with Gough and DeFreitas combining excellently with ball as well as bat, and removing the top four before the close on the second day, with only Martin Crowe defying the England seamers. Day three saw the pattern continue - Crowe (70) blasted his way through the bowling, but none of the other New Zealanders had an answer. Their coach, Geoff Howarth commented that \"There were too many bad shots to get out, a lack\nof timing, feet not moving to the pitch of the ball, that sort of thing\", indicating it was a lack of application, rather than lack of ability that was the problem.\nHowarth's comments were emphasised with four wickets falling in similar fashion very quickly in the follow-on, leaving New Zealand 73/4, and with more than two full days still to play only an England victory looked likely. Crowe (115) and Parore (71) dug in though, adding 141 for the sixth wicket, a new record for the sixth wicket against England. Their partnership proved vital as the elements came to the visitors rescue - only 40 overs play was possible over the final two days - and although DeFreitas returned on the final day to pick up the wickets of the two stalwarts, New Zealand hung on for a draw.\nOne-day Internationals.\nFirst ODI (19 May).\nDarren Gough and Shaun Udal made their One-day International debuts for England. Chris Pringle's five wicket haul was his only one in ODIs.\nSecond ODI (21 May).\nMatch abandoned without a ball being bowled because of rain/ground conditions.\nTour summary.\nEngland.\nRay Illingworth's first series in charge of the England side provided an insight into his selection policies, with the inclusion of Gough, White, and DeFreitas as prongs of the attack to supplement the tireless Fraser and erratic Malcolm, and the retention of the old guard of batsmen at the expense of younger talent such as Thorpe and John Crawley.\nAtherton looked solid as captain, and proved that the greater pressure the team is under, the more he is able to respond with the bat - an excellent trait - but his skills in the field have yet to be seriously tested.\nThe series was won comfortably, and the performances of Atherton and DeFreitas in particular very encouraging for future series', but the New Zealanders presented less of a challenge than they might have done, and the result was as much a reflection of that as of the England performance. The subsequent series against South Africa would provide more of a benchmark for the team.\nMike Selvey commented on the success of the summer in \"The Guardian\", but with caution: \"To give all credit to Illingworth, however, would be wrong. English Test cricket began its upward mobility pre-Raymond, when Atherton was appointed captain. In the West Indies, with a young side, the learning curve went up as the tour progressed\", and noted that \"His loyalty to\nRobin Smith and Graeme Hick is probably going beyond the pale...the team must move on beyond these two...\"\nNew Zealand.\nNew Zealand will have been very disappointed by their performances on this tour, consistently failing to deliver on their potential, and underperforming against the counties and in two of the three Tests. Only at Lord's, where they were unlucky not to win did they show the sort of attitude and performance that they could have displayed throughout the tour.\nIn fairness, the tourists were shorn of key members of their bowling attack: Danny Morrison made the tour party but was not fit to take part in the Test series, whilst Chris Cairns and Simon Doull did not make the squad. However, the bowling was less of a concern than the batting. Dion Nash performed superbly, picking up 17 wickets and Michael Owens and Matthew Hart provided admirable support, if lacking penetration. Captain Ken Rutherford noted at the end of the series that \"...the balance of our side with Thomson, Hart and the three\nseamers is a good one. If we had Danny Morrison, Chris Cairns and Nash as our three front liners, that's useful.\" \nOf the batsmen, only Martin Crowe and Adam Parore play consistently well. Bryan Young and Shane Thomson made promising cameos, and Stephen Fleming also looked a good prospect for the future, but New Zealand's reliance on Crowe's runs was evident in this series. The tourists only came close to winning the match he scored most heavily in, and he saved the Third Test with two vital innings providing the core of the resistance.\nFollowing the series, partly in response to criticism from former Kiwi captain Glenn Turner, New Zealand Cricket announced that several of the problems identified during the tour were already being addressed, with new injury/fitness regimes being implemented.\nExternal sources.\nCricketArchive"

The series was won 3–0 by England, the first time they had won a Test series between the two teams since 1997. During the tour New Zealand also played in the NatWest Series, which was a triangular One Day International tournament featuring the West Indies and England.\nEngland were forced into a change of captain for the first match of the series after Michael Vaughan twisted his knee during batting practice. His departure meant that Marcus Trescothick was named as the stand-in captain and Andrew Strauss was called into the team to make his debut. After scoring 112 in the first innings, becoming only the fourth player to score a debut century at Lord's, and 83 in the second, Strauss was named the player of the match. The opening match of the series was also significant because it was the final match of former England captain Nasser Hussain's career, he made 103 not out in England's second innings and hit the winning runs.\nThe players of the series were named as Steve Harmison of England and Mark Richardson of New Zealand. Harmison took 21 wickets, nine more than any other bowler in the series, at an average of 22.09 with best innings figures of 4/74. Richardson was the highest run-scorer of the series, he finished with 369 runs at an average of 61.50 and a highest score of 101."

        "text": "The Pakistani cricket team toured England in the 1954 season. The team played four Test matches against England, winning one, losing one and drawing two. These were the first Test matches played between the two sides. In winning the fourth and final Test, Pakistan became the first side to win a Test on its inaugural tour of England.\nThe team played 26 other first-class matches and two minor games: they won eight of the first-class matches and one of the other games, and lost two first-class matches. In a wet summer, 19 matches, including two Tests and one of the minor games, were drawn.\nTest series summary.\nFirst Test.\nPlay throughout the first Test match was limited to only eight hours, after heavy rain had saturated the outfield. It was the first time that the first three days of a match had been washed out at Lord's. Play began at 3:45pm on the fourth afternoon, and England captain Len Hutton won the toss and elected to bowl first. Pakistan scored slowly that afternoon, reaching fifty for three wickets; with Hanif Mohammad \"scarcely ever attempting a scoring stroke\" The following day, Pakistan's remaining seven wickets were taken in eighty minutes, with Brian Statham taking four wickets for ten runs in his morning spell. England took risks in attempting to score quick runs, hoping to declare and force an innings victory. However, England lost wickets regularly which interrupted the flow of their attack, and when Hutton declared England were 117 for 9. Pakistan managed to bat for the remainder of the match, securing the draw.\nSecond Test.\nLen Hutton was unfit, so David Sheppard captained the side in his absence. His opposite number Abdul Kardar won the toss and decided to bat first. After around an hour, Sheppard called upon Bob Appleyard to bowl for the first time in Test cricket. Within 26 balls, Appleyard reduced Pakistan from 37 for one to 55 for five, bowling a mixture of off cutters, leg cutters and inswingers. Despite a recovery from the tail, Pakistan were all out for 157. By the end of the first day, England had moved to 121/2, with Sheppard and May the dismissed batsmen. On the second morning, Pakistan bowler Fazal Mahmood injured his leg and had to bowl with a shortened run. Simpson was eventually dismissed for 101, while his batting partner Denis Compton was dropped on 20; he went on to score 278. Tom Graveney also scored a half-century, and England declared their innings on 558/6. Pakistan needed 401 to avoid an innings defeat, with two days play remaining. However, the rain fell again, reducing the playing time on the fourth day drastically. Nonetheless, Pakistan were all out for 272 just before lunch on day five.\nThird Test.\nSheppard, again deputising for Hutton, won the toss and elected to bat first. In yet another rain-affected match, England reached 293/6 by the close of the first day, with Compton making 93 and Graveney 65. Pakistan's bowling relied heavily on Shujauddin who bowled 37 overs that day. The second day fell entirely to rain, and on the third morning England batted for an hour before declaring. Pakistan started their reply well, but the rain-affected pitch favoured the bowlers. Pakistan lost wickets rapidly, with Johnny Wardle taking four for 19 and Jim McConnon, on his debut, three for 19 and four catches. The touring side were forced to follow on after being dismissed for 90. They limped to 25 for 4 in their second innings before the end of the third day, before the weather came to their rescue, washing out the final two days.\nFourth Test.\nHutton returned, and England gave debuts to Peter Loader and Frank Tyson, who had been selected for the winter tour to Australia. Rain delayed the start and Pakistan were soon in trouble, falling to 51 for seven before Kardar and the tail effected a small recovery. Tyson and Loader took seven wickets between them. Torrential rain washed out the second day, and when England batted on the Saturday the pitch helped the Pakistani medium-fast bowlers, Fazal Mahmood and Mahmood Hussain, who took six and four wickets respectively. Every batsman was caught. For a second time, Pakistan were rescued by the tail, which doubled the score from 82 for eight to 164, with Wazir Mohammad making an unbeaten 43. Johnny Wardle took seven for 56 but lacked support. When Reg Simpson, Peter May and Denis Compton took England to 109 for two, an England victory looked a formality, but lower-order timidity against Fazal, who took a further six wickets to finish with 12 for 99 in the match, brought a famous victory after only 55 minutes on the fifth day."

        "title": "Pakistani cricket team in England in 1962",
        "text": "The Pakistan cricket team toured England in the 1962 season to play a five-match Test series against England. They also played a match in Ireland. The team is officially termed the Second Pakistanis as it was their second tour of England, following their inaugural tour in 1954. The Test series was the third between the two teams after those in England in 1954 and in Pakistan in 1961–62. Ted Dexter captained England in four Tests and Colin Cowdrey in one; Javed Burki captained Pakistan in all five Tests. England won the series 4–0 with one match drawn.\nThe Second Pakistanis played 36 matches in all, 29 of them rated first-class including the five Tests. They won only four of their first-class fixtures and lost eight, the other 17 matches being drawn. Their outstanding player on tour was Mushtaq Mohammad, who was selected as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year.\nBackground.\nPakistan were visiting England for the second time. Their first tour was in 1954 and it resulted in a 1–1 series draw, a highly creditable result for a team that was then new to Test cricket. In the meantime, Pakistan had largely held together the nucleus of the 1954 team but by 1962 it had become necessary to make several changes, with the result that the 1962 team was carrying too many inexperienced players. \"Wisden\" commented upon the recent development in Pakistani cricket of replacing matting pitches with \"very dead turf pitches\". The nature of such pitches is that they allow for little movement of the ball off a straight line of delivery and so create easy batting conditions which, consequently, inhibit development of the skills necessary to perform well on all sorts of pitch. As a result, most of the Pakistani batsmen had difficulty in English conditions against pace and seam where there is considerable deviation of the ball as it moves through the air. The 1962 Pakistanis suffered accordingly against the English pace bowlers as is shown by the series statistics in that 96 Pakistani wickets fell during the five matches and 73 were taken by pace or seam bowlers, only 21 by spinners and there were two run outs. Fred Trueman, England's main exponent of the \"outswinger\" took 22 wickets in only four Tests.\nIn England itself, the series against Pakistan was seemingly a secondary consideration. \"Playfair 1962\" began its editorial with an apology to \"the fine players of Pakistan\" because everyone was supposedly looking ahead to the following winter's tour of Australia. The whole point of the editorial, indeed its title, was \"Who will lead in Australia?\" A year later, England having failed to regain The Ashes, \"Wisden\" commented that \"the season of 1962 was spoiled to a large extent by rain and main interest centred on finding a team to go to Australia\". Although the era of amateur status in first-class cricket was about to end, the three contenders for the leadership of England were all amateurs: Colin Cowdrey, Ted Dexter and David Sheppard. Dexter had just led England in its 1961–62 winter tour of the sub-continent and retained the captaincy for the tour of Australia.\nThe 1962 Test series followed the 1961–62 series in Pakistan that had ended on 7 February 1962. England had moved on to Ceylon, playing three matches there till 18 February, and then home. In the 1961–62 Pakistan season, the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy ended on 3 January and was won by Karachi Blues, who beat Combined Services by 4 wickets. The Ayub Trophy ran from 16 March to 4 April when the final ended. It was won by Karachi, who beat North Zone by 316 runs. 24 days later, on 28 April, Pakistan began their 1962 tour of England at Arundel Castle Cricket Ground against the Duke of Norfolk's XI.\nPakistan squad.\nBecause of injuries, the Second Pakistanis used 21 players in their 29 first-class matches. The team was captained by Javed Burki with Hanif Mohammad as his vice-captain. The team manager was Brigadier R. G. (\"Gussy\") Haider with Major S. A. Rahman as his assistant. Squad details below state the player's 1961–62 club team, his age at the beginning of the tour, his batting hand and his type of bowling:\nPakistan used seventeen players in the Test series. The four who did not play in the series were Afaq Hussain, who made six tour appearances; Asif Ahmed, who made nine; Haseeb Ashan, who sustained a foot injury in the second match and went home soon afterwards; and Shuja-ud-Din Butt, who was only accompanying the tour party but was needed to play against Hampshire as an emergency stand-in. Five players took part in all five Tests: Hanif Mohammad, Javed Burki, Mushtaq Mohammad, Nasim-ul-Ghani and Saeed Ahmed. The squad included two non-Muslim players, Mathias and D'Souza.\nEngland Test selections.\nEngland selected a total of 19 players in the five Tests. Only two players (Ted Dexter and Peter Parfitt) played in all five matches. Details of each England player includes the county club he represented in 1962, his age at the beginning of the season, his batting hand and his style of bowling:\nTour itinerary.\nThe following is a list of the 36 matches played by the Second Pakistanis. 29 are rated as first-class fixtures. Test matches are listed in bold. The matches in \"italics\" were not first-class.\nTest series.\nEngland and Pakistan played five Tests between May and August. England won the series 4–0 with one match drawn:\nFirst Test.\nEngland, captained by Ted Dexter, selected Colin Cowdrey as an opening batsman alongside Geoff Pullar; Cowdrey normally batted at three or four in the order. The team consisted of six specialist batsmen, wicket-keeper Geoff Millman, two spinners and two pace bowlers, supplemented by Dexter as a third seamer. Pakistan, captained by Javed Burki, selected seven batsman, including the keeper Imtiaz Ahmed. They surprisingly omitted Mohammad Farooq and left themselves with one pace bowler, Mahmood Hussain. Their other three bowlers were seamer Antao D'Souza, leg spinner Intikhab Alam and all-rounder Nasim-ul-Ghani who bowled a mixture of left arm seam and orthodox spin.\nDexter won the toss, for only the second time in nine Tests as captain, and chose to bat first. England promptly established a pattern for the whole series by accumulating a large score. Cowdrey and Peter Parfitt made centuries, Tom Graveney 97, David Allen 79 not out and Dexter 72. Parfitt's century was his second in successive innings against Pakistan, following 111 at Karachi in February. All four Pakistan bowlers conceded 100-plus runs. \"Wisden\" commented on the \"tremendous amount of work\" that fell on Mahmood and D'Souza, given that the two slower bowlers were \"terribly expensive\". England declared during lunch on the second day (Friday) at 544 for 5. \"Playfair\" noted that Imtiaz Ahmed, Pakistan's wicket-keeper, did not concede a single bye in this large total. \"Playfair\" also recorded that there was a short delay before lunch on the first day, caused by the arrival of a mouse in the centre of the field.\nApart from Mushtaq Mohammad, who made 63, none of the Pakistani batsmen reached a half-century and they were all out for 246 shortly before lunch on Saturday. With a deficit of 298, Dexter enforced the follow-on. Pakistan in their second innings made a better start with Hanif Mohammad and Ijaz Butt putting on 60 for the first wicket. Even so, four wickets fell before close of play and Pakistan went into the rest day on 158 for four, still 140 in arrears. On the fourth day (Monday), Brian Statham took two quick wickets and Pakistan's fate was sealed despite resistance by Saeed Ahmed, who scored 65. England's bowlers shared the wickets: Statham took six in the match, Allen and Tony Lock five each and Fred Trueman four. The match ended on Monday afternoon, Pakistan all out for 274 and England winning by an innings and 24 runs.\nSecond Test.\nEngland announced an unchanged team but, in the run-up to the match, the two Lancashire players Pullar and Statham were injured and had to withdraw. Their replacements were opening batsman Micky Stewart and fast-medium bowler Len Coldwell, who both earned their first Test cap. Pakistan brought Farooq into the team this time, replacing Intikhab, and preferred the veteran batsman Alim-ud-Din as opener to Butt. As in the first Test, Dexter and Burki were the team captains.\nBurki won a toss he \"would probably have preferred to lose\". The conditions did not favour batting as there was heavy cloud and a \"green\" pitch. Nevertheless, Burki was uneasy about batting last and decided to bat first. They found Trueman almost unplayable and collapsed to 76 for six at lunch. They were all out within an hour of the resumption for exactly 100. Trueman, who took full advantage of the conditions, claimed six wickets for 31 and Coldwell, who provided good support on his debut, three for 25. Pakistan's best score was 17 by Nasim. As \"Wisden\" pointed out, Pakistan's undoing once again was their unpreparedness for the ball that \"swings and lifts\". England took the lead without undue difficulty, largely thanks to a quick 65 by Dexter, and ended the first day on 176 for four.\nOn the second day (Friday), Graveney \"batted beautifully\", especially his cover driving, to score 153 despite receiving minimal help from his partners except Trueman, with whom he added 76 for the ninth wicket. Farooq was Pakistan's best bowler but he injured his ankle during the second day and could not bowl after that. Pakistan began the third innings of the match with a deficit of 270 and were soon reduced to 77 for four, leaving Burki and Nasim together at close of play.\nMost people expected an early finish on the Saturday but Burki and Nasim rallied and added 197 runs for the fifth wicket. At the time, it was a fifth wicket record for Pakistan in all Test cricket and their record stand for any wicket against England. Both batsmen scored 101. It was Nasim's first century and Burki's third against England in five matches. Pakistan were all out soon after tea for 370, leaving England to score 86 to win. Coldwell took six for 85 and finished his debut with nine wickets in the match, Trueman also taking nine. With ninety minutes left on the third day, England reached their target before the close for the loss of only Cowdrey's wicket.\nThird Test.\nBrian Statham was fit again and, despite his good performance at Lord's, Coldwell had to give way. England also recalled John Murray, replacing Geoff Millman as the keeper, and preferred Fred Titmus to Tony Lock who was expensive during the Burki-Nasim stand at Lord's. Pakistan, whose injury problems were beginning to mount up, made three changes because Imtiaz, Wallis Mathias and D'Souza could not play. Their replacements were Butt, who had played at Edgbaston but not at Lord's, fast-medium bowler Munir Malik and off-spinner Javed Akhtar who had literally just arrived from Pakistan, having been called up as a reinforcement. With the winter tour still more on the minds of the England selectors than anything else, they decided to let Cowdrey captain the team in this match. Javed Burki captained Pakistan as in the two previous Tests.\nBurki won the toss and asked England to bat first, the first time a Pakistan captain had ever taken that option in Test cricket. Burki had assessed the conditions well because there was a heavy sky and a \"green\" pitch to help his seamers Mahmood, Farooq and Munir. England struggled on the first day, reduced to just over four hours by rain, and were 194 for six at the close with Parfitt and Murray the not out batsmen. \"Wisden\" said that it was Pakistan's \"best day of the tour so far\".\nOn the second day (Friday), England took charge again and Parfitt completed his third century in four Tests against Pakistan. Allen scored 62 and there were useful scores by Trueman and Statham as the \"tail wagged\". Pakistan's injury problem reached crisis point as both Mahmood and Farooq broke down and neither played again on the tour. Munir, left as the sole pace and seam bowler, was overworked and deservedly captured five wickets. \"Wisden\" questioned Burki's captaincy in the situation. England were all out before tea for 428, a much higher score than expected after their struggle on Thursday. Hanif had a hand injury so Alim was restored to his old job of opening the innings with Butt. Pakistan reached 73 for three at the close, losing the wickets of Butt, Saeed and Mushtaq.\nThere was a complete collapse on Saturday morning with only Alim, who scored 50, playing with any confidence. Pakistan were all out for 131 and Cowdrey enforced the follow-on. England's best bowler was Dexter, nominally the third seamer, who took four for 10. Titmus, who bowled only four overs, took two for 3, including the key wicket of Alim. Alim again played well in the second innings but his only support came from Saeed. They both made half-centuries but the rest of the team were dismissed cheaply and they were all out for 180, Statham taking four for 50. As at Lord's, the match was completed in three days and England had won the series, three up and two to go.\nFourth Test.\nTed Dexter was restored to the captaincy but it is not known if this would have happened anyway or if it was because Colin Cowdrey was unfit and could not play. Whichever, Dexter now held the England captaincy for the next two years until the end of the 1964 season. England having won the series, the selectors decided to make changes to help them decide who should go on the winter tour. Geoff Pullar, fit again, was recalled and his opening partner was the third tour captaincy candidate David Sheppard, who had recently revived his cricket career at Sussex. They replaced Cowdrey and Stewart. Tony Lock was brought back in place of Allen and all-rounder Barry Knight came in as an extra bowler, replacing the out-of-form Kenny Barrington. Pakistan's dire injury troubles necessitated changes in their lineup. They had flown their old master bowler Fazal Mahmood out as a reinforcement. Imtiaz was fit again, Intikhab was recalled and Shahid Mahmood was introduced, making his Test debut as opening batsman. They replaced Mahmood, Farooq, Butt and Akhtar.\nBurki repeated his tactic at Leeds by putting England in to bat after winning the toss. At that time, the pitch was \"green\" and the sky overcast so Burki hoped that Fazal and Munir would benefit from the conditions. Unfortunately, heavy rain began before play could start and the entire day was lost. Play began promptly on Friday morning when the conditions were better for batting, so Pakistan really were not having much luck. After Pullar was soon out, the Sussex pairing of Sheppard and Dexter added 161 for the second wicket. Significantly for the winter tour, Dexter batted brilliantly but Sheppard was struggling to find his touch. Both were out within a few minutes of each other and Graveney was joined by Parfitt. They shared a partnership of 184 for the fourth wicket which ended when Graveney was dismissed for 114, his fourth century of the summer against the Pakistanis. The innings ended just before lunch on Saturday when a heavy shower began with Parfitt close to his century. He faced one more ball with heavy rain falling and managed to reach 101 not out. Dexter promptly declared at 428 for five. It was Parfitt's fifth century of the summer against the Pakistanis (he had just scored two in one match against them for Middlesex) and his sixth in seven innings including the one in Karachi.\nPakistan's batsmen struggled again, Hanif being dismissed by Trueman off only the second ball of the innings, and they were 127 for six at the close on Saturday. Only Mushtaq and Saeed could offer any resistance. Nasim made 41 on Monday morning and almost saved the follow-on but they were all out for 219, 209 behind. In the second innings, Hanif was again dismissed quickly and Pakistan were 11 for one at close of play on Monday. As the final day got under way, another collapse looked inevitable until Mushtaq and Saeed held England at bay with a stand of 107 for the fourth wicket. With 65 minutes to go on Tuesday evening, Pakistan with five wickets left needed 22 runs more to avoid the innings defeat, Mushtaq and Shahid batting. There was then a dramatic over bowled by Trueman which could have won the game for England. First, Mushtaq was missed by substitute fielder Cyril Poole at long leg and then Shahid, who had not scored, was dropped by Titmus at slip. Pakistan batted on and Mushtaq completed a deserved century just before the close, scoring exactly 100 not out. It was his second Test century and he became the first player in Test history to achieve a second century before the age of 20. Pakistan ended on 216 for six, a lead of just seven runs, and the match was drawn.\nFifth Test.\nFor a match of academic interest, England made six changes. Pullar was unfit and they left out Graveney, Lock, Statham, Titmus and Trueman in order to give a chance to other tour contenders and, it was said, \"to avoid calling too heavily on the counties (i.e., Surrey, Warwickshire, Worcestershire and Yorkshire) engaged in the fight for the County Championship\". This latter reason was an odd one because while they allowed Trueman to play for Yorkshire, they selected Ray Illingworth; while they allowed Graveney to play for Worcestershire, they recalled Coldwell; while they allowed Lock to play for Surrey, they recalled Barrington; and they did not pick anyone from Warwickshire. The Championship ended with Yorkshire narrowly ahead of Worcestershire, the other two losing ground in the last week of August. Besides Barrington, Coldwell and Illingworth, England brought back Allen and Cowdrey and gave a first cap to pace bowler David Larter. Pakistan's team changed again with Butt and Imtiaz opening the innings. Hanif batted at number six and Shahid was left out. Alim was injured and replaced by Mathias. D'Souza was recalled in place of Munir.\nThe selection of Illingworth for this match was ironic in one sense. All through the summer, there had been speculation about which of Cowdrey, Dexter or Sheppard (amateurs all) would lead England in Australia to try and recover The Ashes. In the final Test against Pakistan, they occupied the first three positions in the England batting order. England failed to recover The Ashes on the 1962–63 tour and it was not until the 1970–71 tour that they finally succeeded, under the leadership of the professional Ray Illingworth.\nDexter won the toss and decided to bat first. Following a slow start by Sheppard and Cowdrey, the run rate accelerated in the afternoon via a second wicket partnership of 248 between Cowdrey and Dexter. Cowdrey made his highest Test score of 182 in this innings and Dexter scored 172. Barrington, who had surprisingly scored few runs in the series so far, made an unbeaten half-century. England declared at 480 for five and Pakistan again struggled against pace and seam. Imtiaz, Mushtaq and Hanif all scored 40-plus but then got out. Dexter wisely decided to use the giant Larter in short bursts and he claimed nine wickets in his debut Test (just as Coldwell had done in his debut at Lord's). Pakistan were all out in their first innings for only 183 and, on Saturday morning, were asked to follow on. Imtiaz played a fine innings on Saturday but, sadly, was out only two short of a century. Mushtaq, Burki and Mathias all put up resistance but Pakistan were 289 for six at the close and, after Mathias was run out in the first over on Monday, the end soon came. England won by an innings with well over a day to spare.\nOther matches.\nAs well as their injury problems, the Pakistanis were frequently dogged by bad weather and most of their 17 drawn matches on the tour were because of rain, including the fourth Test as described above. The tour began at Arundel on Saturday, 28 April with the first of three one-day games (not limited overs). The first two were drawn and the Pakistanis won the third one against Colonel Stevens' XI. These three matches were, in effect, warm-ups only and not first-class.\nThe opening first-class fixture was against Worcestershire at New Road, starting on Wednesday, 2 May. The Pakistanis were given a foretaste of the Test series to come in that Tom Graveney scored a century for the home team (and was presented with his county cap immediately afterwards) and their batsmen struggled against the pace and seam of Jack Flavell and Len Coldwell.\nAftermath.\nShuja-ud-Din Butt, who had accompanied the tour in a non-playing capacity but was nevertheless needed to play against Hampshire because of the injury situation, became a cricket writer in later life and he summarised the 1962 tour as \"the lowest and most depressing point in the history of Pakistan cricket\". It was not until 1987 that Pakistan were granted a five-Test series in England again; on their five tours between 1962 and 1987, they played three Tests in each series and were co-visitors along with either India or New Zealand."

        "text": "The Pakistani cricket team toured England in the 1992 English cricket season, the first tour since the acrimonious visit by England to Pakistan in 1987/88, which was highlighted by the Mike Gatting/Shakoor Rana dispute. Five Test matches and five One Day Internationals were scheduled, running from May to August.\nThe Test series was won 2–1 by Pakistan, who fielded a consistently strong team led by Javed Miandad and featuring the batting talent of Saleem Malik and the strike bowling partnership of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis as well as the guile of Leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed. England's batting was also strong, with Alec Stewart, Graham Gooch and Robin Smith excelling, but they lacked a consistent bowling threat.\nThe Pakistani opening bowlers developed prodigious Reverse swing with the old ball, and ripped through the England tail on numerous occasions. Although the quality of those batsmen could certainly be called into question, the ease with which Wasim and Waqar dismissed the lower order was a significant and series-winning difference for Pakistan.\nTension between the teams bubbled beneath the surface throughout the tour. In the third test, Aaqib Javed was warned by the umpires for intimidatory bowling at Devon Malcolm, which riled up the Pakistan team. Accusations of ball tampering to produce their reverse swing were levied at Wasim and Waqar through the British press, after they were reported to the ICC Match Referee after a One-day International at Lord's. The accusations led to a high-level inquiry, but ultimately no players had action taken against them and the furore eventually died away.\nEngland won the One-day International series 4–1, with Stewart, Smith, Graeme Hick and Neil Fairbrother leading the batting.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nPlay was only possible from the end of the second scheduled day, and both teams made heavy weather of bowling their opponents out. Big centuries from Miandad and Malik put the tourists in a commanding position, but they were stymied by only having a day and a half to bowl England out twice, and once Stewart had settled into his innings the draw was the only likely outcome.\nDeFreitas, Lewis and Pringle shouldered the bulk of the bowling for England, but only the former enjoyed any success, his four wickets reward for perseverance. For the Pakistanis, Mushtaq Ahmed bowled 50 overs for just two wickets, and Ata-ur-Rehman, on debut, seemed under-used in hindsight, bowling just 18 overs in the innings.\nThis match is also notable for the debut of Inzamam-ul-Haq, who made 8 not out.\n2nd Test.\nAfter winning the toss and electing to bat, England initially looked to be in a promising position as Gooch and Stewart put on 123 for the first wicket. This turned out to be the biggest partnership of the match though, as from that point on, wickets fell at regular intervals. Waqar Younis ripped the heart out of the England middle order, removing Lamb, Botham and Lewis on the way to figures of 5–91. Pakistan's reply featured half-centuries from Aamir Sohail, Asif Mujtaba and Salim Malik, but they could only establish a first innings lead of 38, Malcolm and DeFreitas the pick of England's bowlers.\nSecond time around, only Stewart (69*) could muster any resistance, with Extras contributing the next highest score (28) in a total of 175. Wasim Akram's 4–66 was earned mostly at the expense of England's tail. Pakistan made their target of 138 look like hard work, falling to 18–3 and 95–8 with Lewis (3–43) and Ian Salisbury (3–49) their main tormentors. Once again, Wasim and Waqar combined to win the match – only this time with the bat. A dogged 45 not out from Wasim and strong support from Waqar (20*) saw Pakistan home.\nIan Salisbury's maiden Test innings ended Hit wicket. He also acted as Nightwatchman in the second innings.\n3rd Test.\nWith Pakistan already in a commanding position (388/3), no play was possible on the second day, making the chance of a result much less likely. Both sides attacked the bowling with relish, and Aamir Sohail's 205 was his first Test century in only his third match. Ramiz Raja, Asif Mujtaba and Javed Miandad all made half centuries as well, and only Gooch was able to stem the flow of runs, his 18 overs going for just 39.\nEngland's reply was rather stop-start. Although Gooch, Gower, and Lewis all made half-centuries, none went on to make a really big score, and England looked in trouble at various points of in innings being 42/2, 200/5 and 256/7, before Salisbury and the debuting Tim Munton added 64 for the ninth wicket. Pakistan's pace trio of Wasim, Waqar and Aaqib Javed did the bulk of the bowling.\nThe final day saw Ramiz make another half-century, but the game petered out into a draw.\n4th Test.\nThe overcast sky and seaming pitch made the selection of England's nearly-man Neil Mallender for his debut look inspired. England's all-seam attack rattled through the Pakistani batting, with only Salim Malik putting up any resistance, though he ended up stranded on 82 despite useful support from Mushtaq Ahmed that spared the tourists' blushes (they added 64 for the ninth wicket).\nGooch (135) and Atherton (76) put the lie to any demons in the pitch though, with an opening stand of 168, and with Robin Smith (42) adding another century with Gooch for the second wicket, it looked like a walkover. Waqar decimated the lower order though, picking up five wickets as England slumped from 292/2 to 320 all out.\nIn the second innings, Ramiz blasted 63 as wickets fell around to leave Pakistan 96/4, and again Malik was the mainstay of the innings, making 84 before running out of partners for the second time. The England batsmen made rather hard work of their target of 99, Atherton, Smith and Stewart all falling in single figures, but Gooch and then Gower saw them to victory.\n5th Test.\nEngland won the toss and batted, and the upper order all made starts, but only Atherton converted that into a half-century, and from the relative security of 182/3, Wasim (6–67) and Aaqib (2–44) worked their magic as the middle order and tail again had no answer to the Pakistani pacemen. In reply, four Pakistanis made fifties, including wicketkeeper Rashid Latif on his debut, but none of them made the huge score they'd threatened. Malcolm picked up five wickets.\nEngland's second innings was anchored by Smith (84*), but around him the batting failed, collapsing to 59/4 before Smith, Ramprakash and Lewis steadied the innings, but eventually only able to muster 174. Waqar (5–52) was the principle destroyer, picking up the first four wickets and finishing it off by bowling Malcolm, and Wasim (3–36) again picked up the tail with little trouble. Sohail knocked off the runs from Ramprakash's first legitimate delivery."

Rain prevented play on the first day of the two-day match, but on the second day 40 wickets fell, and the South Africans (126 and 60) defeated MCC (103 and 72) by 11 runs.

Rowe led the bowlers, with 136 wickets at 12.87; his opening partner Middleton took 83 wickets at 15.79.\nAfter the tour, Simkins, the manager, declared that \"from a cricket point of view\" the tour was \"a far greater success than the most sanguine of our team and supporters anticipated\". However, financially it was \"as complete a failure as it could be\", and the tour's guarantors lost all their investment."

South Africa's quartet of bowlers, Reggie Schwarz, Aubrey Faulkner, Bert Vogler and Gordon White were praised for the quality of their googly bowling, and two of the four—Schwarz and Vogler—were recognised as \"Wisden\" Cricketers of the Year the following year.\nAlthough the tour was the fourth the South Africans had made to England, it was the first to include Test matches; England won the three-match series 1–0. Across the whole tour, South Africa won 21 of their 31 matches and drew many plaudits.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nBatting first, England batted for the whole of the first day to reach their total of 428. Len Braund was the top-scorer for the hosts, scoring 104 with \"the utmost patience and judgement\", while Gilbert Jessop scored a quick 93 runs late in the day. \"Wisden\" identified Bert Vogler, who took seven wickets, as the best of the bowlers, spinning the ball in both directions and varying his pace effectively. In their reply, only two of the South African batsmen made significant scores—Dave Nourse and Aubrey Faulkner—no other players reached double figures. In a three-day match, Foster asked the South Africans to follow on, as they still trailed by 288 runs at the close of the first innings, but they recovered and batted with more resolve in their second innings. Led by their captain, Percy Sherwell, who scored 115 runs, South Africa finished the second day on 185 for 3, still trailing England by 103 runs. On the third day, it began raining just as the umpires were walking out onto the pitch in the morning, and got heavier later, making it impossible to play any cricket, and the match was accordingly drawn. On each of the first two days over 17,000 people attended the match.\n2nd Test.\nEngland once again won the toss and chose to bat in the second Test, but in contrast to the first match, they made few runs. Only three batsmen reached double figures—Tom Hayward, Johnny Tyldesley and George Hirst—as Faulkner took six wickets for the tourists, getting prodigious turn in both directions with his spin bowling. The pitch was soft and difficult to bat on due to the rain, and after lunch nine of England's wickets were lost in under an hour. England were weakened due to their decision to pick a pace bowler, Neville Knox, over a spinner, Jack Crawford, who would have been better suited to the conditions. Accordingly, England relied on Colin Blythe, who bowled for the entire innings and collected eight wickets. Nevertheless, partially due to a number of dropped catches, South Africa scored 110 to lead by 34 runs.\nEngland began their second innings on the evening of the first day, and had reached 25 runs without loss by the close. On the second day, rain showers in the morning meant that the players were on and off the pitch a number of times, and no play was possible at all after lunch, by which time the score had moved on to 110 for 4, of which C. B. Fry had scored 54. Rain continued to disrupt play on the third day, and the condition of the pitch made batting extremely difficult; England only scored 52 more runs, leaving South Africa needing 129 runs to win. The South Africans lost wickets quickly and regularly on the final day, being at one stage 18 for 5. Despite a good partnership between Faulkner and Tip Snooke, they were all out for 75, granting England victory by 53 runs. Blythe once again bowled for the entire innings, collecting another seven wickets, giving him match figures of 15 for 99.\n3rd Test.\n\"Wisden\" identified the third Test as featuring the best cricket of the three matches, partially due to the better weather. For the third time, England won the toss and batted, and were led by a century from Fry and a half-century from the captain, R. E. Foster. Although England made a respectable total, their batting was criticised for being inconsistent, and the South African bowling praised as being difficult. Due to rain breaks, England batted until the middle of the afternoon on the second day to reach their 295. When South Africa came in to bat, the conditions were difficult as the pitch was drying, but partially due to some inaccurate bowling from Blythe, the batsmen were able to score runs. Tip Snooke top-scored with 63 runs, while Nourse, Jimmy Sinclair and William Shalders all scored twenty or more. Blythe bowled far better on the final morning to dismiss South Africa for 178, leaving England a 117-run lead.\nEngland lost three early wickets in their second innings, but their middle order rallied, and they reached 138, despite both Schwarz and Vogler getting a lot of movement with their bowling. South Africa needed 256 runs in two hours and forty minutes to secure an unlikely victory. Their captain, Sherwell, announced that they would give it a go, and the opening batsmen, Sinclair and Faulkner began well, moving the score to 61 runs after 35 minutes. Three wickets from Hirst restricted the South Africans, but further attacking batting from the South Africans entertained the crowds until the match was stopped due to poor light, resulting in a draw."

England won the series 3–2 with no matches drawn.\nSouth African team.\nThe South African team was captained by Jack Cheetham, with Jackie McGlew as vice-captain. Ken Viljoen, the former Test cricketer, was the manager. The combination of Cheetham and Viljoen had led South Africa to its most successful tour of Australia ever, the 1952-53 tour, when the team drew the series with Australia. Arguably the side's performance in England was even better, since the hosts were recognised at the time as the strongest team in Test cricket, having beaten Australia both home and away and drawn with West Indies away during the previous two years. Jack Cheetham's team were one of the outstanding fielding sides in the history of cricket and remained the benchmark for fieldsmen for decades. In the first One Day International in 1970-71 Richard Whitington wrote \"out-fieldsmen were hurling themselves about along the fence in a manner I had not seen for years in desperate endeavour to save fours and reduce runs. They were beginning to resemble Jack Cheetham's unforgettable 1952-53 Springboks\". Frank Tyson added in the 1974–75 Ashes series \"Never have I seen a better fielding display in a Test match since Jack Cheetham's 1955 Springboks. Almost everything that left the ground was caught...\"\nThe full team was:\nCheetham, McGlew, Endean, Mansell, McLean, Tayfield and Waite had toured England with the 1951 team. Smith had toured England with the 1947 team, but had not been selected in 1951; he was the only remaining player who had been to England on that tour. McGlew, Adcock, Duckworth, Goddard, McLean, Tayfield and Waite would return to England with the 1960 team. Before this tour in 1955, only Duckworth, Goddard and Heine had not played Test cricket, and Goddard and Heine made their Test debuts during the 1955 series. Duckworth, who subsequently played two Tests in 1957, and Murray, who had played 10 Tests before this tour, were the only players not selected for a Test on this tour.\nTest series summary.\nFirst Test.\nWith Leonard Hutton unable to play because of lumbago, Peter May captained England for the first time. A new opening pair of Don Kenyon and Tom Graveney started with 91 and Kenyon went on to make 87. May made 83, but Ken Barrington on his Test debut, lasted only three balls. England's innings took nine hours, but South Africa's batting was even slower. After five wickets had fallen for 55 runs, McGlew, whose 68 took 305 minutes, and Cheetham (54) put on 94 in three hours. But Johnny Wardle finished the innings with four wickets for 24 runs in 32 overs. May enforced the follow-on, but McGlew (51) and Goddard (32) survived to the end of the third day and beyond a delayed start on the Monday. Then with fast bowlers unable to bowl from one end because of dampness, Frank Tyson and Trevor Bailey took eight out the 10 wickets from the other, Tyson finishing with figures of six for 28.\nSecond Test.\nA fast pitch produced a match that was exciting throughout. England won the toss and batted, but Heine, on his Test debut, made the ball lift awkwardly and took five wickets for 60 runs. Goddard supported well with 4/59. McGlew and Goddard both went for ducks, but after tea on the first day the pitch lost its spitefulness. Endean started the recovery with 48, and then McLean hit 142 out of 196 in just over three-and-a-half hours. Keith, batting more sedately, added 109 for the sixth wicket with McLean and went on to 57 himself. Facing a deficit of 171, England lost Kenyon quickly, Graveney (60) added 132 with May, who then added a further 96 with Denis Compton (69). May made 112 before he trod on his wicket. Tayfield was South Africa's most successful bowler with five for 80. Brian Statham removed both openers before the end of the third day, and a ball bowled by Fred Trueman hit Cheetham on the elbow and chipped a bone, so he retired hurt. On the Monday, aided by a two-hour break for bad light, Statham bowled throughout the innings, taking the first seven wickets to fall and finishing with seven for 39.\nThird Test.\nWith Cheetham injured McGlew assumed the captaincy and effected England's first defeat at Old Trafford since 1902, this achieved with three minutes to spare. Another lively pitch brought a decent scoring rate and several injuries: Godfrey Evans broke a finger and Graveney kept wicket in South Africa's second innings. England's first innings owed almost everything to Compton, who having forgotten his kitbag, sauntered into the Museum and borrowed an antique bat off the display, made 158 and shared a fifth wicket stand of 144 with Trevor Bailey, who made 44. McGlew and Goddard (62) shared an opening partnership of 147, but after Goddard was out, McGlew became another finger injury casualty and four further wickets fell cheaply. Waite and Winslow then came together and shared a sixth wicket partnership of 171. Both made centuries: Waite 113 and Winslow 108. When McGlew resumed his innings at the fall of the seventh wicket, he became the third century-maker with an unbeaten 104. England lost openers Kenyon and Graveney for just a run apiece. Then May, with 117, shared century stands with Compton (71) and Colin Cowdrey (50). The injured Evans made 36 of a last-wicket partnership of 48 with Bailey, but South Africa needed 145 to win in 135 minutes. McGlew and McLean hit 72 in 50 minutes, and though wickets fell regularly after that, the target was achieved in what would have been the penultimate over.\nFourth Test.\nSouth Africa lost half their first innings wickets for 38 and were then 98 for seven. Innings of 41 apiece by McLean and Endean gave the total some respectability; Peter Loader took four wickets for 52 runs. England's new opening pair of Trevor Bailey and Frank Lowson failed, and only May with 47 and Compton (61) made runs against an attack depleted by injury to Adcock. Just 20 behind on the first innings, South Africa's openers, McGlew and Goddard, opened with a careful stand of 176, the highest first-wicket partnership against England to this point. Goddard went for 74, but McGlew completed a century, falling eventually for 133. Keith made 73, and after a mid-innings collapse Endean, with 116, shepherded the lower order batsmen to a total of 500. Graveney opened with Lowson as England sought 481 in eight hours and 20 minutes, but Lowson was out without scoring. Graveney made 36 and then May (97) and Doug Insole (47) put on 101 for the third wicket. The rest of the batting was worn down by Goddard and Tayfield, both of whom finished with five wickets in the innings. Goddard bowled 62 overs in all, bowling continuously on the last day from 11.30 in the morning until victory at 4.12 in the afternoon.\nFifth Test.\nPrior to the start of the game there was a lengthy South African Selection Committee debate as to who should captain the team, Cheetham opting for McGlew following his victories in the Third and Fourth encounters, McGlew disagreeing and so it was that Cheetham led the side out onto the Oval that Saturday in humid conditions, conditions which initially assisted the South African seam bowlers Heine and Fuller, however they bowled too long, the Englishmen masterful in reaping the error. Rain set in from early afternoon and the pitch when play resumed on the Monday was soft. Goddard's left-arm bowling brought him five wickets for 31, but when South Africa batted, it was the spin bowlers Tony Lock and Jim Laker who caused most damage, and only McGlew (30) and Waite (28) resisted for long. England's second innings was built around a defiant unbeaten 89 by May who shared useful partnerships with Compton and Graveney. Tayfield bowled 52 consecutive overs and took five for 60. South Africa needed 244 to win, and the match was effectively lost in the course of three overs from Lock and Laker in which the opening partnership between McGlew and Goddard was broken, and then the next three batsmen, Keith, Endean and McLean, failed to score. Waite made 60 as the other batsmen disappointed. Lock finished with four for 62, with Laker taking five for 56, and the match was over on the fourth day."

        "title": "South African cricket team in England in 1994",
        "text": "The South African cricket team toured England during the 1994 season. This was their first tour to England after the apartheid-inspired international sporting ban was rescinded. The team was led by Eastern Province's Kepler Wessels, who had returned to his native country after playing 24 Tests for Australia during the International ban years.\nSouth Africa had made a promising start to their International return, drawing their two most recent series, home and away against Australia, and some talents had begun to emerge already. Allan Donald was already well known to English spectators from his extended and successful spell as Warwickshire's overseas player from 1987 onwards, and had spearheaded the South African attack with 63 Test wickets prior to this series, and Fanie de Villiers made a useful foil, having taken 22 wickets against the Australians, including 6−43 in the victory at Sydney. Andrew Hudson had emerged as a superb opener, racking up centuries against the West Indies and Australia and nine fifties in his short career. Jonty Rhodes had established himself as one of the top fielders in the world already, and had won over doubters of his batting with a never-say-die attitude, which characterised the whole team, even where outright ability was lacking.\nEngland had just completed a victorious series against New Zealand, but seemed flattered by the tourists reliance on a couple of key players. The South Africans would provide a much more useful yardstick of Ray Illingworth's management of the team, and there were still doubts over middle order batsmen Robin Smith and Graeme Hick and the strength of the bowling, despite Phillip DeFreitas's re-emergence. New caps Darren Gough and Craig White had looked promising against New Zealand, but had yet to be seriously tested.\nThe Test series was drawn 1−1, with South Africa starting very well and dominating the First Test before England recovered to level the series on the back of somewhat improved batting and the raw pace of Devon Malcolm, whose 9/57 in the second innings at The Oval earned him the nickname of \"The Destroyer\" in South Africa. The One-Day series was won more comfortably by the hosts, 2−0. The tourists' victory in the First Test was somewhat overshadowed by the controversy over ball tampering by England captain Michael Atherton, who was seen taking dirt from his pocket while fielding and using it to dry the ball.\nHistorical significance.\nThis was an historic time for South African sport as the national sporting teams made their way back into the International arena, and reminded viewers around the world of the country's sporting pedigree. The International Cricket Council (ICC) re-admitted South Africa to world cricket in July 1991, after 21 years during which the only significant exposure to South African cricket had been through \"rebel\" tours.\nThis was the cricket team's first tour to England since 1965, and tour manager Fritz Bing summed up the visitors' mood on arrival, noting that they returned to \"the Mother Country not as rebels, beggars, or enemies, but as confident, happy children...we come proudly through the front door\". Although there were no black cricketers in this tour party, the team enjoyed overwhelming support back home, with Jonty Rhodes being identified as a new hero among young black cricketers in South Africa.\nSouth Africa's deputy president, Thabo Mbeki, flew to London for the First Test, and Dr Ali Bacher was feted at a Lord's Taverners dinner on the eve of the Test, where he gave a speech outlining the development plan for cricket in South Africa's townships.\nDespite all the media attention, Wessels was keen to keep the focus on cricket, rather than politics. \"We're a more confident side now, though,\" he said the day before the First Test, \"and no longer regard ourselves as newcomers. We have to look past the emotion of the occasion, but we have been involved in a few special occasions since our return to the\nfold, so we should be getting used to it by now.\"\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nSouth Africa went into the historic match with four front-line seamers and no spinner, selecting the same side that had drawn their last test, with Australia. England made two changes from the drawn test with New Zealand, John Crawley coming into the side to make his debut at the expense of Robin Smith and Ian Salisbury replacing Peter Such as the side's spinner.\nSouth Africa on the toss and opted to bat first on a flat-looking Lord's pitch, but after seeing off the initial burst from Phillip DeFreitas, Andrew Hudson fell to Darren Gough, and Hansie Cronje followed soon after to Angus Fraser. From 35/2, the tourists looked in a little trouble, but Gary Kirsten and captain Kepler Wessels (105) dug in and built obdurate innings, adding 106 before Kirsten (72) holed out to DeFreitas off Graeme Hick's bowling. Peter Kirsten was another Gough victim, caught behind by Steven Rhodes, and although Jonty Rhodes put on 75 with his skipper, both fell just before the close, leaving the honours relatively even at 244/6. Wessels' century was compiled in just under six hours and comprised 15 fours.\nThe second morning saw the South African lower order take the attack to the England bowlers, adding over a hundred for the last four wickets. Craig Matthews was the principal architect, striking 41 in just 36 balls. England's response started briskly, but not very successfully. Alec Stewart and captain Mike Atherton fell to the pace of Allan Donald, while Crawley edged Fanie De Villiers' swing to second slip. Hick and Graham Gooch consolidated, but both were dismissed in De Villiers' second spell and the rest of the lower-middle order followed quickly on the second evening. DeFreitas and then Gough dragged the score past the follow-on target, but couldn't inspire England to any heroics. Donald wrapped up both to finish with five wickets, diving forward to take a return catch to get rid of Gough, while Fraser was run out by Gary Kirsten trying to run a third, leaving Salisbury stranded having added just six in almost an hour.\nSouth Africa lost Hudson early again in the second innings, but Cronje and Gary Kirsten made a solid start to the innings, though the third afternoon was something of a grind, the visitors adding just 62 and losing the two set batsmen. Hick and Salisbury both enjoyed significant turn, if fairly little success, picking up just one wicket each in the innings, but they bowled tidily and economically, with Hick eventually tempting a frustrated Gary Kirsten down the wicket, only to beat the edge and Steven Rhodes took a neat stumping. Salisbury picked up the captain's wicket just after tea, but Peter Kirsten (42) and Jonty Rhodes saw the team safely to the close. These two, and then when Gough ripped them out, Brian McMillan (39*) and Matthews, pushed the lead quickly up to 450 before Wessels declared when Matthews was out, leaving his bowlers five sessions to win the match.\nIt did not take that long - England's second innings lasted just under 46 overs. Atherton and Stewart saw off Donald's opening spell, but then fell to De Villiers and the two back-up seamers. Stewart managed to hold out for two hours for his 27, but Matthews took two wickets in two balls, and despite Gooch passing Viv Richards as the fourth-highest Test run scorer during his 28, nobody had answers to South Africa's bowlers. The fielding was kept tight, and each of the bowlers chipped in with wickets as the batting collapsed and the tourists marched to a dominant victory.\nDuring the Test, former South African opening batsman Barry Richards bemoaned the lack of fight in the England team, commenting that \"...it puzzles me why the new breed of England batsmen are failing to stamp their authority on an innings. People like Stewart and Hick have all the ability at Test level but they do not seem to want to grab the game by the scruff of its neck and say to the opposition bowlers: 'I'm here. Come and get me if you can.'\". meanwhile, in \"The Guardian\", Mike Selvey praised the South African seamers, and Scyld Berry singled out Fanie De Villiers' bowling on the second day as the turning point of the match, and the above commentators pointed out England's lack of success at the home of cricket and questioned the lack of a left-handed batsman in the eleven.\nThe England captain described his team's performance as \"the worst under my captaincy\".\nThe \"dirt in pocket\" controversy.\nOn the third day of the First Test, television footage showed England captain Mike Atherton apparently removing some substance from his pocket and rubbing it onto the ball, which could be construed as ball tampering. Atherton was summoned to see the Match Referee, Peter Burge, after play had finished for the day, and gave his explanation, which included a denial that he had used any substance to alter the condition of the ball at any time in his career.\nWhen it later emerged that Atherton had dirt in his pocket that he had used to keep his fingers dry, Atherton recalled the conversation with the Match Referee thus:\n\"I did take my trousers to the meeting,\" he explained [in the press conference]. \"He asked me if I had resin in my pocket;\nI replied 'no'. He asked me if there had been any other substance; I replied 'no'. That is where I made my mistake. I was thinking of other substances such as iron filings or Lipsyl. There was absolutely no other substance [apart from earth] in my pocket.\"\nAtherton was fined £2,000 by Chairman of Selectors Ray Illingworth for not being totally frank with the Match Referee, but retained the captaincy despite calls from some quarters for him to step down or be sacked, with Pakistan manager Intikhab Alam particularly vociferous on the topic, telling \"The Sun\" newspaper \"Atherton\nhas been caught red-handed. He has to be replaced. What more evidence do people want? It's just not acceptable behaviour from somebody who is supposed to be the leader of the team\", while \"The Sun\" also published pictures that seemed to show Allan Donald lifting the seam of the ball.\n2nd Test.\nSouth Africa named the same side for the Second Test that had been so dominant in the First, while England made two changes: Graham Thorpe came in for all-rounder Craig White and Phil Tufnell replaced Salisbury as the specialist spinner. Fraser and Gough both recovered from knocks on the hand suffered while batting in the First Test and retained their places. England won the toss and batted first on what turned out to be a slowish pitch.\nGooch returned to the top of the order for this Test, but made only 23 before becoming the first of De Villiers' three victims, caught at slip by McMillan. Hick batted with confidence, but fell to the same combination for 25. Meanwhile, Atherton batted serenely, and was joined by Thorpe. These two added a superb 142 in just under three hours, punishing the more wayward attack whenever they strayed from a good line. Thorpe took the aggressor's role, striking 13 boundaries in his 72, but perished playing a lazy drive, and Jonty Rhodes took an easy catch at point. Atherton fell soon after, having batted for over five hours, and just missed out on his century, gifting a return catch to McMillan for a defiant 99 (nine fours and one six) that had allowed the other top order batsmen to play around him.\nCrawley (38) and Stewart (89) added a century stand of their own on the second morning, while the South African bowlers strove for the breakthrough in vain. Allan Donald was used in short bursts, as he was struggling with a toe injury, and it was just before lunch that Crawley was finally dismissed, having played a great supporting role. Steve Rhodes (65*) also contributed well, and shepherded the tail to a good position, adding 53 with Gough, and allowing Atherton to declare the innings and have nine overs at the tourists' openers. Hudson was again out cheaply, caught by the captain off Gough, before the close.\nThe third morning was very much England's - DeFreitas picked up Gary Kirsten, caught behind, and then Cronje, bowled first ball, in the first over of the day, and Wessels was dropped twice before he settled in and helped nightwatchman Dave Richardson (48) add sixty. The bounce was rather variable at this stage of the match, with several deliveries scuttling through rather low, and these two both went before lunch to Fraser, leaving South Africa at 105/5. The rest of the day belonged to the visitors though. Peter Kirsten struck up intelligent partnerships with Rhodes (46) and McMillan, and brought up his maiden Test century (104 from 226 balls, 13 boundaries) shortly before the close, only to be dismissed by DeFreitas soon afterwards. McMillan (78) continued the onslaught the next morning, adding another 77 with Matthews (62*), and the tail helped to raise the South African total to 447.\nThe tourists' hopes of pulling off another victory took a blow when it was revealed that Donald would not be able to bowl in the second innings because of his injury, but De Villiers and Matthews kept things very tight early on, after the experiment of opening with McMillan went awry, and under the pressure of scoring quickly to set a target Atherton and Gooch were both early victims. Thorpe and Hick batted through to the close with few further alarms. The final morning saw England start cautiously, but gradually increase their rate, until by the end they were pushing at more than six an over. Hick (110, nine fours, three sixes) accelerated from 50 to his century with ease, while Thorpe made 73 in good time, and Stewart 36 at a run a ball, allowing England to declare at lunch, setting the South Africans 298 to win. Hudson's fourth consecutive failure gave the home team hope that they might prompt a collapse, but the visitors declined to press for the runs, and crawled to 116/3 from the 60 overs that were bowled before the captains agreed to a draw, half an hour before the scheduled close. Tufnell picked up two wickets, while DeFreitas got the unlucky Gary Kirsten, whose bat was nowhere near the ball when adjudged caught behind. This was the first drawn Test at Headingley since 1980.\n3rd Test.\nSouth Africa dropped Hudson for the Final Test after his run of low scores and Peter Kirsten moved up to open the batting with his brother, while Daryll Cullinan came into the middle order. Donald recovered from his sore toe to lead the bowling attack. Fraser and Tufnell were left out of the England side from the Second Test, with Devon Malcolm coming in to make use of the pace of the pitch and Surrey's Joey Benjamin making his Test debut in an all-seam attack. The selectors no doubt hoped he could use his knowledge of conditions at The Oval to supplement his fast-medium pace.\nSouth Africa won the toss and took first use of the traditionally-quick track, but looked in terrible trouble when the Kirstens fell to DeFreitas (4-93) and Malcolm early on, and then, after Cronje (38) and Wessels (45) had steadied the ship a little, Benjamin (4-42) had Cronje adjudged in front and Cullinan edged a DeFreitas delivery to a gleeful Steven Rhodes.\nJonty Rhodes added to the South Africans' worries when he ducked into a short ball from Malcolm and had to retire hurt, while Wessels became Benjamin's second leg before victim, leaving the tourists 136/5 and a man short. McMillan and Richardson (58) took the attack back to the England bowlers in the second half of the day, adding a vital 124 before Richardson edged Benjamin to Rhodes, and Matthews uncharacteristically failed, diverting one to Hick at slip without scoring. McMillan and Donald took South Africa safely to the close, but the former added just two to his overnight total to be ninth man out for a rumbustious 93, and Rhodes didn't return to bat.\nEngland's innings started badly, with Atherton departing to De Villiers' first delivery and showing a degree of dissent about the lbw decision that cost him half his match fee as a fine. Gooch was kept bogged down by the seamers and was dismissed by Donald soon after lunch for a paltry 8, having scrabbled around for about an hour. Hick (39) started well, but succumbed to a leg-stump yorker from Donald, but Thorpe and Stewart counter-attacked, adding 52 for the fourth wicket before Matthews bowled Thorpe for 79. Crawley lasted just 12 balls before becoming another of Donald's victims, and Rhodes provided Stewart (62) with good support, but both were dismissed late in the day by De Villiers. DeFreitas (37) and Gough (42*) added quick-fire runs at the end of the day, before DeFreitas was run out early on the third morning, and De Villiers (4-42) and Matthews mopped up the tail.\nHaving received a short ball to the helmet from De Villiers during his brief innings, Devon Malcolm came out to bowl all fired up, allegedly having told De Villiers \"You guys are history!\", He demolished the South African batting. He ripped out Peter and Gary Kirsten and Hansie Cronje before the tourists had a chance to draw breath, leaving them 1/3. Wessels and Cullinan stabilised the innings, but the captain was next to go, also to Malcolm, and Cullinan's approach seemed to be to attack anything he could - as the only batsman capable of fending Malcolm off, his innings of 94 (134 balls, 12 boundaries) was immense, and with DeFreitas bowling niggardly spells whenever Malcolm had to rest, the South Africans had no respite. Meanwhile, McMillan (25), Richardson and Matthews all fell to Malcolm quickly, and although Jonty Rhodes came in to bat at number nine, no one else could stem the tide of wickets. Cullinan eventually went to Gough, and Malcolm cleaned up Rhodes and Donald, to finish with figures of 9 for 57, the fourth best Test bowling analysis by an England bowler.\nEngland's batsmen set about their target of 204 with great relish, adding 107 from the 16 overs remaining on the third evening. Atherton (63) batted steadily but robustly, allowing those around him to score freely. Gooch (33 from 20 balls) was the only wicket to fall, and the following morning, they continued in the same vein. Hick made 81 at a run a ball, and Thorpe rounded things off with a quick-fire 15, driving down the ground for four to seal the victory, after Atherton edged one to Richardson with 24 required to win.\nSeries summary.\nEngland.\nThe momentum in this tour swung decisively in England's favour only in the Third Test with Devon Malcolm's fiery burst of quick bowling, although hints of a recovery were clear in the Second Test, with Atherton, Stewart, Rhodes, Thorpe and Hick all showing signs of confidence. Malcolm's impact was evidenced by his selection of England's man of the series despite playing only the one Test.\nFour of the batsmen picked up 200 runs or more (Thorpe, Hick, Stewart, Atherton), while Fraser, Gough and DeFreitas all contributed with the ball sufficiently to augur well for the forthcoming Ashes series. Rhodes looked secure behind the stumps and showed resilience with the bat.\nSouth Africa.\nThe South Africans will be concerned that they managed to let the series victory slide away from them after such a superb performance in the First Test. They had no answer for Malcolm's pace in the final innings of the series and there will be questions asked about their capitulation.\nChristopher Martin-Jenkins noted in \"The Times\" that the tourists were \"too dependent on their fast-medium bowling\" and that the batting would look a little shaky when Wessels retires, given the performances of Hudson and Cronje, though he praised Darryl Cullinan's emergence as \"a batsman of genuine Test class\".\nOnly McMillan and Wessels made 200 runs, though Cullinan showed vigour in compiling 101 in the Third Test, but the pace quartet all contributed at times, De Villiers and Donald each picking up 12 wickets in the series.\nExternal sources.\nCricketArchive"

Played in a round-robin format, all three teams played each other once, with the top two teams going through to a head-to-head final to decide the winner.\nGroup stage.\nTable key.\nP = Games played\nW = Games won\nL = Games lost\nNR = Games with no result\nT = Games tied\nNRR = Net run rate\nPoints system.\nWon = 2 points\nLost = 0 points\nTie or No result = 1 point\nStandard net run rate rules applied.\nPosition deciders.\nThe deciding factors, in order, on table position were:\nBecause England and Sri Lanka had the best run rates, they were ranked as the top two teams. England beat Sri Lanka and finished top of the group. South Africa's run rate meant they missed out on the final, despite having beaten England, and that a better run rate than Sri Lanka would have put them top of the table.\nTest series.\nOnly Test.\nRecords.\nMuttiah Muralitharan claimed what was, at the time, a career best 9/65 in the second innings – a record he has only bettered on one occasion, against Zimbabwe in 2002 – and was the 8th best bowling in a Test match innings at the time, but has slipped one place to 9th. The 16/220 claimed in the match is the 5th best bowling record in a match, a position it has stood in since the match.\nJohn Crawley also claimed a Test career best of 156 not out. The match was the last England Test to be broadcast live by BBC Television in the UK, with Channel 4 and Sky screening the 1999 New Zealand tour of England."

        "title": "West Indian cricket team in England in 1900",
        "text": "The West Indian cricket team toured England in the 1900 season. The team played 17 matches between 11 June and 11 August 1900.\nThere had been three tours by teams of English Amateurs to the West Indies in the mid-1890s and the idea of sending a combined West Indies team to England had gradually developed. Several of the leading West Indies players were unavailable and the team that eventually sailed for England was a little weaker than had been anticipated. Despite the fact that it was known that earlier English touring sides had been of very modest standard, the opponents that were arranged for the 1900 tourists were in general of too high a standard, with 12 of the 17 being of first-class standard. The result was that the West Indians suffered a series of heavy defeats in the early games, a situation not helped by them losing the toss of most occasions. Eventually, because of a combination of the tourists improving and the opponents fielding much weaker sides, the games became much more competitive and by the end of the tour 5 matches had been won compared to 8 losses. The post-tour comments were that the tour had been, \"as an experiment\", successful. In reality the early defeats had meant that the general interest in the tour was very limited.\nAucher Warner, who was Plum Warner's brother was the official captain of the team but he played in only 7 matches because of Malarial Fever, losing the toss on all 7 occasions. The two black Professionals, Float Woods and Tommie Burton, did much of the bowling. The batting honours were shared with Charles Ollivierre, Lebrun Constantine, Percy Cox and Percy Goodman being the most successful. The lack of a genuine wicket-keeper, the poor running between the wickets and the weakness of the fielding were widely commented on.\nTouring team.\nThere had been an idea for a tour to England for some time and following the twin tours of Lord Hawke and Priestley to the West Indies in 1896–97. This idea was further developed and in June 1899 a combined West Indian eleven was invited to visit England. Lord Hawke was the chairperson of the Sports Committee of the West Indian Club and sent out an invitation in their name. The response was favourable, so he then arranged a series of matches for the summer of 1900. The initial selection of the West Indies team took place after the 1899–1900 Inter-Colonial Tournament in January 1900.\nThe 15 players that eventually made up the team consisted of:\nBurton and Woods were regarded as Professionals. W. C. Nock of Trinidad was the manager. Sproston acted as captain in the absence of Aucher Warner. P.F. Warner played in 1 match. R.S.A. Warner and P.F. Warner were brothers. It appears that the wicket-keeping was shared between Constantine and Learmond.\n\"Cricket\" gives what is presumably the original list of 14 selections and 4 reserves. The selections includes H.A. Cole (Barbados) and G.B.Y. Cox (Barbados). Of the reserves P.I. Cox and Livingston made the final team, the other reserves being W.E. Goodman (British Guiana) and F.L. Pearce (Jamaica). R.S.A. Warner is not mentioned.\n\"Cricket\" has an anonymous letter giving further details following a meeting in Barbados on 17 April. A letter had been received from British Guiana indicating that Sproston was unable to accompany the team, although this eventually turned out not to be the case. A letter was received from Jamaica suggesting that Livingston should go in Cole's place, this being agreed to. Further a letter was received from Mr. Aucher Warner offering his services as captain in accordance with the West Indies Cricket Committee in London. This offer was accepted and Bowring the original captain was to tour as an ordinary member. The team given also excludes P.I. Cox who did eventually take part in the tour.\nH.B.G. Austin was unable to tour as he was fighting in South Africa.\nThe majority of the team was white. Burton and Woods were, of course, black as were Constantine, Hinds and Ollivierre amongst the Amateurs.\nPreliminaries.\nThe Trinidad contingent sailed from Port of Spain on 24 May on R.M.S. Eden where they met the other tourists. On the day of their departure they were entertained at luncheon at the Ice House by the Barbados Committee. They left Barbados on R.M.S. Trent on 26 May and after a record journey arrived in Southampton on 6 June.\nThe tourists had a few days practice on the Hampshire ground and then travelled up to London to start their first match on 11 June.\nMatches.\nStatus.\nThe M.C.C. ruled that none of the matches were first-class. \"It was perhaps, a pity that it was deemed advisable not to consider the West Indian matches as first-class, but it is difficult to see how this could be avoided; for on the form shown during the early part of the tour, the team would have been hopelessly out of the running, while, when the turn of the tide came, it was far too late to make any changes\".\nOf the 17 matches, 10 were against teams in the County Championship and they also played London County and the M.C.C. who were also first-class teams at that time. The remaining 5 matches were against minor teams, three were Minor Counties and while one match was against a combined Minor Counties team this was not at all representative. Liverpool and District were not regarded as first-class at this time.\nMatch 1 v London County.\nWG Grace had collected together a strong side to meet the West Indians in their first match. The tourists made a bad start when Aucher Warner lost the toss and WG and James Gilman added 135 for the first wicket. Tommie Burton then dismissed both openers and with Float Woods bowling Len Braund cheaply the West Indians were in a better position. Jack Mason however then scored 126 in 125 minutes and with useful scoring by Albert Lawton they reached 432/8 at the close.\nA thunderstorm made the pitch easy for a while and Howard Parkes and Edward Berridge took the score to 538. The tourists were quickly 29/4 in reply with Charles Ollivierre being run out before Percy Goodman and Percy Cox added 113 together. Mason then took cheap wickets and left the side 176/8 at the close.\nOn the third day, Warner and Woods added 59 for the last wicket to take the total to 237. Following-on, they were dismissed for just 103 with Grace and Mason taking five wickets each. Ollivierre and Warner top scored with 20 each.\nMatch 2 v Worcestershire.\nBowring, Hinds and Kerr replaced D'Ade, Mignon and Warner. Sproston lost the toss and Worcestershire, who had 9 professionals in the team, batted and scored 307 in about 4 hours with Harry Foster top scoring with 79. Float Woods took 5/77 but otherwise the bowling was ineffective. The tourists made a poor start in reply and were 85/6 at the end of the first day with Frederick Pearson taking 4 cheap wickets. Pearson was only 19 and still qualifying for Worcestershire and so was only available for non-Championship matches in 1900.\nRain had affected the pitch overnight and despite a useful stand of 74 between Stanley Sproston and Percy Cox the West Indians were dismissed for 187 with Pearson taking 6/73. Worcestershire then made 257 with Pearson top scoring with 88 not out and Charles Ollivierre taking 4/37. The visitors were 61/4 at the close.\nFitz Hinds and Sproston added useful runs on the third day but after they were out the match was over soon after lunch. Pearson, who took another 4 wickets to make his match figures 10/108 to go with 100 runs for once out, was the star of the match.\nMatch 3 v Warwickshire.\nWarner and Mignon returned to the side and Livingston made his debut. Burton was left out together with Constantine and Kerr. Warner lost the toss and by the end of the first day Warwickshire were 456/9 with Dick Lilley scoring 55 in an hour and John Hill scoring 145 in 200 minutes.\nOn the second day the Warwickshire team were soon dismissed for 456 which included 35 byes and 14 leg-byes. Tourists reached 233 with Charles Ollivierre and Percy Cox adding 109 useful runs for the second wicket. Cox top scored with 79. Both Percy Goodman and Gilbert Livingston were run out. Following-on they were dismissed cheaply for 122 on a showery third day.\nMatch 4 v Gentlemen of M.C.C..\nThe tourists left out Hinds, Kerr, Livingston and Mignon for their first match at Lord's. There was no play on the first day due to rain. Warner lost the toss and WG Grace and Andrew Stoddart opened the batting on the second day. The tourists had early success but an innings of 118 from Arthur Somerset and other useful performances by the tail gave the M.C.C. over 200 for the last 4 wickets and a good total.\nThe West Indies struggled in reply and were 190 all out, George Learmond making 52 and adding 75 in 30 minutes with Charles Ollivierre. WG took 5 wickets. Following-on they were again in trouble at 132/8 and heading for an innings defeat. However Lebrun Constantine scored a magnificent 113 in 90 minutes. Assisted by Tommie Burton they added 162 for the 9th wicket in 65 minutes. Burton eventually made 64* and left the M.C.C. a target of 107 in a little over 2 hours. Stoddart took 7 wickets, all clean bowled. The two Professionals bowled well to reduce the M.C.C. to 36/4 but they reached their target with 5 minutes to spare for the loss of only one further wicket.\nMatch 5 v Minor Counties.\nHinds, Kerr and Mignon replaced D'Ade, Goodman and Warner. The Minor Counties side was not at all representative and had 7 Northamptonshire players joined by Creber and Lowe from Glamorgan, Williams from Berkshire and Elliott from Durham. Sproston won the toss for the first time and the tourists made 206 with Charles Ollivierre making 69 in 2 hours. George Thompson took 7/84.\nIn reply the Minor Counties made 261 with Tommie Burton taking 6/55. Batting again the West Indians were in trouble but with 68 from Fitz Hinds and 30s from Percy Cox and William Bowring they set a target of 116. The Minor Counties were then dismissed for just 54 with Float Woods (4/31), Burton (3/11) and William Mignon (2/5) doing all the bowling and giving the tourists their first victory.\nMatch 6 v Gloucestershire.\nGoodman and Warner replaced Cox and Kerr. Gloucestershire won the toss and batted. The tourists had a good start taking 3 quick wickets but Stanley Brown scored a useful 60 and was out at 90/4. Charlie Townsend then joined Harry Wrathall and the pair added 209 for the fifth wicket, Gloucestershire then being 299/5. Gilbert Jessop then joined Townsend. Jessop reach his 50 in 20 minutes, 83 in 30, 102 in 43 and was out for 157 scored in an hour. He added 201 with Townsend in the hour taking the total to 500/6. His innings contain 29 4s. At this time a 6 was awarded only for hits out of the ground, so an unknown number of these 4s could have been modern-day 6s. Jessop hit Float Woods for five fours and a three in one over. Gloucestershire reached 518/7 at the close. Woods had strained himself in the previous match and could not bowl comfortably. In addition Tommie Burton damaged his foot at lunchtime and didn't bowl for the rest of the day.\nOn the second day Gloucestershire were all out for 619. Burton's figures of 5/68 in 25 overs look impressive but he had taken 3 wickets before lunch on the first day and took 2 tail-enders wickets on the second day and had not bowled when the runs were being piled on. William Mignon took 5/162, dismissing Wrathall, Townsend and Jessop, but Charles Ollivierre with 0/137 and Woods with 0/141 really suffered. Fitz Hinds did no better with 0/72 in just 8 overs.\nWhen they batted the tourists collapsed for 98 with Percy Goodman run out for 38, Townsend and Frederick Roberts taking the wickets. Following-on they did much better. Lebrun Constantine top scored with 65 and 10 of the team reached double figures to give a respectable total of 307 reached by noon on the third day.\nMatch 7 v Leicestershire.\nPlum Warner played for West Indians in this match. He and Cox replaced Aucher Warner and Bowring. Sproston won the toss and Plum Warner and Charles Ollivierre then added 238 for the first wicket in 135 minutes, Warner made 113 and Ollivierre was eventually run out for 159 scored in 190 minutes. The day ended with the score at 307/4.\nLebrun Constantine scored a useful 41 on the second day to take the score to 383. Leicestershire collapsed for 80 with Float Woods taking 5/39 and Tommie Burton 4/39. Following-on they did much better and were 210/5 at the close of the second day, Charles de Trafford having scored 51. When play started on the third day Cecil Wood was soon out for 77 and the match was soon over, Burton taking 4/63 in the innings.\nMatch 8 v Nottinghamshire.\nAucher Warner replaced his brother Plum in the side and the tourists had a three-day break before the match. Warner lost the toss again and the Nottinghamshire team scored 501 with William Gunn scoring 161 in 210 minutes out of 274. They were 343/4 at the close. On the second day James Iremonger scored 101. Tommie Burton took 5/159 in 73.3 overs in the innings.\nIn reply Percy Cox scored 55 but the West Indians were 124/6 at stumps. On the final day Aucher Warner reached 53* but the tourists followed-on 292 behind. In reply Stanley Sproston scored 72, Charles Ollivierre 50 and Lebrun Constantine 50*. Gunn took 7 wickets in the match with his lobs.\nMatch 9 v Wiltshire.\nBowring and Livingston were brought in for Learmond and Mignon. Warner lost the toss as usual and Wiltshire scored 313 and the tourists were 83/3 at the close with Lebrun Constantine scoring 43 in 20 minutes before being run out.\nOn the second day the tourists did badly and only got 37 more runs. William Overton took 7/35 in the innings. Following-on they did even worse, Constantine again being top score with 32. This was regarded as the worst performance of the tour.\nMatch 10 v Lancashire.\nLearmond and Mignon replaced Goodman and Livingston. Warner lost the toss but Lancashire were dismissed for 187 with William Mignon taking 6/44. Henry Cudworth, who only placed a single first-class match in his career, scored 102 in 2 hours. In reply the tourists scored 174 with Charles Ollivierre scoring 44. Johnny Briggs was rested and did not bowl.\nOn the second day Lancashire were bowled out for 182, Briggs scoring 64, AN Hornby being absent having been injured fielding on the first day. Mignon took 4 more wickets to make it 10/117 in the match. Set a target of 196 the West Indies were 109/4 but after Ollivierre was out for 60 they fell well short. Briggs was turned loose and took 7/43 in the innings.\nMatch 11 v Derbyshire.\nD'Ade and Goodman replaced Learmond and Warner. Derbyshire won the toss and scored 234. Tommie Burton with 4/78 and Percy Cox with 5/61 doing the damage. The West Indies were 38/1 at stumps.\nOn the second day the tourists passed the Derbyshire total but a thunderstorm caused two and a quarter hours of play to be lost at the end of the day. Lebrun Constantine and Percy Goodman had added 103 for the fifth wicket in just over an hour. Goodman eventually made 104* in a little over 2 hours. John Hulme did most of the damage taking 6/77. Derbyshire were 74/5 but recovered to score 182/7 before declaring leaving the tourists just 11 overs in which they reached 45/2. William Storer top scored in both innings for Derbyshire.\nMatch 12 v Staffordshire.\nKerr replaced Constantine. Staffordshire won the toss and scored 256 with Albert Hollowood scoring 103 in 3 hours. Tommie Burton took 7/100 in 42 overs. The West Indies were 42/1 at the close.\nOn the second day the tourists reached 228 with Fitz Hinds making 79. With only two days allocated the match was always likely to be drawn.\nMatch 13 v Hampshire.\nLearmond replaced Kerr. Sproston won the toss and scored 366/9 on the first day Percy Cox and Percy Goodman adding 105 for the second wicket. Stanley Sproston top scored with 86 and William Bowring also contributed 63 useful runs. Charles Llewellyn bowled 54 overs in the innings taking 7/153.\nThunderstorms on the second day stopped play for three hours with Hampshire on 101/2 and only Victor Barton with 59 and Llewellyn with 93 had much success on a poor pitch. Float Woods took 6/93. The tourists were 20/0 at the close. The wicket was still poor on the third day and Llewellyn was again successful taking 6/34. Hampshire had little chance of victory and the two Professionals soon dispatched them, Woods taking 4/55 and Tommie Burton 5/50. The tourists had the best of the conditions for a change.\nMatch 14 v Surrey.\nConstantine replaced Learmond. Sproston won the toss and the tourists batted. Charles Ollivierre and Percy Cox opened the batting and were not parted until Ollivierre was caught at square leg for 94 off Livingstone Walker, the score standing at 208. Cox was eventually out for 142 scored out of 261. Walker was the seventh bowler used but had great success taking 8/72 in 15 overs. Percy Goodman scored 34* but otherwise the wickets fell rapidly and the score eventually reached only 328. When Surrey batted Float Woods was unplayable and the batting team were soon 30/6 with Woods at this stage having figures of 5/8. John Shuter and Walker led a short recovery and Surrey were 86/7 at the close.\nOn the second morning Surrey were dismissed for 117 with Woods taking 7/48 in 19 overs. Following-on Surrey made a good start but soon started losing wickets. Edward Dowson was run out for the second time in the match when going well and Walker again batted well. Woods took 5/68 to make it 12 wickets in the match. Tommie Burton took the remaining 6 wickets. This was regarded as the best victory of the tour.\nMatch 15 v Liverpool and District.\nThe tourists kept the same side and Sproston again won the toss and batted. Percy Cox scored 76 and Stanley Sproston scored 118 in 110 minutes, the two adding over 100 for the 5th wicket. William Mignon joined Sproston for the last wicket and despite making only 1* helped Sproston take his score from 64 to 118 and the West Indies to 265. Cecil Holden made 86 for Liverpool but Tommie Burton and Cox took 5 wickets each to give the tourists a first innings lead of 47. There had been no play at all on the second day.\nThere was only three and a half hours of play remaining when the tourists started their second innings which they declared closed at 124/5. Liverpool reached 100/0 at the close with Hubert Pilkington making 68* and Holden 23*.\nLebrun Constantine was given out in this match when a ball played by him lodged in his leg guard. The Liverpool wicket-keeper Arthur Kemble rushed up and picked the ball out and Constantine was initially given out. However the decision was then reversed, the law having changed in 1899, and he was allowed to continue his innings.\nMatch 16 v Yorkshire.\nLearmond replaced Mignon. Sproston lost the toss but play was limited to 25 minutes on the opening day. The match was abandoned on the second day.\nMatch 17 v Norfolk.\nKerr replaced Learmond. Norfolk won the toss and batted. Float Woods and Percy Cox had Norfolk in all sorts of trouble but they eventually reached 117. Woods had taken 5/38 and Cox 4/44. The tourists also stated badly but Lionel D'Ade rescued the situation with 68* to enable the tourists to gain a first innings lead of 48. D'Ade had taken 2 hours for his first 34. Charles Shore took 5/64 for Norfolk.\nWhen Norfolk batted again Burton was unplayable and took 8/9 in 10.4 overs including a spell of 5/0 in 5 overs. With Woods, who took 2/22 in 10 overs, they bowled unchanged and dismissed the county for just 32.\nSummary.\nOf the 17 matches played, 5 matches were won, 8 were lost and 4 were drawn.\nIt is worth noting that in the 7 matches he played in Aucher Warner lost the toss each time. On each occasion the West Indians had to field first and on each occasion they lost the match. Stanley Sproston had more luck, winning the toss 5 times out of 10.\nThe first 10 matches were all won by the team batting first and it was only in the very last match against Norfolk that the team batting second won a game.\nPost Tour.\nA banquet was held for the team at the West Indian Club. The team left Southampton on 23 August abroad R.M.S. Don, returning to the West Indies on about 4 September.\nGeneral Comments.\nThe following comments made after the tour are typical. \"A tour which, as an experiment, was extremely interesting and far more successful than might have been expected. As everyone thought at the time, the programme of matches arranged in December was too ambitious, but the defect was easily remedied, the leading counties putting far less than their full strength into the field when the West Indians had to be opposed.\". Plum Warner said \"I will begin 'right away' as the Americans say, by stating that the tour was a success. Considering that the team had never played together before, that they loss the toss on no fewer than twelve occasions out of the seventeen matches that the programme comprised, I think that the judgment I have given will be endorsed on all sides\".\nHe continues later: \"The weakest points of the team were: (1) The absence of a reliable wicket-keeper, and (2) The bad judgment that was too often displayed when running\".\n'Cricket' says that \"The members of the team, white and coloured alike, have proved themselves to be good sportsmen and keen opponents, while the very fact that they did not come over for the purpose of making money, but as sportsmen pure and simple, makes all cricketers regret that the guarantors may have to be called upon\". The last point alluding to the fact that tour was expected to lose money.\nRace Issues.\nIn 1900 the idea of different races playing together in the same match was a bit of a novelty. Only in the West Indies and India were there significant numbers of coloured cricketers playing. Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji, an Indian prince (universally known as Ranji), had been playing in English cricket for a few years but otherwise coloured cricketers were rarely seen.\nDuring the opening match a formal welcome was given to the team during which it appears that Aucher Warner had made the remark: \"we have come to learn, sir\" to WG Grace. The following day a cartoon appeared in the 'Star' in which \"Dr Grace, a giant is the central figure, bat in hand, and around him, crouching, stooping, imploring are six black urchins of hideous appearance and rather diminutive in size, all of whom are evidently shedding tears. Below appears the words 'We have come to learn, sah!.'\" Designed to be amusing, similar cartoons appeared in this and later tours.\nWhen asked whether the coloured members of the team quickly fell into English ways Mr Nock, the Manager, reported: \"Very soon. They are thorough sportsmen, and have given no trouble whatever during the tour.\" Later he says that \"In our first match I was walking through the grounds with Woods, who suddenly said to me: Mr. Nock they \"have\" got a lot of white people in this country!\".\nWoods himself is reported as saying about the tour: \"I enjoyed it very much. There was the cricket and going about in trains; I liked the views very much. The travelling didn't tire me much and I never had to be left out of the team. I think I should like to live in England, though I don't know whether I could stand the cold in the winter.\"\nIt is also worth noting that Ollivierre, a coloured Amateur, was signed up by Derbyshire during the tour and played for them for a number of years.\nMuch has been made over the years of Gilbert Jessop's innings of 157 in an hour and the reactions of the coloured cricketers. C.L.R. James reports that Float Woods \"went to his captain and asked permission to take off his boots. West Indian captain Aucher Warner asked him why: he replied that he could bowl properly only when barefooted. Woods was making the best response he knew to a truly desperate situation.\" Sammy Woods in his autobiography reports that Jessop \"hit the two famous Black Bowlers (Cumberbatch and Woods) so furiously that not only they couldn't bowl for laughter, but the rest of the dark ones in the field rolled about and set up a howl of delight\". Archie Cumberbatch was, of course, not on the tour at all and this and other remarks are probably embellished. Overall the reports are of doubtful accuracy and have racist undertones to them.\nSo from what is reported it seems that race was not a major issue during the tour. Whether this really reflects the reality is difficult to tell at this distance in time.\nAverages.\nThe following averages are for all 17 matches.\nBatting.\nPF Warner played in 1 match, scoring 113.\n1 catch was taken by a substitute fielder.\nBowling.\nWoods bowled 5 no balls and 1 wide. Burton 1 no ball, Cox 1 no ball and 1 wide, Mignon 7 wides, Constantine 1 wide."

        "title": "West Indian cricket team in England in 1928",
        "text": "The West Indian cricket team that toured England in the 1928 season was the first to play Test cricket. The team was not very successful, losing all three Tests by an innings and winning only five of the 30 first-class matches played.\nThe background to the tour.\nIn 1926, the Imperial Cricket Conference, forerunner of the International Cricket Council, allowed for the first time delegates from India, New Zealand and the West Indies to attend. The three were invited to organise themselves into cricket boards that could, in future, select representative teams to take part in Test matches, which had hitherto been restricted to sides from England, Australia and South Africa.\nThe West Indian cricket tour of England in 1928 was the first of these new Test-playing ventures, and it was backed heavily by the cricket establishment because of the success of the 1923 West Indian cricket team in England, when the side won 12 matches.\nThe West Indies touring team.\nThe West Indies team had 17 members, four each from Jamaica, Trinidad (now Trinidad and Tobago) and British Guiana (now Guyana) and five from Barbados. The side was captained by Karl Nunes, who had been vice-captain of the 1923 touring side.\nThe players were:\nAll of the 17 players with the exceptions of Neblett and Rae played in at least one of the three Test matches: Neblett later played once for West Indies against England in 1934-35, but Rae, the father of the later Test cricketer Allan Rae, never played in a Test match.\nSeven of the 17 – Nunes, Browne, Challenor, Constantine, Fernandes, Francis and Small – had toured with the 1923 touring team, but five years on the batsmen Challenor, Fernandes and Small were unable to repeat their success of 1923, and Francis and Browne were less successful in bowling. Lack of a frontline wicketkeeper – George Dewhurst from the 1923 team did not play in 1928 – meant that Nunes was the main wicketkeeper.\nTest series.\nThree Test matches were arranged, each of three days' duration.\n1st Test.\nJack Hobbs being unfit, England, on winning the toss, opened with Herbert Sutcliffe and Charlie Hallows, and the three West Indian fast bowlers, Constantine, Griffith and Francis, plus Browne, caused early discomfort. But though wickets fell fairly regularly, runs were also scored very fast. Ernest Tyldesley made 122 and captain Percy Chapman 50, and at the end of the first day England had reached 382 for eight. Constantine, who finished with four for 82, ended the innings quickly on the second morning. West Indies, opening with Martin and Challenor, reached 70 without loss by lunchtime, and the partnership went to 86 before Martin was out to Maurice Tate for 44. Five wickets then fell for 10 runs and though Nunes made 37, Vallance Jupp and Tich Freeman took the last five wickets in two hours. Following on, the West Indies did worse, and lost their first six wickets for just 44 runs before the end of the second day. On the final morning, 52 from Small and 44 from Browne brought the second innings total to 166 before the match ended after 90 minutes' play.\n2nd Test.\nThe tourists made two changes, bringing in Hoad, who had made an unbeaten 149 in a two-day match against Worcestershire three days before this Test started, and Scott. They replaced Fernandes and Small. On a lifeless pitch, West Indies won the toss and batted. Roach, promoted to open, made 50 and put on 48 with Challenor and 46 with Martin. The team then collapsed to 133 for six before Browne and Scott took the total beyond 200. Freeman took five wickets for 54 runs for England. Hobbs, restored to health, and Sutcliffe made 119 for the first England wicket. After three quick wickets, Wally Hammond with 63 put on 120 with Douglas Jardine. A further small collapse followed, including Chapman retiring injured, and Jardine, top scorer with 83, but the tail took the total to 351.\nIn the second innings, West Indies lost two wickets quickly, but Martin and St Hill put on 55 and at the end of the second day, West Indies were 71 for four. The innings ended rather abjectly on the third morning, only 44 further runs being made in 50 minutes. Freeman again took five wickets, this time for 39 runs, to finish with match figures of 10 for 93.\n3rd Test.\nThe third match followed a very similar pattern to the second, with the West Indians making a good start through Roach (53) and Challenor (46), but no other batsman getting beyond the 30s. The total of 238 was, though, the highest of the series for the touring side. Hobbs and Sutcliffe made 155 for the first wicket, and Hobbs and Tyldesley then added 129 before Hobbs was out for 159 with the score at 284. Five further wickets then fell in the next hour for 49 runs, all of them to Griffith, whose innings figures of six for 103 were the best of the series for the West Indies. Tate and Harold Larwood then added 61 in 25 minutes and the last three wickets made 105 runs. West Indies' second innings, as in the previous Tests, began badly, and only a stubborn 41 from Martin enabled the side to reach three figures. As at Lord's and Old Trafford, the match was over before lunch on the third day.\nOther matches.\nIncluding the three Tests, 30 first-class matches were played on the tour, plus six other games. The West Indians won just seven of these 36 matches (five of the first-class games) and lost 12.\nBy the end of May, the touring side had won matches against Derbyshire and Cambridge University, plus a minor match against Northumberland, and had drawn all the other games. Defeat by Ireland in a three-day game was followed by a tight victory over Middlesex. But the final first-class game before the First Test saw a sensational defeat by the Minor Counties, who won by 42 runs after being made to follow on.\nIn the final two months of the season, there were good victories over Northamptonshire and Kent, plus a minor match against Staffordshire, for whom Sydney Barnes, aged 55, took five wickets. But there were heavy defeats by Yorkshire, with the tourists dismissed for 58 all out in the second innings, by Warwickshire, and by Sussex, even though the county rested Maurice Tate, Duleepsinhji and James Langridge. A first-class side representing Wales and including Sydney Barnes also won; Barnes took 12 wickets in this match.\nAt the end of the tour, the West Indians lost three festival matches at Eastbourne, Folkestone and Scarborough.\nIndividual performances.\nThe star performer on the tour was Learie Constantine, though he failed in the Test matches. He scored the most first-class runs, with 1,381 at an average of 34.52 runs per innings, took the most first-class wickets, with 107 at 22.95 each, and was the only player to score three centuries in the first-class matches.\nMartin, Challenor and Roach also scored more than 1,000 runs in the first-class matches, and Hoad, who came good in the second half of the tour, did so in all matches. Challenor, who had scored 1,556 first-class runs at an average of 51.86 and with six centuries in 1923, made just 1,074 runs at 27.53 runs per innings and failed to score a first-class century on the 1928 tour. Griffith took 103 wickets in all matches.\nVerdict and aftermath.\nThe poor performance of the West Indian team led to some unfavourable comment. Wisden for 1929, reporting on the tour as a whole, was damning. \"So far from improving upon the form of their predecessors, the team of 1928 fell so much below it that everybody was compelled to realise that the playing of Test matches between England and West Indies was a mistake,\" it said. \"Whatever the future may have in store, the time is certainly not yet when the West Indies can hope to challenge England with a reasonable hope of success.\"\nThe official verdict was less condemnatory, and MCC reported of the West Indies side that \"much of their cricket was of a high order\". MCC agreed to send a side to the West Indies for four Test matches in 1929-30. This tour coincided with a second tour to New Zealand, where the first Test matches against that country were played, and several leading England players opted out of both of the tours. But what was, in effect, an England second eleven had to settle for a shared series, with each side winning one match. This series saw the emergence of George Headley as the first great West Indian batting star, and Wisden's prediction of a long haul towards parity with England proved pessimistic."

        "text": "The West Indian cricket team in England in 1973 played 17 first-class matches including three Tests. The team won the series against England by two matches to nil, with one drawn game. It also won the Prudential Trophy for the one-day series.\nThe West Indies team.\nThe West Indies team was captained by Rohan Kanhai, who had succeeded Gary Sobers as captain for the Australian series in the West Indies the previous winter.\nThe West Indies side had dropped back in form from its peak in the mid-1960s, with the retirement of its great fast bowlers Charlie Griffith and Wes Hall and some of its leading batsmen, such as Conrad Hunte and Basil Butcher. The period under Sobers' captaincy after the series victory in England in 1966 was not particularly successful, and Test series against England were lost in 1967–68 and in 1969. India won in the West Indies in 1970–71, and the first-ever New Zealand tour to the West Indies in 1971–72 produced a series in which all five Tests were drawn.\nSobers' handing over of the captaincy to Kanhai did not bring a change of fortune. Australia won the 1972–73 Test series by two matches to nil with three draws to retain the Frank Worrell Trophy that Bill Lawry had won by beating Sobers' side in 1968–69. As England had beaten Australia in Australia in 1970–71 and had retained The Ashes in a drawn series in 1972, the West Indians were regarded in 1973 as the underdogs for the series against England.\nThe original side for the 1973 tour was:\nCamacho suffered a broken cheekbone while batting in the second first-class match of the tour and took no further part: the bowler who inflicted the injury, Hampshire's Andy Roberts, would make his West Indies debut within a year. Lawrence Rowe had strained ligaments in the previous winter's series against Australia and withdrew from the tour when it was apparent that the injury was not getting better. Camacho was replaced by Ron Headley, highly experienced in English conditions from a long career at Worcestershire. Gary Sobers, who opted out of the tour after knee surgery and played the 1973 English cricket season instead with Nottinghamshire, was drafted in for the three Test matches.\nOf the starting tour party, only David Murray, Inshan Ali and Willett had not toured or played county cricket in England before, and only Julien and David Murray had not played Test cricket. Ron Headley was also new to Test matches in this series.\nThe touring side was managed by the former West Indies cricketer, Esmond Kentish.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nWest Indies' first innings was built around a fourth wicket partnership of 208 between Clive Lloyd, who made 132, and Kallicharran (80) and enlivened by a late 72 from Boyce. Boyce was then the pick of the bowlers with five wickets for 70 as England collapsed 257 all out after being 247 for five. Only Geoffrey Boycott, with 97, passed 40. West Indies' second innings featured Ron Headley's highest Test score (42, in his first match), plus the second 80 of the match from Kallicharran and 51 from Sobers. Boyce improved his figures in the England second innings, taking six for 77, with three for 61 from Gibbs. The main resistance came from Frank Hayes, who scored an undefeated 106 in his first Test match. Boyce's match figures of 11 for 147 were the best for West Indies versus England at the time (subsequently beaten by Michael Holding with 14 for 149, also at The Oval, in 1976).\n2nd Test.\nDefensive tactics by the West Indies and a dispute involving umpire Arthur Fagg marked a game which ended as a fairly tame draw. On the first day, West Indies scored just 190 runs, with 98 of them to the normally attacking Roy Fredericks, who went on to reach 150 on day two. England captain Ray Illingworth bowled 27 overs for 18 runs in the day. Three England batsmen (Boycott, Dennis Amiss and Keith Fletcher) reached fifties, but none went much further and Boycott was injured in a collision with wicketkeeper Deryck Murray. On the third day, umpire Fagg refused to take the field over the West Indies' querying of a not-out decision in favour of Boycott, but he resumed after one over. England were little more enterprising than the West Indies, whose over rate was also very slow. The match was two-thirds over before the first two innings were concluded: West Indies' second innings, with 94 from Lloyd and 74 from Sobers, was faster, but England never attempted a task of 325 in 230 minutes.\n3rd Test.\nEngland's second worst defeat in Test cricket at this stage came as they were totally outplayed. For West Indies, Kanhai (157), Sobers (150 not out) and a maiden Test century from Julien (121) led to a huge total, at the time the highest by a West Indies Test team in England. Only Fletcher, with 68, coped with hostile bowling from Vanburn Holder and Boyce, and when England followed on Fletcher was again the main resistance, scoring an undefeated 86. A bomb scare on the Saturday led to the ground being evacuated for 85 minutes; it was decided to add extra time to each of the remaining days of the match, but with the West Indies winning with a day and a half to spare it was not needed.\nODI series.\nTwo 55-overs-per-side matches were played for the Prudential Trophy. England were captained for the first time by Mike Denness, who succeeded Ray Illingworth.\n1st ODI.\nThe captains top-scored for their teams (Kanhai with 55, Denness with 66); Chris Old and Derek Underwood each took three wickets as West Indies' middle order failed to build on a good start; Tony Greig took England to the brink of victory with 48, but three quick wickets then left last pair Underwood and Bob Willis to score six to win. Denness was Man of the Match.\n2nd ODI.\nA comfortable victory for West Indies won them the Prudential Trophy for a faster scoring rate over the two games. Only Keith Fletcher, with 63, shone in England's innings as Lance Gibbs bowled his 11 overs for just 12 runs and Clive Lloyd, drafted in to bowl because Sobers was unfit, took two for 25. Man of the Match Roy Fredericks made 105 and put on 143 with Alvin Kallicharran (53 not out) to take his side to within four of victory.\nOther Matches.\nThe West Indies side played 14 first-class matches outside the Tests. They beat Hampshire, Nottinghamshire, Glamorgan, and Derbyshire. Their only defeat was in a match with Derrick Robins' XI which included England batsmen Boycott and Amiss, Clive Rice, Bishen Bedi, Mushtaq Mohammad and Intikhab Alam. The other nine matches were drawn.\nFour other non first-class matches were played, three of them one-day matches.\nTour statistics.\nThe Test match batting averages were headed by Gary Sobers with 306 runs at an average of 76.50. Clive Lloyd top scored with 318 runs in the three matches. Keith Boyce was the most successful Test bowler with 19 wickets at 15.47 each.\nOn the tour as a whole, behind Sobers (who only played in Tests), the top batsman was Maurice Foster, whose 828 runs came at an average of 63.69. Clive Lloyd and Roy Fredericks both scored more than 1000 runs. Boyce was the most successful of the regular bowlers in terms of both aggregate (41 wickets) and average (22.46)."

        "text": "The West Indies cricket team toured England in the 2000 cricket season. West Indies played five Tests against England - two in June and three in August - with a triangular One Day International (ODI) series involving Zimbabwe in July.\nIn June, West Indies won the 1st Test at Edgbaston convincingly, before England narrowly won the 2nd Test at Lord's, having bowled West Indies out for 54 in their second innings.\nThe ODI series, sponsored by NatWest, took place in July, with England, West Indies and Zimbabwe all playing each other three times, and the two best teams qualifying for the final. West Indies lost four of their six matches, including all three against Zimbabwe. England beat Zimbabwe in the final at Lord's, thus winning an ODI tournament for the first time in two years.\nThe Test series concluded in August. After the 3rd Test at Old Trafford was drawn, England won the 4th Test at Headingley inside two days, bowling West Indies out for 61 in their second innings. They then won the 5th Test at The Oval, thus securing their first series victory against West Indies for 31 years.\nIn all five Tests and the ODI series, West Indies were captained by Jimmy Adams. Nasser Hussain captained England in the 1st Test before breaking a thumb while playing for Essex; Alec Stewart deputised in the 2nd Test and for much of the ODI series before Hussain returned.\nThe ball dominated the bat for most of the Test series, with a bowler taking five wickets in an innings on seven occasions (Courtney Walsh twice for West Indies, Andrew Caddick and Craig White twice each and Darren Gough once for England), but only three batsmen scoring centuries (Stewart and Brian Lara in the drawn 3rd Test, and Michael Atherton in the 5th). A hallmark of the series was the inconsistency of the West Indies batting: the team passed 300 runs only twice, and were twice dismissed in the second innings for less than 70 runs. England only passed 300 once, in the 3rd Test, but consistently recorded scores between 150 and 300.\nAtherton scored the most runs for either team (311), while Marcus Trescothick, who made his Test debut in the 3rd Test, headed the batting averages with 47.50. Sherwin Campbell scored the most runs for West Indies (270), while Ramnaresh Sarwan had the team's best batting average (40.75).\nWalsh took the most wickets for either team (34), thus becoming the first winner of the Malcolm Marshall Memorial Trophy; he was also named West Indies' player of the series. Gough took the most wickets for England (25), and was his team's player of the series. While Gough was well supported by Caddick (22) and Dominic Cork (20), Walsh took twice as many wickets as his long-time partner Curtly Ambrose (17), who retired from cricket after the 5th Test."

        "text": "The West Indian cricket team toured England from 12 May to 7 July 2007 as part of the 2007 English cricket season. The tour included four Tests, two Twenty20 international matches and three One Day Internationals. While England dominated the Test series 3–0, including a record victory over the West Indies, the latter took the ODI series 2:1.\nComparative performances.\nTest matches.\nIn the ICC Test Championship, England are ranked second and West Indies are ranked eighth, though England's most recent series was a whitewash loss in the Ashes against Australia for the first time since 1921, their first Test series loss since their tour of Pakistan in 2005. West Indies, meanwhile, lost 2–0 to Pakistan in November 2006 as their last Test series, and have not won a Test since April 2005. The last time West Indies won an away Test to a nation currently ranked above them was on their tour of England in 2000 – they also beat Zimbabwe and Bangladesh twice during the intervening seven years.\nOne-Day Internationals.\nThe ICC ODI Championship sees England ranked just ahead of West Indies, as seventh and eighth respectively, though West Indies are more competitive in ODIs. They finished fifth and sixth in the Super Eight stage of the recent World Cup, with England finishing ahead of West Indies by virtue of their one-wicket win. West Indies, however, reached the final of the Champions Trophy in October 2006, and defeated India 4–1 in a home series in May. England also acquired one ODI series win in the past year, defeating Australia in the final of the 2007 Commonwealth Bank Series, their first series win abroad since 1998. They were, however, defeated 0–5 at home by Sri Lanka in June, as well as drawing 2–2 with Pakistan.\nSquads.\nThis was Peter Moores' first series as England Coach, and Andy Flower, former Zimbabwe wicket-keeper batsman, was his newly appointed assistant. Michael Vaughan had been set to return to Test cricket for his first match in 17 months after captaining England during the World Cup, but an injury to his finger ruled him out of the first Test, and Andrew Strauss was appointed as captain in his place. James Anderson was a late addition to the squad as cover for Andrew Flintoff, though neither eventually played the first Test. Flintoff was also ruled out of playing in the second Test, despite having been named in the squads for both of the first two Tests.\nDuring the first Test Matthew Hoggard suffered an injury, and took no further part in the match after the first West Indian innings, and he was also ruled out of playing in the second Test. His replacement was Ryan Sidebottom, recalled six years after his only previous Test, while Vaughan returned from injury as captain. Owais Shah was dropped to make way for Vaughan. Hoggard was called back to the England squad for the fourth and final Test at Chester-le-Street pending his fitness, while Liam Plunkett was dropped.\nDuring the Fourth Test, Vaughan abruptly announced his resignation from the one-day captaincy, and was replaced by Paul Collingwood. The subsequent squad announcement then saw Vaughan and out-of-form Andrew Strauss dropped in favour of Jonathan Trott and Dimitri Mascarenhas.\nFor West Indies, Brian Lara had retired from all cricket at the end of the World Cup, and Ramnaresh Sarwan replaced him as captain for this series. Lendl Simmons had been dropped since the tour of Pakistan, and Devon Smith and Sylvester Joseph entered the squad as specialist batsmen. Spinners Omari Banks and Dave Mohammed had been left out for seamers Ravi Rampaul and Darren Sammy.\nSarwan injured his collarbone during the second Test at Headingley, ruling him out of the remainder of the tour. Marlon Samuels was called up as his replacement, while Daren Ganga was named stand-in captain for the remainder of the Test series. There was speculation that the selectors named Chris Gayle as captain of the ODI squad, only for the West Indies Cricket Board to reject the decision and asked the selectors to include Daren Ganga as captain instead.\nIn the end, Gayle was chosen as one-day captain, with Shivnarine Chanderpaul assuming vice-captaincy duties. Also, one-day specialists Austin Richards, Dwayne Smith and a recalled Simmons were called in to replace Joseph, Ganga and Corey Collymore.\nTest series.\n2nd Test.\nThis was West Indies' heaviest defeat in Test cricket. The fourth day was played with the temperature around seven degrees Celsius in the morning; the coldest playing conditions for a Test in England.\n3rd Test.\nEngland, looking to take an unassailable lead in the series, batted first, sending Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook to the wicket, but Strauss was dismissed in single figures, his fourteenth innings without making it past 50, plumb lbw by Jerome Taylor. Captain Michael Vaughan joined Cook and held the fence until lunch, with Cook reaching the fifty just before the end of the session with the total on the 112.\nTwelve overs after lunch yielded three wickets and 20 runs. Vaughan, seeking centuries in successive Test matches for the first time since the 2002–03 Ashes, was clean bowled for 42 by Corey Collymore, Kevin Pietersen was caught by Bravo off Collymore, while Cook was bowled by debutant Darren Sammy. Paul Collingwood met with Ian Bell for the fifth-wicket partnership, though Bell was the dominant partner as the two made 32 in twelve overs before Taylor struck to leave England at 166 for five. However, the last five provided more than the top five, largely due to Ian Bell who made 97, three short of his seventh Test century, leaving him with a batting average of 84 batting at six in Test cricket. The tenth-wicket also did better than their batting averages would suggest, with Monty Panesar and Ryan Sidebottom both passing 14 in a 32-run partnership before Fidel Edwards bowled Panesar. Extras, with 47, was the third-highest scorer behind Bell and Cook.\nWith just three overs before lunch, the West Indies made six runs in the first over before an unpredictable over from Steve Harmison, who conceded six runs with wides before delivering his first legal delivery of the Test. However, in a 9-ball over, he did get Daren Ganga out lbw for 6. During the lunch break, West Indies lodged a complaint against Harmison who had unwittingly contravened Law 17 by practising on the match strip before the innings. The complaint was denied \nHarmison conceded 15 more runs, as well as six byes and two leg-byes, in three overs after lunch, but Liam Plunkett struck with his third ball and West Indies were two down for 49. Devon Smith, Runako Morton, Shiv Chanderpaul and Dwayne Bravo all provided passed 20 runs, with Smith and Chanderpaul having the staying power to bat more than an hour, and at 216 for four West Indies were 56 ahead of the English score at the fall of the fifth wicket. However, in the space of 43 balls West Indies lost six wickets, with Ryan Sidebottom and Monty Panesar splitting them evenly and conceding 13 runs in the process. Once again, extras was a near-top-scorer, only eight runs short of Chanderpaul's 50.\nAndrew Strauss failed to proved himself again with a second ball lbw, falling for successive double-digit scores for the first time in 35 Test matches, leaving No. 3 Vaughan to effectively open once more. With the total on 28, and both batsmen with two fours to their name, Denesh Ramdin threw up the ball after an appeal off Cook, who scurried for a single in the confusion. Cook was awarded a run, though as the ball hadn't hit bat and he wasn't caught behind, it was eventually a bye. Then, Ramdin let slip a sitter through his legs which went on to hit his helmet, boosting the English with a mandatory five penalty runs before the second day's play ended.\nEngland, having achieved a lead of 141 on first innings, pushed onwards on the third day, losing one wicket in each of the first two sessions, though they had the benefit of West Indies' fielding being between \"amateurish and abysmal\" according to Cricinfo journalist Andrew McGlashan. Vaughan fell in the forties once again, a return catch for Darren Sammy's second Test wicket, while Kevin Pietersen fell to a bizarre dismissal when West Indian all-rounder Dwayne Bravo delivered a 70 mph bouncer, knocking off Pietersen's helmet which fell onto the stumps, leaving Pietersen out hit wicket. After tea, Gayle broke through to have Cook lbw for 106, before Sammy took six wickets in a seven-over spell to end with figures of seven for 66, the second best by a West Indies bowler on debut, and the best by a debutant in 57 years. Among the wickets was Bell's for two, causing his average at six to drop between 75. The fourth innings had only 8 overs in which Gayle scored a quick four, but Harmison continued the Test's string of early dismissals trapping Ganga plumb for a duck. This didn't stop the West Indies attacking to their target of 455 as 3 more fours were hit, despite two massive appeals from Panesar. The Windies batted slowly and carefully over the two days and ended up falling only 61 runs short of winning the match. If they had reached the total it would have been the highest fourth innings total ever to win a Test match. Shivnarine Chanderpaul top scored with 116 not out.\nODI series.\n1st ODI.\nFidel Edwards claimed his second ODI 5-wicket haul; the 8th ODI 5-wicket haul at Lord's.\n3rd ODI.\nEngland started well getting the early wicket of Devon Smith in the third over, but a good partnership between Chris Gayle and Shivnarine Chanderpaul, producing a second-wicket partnership of 77 gave West Indies a strong platform. England then got two quick wickets of Chanderpaul and Samuels in the space of 15 deliveries to put the game in the balance. West Indies solidified their position, however, with Runako Morton and Chris Gayle putting on 85 for the fourth wicket. Quick batting from Dwayne Bravo (42 runs from 24 balls) ensured that the West Indies set a good score of 289/5 at the end of the innings and England needed 290 runs to win.\nWest Indies in Ireland.\nFollowing the completion of their tour to England, the West Indies will play in a Four-Nations ODI tournament in Ireland, where they will play One Day Internationals against the hosts, the Netherlands and Scotland."

While the tour was singularly unsuccessful in terms of results, it paved the way for another trip by the Parsis two years later and more tours by English teams to India in the next decade.\nBackground.\nThe Parsis in Bombay were probably the earliest local community in India to take up cricket. Vasant Raiji recounts that Parsi schoolboys were being coached in 1839 and, when they grew up, they formed the Oriental Cricket Club in 1848. In 1876, the prominent Parsi player A. B. Patel formed the Parsee Cricket Club.\nIn 1877, the Parsis played their first match against Bombay Gymkhana. The earliest plan at a tour of England by a Parsi team was made by A. B. Patel in 1878. It fell through when Patel got involved in a libel suit and was unable to proceed with the plans.\nA few years later Patel, with the help of B. B. Baria and Dr Dhunjishaw Patel, made another attempt to organise the tour. C. W. Alcock, the Secretary of the Surrey Cricket Club served as the agent for the team in England. Robert Henderson, a Surrey professional, acted as the coach.\nThe team.\nThe members of the team were :\nThe tour.\nThe Parsi team was essentially made of enthusiasts who were willing to pay their own expenses for the tour. Dhunjishaw Patel, a fast underarm bowler and decent batsman, captained the side. In terms of results, the team made little impression. Of the twenty eight matches, they won only one and lost 19.\nAfter a three-week voyage, the Parsis played their first match on May 24 against the Lord Sheffield's XI. The second match of the tour was against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) for whom W. G. Grace played at the request of the tourists. Parsis went on to lose by an innings and 224 runs, Grace scored 65 and took 11 wickets for 44 runs in the match. Most of the matches were similarly one-sided. The Parsis crossed 200 only once and scored only four fifties between them. Two notable performances in bowling were Shapurjee Bhedwar's hat-trick and 6 for 27 against Chiswick and Ashton. The only victory was on first innings against Normanhurst in a one-day game.\nThe last match of the tour at Cumberland Lodge against Prince Christian Victor's XII was arranged on the express desire of Queen Victoria. Prince Victor and his brother Prince Albert took part in the game. At the end of the match a garden party was held in honour of the guests. The team left England on August 24.\nMatch scores.\n1.

        "title": "Indian cricket team in England in 1911",
        "text": "The Indian cricket team touring England and the British Isles in the summer of 1911 was the first all-Indian team to tour the country. The team was led by the then 19-year old Maharaja of Patiala Bhupinder Singh and had representation from the Parsees, Hindus, and the Muslims. The team had limited success winning only two amongst the 23 matches that they played on the tour.\nBackground.\nThe early 1900s were marked with violence between young Indians and British officials in India. It was then decided that a pan-national team touring England would generate goodwill and portray a positive image of the British empire. The first all-Indian team to tour the British Isles was in 1911, which had representation from the Parsees, the Hindus, and the Muslims. The team was captained by the then Maharaja of Patiala, Bhupinder Singh, who was then aged 19.\nIndian squad.\nIn the 19th century, two representative teams of the Parsees had toured England in 1886 and 1888 with limited success. However, these teams were limited by representation and were not an all-Indian team.\nWhen the organizers of the tour were putting together the team, their first choice of a captain was Ranjitsinhji, the \"Jam Sahib\", who by the time had been instated as the ruler of Nawanagar in 1907. However, Ranji was keeping away from organized cricket in British India, having been called out for his administrative lapses in tackling the plague and subsequent drought that had afflicted his state. Ranji declined the invitation and sent across a note offering his 'cordial sympathy' and instead offered Rupees 1,000 toward the guarantee fund. Two other cricketing royals who were already in Britain, Rajkumar Shivaji Rao of Baroda and Rajkumar Hitendara Narayan of Cooch Behar, who were both pursuing their studies, were not considered for captaincy. Rao was the son of Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III of Baroda, and was studying at Christ Church, Oxford, while Narayan was the son of Nripendra Narayan and was at Eton College and later at Cambridge. With this, the organizers landed on the Maharaja of Patiala, Bhupinder Singh, as the captain of the team. Some reports, including a statement from one of the selectors said that another factor for this choice was to get the services of the Maharajah's private secretary Kekhashru Mistry.\nThe eventual Indian squad of 1911, captained by Maharajah Bhupinder Singh of Patiala, also had his aide-de-camp and Parsee cricketer Major Kekhashru Mistry, and had representation by way of six Parsis, five Hindus, and three Muslims. The team also had two Dalits, then considered as 'untouchables', Palwankar Baloo and his brother Palwankar Shivram. Shivram was hurriedly called into the team after two players, Maneck Chand and Noor Elahi, withdrew from the tour in the days prior to the tour, due per some accounts to their employer, the Maharajah of Kashmir, rescinding permission to have them take part in the tour.\nSource(s): \nSummary.\nThe all-Indian team played 23 games in the British Isles between 1 June 1911 and 26 August 1911. The team did not have much success winning only two of the games. \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" called the tournament a \"complete disappointment\".\nReception.\nThe Indian team departed Bombay on 6 May 1911 from Ballard Pier, seen off by a large crowd, and reached Marseille two weeks later. They covered the further journey to London by train. While the captain, the Maharaja of Patiala, covered the trip in a deluxe train and got off at Charing Cross, the rest of the team members covered this journey in a regular train. There was significant attention on the Maharaja, with the \"Daily Express\" writing, \"His Highness's gorgeous costume of rich flowered silk of bright hue attracted much attention as he strode the platform wearing about his neck a garland of roses.\" The Maharaja was received at the Buckingham Palace by George V, whose coronation was a few weeks away. He addressed the media from his a private villa that had been rented for him on Addison Road in Kensington and told the \"Sporting Life\", \"This tour marks an epoch in Indian history. It is the first occasion in the annals of our country that the great Indian communities have been banded together in one team. Association in the sports field, the bringing together in one common object all classes of our race, and the meeting with the best class of English sportsmen, can only strengthen the bonds of union and good-fellowship.\" While the Maharaja stayed at the private villa, the rest of the Indian team continued to the Victoria station and stayed at the Imperial Hotel. The manager of the team, J. M. Divecha, viewed the tour as an educational trip and told the \"Sporting Life,\" \"We know that we cannot claim to be great cricketers but we hope to be much better for our experiences, and we will carry back to India and assimilate the knowledge we have gained here.\"\nTour summary.\nThe Indian team started the tour by playing against three of the stronger teams, Oxford University, Marylebone Cricket Club, and the Cambridge University. In these three games, the team was beaten comprehensively, twice by an innings and once by eight wickets. During this time, the team was plagued by the captain, the Maharaja, being away for societal events and other responsibilities. He spent much of his time socializing with the London elite, attending parties and the various coronation-related events. He even had a private audience with the King, George V, and was a guest of his in the royal pavilion at Ascot. In July, after the coronation of the king, the Maharaja had a surgery for tonsillitis and suffered a hemmorage. With these events, the Maharaja shortened his stay with the team and returned to India after three games. He took his aide-de-camp and batsman K. M. Mistry, the team's best batsman, back along with him significantly weakening the team's capabilities.\nAfter the Maharaja's departure, the team was captained by Parsee, Hormasji Kanga. Kanga had earlier represented Hampstead Cricket Club in a prior season, and had also played for the MCC after completing his medical studies earlier in England.\nReturn to India.\nThe return of the team back to India found a lot of coverage in the Indian media. \"The Hindu\" wrote, \"It must be regretfully acknowledged that judging by the performances of the team, the best cricket in India is only second class\". The \"Indian Spectator\", wrote, \"Our national cricket team has returned from England with the confession that it had to learn much and teach little.\" Some of the European owned newspapers were more appreciative of the team's performance, with the Bombay Gazette writing, \"The Indian cricketers' tour has come to an end and they can look back upon their record with justifiable pride'."

        "title": "2008 Australian Open",
        "text": "The 2008 Australian Open was a tennis tournament played on outdoor hard courts. It was the 96th edition of the Australian Open, and the first Grand Slam event of the year. It took place at the Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Australia, from 14 through 27 January 2008.\nAfter twenty years of playing on Rebound Ace, the courts were changed to Plexicushion, a marginally faster surface. The new surface is thinner, and therefore has lower heat retention. This decision was made in a bid to reduce the \"stick\" of the court and the frequency of the extreme heat policy being invoked. However, the new surface faced criticism for being too similar to DecoTurf, the surface used at the US Open. Player reaction to the change of surface was generally ambivalent.\nBoth Roger Federer and Serena Williams were unsuccessful in defending their 2007 titles; Federer losing to Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals and Williams losing in the quarter-finals to Jelena Janković. Djokovic won his first Grand Slam singles title, defeating unseeded Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the final; Maria Sharapova, runner-up to Williams in 2007, defeated Ana Ivanovic to win her first Australian Open title and third Grand Slam title.\nFor the mixed doubles, in every game, the first team to score four points, won the game. In other words, when a deuce happened in a game, the team who won the next point won the game.\nNotable stories.\nSurface change.\nOn 30 May 2007, Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley announced that as of the 2008 Australian Open, the Rebound Ace surface that had been used since 1988 would be replaced by a newer, faster Plexicushion surface. The Rebound Ace surface had been criticized for several years, from players including Andy Roddick and Mark Philippoussis, who claimed that the \"stick\" of the court was a contributing factor in many players injuring themselves. This \"stick\" was a result of the thick rubber mat (10 mm) laid beneath the surface, the high heat retention because of this, and the high temperatures present during the Australian summer, which intermittently resulted in the extreme heat policy being invoked. Conversely, players such as Pete Sampras and Marat Safin put the high number of injuries down to lack of preparation from players; partly due to the fact that the tournament is held so early in the year, but also because there were so few tournaments preceding it. Rebound Ace was also chastised by Lleyton Hewitt for having an inconsistent bounce, in terms of height and pace (shock absorption); and claimed that these factors varied depending on the weather. The heat retention of the surface had also been a point of contention between players.\nIn announcing the change, Tiley said Plexicushion would have a \"lower rubber content than Rebound Ace, was firmer under foot and retained less heat through its thinner top layer.\" Tiley later said that the change of colour, from green to blue, would also benefit players and officials, although this change was quite arbitrary. The manufacturers of Rebound Ace derided the new surface, with director Paul Bull saying that, \"We had an Australian icon event with a unique Australian product and now we are just going to become a clone of the US Open.\" Bull also said that the inconsistencies in pace were down to the organizers' imperative, who kept asking for the pace to be adjusted to pander for certain players, such as Hewitt. Bull, however, conceded that a change was needed; and said that the suggestion of a Rebound Ace court with a rubber mat thickness of around 5 mm was made.\nThe Plexicushion surface received a relatively mixed reception from players. Lleyton Hewitt, Justine Henin and Serena Williams were all keen to endorse the new courts; with Hewitt's appraisal focused on the greater consistency of the courts. Henin called it a \"good surface\" but said she did not find it markedly distinguishable from Rebound Ace, saying the biggest difference was the change of colour. Williams claimed that the court was not as \"bouncy\" and was causing less physical strain on her feet and ankles. One source of criticism from players was the slower than expected pace, although many of these comments came prior to the event's commencement. Players were exposed to the new courts through other tournaments, played in advance of the Open; and practise on the new surface. Roger Federer described it as slow, with Novak Djokovic, Jelena Janković and James Blake all corroborating this opinion, albeit from experience in preliminary tournaments. Pundit and former World No. 1 Pat Rafter said it was possible that the courts would speed up in time.\nImplementation of anti-corruption policing.\nOn 21 December 2007, organizers of the event announced that the tournament would be watched under the scrutiny of anti-corruption officials. A partnership was formed with Victoria Police. This announcement came in the wake of a series of scandals to hit the sport, including World No. 4 Nikolay Davydenko coming under suspicion of match fixing; with at least a dozen other players coming forward about having been approached to influence matches in an unethical manner. Tennis Australia chief executive Steve Wood commented that, \"Match-fixing and illegal gambling are a threat to the integrity of sport. We're putting our policies, procedures and programme in place to protect it.\"\nThis was followed by a statement from the wider community of the International Tennis Federation (ITF), Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), Women's Tennis Association (WTA) and organizers of all four Grand Slams that they would review their anti-corruption policies in the future. This announcement came six days prior to the start of the Open, on 8 January 2008.\nCrowd trouble.\nOn 15 January, Day 2 of the tournament, Victoria Police had to intervene when Greek Australian supporters, following Greece's Konstantinos Economidis in his match against Chilean Fernando González, became unruly. The match, in progress at the Margaret Court Arena, was suspended for ten minutes as the police attempted stop the \"offensive chanting\" and eject certain fans. Approximately forty supporters, heavily outnumbered by Chilean fans, were warned of their disorderly conduct prior to the police deploying pepper spray. The police regiment was heavily outnumbered, with a BBC Radio employee commenting that, \"[there were] two guys against maybe 70-80, that's not good.\" Tournament officials said that 3 people had been sprayed and 5 evicted; a small proportion of the Greek fans left the arena, upset at how events were transpiring and fearing for their safety.\nBoth players said that the trouble was not something they had witnessed before; and Economidis condemned his supporters, saying that, \"It was a really nice atmosphere until this moment. I am really unhappy.\" Some witnesses have implicated Cypriot and Serbian supporters in the trouble.\nAustralian Open director, Craig Tiley, had announced in the week preceding the event that police and security forces would \"impose a 'zero-tolerance' policy on anti-social behaviour\". This statement appeared to be a delayed reaction to the trouble that marred the event in 2007, with Australian youths of Greek, Serbian and Croatian origins involved in mutually abusive sparring. However, the problem was much more pronounced in 2007, with violence breaking out and around 150 fans ejected.\nSexual assault.\nPolice were called to investigate a report that a 12-year-old girl was indecently assaulted by a drunk man at the Australian Open.\nIn a brief statement, Victoria Police said they received a report that the girl was inappropriately touched on the buttocks on Monday.\n\"The matter was reported to police this morning and the incident is currently being investigated\", the statement said. This event mirrors a series of incidents that occurred at last year's event, when several men attending the tournament were arrested for taking upskirt photographs.\nMarcos Baghdatis video controversy.\nDuring the Open, a video posted on YouTube almost a year earlier made headlines in the Australian media. The video shows the 2008 fifteenth seed, Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis, at a barbecue hosted by his Greek Australian fans in Melbourne in early 2007. In it, Baghdatis is holding a flare and taking part in chants against the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. Melbourne's Turkish Cypriot community called for Baghdatis to be expelled from Australia, but in a statement issued through his manager, the Cypriot player said he was \"supporting the interest of my country, Cyprus, while protesting against a situation that is not recognized by the United Nations\".\nSerbian performance.\nThis tournament saw strong performances from Serbian players. The men's side saw Janko Tipsarević, winner of the boys' tournament in 2001, almost cause an upset when he pushed Roger Federer to five sets in the third round, with the final score being 6–7 (5–7), 7–6 (7–1), 5–7, 6–1, 10–8 in Federer's favour. The match, which overlapped into the night session due to rain earlier in the day, took almost four-and-a-half hours to complete. Third-seed Novak Djokovic became Serbia's first Grand Slam singles title winner (Ana Ivanovic would later become that country's first Grand Slam women's singles title winner, at the 2008 French Open), and the youngest ever winner of the Australian Open, at 20 years and 250 days of age, when he defeated surprise finalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the final, having defeated the defending champion Federer in the semi-finals, and Australian hopeful Lleyton Hewitt in straight sets in the fourth round. Coincidentally, Djokovic would also defeat Federer in straight sets en route to his second Australian Open title, in 2011.\nThe women's draw saw Jelena Janković, the 2001 girls' champion, and Ana Ivanovic produce notable performances to reach the semi-finals and the final, respectively. Janković saved three match points against Tamira Paszek in the first round, before defeating rising Australian player Casey Dellacqua in the fourth round. Janković then ended the title defence of Serena Williams in the quarter-finals, before losing her semi-final to Maria Sharapova. Twenty-four hours after Janković's victory over Serena Williams, Ana Ivanovic recorded her first career victory against Venus Williams in her quarter-final, and went on to reach her second Grand Slam final by defeating Daniela Hantuchová in the semi-finals, having to recover from a 0–6, 0–2 deficit to do so. Ivanovic was then defeated in the final by Maria Sharapova, in a match dubbed as the \"Glam Slam\" final.\nSeniors.\nMen's singles.\n Novak Djokovic defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, 4–6, 6–4, 6–3, 7–6(7–2)\nWomen's singles.\n Maria Sharapova defeated Ana Ivanovic, 7–5, 6–3\nMen's doubles.\n Jonathan Erlich / Andy Ram defeated Arnaud Clément / Michaël Llodra, 7–5, 7–6(7–4)\nWomen's doubles.\n Alona Bondarenko / Kateryna Bondarenko defeated Victoria Azarenka / Shahar Pe'er, 2–6, 6–1, 6–4\nMixed doubles.\n Sun Tiantian / Nenad Zimonjić defeated Sania Mirza / Mahesh Bhupathi, 7–6(7–4), 6–4\nJuniors.\nBoys' singles.\n Bernard Tomic def Yang Tsung-hua, 4–6, 7–6(5), 6–0\nGirls' singles.\n Arantxa Rus defeated Jessica Moore, 6–3, 6–4\nBoys' doubles.\n Hsieh Cheng-peng / Yang Tsung-hua defeated Vasek Pospisil / César Ramírez, 3–6, 7–5, [10]–[5]\nGirls' doubles.\n Ksenia Lykina / Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova defeated Elena Bogdan / Misaki Doi, 6–0, 6–4\nWheelchair.\nWheelchair men's singles.\n Shingo Kunieda defeated Michaël Jérémiasz, 6–1, 6–4\nWheelchair women's singles.\n Esther Vergeer defeated Korie Homan, 6–3, 6–3\nWheelchair men's doubles.\n Shingo Kunieda / Satoshi Saida defeated\n Robin Ammerlaan / Ronald Vink, 6–4, 6–3\nWheelchair women's doubles.\n Jiske Griffioen / Esther Vergeer defeated Korie Homan / Sharon Walraven, 6–3, 6–1\nWheelchair quad singles.\n Peter Norfolk defeated David Wagner, 6–2, 6–3\nWheelchair quad doubles.\n Nicholas Taylor / David Wagner defeated Sarah Hunter / Peter Norfolk, 5–7, 6–0, [10]–[3]\nSeeds.\nThese were the seeds for the 2008 Australian Open.\nOn the women's side of the draw, all of the world's top thirty-two players were present; whereas in the men's draw Tommy Haas and Guillermo Cañas were both forced to withdraw due to injury.

        "text": "Charlotteville Cycling Club is a cycling club in Guildford, southern England. The club incorporated in 1903, saw a national record broken in 1934 by Harry Ferris and organises the Guildford Town Centre Races, which have taken place since 1984.\nHistory.\nThe first cycling club in Guildford was in the early days of cycling in 1877, when the high bicycle (the penny-farthing) was in vogue. It began as Guildford Bicycle Club and changed name to Guildford Cycling Club. The club lasted 35 years, by which time the members were middle-aged, middle-class and due to the start of motor manufacturing, automobile enthusiasts.\nNew location and club.\nIn the meantime, working men in much of Guildford wanted a club that would cater for them. Charlotteville an area on the north-eastern side of Guildford, was funded by a wealthy doctor, Thomas Sells. The estate, including small parks, was laid out by the Guildford architect Henry Peak, beginning in 1862, and named after Sells' wife, Charlotte. Charlotteville Cycling Club was formed at Charlotteville Institute in Addison Road on 27 March 1903. The mayor was the first president.\nRise of domestic racing.\nCharlotteville has been racing since its first club event, a 25-mile time trial, in 1905. However, racing in Guildford goes back further, to when Harold Crooke of Guildford CC won the first Anchor Shield in 1886 at races in Woodbridge Road. This trophy was provided by the landlady of the Anchor in Ripley, a venue for cyclists. The races were organised in conjunction with a Southern Counties Cyclists' camp in Shalford Park. Two years later, Crooke took the national high bicycle 100 miles record.\nProgress in international racing.\nIn the Charlotteville, Vic Jenner rode for Britain in the world championship road race in Italy in 1932. Then in 1938 and 1939, George Nightingale gained the 25 and 30-mile records and became the second person to beat the hour for 25 miles in Britain. Derek Cottington took the 25 and 50-mile straight-out records in 1970 and won the 25 and 50-mile championships in 1971.\nTime trials for members had been run since 1905, but in 1928 the Charlotteville promoted its first open event, an evening track meeting, the first of an annual series. After the war in 1946, track promotion was renewed with the Whit Monday meetings at Woodbridge Road.\nOne of the Charlotteville's promotions was the World's Championship Trials at Brooklands Motor Racing Track in 1933. The motivation was Jenner's experiences in Italy. This was the birth of modern road racing.\nCurrent activities.\nThe Club's membership comprises people of all ages and abilities who enjoy all aspects of cycling from time trials and road racing to the members of the club's Go-Ride club (called the Charlotteville Rascals) for under-16s.\nThe Club now promotes several Open racing events through the season, the most important being the Guildford Town Centre Road Races. The club also promotes a series of club time trials which are held in the Pirbright area.\nThe club organises rides for beginners and experienced rides every Sunday. These depart from the Old Guildfordians Clubhouse in Stoke Park at around 09:00.\nClub members meet on the 1st and 3rd Fridays of the month at the Old Guildfordians Clubhouse. These social evenings are open to all, so if you're interested in joining or finding our more about the Club, come along for a drink and a chat.\nGuildford Town Centre Races.\nThe Guildford Town Centre Races were first promoted by Charlotteville Cycling Club in 1984 as part of Guildford Festival which it remains. The route was the same as it is today, a small circuit of North Street, Market Street and a climb of the cobbled High Street. The first race was attended by 2000 spectators. Southern Veteran-Cycle Club Ripley Section rode two laps on veteran machines. The oldest was a French Michaux velocipede of about 1868. There were also two high “Ordinaires” of about 1880 and a Singer solid-tyred safety of 1890.\nThe Town Centre Races were the idea of Les Smith, Mike Willimott and Stuart Campbell who promoted them for the first ten years. Since 1984 the races have been cancelled in 1995, 1999 and 2000 due to roadworks or builders’ scaffolding on the road.\nColours.\nClub colours are red, green and white. \nThe club jersey design has changed many times and the design shown here is for 2011 and was based on an initial design by Roger Morgan that was produced as part of the previous design iteration process."

He has been a major voice on 850 KOA radio in Denver for nearly 30 years, and in 2016 was the key on-air figure when iHeartMedia launched the radio station Denver Sports 760.\nAs of 2022, Logan had coached more than 30 seasons of high school football. He is the only high school coach to win 10 titles with 4 different schools. In 2021, he was inducted into the National Federation of State High School Associations Hall of Fame.

        "text": "Major League Baseball 2K8, or, in shorter terms, MLB 2K8, is an MLB licensed baseball simulation video game co-developed by Blue Castle Games (PS3 and Xbox 360 versions only) and newly renamed 2K Los Angeles (the PS2, PSP and Wii versions are solely developed by 2K Los Angeles with 2K China co-assisting with the Wii version) and published by 2K Sports for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, Wii, and Xbox 360. It was released on March 4, 2008. A demo was released on Xbox Live Marketplace the next day on March 5 for Canada, United States, and Asian markets and features the 2007 World Series opponents.\nNew features.\nBen Brinkman, in a January 18, 2008 \"KOXM\" podcast, revealed the following new features to debut in \"2K8\":\nThe official site also included these additional new and updated features:\nCover athlete.\nThen-New York Mets shortstop José Reyes was announced as the cover athlete on December 6, 2007, taking over for New York Yankees counterpart Derek Jeter from the previous three games.\nAnnouncers.\nFor the 4th straight and final year, announcers Jon Miller and Joe Morgan once again resume game announcing duties, while Steve Physioc and Jeanne Zelasko continue reporting duties.\nLicensing issues.\nBarry Bonds is once again not placed in the game due to his not being a part of the MLBPA licensing agreement, and once again is represented by left-fielder Joe Young, whose name is a reference to Hall of-Fame 49ers quarterbacks Steve Young and Joe Montana. Some people have also said that Randy Carter is representing Roger Clemens on the free agents list.\nThe game is also notably missing some regular every day MLB players like Kevin Millar and Brendan Donnelly. This is due to the players' involvement in crossing picket lines as replacement players during the 1994 work stoppage, which prevents them from becoming members of the MLB Players Association. These players do, however, have aliases within the game. For example, Kevin Millar goes by the name Kyle Morgan as evidenced by their identical profiles including number, height, weight and attributes. Higher profile prospects like Jay Bruce (replaced with James Bale) of the Reds, Evan Longoria (replaced with Eric Lincoln) of the Rays, Colby Rasmus (replaced with Clint Rents) of the Cardinals or Fernando Martínez (replaced with Felipe Marrero) of the Mets are also under aliases in the game until they have major league experience while players like Geovany Soto of the Cubs are in the game. These aliases use the same first initials of the player's first and last names, and mirror the players actual profiles and attributes as well. New rookies from the Japan Leagues, Kosuke Fukudome of the Chicago Cubs and Hiroki Kuroda of the Los Angeles Dodgers do not have their names in the game and are instead replaced with Kazuhito Fortunato and Hideo Kajita. Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Kyle Drabek, is replaced with the name Kirk Darby, although at the time, he was on the Philadelphia Phillies.\nDS spin-off.\nA more \"baseball-lite\" version of \"MLB 2K8\" was released for the Nintendo DS called \"Major League Baseball 2K8 Fantasy All-Stars\", which extensively utilizes the DS touchscreen, and features fantasy elements such as power-ups and fantasy stadiums.\nDevelopment and history.\n\"MLB 2K8\" represents the third seventh generation console baseball game of the \"2K Sports Major League Baseball\" series, and the second lead developed by Ben Brinkman for 2K Los Angeles. In Brinkman's \"1UP.com\" log, he revealed that \"MLB 2K8\" represents the middle act of a planned three year development cycle for 2K's baseball series for next gen systems, with \"MLB 2K7\" being the first stage. According to Brinkman, \"\"At the same time we set out a three year plan for the MLB franchise so that once 2K7 ended we could get right to work on 2K8 and have a set of goals and features to accomplish.\" From an interview in an IGN article, \"MLB 2K7 was the first step in a long process of reinventing the 2K Sports baseball brand and the MLB franchise. 2K7 was year one of that, and a lot of that was just getting back onto stable ground -- getting back with the people who play our game and putting something out there that they're happy with, they have a blast playing and that they can play for an extended period of time. I think we delivered upon that, especially given the short timeline with which we had to create that game.\"\"\nSoundtrack.\nThe following songs appear in the soundtrack:\nReception.\nThe PlayStation 2 version received \"generally favorable reviews\", while the rest of the console versions received \"mixed or average reviews\", according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, where the PS2 and PS3 versions were ported and published by Bethesda Softworks on November 13, 2008, followed by the Xbox 360 version on November 27, \"Famitsu\" gave the Xbox 360 version a score of three sixes and one five.\n411Mania gave the Xbox 360 version a score of 7.7 out of 10 and said, \"2K needs to step things up next year, there’s no doubt about that, but they're on the right track judging by the year-to-year improvements. Stomp out the bugs and glitches, get the framerate under control, spruce up the graphics, and update the commentary and maybe it'll be a serious challenge for The Show next time around. If you're a baseball nut with an Xbox 360, this is the only game in town and definitely worth a look. If you've got a PS3 though, MLB 2K8 probably isn't winning the pennant.\" \"USA Today\" gave the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions a score of seven out of ten and stated that the game \"boasts enough control innovation to merit an upgrade over last year's installment, but bugs in future releases could mean a trip to the bench.\" However, \"Maxim\" gave the same two console versions six out of ten and said, \"Like the Yankees, \"2K8\" has all the necessary ingredients to be a champion—great graphics, an eclectic soundtrack, a winning tradition—and yet, in the end, all the parts wind up feeling like they're trying too hard to be great. Like that Choker McA-Rod, the game grounds out in the bottom of the ninth with the bases loaded.\""

        "text": "Rugby Central was a railway station serving Rugby in Warwickshire on the former Great Central Main Line, which opened in 1899 and closed in 1969. The station was on Hillmorton Road, roughly half a mile east of the town centre.\nThe Great Central competed with the West Coast Main Line for traffic to London, which has served the town since the 1830s at Rugby Midland station; since the closure of Rugby Central, Midland station has reverted to its original name of \"Rugby\".\nHistory.\nThe station was opened on 15 March 1899. It had services between and \"via\" , and , as well as various cross-country services to places such as Southampton and Hull.\nThe station was run by the Great Central Railway from 1899 until it was grouped into the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923. It came under the management of British Railways in 1948.\nRugby Central was roughly midway along the Great Central Main Line (GCML) and was a stopping point for express services, as well as a changeover point for local services. Until the early 1960s, the station was served by about six London – Manchester expresses daily, and was the terminus for local services from or to the south, and Leicester Central or Nottingham Victoria from the north. The line was then downgraded, with express services being removed, leaving only the local services and an infrequent semi-fast service to London.\nMost of the GCML was closed on 5 September 1966, following the recommendations of the Reshaping of British Railways report. On that date, the line south of Rugby Central and north of Nottingham Victoria was closed. Until 3 May 1969, the section between Rugby Central and Nottingham (initially Nottingham Victoria, later cut back to ) remained open as self-contained branch, providing DMU-operated local passenger services. The station formally closed on 5 May.\nDesign.\nRugby Central was built to the standard Great Central design with a single island platform, long. The booking office was at street level, built onto the side of the road bridge over the railway with the platform below. The platform was accessed by a covered staircase from the booking office. On the platform were three waiting rooms and a toilet block, which was the only building not covered by the canopy.\nOn the heritage Great Central Railway in Leicestershire, the preserved station is a similar design to the former Rugby Central.\nRemains.\nThe station buildings were demolished after closure, but the platform still exists and is open to the public: The station site, and 4.5 miles of the former Great Central Railway trackbed through Rugby, are now owned by Rugby Borough Council, who bought them in 1970 for £5,500. The trackbed runs mostly through cuttings, and it is now used as a footpath, cycleway and nature reserve called the Great Central Walk.\nThe former goods yard was west of the station and was used as a timber yard until the mid-1990s, when houses were built on it.\nReopening proposals.\nIn August 2000, Chiltern Railways suggested reopening the former Great Central Main Line between and Rugby Central to a parkway station in Leicestershire near the M1/M6. The proposal is a \"secondary aspiration\" of Chiltern's franchise agreement. However, Chiltern stated in 2013 that the plan is \"no longer active\". In recent years, proposals to reopen the railway line as an alternative route to HS2 have been proposed, and in 2015, opponents of HS2 called for the GCR to be reopened as an alternative.\nIn October 2017, English Regional Transport Association proposed reopening the line from Calvert to Rugby with a new link to Nuneaton as part of a West Coast relief line."

It is a spin-off of the \"Klonoa\" game series, and has the distinction of being the last game Namco published for the PlayStation. Its release was limited to Japan and Europe, with the European release notably featuring the characters speaking in multiple languages, such as English, Spanish, French, Italian and German.

In the championship mode, players choose a team of their choosing and make their way through a beach volleyball tournament that consists of five rounds. In the penultimate match, it is revealed that Garlen, the host of the tournament, intends to take over all sports resorts unless the player's chosen team happens to win. Winning the last match allows the player to watch an ending sequence featuring the leader of their chosen team as the credits roll.\nGameplay-wise, \"Klonoa Beach Volleyball\" plays just like a proper 2v2 beach volleyball game, with the goal being to keep the ball in the air and return it to the other side of the net.

        "text": "North Enfield Cricket Club is a cricket club in Enfield, Greater London.\nHistory.\nNorth Enfield Cricket Club has been in existence for 127 years. Initially playing at Claysmore - farmland located between Clay Hill and Whitewebbs Park until World War II interrupted much local sport. The current ground at Strayfield Road, only a few hundred yards from Claysmore, is part of Hilly Fields Park, owned by Enfield Council.\nIn 1951/52, the Council agreed to lease the land to the club with the condition that the club own and maintain both the cricket square and the pavilion and car park. A public right of way continues to exist across the middle of the playing area. The club continues to lease the land from the council on a 30-year lease, and is a protected tenant.\nProminent cricketers.\nThe post-war years saw arguably the most talented cricketer ever to play for North Enfield in his prime – Frank Barwick. Barwick won the 1st XI batting and bowling for three years in a row, and the bowling for a further two from 1948, a record unequalled in club history. Barwick joined North Enfield relatively late in his cricket career having previously been at our illustrious neighbours Enfield CC before the advent of war. It is said that had it not been for the 1939-45 conflict, Barwick would have almost certainly played 1st class cricket for Middlesex. He joined North Enfield because, according to club legend, Enfield CC refused to let him have a bat and only wanted him to bowl.\nOther prominent professional cricketers that have associations with North Enfield are Mike Smith of Middlesex and England, whose family was involved at North Enfield for many years, staged a benefit game at North Enfield in 1976.John Emburey, the Middlesex and England spin bowler, who played in the North Enfield Centenary game against MCC and Benefit 1986 and Graham Barlow (Benefit fixture 1983). Middlesex wicket keeper Keith Brown was also a good friend of the Club for many years. Rumours also abound that England leg-spinner B.J.T. Bosanquet also played for North Enfield, (he was born at Bulls Cross and lived locally for some time) but no records exist to confirm this.\nFixtures and events.\nThe club has participated in league cricket in various forms over the years, principally the Saturday Hertfordshire League and the Chess Valley Sunday league from its inception until 2007. The club fields two teams at present - in Divisions 3 and 8 respectively for the 1st and 2nd XIs on the back of promotions for both sides in 2010. A Sunday friendly XI exists for those who prefer their cricket to be of a more relaxed nature. Fixtures take place home and away against teams from across North and East London, Hertfordshire and Essex. Sunday cricket is of a very mixed standard with a ‘give everybody a game’ emphasis (and provision of a good tea also features high on priority lists). In the last few years, the resurgence of 20 over cricket has brought a number of Friday night games at North Enfield, in particular the annual match against Enfield Scouts XI in aid of Help for Heroes. The club pitch may be hired on Friday nights for office or club games. The Colts section continues the excellent work since 2009, and the club is playing U10s matches in 2013."

At the middle of the 2006 Philippine Cup, Miller was traded to the Alaska Aces as part of a big trade with the Phone Pals.\nThis time, Miller's backcourt partner would be Mike Cortez and with them, Jeffrey Cariaso, Sonny Thoss, and Reynel Hugnatan, the Aces took third-place honors during the conference after falling a game short against Purefoods for a finals berth.\nIn the 2006-07 Philippine Cup, Miller led Alaska in numerous categories for the injury-riddled Aces.\nIn the 2007 Fiesta Conference, he led the Alaska Aces with the help of 2007 PBA Fiesta Conference Best Import Rossell Ellis to the championships once again after 5 years. Winning the championship against Talk 'N Text in seven games despite being down 3–2 in the series making it the club's 12th title. He also bagged the PBA Most Valuable Player once again in that season, as well as the PBA Finals MVP.\nIn the 08-09 PBA Philippine Cup All-Filipino Conference, Miller won his second best player of the conference award, leading his team to the best record in the eliminations and eventually to the championship round. There, Miller performed superbly, averaging 15.7 points, 4.6 rebounds, and 6.5 assists and making some clutch plays. In Game 2, with Alaska down 84–89 with less than 7 minutes to play, he sparked a fiery rally, scoring six points in a decisive 16–0 run that eventually won them the game. Miller also played the hero in Game 5, where he scored 15 points, including an emphatic (and somewhat ill-advised) game-clinching three-pointer with 8.7 seconds remaining. However, the Aces lost to the Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters in game seven, with Miller missing two free throws in the final 16 seconds that could have tied the game.\nBarangay Ginebra Kings (2010–2011).\n2010 Fiesta.\nIn the middle of the Fiesta Conference, Alaska traded him to Ginebra in exchange for Cyrus Baguio who wanted to have more minutes. On his debut with the Kings, they lost to his former team. Ultimately, they ended their season in the quarterfinals to the Aces.\n2010-2011 Philippine Cup.\nGinebra amassed an impressive 10-4 card but it was only enough for 3rd place if only Miller did not turned the ball at least once in 3 out of there 4 games they could have avoided Alaska and gain Twice-to-beat Advantage. They will win against Alaska though 2–1 with a come from 0–1 deficit while trailing 20 points in the first quarter in game 3. But Miller was just limited to 2 points in game 1 and 1 point in game 3.\n2011 Commissioner's and Governors Cup.\nAs the season went through, Miller's minutes winded down due to the rising of then rookies John Wilson and Robert Labagala as well as the return of Mark Caguioa's superstar game. Before the start of the playoffs of the third conference, he got traded to the then Air21 Express who were looking for a guard that could help Dondon Hontiveros.\nBarako Bull Energy (2011–2012).\nMiller joined the Air21 Express before the start of the 2011–2012 season. The Express renamed its team to Barako Bull Energy after the sale of the majority share of the Energy Food and Drinks, a subsidiary of Photokina Marketing that exclusively distributed Red Bull Energy Drink to the Philippines to the Lina Group of Companies.\nGlobalPort Batang Pier (2012–2013).\nMiller was involved in the biggest trade during the off-season before the 2012–13 season which sent him first to Barangay Ginebra before landing to GlobalPort.\nBarako Bull Energy (2013–2014).\nHe was back in Barako Bull's arms again after he was traded in the offseason for oft-injured center Enrico Villanueva. His role in the team is more of a mentor to young guards and a voice in the locker room, though he can score and make plays for his teammates whenever he needs to. He was let go by the team after his contract expired last season and is contemplating retirement.\nReturn to Talk 'N Text (2015).\nHe has agreed to terms with the Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters, a franchise he played several seasons for in the past. He won eventually one Commissioner's Cup title with the Texters.\nASEAN Basketball League.\nPilipinas MX3 Kings (2015–2016).\nHe has agreed to terms with the Pacquiao Powervit Pilipinas Aguilas (which was later renamed to Pilipinas MX3 Kings) before the season start, a team which play in the ASEAN Basketball League. He scored 12 points in his ABL debut.\nCoaching career.\nIn November 2023, Miller was hired as an assistant coach of Converge FiberXers.\nInternational career.\nMiller was chosen by head coach Chot Reyes to play for the RP Training Pool in 2005. He played well for the Philippines in the FIBA Asia tournament and participated in the William Jones Cup in Taiwan, when the country finished third. However, Miller played only three games after suffering an injury and was replaced by Denok Miranda.\nIn 2006, Miller played for the team in a Qatar Invitational tournament along with the two-game exhibition against the Lebanon national basketball team.\nIn 2008, he was again included in the RP Training Pool under former coach, Yeng Guiao.\nHe was among the 12 players for Team Pilipinas that played in the 2009 FIBA Asia Championship."

        "text": "Terrence Edward Fox (born July 31, 1935) is an American former right-handed Major League Baseball relief pitcher/closer who played seven MLB seasons from 1960 to 1966 for the Milwaukee Braves, Detroit Tigers and Philadelphia Phillies.\nFox played at Thornton Township High School in Harvey, Illinois, graduating in 1953. Standing tall and weighing , Fox found his way into the Braves organization before the 1956 season. The New Iberia Pelicans (or Indians) of the Evangeline League sent Fox to the Braves in an unknown transaction. He made his big league debut for the Braves on September 4, 1960 at the age of 25 and wearing the number 36, pitching two-thirds of an inning against the Cincinnati Reds. He gave up one hit and walked a batter, but came away otherwise unscathed. He ended up pitching in a total of 5 games for the Braves in his rookie season, posting a 4.32 ERA.\nHe was traded along with Dick Brown, Bill Bruton and Chuck Cottier from the Braves to the Tigers for Frank Bolling and Neil Chrisley. The Tigers would end up getting the better of the deal—although Cottier didn't amount to much with Detroit, Brown and Bruton both had the best seasons of their careers when it came to home run output, but the real gem of the trade was Fox himself.\nIn his first two seasons with the Tigers, he led all pitchers on the team with over 20 appearances in ERA each season with marks of 1.41 and 1.71. Also their main closer those two years, he posted save marks of 12 and 16. His 12 put him at fifth most in the league in 1961, while his 16 put him at third most in the league in 1962. One interesting note about his 1961 season is that he surrendered Roger Maris' 58th home run of that year. Here is the tale, according to BaseballLibrary.com:\nHe again led his team in saves with 11 in 1963, and also posted a respectable 3.59 ERA. He was not the team's leading save-getter in 1964, finishing third on the team with 5 saves. He trailed both Larry Sherry (11) and Fred Gladding (7). His ERA was 3.39.\nHe was again the team's leading closer in 1965, collecting 10 saves. He also posted a 2.78 ERA, which tied him for second among all relievers who had over 20 appearances on the team.\nHis career took a total turn-for-the-worse in 1966. He started the season off with the Tigers, but after posting a 6.30 ERA in the first four games of the season, he parted from them after being sold to the Phillies. In his final 36 games with them that season, he posted a 4.47 ERA. He ended his big league career on September 25, 1966. While with the Tigers he wore number 18. In his short time with the Phillies, he wore 34 and 19. While with the Phillies, he earned $19,000.\nOverall, he went 29–19 in his career with 59 saves and a 2.99 ERA. As a batter, he struck out in 40 of his 65 career at-bats, batting just .123 (3 of his 8 career hits were for extra-bases, though). He committed 7 errors in his career for a .942 fielding percentage.\nBaseball-Reference.com says his career statistics are most similar to those of Minnie Rojas and Chuck Taylor.\nFox has lived in New Iberia, Louisiana."

        "text": "Bryce Taylor (born September 27, 1986) is an American-German professional former basketball player currently working as an assistant coach for the Indiana Mad Ants of the NBA G League. He played college basketball at University of Oregon. In April 2018, he was granted German citizenship.\nTaylor's father Brian Taylor spent 10 years in the ABA and NBA, averaging 18.6 points per game. He was a nine-time ABA All-Star and the 1973 ABA American Basketball association Rookie of the Year.\nHigh school career.\nPrior to arriving at the University of Oregon, Taylor starred at Harvard-Westlake School, where he set a school record by scoring 54 points in a game, as his team won three straight CIF championships.\nCollege career.\nTaylor arrived at Oregon with high expectations, and as a freshman he did not disappoint. Taylor averaged 11.6 points per game and shot 37% from three-point range. Highlights included a then career-high 26 point effort in December against Fresno State, a contest in which he scored the game winner. However, Taylor's sophomore season was a disappointing one as his scoring average dipped to 9.3 points per game.\nKnown primarily as a three-point shooter in high school and his first two years at Oregon, Taylor reinvented his game over the 2006 off-season, establishing himself not only as a slasher but also as a defensive specialist. As a result, Oregon head coach Ernie Kent regularly assigned Taylor to guard the opposing team's best player. Taylor also rediscovered his three-point prowess during the 2006–07 campaign, and is currently connecting on 42.4% from beyond the arc. For his efforts, Taylor was named the team's Most Improved Player.\nDuring the 2007 Pac-10 Tournament Championship game against the USC Trojans, Taylor poured in 32 points, making all 11 of his shots from the field in an 81–57 drubbing. He was a perfect 7 for 7 from the three-point line and 3 for 3 from the foul line in helping Oregon win their second Pac-10 Tournament Championship in the last five years.\nProfessional career.\nTaylor played his rookie season in Italian Lega Basket Serie A for Sutor Montegranaro in 2008–2009. He then moved to German Basketball Bundesliga the following season and played for Telekom Baskets Bonn. In 2010 Bryce Taylor signed a short-term deal with German team Alba Berlin which was extended for the rest of the season. He emerged more and more into a crowd favorite due to his spectacular game. He re-signed for another one-year deal for the 2011–12 season, where he was even voted into the All-BBL Second Team. In the 2012–13 season he played for the Artland Dragons.\nIn June 2013 he signed a two-year deal with Bayern Munich, and helped the club win the 2014 championship. In July 2014, Taylor agreed on a contract extension with Bayern until 2016, including a team option for the 2016–17 season.\nOn June 25, 2017, Taylor signed a three-year contract with Brose Bamberg. Taylor averaged 4.4 points and 0.9 rebounds per game during the 2019-20 season. He parted ways with the team on August 11, 2020. The following day, Taylor signed with the Hamburg Towers.\nCoaching.\nIn the 2021-22 season, Taylor served as Player Development Assistant for the Indiana Pacers in the NBA under head coach Rick Carlisle. In June 2022, he was appointed assistant coach of German Bundesliga side EWE Baskets Oldenburg.\nOn October 4, 2023, Taylor became an assistant for the Indiana Mad Ants of the NBA G League."

        "title": "Nelson (cricket)",
        "text": "Nelson is a piece of cricket slang terminology and superstition.\nThe name, applied to team or individual scores of 111 or multiples thereof (known as double nelson, triple nelson, etc.) is thought to refer to a wicket. Various sources ascribe it to referring to Nelson's three major naval victories (won, won, won), or (incorrectly) to \"one eye, one arm and one leg\" – Nelson never in fact lost a leg or his eye, although he lost the sight of one eye (see the portrait at right). Longtime cricket historian and scorer, Bill \"Bearders\" Frindall once referred to it online as \"one eye, one arm and one etcetera\", implying that Nelson's alleged third lost body part was \"something else\", however this is equally mythical. In the 1939 film of \"Goodbye, Mr Chips\" a schoolboy refers to Nelson in these terms: \"One arm, one eye, one destiny\". Umpire David Shepherd during a radio interview to mark his retirement explained it as \"One arm, one eye and one lump of sugar in his tea.\"\nIt is thought by the superstitious that bad things happen on that score, although an investigation by the magazine \"The Cricketer\" in the 1990s found that wickets are no more likely to fall on Nelson and indeed, the score at which most wickets fall is 0 (a duck). It may be considered unlucky because the number resembles a wicket without bails (a batsman is out if the bails are knocked off their wicket).\nThe New Zealand cricket team Nelson played first-class cricket from 1874 to 1891. In both their first and last first-class innings they were dismissed for 111.\nDavid Shepherd made popular the longstanding practice of raising a leg or legs from the ground on Nelson in an effort to avoid ill fate. When crowds noticed this, they would cheer his leg-raising.\nThe equivalent superstitious number in Australian cricket is 87, or the \"Devil's Number\". Many, including commentators and journalists, think 87 is considered unlucky because it is thirteen shy of 100 however an alternative thought is it came to be known as the \"Devil's Number\" after Ian Johnson was dismissed for 87 while playing grade cricket and Keith Miller commented \"That's funny, I once saw Bradman dismissed for 87\". It turned out that Bradman had actually been dismissed for 89 and the MCG scorers hadn't updated his last two runs before his dismissal; however, the superstition remained. Statistics have shown that more Australian batsmen are in fact dismissed on the numbers surrounding 87.\nIn 1981, during the 3rd Test of the Ashes series at Headingley, Australia were dismissed for 111 in the last innings of the Test, chasing a target of 130. This completed an astonishing turnaround in the match after England had been forced to follow-on after a first-innings collapse (despite the best efforts of Ian Botham, who took six wickets in Australia's first innings and scored 50 in England's), but Botham's second-innings 149* and Willis's eight wickets won the match for England.\nOn 11 November 2011, in a Test match between South Africa and Australia with the time at 11:11 and with South Africa requiring 111 runs to win, the majority of the crowd and umpire Ian Gould did Shepherd's leg raise Nelson for that minute with the scoreboard reading 11:11 11/11/11.\nIn 2015, in the fourth Test of that year's Ashes series, Australia were dismissed in 18 (six-ball) overs and 3 deliveries - 111 legitimate deliveries (there were also three no-balls) – for 60, with Stuart Broad taking 8/15. This was, at the time (and still is) the record for the shortest ever first innings of a Test, at least counting the legitimate deliveries (although Bangladesh's collapse against the West Indies in Antigua, in 2018, lasted 112 legitimate deliveries and contained no no-balls or wides.)\nOn 8 May 2019, in the Women's T20 Challenge in Jaipur, Trailblazers vs Velocity, Trailblazers were 111 for 2, chasing a target of 113. Then they lost five wickets in seven balls for no runs, making the score 111 for 7. However, they went on to win."

        "title": "John Claiborne (baseball executive)",
        "text": "John W. Claiborne III (born 1939) is a former front-office executive in American Major League Baseball who also was an early president of the New England Sports Network (NESN), a regional cable television network primarily (80 percent) owned by the Boston Red Sox that telecasts Red Sox baseball and Boston Bruins National Hockey League games.\nClaiborne's baseball career began with the New York Mets and ended with the St. Louis Cardinals. After starting out in New York's farm system, he was the Cards' administrative assistant for minor leagues and scouting in 1970–72, and the general manager and chief operating officer of the Redbirds in 1978–80. In between, he was the farm system director of the Oakland Athletics in 1972–75 and the assistant general manager of the Red Sox in 1975–77.\nClaiborne ran the A's farm system during the height of the A's dynasty under owner Charlie Finley. Finley served as his own general manager and had a phenomenal degree of success at the major league level with a roster that he had signed and groomed through the player development system. But by the mid-1970s, the talent pipeline began to dry up as Finley economised through slashing the number of scouts and minor league affiliates working on Oakland's behalf.\nIn August 1975, Claiborne resigned his Oakland post. He then joined the Red Sox as a special assignment scout, evaluating West Coast-based teams at the major league level. When Boston won the American League East Division and faced the three-time defending world champion Athletics in the 1975 American League Championship Series, Claiborne's scouting report was a critical factor in Boston's stunning three-game sweep. At season's end, he was promoted to chief aide to Bosox general manager Dick O'Connell.\nClaiborne drew positive notices for his work in the Boston front office, but when longtime owner Tom Yawkey's death forced a sale of the team in 1977, O'Connell and his top assistants, including Claiborne, were fired by Yawkey's widow, Jean, to make way for a new ownership/management team. Reportedly, some of the unsuccessful bidders for the Boston franchise were considering hiring Claiborne as O'Connell's successor.\nLess than a year later, however, Claiborne returned to St. Louis to take over the Cardinals' front office. He ran the Redbirds from the end of the 1978 campaign to the middle of 1980, a period of transition during which the Cardinals hired Whitey Herzog as field manager. When Herzog's hiring on June 9, 1980, did not produce immediate results, he was given additional duties as general manager and Claiborne was fired on August 18 of the same year. Eventually, Herzog would make trades for players such as Ozzie Smith who would lead to St. Louis' three National League pennants during the 1980s.\nClaiborne eventually returned to Boston to serve as president of the fledgling NESN, which has grown to become a powerful regional sports network.\nIn 2002, Claiborne was hired by the Baltimore Orioles as the first ever employee of, and to start \"Orioles Television\", which was the group that produced over-the-air broadcasts of Orioles games, and was the precursor to the current Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN)"

        "title": "Swimming at the 1912 Summer Olympics – Men's 100 metre freestyle",
        "text": "The men's 100 metre freestyle was a swimming event held as part of the swimming at the 1912 Summer Olympics programme. It was the fourth appearance of the event, which had not been featured at the 1900 Games. The competition was held from Saturday July 6, 1912, to Wednesday July 10, 1912. Thirty-four swimmers from twelve nations competed. The event was won by Duke Kahanamoku of the United States, the nation's second consecutive victory in the event (tying Hungary for most all-time). Cecil Healy took silver, the only medal in the event for Australasia, the short-lived joint team of Australia and New Zealand. Another American, Ken Huszagh, took bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the fourth appearance of the men's 100 metre freestyle (including the 100 yard event in 1904 but excluding the Intercalated Games in 1906). The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1900 (when the shortest freestyle was the 200 metres), though the 1904 version was measured in yards rather than metres.\nOne of the four finalists from 1908 returned: bronze medalist Harald Julin of Sweden. Charles Daniels, the defending gold medalist who had also won at the 1906 Intercalated Games and taken silver at the 1904 Olympics, had retired. The favorite was Kurt Bretting of Germany, who had broken Daniels' world record earlier in 1912. An intriguing entrant was the Hawaiian Duke Kahanamoku, rumored to have posted phenomenal times which were unverified because of the distance from the American mainland.\nGermany, Norway, and Russia each made their debut in the event. Hungary and the United States each made their fourth appearance, having competed at each edition of the event to date.\nCompetition format.\nThe rules for the swimming events provided that each event would consist of heats, a final, and \"a sufficient number of intermediate heats in proportion to the number of competitors.\" This led to confusion, as the organizers declared that there should be two intermediate rounds (for a total of four rounds) while the American team believed that there would only be one before the final and consequently did not appear for the semifinals. After some negotiation, a four-round competition was held, with a special heat in the third round for competitors who had missed races due to the confusion.\nFor each round, the top two swimmers in each heat advanced to the next round, along with the fastest third-place swimmer. In the case of a tie, all tied swimmers would advance (swim-offs would only be used in the final). Each race consisted of a single length of the 100-meter course, and any stroke could be used.\nRecords.\nThese were the standing world and Olympic records (in minutes) prior to the 1912 Summer Olympics.\n\"(*)\" 100 yards (= 91.44 m)\nIn the fourth heat Perry McGillivray set a new Olympic record with 1:04.8 minutes. In the fifth heat Duke Kahanamoku bettered the Olympic record of 1:02.6 minutes. Finally Duke Kahanamoku improved the Olympic record with a time of 1:02.4 minutes in the third semifinal heat.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe fastest two in each heat advanced. A tie for second in the seventh heat resulted in both swimmers advancing. In addition, the fastest third-place swimmer from across the heats also qualified for the quarterfinals.\nQuarterfinals.\nAgain, the top two in each heat advanced along with the fastest loser overall. Four of the qualified swimmers did not take part in their quarterfinal heats, and a fifth (Massa) did not appear due to a misunderstanding. Massa was later allowed to take part in the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nFurther confusion struck the semifinals. Under the belief that the second round of the competition had been the semifinals, the American swimmers did not appear for the third round. This led to both semifinals being essentially walkovers, as the first had three swimmers and the second only one. Since the top two swimmers of each and the fastest third-place swimmer would advance, all four competitors had secured a place in the final before entering the water. Longworth swam in the first heat, despite suffering from what the official report referred to as \"suppuration in the head\".\nThe jury for the swimming events met and determined that a third heat should be held under special rules. If the winner of the extra heat were to beat the time set by the third-place swimmer of the first heat (1:06.2, a stiff pace but one which all three Americans had beat during the quarterfinals), he and the second-place finisher would advance. If the mark were not bettered, none of the swimmers from the third heat would advance. Massa, who had missed the quarterfinals due to a misunderstanding, was also allowed to start in the extra semifinal.\nIn the third heat, Kahanamoku not only beat Longworth's time, thus qualifying himself and Huszagh for the final, but bettered his own Olympic record which he had set in the first round. Huszagh out-touched McGillivray by a \"hand's breadth\" to take second place and the final qualification spot, though both finished well behind Kahanamoku and their own previous times. Massa did not finish the race.\nFinal.\nLongworth was unable to continue competing due to illness and did not start in the final.\nKahanamoku was clearly in control by the halfway point, with a tight race between Huszagh, Ramme, and Bretting for the next three spots with Healy close behind them. It was Healy who took the silver medal, though, as he swam by the other three near the finish. Ramme fell back to fifth while Huszagh and Bretting finished separated by \"[o]nly a decimetre\"."

        "title": "The Cricket Annual",
        "text": "The Cricket Annual was a compact cricket annual publication published in 1961 and 1962. This was the final name of a cricket annual that had first appeared in 1895, and was before it was re-named to become the re-styled Playfair Cricket Annual. \nIn 1962 the Playfair titles (including the Playfair Cricket Annual) were acquired by Dickens Press which had just published \"The Cricket Annual\". In November 1962 editor Roy Webber died suddenly and the decision was made to combine the two annuals so that in 1963, Dickens published a new style \"Playfair Cricket Annual\", using the same name but basing the size, format and price on \"The Cricket Annual\".\nBackground.\n\"The Cricket Annual\" was one in a long line of publications starting in 1895, with many different titles but with a continuity of format and style. They are pocket book size (approx 9.8 x 13.6 cm) but pre-1928 inaccurately trimmed and size varies (1906 is 8.9 x 13 cm). Pre-1915 books usually contained 96 pages (1908 = 80). From 1904-1914 they were edited by Alfred Gibson (Rover) and then for one year in 1921 by 'Mentor'. From 1922 until 1939 the editor was Frank Thorogood, in 1946 Percy Rudd, and then Crawford White until 1957 when he was joined by Roy Webber. Good quality copies prior to 1921 are rare and the 1895-1899 \"Star and Leader Cricket Manuals\" is difficult to find in any condition. The early annuals (pre-1914) sold for one penny (1d). When they reappeared after the First World War the price was 4d (1923 2d) and then in 1929 reduced to 3d until 1939. Post-1946, as the number of pages grew, the cost rose in increments from 6d to one shilling and six pence (1/6) by 1957.\nTitles\nDetails.\nEditions produced since 1928:-\nFor editions of the annual 1963-present see the Playfair Cricket Annual."

        "title": "Toronto Golf Club",
        "text": "The Toronto Golf Club is a private golf club in Mississauga, Ontario, a suburban municipality to the west of Toronto. Established in Toronto in 1876, it is the third-oldest golf club in North America, after the Royal Montreal Golf Club and the Royal Quebec Golf Club. The Toronto Golf Club adopted its current name in 1909 and moved to its present location in 1913. The Club has hosted the Canadian Open five times and the Canadian Amateur Championship nine times, more than any other club.\nHistory.\nIt originated on a parcel of land known as the Fernhill property, which was included within the city of Toronto in the 1900s. The original course was located east of Coxwell Avenue between the railway and slightly south of Eastwood Road and then along a narrow area between tracks and north side of Gerrard Street east to Kildonan Road. In 1909, the Club obtained a new charter without share capital, and the original name of the Club, \"The Toronto Golf Club\", was restored. The following year, it was decided to acquire a new site in Toronto Township, now Mississauga. The old course is now a residential area on the south end of East Danforth.\nThe Club is located on the banks of the Etobicoke River, and its 18-hole course was designed by the renowned English architect Harry Colt. The course was ready for play in the fall of 1912, and its clubhouse was completed in 1913. In 1919, the Club bought additional land to the north and had a new nine-hole course built which opened in 1921. George Cumming was hired in 1900, at age 21, to serve as head professional and remained in that position for 50 years. Doug Rankin is the current Head Professional. Hired in 1991, Rankin took over from John Hunt, who was the Professional from 1959 to 1990. Lou Cumming, Professional 1950-59; George Cumming, Professional 1900-50; Arthur Smith, Professional 1895-99.\nTournaments hosted.\nThe Toronto Golf Club has hosted several major events in its history. The golf club was a former rota course of the Canadian Open, hosting the event on five occasions. It hosted the event twice at its original location in Toronto (1905 and 1909), and hosted the event three more times at its current location in 1914, 1921 and 1927. The Toronto Golf Club has also hosted the Canadian Amateur Championship nine times, more than any other club. The golf club played host to the tournament in 1898, 1901, 1903, 1905, 1909, 1913, 1926, 1995, and 2017."

        "text": "Trevor Allan (26 September 1926 – 27 January 2007) was an Australian dual-code rugby international who captained Australia in rugby union before switching to rugby league with English club Leigh.\nRugby union club career.\nA North Sydney rugby union junior, Allan was educated at North Sydney Technical High School. His senior club career was with the Gordon rugby club in Sydney where his father was a coach. Phil Tressider described him as a fine running centre with powerful acceleration once he got outside a rival. His forte was the muscle he would add to a back-line with his fierce tackling. He had strength beyond his years and slight physique. As a teenager he shared an ice-run with one of his brothers and he would haul a 28-pound block of ice on a hook in either hand sometimes climbing three or four flights of stairs to make the delivery.\nRugby union representative career.\nAfter only a handful of senior games, he was selected for New South Wales aged just 19 and later that year for the 1946 tour of New Zealand, the Wallabies' first post-war tour. Allan's defence impressed against the experienced All Black backline.\nIn 1947, he was selected as vice-captain of the Wallaby side to tour Europe and North America. In the sixth game of the tour, in a minor match against London Counties, the captain Bill McLean broke his leg badly and was able to play no further part in the nine-month tour. Allan took over. This was a few days after his 21st birthday making him the second youngest Wallaby captain and the youngest ever touring captain. The Wallabies beat Scotland, Ireland and England but lost to Wales on penalties. They did not have a try scored against them in any of these Tests. Allan returned from the tour having proved both his exceptional leadership and playing capabilities.\nIn 1949, he led the Wallabies to New Zealand where they won the Bledisloe Cup for the first time in New Zealand and posted eleven wins from twelve games on tour. \"The Rugby Almanack of New Zealand\" that year named him one of the world's top 5 players.\nHe missed the Test against the British Lions in 1950 due to injury but coached the Australian side.\nIn all he played 17 matches for the New South Wales Waratahs in his rugby career, he played for Australia in 52 matches of which 14 were Tests. He was captain in 40 of those 52 national appearances, 10 of them Tests.\nRugby league career.\nIn late 1950, Allan signed with English Rugby Football League club Leigh. With the assistance of Australian former rugby league international Ray Stehr he signed a four-year contract with the club worth 5,000 pounds sterling. He made 97 appearances for Leigh in a four-year period, scoring 52 tries. He also represented in a star-studded Other Nationalities side during this time, making him a dual-code international. He returned to Australia in 1955 and played three seasons with the North Sydney Bears, the last two as captain-coach.\nPost-playing.\nAfter retiring he began a long and successful career with the Australian Broadcasting Commission as a commentator on league and union. He was the face and voice of the ABC's rugby union coverage throughout the 1960s and 1970s. He died early in 2007.\nAccolades and honours.\nOn 10 June 1991, he was awarded the Order of Australia Medal and on 23 August 2000, he was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for services to rugby union. He was made a life member of the Sydney Cricket Ground and has been honored there with the installment of a bronze sculpture of his likeness, and a plaque in the Walk of Honour there commemorates his career.\nHis 1947 Wallaby tour teammate Sir Nicholas Shehadie described him as follows: \"I doubt that I ever laid eyes on a better defending centre who also excelled in attack. He performed many try-saving tackles, most memorably in our 1948 Test defeat of England at Twickenham. Few better leaders\".\nIn 2007, the Trevor Allan Cup was created in his honour being a five-round north–south pool competition involving first grade teams from all twelve Sydney clubs, conducted in the second half of the Sydney domestic season after completion of the Shute Shield first grade competition.\nIn 2010, he was honoured in the sixth set of inductees into the Australian Rugby Union Hall of Fame.\nHe is one of six captains to lead his side to a test series win on New Zealand soil, along with Philip J. Nel (1937 Springboks), John Dawes (1971 British Lions), Andrew Slack (1986 Australia), Philippe Saint-André (1994 France) and Johnny Sexton (2022 Ireland)."

The situation is the same today, but of recent years we have had successful ladies and youth teams also.\nToday they have one senior team which is going through a generation change. The team mostly consists of players who have come up through the Spartacus “youth academy” but there is currently a strong foreign contingency within the club, with players from such major rugby nations as England, Ireland, France, New Zealand and Fiji. In early 2006, Spartacus acquired a new coach in the form of Jonas Ahl (who is also coach of the Swedish national ladies team) and with Ahl's expert coaching and guidance, we gained promotion to Allsvenskan, the top league in Sweden.\nColours and Jumper.\nSpartacus wear a red and white hooped jersey (same as the Japanese National Team)."

The native of Shinnston, West Virginia, attended Florida State University. He threw and batted right-handed and was listed as tall and . His brother Larry Brown had a 12-year MLB career (1963–74) as an infielder with four American League teams.\nOriginally signed by the Indians in 1953, Dick Brown made his big league debut on June 20, 1957 against the Boston Red Sox at the age of 22. After three seasons with the Indians, he was traded to the Chicago White Sox on December 6, 1959, along with Don Ferrarese, Minnie Miñoso and Jake Striker for Norm Cash, Bubba Phillips and Johnny Romano.\nBrown caught for six pitchers who would eventually be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. He played in 636 games over nine seasons, hitting .244 with 62 home runs and 223 runs batted in. His best two seasons were the two he spent with Detroit: he hit 16 home runs in 1961 and 12 home runs in 1962. He had a career .989 fielding percentage. Career highlights include back-to-back-to-back home runs he hit with Norm Cash and Steve Boros on May 23, 1961. He hit a grand slam less than one month earlier on April 29.\nHe played his final game on October 3, 1965. He had been expected to continue as the Orioles' starting catcher entering the 1966 season, but the discovery of a brain tumor early in spring training necessitated surgery to remove it on March 7. Additional surgery weeks later revealed another brain tumor, an inoperable one that effectively ended Brown's playing career and cost him his life. He served as a scout for the Orioles until his death at age 35 in Baltimore in 1970. "

        "text": "The Bowling Green Falcons are the intercollegiate athletic teams that represent Bowling Green State University (BGSU), in Bowling Green, Ohio, United States. The Falcons compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division I level as a member of the Mid-American Conference (MAC) East Division. The men's ice hockey team competes in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA); and men's soccer competes in the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC), following the MAC shutting down its men's soccer league at the end of the 2022 season. Bowling Green sponsors teams in seven men's and 11 women's NCAA-sanctioned sports and the football team competes in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), the highest level for college football. BGSU is one of only 15 universities in the United States that plays Division I FBS football and Division I men's ice hockey.\nThe Falcons' main rivals are the Toledo Rockets from the University of Toledo, separated by of Interstate 75 in northwestern Ohio, a rivalry contested in several sports. The best known of these games is the annual football game, known as the Battle of I-75. Originally, the winner of the game was awarded the Peace Pipe, a Native American peace pipe placed upon a wood tablet. Since 2011, the winner is awarded a bronzed I-75 road sign.\nThe 1984 Falcons hockey team defeated Minnesota–Duluth in the longest college hockey championship game in history, to win the NCAA national championship, Bowling Green's first and only Division I national championship.\nSports sponsored.\nBaseball.\nBaseball was founded in 1915 as one of the university's first varsity sports. The program won five MAC championships and four NCAA regional appearances as well as produced 49 Major League Baseball draft picks. After 105 years, the sport was dropped at the varsity level effective immediately on May 15, 2020 as part of the budget cuts due to the on-going coronavirus pandemic. On June 2, 2020, just weeks later, the school announced it was reinstating baseball after they fund-raised $1.5 million dollars of commitments over the next three years.\nWomen's basketball.\nThe Bowling Green Falcons women's basketball team has had a long-standing tradition of success, rivaling only the school's football team as the most prominent athletic team at the university. The women's basketball team has won ten conference tournaments, eleven regular season championships and five division championships. The women's basketball team has made the NCAA tournament nine times and the AIAW tournament (the predecessor to the NCAA tournament) twice, posting an overall tournament record of 6-12. The 2006-07 team became the first women's basketball team from the MAC to reach the Sweet Sixteen after defeating 10th-seeded Oklahoma State 70–60 and upset 2nd-seeded Vanderbilt 60–59.\nThe current head coach of the Falcons is Jennifer Roos. In her first full season as head coach, Roos led the team to the third round of the WNIT. Roos served on the staff of previous BGSU Women's Basketball head coach Curt Miller, who had over 200 wins record in 10 season as head coach. Miller also led the Falcons to five conference tournament championships and six consecutive regular season championships (2005–10).\nFootball.\nThe Bowling Green Falcons football team plays at Doyt Perry Stadium on the east end of the BGSU campus. The Falcons are a historical MAC powerhouse winning ten conference championships, second only to rival Miami (Ohio) (13). Bowling Green has three prominent rivals including Miami (Ohio) and Kent State, but their fiercest rival is Toledo, with the two competing in the Battle of I-75 with the game's winner taking home the Peace Pipe trophy. The Falcons and Kent State also compete for the Anniversary Award which commemorates the two institutions' founding in 1910 with the passing of the Lowry bill. Famous Falcon football players include Kory Lichtensteiger, Shaun Suisham and Don Nehlen (who would also become head football coach at Bowling Green). Notable Bowling Green coaches include College Football Hall of Fame members Doyt Perry and Don Nehlen, as well as Ohio State coach Urban Meyer.\nGymnastics.\nThe Bowling Green Gymnastics team trains and competes in Anderson Arena located within Memorial Hall on campus. Head coach Kerrie Turner is assisted by coaches Sunny Marchand and Juliana Belar. The team is managed by sophomore Alyssa Page and the trainer is graduate assistant Annie Rastovski. The team is to compete at the MAC Gymnastics Conference Championship in Kalamazoo, Michigan after the 2020 competition was cancelled due to COVID-19.\nIce hockey.\nThe Bowling Green Falcons men's ice hockey team is the only athletic program at Bowling Green State University to win a national title, coming during the 1984 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament in Lake Placid, New York. The Falcons defeated Minnesota–Duluth 5–4 in the fourth overtime. The game is the longest NCAA men's ice hockey game ever played. The game was broadcast on WBGU, called by John Bowers. John is now with the Cleveland Guardians. Prominent coaches Ron Mason and Jerry York spent time as head coaches at Bowling Green before leaving for very successful stints at Michigan State and Boston College respectively.\nThe Falcons are currently coached by Ty Eigner, a former Bowling Green player who succeeded Chris Bergeron after the 2018–19 season following nine seasons as an assistant under Bergeron.\nDiscontinued sports.\nElectric Car Racing.\nIn 1993 students at the College of Technology began constructing the Electric Falcon electric race car, and finished it by 1994. The Electric Falcon Motorsports Team won championships in 2001 and 2003. The last year the team raced in the Formula Lightning Racing Series was on October 3, 2004 in Lexington, Ohio, where it competed against nine other universities. The Electric Falcon was donated to the Crawford Auto-Aviation Museum in 2010. The team was briefly restarted in 2011 to compete in the Electric Vehicle Grand Prix. The team placed 8th in 2011, 2nd and 6th in 2012 with two vehicles, and competed in 2013.\nFacilities.\nDoyt Perry Stadium.\nDoyt Perry Stadium is home to Bowling Green's football team. Named in honor of former football coach Doyt Perry, the stadium was opened in 1966 replacing University Stadium. Through 37 seasons, the Bowling Green Falcons enjoyed an impressive 126-58-6 record at Doyt Perry Stadium. The stadium underwent a renovation in 1982 to expand its seating capacity from 23,272 to 30,599. The stadium and MAC attendance record was set in 1983 when 33,527 fans saw Toledo defeat Bowling Green 6–3 in the annual Battle of I-75. The Doyt hosted its first Big Ten opponent on September 6, 2008 as the Falcons were defeated by Minnesota 42–17. The Sebo Athletic Center opened in 2007 and is located at the north end of Doyt Perry Stadium. The 33,500 sq. ft. center was named after J. Robert and Karen Sebo who donated $4.4 million to the project. Sebo Athletic Center is home to sports medicine and rehabilitation centers, strength and training facilities, coaches offices, teaching space for coaches and players, video equipment and viewing room and team meeting rooms.\nStroh Center.\nThe Bowling Green basketball teams and volleyball team moved into a new, state-of-the art convocation center in 2011, replacing the aging Anderson Arena. The new 5,000-seat facility is named the Stroh Center, after Kermit and Mary Lu Stroh who donated $7.7 million to the project. The Stroh Center is also home to the largest falcon statue in the world, a gift from North Carolina philanthropist Irwin Belk. The university broke ground on the Stroh Center on September 3, 2009, a few hours prior to the football team's season opener at nearby Doyt Perry Stadium.\nSlater Family Ice Arena.\nSlater Family Ice Arena is home to Bowling Green's men's hockey team. Opened in 1967, the arena is located on the east end of campus across from the Student Recreation Center. The University had planned to renovate the arena in 2009, but has since postponed the upgrades due to the current economic situation. The arena was renamed in 2017.\nSteller Field.\nWarren E. Steller Field was the home to the Falcons baseball team from 1964 to 2020. The field is named in honor of Warren E. Steller, a former instructor at the school who coached the school's football team from 1924 to 1934 and the baseball team in 1925 and again from 1928 to 1959. The stadium is located on the Bowling Green campus, next to Slater Family Ice Arena and across the street from Perry Field House.\nOther facilities.\nMickey Cochrane Stadium is home to the Bowling Green's men's and women's soccer teams and is located behind the Slater Family Ice Arena. Opened in 1966, the stadium was renamed on October 11, 1980 in honor of Bowling Green's first men's soccer coach. The stadium was renovated in 1993 and 1994, which included the installation of a permanent grandstand that seats 1,500.

Thurmond, whose number 42 is the only basketball number retired by the university, graduated in 1963 before eventually being named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History. Bowling Green also was the collegiate home to one of the NBA's first ever draft picks, Chuck Share, who was selected by the Boston Celtics in the 1950 NBA Draft. Former NBA players Antonio Daniels and Keith McLeod also played at BGSU. Most recently, Richaun Holmes was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers in the second round of the 2015 NBA draft.\nBGSU's hockey team perhaps has provided the school with the greatest number of notable athletes. Two of its players were on the \"Miracle on Ice\" U.S. hockey team that captured the 1980 Winter Olympics gold medal: Ken Morrow and Mark Wells. Rob Blake also captured a gold medal for his country as Canada took up the top prize during the 2002 Winter Olympics. Two Falcons have also won the Hobey Baker Award, given to the top collegiate men's hockey player each season: George McPhee (1982) and Brian Holzinger (1995). In 1984 the Bowling Green Hockey Team won the National Championship in one of the longest games in college hockey history. Gino Cavallini scored at 7:11 in the 4th overtime to give the Falcons their first college hockey national championship. Also advancing to the NHL was retired Atlanta Thrashers defenseman Ken Klee.\nOmar Jacobs was the starting quarterback for Bowling Green in 2004 and 2005. In 2004, he passed for 4,002 yards and set the NCAA record for TD to INT rate, at 41 touchdowns to 4 interceptions. He entered the 2005 season as a Heisman trophy candidate, but was unable to duplicate the success of 2004 and missed two starts due to injury.\nDon Nehlen played and coached at BG. He played quarterback for BG during his playing days before coaching the Falcons for nine seasons from 1968-1976. Nehlen went on to coach West Virginia University where he would receive national attention. The coach joined the College Football Hall of Fame in 2005. Doyt Perry is another Hall of Fame coach who led the Falcons from 1955 through 1964. The university's football stadium is now named in his honor. More recently, Urban Meyer coached the Falcons for two seasons in 2001 and 2002 before leaving for the University of Utah. Meyer, whose last coaching job was with the NFL's Jacksonville Jaguars, has won three college championships—two at Florida in 2006 and 2008, and one at Ohio State in 2014.\nOther notable football players include Phil Villapiano and Shaun Suisham. Villapiano was an integral part of the Oakland Raiders in their glory days during the 1970s as a 4-time Pro-Bowler. Suisham is the kicker for the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nDave Wottle was an NCAA champion and All-American at Bowling Green before graduating in 1973. He won the gold medal in the 800 meter run at the 1972 Summer Olympics.\nOrel Hershiser pitched at Bowling Green before having a dominant career with the Los Angeles Dodgers.\nClub sports.\nStudents at Bowling Green also have the opportunity to participating and compete in various sports at the club level. Club sports do not offer scholarships that varsity sports offer and are operated by the Department of Student Life.\nRugby.\nThe Bowling Green State University Rugby Football Club has been one of the more successful college rugby clubs in the United States. Established in 1968, the club has over 80 members and fields five teams. The club has been embraced by the University as a quasi-varsity sport, with a home game fan attendance that makes it the fourth most watched sport on campus. The club averages nine wins for every loss with an all-time record of 1771-369-83. BGSU RFC became the first Bowling Green athletic program (varsity or club) to compete outside of North America, touring England (1987, 1995, 2012, 2014), Wales (2000), South Africa (2002, 2007), and Ireland (2005). BGSU RFC plays their home matches on the College Park Rugby Field on the corner of North College Avenue and Poe Road with an occasional game at the BGSU football stadium.\nBowling Green Rugby has won 36 consecutive Mid-American Conference titles, eleven Ohio Collegiate titles, eleven Michigan Collegiate titles and has received eleven National Collegiate Championship bids. \nSix Falcons have received All-American honors including: Chuck Tunnacliffe (1986), Tony Konczak (1988), Wes Harmon (1991), Scott Hogg (2003) and Rich Hines and Nick Viviani (2008). Two Falcons have seen call ups to United States national rugby union team by Tunnacliffe in 1991 and Vince Staropoli in 1999.\nBowling Green finished ninth at the 2010 Collegiate Rugby Championship, a tournament broadcast live on NBC. Bowling Green's Rocco Mauer was the leading try scorer and the MVP of the tournament. Mauer signed a professional contract in 2012 to play full-time for the US national team. Bowling Green reached the 2014 D1-AA national playoffs, notching wins against Iowa State and Missouri, before losing to Arizona in the semifinals.\nBowling Green finished second at the 2016 USA Rugby Fall National Championship losing to Notre Dame College (Ohio) 39-17. Bowling Green's center Adam Regini and Scrumhalf Mitch Sora were named as a D1AA Fall Top 50 Backs. While Phil Bryant was not only named as a D1AA Fall Top 50 Forward, but also as the Fall 2016 MVP Forward.\nBowling Green won the Fall D1AA Rugby National Championship in 2018, beating Saint Joseph’s University 26-7. The win capped off the 50th anniversary season of BGSU Rugby.\nPageantry.\nBefore 1927, BG teams were called the Normals or Teachers. Ivan Lake (’23) suggested the nickname after reading an article on falconry. Lake, managing editor and sports editor of the \"Sentinel-Tribune\" in Bowling Green at the time, proposed the name change because it fit headline space and because falcons were \"the most powerful bird for their size and often attacked birds two or three times their size.\" Bowling Green's athletic teams have been known as the \"Falcons\" ever since.\nSchool colors.\nThe historical story behind how BGSU began using brown and orange as its school colors dates back to 1914. Homer B. Williams, the university's first President, gathered a group of people which included a L.L. Winslow from Industrial Arts as a selection committee for the school's new colors. While on a trolley to Toledo, Dr. Winslow sat behind a woman wearing a large hat adorned with beautiful brown and orange feathers. Dr. Winslow was so interested in the color scheme of the pair that he convinced the committee to approve the combination of brown and orange.\nSchool songs.\nBowling Green State University has three common songs that can be heard being played by the Falcon Marching Band at various athletic and academic events. These three songs are the Alma Mater, \"Forward Falcons\" which is the school's fight song, and \"Ay Ziggy Zoomba\" which is played to hype up the crowd at events, which is more familiar to most students, alumni, and fans.\nMascots.\nFreddie and Frieda Falcon are the mascots for Falcons athletics. The pair are anthropomorphized peregrine falcons. They are somewhat of a rarity among collegiate mascots, being one of the few male-female mascot pairs in existence. In 2006 they were both named \"Best Collegiate Mascot\" at the 2006 NCA Cheer Camp in Nashville, Tennessee at Vanderbilt University. Freddie first appeared at Bowling Green sporting events in 1950. Frieda made her first appearance in 1966, but did not become an official mascot until 1980.\nSICSIC.\nSICSIC are a six-member, anonymous pep squad and the official spirit crew for BGSU, which began in 1946. SICSIC members adorn Halloween masks throughout their time with the organization and remain anonymous until the final home hockey game of the member's senior year, where they are unmasked in front of the student body.\nBGSU Athletic Hall of Fame.\nAny former BG student-athlete out of school for at least 10 years, a coach, or a contributor to BGSU athletics is eligible for induction into the BGSU Athletic Hall of Fame. Athletes who leave school early are not eligible to be placed on the ballot until 10 years after what would have been their senior year.\nPortraits of each of the over nearly 200 inductees are on display in the lobby of the BGSU Stroh Center.\nBG's 1984 NCAA championship squad was inducted in 1993 as the first \"team\" ever named to the Hall of Fame."

        "text": "Edward \"Danny\" Green (November 6, 1876 – November 9, 1914) was an American professional baseball player. A center fielder/right fielder, he played in Major League Baseball from 1898 through 1905 for the Chicago Orphans (1898–1901) and Chicago White Sox (1902–05). Green batted left-handed and threw right-handed. He was born in Burlington, New Jersey.\nIn an eight-season career, Green was a .293 hitter (1021-for-3484) with 29 home runs and 423 RBI in 923 games, including 552 runs, 124 doubles, 65 triples and 192 stolen bases.\nGreen reached the majors in 1898 with the Chicago Orphans (later the Cubs), spending four years with them before moving to the Chicago White Sox. Green became the regular Orphans center fielder in 1898, replacing the moody Bill Lange, who retired at the height of his fame to get married. Green hit .304 for the Orphans during four seasons, including a career-high .313 in 1901. But when the American League owners started to offer lucrative contracts to unsatisfied National League stars, Charles Comiskey landed Green, who became the White Sox right fielder in 1902. In his first two years with the Sox he hit .312 and .309. A fast and smart runner, from 1900 to 1904 he averaged 30.2 stolen bases in each season, with a career-high 35 in 1902. Then, before the 1906 season he suffered a throwing arm injury and was outrighted to the American Association.\nGreen died in Camden, New Jersey just three days after his 38th birthday. While Green's family always insisted he died of complications from a beaning, the book, Death At the Ballpark reveals Green most likely died from complications of syphilis. "

        "text": "The North Macedonia men's national basketball team () represents North Macedonia in international basketball and is controlled by the Basketball Federation of North Macedonia. They joined FIBA in 1993, after they gained independence from Yugoslavia. That same year the national team played their first official match against Estonia. Prior to 1993, Macedonian players took part on the Yugoslavia national team.\nMacedonia debuted in their first international tournament at the EuroBasket in 1999. They have appeared five times at the event overall, with their top performance coming in 2011, finishing in fourth place.\nHistory.\nBefore 1991, Macedonia was a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, with players from Macedonia being part of the Yugoslavia national team. First match was in 1945 when Macedonia finished 4th. The first match was in 1945 against Croatia finishing 27-29. The team had mostly played matches against teams from other republics of federation and was represented by Macedonian players under the traditional red, color.\nEuroBasket 1999.\nAfter qualifying for EuroBasket 1999, the national team was placed in Group A, along with FR Yugoslavia, France and Israel. The first game Macedonia came out firing showing solid competitive play against the French Team, however, eventually lost by a narrow margin of 67–71. Next up, was Group A favorites FR Yugoslavia, showing superior play with their post up offense, Macedonia lost 68–83. With the final game of the group Macedonia played a fairly even match, however, luck was not on their side, losing 82–84. Even though Macedonia lost all 3 of their matches to be eliminated, the team showed heart and talent with their impressive play against France and Israel. Due to their small margin of the losses Macedonia ended the tournament ranked as 13th overall.\nEuroBasket 2009.\nEuroBasket 2009 was the first EuroBasket tournament that Macedonia qualified for in a decade. Macedonia was placed in Group A, along with Greece, Croatia and Israel. Macedonia began the tournament with a brutal 54–86 loss to rivals Greece, but rebounded with an 82–79 victory over Israel. Despite dropping their last match against Croatia, the Israel result was enough to secure second round qualification. In the second round, Macedonia was placed in Group E alongside France, Germany and Russia. Macedonia lost to France in the second round opener, but famously defeated Germany in the next game. Against Russia, Macedonia was narrowly defeated by a score of 69–71. This performance was not enough to secure a berth in to the knockout round. Nevertheless, Macedonia considers this as a historic success for the national team, since it was only the country's second appearance at the EuroBasket and the team advanced past the first round. In the final tournament rankings, Macedonia ranked 9th place with a record of 2–4.\nEuroBasket 2011.\nThrough the qualifying round, Macedonia qualified for EuroBasket 2011 and was in Group C along with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Montenegro, and Finland in the preliminary phase. The national team lost their first match to Montenegro 65–70 in overtime but won the remaining four against Croatia 78–76, Greece 72–58, Finland 72–70, and Bosnia and Herzegovina 75–63. Macedonia finished first in the group and advanced to the second round.\nIn the second round, Macedonia was in Group F with Russia, Slovenia, Greece, Georgia, and Finland. Having beaten Greece and Finland in the preliminary round, Macedonia went in to the second round with a 2–0 record. After beating Georgia 65–63, Macedonia qualified for the knockout round. The team then beat Slovenia 68–59, but lost to Russia by 2 points 63–61 after Sergey Monya made a buzzer-beating shot to win the final game of the second round. Macedonia, therefore, finished second in Group F.\nFor the first time in the national team's history, it reached the knockout stage where it defeated host country Lithuania 67–65 by 2 points in the quarter-finals. Macedonia then lost to the eventual champion Spain 92–80 in the semi-finals. They then lost again in the third place game to Russia 68–72 and finished in fourth place.\n2012 Olympic qualifying tournament.\nBy finishing in 4th place at EuroBasket 2011, Macedonia qualified for the 2012 FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament. They were drawn into Group D along with Angola and New Zealand. In the first game against Angola, Macedonia came out non-aggressive in the 1st half falling to a 13 pt deficit 40–53 at halftime. During most of the match, the top Macedonian players showed fatigue due to the grueling playoff matches they had played for their club teams. In addition, Macedonia came out with a strong 4th quarter, eventually losing by a margin of 4 points, with the final score being 84–88 Angola. Top scorers for Macedonia against Angola were Pero Antic with 17, and Bo McCalebb with 21. On the next match day, which was the day after with less than 24 hours of rest, Macedonia came out a lot stronger in the 1st quarter with a strong lead that carried over the entire game. Eventually, New Zealand could not recover, and fell to Macedonia with a final score of 84–62. Leading scorers for the game were Todor Gecevski with 16, Antic with 17, and McCalebb with 23.\nThe Macedonian players got much needed rest before the quarterfinals, which would begin two days later on 6 July 2012. The team, following the 68–64 victory by New Zealand over Angola, won Group D and its opponent in the quarterfinals was to be the Group C runner-up, Dominican Republic. Macedonia lost the game 86–76, though the team had a 13-point lead at halftime. The lost eliminated the national team from qualifying for the 2012 Olympic Games.\nEuroBasket 2013.\nBy participating at the 2012 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament, Macedonia qualified for EuroBasket 2013 in Slovenia. In a disappointing campaign, Macedonia did not manage to repeat the success from the previous Eurobasket, having one victory in five matches in their preliminary Group B against Serbia 89–75, which was good enough only for the last place in the group stage and 21st overall. The first game of the Eurobasket against Montenegro was particularly demoralizing, as the Montenegrins won 81–80 in controversial fashion, after the referees didn't call interference on the basket during Gjorgji Čekovski's last second game winning attempt, despite the fact that one of the Montenegrin players got his hand trapped in the net. Macedonia's best performers were once again McCalebb and Antić, with 17.6 and 13.8 points per game, respectively. After the tournament, several of the Macedonian veteran players, led by captain Pero Antić, announced their retirement from the national team.\nEuroBasket 2015.\nAt the EuroBasket 2015 there were not high expectations for Macedonia, due to their poor performance at their last EuroBasket appearance in 2013. In their first match against Greece they were thoroughly manhandled throughout as they were defeated 65-85. Looking for their first victory heading in to their second match of the tournament they went up against the Netherlands.

        "text": "The 2002 Masters (officially the 2002 Benson &amp; Hedges Masters) was a professional invitational snooker tournament held at the Wembley Conference Centre, London from 3 to 10 February 2002. It was the 28th edition of The Masters, a Triple Crown event, and the penultimate invitational event in the 2001–02 snooker season. It followed the 2001 Scottish Masters and preceded the 2002 Irish Masters. Sponsored by the cigarette company Benson &amp; Hedges, the event featured the top 16 from the snooker world rankings and two wild cards. The competition had a total prize fund of £650,000, with £175,000 going to the winner.\nPaul Hunter was the tournament's defending champion and qualified for the final with victories over Stephen Lee, Peter Ebdon and Alan McManus in the preceding rounds as Mark Williams reached the same stage by defeating Mark King, Stephen Hendry and Jimmy White. Hunter defeated Williams 10–9 (ten to nine) to win the second of three Masters titles. Ronnie O'Sullivan compiled the tournament's highest break, a 138 , in the fourth frame of his first round match with Joe Swail.\nOverview.\nThe Masters is an invitational snooker tournament that was first held in 1975; the top-16 players from the snooker world rankings as well as a sponsors' selection entrant and the Benson and Hedges Championship victor invited to participate as wild cards for the 2002 competition. It is one of the three Triple Crown events in the game of snooker; the others being the World Snooker Championship and the UK Championship, but it is not a ranking tournament. As an invitational event, it carried no world ranking points. The 2002 Masters was its 28th staging, and the penultimate World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) invitational event of the 2001–02 season, following the 2001 Scottish Masters and preceding the 2002 Irish Masters. It was held from 3 to 10 February 2002, at the Wembley Conference Centre, London, England.\nSponsored by the tobacco company Benson &amp; Hedges, it had a total prize fund of £695,000, with £190,000 going to the winner, and the host broadcaster was the BBC. Every match was played as best-of-11 , except for the final which was the best-of-19 frames. World champion Ronnie O'Sullivan was installed as the favourite by bookmakers to win the tournament. Stephen Hendry, the six-times Masters champion, commented on his prospects of a seventh title: \"There is no doubt that this is one of the most difficult tournaments to win. For the players it is second only to the Embassy [World Snooker Championship] in terms of prestige. But I feel I have certainly got as good a chance as anybody.\"\nPrize fund.\nThe breakdown of prize money for the 2002 Masters is shown below:\nTournament summary.\nQualifying.\nThe Benson and Hedges Championship held at the Towers Snooker Club, Mansfield from 4 to 15 November 2001 determined a wild card qualifier for the Masters. Players ranked outside the top 16 in the world rankings were allowed to enter. Ryan Day qualified for the final with victories over Steven Bennie, Drew Henry, Paul Davies, Stuart Bingham, Ian McCulloch, Lee Walker and Sean Storey, where he played Hugh Abernethy, who defeated Ian Sargeant, Dominic Dale, Nick Dyson, Anthony Davies, Mark Gray and Shaun Murphy. Day became the competition's first Welsh winner since 1995 when he beat Abernethy 9–5 to enter the Masters and won £5,000 prize money for winning. Murphy compiled a maximum break in frame two of his 5–2 Last 32 win over Adrian Rosa, the second of his career, the second of the season, the fourth in tournament history and the 44th overall. At 19 years and 3 months, Murphy was the second youngest player to achieve a maximum break in professional snooker.\nRound 1.\nThe first round, in which the two wild cards and those ranked 15th and 16th participated, took place from 3 to 4 February. Fergal O'Brien, the 2001 runner-up, overturned a 2–5 deficit to the sponsor's wild card selection Steve Davis and took the final four frames to win 6–5 with a match-high of 97.

Paul Hunter, the reigning Masters winner, came from 2–3 behind the 2001 LG Cup victor Stephen Lee to win 6–3 with breaks of 101, 69 and 69; Lee accumulated 32 points in the last four frames. John Higgins, the 1999 Masters champion, lost the first two frames to fellow Scot Alan McManus but won the next four to lead 4–2. McManus went 5–4 ahead with breaks of 50 and 102 before Higgins' 78 break in frame ten forced a final frame decider. McManus won the final frame on the brown for a 6–5 victory after Higgins went the brown trying to escape from a . Higgins did not attend the compulsory press conference because he was upset with his form. 1984 Masters winner Jimmy White led Matthew Stevens 5–0 before the latter stopped a whitewash with a 73 break in frame six. White won frame seven and the match 6–1 with breaks of 32 and 36 overturning Stevens' 53–0 lead in that frame. O'Brien played two-time Masters runner-up Ken Doherty, with O'Brien leading 4–0 before Doherty won three frames in a row to be 4–3 behind. O'Brien claimed frames eight and nine to win 6–5.\nHendry took 138 minutes to whitewash Day 6–0 with breaks of 89, 60, 103, 91 and 84 and accumulated 572 points to Day's 120. Asked whether he was sympathetic to Day, Hendry replied, \"Why? Marcus Campbell didn't feel sorry for me. You just want to destroy an opponent. That's how it's always been with me.\" World number 7 Peter Ebdon came from 1–4 behind world number 14 and tournament debutant Graeme Dott to produce breaks of 124 and 84 in claiming five frames in succession and winning 6–4 in 3 hours and 56 minutes. 1998 Masters champion Mark Williams took 1 hour and 53 minutes to defeat world number 13 Mark King 6–1, including a clearance of 127 in the fourth frame and breaks of 58, 40 and 48; King stopped a whitewash by winning frame two on 55 break. O'Sullivan played Joe Swail in the last first round match. Tied at 1–1, O'Sullivan produced a break of 50 in frame three and a 138 in frame four to lead 3–1. Swail claimed the following two frames to tie at 3–3, including a 109 century break in frame six. O'Sullivan made breaks of 87, 77 and 108 to win the match 6–3, compiling 284 points to Swail's 11 in that time.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were held on 7 and 8 February. The first quarter-final was between McManus and O'Brien. Trailing 2–0, O'Brien won four frames in a row to lead McManus 4–2 as he had the match-high break of 59. McManus went on to win four frames in succession to win by 6–4 in a match lasting 4 hours and 12 minutes. Both players commented they had sub-par performances during the match. Ebdon and Hunter played the second quarter-final. Hunter led 3–1 with a break of 54 and a century break of 105 in the fourth frame but the match was required to conclude with a final frame decider as both players shared the next five frames. A break of 80 from Hunter in the final frame gave him a 6–5 win. Hunter said he had the knowledge that he would play Ebdon for a long period of time, adding: \"I played well to go 3–1 up and I scored well when I was in the balls all night. I knew he would come back at me but I just concentrated on playing the balls as they were.\"\nO'Sullivan and White contested the third quarter-final. A crowd of 2,403 people observed the play, the record for a non-final Masters game. O'Sullivan led 3–1 with breaks of 51 and 50, extending it to 5–2 by winning three of the next four frames. White went 5–4 behind following errors in O'Sullivan's play; he came from 35 points behind the latter who went in-off on that score to compile a 72 clearance in frame ten and force a final frame decider. O'Sullivan led the final frame 49–19 but a missed safety shot on the red allowed White to achieve a clearance ending on the blue ball and win the match 6–5. O'Sullivan commented he was quite angry because he lost a game he felt he could have won, \"It's disappointing. The wheels have come off though there is nothing wrong with my game, it's just something I have got to deal with mentally and it's not something I want to air in the press.\" The last quarter-final was played by Hendry and Williams. After five frames, Hendry was 3–2 ahead with breaks of 70 and 85 before Williams levelled at 3–3. Hendry retook the lead with a break of 79 in frame seven before Williams took the next three with breaks of 80 and 50 to win 6–4.\nSemi-finals.\nBoth of the semi-finals occurred on 9 February. The first semi-final was contested by Hunter and McManus. Ahead 2–1, Hunter failed to pot the pink to win the fourth frame, allowing McManus to achieve a clearance from the 14th red to the black to tie at 2–2. McManus made breaks of 56 and 98 to go two frames ahead before Hunter took the next three frames to lead 5–4. The tenth frame was secured by McManus to require a final frame decider won by Hunter with a break of 36 for a 6–5 victory. It was McManus' 34th career semi-final and did not advance to the final of a competition for the first time since the 1999 Thailand Masters. Hunter said he was happy to qualify for the final because McManus was a decent participant. McManus said would not dwell over his defeat and wished Hunter the best of luck for the final.\nWhite and Williams played the other semi-final. A break of 78 won White the first frame while Williams took the next three with breaks on 51, 93 and 102 to go 3–1 ahead. White claimed frame five as Williams took the sixth and then the seventh on a clearance of 133 to be within one frame of victory. White won frames eight to ten to require a final frame decider. During the concluding frame, White a red into the bottom , allowing Williams to clinch the frame 70–24 and the match 6–5. Williams said that White had recovered \"really well\" and the last frame put a plethora of pressure on both players but noted his form against Hunter had no meaning for the final. He commented on the crowd: \"It was difficult to concentrate when someone in the crowd starts whistling while I'm trying to take a shot.\"\nFinal.\nThe final between Hunter and Williams was held over two as the best-of-19 frames on 10 February. This was the first meeting between the two players since the 2001 Champions Cup earlier in the season and the final was their highest ranking match since the 2000 Grand Prix where Williams beat Hunter 5–3 in the quarter-finals. Williams had won all six matches against Hunter with a combined total of 30–9 in frames won. The referee for the final was Jan Verhaas of the Netherlands. Williams won the first frame with a break of 79 and the following three to go 4–0 ahead. In the fifth frame, which lasted 35 minutes, Hunter gave away 24 points in fouls to Williams' 20 before Williams won the frame 82–79 on a clearance from the to the black. Williams broke down on a 56 break in frame six, allowing Hunter to win the frame on the pink. Hunter claimed the seventh frame with breaks of 32 and 69. The eighth frame saw Williams end on a 56 break after missing the 13th red by undercutting it to a top corner. This enabled Hunter to produce a 36 clearance completed on the pink to end the first session 5–3 behind.\nOn resumption of the match, Hunter won the ninth frame with a break of 61 and the tenth to level at 5–5 when Williams left the black on the inside of the top-right corner pocket from poor contact. Frames 11 and 12 were shared for a 6–6 score at the mid-session interval. In frame 13, Hunter was 54–24 behind when he obtained two snookers before missing the blue ball to the top-left corner pocket, allowing Williams to claim the frame. Hunter returned the score to a tie with an 84 break in frame 14 and took the lead for the first time in the next following errors from Williams. A break of 45 from Williams again tied the final in frame 16, before Hunter took the 17th frame after the former got stuck in a snooker. Williams secured frame 18 on a break of 72 to force a final frame decider. In the concluding frame, Williams scored 10 points before Hunter's break of 65 secured him a 10–9 win.\nThis was Hunter's second Masters victory in a row; he went on to win the tournament for a third and final time in 2004. He was third player in history after Cliff Thorburn and Hendry to successfully defend the Masters since it was first held in 1975, and the fifth to have won it for a second time. Hunter earned £190,000 prize money for winning the event; his earnings for the campaign increased to £324,600, moving him past Higgins for the lead of the seasonal money list. He commented on the victory: \"I'm so happy to have won the match — especially to retain the title. Only Stephen Hendry and Cliff Thorburn have won it in successive years — so I'm up there with them.\" Williams said of his fifth loss in the final of a tournament extending back to the 2000 Grand Prix: \"I feel sick because that was one I threw away. I know I got close but a defeat like that could well knock me back to square one. I've got to put it out of my mind, but that's going to be tough. The more finals you lose, the less confidence you have.\"\nMain draw.\nFirst round.\nNumbers given in brackets after players names show the competition's 15th and 16th seeds.

        "text": "Cricket World Cup qualification is the process national cricket teams go through to qualify for the Cricket World Cup. The Cricket World Cup is a global event, and qualification is used to reduce the large field of participants from about 100 to 10–14. The qualification process has started as early as almost 7 years before the World Cup.\nHistory.\nFrom the first World Cup in 1975 up to the 2019 World Cup, the majority of teams taking part qualified automatically. Until the 2015 World Cup this was mostly through having Full Membership of the ICC, and for the 2019 World Cup this was mostly through ranking position in the ICC ODI Championship.\nSince the second World Cup in 1979 up to the 2019 World Cup, the teams that qualified automatically have been joined by a small number of others who qualified for the World Cup through the qualification process. The number of teams qualifying for the World Cup changed from event to event. The first qualifying tournament being the ICC Trophy; later the process expanding with pre-qualifying tournaments. Pre-qualifying tournaments were held within the five ICC regional bodies (Africa, Americas, Asia, East Asia-Pacific, Europe), and organized by their respective councils.\nFor the 2011 World Cup onwards, the past pre-qualifying processes were replaced by the World Cricket League, administered by the ICC; and the ICC Trophy became known as the ICC World Cup Qualifier, and this remained the culmination of the qualification process and became the final stage of the World Cricket League competition. The World Cricket League was a series of international one-day cricket tournaments for national teams without Test status. All Associate members of the ICC were able to qualify for the World Cup.\nWhile 12 teams participated in the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier and the top 4 teams qualified for the 2011 Cricket World Cup, at the ICC Chief Executives' Committee meeting in September 2011, the ICC decided on a new qualifying format for the 2015 Cricket World Cup. Two teams from the top tier of the pre-qualifying tournament, the 2011–13 ICC World Cricket League Championship, qualified directly and did not compete in the 2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier, which decided the remaining two places.\nFor the 2019 World Cup, the host and the seven highest-ranked sides on the MRF Tyres ICC ODI Team Rankings as on 30 September 2017 qualified directly for the event proper. The four bottom-ranked sides were joined by six teams from the ICC World Cricket League in the 10-team ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier 2018, and the top two sides completed the 10-team World Cup line-up.\nFor the 2023 World Cup, only the host nation qualified automatically. 32 teams were divided into three leagues—Super League, League 2 and Challenge League—each with different paths to World Cup qualification. The leagues and supplementary qualifier and play-off tournaments also determined promotion and relegation between the leagues from one World Cup cycle to the next. The fourth World Cricket League competition was used for the initial placement of teams into the leagues for the 2023 World Cup qualifying, and has now been abolished.\nTeam performances.\nThe teams that qualified automatically each time, and the performances of the other teams in the final qualifying tournament, are as follows.\nKey:"

        "title": "Priority (fencing)",
        "text": "Priority or right of way is the decision criterion used in foil and sabre fencing to determine which fencer receives the touch, or point, when both fencers land a hit within the same short time-frame (less than 1 second). After this window, if one fencer had already landed a hit, the electrical scoring apparatus would \"lock-out,\" or fail to record, an opponent's subsequent hit, and thus the one fencer to land a hit is awarded the touch. In épée fencing, if both fencers land valid hits at the same time, they each receive a point. Because of this, foil and saber are considered conventional weapons. After a halt, a referee parses what happened into actions, from which it can be determined whether to award a point or not.\nOffensive actions.\nOffensive actions\nCounter-attacks\nOther Offensive Actions\nDefensive actions.\nThe parry is the defensive action made with the weapon to prevent an offensive action arriving.\nPoint in line.\nThe point in line position is a specific position in which the fencer's sword arm is kept straight and the point of his weapon continually threatens his opponent's valid target, which gains right-of-way.\nAttacks on the blade.\nA fencer can 'beat' their opponent's blade as a preparation to make an offensive action (as opposed to hitting their blade as a parry to defend against an opponent's action).\nInterpretation of priority.\nDespite the simplicity of the underlying principles, priority rules are somewhat convoluted, and their interpretation is a source of much acrimony. Much of this acrimony is centered on the definition of attack. According to the FIE rules, an \"attack\" is defined as \"the initial offensive action made by extending the arm and continuously threatening the opponent's target...\". This is explained in the USFA Fencing Officials Commission FAQ: \"Initial\" refers to which fencer starts the action before their opponent does. \"Offensive\" indicates moving towards the opponent. \"Extending\" indicates that the weapon arm is moving away from the body - right of way does \"not\" require a fully extended arm. \"Continuously\" indicates that there is no \"break\" in the attack in which the attacker stops moving forward or holds back their arm. \"Threatening\" indicates that the attacker is in advance-lunge distance and close enough to hit, \"and\" their weapon's point (for foil) or blade (for sabre) are approaching the opponent's valid target.\nThe general consensus is that a useful guide is for the referee to look for which fencer's arm starts straightening first. In practice, referees, especially inexperienced ones, may go for the easy option and give priority to whichever fencer happened to be moving forwards. This is technically wrong, but it is far from unusual. There is also a school of thought, subscribed to by a relatively small minority, that priority should be given to the fencer who was the first to straighten their arm fully. This, again, is out of line with the current rules. The adherents argue that this is the more classical way of doing things, but this claim is dubious, as actual practice decades ago based right of way on which fencer started straightening the arm (not which fencer completed the extension); and the reworded rules conform better to actual, traditional practice which was documented in some older editions of the rules.\nFor example, the 1957 Amateur Fencers League of America (AFLA) rules says\nThe rules do not require that the attack be made with a fully extended arm; in fact, there are outstanding international champions in foil and sabre who attack without extending the arm fully. However, in all cases, the attacker must clearly take the initiative in combat by threatening the defender's target with a forward movement of the weapon, whether by extension of the arm or a movement of the body or a combination of both. The classical schools of fencing recommend the extension of the arm on the attack because this method simplifies the task\nof the President of the Jury in many situations, as for example in the case of attacks which deceive the parry (see § 11 below).\nAn attack which has failed (i.e. has missed or been parried) is no longer an attack. Priority does not automatically pass to the defending fencer, and at the moment an attack is over, neither fencer has priority. Instead, priority is gained by a fencer making an offensive action, as is always the case. If the attack was parried, the defender has the right to make a riposte, but it must be initiated without indecision or delay. Alternatively, they may initiate their own attack if the initial attack missed. The fencer making the original attack may also make a new offensive action, a renewal of the initial attack. If the attacker immediately continues their attack in the same line, it is called a remise.\nA parry is a defensive action made with the weapon to prevent an offensive action from landing. In practice, even a light blade contact is often sufficient to prevent an attack from landing, so long as it is not a \"mere grazing of the blades\" (as expressed in the rules). Therefore, it is not necessary for a parry to \"close the line\" (an \"opposition parry\"), though that may be used for tactical purposes. Consequently, foilists often parry with a sharp beating motion which does not necessarily end in a guard position that closes a line. In sabre, according to the FIE rules, \"the parry is properly carried out when, before the completion of the attack, it prevents the arrival of that attack by closing the line in which that attack is to finish\". In practice, sabre referees tend to look at the point of blade contact: contact of a defender's forte with an attacker's foible is generally counted as a parry, whereas contact of a defender's foible with an attacker's forte is incorrectly executed, and priority stays with the attacker. Some fencers refer to a retreat that makes an attack fall short as a \"distance parry\", but this is informal use: an actual parry requires blade contact."

        "text": "Sean Christopher Williams (born September 13, 1986) is an American former professional basketball player.\nEarly years.\nSean Williams grew up in suburban Arlington, Texas, with his mother and stepfather, Audrey and Lawrence Garrett, and his two half-siblings: Myles and Brea Garrett. Myles played football at Texas A&amp;M University and was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 NFL draft. Sean's father, Roland Williams, lives in Houston, Texas. Sean did not play organized basketball until he was 15 years old. He became a local standout in community leagues and eventually began playing basketball for Mansfield High School in Mansfield, Texas.\nCollege career.\nAs a member of the Boston College basketball team, Williams began his career as a standout in the paint. He functioned as an intimidating shot-blocking force for his team. Some basketball games were dubbed the \"Sean Williams Block Party\". Despite having never played an entire season for Boston College (BC), Williams left the university as a leading shot blocker in the Big East Conference and ACC, respectively, during each of his BC seasons. Williams established himself as the nation's top college shot blocker by breaking his own record when he blocked 75 shots in only 15 games during the 2006–2007 season.\nWilliams was dismissed from the Boston College basketball team during his junior year after having been suspended twice during his three-year college basketball career for multiple rules violations, including an arrest for marijuana possession in 2005. During his suspension from BC for one semester during his sophomore year, Williams took classes at the University of Houston.\nProfessional career.\nNBA and NBA D-League career.\nNew Jersey Nets.\nWilliams was selected 17th overall in the 2007 NBA draft by the New Jersey Nets. In February 2009, he was arrested while attempting to attend a BC-Duke game in February 2009 for allegedly violating a no-trespassing order. The police report stated he was belligerent while being arrested, writing obscenities instead of his name on the fingerprint card and trespass warning.\nOn March 16, 2009, Williams was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and criminal mischief after an altercation with the clerk at a cell phone store at Park Meadows Mall in Lone Tree, Colorado, that ended with Williams smashing the store's computer monitor. He did not accompany his team on their flight back to New Jersey and was later suspended by the team for two games.

The Hall was chartered in 1965 by the Canadian Lacrosse Association, and inducted its first class of hall of famers in the following year.\nHistory.\nInduction of new members is made on an annual basis. In 1965, three categories were inaugurated: Field Players, Box Players and Builders. A Veteran category was added in 1997 to preserve the memory of stars of yesteryear, and in 1988, an outstanding Team category was also added. Starting in 2016, the box player and field player categories were merged into the Player category with no distinction made between box and field versions of the sport. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic cancelling the induction dinner that year, the 2020 inductees were inducted into the hall in 2021 along with the 2021 inductees. An Officials category, covering on-floor game officials such as referees, was added for the 2022 induction year. Also added for the 2022 induction process was a National selection committee - to better represent aspects of the sport not previously represented well by the existing Eastern and Western selection committees."

        "title": "Texas Longhorns men's basketball",
        "text": "The Texas Longhorns men's basketball team represents the University of Texas at Austin in NCAA Division I intercollegiate men's basketball. The Longhorns currently compete in the Big 12 Conference.\nThe University of Texas began varsity intercollegiate competition in men's basketball in 1906. The Longhorns rank 17th in total victories among all NCAA Division I college basketball programs and 27th in all-time win percentage among programs with at least 60 years in Division I, with an all-time win–loss record of 1828–1105 (). Among Big 12 Conference men's basketball programs, Texas is second only to Kansas in both all-time wins and all-time win percentage.\nThe Longhorns have won 28 total conference championships in men's basketball and have made 38 total appearances in the NCAA tournament (9th-most appearances all time, with a 40–40 overall record), reaching the NCAA Final Four three times (1943, 1947, 2003) and the NCAA regional finals (Elite Eight) eight times. As of the end of the 2023–24 season, Texas ranks tied for fourth among all Division I men's basketball programs for total NCAA Tournament games won without having won the national championship (40), tied with Kansas State and Notre Dame (40 each), and trailing Oklahoma (43), Illinois (45), and Purdue (49).\nThe Texas basketball program experienced substantial success during the early decades of its existence, but its success in the modern era is of relatively recent vintage. After two losing seasons during the program's first five years, Texas suffered only one losing season from 1912 to 1950, achieving a winning percentage of .703 during that span, reaching two Final Fours and one Elite Eight during the first decade of the NCAA Tournament, and receiving retroactive recognition as the 1933 national champion from the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. From 1951 to 1988, the Longhorns finished with losing records 14 times, recorded a winning percentage of .522, and participated in the expanded Tournament only five times. Texas achieved some measure of national recognition during the tenures of head coaches Abe Lemons (1976–82) and Tom Penders (1988–98), but the program rose to its highest level of prominence under the direction of former head coach Rick Barnes (1998–2015). Barnes guided Texas to 16 NCAA tournament appearances in his 17 seasons with the program, including a school-record 14 consecutive appearances (1999–2012), as well as fifteen 20-win seasons overall and a school-best 13 consecutive 20-win seasons (2000–12).\nThe team now plays in their new home arena, the Moody Center. The team is coached by Rodney Terry, who took over from Chris Beard in December 2022 after the latter was suspended and later fired after being arrested on a domestic violence charge.\nHistory.\nThe early years (1906–36).\n1906–13.\nThe Texas men's basketball program began in 1906 under the direction of Scotland native Magnus Mainland, a graduate engineering student and lineman for the Texas football team who organized, coached, and played on the university's first varsity basketball team. Mainland had been a nationally known basketball player as an undergraduate student at Wheaton College (Illinois) prior to coming to UT. His Wheaton team placed second out of the three competing college basketball teams in the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, the first Olympic Games featuring the young sport (although only as a demonstration sport). Mainland was able to persuade the University Athletic Council to set aside $125 for the preparation of an outdoor basketball court on the southwest corner of Clark Field—the stadium then hosting the Texas football, baseball, and track teams—and to let him organize, coach, and play on the university's first varsity basketball team.\nThe Longhorns took the court for the first time on March 10, 1906, defeating the Baylor Bears 27–17 on their new outdoor home court at Clark Field. Texas traveled to Waco two weeks later for a three-game series with the Bears (also in their first year) and won all three games behind the play of Mainland. The Longhorns ultimately won seven of the eight games scheduled in the basketball program's inaugural season.\nDue to inadequate funding, the UT Athletic Council canceled the fledgling program after two seasons, leaving Texas without a basketball team for the 1908 season. The Athletics Council revived the program in 1909, owing in large part to the efforts of Longhorn player Morgan Vining, who campaigned to raise student interest in the game. Vining was supported in his efforts by the UT student newspaper, \"The Daily Texan\", which consistently advocated for the reinstatement of basketball—in part because the game was viewed as good physical training for football players in the latter sport's offseason. \nLanguage professor, German native, and Longhorn football head coach W. E. Metzenthin (1909–11), who had argued strongly against the cancellation of basketball at UT, assumed head coaching duties for three seasons following the re-establishment of the program. The Longhorns played just 10 of their 27 games under Metzenthin (and only four of their final 18) on their home court, outdoor Clark Field—with its stubbornly uneven surface and total vulnerability to weather conditions—being particularly ill-suited as a basketball venue. Metzenthin finished with an overall record of 13–14; not until 1959 would another UT basketball coach leave with a losing overall record. After Metzenthin relinquished coaching duties following the 1911 season in order to serve as UT Athletic Council chairman (precursor to the athletic director position), former Texas track coach J. Burton Rix—coaching without financial compensation, just as had his two predecessors—led Texas to a 5–1 record in his single season as head coach (1912).\nProfessor Carl C. Taylor, also the Texas track coach, assumed basketball head coaching responsibilities for the 1913 season. Taylor arranged for the rental of the theater of the Ben Hur Temple and its conversion into a miniature basketball court and arena so that his team would have an indoor venue for home games and practice, with UT paying the Shriners and Scottish Rite Freemasons a sum of $75 for the season. Taylor came to UT with a strong reputation for basketball expertise, acquired during his years at Drake University. His Texas team finished with an overall record of 8–4 and, beginning with a 70–7 rout of Southwestern in San Marcos, contributed the first three victories to what would become a national-record winning streak. At the conclusion of the 1912–13 academic year, the UT's \"Cactus\" yearbook declared, \"Basketball is no longer a minor sport at the University of Texas. It always has been so considered until this year Prof. Carl Taylor took charge of the work and infused new life into it.\"\n1914–27.\nL. Theo Bellmont, the first athletic director at The University of Texas—and a man instrumental in the formation of the Southwest Conference—took the reins as head coach from 1914 to 1915, for the first of his two stints leading the basketball team, and directed the Longhorns to 11–0 and 14–0 records in the 1914 and 1915 seasons, respectively, as well as the inaugural Southwest Conference championship during the latter season. Bellmont's teams contributed 25 victories to a winning streak that would ultimately grow to 44 games.\nAfter his teams extended the UT winning streak to 28 games, Bellmont stepped away from coaching to focus on his work as athletic director and appointed Roy Henderson to the still-unpaid Texas basketball head coaching position. Henderson's team recorded Texas' third consecutive undefeated season in 1916 to extend the total to 40 consecutive victories. Senior center Clyde Littlefield, the linchpin of the three consecutive undefeated teams—and a towering figure in UT athletics history who would later coach the football team for seven seasons (1927–33), serve as the head coach of the UT track team from 1925 to 1960 (winning 25 conference championships), and found the Texas Relays—would later receive retroactive recognition as Texas' first consensus All-American in basketball for his play in the 1916 season.\nUT alumnus and former regent Thomas Watt Gregory had begun campaigning a decade earlier for the construction of a permanent gymnasium for the benefit of the student body and faculty—one in which the basketball team would be able to play and practice as well—but fundraising for the $75,000 project had lagged, even more so with Gregory's departure from Austin to serve as the U.S. Attorney General under Woodrow Wilson in 1914. The project was shelved, but the need remained acute, and, following the 1916 season, the UT Athletic Council decided to allocate $8,500 for the construction of the temporary and rudimentary all-wood Men's Gym, which was finished for the second game of the next season.\nTheo Bellmont hired Eugene Van Gent from Missouri in 1916 to lead the Texas football, basketball, and track programs. Van Gent's single basketball team at Texas recorded a 13–3 overall mark and won the Southwest Conference championship for the third consecutive year, with the season highlighted by the first-ever basketball games between Texas and the Texas A&amp;M Aggies, following the resumption of athletic relations between the two schools. The Longhorns began the basketball rivalry with wins in both home games and in one of two games in College Station. Van Gent's 1917 Texas team also added the final four wins to the Texas winning streak that had begun in 1913 before suffering a 24–18 loss to Rice in Austin. Texas' winning streak stood as the NCAA record for consecutive wins in men's basketball for almost 40 years (until Phil Woolpert's Bill Russell-led San Francisco teams won 60 consecutive games from 1955 to 1957), and the achievement today remains the fifth-longest winning streak in Division I history. Van Gent departed after coaching for one season in each sport—winning the conference championship in both—to join the military following the United States' entry into the First World War in April 1917.\nFollowing Van Gent's single year as head coach, Roy Henderson returned to coach Texas for two additional seasons. With several players from the 1917 team having left for military service, the 1918 Longhorn basketball team had only one returning player in sophomore Al DeViney. Henderson scouted talent in the intramural ranks and nonetheless assembled a team that finished 14–5 overall and missed winning Texas' fourth consecutive SWC championship by a single game. Henderson guided the Longhorns to a 17–3 overall record in his final season (1919), splitting the four-game series with the second-place Aggies to win the SWC championship—Texas' fourth basketball conference championship during the five years the conference had existed.\nFrom 1910 through 1919, Texas recorded an overall winning percentage of .789. Only three NCAA schools—California, Navy, and Wisconsin—achieved higher winning percentages for that decade.\nEugene Van Gent was set to return as head coach for the 1920 season but resigned before the beginning of the season to pursue a business opportunity in California. Berry M. Whitaker—who had come to the university to develop and direct one of the nation's first intramural programs, and who would also coach the Texas football team for the next three seasons—agreed to serve as head coach for the season. Texas, with seven returning lettermen and war veterans who had played in 1916 and 1917, was once again expected to contend for the conference championship in 1920, but seven players missed significant parts of the season due to injury and illness. After winning their first five games, the Longhorns lost six of eleven to finish at 10–6 overall—Texas' worst season in nine years.\nTheo Bellmont designated Whitaker as the Longhorn football head coach after the departure of Bill Juneau, and Bellmont himself would assume basketball head coaching duties for two more seasons (1921 and 1922), finishing with a 13–5 overall record in 1921. Bellmont then led Texas to its first 20-win season during his final year. The Longhorns finished 20–4 overall and 14–4 in conference play in 1922. Missing five players to injury and grades in the latter part of the season, including the SWC's leading scorer in Phillip Peyton, Texas nonetheless entered its final game with a chance to win the SWC championship for the first time since 1919. The Longhorns fell short in College Station against the Aggies, then coached by future Texas football head coach and Athletic Director Dana X. Bible, who claimed their third consecutive SWC championship. Bellmont returned to his administrative responsibilities for good following the 1922 season, finishing his basketball coaching career with a 58–9 overall record; his .866 winning percentage remains the highest of any coach in program history.\nBellmont selected football assistant coach Milton Romney as the next head basketball coach—then still an unpaid position. Romney's tenure took an early inauspicious turn when the Longhorns lost at home to Oklahoma A&amp;M, 28–27, after Romney called his top players to the bench with a 14-point lead and nine minutes remaining. The Longhorns again suffered a disproportionate number of injuries, including the loss of two starters to a broken leg and a fractured skull resulting from a motorcycle accident. The protracted selection of E. J. \"Doc\" Stewart from Clemson University as the head football coach created further turmoil and distraction when newspapers reported that he would also be charged with leading the basketball team, thus rendering Romney a lame duck with seven games to play. Texas stumbled to an 11–7 finish, losing four of its final six games, but managing to close the season with a win over Bible's Aggies.\nA medical school graduate, a piano enthusiast, a former sportswriter, a one-time automobile dealership owner, and a veteran football and basketball coach, Doc Stewart quickly became a popular figure across diverse segments of the university population. His oratory eloquence landed him an open job offer from the head of the UT English Department. After having coached the football team to an undefeated season, Stewart turned to implementing an entirely new style of basketball at Texas—one that emphasized ball movement and man-to-man defense and that essentially dispensed with the dribble altogether. Texas entered the season expected to finish third or fourth in conference play behind TCU, Oklahoma A&amp;M, and possibly Texas A&amp;M. Texas opened the season with a one-point win and two four-point wins over Southwestern—an opponent that had lost its previous six games against the Longhorns by an average of almost 20 points—leading to concern in the local newspapers. Contrary to prognostications, Texas opened the conference slate with two wins over Oklahoma A&amp;M and sweeps of six other conference series to reach 14–0 in conference play, securing at least a share of the SWC championship with six games remaining, all away from Austin. The Longhorns next traveled more than 500 miles by train to open a long and bitter basketball rivalry with the Arkansas Razorbacks, then in their first year of competition in the sport, earning four- and 11-point wins in Fayetteville. Despite its unblemished record, Texas was still predicted to lose at least one game to the Aggies in College Station. The Longhorns instead managed 24–14 and 17–11 victories over the Aggies to finish as the last undefeated team in Texas and SWC history at 23–0. Senior guard Abb Curtis would later receive retroactive recognition for the 1924 season as UT's second-ever consensus first-team All-American in basketball.\nSome have speculated that Stewart's devotion to his varied non-athletic interests was the root cause of his football and basketball teams' decline in performance over his tenure. Following the perfect 1924 season, Stewart's next three teams finished 17–8, 12–10, and 13–9. This slide—coupled with his football teams' similar decline in performance—resulted in the popular Stewart's controversial dismissal following the 1926–27 season.\n1927–36.\nExcepting two strong seasons—one particularly noteworthy—Texas maintained this level of relatively unremarkable performance in basketball for the better part of the next decade. Texas won only a single SWC Championship during the next nine seasons—in the exceptional 22–1 season of 1932–33, for which the Longhorns were also retroactively awarded the Premo-Porretta Power Poll national championship (presently unclaimed by UT).\nFred Walker (1927–31) coached the Longhorns following E.J. Stewart's dismissal, producing a 51–30 combined record during his four-year stint as head coach. Walker led Texas to an 18–2 overall record and 10–2 conference record during his second season. He was terminated following the Longhorns' disappointing 9–15 season in his fourth year.\nEd Olle (1931–34), who had played for Texas under Stewart, coached Texas for three seasons after Walker's dismissal, leading the Longhorns to a 22–1 overall mark, a conference championship, and a retroactively awarded Premo-Porretta Power Poll national championship during his second year. During his third year, Olle signaled that he would resign at the end of the season and recommended that freshman team and assistant varsity coach Marty Karow take his place.\nKarow (1934–36) would direct Texas to a combined 31–16 record over his two years as head coach. His relationship with Texas Athletic Director and Longhorn football head coach Jack Chevigny marked by increasing friction, Karow resigned as head coach in the summer of 1936 and was hired shortly thereafter as the baseball head coach for the United States Naval Academy.\nJack Gray &amp; H. C. \"Bully\" Gilstrap era (1937–51).\nPre-war Jack Gray years (1937–42).\nOnly two seasons removed from his senior year at Texas, in which he earned consensus first-team All-American honors, and with only one year as an assistant coach with the Texas freshman team, the immensely popular Jack Gray was hired as the fourteenth Texas men's basketball head coach in the summer of 1937 at the age of 25.\nAfter his first two teams combined for a 24–21 record, Gray's 1938–39 team posted a 19–6 overall mark and won the Southwest Conference championship outright for UT's first basketball conference title in six years. The season featured the then-most anticipated intersectional matchup in school history, as Phog Allen's Kansas Jayhawks came to Austin. The Jayhawks appeared to be on their way to winning the first game until the Longhorns rallied late in the second half for a 36–34 victory. The second game the following night proceeded more in line with expectations, with Kansas winning handily, 49–35. Following the series against KU, Texas traveled to Oklahoma City to compete for the first time in the All-College tournament, which had begun in 1937. The 1939 edition of the holiday tournament featured 32 teams from the Southwest and Midwest. The Longhorns easily advanced through their tournament bracket, defeating Southeastern State College (Oklahoma), Westminster College (Missouri), Kansas State Teachers College, and tournament favorite Baylor before falling to Central Missouri State Teachers College in the championship game, 33–25. Texas began conference play with an upset loss to the Rice Owls before hosting the Arkansas Razorbacks for two games in Austin. The Longhorns won a close first contest, 41–37, before being thoroughly outclassed in the second, falling 65–41. With Texas reeling—having started 1–2 in SWC play, and hosting no conference games in Austin for the next month—the team's goal of ending the conference championship drought was in peril. The Longhorns began a four-game stretch of conference road games with a win over Baylor in Waco before continuing to Dallas to face the SMU Mustangs, who stood at 5–0 in conference play. Gray praised the Mustangs as \"probably the most powerful team in the history of the school,\" and SMU coach Whitey Baccus confidently announced that his team would dispatch the Longhorns. Instead, Texas handed SMU its first defeat of the conference season, 33–27. The Longhorns defeated the TCU Horned Frogs and the Texas A&amp;M Aggies in their remaining two conference road games before winning all five SWC contests in Austin, concluding with a 66–32 rout of the Aggies. With a nine-game conference winning streak, Texas had finished at 10–2 in SWC play to claim sole possession of the SWC championship. The Longhorns were one of eight teams to qualify for the inaugural postseason NCAA tournament, where they fell 56–41 to the \"Tall Firs\" of the Oregon Webfoots (later known as the Ducks), the eventual NCAA champion. Texas lost the West Regional third-place game to Utah State, 51–49.\nHopes and expectations for the 1939–40 team were high, as all but one of the key players returned from the previous season's SWC champion and NCAA Tournament squad. Texas opened the season with seven wins by an average of 18 points (and by no fewer than 11), including two wins over the Texas Tech Red Raiders in a home series that marked the first meetings between the two schools in basketball. Gray was intent both upon raising national recognition of the program and upon toughening his team in the early part of the season for the conference slate ahead, and to both ends he sought to involve the Longhorns in intersectional competition against prominent teams in high-profile venues across the country. Ned Irish, director of Madison Square Garden and a pioneer in the promotion of college basketball in the 1930s, had invited Gray's Longhorns to play Manhattan College as part of a doubleheader that included Southern California and Long Island University. The UT Athletic Council agreed to fund the team's trip to New York for the contest, followed by a stop in Philadelphia to play Temple. In front of 18,425 fans, the Longhorns overwhelmed Manhattan by a score of 54–32, earning the praise of the New York sports media and basketball fans for their speed and the accuracy of their one-handed shooting, which Gray had popularized as a player and continued teaching as a coach. Continuing on to Philadelphia, Texas fell 47–37 to Temple, winners of the first National Invitation Tournament two years prior. Having lost one of two road contests against Arkansas and a road game against SMU in overtime, Texas entered the penultimate game of the season at 18–3 and tied at 8–2 in conference play with the preseason conference favorite Rice Owls—a team that the Longhorns had defeated on Rice's home court earlier in the season, 50–46. In front of a raucous pro-Texas crowd of more than 8,000 fans packed into Gregory Gymnasium, the Longhorns suffered a one-point loss to the Owls, 42–41, to see their hopes of winning a second consecutive outright SWC championship dashed and their chances of even sharing the championship greatly diminished. Another painful defeat followed in the final game of the season, as the Longhorns fell to a 10–11 Texas A&amp;M team in College Station, 53–52, on a long running shot from the Aggies' backup center in the final seconds. Texas finished 18–5 with no invitation to a postseason tournament. The Premo-Porretta Power Poll retroactively assigned the 1939–40 Longhorn team a national ranking of No. 17.\nAfter his next two teams combined for a 28–19 overall record and a 12–12 record in conference play, Gray was notified of his acceptance for duty in the Navy in April 1942, four months after the United States had entered the Second World War. Gray's assistant Ed Price had also left for naval service. Longhorn football assistant coach Howard \"Bully\" Gilstrap was appointed to coach the team for the duration of the war.\nGilstrap as interim head coach (1942–45).\nIn addition to both coaches, three starters from the 1941–42 team had departed for service in the war. Accordingly, expectations for the 1942–43 Longhorns were low. Despite losses of coaches and players that were projected as insurmountable hardships, Texas defied expectations, winning 13 of its first 16 games. Gilstrap credited Gray and Price with encouragement and advice from afar and his players with a degree of cooperation he said he had not seen before. Gilstrap explained, \"There were a lot of things I didn't know about the system, and the boys realized that. They came to the rescue. They've been assistant coaches as well as players. We've just been trying to work it out together.\" After stumbling on a swing through North Texas late in the season with losses to TCU and SMU, the Longhorns concluded the regular season with victories over the Baylor Bears and Texas A&amp;M to win a share of the SWC championship and qualify for the NCAA tournament for the second time. The Longhorns drew the Tournament co-favorite Washington Huskies for their first game. After falling behind by 13 points in the first half, Texas came back to win 59–55 behind 30 points from John Hargis and 15 from Buck Overall to advance to its first-ever Final Four, where it drew the other Tournament co-favorite, the Wyoming Cowboys. It was then the Longhorns who surrendered an early 13-point lead, as the bigger and stronger Cowboys regrouped to win 58–54, on their way to defeating the Georgetown Hoyas 46–34 for the NCAA championship. Texas finished the season with a 19–7 overall record.\nFollowing the 1943–44 and 1944–45 seasons, in which Gilstrap's Longhorn teams posted overall records of 14–11 and 10–10, respectively, Jack Gray returned as head coach with the end of the Pacific War in August 1945.\nPost-war Jack Gray years (1945–51).\nGray took charge of a 1945–46 Texas team that returned only five lettermen—none of whom had ever played under him—and which had very little size, as both forward John Hargis and Robert Summers would be out for the entire season. Little was expected of the Longhorns that season, but Texas managed to win its first seven games. The team's grave liabilities in defense and rebounding against bigger teams were never more evident that year than against defending—and soon-to-be-repeating—national champion Oklahoma A&amp;M (later renamed Oklahoma State University) and its 7'0\" All-American center, Bob \"Foothills\" Kurland. Kurland and the Aggies (later known as the Cowboys) dominated the diminutive Longhorns from start to finish, winning 69–34 in the opening round of the eight-team All-College tournament in Oklahoma City. The Longhorns dropped the second game of the tournament to fellow SWC member Rice, 55–52. The Longhorns opened a new season of SWC play with a road win over TCU. Texas was not expected to fare significantly better in two consecutive games against the towering Arkansas Razorbacks in Fayetteville than it had against Oklahoma A&amp;M. The Longhorns acquitted themselves well in a close loss in the first game, 55–47, but the pre-game prognostications came to fruition the following night, as Arkansas routed Texas 90–63 in the second contest. After having lost four of five games, Texas posted an 8–3 record in its final 11 contests to finish with a respectable mark of 16–7 and a third-place conference finish, significantly exceeding preseason expectations for the undersized 1945–46 team.\nDiscussions had begun about the projected need to build a larger arena for UT basketball team. Longhorn basketball had grown significantly in popularity under Gray and Gilstrap's guidance. Sellouts had not been particularly common during the war years, but the university was growing rapidly, and if Texas basketball continued to achieve success, a looming capacity problem was clearly foreseeable. Football and basketball were growing in popularity nationwide, and a spending and building boom was expected to take place in athletics departments around the country. No specific plans for basketball took shape at UT, but discussions of a larger gym or arena continued over the next three years.\nReturning all but one all but one top player and adding some military veterans and players from the freshman team, Gray's 1946–47 Texas team was thought to have a legitimate chance of winning the SWC championship, along with Arkansas, SMU, and defending SWC champion Baylor. Future Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame member and five-time NBA champion guard Slater Martin and forward John Hargis returned to the team to join guards Roy Cox and Al Madsen, who had returned the previous season. All four men, along with three other of that year's letterwinners, had served in the war. Martin, Cox, and Madsen were dubbed the \"Mighty Mice.\" Though the return of Hargis helped, the Longhorns were again a team not possessed of great size, but they did possess great speed and scoring ability. The Longhorns began the season with four blowout wins, the last and closest coming by a score of 46–34 against the Continental Air Liners of Denver. The game against the Air Liners was the last game Texas would play against a semi-professional team, once a routine component of the nonconference schedule, until the 1955–56 season. Not content to play only overmatched local teams for the remainder of the nonconference slate, Gray wanted to harden his team for the season ahead, and the Longhorns next embarked upon a 10-day, 4,000-mile train trip to face Canisius in Buffalo, Long Island in New York City, and DePaul in Chicago. Texas defeated Canisius 52–46 before traveling to New York for the most-anticipated contest of the trip, the game in Madison Square Garden against Clair Bee's LIU Blackbirds, who were averaging 90 points per game and had recently defeated defending national champion Oklahoma A&amp;M. In front of a strongly pro-LIU crowd of 18,453, the Longhorns upset the Blackbirds, 47–46. Texas next traveled to Chicago to face the DePaul Blue Demons of Ray Meyer, whose team had won the NIT two years earlier, and won the final game of their road trip in a rout, 61–43. Before returning to Austin, the 7–0 Longhorns stopped in Oklahoma City to play in the All-College Tournament. Texas dominated the Missouri Tigers 65–46 before falling to Oklahoma A&amp;M, the two-time defending national champion, in the semifinal by a single point, 40–39. The Longhorns defeated the Oklahoma Sooners in the third-place game the following night by a score of 62–50. Texas was only occasionally challenged during the remainder of the regular season, winning its three remaining nonconference games by 29, 24, and 12 points and seven of its first 10 conference games by 12 or more points (and the first 10 SWC contests by an average of 16.6 points). The Longhorns entered the final weekend of the conference season needing only one win in two games against the second-place Razorbacks. In front of more than 8,000 fans at Gregory Gym, Arkansas led for most of the first game before Slater Martin led a late surge to secure the win and the outright conference championship for Texas, 49–44. The pressure to win the SWC championship thus relieved, the Longhorns easily dispatched the Razorbacks the following night, 66–46, to finish the regular season 24–1 overall and 12–0 in SWC play for their first undefeated conference season since Doc Stewart's 1923–24 team finished 23–0. Texas traveled to Kansas City to face Wyoming in the first game of the NCAA tournament. Four players from each team had been on the 1943 teams that faced off in the Final Four on Wyoming's way to the NCAA championship. Texas trailed until the final minutes of the second matchup, and Martin's long shot with 35 seconds remaining provided the margin of victory, with the Longhorns winning 42–40 to advance to the Final Four for the second time, where they would face Oklahoma. Despite having defeated the Sooners earlier in the season by 12 points, the Longhorns trailed 53–49 in the final minute of their second contest. Texas scored five points to take a 54–53 lead with seconds remaining, but OU scored on a 40-foot shot as time expired to defeat the Longhorns, 55–54. Texas returned to Madison Square Garden to play the City College of New York in the national third-place game prior to the NCAA championship game between OU and Holy Cross (won by the Crusaders, 58–47). Texas defeated CCNY 54–50 to finish the season with 26 wins and two last-second, one-point defeats.\nWith demand for tickets outstripping the seating capacity of Gregory Gym, calls began to grow louder for the construction of a new arena. At the same time, a group of Austin businessmen announced plans for the construction of a 10,000-seat arena adjacent to soon-to-be-built Interregional Highway, the precursor to Interstate 35, and 23rd Street and East Avenue—plans which ultimately did not bear fruit. During the following season, members of the UT Development Board met with several dozen prominent alumni to discuss plans for the construction of a 20,000-seat coliseum, at a cost of roughly $2 million, to be located south of Memorial Stadium. UT architects had already begun to draw up designs for such an arena, but the effort did not progress beyond the planning stages.\nSlater Martin and Al Madsen returned to the 1947–48 Longhorn team, among others, but this team was short on depth compared to the previous season's Final Four team, with only seven players in Gray's rotation. For the first time in six years, freshmen were barred from playing on the varsity team. Texas started the season 6–0—highlighted by a 51–42 win over the Texas Tech Red Raiders and a 51–30 blowout of the LSU Tigers, who proved too slow to handle the speed of another fast and quick Longhorn team—before embarking on another road trip to the Northeast, stopping in New York for the third time in two seasons. In a rematch of the previous season's national third-place game, Texas faced the CCNY Beavers in Madison Square Garden. Texas surrendered an 18-point first-half lead but withstood a late CCNY rally, holding on to win, 61–59. Texas defeated the St. Joseph's Hawks in Philadelphia, 61–57, before returning to Oklahoma City for the All-College Tournament. There the Longhorns defeated the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets by a score of 54–45 and the Alabama Crimson Tide, 40–31, to advance to the title game against Oklahoma A&amp;M. For the second consecutive year, the Aggies defeated the Longhorns by a single point, 32–31, after Bob Harris again provided the winning margin in the final five seconds. Texas opened conference play 5–0, pushing its overall record to 16–1, before suffering three consecutive losses to Baylor, Rice, and Arkansas to see its prospects for defending its SWC crown dashed. The Longhorns recovered to win the second game against the Razorbacks in their weekend trip to Fayetteville, 54–43, to halt the losing streak. By the time of the Longhorns' next contest, against Baylor, the Bears stood at 11–0 in conference play and had already secured the SWC championship. Although Texas could do no better than second place, more than 8,000 fans squeezed into 7,500-seat Gregory Gym to see the Longhorns hand the Bears their only defeat of the conference season, 32–29, after Al Madsen added a layup and a free throw in the final 20 seconds. The win over Baylor landed Texas an invitation to the 1948 NIT with two conference games remaining. (Baylor would go on to advance to the championship game of the 1948 NCAA tournament, where the Bears fell to Adolph Rupp's Kentucky Wildcats in the first NCAA championship game appearance for either program.) Texas narrowly avoided an upset loss to SMU at home before blowing out Texas A&amp;M in College Station, 54–34, to finish 9–3 and in second place in the SWC play. The Longhorns boarded a train for New York the following morning to face the favored Violets of New York University, led by future fourth overall 1948 draft pick, 16-year NBA star, and Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame member Dolph Schayes. Martin and Madsen led Texas to a 43–39 lead with under four minutes remaining—after Texas had trailed by seven points midway through the second half—but NYU tied the game in the final minute and scored the final basket on a long shot with six seconds remaining to win the quarterfinals game, 45–43. The Longhorns finished the season 20–5, marking the first time in program history that Texas had won 20 or more games in consecutive seasons.\nTexas recedes from the national stage (1951–76).\nAfter two losing seasons during the program's first five years, Texas suffered only one losing season from 1912 to 1950, reaching two Final Fours and one Elite Eight during the first decade of the NCAA Tournament. The Longhorns would finish with losing records ten times from 1951 to 1976.\nAbrupt decline (1951–59).\nThurman \"Slue\" Hull was hired as men's basketball head coach prior to the 1951–52 season. In his five seasons as the Texas head coach, Hull led the Longhorns to one Southwest Conference championship (1953–54) and finished with an overall record of 60–58 (.508). He was dismissed following the 1955–56 season after his final two teams produced a combined record of 16–32—easily the worst two-year period in the history of Longhorn basketball to that point. Hull was the first Texas coach since W. E. Metzenthin, who coached the basketball team for three years during the program's first five seasons (1909–11), to finish with a Texas career win percentage below .600.\nFollowing Hull's dismissal, Marshall Hughes was hired as the next men's basketball head coach prior to the 1956–57 season. Under Hughes, the Texas basketball program reached the nadir of its existence. Hughes was fired after only three seasons—each with a losing record, and each worse than the one preceding it—with an overall record of 25–46 (.352) after his final team posted a mark of just 4–20, tying the 1954–55 season as the then-worst in program history and concluding a five-year span of futility in which the Longhorns produced an overall record of 41–78 (.345).\nUneven recovery (1959–67).\nBetween coaches Harold Bradley, hired as head coach in 1959, and Leon Black, who directed the basketball team from 1967 to 1976, the Longhorns played in four NCAA Tournaments, two under each coach, as a result of winning the Southwest Conference five times (three times outright) in 17 years.\nIn Bradley's first season, the Longhorns won the SWC outright to reach the 1960 NCAA tournament, where they fell to the Kansas Jayhawks by a score of 80–71 in the Sweet Sixteen contest. Texas subsequently lost the Midwest Regional third-place game to DePaul by a score of 67–61. Texas finished the season ranked No. 13 in the UPI Coaches Poll, marking the first time that the basketball team had finished the season ranked since the introduction of the AP poll and the Coaches Poll for the 1948–49 and 1950–51 seasons, respectively.\nBradley's 1962–63 team again won the SWC outright and reached 20 wins for the first time since Jack Gray's 1947–48 Longhorns. Texas advanced to the NCAA tournament and defeated the Texas Western Miners by a score of 65–47 in its opening game to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, where the Longhorns fell 73–68 to Ed Jucker's defending two-time national champion and fifth-consecutive Final Four participant Cincinnati Bearcats. Texas would go on to win the Midwest Regional third-place game against future Texas head coach Abe Lemons' Oklahoma City Chiefs by a score of 90–81. The Longhorns finished the season ranked No. 12 in the Coaches Poll.\nThe 1964–65 Longhorns tied SMU for the conference championship but lost the tiebreaker for the conference's NCAA tournament berth and thus did not participate in postseason play. In the following two seasons, Bradley's Texas teams posted overall records of 12–12 and 14–10. Bradley retired following the 1966–67 season. He finished with an overall record of 123–75 (.631) and a conference record of 73–39 (.651) as Texas head coach.\nResumed decline (1967–76).\nWith the hiring of Leon Black prior to the 1967–68 season, Texas entered a period that saw the reversal of most of its progress since the lost decade of the 1950s. Black opened with three losing seasons and one non-winning season before his 1971–72 team finished 19–9, won a share of the conference championship, and reached the 1972 NCAA tournament. The Longhorns defeated the Houston Cougars (who had been approved for SWC membership in 1971, but did not play a conference basketball schedule until 1975–76) 85–74 to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, where they fell to the Kansas State Wildcats by a score of 66–55. Texas also lost the regional third place game 100–70 to Southwestern Louisiana (now the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, branded \"Louisiana\" for intercollegiate athletics), but that game, plus all Ragin' Cajun tournament games in 1972 and 1973, were scrubbed from NCAA records when USL was handed a two-year death penalty in August 1973 (Texas does not count the game as a forfeit win, but as a vacated loss).\nAfter posting a 13–12 overall record in 1972–73, Black's Longhorns recorded three consecutive losing seasons, each with fewer wins and more defeats than the one before. Black's 1973–74 team managed to win the SWC championship outright, even with an overall record of 12–15, and advanced to the NCAA tournament, where the Longhorns fell to the Creighton Bluejays in the first round, 77–61.\nFollowing 10–15 and 9–17 seasons in 1974–75 and 1975–76, respectively, Black resigned from his position as Texas head coach. Black finished with an overall record of 106–121 (.467) and a record of 63–65 (.492) in conference play. Prior to Black, only two Texas head coaches had finished with overall losing records—W. E. Metzenthin (1909–11) and Marshall Hughes (1956–59)—and each had only coached for three seasons. Black coached for nine seasons, only twice finishing with a winning record.\nAbe Lemons years (1976–82).\nFollowing Leon Black's resignation, Texas Athletic Director and Longhorn head football coach Darrell Royal selected then-University of Texas-Pan American and former longtime Oklahoma City University head coach Abe Lemons as his primary target for the open position. Lemons and fellow Oklahoman Royal agreed to a five-year contract worth roughly $30,000 per year, and Lemons was subsequently introduced as the twentieth Longhorn head basketball coach in the program's 72 seasons.\nThanks to his exuberant personality, quick and acerbic wit, and rare quote-making skill, the cigar-smoking Abe Lemons' growing status as a fan favorite anticipated any of his notable accomplishments in basketball at Texas. Though he and his staff inherited two players that would play central roles on his most successful Texas teams in freshman forward and Los Angeles high school player of the year Ron Baxter and sophomore Auburn transfer Jim Krivacs, Lemons was nevertheless assuming control of a moribund program coming off of three consecutive losing seasons, the last of which featured the then-third-most defeats in the history of the program. Lemons was less than sanguine about the Longhorns' prospects for the 1976–77 season. Asked in a preseason media session if he felt his first Texas team to be worthy of a top-twenty ranking, Lemons replied, \"You mean in the state?\" After starting the season with a 6–9 record, Texas managed a six-game winning streak against some of the conference's weaker teams before stumbling to a 1–4 finish over the final five games. Despite Lemons' dejected mood following the final game of the season, a loss to Baylor in the final men's basketball game in Gregory Gymnasium, his first team had posted a four-game improvement in its season record over the 9–17 squad of the prior year, finishing 13–13 on the season.\nNo significant preseason expectations attended the 1977–78 Texas Longhorns, a team that would produce one of the more successful seasons in Longhorn basketball history. After a one-point loss in the opening game against Southern California in Los Angeles, Texas inaugurated the $37-million, 16,231-seat Special Events Center with an 83–76 victory over the Oklahoma Sooners, the first of eight straight wins. Texas lost 65–56 to fifth-ranked, defending national champion Marquette before posting another nine straight victories, including a 75–69 upset of third-ranked and eventual Final Four participant Arkansas, with its famed \"Triplets\" (guards Sidney Moncrief, Ron Brewer, and Marvin Delph). The win over Eddie Sutton's Razorbacks vaulted Lemons' Longhorns to a No. 15 ranking in the Associated Press Poll, Texas' first appearance in the poll since a one-week showing at No. 20 in 1949, the inaugural season of the AP basketball poll. Texas would finish the regular season ranked No. 12 in the AP poll with records of 22–4 overall and 14–2 in conference play, sharing the Southwest Conference Championship with the Razorbacks. Despite the impressive season, Texas saw its hopes of playing in the 32-team NCAA tournament dashed in a two-point loss to Houston in the SWC Tournament Final. Houston claimed the automatic bid to the Tournament, Arkansas received an at-large bid, and the Longhorns were left to accept a bid to the 1978 National Invitation Tournament. Texas would storm through the tournament to reach the NIT Championship Game against the North Carolina State Wolfpack, defeating Temple, Nebraska, and Rutgers by an average of over 17 points in the first three rounds. The Longhorns posted an easy 101–93 victory over the Wolfpack to win the NIT Championship behind 22, 26, and 33 points, respectively, from point guard Johnny Moore and 1978 NIT Co-MVPs Ron Baxter and Jim Krivacs. After the end of the 1977–78 season, Abe Lemons was named National Coach of the Year by the National Association of Basketball Coaches. Lemons remains the only men's basketball coach in UT history to earn National Coach of the Year honors.\nWith its four leading scorers returning, Texas entered the 1978–79 season with a No. 6 ranking in the AP poll and as the near-unanimous favorite to win the SWC championship. The Longhorns struggled early, beginning the season 7–4 and falling out of the AP rankings after a 21-point road defeat to Bill Cartwright and the San Francisco Dons. After another blowout road loss to Texas Tech, Texas regrouped to win three straight road games and 12 of its next 13 games, including a three-point upset of 10th-ranked Arkansas in Fayetteville, a 23-point blowout of Shelby Metcalf's No. 15 Texas A&amp;M Aggies in Austin, and an eight-point win over the 11th-ranked Aggies three weeks later in College Station. During the preceding thirty seasons, Texas had only managed a total of six wins against AP-ranked opponents, and never more than one such victory in a single year. A home loss to 14th-ranked Arkansas was the lone blemish during the 13-game stretch, a game that featured a shouting and shoving episode, famous in SWC lore, between Lemons and Eddie Sutton after Sutton had admonished Texas player Johnny Moore on the court. Police and assistant coaches intervened, but Lemons told the media following the game that if Sutton dared to address his players again, he would \"tear his Sunday clothes\" and \"liquidate his a**.\" Struggling SMU dealt Texas a shocking defeat in the final game of the regular season, depriving the Longhorns of sole possession of the SWC crown and forcing them to share the conference championship with Arkansas for the second straight season. Following a 39–38 loss to the ninth-ranked Razorbacks in the SWC Tournament Final, Texas received a No. 4 seed and a bye to the second round in the 1979 NCAA tournament. Texas fell to No. 5-seeded Oklahoma in the tournament to finish the season with a 21–8 overall record and a No. 15 final ranking in the UPI Coaches' Poll. The Longhorns drew an average of 15,886 fans per home game in 1978–79, a school and Erwin Center record that to this point has not been challenged.\nThe 1979–80 Texas Longhorns returned only one starter, forward Ron Baxter. LaSalle Thompson, 6'10\" center and future Longhorn great, joined the program as a freshman. Texas ended the regular season with an 18–10 overall record and a 10–6 conference record, finishing third behind Texas A&amp;M and Arkansas in SWC play. Passed over by the NCAA Tournament selection committee, Texas received a bid to the 1980 NIT, the last postseason tournament a Lemons-coached Texas team would reach. The Longhorns posted a 70–61 win over St. Joseph's before falling to Southwestern Louisiana, 77–76, in the second round to finish with a 19–11 overall record. Baxter, the 1980 Southwest Conference Player of the Year, finished his UT career as the then-all-time school leader in both scoring and rebounding.\nThe 1980–81 Longhorn team carried little in the way of preseason expectations of success. Even before the season began, the program was embroiled in controversy and turmoil. Lemons had summarily fired assistant Steve Moeller, leading to a caustic public feud between the two men, with each blaming the other for recent disappointing recruiting results. Moeller charged that Lemons' lack of inhibition with regard to public and private criticism of players was damaging the program. Only one of the four players signed in the 1981 class—6'9\" forward Mike Wacker—was considered a coveted prospect. Texas opened with a home loss to Pacific. The regular season's zenith, a two-point win over Arkansas in Fayetteville on January 12, did nothing to reverse the team's downward trajectory, with losses to TCU, SMU, North Texas, Rice following shortly thereafter. The Longhorns stumbled to a 10–14 overall record with two conference games remaining. Lemons' habitual sarcasm and indiscriminately acid tongue, heretofore endearing to fans if not academic administrators, began to draw criticism, with some citing his routinely quippish comments as evidence that he failed to take his team's poor performance sufficiently seriously. Nonetheless, just as Lemons began to face notable fan frustration and criticism for the first time at Texas, his team began an unexpected run of late-season success. Lemons' team managed to win the two remaining regular season games as well as three of four games in the SWC Tournament—including a 76–73 victory over No. 15 Arkansas in the semifinal round—to avoid finishing with a losing record. The end-of-season success quelled discontent for the time being, with fans and commentators pointing to the return of LaSalle Thompson, Mike Wacker, and a healthier and more experienced supporting cast as reason for renewed confidence about the near future and optimism about the program's prospects.\nWhile his teams' records and performance had declined since the 1977–78 season, Lemons was not thought to be in danger of losing his job as he entered the 1981–82 season, the first year for new Athletic Director DeLoss Dodds and Lemons' last at Texas. Preseason expectations had Texas posting improvement over the prior season, but the 1981–82 Longhorns were nonetheless not expected to challenge for Southwest Conference supremacy. Texas began the season unranked, only entering the January 12 AP Poll at No. 19 after winning the first ten games of the season. Consecutive double-digit wins over No. 10 and eventual Final Four participant Houston at Hofheinz Pavilion and No. 9 Arkansas in Austin vaulted Texas to No. 7 in the following poll. An 88–71 nationally televised win over South Carolina the following week moved Texas to No. 5 in the AP Poll, the then-highest ranking in program history. Keyed by the performance of 1982 All-American, national rebounding champion, and eventual fifth overall 1982 NBA draft pick LaSalle Thompson and the much-improved sophomore forward Mike Wacker, the Longhorns had started the season with a record of 14–0, then the program's finest season start in the NCAA Tournament era. Two weeks and five losses later, the Longhorns would drop from the polls altogether. The loss of Wacker to a devastating knee injury in the first half of a 69–59 loss to Baylor, the Longhorns' first defeat of the year, disrupted the team's on-court chemistry and confidence and ultimately derailed the season. Texas would win only two of its final 13 games, finishing the season with a 16–11 overall record.\nOn March 9, eight days after the Longhorns' final game, DeLoss Dodds announced Abe Lemons' firing. Dodds was not specific as to the reasons, vaguely citing a \"series of incidents from this and past years, along with the need for new leadership and direction.\" The news met with surprise and outrage from players and fans. Lemons, who, despite some struggles, had presided over the resurrection of Texas basketball during the preceding six seasons, professed shock. Even with the collapse following Wacker's injury, there had been no indications that his job was in jeopardy. Privately, though, Dodds had faced pressure from important administrators and boosters to dismiss the popular Lemons ever since he had arrived at Texas the prior autumn. A powerful faction of UT officials and donors felt that Lemons was presiding over an undisciplined program and that he had become excessively and irresponsibly outspoken. His refusal to enforce a curfew or to punish players for missing practices, for instance, had already drawn criticism in the past. A lack of academic progress during his time at Texas was another reflection of a shortage of discipline and another cause for embarrassment for UT officials. Only one player that Lemons recruited to Austin graduated during his tenure. Moreover, his sharp-tongued and indiscriminate public insults and criticism of people ranging from UT administrators and faculty to officials and coaches at other schools to SWC administrators and referees had progressively earned Lemons the ill will and resentment of a growing number of people with influence over UT athletics. Lemons remained a popular figure among fans, but his support among administrators and powerful donors had dissipated. Following the end of the season, the UT Office of the President and the Board of Regents directed Dodds to fire Lemons, who had two years at $52,000 per year remaining on his contract. The ousted head coach did not leave quietly, commenting that he wanted a glass-bottomed car so that he could see Dodds' face as he ran him over, and adding, \"I hope they notice the mistletoe tied to my coattails as I leave town.\" Despite the acrimonious parting, Lemons would be invited back to reunions in later years and would eventually be inducted into the Longhorn Hall of Honor in 1994.\nLemons finished with an overall record of 110–63 (.636) and a conference record of 58–38 (.604) as Texas head coach.\nBob Weltlich years (1982–88).\nSecond-year Athletic Director DeLoss Dodds signaled his determination to change the culture of the basketball program, noting that the next Texas head coach would be expected to oversee significant improvements in players' academic progress and off-court discipline and the near-total elimination of contact between players and boosters. Texas players petitioned in support of Barry Dowd, a long-time Lemons assistant, for the vacant coaching position, but Dodds and UT administrators were intent on severing all connections to the Lemons era. Dodds ultimately chose 37-year-old Bob Weltlich, a former assistant coach under Bob Knight at Army and Indiana who came with Knight's recommendation, from the University of Mississippi to serve as the next Texas men's basketball head coach. Dodds and Weltlich agreed to a five-year contract worth $95,000 per year, and Weltlich was introduced as head coach on April 2, 1982. At his first press conference as Texas head coach, Weltlich remarked that \"titles are won with good character—and not characters\"—a statement many took to be a swipe at the way Lemons had run the program.\nNicknamed \"Kaiser Bob\" by Longhorn fans for his harshly disciplinarian approach, Weltlich was almost immediately faced with such a manpower shortage from the departures—both voluntary and involuntary—of so many Texas players that he famously had to press Texas male cheerleader Lance Watson into service during the Longhorns' abysmal 6–22 season of 1982–83. LaSalle Thompson, who was considering bypassing his senior season but was as yet undecided at the time Weltlich was hired, ultimately left for the 1982 NBA draft. More than a dozen Longhorn players would leave the program during Weltlich's first three years, and several would make negative comments about his grueling practices and his reliance on criticism and insults as a motivational tactic upon departing. Some players who remained publicly defended Weltlich and his methods. After the new coach's first season, junior forward Bill Wendlandt commented that he believed he had gained mental discipline that he had previously lacked. Nevertheless, even Wendlandt would leave the program after the fall semester of his senior year.\nOf the 1982–83 Longhorn team's six wins, only three came against NCAA Division I opponents—two in non-conference play against Harvard and UNC Charlotte, and one in conference play against Rice in Austin, 47–45. The Longhorns' 15 losses in the conference regular season came by an average of 22.5 points. The season witnessed Texas's fourth, fifth, eleventh, and thirteenth most-lopsided defeats ever—a 106–63 loss to the No. 4 Cougars in Houston, a 96–59 defeat to Texas A&amp;M in College Station, a 76–43 defeat at the hands of Baylor in Waco, and an 82–48 loss to TCU in Fort Worth. Following the 34-point loss to the Horned Frogs, Weltlich savaged his players in public comments, calling them \"as phony as the day is long.\" Texas ended the season with losses in 17 of its last 18 games and with a 13-game losing streak. The Longhorns' 6–22 overall record and 1–15 mark in SWC play represent what remain the most total and conference losses incurred in one season in program history.\nWeltlich's next three teams posted yearly improvements in overall records, although the 1983–84 Longhorns did so by the margin of a single game over the prior year, finishing the season 7–21. Texas managed four wins against Division I competition, with a 62–61 road win over Utah in non-conference play, to end a 21-game road losing streak, and three wins against conference competition—two against Baylor and one over Rice. The Longhorns were also generally more competitive in their many defeats, with their 13 SWC losses coming by an average of 15.0 points, for a one-third reduction in the average margin of defeat from the previous season. Texas played respectably in two losses to eventual second-consecutive national runner-up Houston, losing by 11 to the No. 7 Cougars in Houston and by the same margin to No. 5 Houston in Austin. After trailing 19th-ranked Arkansas 45–27 at halftime in Austin, Texas narrowed the Razorbacks' lead to 68–66 in the final minute before Arkansas added two final points to secure the win. Nonetheless, the 1983–84 season saw a number of particularly lopsided defeats, with a 103–72 loss to SMU and a 74–47 loss to Texas Tech representing what remain the third- and ninth-worst home losses in program history. As fan criticism of Weltlich began to mount, Dodds professed to be \"losing no sleep over basketball at UT\" and said, \"I don't think there's any question that the direction Bob has taken is the right one. No one expected this to be easy.\"\nThough defections would continue for the remainder of Weltlich's tenure, the pace of the exodus had slowed considerably, and the team's roster began to accumulate a semblance of stability, depth, and experience by the start of his third season as head coach. Weltlich stated before the season began that his third Texas would be \"vastly improved\" over the previous two. The 1984–85 Longhorn team would more than double the win total of the previous year's team, posting 15–13 overall and 7–9 conference records. The Longhorns were also significantly more competitive in almost every game they played. Texas lost a hard-fought contest to No. 9 LSU in Baton Rouge in the third game of the season, 87–79, and battled eventual SWC champion SMU closely during the conference season, falling 54–46 to the No. 3 Mustangs in Austin and 64–60 to No. 9 SMU in the second-to-last game of the conference slate. Of the Longhorns' 12 regular-season losses, only two came by margins greater than nine points (with 14 points being the largest margin of defeat). Texas also achieved its first victory over an NCAA Tournament-bound team under Weltlich, defeating Pac-10 Conference champion Southern California in the final game of the regular season, 71–70. The Longhorns were genuinely uncompetitive only in their final game of the year, a 66–46 loss to Arkansas in the SWC Tournament.\nThe 1985–86 team—which finished with a 19–12 overall record and a share of the SWC championship—marked the zenith of Weltlich's tenure at Texas. The Longhorns posted a 3–2 record in their first five games, losing on the road 67–66 to South Alabama and in an 84–62 blowout at Southern California. After a home win over Oral Roberts, the Longhorns traveled to Norman to face an eighth-ranked and 7–0 Oklahoma. Texas pushed the Sooners to overtime and led 90–89 with 28 seconds remaining, but an OU steal and two subsequent scores led the Sooners to a 93–92 win. Weltlich bemoaned his team's decision-making in the backcourt, commenting in the postgame press conference, \"We've lost our last two road games in the last second, and we haven't learned from it.\" Texas returned from Norman at 3–3 to face faced ninth-ranked and 7–0 LSU in Austin. The Longhorns led 35–28 at halftime, but the Tigers recovered to win, 72–65. LSU head coach Dale Brown described the game as his team's most difficult to date and the Texas team as sound in fundamentals. After two more home wins, Texas traveled to Atlanta to play in the Cotton States Classic. After a 35-point loss to No. 7 Georgia Tech in the opening round—in what remains the second-largest margin of defeat in a neutral-site game in program history—Texas posted its third one-point loss of the season in the consolation game against 20th-ranked DePaul, falling 63–62. The Longhorns had again built and then surrendered an early lead, having opened a 10-point advantage over the Blue Demons in the first half. Texas opened conference play with four consecutive wins, including its first win over Arkansas under Weltlich, before falling 55–54 to the Texas A&amp;M Aggies in College Station. After a 63–56 loss to SMU in Dallas, Texas won eight consecutive conference contests, including a 61–57 win over Arkansas in Fayetteville–Texas's first win at Barnhill Arena since 1981–completing Texas's first season sweep of the Razorbacks since 1974. On February 15, Texas recorded its first sold-out home game since Abe Lemons' final year as head coach in a 58–47 win over Texas A&amp;M. The Longhorns suffered their fifth one-point defeat of the season against TCU in Dallas in their penultimate conference game, falling 55–54 as Horned Frog guard Jamie Dixon scored on an off-balance, 30-foot jump shot at the buzzer. Texas followed up the loss to TCU with its sixth one-point loss of the season—and third out of four total losses in SWC games—against Texas Tech in Austin in the conference finale to surrender sole possession of first place in conference play and ultimately share the SWC championship with TCU and Texas A&amp;M. After a semifinal loss to A&amp;M in the conference tournament, the Longhorns were invited to the 1986 NIT—the Longhorns first postseason appearance under Weltlich, and the first since the 1979–80 season. Texas defeated New Mexico in the first round, 69–66, before falling to eventual NIT champion Ohio State in the second round, 71–65.\nThe Longhorns opened the 1986–87 season with a one-point loss to No. 17 North Carolina State, 69–68, and an 80–68 loss to Alaska Anchorage. In its third game of the season, Texas stunned No. 2-ranked and defending national champion Louisville, 74–70, the highest-ranked opponent the Longhorns had defeated in school history. The victory presaged little about the season to come, however, as Texas finished 14–17 overall and 7–9 in SWC contests, for its third losing season in five seasons under Weltlich. Six of the Longhorns' seven victories in conference play came by five points or fewer, while six of the nine conference losses came by 10 points or more.\nFor the first time since the 1974–75 season, Leon Black's second to last as head coach, Texas faced no ranked opponents during the 1987–88 season. Nonetheless, the Longhorns finished 6–6 in non-conference play, losing to all three eventual NCAA tournament participants they faced—falling 100–83 at Iowa State, 80–75 at home to Utah State, and 71–70 at Chattanooga—and losing 86–74 at home to New Mexico, the one eventual NIT participant they faced. Texas suffered its most lopsided non-conference defeat, 85–56, on the road at the hands of a Miami (FL) team that would miss the postseason entirely. Texas posted a 10–6 record in SWC play, tying for fourth place, and lost the first game of the conference tournament to Houston, 72–57. For the fifth time in Weltlich's six seasons, Texas failed to advance to a postseason tournament. Four days after the loss to Houston, Weltlich was dismissed with two years remaining on his contract.\nWeltlich compiled a 77–98 (.440) record during six seasons as the head coach at Texas. None of his six teams managed an appearance in the NCAA Tournament; only the 1985–86 team participated in postseason competition, losing in the second round of the NIT. With the combination of poor overall results and an ultra-slow-tempo style of play that fans found unappealing, attendance plummeted from the lofty marks achieved during the tenure of the popular Lemons to an average of barely more than 4,000 fans per game during Weltlich's final season (far below the turnout for Jody Conradt's Lady Longhorns teams at that time).\nTom Penders era (1988–98).\nHired from the University of Rhode Island on April 6, 1988, to replace Weltlich as the Texas head coach, Tom Penders rapidly revitalized the moribund Longhorn basketball program. Months before coaching in his first game at Texas, Penders set about reviving fan enthusiasm for Longhorn men's basketball. He canvassed the state, speaking to every University of Texas alumni chapter and booster club in Texas. Penders called his team the \"Runnin' Horns,\" and he promised an exciting, fast-paced style of play that would stand in stark contrast to the basketball on display during the prior six seasons. Early on, Penders promised Texas fans, \"We'll run after made shots, missed shots, turnovers, timeouts, TV timeouts, you name it. We'll run and pressure and play 94 feet of defense.\"\nUnlike his entrance, Weltlich's departure did not result in an exodus of players from the program. Penders' first team returned four starters from the previous season, and two talented transfers—Lance Blanks and Joey Wright—gained eligibility, giving Texas a starting five with three future NBA Draft picks and a fourth starter who would play in the NBA. Penders led his first team to a 25–9 overall record, marking the first 20-win season in ten years at Texas and the then-second-highest win total in school history. He quickly validated his promise to bring high-scoring offense to Texas: in the first nine games of the 1988–89 season, the Longhorns scored more than 100 points five times. In Bob Weltlich's 175 games as head coach, Texas had never scored 100 or more points in a game—and had only scored 90 or more points on four occasions (twice requiring an overtime period to reach that mark). The Longhorns opened the season with an 8–1 record before traveling to Oklahoma City to compete in the four-team All-College Tournament. Texas players openly marveled at the wholesale change in coaching philosophy from prior seasons to one that now encouraged them to shoot in large volumes, and some expressed eagerness to see how they would fare against elite competition with their new style of play. Texas defeated the OSU Cowboys 85–84 in the first contest behind 32 points from sophomore guard Joey Wright and two late free throws from junior guard Lance Blanks, who had transferred from Virginia. The win matched Texas in the tournament final against a high-scoring, sixth-ranked Oklahoma Sooners team only nine months removed from a four-point loss as a prohibitive favorite in the 1988 national championship game. Billy Tubbs' Sooners revealed the distance that remained between Texas and college basketball's elite teams, building a 63–37 halftime lead en route to an easy 124–95 win. Texas won six games in conference play by five or fewer points to finish in second place in the SWC with a 12–4 record, with two losses to Arkansas and one loss apiece to Houston and Texas A&amp;M. Interspersed among the conference contests were games against NCAA Tournament-bound Vanderbilt, which Texas lost by a score of 94–79, and Miami (FL), which the Longhorns won easily, 123–104. Texas defeated both SMU and TCU in overtime in the SWC Tournament to advance to the final, in which Arkansas defeated the Longhorns for the third time in 10 weeks. Texas was subsequently selected as a No. 11 seed to play in the NCAA tournament for the first time in 10 seasons, where the Longhorns would defeat the sixth-seeded Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, 76–70, for the program's first NCAA Tournament victory since 1972. Texas fell in the second round to the sixth-ranked and third-seeded Missouri Tigers, 108–89, to end the season at 25–9, a nine-win improvement over Weltlich's final season. The Longhorns' on-court success—in combination with Penders' appealing, fast-tempo brand of basketball and his tireless promotion of the Texas program—produced a rise in average home attendance from the prior season of almost 149 percent (from 4,028 to 10,011), the largest such increase in NCAA Division I basketball for the 1988–89 season.\nFor the 1989–90 season, Texas returned its high-scoring trio of guards, Lance Blanks, 1989 SWC player of the year Travis Mays, and Joey Wright—dubbed \"BMW—the ultimate scoring machine\" by the Texas sports information department and labeled the third-best set of guards in the country by Dick Vitale. Penders' second team finished 24–9 and qualified for the NCAA tournament for the second straight year—a first in Longhorn basketball history—and for only the second time since the Tournament field expanded to 64 teams. Texas defeated No. 24 Florida in Austin, 105–94, in the fifth game of the season for its first win against ranked competition under Penders. The Longhorns would go on to lose their remaining regular-season contests against ranked opponents—to Shaquille O'Neal, Stanley Roberts, and No. 11 LSU in a neutral-site contest, 124–113; to No. 4 Oklahoma in Norman, 103–84; to No. 6 Arkansas in Fayetteville, 109–100, in a game that saw Mays depart in the first minutes due to a finger injury; and, finally, to No. 3 Arkansas in overtime in Austin, 103–96, in a famously bitter defeat that became known in UT lore as the \"Strollin' Nolan\" game. The Longhorns led by one point with 14 seconds remaining when Arkansas head coach Nolan Richardson, after an intentional foul call against a Razorback player, slowly walked off the court to the Arkansas locker room. The SWC officiating crew did not assess a technical foul against Richardson for leaving the court—a decision that the NCAA's chief rules interpreter would label a mistake. Nonetheless, Texas appeared to have the game in hand—leading by three, after Blanks made two free throws—until Arkansas's Lee Mayberry, the national leader in three-point field goal percentage, made a contested 30-foot shot with four seconds remaining to tie the game at 86–86 and send the game into overtime. Richardson then returned to the court, eliciting a resounding chorus of boos from the crowd, and Arkansas outscored Texas 17–10 in the overtime period to claim the win. Two losses to Houston left Texas with a 12–4 record and third-place finish in conference play. The Longhorns added wins against Rhode Island—the team Penders had coached before being hired by Texas—and DePaul during the regular season. Against Rhode Island, Travis Mays surpassed Ron Baxter's career scoring total to become the then-leading scorer in UT history. After their third win that season over Texas A&amp;M in the SWC Tournament, the Longhorns would fall to Houston for the third time, 89–86. At 21–8, Texas was awarded a No. 10 seed in the NCAA Tournament. After an easy 100–88 win over the No. 7-seed Georgia Bulldogs, the Longhorns upset Gene Keady's No. 2-seeded Purdue Boilermakers, 73–72, to advance to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time in 18 seasons. With a come-from-behind 102–89 win against the 28–4 Xavier Musketeers—in which Blanks, Mays, and Wright combined for 86 points—Texas advanced to the Elite Eight for the first time in 43 years to face its SWC archrival, the Arkansas Razorbacks, for the third time that season. Trailing by 16 points with 12 minutes remaining, the Longhorns mounted a comeback that fell just short, falling 88–85 as Travis Mays' last-second three-point attempt came off the rim. Mays finished the season as the Southwest Conference's all-time leading scorer, with 2,279 career points. Texas was ranked No. 12 in the post-Tournament Coaches Poll, matching the 1962–63 team for the highest end-of-season poll ranking in program history.\nMays and Blanks having been selected in the first round of the 1990 NBA draft, the Longhorns entered the 1990–91 season without two-thirds of the Elite Eight team's \"BMW scoring machine.\" Even so, Texas received a preseason AP ranking of No. 22, and Penders' third team finished with a 23–9 overall record, advancing to the NCAA tournament and finishing with 23 or more wins for the third consecutive year. After opening with a win over Florida in Gainesville, Texas fell to No. 20 LSU in Baton Rouge, 101–87, and No. 16 OU in Austin, 96–88. Texas remained ranked until losing to No. 17 Georgia in Athens three weeks later. The Longhorns would defeat Steve Fisher's Michigan Wolverines, 76–74, and fall to a Tournament-bound Arizona State team, 89–82, before beginning conference play. After a 101–89 road loss to No. 2 Arkansas, Texas won ten straight games—nine over SWC opponents and one over DePaul—to Texas resurface in the AP Poll for one week in mid-February at No. 24. Penders finally ended both a personal and program seven-game losing streak to Arkansas in the final game of the conference regular season with the Longhorns' 99–86 win over the No. 3 Razorbacks in Austin, which gave Texas a 13–3 record and second-place finish in conference play. Texas would fall to Arkansas six days later in the SWC Tournament final—the last meeting between the Longhorns and the SEC-bound Razorbacks as conference archrivals. Texas nonetheless ended the season ranked No. 23 in the final AP Poll, for the Longhorns' first appearance in the final AP Poll since the 1978 NIT Championship team, and for only the second time in program history. Texas received a No. 5 seed in the 1991 NCAA Tournament, and the Longhorns would advance from the first round for the third consecutive year before falling 84–76 to fourth-seeded St. John's in the second round, which made 61 percent of its shots—and 71.4 percent of its first-half shots—while holding Texas to just 40 percent in field-goal percentage.\nWhile the departure of Arkansas would hasten the demise of the SWC altogether in the longer term, it immediately consigned the conference—one not regarded as a significant player in college basketball for several decades—to virtual irrelevance in the college basketball landscape. Texas would play just three games against ranked conference opponents—all against the same team, and all occurring in the same season—in the remaining five seasons of the league's existence. Houston was the only remaining program that had resided among the nation's elite in recent years, but the Guy Lewis era had ended six years prior, and UH had only advanced to the NCAA Tournament twice—winning no games on either occasion—since its famed \"Phi Slama Jama\" teams had reached three consecutive Final Fours and two national championship games from 1982 to 1984. Penders' revived Texas program, by default, became the weakened SWC's bell cow, winning or sharing three of the final five SWC championships.\nTexas quickly took advantage of Arkansas's absence, as Penders' 1991–92 team finished with a 23–12 overall record, for his fourth consecutive season of 23 or more wins, and a share of the SWC championship. Although Texas had lost leading scorer and eventual second-round NBA draft pick Joey Wright and first-team all-SWC forward and second-leading scorer Locksley Collie to graduation, the Longhorns added transfer guard and eventual first-round draft pick B. J. Tyler and freshman guard Terrence Rencher, a prolific scorer who would receive first-team all-SWC honors as a freshman and hold several program and conference records by the end of his senior year. The Longhorns opened the season with wins over Washington and Princeton in the Preseason NIT in New York City, before falling to No. 18 Georgia Tech and No. 24 Pittsburgh in the semifinal and third-place games by scores of 120–107 and 91–87, respectively. Texas defeated non-conference opponents Clemson and Georgia over the course of the season, but fell to No. 17 Oklahoma in Norman, 109–106; No. 8 Connecticut in Austin, 94–77; unranked UTEP in El Paso, 92–88; unranked LSU in New Orleans by a score of 84–83; and unranked Rhode Island in Providence by a score of 92–79. The Longhorns nonetheless compiled an 11–3 conference record—losing road contests to TCU, Baylor, and Rice—to share the SWC championship with Houston. Texas defeated Texas A&amp;M and Texas Tech in the SWC Tournament to advance to the final against Houston. Despite having won both regular season games against the Cougars, the Longhorns were uncompetitive in a 91–72 loss in their third contest. Texas was subsequently selected as a No. 8 seed in the NCAA tournament. The Longhorns lost to the Iowa Hawkeyes in the opening game by a score of 98–92, marking the only time in eight first-round NCAA Tournament contests under Penders that Texas would fail to advance to the second round.\nFollowing 95 wins in Penders' first four seasons at Texas—with never fewer than 23 wins in a single season—an injury-plagued 1992–93 season saw Texas struggle to an 11–17 overall record and a 4–10 record and seventh-place finish in the eight-team SWC. Point guard B. J. Tyler—a key offensive player both as a scorer and as a facilitator, having averaged 18.3 points and 6.5 assists as a sophomore in 1991–92—would miss the majority of the season. Forward-center Albert Burditt—who led the 1991–92 team in rebounds and blocks—would average 14.9 points, 14.1 rebounds, and 4.2 blocks per contest in the 1992–93 season, but would be limited by injury to playing in only 12 games. Following a 63–53 win over Princeton in the first game in a four-team tournament in Charlotte, North Carolina, the Longhorns suffered one of the most lopsided losses in school history to Dean Smith's No. 7 and eventual national champion North Carolina Tar Heels, 104–68. Texas fell to Utah in Salt Lake City, 87–76, defeated Illinois in Austin, 89–72, and suffered an 85–76 loss to No. 15 Oklahoma in the All-College Tournament before beginning conference play. Texas began 0–4 in SWC play and suffered four home losses among its 10 total conference defeats. In the course of the conference season, the Longhorns lost to unranked non-conference opponents LSU in a neutral-site game, Georgia in Athens, and Virginia Commonwealth (VCU) in Austin by scores of 84–81, 78–70, and 66–60, respectively. Texas defeated Rice in the SWC Tournament before losing to Houston in the semifinals to end the season.\nDespite the disastrous 1992–93 season, Texas returned a healthy roster deep with talent and experience for the 1993–94 season. Point guard B. J. Tyler, the future 20th overall pick in the forthcoming 1994 NBA draft, and Albert Burditt, future second-round selection in the 1994 Draft, returned in full health (Tyler after missing the first four games) after each having missed the majority of the previous season. Texas was not ranked in the preseason polls, but the potential for significant improvement was evident. Prior to the beginning of the season, sportswriter Gene Wojciechowski labeled the 1993–94 Longhorns a Final Four candidate, opining that Tyler, Burditt, and Terrence Rencher were the three best players in the SWC. With Tyler still absent, Texas struggled in its first four games, narrowly defeating Nebraska in Lincoln, 78–75, and losing a road contest to LSU and a home game against Florida by scores of 86–66 and 76–68, respectively. The Longhorns' struggles continued, as Texas fell 96–86 to No. 16 Connecticut in Storrs and 86–61 to Rick Pitino's Kentucky Wildcats in Maui to post a 2–4 record in its first six games. Texas won its final game in Maui against Notre Dame before facing Oklahoma in Austin. Against Oklahoma, the Longhorns were finally able to end a nine-game program losing streak (extending back to 1979) and a five-game losing streak under Penders, defeating the Sooners 87–75 in Austin. The Longhorns avenged the previous season's loss to Utah with a 93–91, double-overtime home win over Rick Majerus's Utes before losing a closely contested game at Illinois, 83–78. After losing its first SWC game, Texas won 18 of its next 19 games in the regular season and in winning the SWC Tournament, with its only loss coming in double-overtime to Texas Tech in Lubbock, 128–125, and with its wins coming by an average of 22.1 points (and only once by fewer than 12). The Longhorns finished the SWC Tournament with a 25–7 overall record, a 12–2 conference record and outright SWC championship, and a No. 20 ranking in the final AP Poll. Texas received a No. 6 seed in the NCAA tournament and defeated Western Kentucky by a score of 91–77 to advance to a second-round contest against third-seeded Michigan, national runner-up the preceding two years. The Longhorns lost a close game to the Wolverines, 84–79, who would advance to the Elite Eight before falling to eventual national champion Arkansas, which defeated Michigan by the second-narrowest margin of its six NCAA tournament wins in 1994. Texas finished the season with a 26–8 overall record, matching Jack Gray's 1946–47 Final Four team and Abe Lemons' 1978 NIT Championship team for most wins in program history. Albert Burditt earned first-team all-SWC honors for the 1993–94 season. B. J. Tyler was recognized as the Southwest Conference Player of the Year and became the first Texas men's basketball player to receive All-American honors since LaSalle Thompson in 1982.\nPenders resigned on April 3, 1998, following a scandal involving the unlawful release of player Luke Axtell's grades to the media. Longhorn players Axtell, Chris Mihm, Gabe Muoneke, and Bernard Smith had met with Texas Athletic Director DeLoss Dodds \"to say that they had lost faith in Penders and his program.\"\nIn ten years at Texas, Penders' teams appeared in eight NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship NCAA Tournaments, advancing past the first round in all but one appearance. Penders finished as the then-winningest coach (by win total) in program history, with an overall record of 208–110 (.654).\nRick Barnes era (1998–2015).\nHired as the twenty-third men's basketball coach in Texas history on April 12, 1998, Rick Barnes left Clemson University to take over a Texas program coming off of a losing season and \"in disarray\" following Tom Penders' resignation.\nDespite playing with just seven scholarship players for the majority of the 1998–99 season—and opening the season with a 3–8 record—Barnes engineered one of the greatest midseason turnarounds in school history. The Longhorns won 16 of their final 21 games, posting a 13–3 record in conference play and winning the school's first regular season Big 12 Conference championship by a two-game margin. Texas finished the year with a record of 19–13, earning with a No. 7 seed in the NCAA tournament.\nIn 2002, Texas advanced to the NCAA Sweet Sixteen for the first time since the 1996–97 season, and for only the third time since the expansion of the tournament to 64 participants in 1985. The 2003 Longhorn basketball team matched the school record for most basketball victories in a season with their 26–7 mark and advanced to the NCAA tournament Final Four round for the first time in 56 years, and for the third time in school history. Along the way, Texas earned its highest ranking in school history in both the Associated Press and the ESPN/USA Today polls (No. 2 in both polls on Dec. 2, 2002) and received its first No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Sophomore point guard T. J. Ford became the first UT male player to earn the Naismith and Wooden Awards as college basketball's National Player of the Year in 2003.\nDespite the early departure of Ford to the NBA as the eighth overall pick (Milwaukee Bucks), Texas compiled a 25–8 overall record in 2004 and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen round for a school-record third consecutive year. The four senior starters on the 2004 team graduated as the winningest class in school history (98 wins) to that point. In 2006, the Longhorns recorded the program's first 30-win season (30–7), claimed a share of the Big 12 Conference regular season championship, received a No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament, and advanced to the Elite Eight (Texas fell to LSU in overtime), marking the fourth time in five years that Texas had advanced to at least the NCAA Sweet Sixteen. The 2006 class, which finished with 101 wins in four years, bested the 2004 class's mark of 98 wins to become the then-winningest class in the history of Longhorn basketball.\nThe 2005–06 season also marked the hundredth anniversary of basketball at UT. Special logos were placed on the uniforms to commemorate this anniversary.\nIn 2006, the Longhorns introduced blue-chip recruit and future NBA superstar Kevin Durant to Austin. A recruiting class which included in-state talents such as Damion James and D. J. Augustin helped garner unforeseen levels of hype and scrutiny for the Texas basketball program. Durant's spectacular lone season at Texas resulted in his receiving unanimous National Player of the Year honors. The Longhorns, however, saw their season end at the hands of the USC Trojans in the second round of the 2007 NCAA tournament. Durant became the No. 2 overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft by the former Seattle SuperSonics, and was the 2014 NBA Most Valuable Player with the Oklahoma City Thunder.\nIn the 2009 NCAA tournament, Texas earned a No. 7 seed in the East Region. The Longhorns defeated the Minnesota Golden Gophers in the first round by a score of 76–62 behind the sharp shooting A.J. Abrams. The Longhorns' season came to a close with a 74–69 second-round loss at the hands of the Duke Blue Devils. The 2009 graduating class finished with 109 wins, besting the 2006 class's mark of 101 wins to become what remains the winningest class in school history.\nDuring the 2009 recruiting cycle, Texas acquired top-tier prospects Avery Bradley and Jordan Hamilton. Partnered with veteran Damion James, center Dexter Pittman and a solid stable of guards, the Longhorns achieved their first-ever No. 1 ranking in 2010, roaring to a 17–0 start. Texas' fortunes turned upside-down with a 71–62 loss on the road to Kansas State and the ensuing 88–74 loss to Connecticut, beginning a 7–10 finish and raising the pressure for Barnes' Texas teams to reach over the hump, a recurring theme in the head coach's final six seasons in Austin. More of the same occurred in 2011, when Texas garnered two elite prospects in Canadians Tristan Thompson and Cory Joseph and had a similar scorching (23–3) start—only to lose the league to Kansas again and fall in the second round of the NCAA tournament to the Arizona Wildcats. Bradley left the program for the NBA in 2010, and Hamilton, Thompson, and Joseph followed suit in 2011.\nIn the 2012–13 season, Barnes' Longhorns finished 16–18 and missed their first NCAA tournament since 1997–98—the season prior to Barnes' arrival. This began a slow, yet cascading trend by fans and media to replace what had become Texas' winningest basketball coach. Not much change was expected, but turbulence within the Texas athletic department ensued following Dodds' retirement in 2013. New UT Athletic Director Steve Patterson set out to dramatically change the entire Longhorn program, with the resignation of popular football coach Mack Brown following the 2013 football season. Fans and media began to speculate that Barnes' job was at similar risk; even in recruiting—seen as Barnes' specialty—the program could not capture much of the elite Texas talent that had begun to emerge in recent seasons.\nAfter a 2013–14 season in which the Horns defied very low expectations by finishing with a 24–11 record, tying for third place in the Big 12, and reaching the NCAA tournament, Barnes was named Big 12 Coach of the Year, and calls for his job tempered again. The 2014–15 season began with raised expectations from Longhorns fans and media, especially with the signing of top-ranked Dallas-area center Myles Turner. The Horns were ranked as high as No. 6 in the AP and coaches polls, yet only managed to finish sixth in the Big 12 in a very competitive season of conference play. The 20–14 Longhorns' loss to Butler in the opening round of the NCAA tournament marked the final game coached by Barnes at the university. After declining to meet Patterson's demand that he fire his assistants in order to save his job, Barnes was removed from his post as head basketball coach in late March.\nShaka Smart era (2015–2021).\nAfter many days of deliberation and speculation over who would fill Barnes' post, which included names such as Wichita State coach Gregg Marshall (who was heavily courted by Alabama), Villanova coach Jay Wright, and Virginia's Tony Bennett, Texas reached an agreement with Virginia Commonwealth head coach Shaka Smart on April 2, 2015. Smart was introduced as the 24th Texas men's basketball head coach the following day at a press conference in Austin.\nThe Longhorns finished 20–13 in Smart's first season, including a fourth-place finish in the Big 12 Conference. The scheduled included the school's first-ever basketball game in China - a 77–71 loss to Washington. Point guard Isaiah Taylor returned to lead the team in scoring for the second straight season, averaging 15 points per game. The Longhorns struggled at times in the season after center Cameron Ridley went down with an injured foot that caused him to miss all of conference play, returning for a brief stint in the conference tournament and in Texas' NCAA tournament game. Texas won four of its last six regular season games, including a 76–63 win over a top-five Oklahoma team in Austin, but lost in the first round of the Big 12 Conference tournament to Baylor, 75–61. In the first round of the NCAA tournament, the Longhorns lost, as a half-court shot off the backboard lifted Northern Iowa to a 75–72 win.\nIn 2017, the Longhorns went 11–22, finishing with their most losses since the 1983 season. Texas struggled with consistency early in the season, but after leading scorer Tevin Mack was suspended in January, the Longhorns went 4-12 the rest of the way, including seven straight losses to end the regular season. Mack, a sophomore guard, left the team and transferred to Alabama. Freshman center Jarrett Allen led Texas the rest of the way, averaging 16 points and almost 10 rebounds in Big 12 Conference play. Allen declared for the NBA draft after the season, and the Brooklyn Nets selected him with the 22nd pick of the first round.\nUnder Smart, the Longhorns' recruiting situation improved dramatically, with players such as Matt Coleman, Andrew Jones, Mo Bamba, Jaxson Hayes, and Greg Brown standing out for the team during that time. Texas made the NCAA tournament in 2018, losing to Nevada in the first round, followed by an NIT win in 2019. The 2019–20 season was seen as a failure until a late-season rally by the Longhorns, which arguably saved Smart's job, along with the COVID-19 pandemic which canceled the NCAA tournament that year.\nIn 2020–21, the Longhorns won their first Big 12 tournament title, following a strong showing in a regular season marred by COVID-19 cancellations (including the Longhorns' own semifinal against Kansas). After defeating Oklahoma State for the Big 12 title, Texas suffered arguably its most infamous loss in school history, as the third-seeded Longhorns fell, 53–52, to 14th-seeded Abilene Christian in the first round of the NCAA tournament. Smart, under duress, decamped for Marquette on March 26.\nChris Beard era (2021–2023).\nOn April 1, 2021, Texas Tech head basketball coach Chris Beard accepted the head coaching position at Texas. Widely considered the top candidate from the moment Smart departed, Beard is a 1995 alumnus of the University of Texas and served as student manager under Tom Penders during his time on campus.\nIn Beard's only full season of coaching at the school, Texas managed 22 wins and an NCAA appearance, which ended in the second round at the hands of Purdue. The 2022–23 'Horns started strongly at 7−1 before Beard was suspended in December for allegations of domestic violence.\nOn January 5, 2023, Beard was fired as head coach amid a felony domestic violence charge, which was later dropped as the alleged victim recanted her initial statements.\nRodney Terry as interim coach (2022−2023).\nRodney Terry, Beard's top assistant, was given the reins on an interim basis for the remainder of the season. Terry guided a senior- and transfer-heavy Longhorn team to a second-place Big 12 finish, behind perennial conference power Kansas. Silver linings in Terry's interregnum included an emphatic 75−59 victory over the Jayhawks in the final regular season game, which portended the team's eventual performance in the 2023 Big 12 tournament.\nTexas would defeat Kansas in the tournament final to clinch an automatic bid in the NCAA tournament, the second time in three years this has occurred and the first tournament final win over Kansas in school history.\nIn the NCAA tournament the Horns would defeat Colgate, Penn State, and Xavier en route to the school's first Elite Eight appearance in 15 years; the squad would lead Miami by double-figures in the second half but ultimately fell short, 88–81. The team finished with a 22–8 record with Terry as interim coach.\nRodney Terry era (2023–present).\nOn March 27, 2023, Rodney Terry agreed to a deal to become Texas's full-time Head Coach. Terry signed a 5-year, $15.3 Million contract.\nFacilities.\nClark Field (1906–12, 1914–16).\nClark Field, originally known as Varsity Athletic Field, was an on-campus, outdoor stadium that was the original home of the Texas Longhorns men's basketball team, as well as the Longhorn football, baseball, and track teams. The stadium opened in 1887. In its final years, the facility held 20,000 spectators.\nThe Texas Longhorns men's basketball team moved indoors to the new Men's Gym in 1917.\nBen Hur Temple (1913).\nHead coach Carl C. Taylor, seeking an indoor home venue for the basketball team, reached an agreement with the Ben Hur Temple in downtown Austin to rent the building's theater for basketball games and five hours of practice weekly for the 1913 season for $75. The building was originally constructed in 1872 as an opera house for the \"Turnverein\", a German gymnastics, social, and cultural society, and it had been purchased in 1912 by the Shriners and Scottish Rite Masons. Basketball goals were mounted on the balcony and in front of the stage, boundary lines were drawn on the double-layer pine floor, and bleachers were erected on each side of the diminutive court, bringing seating capacity to roughly 350 people, including spectators in the balcony and on the stage.\nDue to the insufficient size of the court and capacity of the theater, the off-campus location, and the added expense of renting the facility, the basketball team returned to its outdoor home at Clark Field for the 1914 to 1916 seasons.\nMen's Gym (1917–28).\nThe university constructed the Men's Gym adjacent to Clark Field to serve as the temporary home of the Texas men's basketball team pending the construction of a permanent gymnasium. Built for a total cost of $8,500, the all-wood Men's Gym measured 115' by 105' and 23' high and featured a pinewood floor, an electric scoreboard, and seating for 2,500 spectators.\nThe Texas men's basketball team played home games in the Men's Gym beginning with the 1917 season through the end of the 1927–28 season. On March 25, 1928, the Men's Gym caught fire and burned to the ground. While the loss of the Men's Gym advanced the timeline for the construction of a new gymnasium for men's basketball, the team would be left without an on-campus home for the following two seasons, playing instead in the gymnasiums of the Texas School for the Deaf and Austin High School before moving into the new Gregory Gymnasium for the 1930–31 season.\nTexas School for the Deaf and Austin High School Gymnasiums (1928–30).\nFor the 1928–29 season, the university reached an agreement with the Texas School for the Deaf for the Texas men's basketball team to play its home games in TSD's recently constructed fieldhouse. The TSD fieldhouse had a seating capacity of just one-sixth of the Men's Gym, precluding the sale of tickets to the general public and requiring the use of a lottery for the allocation of tickets to students and existing season ticket holders.\nProlonged inclement weather delayed the completion of Gregory Gymnasium, originally intended to debut in the 1929–30 season with the Southwest Conference opening home game against Baylor, and, consequently, the Longhorns had to play home games away from campus for the entirety of the season. Texas played its nonconference games in the TSD Gym before moving into the recently completed 1,500-seat Austin High School Gymnasium for its five SWC home games.\nGregory Gymnasium (1930–77).\nOriginally built in 1930, Gregory Gymnasium was named after its main advocate and planner, Thomas Watt Gregory. An alumnus of the university, Gregory served on the university's Board of Regents and as United States Attorney General (1914–19) before the gym was built. Gregory Gymnasium is located on the UT central campus, a short distance southeast of the UT Main Building, Tower, and Main Mall and facing west onto Speedway Avenue, the campus's central north–south street.\nThe Texas men's basketball team played home games in Gregory Gymnasium beginning with the 1930–31 season until moving into the Special Events Center (later renamed the Frank Erwin Center) for the 1977–78 season.\nFrank Erwin Center (1977–2022).\nThe Texas men's basketball team opened the Frank Erwin Center on November 29, 1977, with an 83–76 victory over the Oklahoma Sooners. The Longhorns won their first 25 games in the Erwin Center before falling to Arkansas in February 1979.\nBuilt for a total cost of $34 million, the building is named for former UT alumnus and Board of Regents member Frank Erwin. Originally known as the Special Events Center, the facility was renamed in 1981 to honor Erwin, who had died earlier that year. The Erwin Center is located at the southeastern corner of the UT central campus and is bounded on the east by Interstate 35.\nA two-level layout (the lower arena and upper mezzanine) currently accommodates up to 16,540 spectators for basketball games. UT undertook extensive renovations of the facility from 2001 to 2003 at a cost of $55 million, adding, among other things, new and renovated seating, new video and sound systems, new lighting, and 28 suites. As part of the project, UT constructed the Denton A. Cooley Pavilion, a state-of-the-art practice and training facility that sits adjacent to the Erwin Center.\nThe master plan released in 2013 for the university's new Dell Medical School indicated that the Erwin Center would be demolished in a later phase of construction within 6–15 years. In 2022, the Erwin Center was replaced by the Moody Center\nDenton A. Cooley Pavilion practice and training facility (2003–2022).\nBuilt during the final phase of the renovation of the Erwin Center, the Denton A. Cooley Pavilion opened in the fall of 2003. The two-level, 44,000-square-foot building sits adjacent to the Erwin Center and serves as a state-of-the-art practice and training facility for the Texas men's and women's basketball teams. The Pavilion is named for Dr. Denton A. Cooley, a UT alumnus, basketball letterman (1939–41), and pioneering heart surgeon.\nThe Texas men's and women's basketball teams have separate 9,000-square-foot practice court areas, each consisting of one full-court and one half-court practice area with seven basket stations. The practice facility also includes a locker room with a players' lounge, an instructional film theater, a 4,100-square-foot strength and conditioning area, an athletic training and hydrotherapy area, an academic resource and activity center, and a coaches' lounge and locker room.\nThe Cooley Pavilion will be demolished and replaced during the same phase of construction of the Dell Medical School as the Erwin Center.\nMoody Center (2022–present).\nMoody Center is a $375M, 15,000+ seat premier venue featuring over 150 nights a year of unique entertainment. Moody Center features the best and biggest names in the music industry while hosting The University of Texas Women's and Men's basketball games, family shows and other sporting and local events.\nNew Texas basketball and rowing training facility.\nTo replace the Cooley Pavilion, Texas is building a new basketball practice facility adjacent to the new Moody Center. This new facility will include locker rooms for both teams, training areas, 2 full-sized practice courts, weight room, and team offices. It will also be combined with a practice facility for the Texas Rowing team.\nChampionships.\n&lt;br&gt;\nNational championships\n&lt;br&gt;\nConference championships\n&lt;br&gt;\nInvitational tournament championships\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nTexas has appeared in the NCAA tournament on 38 occasions (9th-most appearances all time, and second only to Kansas among Big 12 Conference members). The Longhorns' overall record in the Tournament is 40–41, with one loss vacated by NCAA action taken against a Longhorn opponent.\nNCAA tournament seeding history.\nThe NCAA began seeding the Tournament in 1979. Texas has appeared in 31 of the 45 seeded Tournaments (and in 30 of the last 35).\nNIT results.\nThe Longhorns have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) five times. Their combined record is 11–3. Texas won the NIT Championship in 1978 and 2019.\nCBI results.\nThe Longhorns have appeared in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) one time. Their record is 0–1.\nPolls.\nAP and coaches polls.\nTexas has been ranked in at least one of the final AP or coaches polls in 19 seasons since their introduction prior to the 1948–49 and 1950–51 seasons, respectively. The Longhorns have recorded five top-ten finishes and two top-five finishes in one or more of the final polls. Ten of Rick Barnes' teams, five of Tom Penders' teams, two of Abe Lemons' teams, and two of Harold Bradley's teams finished the season ranked. As of November 27, 2018, Texas teams have been ranked in 252 of 1168 total weekly AP Polls (21.6%) since the inception of the poll in the 1948–49 season (37th all-time in AP Poll appearances), and in 295 of 1153 total weekly coaches polls (25.6%) since the inception of the poll in the 1950–51 season.\nPremo-Porretta Power Poll (pre-1949).\nTexas has been ranked in the retroactively assigned Premo-Porretta Power Poll rankings in 11 seasons from the 1906 season through the 1947–48 season, the final season before the introduction of the AP Poll. Five Longhorn teams were ranked among the top-ten teams in their respective years, and three Texas teams received top-three rankings. Texas was selected as the poll's national champion for the 1932–33 season.\nAll-time series records.\nAll-time series records against Big 12 members.\nTexas men's basketball leads the all-time series against all Big 12 Conference opponents but Kansas (which leads 31–8), Kansas State (21–15), and Oklahoma (54–39).\nIn series against conference opponents since the advent of the Big 12, Texas trails only KU (which leads 27–7) and KSU (16–15).\nAll-time series records against former Big 12 members.\nTexas men's basketball leads the all-time series against all former Big 12 Conference opponents but Missouri (which leads 13–12).\nTexas holds a winning record against all former Big 12 members in games played in Big 12 competition.\nAll-time series records against non-Big 12 former SWC members.\nIn series against former Southwest Conference members who are not current members of the Big 12, Texas trails only Arkansas (which leads 87–68).\nIn contests against these opponents since the dissolution of the Southwest Conference, Texas holds the lead against all opponents but Southern Methodist, whom the Longhorns have not played since joining the Big 12. The Longhorns hold the advantage against every opponent in the last five games played and all opponents but Arkansas in the last ten games played against each respective opponent.\nRivalries.\nBig 12 rivals.\nOklahoma Sooners.\nWith the formation of the Big 12 Conference in 1996, the Oklahoma Sooners became the Longhorns' main rival in basketball. Texas and Oklahoma are not traditional rivals in any sport other than football, due to their prior residence in different conferences (UT in the Southwest Conference and OU in the Big Eight Conference); nonetheless, the two basketball programs had already compiled a significant series history prior to formation of the Big 12, having met 14 times from 1947 to 1957, 11 times from 1986 until the beginning of Big 12 competition in 1997, and at various other times in the programs' histories. The Sooners entered the Big with a 29–13 lead in the all-time series, having won 10 of the 11 games played from 1986 to 1996. In the Big 12, the competitiveness of the Texas and OU basketball programs—which are second and third in all-time Big 12 regular season conference wins, respectively—only accelerated the development of the basketball rivalry.\nThe Texas Longhorns and the Oklahoma Sooners play one game in Austin and one game in Norman each year during the regular season. Oklahoma leads the overall series 54–39; Texas leads 26–25 in games played since the inception of the Big 12. Texas has held the upper hand in recent years, winning 23 of 35 meetings from 2003 to 2018.\nKansas Jayhawks.\nRick Barnes' tenure also coincided with the emergence of a rivalry between Texas and the Big 12 Conference's traditional national basketball powerhouse, the Kansas Jayhawks. Under Rick Barnes, the Longhorns emerged as Kansas's most consistent competition for Big 12 Conference supremacy. From the inception of the Big 12 through February 18, 2018, Texas has produced a 223–139 () mark against conference competition during the regular season, trailing only Kansas's record of 299–63 ().\nThe first decade of the 2000s saw the peak of this new rivalry, with the Longhorns at one point trailing Kansas only 5–7 in games played over an almost-nine-season period, and with many of the contests being closely contested classics. Since the beginning of the 2008–09 season, Texas has been less competitive both nationally and in the rivalry, trailing Kansas 2–15 in games played since that time.\nTexas and Kansas played one game during the regular season until the 2011–12 season, when the two schools began meeting twice per year. Kansas leads the overall series 30–8 and has won 26 of the 33 contests since the Big 12 was formed. Current KU head coach Bill Self is 20–6 in games against Texas since becoming the Jayhawks' head coach prior to the 2003–04 season.\nBaylor Bears.\nThe Longhorns' series with the Baylor Bears has featured more games played than any other UT basketball series; it is also the conference series most lopsided in UT's favor, with the exception of the Longhorns' series against former Southwest Conference opponent Rice and the much more abbreviated series against former Big 12 member Nebraska. Texas leads 162–90 in the overall series with Baylor.\nThe intensity of the in-state rivalry has grown sharply in recent years with Baylor's emergence as a nationally competitive program under current head coach Scott Drew. Through the end of the 2008–09 regular season, Texas held a 25–3 record against Baylor in Big 12 competition and a 24–0 record against the Bears under Rick Barnes. In games played since the 2009 Big 12 conference tournament semifinals, Baylor holds a 15–7 edge over Texas.\nTexas Tech Red Raiders.\nTexas and Texas Tech have played at least twice yearly since the 1957–58 season. The Longhorns and the Red Raiders play one game in Austin and one game in Lubbock each year during the regular season.\nAt the time that UT and Texas Tech entered the Big 12, Texas Tech held a 49–45 lead in the all-time series against Texas. Longtime Red Raider coach Gerald Myers' teams dominated the Longhorns for much of the 1970s and 1980s, with the only interlude of Longhorn success occurring during the six-year tenure of Abe Lemons (1976–82), who finished 8–4 against the Red Raiders. By the time Tom Penders became the Texas head coach prior to the 1988–89 season, Texas Tech held a 43–32 lead in the series. Penders narrowed Texas Tech's lead to 50–49 during his tenure (1988–98). During Rick Barnes' 17 seasons as head coach (1998–2015), the Longhorns posted a 33–4 record against the Red Raiders, for a period of dominance unequaled at any other point in the series.\nTexas currently leads the overall series 86–57 and has won 41 of the 49 contests since the formation of the Big 12.\nOklahoma State Cowboys.\nThe formation of the Big 12 led to the development of a competitive rivalry between Texas and the Oklahoma State Cowboys, two programs that had already compiled a significant series history despite their residence in different conferences since OSU's departure from the Southwest Conference following the 1924–25 season. Between 1941 and 1979, Texas and OSU met 32 times, with the Cowboys winning 21 of the meetings. At the time of the formation of the Big 12, OSU held a 24–19 lead in the all-time series.\nThe rivalry reached its peak in the early years of the Big 12, above all when the tenures of Rick Barnes and Eddie Sutton coincided at the two schools, a time when both programs were nationally prominent. From the 1999–2000 season through the 2004–05 season, at least one of the two teams was ranked in 13 of 14 total contests, and both teams were ranked at the time of eight of the 14 meetings. In recent years, the rivalry has declined in intensity as both programs have receded from the national spotlight.\nTexas and Oklahoma State have played at least twice yearly since 1997, the first Big 12 basketball season. The Longhorns and the Cowboys play one game in Austin and one game in Stillwater each year during the regular season. Texas currently leads the overall series 49–43 and holds a 30–19 lead in games played in Big 12 competition.\nOther rivals.\nArkansas Razorbacks.\nTexas and Arkansas shared a bitter rivalry in basketball—stoked by the mutual enmity that characterized their primary rivalry in football—throughout most of the existence of the Southwest Conference. Until Arkansas' departure for the Southeastern Conference after the 1990–91 season, the Longhorns and the Razorbacks had played at least twice—and often three times—each year since the 1924 season. Texas and Arkansas each won or shared 22 SWC championships (nine more than the nearest competitor, SMU)—although Texas claimed seven of these in the years before Arkansas established its basketball program in 1924 and in the years after Arkansas left the conference.\nThe Texas–Arkansas basketball rivalry was particularly competitive in its first quarter-century, and both programs enjoyed substantial overall success during this time, with each appearing in two Final Fours and one Elite Eight with the beginning of the NCAA Tournament in 1939 through the end of the 1940s. Arkansas led the series 29–25 over this span.\nBoth Texas and Arkansas faded from national significance with the end of the 1940s. From the 1949–50 season through the 1975–76 season, Arkansas won only two SWC championships, made only a single NCAA Tournament appearance, and posted an overall record of 312–338 (.480). Texas fared modestly better during this time, winning seven SWC championships, making four NCAA Tournament appearances, and posting an overall record of 342–323 (.514). The Longhorns and Razorbacks split their conference series during this period, with each winning 29 games.\nThe rivalry grew especially heated from the mid-1970s onward as both schools' athletic departments poured additional resources into their basketball programs, both for coaching hires and for facilities, each seeking to revive programs that had receded from the national stage over the preceding quarter-century. While both Texas and Arkansas appeared to be on the verge of establishing nationally competitive programs with the hires of Abe Lemons and Eddie Sutton, respectively, only Arkansas managed to achieve sustained success in the following years, winning at least 20 games in 13 seasons from 1977 to 1991, with Sutton (1974–85) and Nolan Richardson (1985–2002) each reaching a Final Four and an Elite Eight. (Richardson would lead the Razorbacks to two more Final Fours and a national championship after Arkansas' departure from the SWC.) Arkansas dominated the series over this final phase of the SWC rivalry, winning 27 out of 37 games played during this period.\nArkansas led the series 85–64 upon leaving the SWC; the Razorbacks currently lead the all-time series 87–68, with Texas having won four of the six games played since Arkansas joined the SEC.\nTexas A&amp;M Aggies.\nBefore the Texas A&amp;M Aggies' departure for the Southeastern Conference at the end of the 2012 academic year, Texas and Texas A&amp;M had played at least twice (and up to four times) yearly since 1917. During their concurrent membership in the Big 12, the Longhorns and the Aggies played two games during the regular season, with the venue alternating between the home courts of each school. Texas leads the overall series 137–86.\nBy the time the Big 12 was formed, the in-state rivalry was at a low ebb. The Longhorns had won 18 of the previous 21 contests against the Aggies, dating back to the 1987–88 season. Texas continued to dominate the series in Big 12 play, winning 15 of the first 16 contests between the schools in their new conference. By the time the Aggies hired Billy Gillispie prior to the 2004–05 season, the lopsided nature of the series—and the lack of Aggie fan interest in a program that had gone ten consecutive years without a winning season or postseason appearance under prior coaches—had long since diminished the stature of the once-heated rivalry.\nWith the rejuvenation of the Texas A&amp;M basketball program under Billy Gillispie (2004–07) and Mark Turgeon (2007–11), the basketball rivalry between Texas and Texas A&amp;M quickly intensified. The Aggies successfully defended their home court from Gillispie's first year through the 2009–10 season, Mark Turgeon's second-to-last season with A&amp;M. The Longhorns defeated the Aggies in all three games in Turgeon's final season and in both games in Billy Kennedy's first season with the Aggies. Texas is 12–7 against Texas A&amp;M since Gillispie was hired in 2004.\nThe rivalry will be renewed when Texas joins A&amp;M in the SEC prior to the 2024–25 season.\nIndividual honors, awards, and accomplishments.\nHonors, awards, and accomplishments by player.\nThe individual honors, awards, and accomplishments listed in the succeeding subsections are aggregated by player in the following table. Players with only all-conference honors (other than conference player of the year), lower than first-team All-America honors, or later than second-round draft positions are not included.\nNaismith Basketball Hall of Fame.\nSlater Martin is the only Longhorn men's basketball player to have been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts. Martin was inducted on May 3, 1982.\nRetired numbers.\nThree Longhorn men's basketball players have had their Texas jersey numbers retired: Slater Martin, T. J. Ford, and Kevin Durant.\nThe primary requirement for the retirement of a UT student-athlete's number is that the individual have won a widely recognized National Player of the Year award. Former UT Athletic Director DeLoss Dodds stated that an exception was made in the case of Slater Martin because, as a Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame inductee, he was a legend in the sport of basketball but had competed before any of the widely recognized awards were established (the \"Sporting News\" Men's College Basketball Player of the Year was established in 1943, but it was not awarded from 1947 to 1949).\nNational honors and awards (players).\nNational Player of the Year.\nT. J. Ford and Kevin Durant are the only Texas players to win one or more of the widely recognized National Player of the Year awards. Ford won the Naismith Trophy and the Wooden Award—as well as four of the other eight widely recognized awards—in 2003 as a sophomore. Durant was the unanimous national player of the year in 2007 as a true freshman, winning all 10 awards. Durant was the first freshman ever to win any of the National Player of the Year awards.\nBob Cousy Collegiate Point Guard of the Year Award.\nThe Bob Cousy Award is awarded annually by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame to the top point guard in NCAA Division I men's basketball. The award was presented for the first time following the 2003–04 college basketball season (the season following T. J. Ford's departure to the NBA). D. J. Augustin is the only Longhorn to win the Bob Cousy Award.\nPerry Wallace Most Courageous Award.\nThe Perry Wallace Most Courageous Award is the men's version of the USBWA Most Courageous Award, presented annually by the United States Basketball Writers Association to one or more individuals (not necessarily players) who, in the organization's words, have \"demonstrated extraordinary courage reflecting honor on the sport of amateur basketball.\" First presented in 1978 as a single award, separate men's and women's awards were first presented in 2010. The award's bifurcation by sex or gender does not reflect that of the recipient, but is instead based on whether the recipient was involved with the men's or women's game. This award was originally not restricted to college basketball, but every recipient since 1980 has been associated with the college game. The men's award was renamed in 2021 in memory of Wallace, the first African American to play basketball in the Southeastern Conference. Andrew Jones is the first Longhorn to receive this award; he shared 2022 honors with Justin Hardy, a player at NCAA Division III Washington (MO). Both averaged double figures in scoring for their respective teams in 2021–22 while battling cancer (leukemia for Jones, stomach cancer for Hardy).\nAll-America honors.\nTwenty Texas basketball players have received All-America honors on 26 occasions; six have been recognized as All-Americans in two different seasons. Seven Longhorns have received consensus first-team All-America honors, and three others have received consensus second-team All-America honors. Thirteen Texas players have received first-team All-America honors in 14 seasons, with one Longhorn player having been selected as a first-team All-American twice.\nConference honors and awards (players).\nConference Player of the Year.\nTexas players have won conference player of the year honors on ten occasions—eight times in the Southwest Conference and twice in the Big 12 Conference. Two Longhorn basketball players won SWC player of the year honors twice. Three Texas players have won Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year honors.\nFirst-team all-conference honors.\nSeventy-two Texas men's basketball players have received first-team all-conference honors on 96 occasions. Of these 72 players, 18 have received first-team all-conference honors in two seasons, and three players have received them in three seasons.\nFirst-team All-Southwest Conference\nFirst-team All-Big 12 Conference\nFreshman Player of the Year.\nEight Longhorn freshmen men's basketball players have won conference freshman of the year honors—three players in the Southwest Conference and five players in the Big 12 Conference.\nSouthwest Conference Freshman of the Year\nBig 12 Conference Freshman of the Year\nConference tournament most valuable player.\nFive Longhorn men's basketball players have won conference tournament most valuable player honors—four players in the Southwest Conference tournament and one player in the Big 12 Conference tournament.\nSouthwest Conference tournament Most Outstanding Player\nBig 12 Conference tournament Most Valuable Player\nProfessional basketball.\nNBA draft history.\nAs of July 30, 2021, 48 Longhorn men's basketball players have been selected in the NBA draft in the history of the program. Of these, 19 were selected in the first round, and 13 were selected in the second round. Among Big 12 programs, Texas trails only Kansas (33) in the number of players drafted in the first round all-time.\nSince 1997, Texas has had 23 players drafted overall; of these, 15 were drafted in the first round. Among Big 12 programs, Texas trails only Kansas (34 picks overall, 22 first-round picks) in the numbers of players drafted overall and in the first round during this period. The 15 Longhorn players drafted in the first round from 1997 to 2021 exceed the all-time numbers of first-round picks at each Big 12 school but Kansas.\nNBA players.\nAs of April 7, 2024, 40 Texas players have played in the NBA in league history. Of these, 20 played at Texas under Rick Barnes. Ten Longhorn players currently play in the NBA.\nAll-time NBA players\nCurrent NBA players\nNon-NBA professional players.\nAll-time non-NBA professional players\nCurrent non-NBA professional players\nOlympians.\nFour Longhorn men's basketball players have competed in the Olympic Games in men's basketball on six occasions, with three players winning gold medals.\nKevin Durant was the leading scorer on the United States men's basketball team that won the gold medal in the 2012 Olympics. Durant's 156 total points during the Olympic tournament set a record for most points scored by an American basketball player in Olympic competition, surpassing the record previously set by Spencer Haywood in the 1968 Olympics by 11 points. Durant also set the U.S. record for most made three-point shots in an Olympic competition with 34 (on 65 attempts). In addition to leading the U.S. team in scoring, he finished second on the team in rebounding, first in blocked shots, and second in steals.\nIn the 2016 Olympics, Durant again led the U.S. men's team in scoring with 155 total points—one point fewer than his U.S. Olympic record from 2012—and in minutes played. He finished second on the team in steals, third in assists, and fourth in rebounding. Durant converted 25 three-point shots on only 43 attempts (.581).\nCoaching honors and awards.\nNational Coach of the Year honors.\nAbe Lemons (1976–82) won the NABC National Coach of the Year award following his second season at Texas, a season that saw the Longhorns finish 26–5, win a share of the Southwest Conference title, and win the 1978 NIT Championship. Texas had finished just 9–17 two years earlier in Leon Black's last season as head coach.\nRodney Terry was named Sporting News National Coach of the year for the 2022–23 season, becoming the first Texas coach to win the award since it was introduced in 1964.\nJohn R. Wooden Legends of Coaching Award.\nThe Wooden Legends of Coaching Award is a lifetime achievement award established prior to the 1998–99 season. Selection for the award depends upon a number of on- and off-court factors, from coaching success and philosophy to evidence of good character to graduation rates. Rick Barnes won the Wooden Legends of Coaching Award following the 2008–09 season.\nConference Coach of the Year honors.\nAbe Lemons was recognized as the Southwest Conference Coach of the Year for the 1977–78 season, the season that saw him win the NABC National Coach of the Year award. Tom Penders received Southwest Conference Coach of the Year honors in 1994 and 1995, and Rick Barnes was named Big 12 Coach of the Year in 1999, 2003, 2008, and 2014.\nDistrict-level Coach of the Year honors.\nRick Barnes won recognition as NABC District 9 Coach of the Year in five seasons (1999, 2001, 2003, 2008, 2014). Barnes was also a four-time recipient of USBWA District VII Coach of the Year honors (1999, 2001, 2003, 2011).\nRecords.\nTeam records include single-season, single-game, and NCAA Tournament records for the Texas program.

        "title": "2008 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 2008 Tour de France was the 95th running of the race. The event took place from 5 to 27 July. Starting in the French city of Brest, the tour entered Italy on the 15th stage and returned to France during the 16th, heading for Paris, its regular final destination, which was reached in the 21st stage. The race was won by Carlos Sastre.\nUnlike previous years, time bonuses were no longer awarded for intermediate sprints and for high placement on each stage. This altered the way the General Classification was awarded in comparison to previous seasons.\nTeams.\nLong running disputes between the event organisers, the ASO and the UCI reached a head when the race organisers insisted upon the right to invite, or exclude, whichever teams it chose for the event. Under UCI rules, any ProTour event must be open to all member teams of the UCI's top level. The ASO made it clear that, despite changes in team management and personnel, it intended to exclude from the event as a result of its involvement in the doping scandals that marred the 2007 Tour and its links to the 2006 Operación Puerto doping case. This meant that the champion (Alberto Contador) and third-place finisher (Levi Leipheimer) from 2007, both of whom had since signed with Astana, could not compete in the 2008 Tour.\nThe ASO announced on 20 March 2008 that all ProTour teams except Astana would be invited, along with three wildcard teams: , , and (subsequently renamed as ). With each team consisting of nine riders, 180 riders started the Tour.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nUCI ProTour teams\nInvited teams\nPre-race favourites.\nBecause was not invited to the 2008 Tour de France, the winner of the 2007 Tour de France, Alberto Contador, the 3rd-place finisher Levi Leipheimer and the 2004 and 2006 Tour de France runner up Andreas Klöden did not compete. Ten days before the start of the tour, Contador picked Cadel Evans as the likely winner for 2008. Shown in the table below are the riders that, according to the bookmakers in the months before the start of the 2008 Tour de France, had a chance of winning the 2008 Tour better than or equal to 25/1. The odds shown are the odds in July 2008, directly before the start of the race. Thomas Dekker and Michael Rogers were also given odds in this range, but were not included in the Tour de France.\nRoute and stages.\nThe 2008 Tour de France was almost entirely in France, with only a small part in Italy. In previous years, the Tour started with a prologue, followed by a week of flat stages. The flat stages were dominated by the sprinters' teams, and the yellow jersey was worn by a sprinter who had a good prologue. At the presentation of the Tour de France 2008 schedule, Tour Director Christian Prudhomme announced that the 2008 Tour would be different: \"We have wanted a first week of racing with much more rhythm. With no prologue, an uphill finish that will suit different types of sprinters at the end of stage one, with a short time trial on stage four and the first mountain at Super-Besse only 48 hours later, we have decided to change the scenario.\" The time bonuses at the end of each stage were removed, and there was of time trials, less than usual. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the Cime de la Bonette loop road on stage 16.\nRace overview.\nIn the first week of the 2008 Tour de France, the stages were mostly flat. As traditionally in the Tour de France, this resulted in small breakaways of cyclists, and the sprinters' teams trying to get them back. In the first stage, the sprinters won, with Thor Hushovd winning the stage, but in the second stage, four cyclists managed to stay away. The fourth stage was a time trial, won by Stefan Schumacher, who took over the lead. In the fifth stage, the sprinters won the battle and Mark Cavendish won the stage.\nThe Massif Central mountains were visited in stage six and seven. In stage six, all the breakaways were caught, and the favourites stayed together and finished together. In stage seven, the same scenario, only now Luis León Sánchez managed to stay a few seconds ahead and win the stage. The eighth stage was a sprinter stage, won by Cavendish. Then, from stage nine, the Pyrenees were climbed. Riccardo Riccò broke away from the bunch on the final climb, and won the stage. On stage 10, a group of four with some main contenders escaped, and Leonardo Piepoli won the stage. Stage eleven had easier climbs, and a group of four riders, not important for the overall classification, were allowed to break away and win by 14 minutes.\nStages twelve to fourteen were flat stages, and were dominated by the sprinters. Mark Cavendish won another two stages, and Óscar Freire took his first. In the fifteenth stage, a group of four cyclists escaped and stayed away, a similar thing happened in stage sixteen. In the seventeenth stage, Carlos Sastre placed a surprise attack (not only a surprise for his opponents, but also for his teammates and directeur sportif) won the stage and took the lead in the general classification. The eighteenth and nineteenth stage again saw breakaways of cyclists not important for the general classification. The twentieth stage, a time trial, was won by Stefan Schumacher who had also won the first time trial. The last stage was a sprinters' stage, won by Gert Steegmans.\nDoping.\nOn 26 May 2008, the 2007 green jersey (points) winner Tom Boonen tested positive for cocaine. Since this was outside competition, Boonen was not sanctioned by the UCI or WADA, but he was nevertheless barred from the 2008 Tour de France.\nFollowing protracted disagreement between the organisers of the Tour de France (ASO) and the UCI, the race was sanctioned by the Fédération Française de Cyclisme (FFC), as was the 2008 Paris–Nice in March. Thus the FFC were in charge of the doping controls before and during the race, and rather than increasing the number of doping controls during the Tour, they applied a more targeted approach on suspect riders. The French government's anti-doping agency AFLD carried out approximately 60 random and targeted tests in the weeks leading up to the Tour. They took blood samples from all the 180 riders in a two-day period just before the first stage, and during the race took samples from up to 14 riders a day shortly after the stage was finished, 250 tests being run in total. The Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) also performed unannounced doping tests of riders at the finish of stage 15, which ended at the ski resort of Prato Nevoso, Italy. On 3 July 2008, France enacted a law criminalizing using or trafficking in doping substances.\nOn 11 July news broke that Spanish rider Manuel Beltrán tested positive for erythropoietin after the first stage of the tour. Blood abnormalities before the tour start had led AFLD to target the rider. Beltrán's team Liquigas withdrew him from the tour with immediate effect. French law enforcement authorities questioned Beltrán over possible offences and searched his hotel room, but he claimed his innocence. The B-Sample has not yet been tested.\nOn 13 July, prior to the ninth stage, it was revealed that AFLD had informed team doctors that five riders had unusually high hematocrit levels. The Italian press reported that Riccardo Riccò, who won the stage later that day, had been selected for testing several times during the first week, which led to a suspicion that he was among those whose teams had been notified. Riccò has for some time been known to have a naturally high hematocrit level of 51%, above the 50%-level which usually is taken to be an indicator of possible blood manipulation. Riccò stated that he has a licence confirming that this is a natural, long-term condition, which he gave to the doping agencies before the start of the race, but he later admitted to the offence at a hearing of the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI).\nOn 16 July Barloworld started the 11th stage without Moisés Dueñas, who had been withdrawn from the team after being tested positive for EPO at the end of the time trial fourth stage. Barloworld Ltd, two days later, announced that they were withdrawing from sponsorship after this year's Tour de France, but on 28 October, they announced that they would sponsor the team for another year.\nOn 17 July, shortly before the start of stage 12, Ricardo Riccò and the rest of the Saunier Duval–Scott team, withdrew from the race after the announcement that he had tested positive for MIRCERA, a new type of EPO, at the end of stage 4. Leonardo Piepoli, winner of stage 10, was sacked by his team for \"violation of the team's ethics code\" the following day, though no positive test was reported at that time. Almost 3 months later his tests came back positive for samples taken one day prior to the start of the Tour, on 4 July, and also on 15 July, on the rest day in Pau.\nOn the last day of the race, but after the end of the stage, Dmitry Fofonov was announced to have tested positive for the banned stimulant heptaminol after Stage 18. He was asked for a medical exemption to use the stimulant, but did not produce one. He was subsequently fired by his team Crédit Agricole.\nAfter the race ended, French cyclist Jimmy Casper was suspended from Agritubel because he tested positive after the stage to Super Besse for glucocorticoids, an asthma drug that is banned unless the user has a medical exemption for its use. Casper, an asthmatic, carried a therapeutic use exemptions (TUE) for the last twelve years but failed to renew this exemption. His authorisation expired on 29 May and was not renewed before the 2008 Tour de France. The French cycling federation's disciplinary commission exonerated Casper.\nIn late September it was announced that several Tour de France riders were to have their blood samples retested for traces of EPO. Pierre Bordry, the head of AFLD, claimed the testing involved riders who were already under scrutiny for suspicious urine samples. AFLD had suspicion that there was MIRCERA in some samples but the laboratory could not say definitively. The urine tests were somewhat unreliable at giving definitive results, so the AFLD decided to order the blood samples taken before and during the Tour for additional testing with a newly developed CERA blood test.\nAs a result of this additional testing, both Leonardo Piepoli and Stefan Schumacher tested positive for the same substance which Riccò used, MIRCERA. The riders were declared positive by AFLD.\nOn 13 October 2008, the AFLD announced that Bernhard Kohl, who finished in third place overall and winner of the climbers' competition, had also tested positive for MIRCERA on 3 and 15 July, before and during the Tour de France. Initial results were verified, and Kohl also confessed to doping. His third-place overall finish in the 2008 Tour and his first place in the King of the Mountains competition are considered vacancies in the Tour's official history.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were four main individual classifications contested in the 2008 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. There were no time bonuses given at the end of stages for this edition of the Tour. If a crash had happened within the final of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing in the highest positions in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type. The leader was identified by a green jersey.\nThe third classification was the mountains classification. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category and \"hors catégorie\", with the more difficult climbs rated lower. The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\nThe final individual classification was the young rider classification. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1983. The leader wore a white jersey.\nThe final classification was a team classification. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie. The riders in the team that lead this classification were identified with yellow number bibs on the back of their jerseys.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass start stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have \"made the greatest effort and who has demonstrated the best qualities of sportsmanship\". The winner wore a red number bib the following stage. At the conclusion of the Tour, Sylvain Chavanel () was given the overall super-combativity award.\nThere were also two special awards each with a prize of €5000, the Souvenir Henri Desgrange, given in honour of Tour founder and first race director Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Galibier on stage 17, and the Souvenir Jacques Goddet, given in honour of the second director Jacques Goddet to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Tourmalet on stage 10. Stefan Schumacher won the Henri Desgrange and Rémy Di Gregorio won the Jacques Goddet.\nPrize money.\nA total prize fund of approximately €3.25 million was awarded throughout the tour. In addition, each team received €51,243 towards expenses of participation, with an additional €1,600 per rider who completed the race, provided that at least seven did so.\nBy tradition, a team's winnings were pooled and shared among the riders and support team. Team CSC, the team of Tour winner Sastre, won the most prize money, more than €600,000. Saunier Duval's prize money was not awarded after the positive tests of Riccardo Riccò."

Hermann Maier of Austria won gold medals in the two speed events, the downhill and super-G (a dead-heat tie with Kjus). Austria dominated the women's two speed events with a sweep of all six medals. The men's downhill, super-G, and combined events were held at Beaver Creek, and the seven other events were at Vail.\nThis was the third non-Olympic World Championships held in the United States, all in Colorado.

According to the IHF rules, each continent had three places (except Oceania, which had one), and the host (Germany) and holders (Spain) were automatically qualified. The other nine places are allocated to the continents according to performance in the 2005 World Men's Handball Championship. Thus:\nAfrica.\nThe 2006 African Men's Handball Championship in Tunisia resulted in four teams qualifying for the tournament.\nAmericas.\nThe Pan-American qualifying events was scheduled to be held in Brazil in April 2006.

        "title": "Super Bowl Experience",
        "text": "The Super Bowl Experience (formerly the NFL Experience) is an annual event which has been held since 1992 at a venue in the host city of the Super Bowl. The event is described as an interactive \"theme park\", featuring various fan-oriented attractions, including football-related activities and autograph sessions with current and former players. Proceeds from the sale of Super Bowl Experience tickets go to fund the NFL's Youth Education Town (YET) initiative, which constructs facilities (typically in low-income neighborhoods of Super Bowl host cities) offering afterschool programs for youth. Tickets to this event are free and can be assessed at the OnePass App on the NFLs main website.\nIn November 2017, the NFL opened an NFL Experience attraction at New York City's 20 Times Square, in collaboration with Cirque du Soleil, which featured a similar array of interactive experiences and memorabilia. Consequently, the NFL began to refer to the travelling event as the \"Super Bowl Experience\" beginning in 2018 for Super Bowl LII in Minneapolis–Saint Paul. The Times Square experience was later closed.\nHistory.\nThe first NFL Experience was held at the Minneapolis Convention Center in January 1992 prior to Super Bowl XXVI. The NFL's interactive theme park was followed by Major League Baseball's first \"FanFest\" in San Diego, California six months later.\nIn 2013 the NFL Experience was hosted at the New Orleans Morial Convention Center.\nThe NFL Experience was not held for Super Bowl XLVIII. Instead, the NFL organized an outdoor festival, Super Bowl Boulevard, along Broadway and Times Square, which featured a similar array of fan-oriented events and attractions (such as an artificial toboggan hill). Animal Planet held a \"Puppy Bowl Experience\" at the Discovery Times Square exhibition promoting its annual \"Puppy Bowl\" special (which traditionally airs on the day of the Super Bowl), to ride the festivities' coattails.\nThe 2015 NFL Experience was hosted at the Phoenix Convention Center.\nThe 2016 NFL Experience was hosted at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.\nThe 2017 NFL Experience was hosted at George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston. The Houston Super Bowl Host Committee also hosted its own outdoor festival, \"Super Bowl Live\", in the adjacent Discovery Green park, which featured entertainment events.\nFor Super Bowl LII, the event was renamed the Super Bowl Experience, and was held at the Minneapolis Convention Center. The Super Bowl LIII edition was held at the Georgia World Congress Center.\nThe Super Bowl Experience for Super Bowl LIV was held at the Miami Beach Convention Center.\nSuper Bowl LV's Super Bowl Experience was held at Julian B. Lane Riverfront Park, with capacity and health protocols in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSuper Bowl LVI’s Super Bowl Experience was held at the Los Angeles Convention Center. \nNFL Experience Times Square.\nOn November 30, 2017, the NFL opened an attraction known as NFL Experience Times Square, within four ground-level floors of 20 Times Square in New York City. The 40,000 square-foot attraction was a collaboration with Cirque du Soleil Entertainment Group, and featured various interactive activities and multimedia experiences, including a 4D film, a simulated locker room and practice area, displays of memorabilia, and a bar and restaurant that would feature a rotation of menu selections from NFL stadiums. In February 2018, it was announced that NFL Network's \"Good Morning Football\" would move to a studio at the attraction in April, after having previously used a CBS studio in New York City.\nIn September 2018, it was announced that the attraction would close, citing underperforming attendance numbers (which analysts pegged to poor promotion by the NFL, and high ticket prices). It was to remain open through at least the end of 2018. \"Good Morning Football\" moved to SportsNet New York's facilities at 4 World Trade Center in November 2018."

        "title": "World Amateur Golf Ranking",
        "text": "The World Amateur Golf Ranking for men was introduced by The R&amp;A, the governing body of the sport of golf outside the United States and Mexico, on 23 January 2007. It is based on the results of over 2,600 amateur tournaments per year (and amateurs participating in certain professional events) and is updated each Wednesday. Rankings are based on the players' average performances in counting events over a rolling period. This period was 52 weeks initially but was gradually expanded during 2016 to 104 weeks, similar to those of the Official World Golf Ranking.\nLike the Official World Golf Ranking for male professional golfers, the amateur ranking was initiated by The R&amp;A to provide a more reliable means of selecting an appropriate field for one of its tournaments. The professional ranking was initially used to help set the field for The Open Championship and the amateur ranking plays a role in selecting the field for The Amateur Championship, which was previously selected mainly on the basis of national handicap systems. Other tournament organisers will be able to use the rankings to select players if they so wish.\nThe first set of rankings featured over 1,000 players from 46 countries and was headed by the 2006 U.S. Amateur champion, Richie Ramsay of Scotland.\nIn February 2011, the United States Golf Association (USGA) endorsed the rankings and announced it would use them for an exemption category in all their men's amateur championships, including the U.S. Amateur, beginning in 2011.\nThe women's rankings were started in February 2011. Japan's Mitsuki Katahira was the first number one. American Rose Zhang holds the record for most weeks at the top of the rankings with 142 weeks.\nOnly three male and two female golfers have ever held the No. 1-ranking as both an amateur and a professional. The first to do so was Rory McIlroy, who was when he became the No. 1 amateur and when he first became the world No. 1 professional. Jordan Spieth was the second to accomplish this feat, he was when he topped the amateur rankings and when he reached No. 1 in the Official World Golf Ranking. Jon Rahm, who was ranked no. 1 for 60 weeks, became professional world no. 1 in July 2020. Lydia Ko was the first player to accomplish this feat in the female ranking. She was only and held the ranking for a record 130 consecutive weeks, and she was a mere when she first reached the pinnacle of the Women's World Golf Rankings (WWGR). Atthaya Thitikul held the amateur No. 1 for 12 weeks in 2019–2020 and topped the WWGR on 31 October 2022.\nElite events.\nPrior to 2020, events were ranked in eight categories: Elite, A, B, C, D, E, F or G. The Elite events are listed below. The calculation of the ranking changed in 2020 and there are no longer any categories."

        "title": "Major League Baseball collusion",
        "text": "Major League Baseball collusion refers to owners working together to avoid competitive bidding for player services or players jointly negotiating with team owners.\nCollusion in baseball is formally defined in the Major League Baseball Collective Bargaining Agreement, which states \"Players shall not act in concert with other Players and Clubs shall not act in concert with other Clubs.\" Major League Baseball went through a period of owner collusion during the off-seasons of 1985, 1986, and 1987.\nHistorically, owner collusion was often referred to as a \"gentleman's agreement\". After the 1918 season, owners released all their players – terminating the non-guaranteed contracts, with a \"gentleman's agreement\" not to sign each other's players, as a means of forcing down player salaries.\n1966–1968.\nBefore the 1966 season, Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale decided to jointly hold out during salary negotiations with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Koufax and Drysdale were the team's star pitchers who had helped the Dodgers win the 1965 World Series. The Dodgers needed them if they were to have any chance of returning to the World Series in 1966. After holding out for the first 32 days of spring training, the pair agreed on one-year contracts: Koufax for $125,000 and Drysdale for $110,000. At the time, these were the two largest contracts in baseball history. The owners were fearful that other star players would follow their example.\nCollective Bargaining Agreement.\nIn 1968, new union leader Marvin Miller negotiated baseball's first Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with team owners. The owners wanted to prohibit players from holding joint negotiations. Miller was willing to agree, provided that the ban applied to the owners as well. The owners readily agreed, and every CBA since then has included the sentence: \"Players shall not act in concert with other Players and Clubs shall not act in concert with other Clubs.\"\n1985–1987.\nShortly after being elected commissioner in 1984, Peter Ueberroth addressed the owners at a meeting in St. Louis. Ueberroth called the owners \"damned dumb\" for being willing to lose millions of dollars in order to win a World Series. Later, at a separate meeting with the general managers in Tarpon Springs, Florida, Ueberroth said that it was \"not smart\" to sign long-term contracts. The message was obvious—hold down salaries by any means necessary. It later emerged that the owners agreed to keep contracts down to three years for position players and two for pitchers.\nCollusion I.\nThe free agent market following the 1985 season was different from any since the Seitz decision a decade earlier. Of 35 free agents, only four changed teams—and those four were not wanted by their old teams. Star players, such as Kirk Gibson, Tommy John and Phil Niekro, did not receive offers from other teams. The cover of the December 9, 1985 edition of \"Sporting News\" asked, \"Why Won't Anyone Sign Kirk Gibson?\" George Steinbrenner offered Carlton Fisk a contract, then withdrew the offer after getting a call from Chicago White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf. Teams also reduced team rosters from 25 to 24 players.\nBy December, several agents thought something was amiss, and complained to Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) president Donald Fehr. In February 1986, the MLBPA filed its first grievance, later known as \"Collusion I.\"\nCollusion II.\nThe free agent market following the 1986 season was not much better for the players. Only four free agents switched teams. Andre Dawson took a pay cut and a one-year contract to sign with the Chicago Cubs. Three fourths of the free agents signed one-year contracts. Star players that ended up back with their old teams included Jack Morris (Detroit Tigers), Tim Raines (Montreal Expos), Ron Guidry (New York Yankees), Rich Gedman (Red Sox), Bob Boone (California Angels), and Doyle Alexander (Atlanta Braves).\nFor the first time since the start of free agency, the average major league salary declined. The average free-agent salary dropped by 16 percent, while MLB reported revenues increasing by 15 percent. This prompted the MLBPA to file a second grievance (Collusion II) on February 18, 1987. Even as this was happening, Ueberroth ordered the owners to tell him personally if they planned to offer contracts longer than three years.\nIn September 1987, the Collusion I case came before arbitrator Thomas T. Roberts, who ruled that the owners had violated the CBA by conspiring to restrict player movement.\nCollusion III.\nAfter the ruling, the owners changed their tactic, but not their intent. They created an \"information bank\" to share information about what offers were being made to players. Players affected included Paul Molitor, Jack Clark, and Dennis Martínez. In January 1988 the MLBPA filed its third grievance (Collusion III).\nOn January 18, 1988, Roberts ordered the owners to pay $10.5 million in damages to the players. By then, only 14 of the 1985 free agents were still in baseball, and Roberts awarded seven of them a second chance as \"new look\" free agents. They could offer their services to any team without losing their existing contracts. On January 29, 1988, Kirk Gibson signed a $4.5 million, three-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers.\nIn October 1989, arbitrator George Nicolau presided over Collusion II, and found in favor of the players. Nicolau determined damages of $38 million. \"New look\" free agents included Ron Guidry, Bob Boone, Doyle Alexander, Willie Randolph, Brian Downing and Rich Gedman.\nCollusion III damages were $64.5 million. Owners would also have to compensate the players for losses related to multi-year contracts and lost bonuses. \"New look\" free agents from this settlement were Jack Morris, Gary Gaetti, Larry Andersen, Brett Butler and Dave Henderson.\nA final settlement of the three collusion cases was reached in November 1990. The owners agreed to pay the players $280 million, with the MLBPA deciding how to distribute the money to the damaged players.\nAt that time, then-commissioner Fay Vincent told the owners:\nMiller largely agreed with Vincent's sentiments, saying Ueberroth and the owners' behavior was \"tantamount to fixing, not just games, but entire pennant races, including all post-season series.\"\nLater, Vincent would blame baseball's labor problems of the early 1990s, including the 1994–95 strike, on player anger at what he called the owners' theft from the players.\nCollusion and expansion.\nIn 2005, Vincent claimed that the owners used the Major's two rounds of expansion in the 1990s (which produced the Florida Marlins, Colorado Rockies, Arizona Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Devil Rays) in part to pay the damages from the collusion settlement.\n2000s.\nCollusion allegations: 2002–2003.\nPlayers alleged that owners engaged in collusion in the 2002 and 2003 seasons. As part of the 2006 CBA, owners agreed to pay the players $12 million from \"luxury tax\" revenue sharing funds. The agreement was made with no admission of guilt.\nCollusion concerns: 2007.\nIn November 2007, the MLB Players' Union raised concerns that owners collusively shared information about free agents and possibly conspired to keep the final price of Alex Rodriguez's new free agent contract down.\nCollusion allegations: 2008.\nIn October 2008, the MLB Players' Association indicated that it would file a collusion grievance against the owners claiming that they conspired illegally to keep Barry Bonds from receiving a 2008 contract. The grievance was abandoned because there were no grounds to force a team to sign a player against their will, and no proof of any organized effort against Bonds."

        "title": "Singapore Grand Prix",
        "text": "The Singapore Grand Prix is a motor racing event which forms part of the Formula One World Championship. The event takes place on the Marina Bay Street Circuit and was the inaugural night race and first street circuit in Asia designed for Formula One races.\nThe original Singapore Grand Prix was held at Thomson Road from 1966 to 1973, before returning to the calendar in 2008 at Marina Bay. Fernando Alonso won the inaugural Formula One edition of the renewed Grand Prix, driving for the Renault team amid controversial circumstances, when it emerged a year later that his teammate Nelson Piquet Jr. had been ordered to crash on purpose by senior team management to bring out the safety car at a time chosen to benefit Alonso. The race itself was also notable for being the 800th Formula One World Championship race since its inception in 1950, and the first ever Formula One race held at night.\nSince its inception, Marina Bay has been known for featuring at least one safety car in every race edition, with a total of 24 safety car deployments as of 2023. The Singapore Grand Prix has been considered to be one of the most challenging and unique tracks on the Formula One calendar. Sebastian Vettel has the most wins on the track, with five Singapore Grand Prix victories. In 2022, a contract extension was announced which will put the race on the Formula One calendar until at least 2028.\nHistory.\nFormula Libre.\nFirst organised in 1961, the race was initially known as the \"Orient Year Grand Prix\", located at the Thomson Road Grand Prix circuit.\nIt was renamed to the Singapore Grand Prix in 1966, shortly after Singapore became a sovereign country in 1965. The event was discontinued after 1973 and a variety of reasons have been suggested, including an increase in traffic, the very high danger and unsuitability of the track for racing, the inconvenience of having to close roads for the event and fatal accidents during the 1972 and 1973 races.\nFormula One.\nAnnounced in 2008, an agreement for a five-year deal was signed by Singapore GP Pte Ltd, the Singapore Tourism Board and Bernie Ecclestone. In November 2007, it was announced that the telecommunications company Singtel would be the title sponsor of the event. The official name of the event became the Formula 1 SingTel Singapore Grand Prix. The race was co-funded by the Government of Singapore, footing 60% of the total bill, or S$90 million, out of a total tab of S$150 million.\nAround 110,000 tickets were made available for the country's first Formula One race. Corporate hospitality suites and packages went on sale at the end November 2007, three-day passes to the public went on sale in February 2008. Single-day passes went on sale a month later. The event went on to achieve a full sell-out for all of its tickets. The 2008 race hosted the Amber Lounge after-party and in 2010, Singapore became the second location to host the Amber Lounge Fashion show.\n2008.\nThe first race held at the new Marina Bay Street Circuit was the 15th round of the 2008 FIA Formula One World Championship, and was also the first night-time event in Formula One history. The timing of the night event also meant that it could be broadcast live at a convenient time for TV audiences outside of the Asia-Pacific. The track was also illuminated by a series of projectors which adapt their output to match the shape of the course. On track, Felipe Massa was the first man to sit on the Singapore pole in his Ferrari, and dominated the race until he was released early at a pit stop, breaking his fuel rig and dropping him to last place. The race was won by Fernando Alonso driving for the Renault team, though that result has since been tarnished by controversy. Renault were found to have ordered Nelson Piquet Jr. to crash, as the ensuing safety car would strongly benefit Alonso.\n2009.\nFor the 2009 race, the circuit was reprofiled slightly, including modifications to turns 1, 2 and 3 to aid overtaking, and also at turn 10 where high kerbs caused many accidents in 2008. McLaren driver and reigning World Champion Lewis Hamilton took pole position and sprinted away to win. Timo Glock finished second for Toyota, and Fernando Alonso was third in the first race for Renault after they received a suspended disqualification from the sport for manipulating the previous year's race.\n2010.\nFernando Alonso became the first man to win twice in Singapore. Now at Ferrari, he took pole and resisted Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel on his way to the 25th victory of his F1 career. Michael Schumacher, making his F1\ncomeback in 2010, struggled in his Mercedes and was 13th, while Heikki Kovalainen leapt from his burning Lotus T127, borrowed a fire extinguisher and put the fire out himself.\n2011.\nSebastian Vettel, an eight-time winner in 2011 before Marina Bay, led the drivers' championship by over 100 points. He won the race from his 11th pole of the season. Vettel, Button, Webber, Alonso and Hamilton filled the top five places. Michael Schumacher again struggled as he slammed into the Sauber of Sergio Pérez.\n2012.\nOn 22 September 2012, the AP reported that Bernie Ecclestone and the Singapore Grand Prix had agreed that the Grand Prix would remain on the Formula One calendar until 2017. Lewis Hamilton claimed his fifth pole of the season for McLaren and his second in Singapore. A surprise visitor to the front row alongside him was the Williams of Pastor Maldonado, but it was Sebastian Vettel's Red Bull that inherited the race lead when Hamilton pulled out with gearbox problems. Vettel then dedicated his 23rd Grand Prix win to Sid Watkins, who had died shortly before the race.\n2013.\nFor the 2013 race, it was announced that the 10th turn of the track, the \"Singapore Sling\" chicane, would be reconfigured so the cars would have to navigate a flowing left-hander before accelerating towards the Anderson Bridge.\nSebastian Vettel took his third successive win in Singapore with Red Bull and the 33rd of his career as a fourth straight title also loomed. He did it from his second Singapore pole, recovering from the surprise of seeing Nico Rosberg's Mercedes briefly ahead at race start to take victory by over half a minute. Fernando Alonso was on the podium yet again before stopping his Ferrari to pick up Mark Webber, whose Red Bull was in flames at Turn 7.\n2014.\nOn 15 April 2014, it was announced that Singapore Airlines would sponsor the Singapore Grand Prix, starting from that year.\nF1's new-generation turbo-charged, hybrid-powered cars brought a new look to the track, ending the reign of the 2.4-litre power unit, but a controversial ban on radio communications dominated pre-race proceedings. Mercedes's Lewis Hamilton sailed to his seventh win of the year, becoming Singapore's third multiple winner in the process as teammate Nico Rosberg retired with technical problems. Sebastian Vettel, bound for Ferrari in 2015, finished second ahead of new Red Bull partner Daniel Ricciardo.\n2015.\nLewis Hamilton arrived in Singapore one pole position shy of his idol Ayrton Senna's record run of eight in a row. Another win would also put Hamilton on 41 – the same number as Senna. Sebastian Vettel took his first Ferrari pole, then made it four wins at Marina Bay as Hamilton retired with a loss of electrical power just after half-distance. Daniel Ricciardo split the two Ferraris in second place, while Formula One rookie Max Verstappen shouted 'No!' when told to move over for Toro Rosso teammate Carlos Sainz.\nDuring the 2015 race a spectator entered the track on the straight after Anderson Bridge, as leaders Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo sped by. He climbed over the fencing when the safety car was deployed. Eventual race winner Vettel described the man as 'crazy' in his post-race interview. The 27-year-old man was arrested by Singapore police after the incident. CCTV footage showed he had sneaked through a gap in the fencing.\n2016.\nNico Rosberg was making his 200th Grand Prix start. He was locked in a two-man tussle for the title with Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton. Rosberg took pole position, and held off Daniel Ricciardo to win while Hamilton finished third. Rosberg went on to win the title.\n2017.\nOn 19 June 2017, the FIA's World Motor Sport Council in Geneva released its provisional 2018 calendar, in which the Singapore Grand Prix was given a tentative date of 16 September. At the time, the race (as well as the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai) were subject to confirmation by the commercial rights holders. On the eve of the 2017 race, the track and F1 announced an extension for the race through 2021. This race was a critical event in the season as polesitter and title contender, Sebastian Vettel, was involved in a first corner collision with Ferrari teammate Kimi Räikkönen and Red Bull's Max Verstappen, which led to the retirement of all three drivers. Vettel's title rival, Mercedes's Lewis Hamilton, took full advantage and won the race from 5th on the grid to extend his championship lead over Vettel from 3 points to 28.\n2018.\nAfter a disappointing weekend in Monza, Ferrari arrived in Singapore with high hopes of a victory. However, Lewis Hamilton took pole position, ahead of Max Verstappen and the Ferrari of Vettel. At the start, the two Racing Point Force India drivers, Sergio Pérez and Esteban Ocon had an incident which resulted in Ocon retiring. Vettel overtook Verstappen right before the Safety Car was deployed. Vettel was the first of the front runners to pit, on lap 15. He was put on ultrasoft tyres, while most other people who pitted during that time went for the softs. He exited behind Pérez but overtook him a lap later. Verstappen pitted for soft tyres on lap 18, and exited just in front of Vettel. Vettel, being on the higher wear ultrasofts, did not attack in order to make it to the end. On lap 34, Pérez had a clash with Sergey Sirotkin which resulted in him getting a drive-through penalty. Sirotkin himself got a 5-second time penalty after forcing Brendon Hartley off the track. Later on in the race, he was battling with Romain Grosjean as Hamilton and Verstappen approached to lap them. Instead of letting the leaders pass, Grosjean continued to attack Sirotkin which allowed Verstappen to close the gap to Hamilton and nearly overtake him. The Frenchman was handed a 5-second penalty and 2 penalty points on his licence. In the end Hamilton won, with Verstappen second and Vettel third, increasing his championship lead over the German to 40 points.\n2019.\nComing off a second consecutive victory for Ferrari under rising star Charles Leclerc, Ferrari was on course to continue their rise in form; after an early trip back to pit lane during FP1, Leclerc powered through to take pole position ahead of Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel. After making a pit stop, Leclerc lost the lead to his teammate Vettel and eventually Hamilton, who had gambled on an extended running time on the soft tyres and later came out behind both Ferrari drivers. For a brief moment, Antonio Giovinazzi led the race for the Alfa Romeo-Sauber team before being overtaken four laps later by Vettel. After Giovinazzi was passed by faster cars, three safety cars were called for the retirements of George Russell, Sergio Pérez and Kimi Räikkönen. Ultimately, the podium consisted of Sebastian Vettel, who took his last career race win, Charles Leclerc and Max Verstappen. This was Ferrari's first 1–2 finish since the 2017 Hungarian Grand Prix.\n2020–2021.\nBoth the 2020 and 2021 iterations of the event were cancelled due to the global COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting travel restrictions then-imposed by the Government of Singapore, on arriving foreign tourists.\n2022.\nOn 27 January 2022, the Singapore Grand Prix's contract was extended up to 2028.\n2023.\nThe Grand Prix had major changes in the layout, with turns 16–19 removed to facilitate the construction of NS Square. Instead, there was a new flat-out section until turn 16, former turn 20, with number of laps increased from 61 to 62 and lap times decreased by approximately ten seconds. Race distance was expected to be covered by an hour and a half unlike previous editions usually lasting until the two hours time limit.\n2024.\nThe Grand Prix is due to take place September 20-22.\nTrack description.\nAlthough the track has seen some minor changes as seen above, the basic layout has in many aspects remained unchanged. It is a twisty circuit that is the slowest in Formula One running at normal race distance above , which combined with its features of proximity to walls leads to frequent safety cars, further extending the running to nearing the race time limit of two hours.\nThe race tests the limits for both drivers and cars. It has some 90-degree turns, but with a high degree of variability, featuring technical sections and quick direction changes. Overtaking is primarily done at the end of the first sector, where top speeds are at their highest. Runoff areas exist at the end of the long straights, but are short by Formula One standards. At most parts of the track, cars run very close to the walls. In general, victory is dependent on a drivers' experience and skills.\nThe Singapore Grand Prix has been frequently described by drivers as being the “toughest race of the Formula 1 calendar”; the endurance of drivers is heavily strained due to various factors such as high heat, high humidity, high amount of sweat and bodily fluid loss, high number of corners (19 in total), little margin for error (due to the lack of run-off area within a street circuit) and race finishes always completing near to the 2-hour allocated time limit (with 4 races being time-limited, instead of completing the allotted laps).\nWinners.\nRepeat winners (drivers).\n\"Drivers in bold are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One World Championship.\"\nRepeat winners (constructors).\n\"Teams in bold are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One World Championship.\"\nRepeat winners (engine manufacturers).\n\"Manufacturers in bold are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One World Championship.\"\nBy year.\n\"A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One World Championship.\""

        "text": "The men's pursuit competition at the Biathlon World Championships 2007 was held on 4 February 2007.\nInfo.\nOle Einar Bjørndalen won his second gold medal in as many days, started in front, but Michal Šlesingr caught up with his four-second deficit before the first shooting, and Šlesingr completed a faultless shoot to take a 15-second lead. Deryzemlya and Björn Ferry missed, so no one else were within fifty seconds of the lead, with a group of three including Tomasz Sikora, Mattias Nilsson and Lars Berger (who advanced 13 places from his starting position through the fastest skiing).\nBjørndalen cut the deficit to Šlesingr by half during the second loop, but Šlesingr held onto his lead thanks to a faultless shoot. Berger and Sikora entered the range fighting for third place, with Emil Hegle Svendsen and Nikolay Kruglov, Jr. close behind, and Sikora, Svendsen and Kruglov (after a slow shooting) filled all their targets to leave within a few seconds of each other.\nBjørndalen and Šlesingr came in together to the first standing shooting, about half a minute ahead of the competitors. The leaders missed a few shots, with Bjørndalen getting one penalty loop and Šlesingr two, and Šlesingr thus lost half a minute and was just ahead of Sikora, who also missed once. Svendsen missed twice and was fourth, over a minute behind, and heading a group also consisting of Lars Berger, Vincent Defrasne and Raphaël Poirée.\nBjørndalen's half-a-minute lead grew to 45 seconds by the time he arrived at the shooting range for the final shoot. With a perfect shooting, he had a massive lead into the final 2.5-kilometre loop, and the fight was for the silver medal. Sikora missed twice, while Šlesingr lost many seconds in shooting speed and also missed a target. In the group behind, Berger had taken a lead before the shooting, but missed three shots, and Svendsen and Poirée also missed to leave Defrasne with a lead of 13 seconds on Šlesingr, but over a minute up to Bjørndalen. Maxim Tchoudov, who had not been better than 14th at any stage, now shot a full house and left the range in a group with Svendsen, Poirée and Sikora.\nThere were no errors for Bjørndalen, who could ski the final loop as a lap of honour and still win by a minute, while Tchoudov distanced all his competitors in the chase for medals. Svendsen and Poirée were dropped, he caught and left Šlesingr, before pipping Olympic gold medallist Defrasne to the line and taking silver.\nResults.\nThe race was started at 11:15."

The team was captained by John Egerton, 4th Earl of Ellesmere (Lord Brackley) and played a total of 20 matches between January and April 1905, of which ten are regarded as first-class.\nThe team.\nFor the first time on a tour of the West Indies, professionals were taken: Ernie Hayes of Surrey and George Thompson of Northamptonshire.\nThirteen players toured:\nJohn Moss was taken as umpire and also played in some minor matches. None of the players had been in the earlier touring sides to the West Indies. The inclusion of the two professionals considerably strengthened the team. Thompson had played for Northamptonshire in 1904, their last season as a minor county. He was, however, well up to first class standard. The amateurs were of mixed standard, including a number of useful players like Simpson-Hayward, Somerset and Wynyard together with a number of borderline first class standard including the captain himself. G. Bellamy accompanied the team as scorer and played in a first class match against Jamaica. S. Beton played in a minor match.\nThe tour.\nFirst-class matches are highlighted.\nOf the 10 first-class matches, 6 were won, 3 lost and 1 drawn. Overall 11 matches were won, 3 lost and 6 drawn. The first matches of the tour were in Jamaica rather than Barbados as had happened on previous tours. The tourists were lucky to draw the first match against Jamaica but the next week won heavily by an innings and 169 runs. The tourists lost the second match against Barbados and then twice to Trinidad. Both match against the combined XI were won. A number of the minor matches were drawn but the tourists did win by an innings in all their matches in St. Lucia with the home team never scoring more than 102 in any innings. St. Vincent took the first innings lead in both their games but both matches were drawn.\nAlthough in their mid to late 40s Wynyard and Somerset were highly successful batsmen supported well by Hayes. Other batsmen performed well in the minor matches but were less successful in the important games. Thompson was the mainstay of the bowling taking 75 first class wickets and 126 in all matches. Hayes and Simpson-Hayward also made useful contributions with the ball.\nAverages.\nThe following averages are in the 10 first-class matches\nReturn match.\nWhen the West Indians toured England in 1906 they played a match against Lord Brackley's XI at Lord's. Lord Brackley's XI, all of whom had toured in 1904–05, won the three-day match by two wickets."

This was one of the last first-class tours for the Philadelphian team. The city of Philadelphia was nearing the end of its golden age of cricket and the last first-class game for the team would be played only three years later. \nThe series began at Sabina Park in Kingston on 15 February with a two-day match. In spite of a solid first innings batting performance from William Newhall, the visitors only managed 93 runs. The Jamaican side needed only 12 runs in their second innings to win the match by nine wickets. Charles Morrison did most of the damage for Jamaica taking 11-78 in the match.\nOn 17 February, the series continued at Kensington Park, Kingston. The Philadelphians won the toss and decided to bat first. Behind an 86 from Irish transplant James McDonogh, the visitors made 183 runs in their first innings. This was followed by a 150 from Jamaica. In their second innings, the Americans scored 223. Ranji Hordern bowled very well taking 8 wickets in each innings and helping to hold the home side to only 84 runs in their second innings. The Philadelphians took the match by 172. In this match Malcolm Kerr \"staggered humanity by taking 6-30 in an innings, 9 for 100 in the match, against the Philadelphians, having scarcely been considered a bowler at all before\", his last match for Jamaica.\nThe series concluded with another 2 day match on 19 February at Melbourne Park, Kingston. Again the Philadelphians won the toss and decided to go to bat first. Reggie Conyers, originally from Bermuda opened the batting with a 149 before being bowled. His side finished the first innings with 252 runs. The Jamaicans followed-on after making only 110 runs in their first innings. The Americans needed only 38 runs in their second innings to win the match by 8 wickets. Ranji Hordern again dominated the Philadelphian's bowling taking 13 for 113 in the match. Over the course of the series, Hordern took 34 wickets."

Leveson Gower, who was unable to tour, and captained by Mr. R. A. Bennett. Like earlier touring parties it consisted solely of amateurs. They played a total of 19 matches, of which 13 are regarded as first-class, between January and April 1902.\nTouring party.\nA party of just 11 was taken:\nMr. Lionel Gough Arbuthnot played a number of matches and must have accompanied the tourists. Whatman was the only one of the tourists to have been on one of the earlier tours, having been part of Lord Hawke's team in 1896-97 but had not played any first class cricket between the two tours. Bennett himself and Dashwood had not played first class cricket since 1899 but the remaining eight had played in 1901. Many of the tourists were ex-Oxbridge cricketers, five of them having played in the 1901 Oxford v Cambridge match. The team was younger than the previous touring sides and although inexperienced was at least the standard of the two 1896-97 teams. Wilson received a telegram on his arrival announcing the death of his mother and Dowson was also unavailable for the first game having a cold. Even with Arbuthnot playing an additional player was required and J.A. Davenport made up the 11. A.G. Robinson played in a minor match on the tour.\nBosanquet, Dowson and Wilson had been amongst the team that had recently toured North America in September and October 1901.\nThe team left Southampton on January 8.\nMatches.\nMatches played were:\nFirst class matches are highlighted.\nOf the 13 first class matches, 8 were won and 5 lost. Overall 13 matches were won, 5 lost and 1 drawn. The standard of cricket was noticeably weaker in Jamaica than in Barbados and all 6 matches there were won, several by an innings.\nWith Dowson and Wilson unavailable for the first game against Barbados the tourists' bowling was very weak and they lost heavily. They gained revenge in the second match with a full bowling attack. The West Indies side in the third game consisted of players from Trinidad, British Guiana and Barbados and was won by the West Indies. Two further matches against a combined team were played in Trinidad and British Guiana, the West Indies winning the match in Trinidad and the tourists that in British Guiana.\nWilson, Dowson and Bosanquet were the most successful bowlers. Bosanquet led the batting with 623 runs in the first class games at an average of 34. Dowson scored the only first class century by the tourists with 112 against the West Indies in British Guiana.\nAverages.\nThe following averages are in the 13 first class matches (Batting Bowling)."

        "text": "A team of amateur cricketers under the captaincy of Robert Slade Lucas toured the West Indies in the 1894-95 season, playing matches between January and April 1895. They played a total of 16 matches of which eight are regarded as first-class. It was the first visit of an English cricket team to the West Indies.\nTouring team.\nThe idea for the tour was mainly that of Dr R. B. Anderson, who had lived in Tobago for 23 years. Assistance was also provided by Lord Hawke, Lord Stamford and Neville Lubbock. \nThe Royal Mail Steam Packet Company gave special terms for the round trip and concessions were made with regard to the telegraphic transmission of news. The tourists were to be the guests of the clubs in the different islands.\nA party of 13 was taken:\nOnly five of the tourists had played any first-class cricket prior to the tour, and of these Bush, Sewell and Smith-Turberville had not played a first-class match since 1886. Only Lucas and Bromley-Davenport had played recently at first-class level. Lucas had played for Middlesex since 1891 and Bromley-Davenport for Cambridge University in 1892 and 1893. Indeed, only these two players ever played a significant amount of first-class cricket in England. The standard of the matches was therefore below that of first-class cricket in England. All the 13 played at least one first-class match on the tour.\nThe 13 left Southampton on the \"Medway\" on 16 January 1895 and reached Barbados on 28 January, playing their first match the next day.\nMatches.\nMatches played were:\nFirst-class matches are highlighted. A further match against Grenada in March was abandoned. The matches against Jamaica and Jamaica Born are recognised as the first first-class matches to take place in Jamaica.\nOf the eight first-class matches, four were won, three lost and one drawn. Overall 10 matches were won, four lost and two drawn.\nDawson headed the batting averages with an average of 26 in the first-class games. Sewell was leading run scorer in the first-class games with 269 although in all matches Bush lead with 406 runs. Just two centuries were scored by the tourists both in the second match against Barbados. These were 101 by Bush and 138 by Dawson.\nThe bowling for the tourists was largely in the hands of Bromley-Davenport and Bush who each took over 50 wickets in the first-class matches. Sewell was next amongst the wicket-takers with 11. In all matches Bromley-Davenport and Bush each took over 100 wickets.\nMost of the matches were low scoring. The one exception was the second match against Barbados. Barbados scored 517 although no-one scored a century, George Learmond top scoring with 86. Lucas's XI replied with 303 giving Barbados a first innings lead of 214. Following on, Lucas's XI then scored 396 and dismissed Barbados for 157 to win by 25 runs. Clifford Goodman, who had been successful in the first three innings against the tourists, taking 20 wickets, took just 1/121 in the tourists' second innings.\nAverages.\nThe following averages are from the eight first-class matches (Batting Bowling)."

The English team is sometimes referred to as James Lillywhite's XI. In all, they played 23 matches but only three including the two Tests are recognised as first-class. The first match started at the Adelaide Oval on 16 November 1876 and the last at the same venue on 14 April 1877. There were fifteen matches in Australia and, between January and March, eight in New Zealand.\nA rival tour had been proposed by Fred Grace but was cancelled, enabling most of the best players of the Australian colonies to participate in two matches against James Lillywhite's side. Fred Spofforth, widely regarded as the best Australian fast bowler, controversially withdrew from the first match in protest over the omission of Billy Murdoch as wicket-keeper. Starting on 15 March 1877 the two sides played two matches, later designated Test matches, and the series was drawn 1-1.\nFor more details about the establishment of Test cricket, see . Although both matches have Test status, this series is not considered to be part of The Ashes, which began in 1882.\nSquads.\nTed Pooley was also a member of the English touring party, but had had to be left behind in New Zealand after he was charged with assault."

        "text": "Two English cricket teams toured Australia in 1887–88. They are generally known as A. Shrewsbury's XI and G. F. Vernon's XI. Shrewsbury's XI also visited New Zealand in March.\nIn previous Australian seasons, no more than one English team had toured. The formation of two teams in 1887-88 was described by \"Wisden\" as \"a piece of folly (that) will never be perpetrated again\". The situation was perhaps inevitable given that English cricket still lacked a formal system to regulate the organisation of overseas tours. As a result, any promoter was free to form a team.\nWisden pointed out that \"it was clear from the first that two combinations would not be able to pay their way, and, though we do not know the exact result of Shaw, Shrewsbury, and Lillywhite's venture, the Melbourne Club frankly admitted a heavy loss over Mr Vernon's team\".\nA Shrewsbury's XI.\nThis team was formed by James Lillywhite, Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury after they received an invitation from various parties in Sydney. The players were a mixture of amateur and professional. Although the professional Shrewsbury was effectively the player/manager, the amateur Aubrey Smith was appointed team captain.\nShaw himself did not tour, but stayed at home to put together a football side that played rugby union and Victorian rules (now known as Australian rules) football in Australia after the cricket tour. The tour was a financial disaster, with the Melbourne Cricket Club, Lillywhite, Shaw and Shrewsbury well out-of-pocket. Lillywhite defaulted on his debt.\nThe team played seven first-class matches in Australia including two versus an Australia XI. They played New South Wales three times and individual matches versus Victoria and a Combined XI. After the matches in Australia were completed, the team visited New Zealand and played three non-first-class matches, which were all drawn. In all matches in both countries, Shrewsbury's XI played 25, won 14, drew 9 and lost 2. In first-class matches (in Australia only), the team played 7, won 5 and lost 2.\nThe team members were (amateurs denoted by title):\nG F Vernon's XI.\nLord Hawke, then known as the Hon. M B Hawke, was invited by Melbourne Cricket Club to form this team which, like Shrewsbury's, comprised both amateurs and professionals. Hawke had to return to England at the start of the tour as his father had died, leaving George Vernon to captain the side. \nVernon's XI played eight first-class matches in Australia including two versus an Australia XI. They played twice versus each of New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria. The team visited Australia only and in all matches played 26, won 11, drew 14 and lost 1. In first-class matches, the team played 8, won 6, drew 1 and lost 1.\nThe team members were (amateurs denoted by title):\nTest Match.\nEach team played \"Combined Australia\" sides in matches that are not accorded Test match status. In February 1888 the two touring teams combined as an England team, with Walter Read as captain, to play a timeless Test against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground. England won by 126 runs. \nEngland's team in the Test match was: Walter Read (captain), Arthur Shrewsbury, Andrew Stoddart, George Ulyett, Maurice Read, Bobby Peel, Billy Newham, George Lohmann, Johnny Briggs, William Attewell and Dick Pilling (wk). Australia's team was: Alec Bannerman, Sammy Jones, Harry Moses, Frederick Burton, Jack Worrall, Patrick McShane, Percy McDonnell, Jack Blackham, Tom Garrett, Charlie Turner, John Ferris. \"Wisden\" doubted if the Australian team was truly representative.\nThe match was affected by wet weather and was low-scoring. Australia won the toss and decided to field. This probably looked like the right decision as Ferris and Turner took 9 wickets between them to dismiss England for 113, Arthur Shrewsbury top-scoring with 44. When Australia batted, Lohmann and Peel, bowling unchanged, reduced them to 35 for 8 at stumps on the first day. As a result of continuing rain, and an intervening Sunday, there was no play for three days. On resumption, Lohmann and Peel dismissed Australia for 42. Turner took 7 for 43 as England then set Australia 209 to win. They fell well short with Lohmann and Peel sharing 8 wickets and England won by 126 runs."

The \"Auckland Star's\" London correspondent wrote: \"On the whole, the team does not appeal to me as being particularly formidable, and I fancy the best New Zealand teams will prove quite equal to lowering the visitors' colours.\"\nThe team took their own umpire with them, John Moss, who officiated in all their matches, sharing the duties with a local official.\nThe tour.\nThe team left England on the \"Corinthic\" on 20 October 1906 and arrived in Wellington on 6 December. The New Zealand government allowed them to travel on the railways for 40 pounds.\nFirst-class matches are indicated in bold.\nArnold Williams, Wellington's captain, scored 100. It was the only century scored against the MCC. Wynyard injured his knee so badly while fielding that he was unable to play again on the tour; de Trafford took over the captaincy.\nThe MCC team attributed this loss largely to the voyage from Wellington to Christchurch in rough weather in an overcrowded ship – 660 passengers where there was accommodation for only 360 – and the fact that they had no time to recover. The ship arrived at Lyttelton at 11 a.m. and play began at Lancaster Park at 2.40 p.m. It was the MCC's only loss to a provincial team.\nBranston scored 119 in the first innings, the first of the two centuries scored by MCC batsmen.\nHarrison scored 105 with 20 fours, reaching his century in an hour and a half; MCC made 483 for 9 on the first day.\nJohnson made 99 and 76 not out for MCC, and Douglas took 5 for 56 and 4 for 41. New Zealand's best performance was Jeremiah Mahoney's 71 not out in the first innings.\nThe pitch was vandalized the night before the match. It was repaired as well as it could be before play began, but still left an uneven surface that made batting difficult and even dangerous at times; several batsmen were injured. New Zealand's captain for this match, Arnold Williams, was the highest scorer on either side, with 72 not out in the second innings; Ernest Upham took 6 for 84 and 1 for 51, and Arthur Fisher 4 for 25 and 5 for 61. For MCC, Douglas took 7 for 49 and 5 for 75, giving him 21 wickets at an average of 10.52 in the two matches against New Zealand.\nLeading players.\nIn the first-class matches Johnson was the highest scorer, with 546 runs at an average of 32.11. Douglas had the best batting average, with 398 runs at 36.18. Eight batsmen averaged 24 or more.\nDouglas took the most wickets and had the best bowling average: 50 wickets at 13.26. His opening partner May took 45 at 15.97, Branston took 36 at 18.69, and the underarm bowler Simpson-Hayward took 35 at 16.88. No one else took more than six wickets. In all matches Douglas took 84 wickets at 10.34.\nAssessments.\nThe tour was not a financial success, leaving the New Zealand Cricket Council to make up the deficit and casting doubt over the viability of future tours by overseas teams."

        "text": "The West Indies cricket team toured New Zealand from 6 February 1980 to 5 March 1980, playing 3 Tests and 1 One Day Internationals against New Zealand. The West Indies were coming after their first test series win on Australian soil. However, Vivian Richards who scored 400 runs in the Australian tour returned home with a sore back. As a result, New Zealand won the test series 1-0 as well as the only ODI by 1 wicket.\nThe series is remembered for West Indian complaints about the standard of umpiring, which led to a number of on-field incidents in the three Test matches. This series was the West Indies' last defeat in a Test match series until 1994–95.\nTouring team.\nThe West Indies Cricket Board of Control named the 16 players to tour Australia and New Zealand on 27 September 1979.\nTour matches.\nThe West Indies' first game of the tour was against Northern Districts on 3 February 1980. The three-day match ended in a draw after the West Indies finished up on 132/8, chasing 153. Gordon Greenidge made 116 for the West Indies in the first innings, the only century of the match.\nOne-day international.\nThe only limited overs match of the series was held on 6 February 1980. A close game, New Zealand won by 1 wicket with two balls remaining.\nTest series summary.\nFirst Test.\nThe First Test was scheduled over 8–13 February. The West Indies won the toss and elected to bat, where they made 140, Richard Hadlee taking 5-34 for New Zealand. New Zealand, braving the West Indies' renowned four-man pace attack, made 249 in their innings, a lead of 109. 105 from Desmond Haynes ensured New Zealand had to bat again, but the target of 104 appeared to be too little for the West Indies to defend. Nevertheless, determined bowling by the West Indies took the game to the wire, with New Zealand at one stage reduced to 54/7. New Zealand eventually won by one wicket after their number 10 and 11 batsmen scored the winning runs off a leg bye. The exciting finish was overshadowed, however, by West Indian complaints of poor umpiring throughout the match. Michael Holding had kicked the stumps in frustration after having an appeal turned down in New Zealand's second innings, an action which was assured of worldwide attention when it was captured by a newspaper photographer at the grounds. After the match, the West Indies' manager, Willie Rodriguez, complained, \"We got two men out and they were not given. They were atrocious decisions.\"\nThe West Indies then played their nest tour match against Wellington (see above) on 16 February. The low-scoring game was won by Wellington by 6 wickets.\nSecond Test.\nThe Second Test was held over 22–27 February. The match ended in a draw with the West Indies on 447/5 in their second innings, a lead of 215 after having been behind by 232 in the first innings. The match was more renowned for tensions between the West Indians and the New Zealand umpires coming to a head. At tea on the third day, the West Indies refused to return to the field until the New Zealand umpire Fred Goodall was replaced. After being convinced by New Zealand captain Geoff Howarth to return to the field, the West Indians resumed play after a 12-minute delay. Nevertheless, the West Indians began packing their bags after the day's play with the apparent intention of abandoning the Test and series and returning home. This option was forbidden, however, by the chairman of the West Indian Cricket Board, Jeff Stollmeyer. On the fourth day, West Indian anger again spilled over when bowler Colin Croft shoulder-barged Goodall in his run-up; when Goodall complained to Lloyd, Lloyd made Goodall walk up to him by not moving from his position in the slips. Croft and Lloyd maintained after the series that the shoulder-barging had been an accident, although New Zealand captain Howarth disputed this.\nThird Test.\nThe third and final Test of the series was held over 29 February to 5 March. Again ending in a draw, New Zealand were left on 73/4 chasing 180 at stumps on the fifth day. While not reaching the heights of the Second Test, the match was still marred by some controversy when four senior West Indian players indicated that they would be catching flights home at lunch on the final day, substitute fielders taking their places for the remaining sessions. The players involved were persuaded out of this action.\nAftermath.\nWhat was from a spectator's perspective a remarkable series—a closely fought 1-0 victory by lowly New Zealand against the then unofficial cricket world champions—was marred by acrimony and complaints from the teams involved. The West Indies maintained their bitterness towards the umpiring after the series, with Rodriguez complaining that the umpiring had not been biased so much as incompetent and that the West Indies had been \"set up; that there was no way we could win a Test.\" Lloyd later conceded, however, that he should have taken a firmer line with his players and that some of the incidents had not been in the best interests of the game. New Zealand's Goodall, however—the principal target of the West Indies' anger—compounded the bitterness by allegedly making racist comments about the West Indies at an after-dinner speech following the series.\nCricket-wise, the series was a watershed for both teams—the West Indies would go on to establish a record unbeaten run in Test match series until 1994–95, while the victory heralded the emergence of New Zealand's best Test team.\nExternal sources.\nCricinfo tour directory"

        "text": "The Australian cricket team toured New Zealand in the 1985–86 season to play a three-match Test series and four-match one day series against New Zealand after NZ had toured Australia earlier in the season.\nNew Zealand won the series 1–0 with two matches drawn. It was the first time they had beaten Australia at home in a test series, and meant they retained the Trans-Tasman Trophy.\nThe one day series was drawn 2-2.\nAustralian squad.\nAustralia had just lost to New Zealand 2–1 at home during the 1985–86 season and were lucky to draw 0–0 against India. The team was greatly weakened by defections to the South African rebel tours. However they had just finished the home summer on a high note, having defeated India and New Zealand in the 1985–86 triangular one-day series. Allan Border was confident the team would win the one day series and bring back the Trans-Tasman Trophy.\nThe original squad selected was selected by Laurie Sawle, Greg Chappell, Jim Higgs and Dick Guy. It consisted of:\nOn-tour selectors: Border, Bright, Marsh\nWayne B. Phillips had been Australia's first choice wicketkeeper for two years. However his form behind the stumps had fallen away and the Australian selectors picked him as a specialist batsman again, with specialist keeper Tim Zoehrer picked in the side as Australia's first-choice gloveman. During the tour, Zoehrer returned to Australia with an eye infection and Phillips became the keeper.\nGeoff Lawson was unavailable to play due to a back injury. Leg-spinner Bob Holland was overlooked for selection despite taking more first class wickets that summer than any other bowler. The writers of Wisden later argued this was a major mistake. Bill O'Reilly was delighted with the selections of Steve Waugh (\"one of the best selections in the whole era of Greg Chappell's career at the selection committee's wheel\") and Bruce Reid (\"strong claims to be recognised as the finest left-arm speedster we put on the international arena since Alan Davidson\"), but was disappointed in the selection of Ray Bright over Holland, and Greg Ritchie over Mark O'Neill:\nThis team is disappointing. There are not nearly enough rosy-cheeked new faces to beguile the eyes that have grown dim with the succession of recent disappointments. Australian cricket supporters not yet blinded and deafened by the one-day razzamatazz cannot be blamed for thinking that the four selectors have let this country down in a time of crisis.\nBob Simpson accompanied the side as an assistant manager/coach. He had been asked by Fred Bennett, the head of the Australian Cricket Board, if he was interested in taking on the job full-time. Steve Waugh later wrote that:I'm not sure who got the bigger shock during the first couple of training sessions on that tour: Simmo, due to the team's low intensity work ethic, or the players, who had never been exposed to his level of passion at practice.\nMatches.\nFirst Test.\nAustralia made their highest test match score of the summer. Border was booed by the crowd when he came out to bat.\nSecond Test.\nAllan Border scores a century in each innings, helping Australia recover from a collapse each time. Steve Waugh scores his first test half century. Martin Crowe was knocked out by a Bruce Reid bouncer and was taken to hospital for x-rays but returned to score a century.\nThird Test.\nA bad tempered match with allegations of cheating on both sides. Australia led by 56 runs in the first innings but collapsed badly in the second to be all out for 103. John Bracewell gets 10-106. Australia's bowlers only took two wickets in New Zealand's second innings as they reached 160. Steve Waugh later described this game as a \"terrible recurring nightmare\". Allan Border wrote that:\nIt hurt. It hurt because we'd gone to New Zealand full of hope. We were a promising and emerging young side, we'd worked damned hard and we'd played good cricket most of the time. But we'd lost. We'd lost again. Every setback was making it harder to maintain optimism about the future.\nThis caused Border to have doubts about whether he wanted to continue as Australian captain.\nOne Day Internationals.\nThe Rothmans Cup was drawn 2-2.\n1st ODI.\nAt a press conference in Christchurch before the second game, Allan Border threatened to resign if his team did not improve:\nI've given up speaking to them. I've said basically everything that possibly can be said to this bunch. I'm basically leaving it up to them now. They are going to show me if they really want to play for Australia and whether they really want to play under me. I'll find out over the next three games and my decision will be made as to my future as a captain and a player after that... I don't think it's my captaincy... but if we continue to lose, you've just got to start saying: \"Right, someone else has to come in and see if they can do something different.\" It just gets as simple as that. That's the way I see it. The fellows are not responding to me and that's that. I'll find out over the next three games if that's the case or not.\nVice-captain Ray Bright had a ninety-minute meeting with the rest of the players. He reported back that the players agreed they had been letting Border down and wanted him to continue as captain. New Zealand won the second game, but Australia showed improved effort and commitment. Australia managed to narrowly win the third match, and won the fourth comfortably.\n3rd ODI.\nAustralia won by 3 wickets with 3 balls remaining, due mostly to a sixth-wicket partnership stand of 86 between Steve Waugh and Wayne Phillips. Ray Bright was so overjoyed with the victory he smashed the stumps with his bat.\nSummary.\nThe brightest spots of the tour for Australia were the batting form of Allan Border, the consolidation of David Boon and Geoff Marsh as an opening batting combination, and the emergence of Steve Waugh and Greg Matthews as all rounders. However the bowling was poor and the Australian batting was prone to collapse.\nGreg Matthews was a constant target for the hostility of New Zealand crowds. During one game in Wellington a toilet was thrown on the field.\nTowards the end of the tour, Bob Simpson said the positives to come out of it for Australia were the opening partnership of Boon and Marsh, the batting of Border and Ritchie, the promise of Waugh and Matthews, and the bowling of Reid, McDermott, Davis and Gilbert, although he felt McDermott was an enigma. He also said the team were fortunate to have Ray Bright as vice captain since his \"attitude and application have been an inspiration to the whole touring party.\"\nThis tour marked the last time Wayne B. Phillips played for Australia – he was the only player who went to New Zealand who was not picked on the subsequent tour of India.\nSteve Waugh later wrote that \"in many ways, the [tour]... marked the beginning of a new era.\" Bob Simpson was appointed Australia's coach full-time, ushering in a greater degree of professionalism that helped Australia ultimately become the number one team in the world. Several players on this tour, such as Border, Marsh, Boon, McDermott and Waugh, were part of that journey."

        "text": "The Pakistan national cricket team toured New Zealand in the 1988–89 season, following its unsuccessful participation in the Benson and Hedges World Series Cup in Australia.\nThree Test matches were arranged with four One-day International matches. In the event, the first Test at Dunedin was rained off, and an extra ODI was put on for what would have been the Test's fourth day. The two Tests that were played were both drawn, and New Zealand won four ODIs against one for the Pakistanis.\nAccording to Wisden, the tour was played in some acrimony. The touring side was led by Imran Khan who replaced Javed Miandad at a late stage, and several other players in the originally named touring party were also changed. Once in New Zealand, the tour was beset by umpiring controversies and disputed decisions.\nTouring team.\nMohsin Kamal was part of the team in Australia but left when Saleem Jaffer joined the party in New Zealand.\nTest matches.\nFirst Test match, Carisbrook, Dunedin, 3–7 February 1989.\nTorrential rain forced the match to be called off with no play after three days. The teams had not even tossed. An extra One-day International match was played on what would have been the Test match's fourth day.\nSecond Test match, Basin Reserve, Wellington, 10–14 February 1989.\nDescribed by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack as a \"dreadfully dull draw\", the match was dominated by unadventurous batting from both sides on a bland pitch. Only Andrew Jones escaped Wisden's strictures. His 86 out of 149 on the first was made in just under three-and-a-half hours: \"unseemly haste for such a grave occasion\", Wisden said. Martin Crowe took just under 10 hours to score 174 and the New Zealand first innings took up the first two days. Pakistan then went even more slowly. Shoaib Mohammad took 12 hours to make 163, then the sixth longest innings of all time anywhere and the longest-ever in New Zealand. Javed Miandad's 118 and Imran Khan's 71 were fast by comparison. After Pakistan declared nine behind on the last morning, New Zealand moved serenely to 107 for one before a collapse in the face of swerve and pace from Imran and Saleem Jaffar, whose five for 40 was his best Test performance. But a result never looked likely.\nThird Test match, Eden Park, Auckland, 24–28 February 1989.\nAnother slow Test, but not as slow as Wellington, saw Pakistan amass the highest total ever against a New Zealand side. Shoaib's 112 took six hours, but the highlight was Javed Miandad's 271, made in 558 minutes and his sixth Test double-century. Aamer Malik, Saleem Malik and Imran Khan also contributed useful runs. New Zealand's attack was weakened by injury to Richard Hadlee and Stephen Boock conceded 229 runs, a record for a New Zealand bowler. Imran batted on to lunch on the third day in the hope that the pitch would disintegrate in favour of his spinners. But although Abdul Qadir took six wickets for 160, six New Zealand Batsmen passed 30 and the final total failed only by 14 runs to avoid the follow-on. With rain and bad light intervening, the match petered out to a draw.\nOne Day Internationals (ODIs).\nWhen the Dunedin Test was washed out, a replacement One-Day International was arranged for the scheduled fourth day of the match. This did not count towards the Rothmans Cup ODI Series.\nDunedin Test Replacement ODI.\nNew Zealand won the Rothmans Cup 3–1."

        "title": "Indian cricket team in New Zealand in 1993–94",
        "text": "The India national cricket team toured New Zealand from 10 March to 2 April 1994, playing only one Test match, which was drawn. In addition to it, the team played two first-class games and four ODIs. India's 24-day tour began with two first-class fixtures, against New Zealand Emerging Players XI and New Zealand Academy, both of which ended in draws. The one-off Test and the ODI series that followed also ended in draws, the latter seeing India win two matches and New Zealand two.\nBackground.\nThe India squad for the tour left for New Zealand on 6 March 1994. The touring party also included manager Ajit Wadekar and administrative manager Ranga Reddy. A day prior to departure, the team had played a charity game against World XI in New Delhi. Having last played in New Zealand four years before, the tour was the first for spinners Anil Kumble and Rajesh Chauhan, wicket-keeper Nayan Mongia, and medium-pacer Salil Ankola. Since the series defeat in that tour, the team had won Test series in different tours both home and away. Under the captaincy of Mohammad Azharuddin, the side also had a particularly successful previous season.\nHowever, New Zealand entered the Test on the back of a series defeat at home against Pakistan, despite winning the final Test. They had also won the final ODI and tying another in the ODI series that followed. It was reported that Richard Hadlee who had retired from professional cricket and serving as a commentator during the time was asked by Pakistan former cricketer Imran Khan to come out of retirement to play the India series.\nSquads.\nA 14-member India squad for the tour was announced in early March 1994. Venkatesh Prasad was called up to replace Manoj Prabhakar, who fractured his heel, a few days prior to start of the Test. New Zealand announced its squad for the Test on 13 March. Changes from the side that lost a Test series to Pakistan a few weeks prior, included wicket-keeper Tony Blain who was replaced by Adam Parore, Chris Cairns by Dion Nash and Andrew Jones who retired from Tests, making way for Stephen Fleming, then a Canterbury player, who was the only new addition to the squad.\nTour matches.\nThree-day: New Zealand Emerging Players XI v Indians.\nIndia fielded a team without vice-captain Sachin Tendulkar for the match, who was ruled out after he had a boil on his left hand punctured. The New Zealand Emerging Players XI included players who were on the edge of selection for the Test side, except for Blair Hartland who already played for the latter team as an opener. He top-scored for the Emerging Players XI with 98 off 200 balls after his team winning the toss elected to bat; he batted for four-and-a-half hours. Javagal Srinath picked up two wickets despite the pitch not offering much for seamers. Kapil Dev, who had a stiff neck, was not used. The batting side went to stumps at 233/4. In reply, the Indians made 352 with Manoj Prabhakar making 147 off 258 deliveries and Sanjay Manjrekar, 134 off 237, while the others made negligible contributions. The Emerging Players XI had Michael Owens and MF Sharpe bowling well with the second new ball, while others bowled ordinarily, except for Grant Bradburn, who combined with Owens to dismiss the Indians' lower order. Day 3, the final day, ended with the New Zealand Emerging Players XI having made 236/2, in their second innings.\nThree-day: New Zealand Academy v Indians.\nSachin Tendulkar, who led the Indians while Mohammad Azharuddin rested, won the toss and put the New Zealand Academy to bat under overcast conditions and moisty pitch. Javagal Srinath of the Indians troubled the New Zealand Academy openers early on with movement off the seam. After having been turned down for lbw, the academy went to lunch at 46/0 before losing two wickets at tea. Opener Blair Pocock however carried on and reached his fourth first-class century at stumps taking his team's total to 171/4. His team declared at lunch with the score at 253/5 with Pocock himself remaining unbeaten at 139. The Indians were 96/1 at stumps with opener Ajay Jadeja unbeaten at 55, characterized by attacking strokeplay, at the crease. The match ended in a draw after no play was possible on the third and final day due to rain."

        "text": "The India national cricket team toured New Zealand from 7 December 1998 to 19 January 1999 and played a three-match Test series against New Zealand. New Zealand won the series 1–0. The two teams also played a 5-match ODI series that ended in a 2–2 draw.\nBackground.\nIndia came into New Zealand with a poor away record. They had won just one Test away from home since 1986, and not won a series in New Zealand since 1968. Most recently, they had lost away to Zimbabwe in a one-off Test.\nFrom 35 meetings between the two sides, New Zealand had won six, lost 13, and drawn 16 Tests. Going into the Test series, India had five batsmen ranked inside the top 20 of the ICC Men's Player Rankings, three of who averaged over 50. On the other hand, New Zealand had only one batsman averaging above 40, Craig McMillan, and that from only eight Tests. \"The Christchurch Press\" wrote, \"Where the Black Caps achieve parity and should have an advantage at home is in the bowling ranks. Leg-spinner Anil Kumble and seam bowler Javagal Srinath are the cornerstones of India's bowling attack, while Venkatesh Prasad should develop further in New Zealand conditions. But India's back-up spin bowling resources are barely tried... [t]hrough Chris Cairns, Dion Nash and Shayne O'Connor, there is wicket-taking prowess.\"\nSquads.\nIndia's 15-man Test squad for the tour was announced in November 1998. Harbhajan Singh, Navjot Singh Sidhu and Debashish Mohanty who were excluded from the side for the ICC KnockOut Trophy and tri-series earlier that year, were recalled. The New Zealand Test squad was named on 8 December. Paceman Geoff Allott made a comeback into the squad for the third time and was included ahead of Shayne O'Connor as he offered \"more pace and bounce\". 21-year-old batsman Matthew Bell was added for the first time. O'Connor was later added to the squad after Simon Doull was ruled out with a strained calf. Roger Twose was included to their side for the Third Test replacing an injured Nathan Astle."

        "title": "English cricket team in India in 1992–93",
        "text": "The English cricket team toured India during January, February and March 1993. The tour was beset by controversy over England's poor performances and results, with selection, tour management, the Indian cuisine and climate, airport industrial action and even players' facial hair being blamed for the lack of success.\nAs far as squad selection was concerned, the primary focus was the omission of David Gower, who had averaged over 50 in the previous summer's series against Pakistan. His replacement was Dermot Reeve who ended up not even featuring in the Test series. The official reason for leaving Gower out of the squad was that he was \"too old\", but with veterans Mike Gatting and John Emburey also making the trip, despite having only just returned from a ban for playing cricket in apartheid South Africa, this seemed rather spurious. Questions about it were even raised in Parliament and a special general meeting of the MCC convened, but to no effect, and Gower's presence in India was as a media representative only. Buried beneath this furore was the additional omission of Jack Russell, considered by most to be England's best wicketkeeper, in favour of the largely unheralded Richard Blakey.\nIndian captain Mohammad Azharuddin was also under considerable pressure heading into the series, after a poor tour of South Africa that led to the Indian media questioning his captaincy, but the tone changed after his match-winning performance in the first Test.\nIndia won the Test series 3–0, keeping the same eleven throughout, and the One Day International series was drawn three games apiece.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nSpeculation about the future of Azharuddin as captain was quelled as he guided India from a slightly wobbly 93/3 to a defendable 371. His innings of 182 was supported by Sachin Tendulkar, Pravin Amre and Kapil Dev, with whom he added 123, 62, and 68 respectively. None of the England bowlers looked threatening, and the decision to omit a second front-line spinner in order to play four seamers looked flawed, especially when Gooch finally turned to Graeme Hick and he ended up with three wickets, including Azharuddin's.\nEngland's batting was insipid. The top order failed miserably, slumping to 40/4 and 89/6, but the tail worked hard and Ian Salisbury came close to saving the follow-on after a three-hour stay at the crease for 28. Second time around, they offered up more defiance, Alec Stewart and Mike Gatting showing some form, but insufficient to set India a challenging total. Again, Salisbury (26) batted well, and was supported for more than an hour and a half by Paul Taylor, but ultimately to no avail.\nIndia had a couple of scares on their way to the 79 that they needed to win, with Hick picking up two more wickets (Sidhu and Prabhakar), but never looked in any serious danger of collapsing.\nVinod Kambli and Rajesh Chauhan made their debuts for India in this match. This was Graham Gooch's 100th Test match.\n2nd Test.\nEngland's plans for the second Test were put awry by captain Gooch succumbing to a dodgy prawn curry the night before the match. Robin Smith was promoted to open the batting with Alec Stewart, who was relieved of wicketkeeping duties by Richard Blakey. Phil Tufnell came into the side, despite a lack of form.\nIndia won the toss as proceeded to capitalise on the visitors' shortcomings, racking up 275/2 on the first day, including a century from Navjot Sidhu. Sachin Tendulkar also went on to make a big century (165) on the second day and played some sublime strokes, including three boundaries in five balls from Malcolm to bring up his hundred, with further support from Amre (78) and Kapil Dev (66*), as India declared on 560/6, then their highest score against England.\nUnfortunately for Mike Gatting, the innings was also notable for his dropping of what has been regarded as one of the easiest missed catches at all time. Fielding at silly point off Ian Salisbury, Gatting was left groping at thin air after batsman Kiran More popped up a simple chance to him.\nIn reply, England lost Smith early, but Stewart (74) and Hick (64) batted solidly, adding 113 for the second wicket. Again though, England collapsed, from 157/2 to 220/7, and only Fairbrother's 83 made the total a respectable 286, but even that wasn't sufficient to avoid the follow-on. The spinners starred for India, bowling all but 7 overs in the innings, and taking all 9 wickets that fell to bowlers, with Raju (4–103) the pick. The story was similar in the second innings – Smith's 56 held together an otherwise flaky top order, which slumped to 99/6 before Chris Lewis took the attack back to the bowlers, finally delivering on the promise that many had seen for years. Lewis and Salisbury added 73, and Lewis and Tufnell another 56, but neither of these partnership were sufficient to prevent England losing by an innings. Lewis's innings of 117, which included two sixes and 15 fours, was his maiden Test century. Kumble picked up six wickets as he winkled most of the England batsmen out, while Kapil Dev set the tone by ripping out Stewart and Hick for ducks at the top of the order.\n3rd Test.\nEngland's decision to go into the final Test of the series with just four specialist bowlers (Phillip DeFreitas, Lewis, Tufnell and John Emburey) looked justified when Gooch won the toss and elected to bat. Jarvis, Malcolm and Salisbury were dropped, and Fairbrother was unwell and unable to play, so in came Atherton, Emburey, DeFreitas and the fit-again Gooch. Blakey retained his place behind the stumps so that Stewart could once again open the batting. India kept faith with the same team that had won the first two tests convincingly.\nEngland were soon in trouble though, at 58/4, and then 118/6 as wickets once again fell in clusters. Once Hick and Lewis (49) (demoted to number eight) were together though, batting looked an awful lot easier, as they put on 93 for the next wicket, and only started to get bogged down once the ball began turning more sharply. Hick manipulated the tail masterfully though, and eked out a further 51 with Emburey and 68 with Tufnell (2*), before being the last man out, taken by a marvelous running catch by Kapil Dev for a Test career-best 178.\nIn reply, India made a positive start. Prabhakar and Sidhu added 109 for the first wicket, and when that fell it only brought Vinod Kambli to the crease. He and Tendulkar (78), two local boys, delighted the fans in adding 196 for the third wicket, batting together for almost the whole day on a slow wicket and seemingly carving boundaries from the bowling at will. Kambli also received great support from another Bombay-based player, Amre (57), with whom he added 101, but eventually fell to Lewis for a magnificent 224, as India racked up a massive 591.\nSet 244 to avoid an innings defeat, England started badly again. Prabhakar took the wickets of the top three batsmen, reducing the visitors to 34/3, and they never really recovered despite half-centuries from Smith and Gatting, and 47 from Hick. The tail was unable to demonstrate the same resilience as in the first innings, only DeFreitas making double figures, and the Test series ended on a whimper for England when DeFreitas was stumped off Raju still sixteen runs short of making India bat a second time.\nThis marked just the second time that India had won three Tests in a series (the previous occasion being in New Zealand in 1967–68).\nODI series.\n2nd ODI.\nEngland needed 19 to win of the last two overs and got there off the final ball, two missed run-out attempts in the final over costing India dear. Kambli scored a hundred on his 21st birthday."

        "title": "Bangladeshi cricket team in Australia in 2003",
        "text": "The Bangladesh national cricket team played two Test matches and three One Day International (ODI) matches on a mid-year tour of Australia in 2003. They were captained by all-rounder Khaled Mahmud. The Australians were under a split captaincy—Steve Waugh in the Tests and Ricky Ponting in the following ODIs. The series marked the first time a Test match had been played outside an Australian state capital city; with matches played at Bundaberg Rum Stadium in Cairns, and the newly upgraded Marrara Oval in Darwin.\nAustralia easily won the two-match Test series. Bangladesh's performances' did not get any better during the ODI series—failing to score more than 147 in any innings—as Australia completed a clean-sweep.\nBackground.\nBangladesh had struggled to come to terms with International cricket since becoming the tenth Test team in November 2000. Before their 2003 tour of Australia, Bangladesh had only one Test draw, which came against lowly ranked Zimbabwe, and not a single Test win. Their One Day International (ODI) form had also been poor since their historic victory over Pakistan in the 1999 Cricket World Cup. The victory subsequently paved the way for their admission to Test cricket. In Bangladesh's last series before Australia, they were defeated by an innings in both matches by South Africa. Australia, however, had a 3–1 away Test victory—starting in April—against the West Indies, and a 4–3 ODI victory over the same opposition. Earlier in the year, they remained unbeaten (10 matches) in winning the 2003 ODI Cricket World Cup in South Africa. Led by Ricky Ponting, Australia defeated India in the final, despite losing leg-spiner Shane Warne. Prior to the start of the World Cup, Warne—Australia's highest Test wicket-taker—was sent home from South Africa after a drug test during the recent one-day series in Australia returned a positive result for a banned diuretic. He was consequently banned from International and first-class cricket for a year.\nThe day before the first Test, former Australian batsman David Hookes said Bangladesh were not worthy of Test status. He also indicated that Australia could win either Test within a day.\nTest series.\nFirst Test.\nMarrara Oval became the 89th Test venue—and the eighth in Australia. On a slow and low drop-in pitch airlifted from Melbourne a month before the match, Australia won the toss and elected to field. Bangladesh collapsed and were bowled out for 97 within three hours, with only Mohammad Ashraful (23) and Khaled Mahmud (21) providing resistance. All four Australian bowlers chimed in, as Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee took three wickets apiece. McGrath and Jason Gillespie surpassed the duo of Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall as Australia's most successful opening-bowling combination. Bangladesh's shot selection did not impress coach Dav Whatmore who said, \"A few players presented their wickets and that's just the area we're trying to improve.\" Australia initially struggled to come to terms with the pitch, falling to 2/43 when Ricky Ponting was dismissed for 10. Darren Lehmann started the carnage, scoring his second Test century (110). Steve Waugh then became only the second player after Gary Kirsten to score a century against all Test playing nations. Upon reaching the milestone, he promptly declared Australia's innings on 7/407. Only Bangladesh's fastest bowler, Mashrafe Mortaza proved threatening, taking three wickets for 74 runs (3/74) in 23 overs. After the days play, Lehmann said, \"It was hard work out there. They stuck to their guns pretty well, they put it in the right areas and made it tough to score runs.\" When asked about becoming only the second batsman to score a hundred against all nine Test-playing nations, Waugh said:\nThe Bangladeshis—needing 310 runs to make Australia bat again—counterattacked before the conclusion of day two. Despite losing Javed Omar, leg before wicket to McGrath for five, opening batsman Hannan Sarkar and their leading International run-scorer, Habibul Bashar took the score to 89. The pair scored at a run-rate of 3.98 runs per over, before the partnership was ended when Sarkar was caught behind for 35. This sparked a collapse, with Bangladesh bowled out for 178. Australian leg spinner Stuart MacGill took 5/65—his seventh Test five-wicket haul—as Australia won by an innings and 132 runs. Along with being named man of the match, Waugh overtook West Indian Clive Lloyd as the most successful captain in Test history, enjoying his 37th victory.\nSecond Test.\nBundaberg Rum Stadium became the 90th Test venue—and the ninth in Australia. According to Wisden, \" ... Rain had left question marks about the quality of the pitch, which looked green and enticing for the Australian fast bowlers.\" When Australia won the toss and sent Bangladesh into bat, there were fears Bangladesh would struggle to score 100 in either innings. On a surface which \"played much better than expected,\" and was a \"much faster pitch than that in Darwin,\" Sarkar scored 76, hitting nine boundaries in the process. He and Bashar put on 108 for second wicket as the Australian bowlers lacked penetration. Omar (26), Bashar (46), Sanwar Hossain (46) and Khaled Mashud (44) all got starts, but could not continue their good work as Bangladesh were eventually bowled out for 295 early on the second morning. MacGill took another five-wicket haul as the rest of the bowlers apart from Gillespie had limited success, with Waugh bowling himself for five overs in search of a breakthrough. Despite Langer (1) falling early, Hayden (50) and Ponting (59) both scored half-centuries, taking Australia to 2/105. Both Lehmann and Waugh continued with their Darwin form, scoring 177 and 156 respectively. This was Waugh's 32nd Test century, taking him ahead of Sachin Tendulkar and behind only Sunil Gavaskar (34). Lehmann's innings included 105 runs between tea and the close of play on day two. When eventually dismissed, Martin Love compiled his first Test century. With 2/128, Hossain was the only bowler who took more than one wicket. His suspect bowling action would later be reported to the International Cricket Council.\nSarkar scored another half-century in Bangladesh's second innings before succumbing to a 'wild swipe' off MacGill. The leg-spinner took his third five-wicket haul in as many innings and Gillespie took three wickets in the space of eight balls. Despite being dismissed for 163, Waugh thought Bangladesh's batting was \"a lot better than a lot of efforts by the West Indies in recent years and Pakistan in Sharjah.\" Despite two centuries from Lehmann and Waugh, MacGill was named man of the series, with 17 wickets. Whatmore was also pleased with the Bangladesh improvement between Tests.\nOne Day series.\n1st ODI.\nAfter putting Bangladesh into bat, the Australians soon took early wickets. On a pitch that was quicker than the Test strip, Bangladesh looked all at sea against the pace of Lee and Gillespie. They soon crashed to 4/19 and never recovered, eventually bowled out for 105 in the 34th over. Only three batsmen managed double figures as the pace duo took seven wickets between them. Andy Bichel also chimed in with 2/24.\nBecause of Bangladesh's meagre batting performance, the Australian innings began before lunch and opener Adam Gilchrist scored a typically quick-fire 18 before he was caught behind from Mortaza. Hayden (46) and Ponting then got valuable batting practice as they shared a 74-run partnership. Ponting was eventually bowled by Rafique for 29. Damien Martyn's stay at the crease was cut short, in his first International match since breaking his finger in the 2003 Cricket World Cup, he faced just one ball before Australia won by eight wickets with more than 27 overs to spare. Along with the wicket of Ponting, Rafique conceded just seven runs in five overs.\n2nd ODI.\nThe Bangladeshis won the toss and elected to bat. Their openers put on a steady opening partnership, before Sarkar (who was now playing as a wicket-keeper in the absence of Khaled Mashud) was caught behind off Ian Harvey for 19, with the score at 37 after 14 overs. His opening partner, Javed Omar, fell nine runs later, for 11. Hossain also came and went quickly, as Bangladesh were restricted to 3/52, despite surviving Lee's spell. Only Bashar (31) offered any sort of resistance, as the middle order crumbled under the spin of Brad Hogg, who took 3/31. Alok Kapali provided some lower-order entertainment, striking 34 from 44 balls. Lehmann finished off the tail, collecting 3/16, as Bangladesh were dismissed for 147 in the 46th over.\nIn the absence of Bangladesh's opening bowler, Mortaza, Australia opened the innings with Andrew Symonds and Michael Bevan— giving the usual middle-order batsmen time at the crease. The Symonds experiment did not last long, as he was dismissed by Hasibul Hossain for seven. Martyn joined Bevan at the crease and quickly put the bowlers on the back foot with aggressive batting. Despite returning in the series for the first time since the 2003 Cricket World Cup because of a broken finger, he scored Australia's second fastest ODI half-century—22 balls—and was on track to overtake Gilchrist's and Allan Border's record for the fastest Australian ODI century; 78 deliveries. Together they added 131 runs from 91 balls, seeing Australia home by nine wickets. Named man of the match, Martyn finished with 92 from 51 balls, dominating the partnership with Bevan, who scored 40 from 62 balls. Martyn was especially severe on Bangladeshi captain Khaled Mahmud, hitting three fours and a six from successive balls in Mahmud's second over. The captain finished with the unflattering figures of 0/34 from three overs.\n3rd ODI.\nThe series finished in Darwin, with Australian skipper Ricky Ponting winning the toss and electing to bat. They were restricted to 4/114—partly due to the tight bowling of Rafique who picked up two wickets—before the Australian captain stabilised the innings. He scored a composed century, as he and Bevan put on a run-a-ball 127 run stand. Strangely, Ponting's 14th ODI century, included only two fours, despite hitting four sixes. Australia finished on 7/254 from their 50 overs. On return, Mortaza took two late innings wickets; however, the rest of the bowling (apart from Rafique and Kapali) again lacked penetration.\nThanks to some tight bowling, Bangladesh slumped to 5/36. Both Bashar (2) and Mohammad Ashraful (4) were dismissed charging Bichel and Harvey respectively, before Kapali compiled a determined 49 in a 66 run sixth-wicket partnership with Hossain. These shots were possibly caused by tight bowling from Jason Gillespie, who took 1/16 in 10 overs. Bangladesh were bowled out for 142 in the 48th over, with Ian Harvey taking four for 16. Ponting received the man of the match and series awards, as Australia won by 112 runs. According to cricket historian Gideon Haigh, \"Almost a quarter of the combined populations of Cairns and Darwin attended the cricket\" during the Test and ODI series."

In his sophomore season, Butler was catching passes from quarterback Steve Fuller and was part of a receiving core that included Joey Walters and Dwight Clark. During the 1976 season, Butler caught 33 passes for 484 yards and four touchdowns. However, Clemson still languished in the basement of the ACC, going 0-4-1 in conference play. The next season, Red Parker was out as head coach and Charley Pell was named to replace him. Butler emerged as Fuller's primary target. In his junior season, Butler caught 43 passes for 760 yards and four touchdowns. Clemson improved under Pell, and finally, Butler was part of a winning college football program. In 1978, Butler was part of the Clemson squad that won the ACC championship. However, before the Gator Bowl, head coach Charley Pell bolted to take the Florida head coaching position and assistant Danny Ford took over. Butler caught 4 passes for 44 yards and no scores in the Gator Bowl. However, this game is more remember for the final two minutes of the game more than anything that transpired prior. This was the game in which Tigers linebacker Charlie Baumann intercepted an errant Art Schlichter pass, and later punched by Ohio State head coach Woody Hayes.\nDuring the 1977, Butler was part of one of the infamous games in the Clemson/South Carolina rivalry. clemson needed to beat the Gamecocks, who were 5-5 and eliminated from bowl contention. If South Carolina won, they'd derail Clemson's bid to get into the Gator bowl and have their first Bowl appearance since 1959. Up 24–0, Clemson began to falter, and South Carolina pulled within four points. The score was 24–20 when South Carolina quarterback Ron Bass found Phil Logan on a 4th and 10 play that results in a 40-yard touchdown strike and a Gamecocks 27–24 lead. After the Clemson drive had brought the Tigers to the Gamecocks 18 yard line, thanks in part to a Fuller to Clark pass, the Tigers tried to run a hurry up play. However, the Gamecocks managed to get pressure on Fuller, causing him to release the pass quicker than he wanted to. Fuller released the awkward pass, which was hauled in by Butler, who'd make a twisting leap for the ball. He caught the ball in the end zone for the score, securing what would be a 31–27 win over South Carolina. The play would go down in Clemson/South Carolina lore as \"The Catch\".\nPro career.\nButler was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in the first round of the 1979 NFL Draft, being the fifth player overall taken. His Clemson teammate Steve Fuller was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the same round, 23rd overall. Butler beat out Lou Piccone for the starting role opposite Frank Lewis. In his rookie season, Butler caught 48 passes for 834 yards and four touchdowns as the Bills, led by head coach Chuck Knox finished 7–9. In Week Four of his rookie season, the Bills were losing to their AFC East rival, the New York Jets when the Ferguson/Butler combo lead the Bills to a 75- and 74-yard score to take a lead the Bills would never surrender on their way to a 46–31 win. Butler had 255 yards receiving in the game, a record that would stand for 25 years until it was broken by Lee Evans in a game against the Houston Texans. The next season, Butler and Bills quarterback Joe Ferguson helped lead the Bills to an 11–5 record and a division title. Though the season ended in a divisional playoff loss to the San Diego Chargers, Butler was named to his first and only Pro Bowl.\nAfter a stellar 1981 season, the 1982 season was disrupted by a work stoppage brought on by the NFL players strike. It seemed as if Butler was going to pick up where he left off during the 1983 season, until Week Nine against the New Orleans Saints. In the first quarter, Butler caught a 16-yard TD strike from Ferguson in a game the Bills would go on to win 27–21. However, Butler injured his knee in the game and would miss not only the rest of the 1983 season, but the entire 1984 season as well.\nButler made a comeback in 1985. He started 13 games that season, opposite Andre Reed. Butler caught 41 passes for 770 yards and 2 touchdowns. Midway through the 1986 season, Hank Bullough was fired as head coach, and replaced by Marv Levy. On November 16, 1986, Butler caught a touchdown pass from Bills quarterback Jim Kelly, but came down wrong on his ankle, and shattered it. Butler laid on the turf in the end zone as his teammates and Dolphins players each took a knee. The cart was brought out and Butler was placed on it, leaving the field for the final time as an active player. Despite multiple surgeries, Butler was unable to comeback and was forced to retire. Butler established himself as a community leader. He was the Buffalo Bills- NFL “Man of Year” in 1981 and 1982, and Buffalo Bills Ed Block Courage Award recipient in 1985.\nFront office, awards and achievements.\nIn 2019, Butler won the Brian Dawkins Lifetime Achievement Award, which honors former Clemson players for their leadership not just on the field, but in the community as well. In 2015, Butler was hired by the Chicago Bears as their director of player development. Butler had also held front office positions with the Bills, Cleveland Browns, Denver Broncos and was a receivers coach for a season with the Browns. Just two years later, Butler retired from football, and left his position with the Bears.\nIn 1986, Butler was named to the Clemson Tigers Hall of Fame. Ten years later, he was named to Clemson's Centennial team, and finally, in 1998, he was named to Clemson's Ring of Honor."

        "text": "Donald Ray Woods (born February 17, 1951) is a former American football running back who played for the San Diego Chargers and San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League (NFL) from 1974 to 1980.\nCollege career.\nWoods attended New Mexico Highlands University for college before transferring to the University of New Mexico his senior year when New Mexico Highlands dropped their football program. He was a mobile quarterback for the Lobos, leading the team with both 869 yards on 52 of 124 passes, and 971 yards on 220 rushes for 11 touchdowns, and winning the team's MVP award. In a game against rival New Mexico St., he rushed for 188 yards, at the time the fourth most in school history, for which he won the UPI Back of the Week award on Sept. 15, 1973. He also both rushed and passed for 100+ yards in the same game twice, against Utah (100 and 134) and Colorado St. (148 and 128).\nProfessional career.\nWoods was selected in the 6th Round of the 1974 NFL Draft by the Green Bay Packers. Green Bay released Woods at the end of training camp and he was subsequently picked up by the Chargers early in the 1974 season. He was used almost exclusively as a running back, despite playing quarterback in college (albeit one who ran almost twice as often as passed). The move proved very fruitful for San Diego, as Woods, despite not suiting up until the 3rd week of the season, went on to set a then-NFL-rookie-rushing-record of 1,162 yards in only 12 games, including a then-rookie-record seven 100-yard rushing performances (weeks 3,4,5,7,10,12, and 14). Woods was selected the 1974 NFL Rookie of the Year. His seven rushing touchdowns and 96.8 rushing yards per game remain Chargers franchise rookie records, and his 1,162 rushing and 1,511 yards from scrimmage are second only to the numbers LaDainian Tomlinson put up in 2001.\nA knee injury slowed Woods down during the 1975 campaign and while having several solid years with the Chargers, was never able to recapture the electricity of his rookie campaign. Woods was eventually phased out of the Chargers offense and traded to San Francisco during the 1980 season, finishing out his career that season with the 49ers. Woods finished his career with 3,087 career rushing yards and scored a total of 21 touchdowns. As of November 2021, Woods remains number 8 on the all-time Chargers rushing list."

        "text": "Gary Green (born August 23, 1953 in Tillsonburg, Ontario) is a former head coach of the Washington Capitals and hockey television analyst. He was previously the head coach and GM of the OHA Peterborough Petes (1977–79) and coach of the AHL Hershey Bears (1979–80). He won the OHA Coach of the Year award in 1978-79. When Green replaced Danny Belisle as head coach of the Capitals during the 1979–80 NHL season, he was 26, making him the youngest head coach in NHL history.\nAfter being fired by the Capitals in 1981, Green joined the USA Network as a colour commentator on their NHL telecasts, and remained there until 1985. In 1987, he joined TSN, where he stayed until 2004. With TSN, he covered college hockey, Canada Cup Hockey, TSN Hockey and IIHF events, notably the World Junior Championships and World Championships, and national hockey telecasts on TSN along with Jim Hughson and Paul Romanuk. He also covered the NHL Entry Draft from 1990 to 1998. In 1995, he also worked on a few NHL telecasts for Fox. In addition to national television duties, he acted as a colour commentator for regional TV broadcasts of the Winnipeg Jets (1985–1996) and Montreal Canadiens (1998–2002).\nHe later coached the Canadian entry at the Spengler Cup tournament in Davos, Switzerland, and provided analysis for the NHL Network and NHL Radio."

Nicks played sparingly in his first season, averaging 2.2 ppg in 24 games played. In academic trouble with a 1.6 GPA, Bob King, the head coach, recommended that Nicks leave the Sycamores and go to a junior college to work on his academic and basketball skills. He spent the 1977–78 season at Gulf Coast Community College in Panama City, Florida, where he averaged 22.4 ppg. Nicks credited the experience, stating, \"I wanted to play basketball. I respect the game. I know I can play this game. I know I can play this game at the highest level. I knew that. So I went down there and I grinded. I was isolated and it made me grow up.\"\nWith a 3.5 GPA in hand, a focused Nicks returned to Indiana State, averaging 19.3 ppg, earning the nickname \"Mr. Intensity.\" Nicks combined with teammate Larry Bird in 1978-79, and helped lead Indiana State to the championship game in the NCAA tournament, with their only loss coming in the final, with the Magic Johnson led Michigan State Spartans defeating the Sycamores 75-64.\nIn his senior season, Nicks averaged 26.8 ppg, earning honorable mention All-American. Nicks was twice named to the All-Missouri Valley Conference first team (1979, 1980). He was also named to the USA Select Team in 1979 for a tour of the People's Republic of China.\nProfessional career.\nAfter being selected by the Denver Nuggets with the 23rd overall pick in the 1980 NBA draft, Nicks played for Denver, averaging 6.1 ppg in 27 games before being traded to the Utah Jazz in December 1980. He would finish the season with the Jazz, averaging 6.3 ppg. He would spend the 1981-82 season in Utah, averaging 7.4 ppg in 80 games played. He was released by the Jazz at the end of the season, but signed as a free agent by the Cleveland Cavaliers, playing 9 games for the Cavs in their 1982-83 season before his release, bringing his NBA career to a close. In 156 career NBA games, Nicks averaged 16 minutes, 6.8 points, 1.9 rebounds and 1.6 assists.\nHe spent played for the Toronto Tornados of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) during the 1983–84 season, averaging 24.3 ppg. Nicks then spent five seasons in Europe, playing initially for Saint-Étienne in France, and then for two years B.C. Oostende in the Belgian BNXT League (1985-1987). Nick then went back to France, playing for Tours Métropole Basket from 1987-1989 before retiring.\nPersonal life.\nAfter retiring as a player, Nicks coached alongside Bill Hodges, his former head coach at Indiana State, at Mercer University before moving to Indianapolis in 1998. He was a coach in the Pike Township system and ran a program for at-risk teenagers for Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital before rejoining former Sycamore teammate and then Indiana Pacers president Larry Bird with the Pacers as a scout.\nIn 2007, Nicks was inducted into the Indiana State Athletics Hall of Fame and his #22 Sycamores jersey was retired in 2018. He reflected on his experiences at Indiana State, stating, \"It all worked out for me. If someone had asked me back then if I would ever think about a jersey retirement, I would ask them if they were crazy. But moving forward, it happened ... and I'm just real grateful about it.\""

        "text": "Bruce Lawrence Taylor (born May 28, 1948) is an American former professional football player who was spent his entire eight-year career as a cornerback for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League (NFL) from 1970 to 1977. He played college football for the Boston University Terriers and was selected by the 49ers in the first round of the 1970 NFL Draft. With San Francisco, Taylor played in the NFC Championship Game in 1971 and 1972. He was also named to the Pro Bowl in 1972. During his football career, Taylor received several rookie of the year awards including ones from \"Pro Football Weekly\" and the \"Associated Press\".\nIn 1978, Taylor was cut from the 49ers and briefly played for the Montreal Alouettes in the Canadian Football League (CFL). With the Alouettes, Taylor played in the Eastern Football Conference and Grey Cup championships held in 1978. Following his cut from the Oakland Raiders in 1979, Taylor worked in finance before becoming a Burger King owner in 1982. After expanding his Burger King locations to 18 stores by the late 1990s, Taylor returned to sports as a volunteer coach for a Florida high school in 2009. Taylor was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1997.\nEarly life and education.\nOn May 28, 1948, Taylor was born in Perth Amboy, New Jersey. Growing up, Taylor played baseball and basketball while in high school. After high school, Taylor was picked by the Baltimore Orioles in the 30th round of the 1966 Major League Baseball draft. He declined the offer by the Orioles to attend Boston University. \nDuring his time at Boston, he played at the 1968 NCAA University Division baseball tournament on the Boston University Terriers team. As a football player, Taylor appeared at the Pasadena Bowl and East–West Shrine Bowl in 1969. He also worked as a schoolteacher and factory worker while attending university. In 1970, Taylor played in the Chicago College All-Star Game. He was the All Stars' Most Valuable Player at the game.\nCareer.\nIn 1970, Taylor turned down an offer to play in the Canadian Football League with the Montreal Alouettes. During the first round of the 1970 NFL Draft, Taylor was picked by the San Francisco 49ers. With the 49ers, Taylor appeared at the NFC Championship Game in 1971 and 1972. As part of the National Football Conference, Taylor played at the 1972 Pro Bowl. \nTaylor continued to play with the 49ers until he injured his hamstring in July 1978. After sitting out the 49ers training camp due to injury, Taylor was cut from the team in August 1978. During his eight seasons with the 49ers, Taylor was the 1970 punt returns season leader with 516 yards. Overall, Taylor had 1323 punt return yards and 190 kick return yards during his 109 games in the NFL. He also accumulated 201 yards with his 18 interceptions. \nDuring his football career, Taylor was employed by Dean Witter Reynolds and began his stockbroking experience. Taylor was a stockbroker upon leaving the 49ers before he joined the Montreal Alouettes in late 1978. As a substitute for injured Dickie Harris, Taylor and the Alouettes defeated the Ottawa Rough Riders at the 1978 Eastern Football Conference championship. While continuing to play as Harris's replacement, Taylor and the Alouettes lost to the Edmonton Eskimos at the 1978 Grey Cup. In May 1979, Taylor returned to the United States and joined a training camp for the Oakland Raiders. He remained with the Raiders for a few months before being cut in August 1979.\nIn 1979, Taylor stopped playing football and worked in finance for three years. After switching to fast food in 1982, Taylor owned Burger King locations in Seattle and Woodinville, Washington by the early 1990s. By the late 1990s, Taylor had opened Burger King stores in Chicago and owned eighteen locations. Taylor returned to sports in 2009 when he became a high school volunteer coach in Florida.\nHonors and personal life.\nIn 1969, Taylor was named the best senior player in New England by the New England Football Writers Association. That year, the Gridiron Club of Boston chose Taylor as the best football player in New England. Taylor and Marty Liquori were each chosen by The New Jersey Sports Writers Association as \"New Jersey's outstanding college athlete\" in 1970. As a defensive player, Taylor won the 1970 rookie of the year awards from \"Pro Football Weekly\" and the \"Associated Press\". \nWhile a member of the National Football Conference, Taylor received rookie of the year awards for 1970 from the \"United Press International\" and \"Sporting News\". For hall of fames, Taylor was named into Boston University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1970 and became part of the College Football Hall of Fame in 1997. Taylor is married and has two children.

In 1981, they created the second urethane ball in the market, and Hammer was born. Hammer was the first to put a logo on the side of the ball. After a PBA player was featured in a tournament telecast using the ball with its visible claw hammer logo, sales exploded. The Hammer brand was also the first to produce a urethane two-piece ball. In 1996, Faball Enterprises licensed the Hammer product name to Faball USA. This company maintained the brand name until Hammer products were acquired by Ebonite International on February 8, 2002. \nAfter the sale of its Hammer line to Ebonite, the Faball team went on to create a new line of equipment under the name of Visionary Bowling Products. They currently produce several lines of equipment including the popular Ogre series, the New Breed series and Gladiator series. Visionary Bowling Products are manufactured in St. Louis, MO. \nSome of the more famous Faball era Hammer products are the Blue Hammer, Red Hammer, Burgundy Hammer, Black Hammer, The Nail and the Reaper series. Some of the more famous post-Faball era Hammer lines include the Blade series, Vicious series, Diesel series, Hawg series, No Mercy Series, Vibe series, Black Widow Series, Jigsaw series, the Raw Hammer, Hammer Hardcore and Taboo series. Hammer sponsors several PBA Tour players, including PBA champions Bill O'Neill, Tom Daugherty, Marshall Kent, Shawn Maldonado and Mike Wolfe, as well as PWBA champion and Team USA member Shannon Pluhowsky.\nHammer products were manufactured in Ebonite's Hopkinsville, Kentucky plant from 2002 through November, 2019. On November 15, 2019, Ebonite International and all of its brands were subsequently purchased by Brunswick Bowling Products, LLC."

The team is controlled by the Czech Basketball Federation (ČBF).\nThe Czech Republic and Slovakia are the joint-successors to the Czechoslovakia national team after the Czech Republic and Slovakia split from Czechoslovakia, due to the dissolution of the unified state in 1993. The Czech Republic national team made their debut in international competition in a qualifier for the EuroBasket in 1993. The team has qualified for the tournament six times overall. The Czech Republic has also qualified for the FIBA World Cup, where the team reached the quarter-finals in their first appearance in 2019.\nHistory.\n1990s.\nIn 1993, the Czech Republic national team was officially founded after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. The team played their first international match on 30 May 1993 against Slovenia.\nAfter several failed attempts at qualifying in 1993, 1995, and 1997 the Czech Republic finally clinched qualification to the EuroBasket finals tournament for the first time after independence at EuroBasket 1999. The national team got off to a quick start, as they won their first two preliminary round matches against Lithuania and Greece, before losing to Germany in their final game of group play. With a record of (2–1), the Czech Republic booked their place into the second group phase. There, the team was thoroughly dominated against Croatia and Italy, before losing a close battle against Turkey 73–78 to exit the tournament. In all, the Czech Republic finished their maiden voyage to the EuroBasket in 12th place. While national team standout Luboš Bartoň took the honor of being the second best scorer of the tournament averaging (18.7 points per game).\n2000s.\nThroughout the 2000s for the Czech Republic, the national team suffered numerous setbacks. Failed attempts to qualify for the EuroBasket on multiple occasions were demoralizing reminders that the team had to become stronger in order to compete with the best on the continental stage. However, during qualification for EuroBasket 2007, led by national team veterans Jiří Welsch, Luboš Bartoň and Petr Benda, the Czech Republic would qualify for their second overall appearance at the competition. In their first game at the 2007 tournament, the national team would lose in a classic against the Dirk Nowitzki led Germany squad in overtime 78–83. The tough loss for the team carried over into their next match, where they would suffer a heavy defeat at the hands of Lithuania 95–75. With one game left in group play, and still an opportunity to advance the Czechs would come up short again, this time to Turkey 72–80 to be eliminated.\n2010s.\nAfter missing out on the EuroBasket in 2011, the Czech Republic turned the page to qualify for EuroBasket 2013. Their first game of the tournament was against hosts Slovenia. However, the team would succumb in a narrowly contested game between the two sides 60–62. Although the Czechs would show resilience in their second match against Poland, behind a dominant game from big man Jan Veselý and his (23 points and 14 rebounds) to win 68–69. After the strong win for the Czech Republic, their third game of the tournament was a total calamity for the team, as they were completely mauled by the eventual champions Spain 60–39. The humbling loss for the team however, fueled them to a win in their next game against Georgia 95–79. Heading into their final match of group play, with the possibility of advancing all but gone the Czechs would fall to Croatia 70–53.\nThe Czech Republic entered the EuroBasket 2015, after going (4–2) during qualifying to make their fourth EuroBasket appearance. To begin their 2015 tournament run, the Czech Republic was placed into Group D. The team would easily win their first two matches of the event, before their date versus co-hosts Latvia. However, strong games from team captain Tomáš Satoranský (22 points and 9 assists), and center Jan Veselý (17 points and 11 rebounds) wouldn't be enough as Latvia would prevail 65–72. After the loss, the Czechs would regroup to split their final two games of the group phase to advance to the Round of 16. There, the team displayed supreme focus to defeat Croatia 59–80, to send the team into the quarter-finals of the EuroBasket for the first time. With a chance to reach the semi-finals on the line, the Czechs would fall short against Serbia 89–75. After the tough loss, the team would play two more games in the Olympic bracket qualifier to finish the tournament.\nIn qualification for the 2016 Olympic tournament, the Czech Republic failed to qualify after going (1–2) and being eliminated, losing to Serbia once again.\nAt EuroBasket 2017, the Czech Republic was drawn into Group C for their stint at the tournament. Although the team was quickly eliminated, failing to make it out of the group stage after posting a disappointing (1–4) record.\nDuring European Qualifiers for the 2019 FIBA World Cup, the Czech Republic amassed an (8–4) record during qualifying to solidify their first ever trip to the World Cup finals. Heading toward the 2019 FIBA World Cup, the Czech Republic was slotted into Group E to begin the tournament. The first game for the team, however, would turn out to be a loss against the heavily favoured United States 67–88. Going into their second match of the tournament, the Czechs picked up their first ever World Cup finals victory over Japan. With one game to go, and a path to advance into the second group phase, the team would pullout a solid 76–91 win over Turkey.\nEntering the second group phase, the Czech Republic continued their impressive play as the team picked up a huge victory, this time against Brazil 71–93. Although in their final match of group play, the Czechs suffered an 77–84 defeat to Greece. Even after the tough loss, the team would get the help it needed to advance into the quarter-finals, due to the United States eliminating Brazil.\nIn the quarter-finals, unfortunately, the tournament run for the Czechs would come to an end. The team would be eliminated 82–70 by Australia. With classification matches to determine the final positions, the team would split their two games to be awarded sixth place.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the EuroBasket 2025 Qualifiers matches on 23 and 26 February 2024 against Greece and Great Britain.\nPast rosters.\n1999 EuroBasket: finished 12th among 16 teams\n4 Petr Czudek, 5 Petr Welsch, 6 Vladan Vahala, 7 Marek Stuchlý, 8 Jiří Welsch, 9 David Klapetek, 10 Jiří Okáč, 11 Luboš Bartoň,&lt;br&gt;12 Petr Treml, 13 Martin Ides, 14 Kamil Novák, 15 Pavel Bečka (Coach: Zdeněk Hummel)\n2007 EuroBasket: finished 15th among 16 teams\n4 Štěpán Vrubl, 5 Pavel Beneš, 6 Maurice Whitfield, 7 Michal Křemen, 8 Lukáš Kraus, 9 Jiří Welsch, 10 Ladislav Sokolovský,&lt;br&gt;11 Luboš Bartoň, 12 Radek Nečas, 13 Petr Benda, 14 Jakub Houška, 15 Ondřej Starosta (Coach: Zdeněk Hummel)\n2013 EuroBasket: finished 14th among 24 teams\n4 Petr Benda, 5 Ondřej Balvín 6 Pavel Pumprla, 7 Vojtěch Hruban, 8 Tomáš Satoranský, 9 Jiří Welsch, 10 Pavel Houška,&lt;br&gt;11 Luboš Bartoň, 12 David Jelínek, 13 Jakub Kudláček, 14 Kamil Švrdlík, 15 Jan Veselý (Coach: Pavel Budínský)\n2015 EuroBasket: finished 7th among 24 teams\n4 Petr Benda, 5 Patrik Auda, 6 Pavel Pumprla, 7 Vojtěch Hruban, 8 Tomáš Satoranský (C), 9 Jiří Welsch, 10 Pavel Houška,&lt;br&gt;11 Luboš Bartoň, 12 David Jelínek, 13 Jakub Šiřina, 14 Blake Schilb, 24 Jan Veselý (Coach: Ronen Ginzburg)\n2017 EuroBasket: finished 20th among 24 teams\n1 Patrik Auda, 7 Vojtěch Hruban, 8 Tomáš Satoranský (C), 9 Jiří Welsch, 11 Lukáš Palyza, 13 Jakub Šiřina, 14 Kamil Švrdlík,&lt;br&gt;15 Martin Peterka, 17 Jaromir Bohačík, 23 Adam Pecháček, 31 Martin Kříž, 71 Tomáš Kyzlink (Coach: Ronen Ginzburg)\n2019 FIBA World Cup: finished 6th among 32 teams\n1 Patrik Auda, 4 Tomáš Vyoral, 6 Pavel Pumprla, 7 Vojtěch Hruban, 8 Tomáš Satoranský (C), 11 Blake Schilb, 12 Ondřej Balvín,&lt;br&gt;13 Jakub Šiřina, 15 Martin Peterka, 17 Jaromír Bohačík, 23 Lukáš Palyza, 31 Martin Kříž (Coach: Ronen Ginzburg)\n2020 Olympic Games: finished 9th among 12 teams\n1 Patrik Auda, 4 Tomáš Vyoral, 8 Tomáš Satoranský (C), 11 Blake Schilb, 12 Ondřej Balvín, 13 Jakub Šiřina, 15 Martin Peterka,&lt;br&gt;17 Jaromír Bohačík, 19 Ondřej Sehnal, 23 Lukáš Palyza, 24 Jan Veselý, 25 David Jelínek (Coach: Ronen Ginzburg)\n2022 EuroBasket: finished 16th among 24 teams\n1 Patrik Auda, 7 Vojtěch Hruban (C), 8 Tomáš Satoranský, 12 Ondřej Balvín, 15 Martin Peterka, 17 Jaromír Bohačík, 19 Ondřej Sehnal,&lt;br&gt;24 Jan Veselý, 25 David Jelínek, 27 Vít Krejčí, 31 Martin Kříž, 77 Tomáš Kyzlink (Coach: Ronen Ginzburg)"

The series ended on May 9, 1949, as a result of budgetary problems at the sponsoring Gillette Company.\nDuMont.\nThe DuMont version was hosted by Chris Schenkel; Schenkel took over for Dennis James, who had hosted most of DuMont's boxing telecasts prior to 1954.\nThis regularly scheduled program, which aired boxing matches from St. Nicholas Arena in New York City on Monday nights, is notable for being the final program to air on DuMont. The last network-aired program was broadcast on August 6, 1956, though a few remaining programs were seen locally on New York's WABD afterward.\nWith limited finances, DuMont aired many sports programs throughout its history. Boxing, wrestling, basketball, and football were always network mainstays, even during prime time, as they were cheaper than most scripted programs (this in an era before sports rights fees accelerated to their modern levels) and filled large programming blocks that would otherwise have gone unfilled. Most of DuMont's regular series were cancelled on April 1, 1955, and the last non-sports program, the panel show \"What's the Story\", left the airwaves on September 23, 1955, leaving only a few cheaply produced sports programs on the schedule.\nHowever, by August 1956, even DuMont's sports programs, including \"Boxing From St. Nicholas Arena\", were axed.\nEpisode status.\nAbout 60 episodes of the DuMont version, including the final program on August 6, 1956, survive at the UCLA Film and Television Archive. However, some of these episodes are from the non-network version which continued to run on WABD after the network closed (these are also notable due to the rarity of kinescopes of local programming aired on United States television stations during the 1950s)."

However, Andriy Deryzemlya of Ukraine, who had not placed on a World Cup podium for two seasons, was ranked 34th in the overall World Cup, and who had not placed in the top six of sprint races for the last four seasons, used two perfect shootings to beat World Cup number three Björn Ferry by ten seconds. \nNeither Russia nor Germany managed to get anyone in the top ten; the best German was Alexander Wolf in 15th with three misses, with Birnbacher, World Cup leader Greis, and Michael Rösch also missing more than two times.

        "title": "Scoring system development of badminton",
        "text": "Various scoring systems in badminton were developed during the sport's history. Since 2006, international competition uses the 3 x 21 rally point system as endorsed by the Badminton World Federation.\nOriginal system.\nThe original scoring system in badminton dates back to as early as 1873. A match or rubber is decided by the best of three games. Each game is played to 15 points in the case of men's singles and any doubles games. In the case of ladies' singles, a game is played to 11 points.\nThe traditional scoring system also allows for a single game to determine a match or rubber. In this instance the game would be played to 21 points.\nThe first service is usually determined by the equivalent of a coin toss. Usually, the shuttle is dropped on top of the net; the server is appointed by the direction it points to when it falls to the floor. Thereafter a rally has to be won for service to change or a point to be won.\nIn singles, if the server loses a rally, the service would be transferred to the opponent. If the server wins a rally, their score is increased by one point. In doubles, if the server loses a rally, the service would transfer to their partner (except if serving first in the game) presenting a second opportunity to maintain scoring (second server). If service is lost again, service is transferred to the opposition. If the server's team wins a rally, their team score is increased by one point.\nIn a game to 15 points, if the score reached 13–13, the player reaching 13 first would have the choice of \"setting\" or playing straight through to 15. If they choose to \"set\", the score reverts to 0–0 and whoever scores five points wins the game. If the score reached 14–14, the player reaching 14 first would again have the option to \"set\" or play straight through to 15. This time however, the winner would be the first to score three points. In a game to 11 points, setting would occur at nine and 10 with \"setting\" to three and two points respectively. In a game to 21 points, setting would take place at 19 and 20 points \"setting\" to five and three respectively.\nIn 2002, the \"setting\" at 13–13, 9–9 and 19–19 was dropped from the rules.\n2002: scoring system of 5 × 7.\nIn 2002 the International Badminton Federation (BWF), concerned with the unpredictable and often lengthy time required for matches, decided to experiment with a different scoring system to improve the commercial and especially the broadcasting appeal of the sport. The new scoring system shortened games to seven points and decided matches by the best of five games. When the score reached 6–6, the player who first reached six could elect to set to eight points.\nThe match time remained an issue, since the playing time for the two scoring systems was similar. This experiment was abandoned and replaced by a modified version of the traditional scoring system. The 2002 Commonwealth Games was the last event that used this scoring system.\n2005–2006: 3 × 21 rally point.\nIn December 2005 the BWF experimented again with the scoring system, intending both to regulate the playing time and to simplify the system for television viewers. The main change from the traditional system was to adopt rally point scoring, in which the winner of a rally scores a point regardless of who served; games were lengthened to 21 points, with ladies' singles matches now using the same rules as men's singles. There must be at least a two-point difference between scores.\nIn the old system, competitors may not be able to score after many exchanges, since serving is often slightly more difficult than defending, especially in professional badminton. Scoring is capped at 30 points, including the golden point rule at 29–29.\nIn August 2006, the International Badminton Federation (now known as the Badminton World Federation (BWF)) adopted this system.\n2014: experimental 5 × 11 rally point system.\nIn the BWF Annual Grand Meeting in 2014 a review of the scoring system was performed. Match lengths had increased since the 2006 scoring system change. Several systems were considered in advance. In the end it was decided to try a system with 5 games to 11 points with no setting (i.e., the game ends no later than 11–10). The system was tried during a period from 1 August – 1 November 2014 in lower-level tournaments."

The only first-class match on the tour is one in March against a South African national team which was retrospectively awarded Test status.

At the time it was known as a South African XI \"versus\" W. W. Read's XI. South Africa won the toss and batted first. They were soon all out for 97, with John Ferris taking 6 for 54. In reply, an innings of 134 from Henry Wood saw Read's side total 369, a lead of 272 that South Africa were never likely to catch.

Wisden 1931 reproduced a letter from the SABC which outlined its case. Wisden has ignored the ruling and includes the match in the career figures of all the players who took part, including record-breaking players such as Wilfred Rhodes, Jack Hobbs and Frank Woolley.\nIt is possible that the SABC thought it was a 2-day match, but Wisden 1911 clearly states that \"not a ball could be bowled on the first and fourth days\" so it was actually planned as a 4-day match.\nFor more information about this curious affair, see: Variations in First-Class Cricket Statistics."

        "text": "The New Zealand national cricket team toured South Africa from October 1953 to February 1954 and played a five match Test series against the South Africa national cricket team. South Africa won the Test series 4–0. The tour was the first by a representative New Zealand side to South Africa and the tourists embarked on their visit without having won a Test match since they had been granted full member status of the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1930.\nSouth Africa were captained by Jack Cheetham and New Zealand by Geoff Rabone.\nTour party.\nThe New Zealand team was captained by Geoff Rabone with Bert Sutcliffe as vice-captain. Rabone had been reluctant to tour but was chosen as captain ahead of Merv Wallace, who had captained New Zealand when South Africa had toured in 1952–53. Despite having retired from Test cricket in 1951, the experienced Walter Hadlee was asked to captain the side but declined and Rabone agreed to lead the tour. Wallace chose not to join the tour after Rabone was appointed. Sutcliffe, who was New Zealand's outstanding post-war batsman, captained the New Zealanders during the fourth and fifth Test matches after Rabone broke a bone in his foot.\nThe average age of the team was 25. With the aim of establishing a high standard of fielding, some older or slower players were overlooked, including the spinners Tom Burtt and Alex Moir, and the opening batsman Gordon Leggat. Leggat later joined the team for the Australian leg of the tour, replacing the injured Rabone.\nThe manager was the former Test batsman Jack Kerr. The four players who had not yet played Test cricket – Beck, Bell, Ian Leggat and Overton – all played their first Tests on the tour.\nTour itinerary.\nThe tour took place between October 1953 and March 1954, with the New Zealanders in South Africa until mid-February. Three first-class matches were played in Australia during March on the return leg of the tour, and the touring team played a match against a New Zealand XI on their return to their home country. The team left New Zealand on the Arawa on 1 October, arriving in Cape Town on 28 October after visiting Port Melbourne and Fremantle in Australia.\nA total of 17 matches were played in South Africa during the tour, 16 of which were first-class. Seven matches were played before the first Test match, including one in Rhodesia. A single match took place between the first and second Tests and three further first-class matches were played between the third and fourth Tests; Rabone was injured during the final first-class match against Border, immediately before the fourth Test was played.\nTest series.\nAll of the Test matches during the tour were four-day matches and used 8-ball overs. South Africa won four of the matches, although the New Zealanders were in strong positions in two of these matches. The third Test was a draw.\nFirst Test.\nThe first Test match of the series was played at Kingsmead Cricket Ground in Durban, beginning on 11 December 1953. South Africa's Neil Adcock and New Zealand's Guy Overton made their Test match debuts during the match.\nSouth Africa gained a \"great advantage\" by winning the toss and chose to bat on a wicket which \"Wisden\" said \"became more difficult as the match progressed\". They scored 437 runs before declaring their innings complete after 115 overs. An opening century-partnership between Jackie McGlew and John Waite provided a foundation for the innings, with Roy McLean and Ken Funston also adding 135 for the fourth wicket, McLean top-scoring with an innings of 101. In reply, New Zealand finished the second day's play on 70 for the loss of 2 wickets (70/2) with captain Geoff Rabone unbeaten on 40 runs.\nAfter a rest day on 13 December, Rabone completed his first century in Test cricket, scoring 107 in an innings which lasted over six hours, but New Zealand were all out for 230, and were asked to follow on. Off spin bowler Hugh Tayfield took six wickets for the cost of 62 runs (6/62) from his 36 overs, and \"Wisden\" reported that both he and leg spinner Clive van Ryneveld, who took three wickets, turned the ball \"sharply\" and \"bowled with sustained accurately\". After losing two quick wickets at the end of the third day's play, they were all out for 149, losing the match by an innings and 58 runs. Rabone, who \"again resisted strongly\", top-scored with 60 in New Zealand's second innings and batted for 9¾ hours of the 11¼ that New Zealand batted for.\nSecond Test.\nThe second test was famous for New Zealand player Bob Blair receiving news that his fiancée, Nerissa Love, had been killed in the Tangiwai railway disaster on Christmas Eve. Blair was not expected to bat when his turn came on Boxing Day, as an announcement had been made that he would take no further part in the game. In the event, however, he appeared at the crease at the fall of the ninth wicket to join Bert Sutcliffe, who had already started to walk off the field. The packed crowd stood in silence. The two men added 33 for the last wicket and avoided a follow on, with Sutcliffe striking three sixes and Blair one from a single eight-ball over, but in the next over Blair was stumped off Hugh Tayfield. South Africa won the match by 132 runs."

The tour was organised by the Marylebone Cricket Club and the side played five Test matches as \"England\" and 15 other first-class matches as \"MCC\". Two of the first-class matches took place in Rhodesia in what is now Zimbabwe.\nEngland won the first two Test matches; the third was drawn; and South Africa won the final two games. The Test series was noted at the time for slow scoring, and England averaged 32.69 runs an hour in the series, while South Africa managed only 29.04.\nEngland team.\nThe MCC team was captained by Peter May, with Doug Insole as vice-captain. The former England Test captain Freddie Brown was the tour manager.\nThe full team was: \nAll of the players except Taylor had played in Test cricket before the tour. Oakman, Parks and Taylor did not play in any of Tests on the tour, and Taylor never appeared in Test cricket. Parks was injured soon after the tour began and flew back to the UK for treatment; he did not rejoin the tour and no replacement was sent for. The manager, Brown, appeared in one first-class match.\nTest series summary.\nFirst Test.\nThe match was noted for slow scoring, with Peter Richardson's 117 in England's first innings being at the time the slowest Test match century, taking eight hours and eight minutes to reach the 100. Richardson's 121-run fourth-wicket partnership with Colin Cowdrey was the highest of the match, Cowdrey making 59. No South African batsman reached 50, and Statham, Wardle and Bailey each took three wickets. England's second innings was also a struggle on a difficult pitch and South Africa were set 204 to win. With Tyson ill, Bailey opened the bowling with Statham and took five for 20 as South Africa were out for their lowest score in a home Test since 1898–99.\nSecond Test.\nOn a slow pitch, England's opening pair of Richardson (45) and Bailey (34) started with 76, and then Compton made 58. But the major contribution to a big total was a sixth-wicket partnership of 93 between Cowdrey, who made 101 and Evans (62). As in the first Test, no South African batsman made 50. Wardle took five wickets for 53. Injuries to Neil Adcock and Clive van Ryneveld restricted South Africa to defensive bowling and fielding, but Compton (64) and Cowdrey (61) scored fast enough to allow May to declare, setting South Africa 385 to win in eight hours. They had little answer to Wardle, who took seven for 36 to finish with match figures of 12 for 89. In the South African second innings, Russell Endean was out handled the ball when he touched a ball that had flown upwards from his bat and threatened to fall on his stumps. It was the first time any batsman had been out in this manner in Test cricket.\nThird Test.\nRichardson (68) and Bailey (80) opened with a stand of 115, during which they scored 103 runs in two hours before lunch on the first day. Thereafter, England surrendered the initiative, and Tayfield bowled 14 consecutive maidens, nine of them to Bailey. For South Africa, Tony Pithey, in his first Test, put on 65 with Trevor Goddard, who made 69, and then Roy McLean hit South Africa's only century of the series. The two first innings took until the tea interval on the third day. England were in trouble at 79 for three in the second innings with Bailey also injured, but Insole made 110 in six hours and 10 minutes and was not out when the innings ended. Hugh Tayfield's eight wickets for 69 runs in England's second innings was the best return by a South African bowler ever, beating the eight for 70 by Tip Snooke in 1905–06. Set 190 to win in four hours and 10 minutes, South Africa were unable to score quickly enough against accurate bowling and the match ended in a draw.\nFourth Test.\nTayfield's record for the best bowling return by a South African in a Test match, set in the Third Test, lasted only three weeks. In England's second innings, he took nine for 113 with the final wicket a catch by his brother, Arthur, who was fielding as a substitute. South Africa had started well, with a second wicket stand of 112 between Goddard (67) and John Waite (61) before McLean made 93. May made his best score of the series, 61, and Insole and Compton passed 40, but South Africa led by 89. Goddard made 49 as South Africa lost cheap wickets, and England were set 232 to win with three-quarter of an hour plus a whole day to get them. Richardson (39), Insole (68) and Cowdrey (55) gave them hope, and at tea on the final day, England needed just 46 with four wickets remaining. But Tayfield, who bowled throughout the final day, took the lot with 17 runs to spare.\nFifth Test.\nThis is the slowest Test in history, with scoring at a rate of 1.40 runs per six balls. A newly-laid pitch made batting difficult throughout, with unpredictable bounce and many balls that kept low. Endean made 70 in South Africa's first innings and that was by some distance the highest score of the match. Bailey made an uncharacteristically pugnacious 41, but only two other England batsmen reached doubled figures in the first innings. Tyson then took six for 40 in South Africa's second innings, but with runs difficult to obtain against the faster bowlers, Tayfield's off-spinners profited in England's second innings and his six for 78 gave him 37 wickets in the series, a record for a South African player. The match was Denis Compton's last Test."

        "text": "The New Zealand national cricket team toured South Africa from October 1961 to February 1962 and played a five-match Test series against the South Africa national cricket team. The series was drawn 2–2, with New Zealand's victory in the third Test the team's first Test match win outside their home country. New Zealand captain John Reid scored a total of 1,915 runs during the tour, setting a record for the most runs scored in South Africa by a touring batsman. The tour was the second to South Africa by a team from New Zealand, the previous tour having taken place in 1953–54.\nAfter South Africa withdrew from the British Commonwealth in 1961, the tour was not deemed official as the country was no longer a member of the Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC). Despite this, the international matches on the tour have always been considered to have Test match status.\nDue to the sporting boycott of South Africa during the apartheid era, no official Test cricket was played by South Africa after 1970, with an effective moratorium on international tours to the country after a resolution passed by the ICC opposing the apartheid system. As a result, New Zealand did not tour the country again until 1994–95, after the end of the apartheid regime and the reintegration of South Africa into international sport in 1991.\nTour party.\nThe New Zealand side was captained by John Reid with Murray Chapple as the vice-captain. Reid was by far the most experienced member of the side with 34 Test caps; other than Noel McGregor with 15, no other member of the side had more than 10 caps to their name and eight players on the tour had not made their Test debut. Six of these went on to play in the Test matches on the tour, with only John Ward and Bryan Yuile not playing in any of the Tests.\nNew Zealand's outstanding post-war batsman, Bert Sutcliffe, had retired from Test cricket and was not available for the tour, although he came back into the side for the 1965 tour of India, Pakistan and England at the age of 41. Experienced players Bob Blair and Alex Moir were not selected for the tour.\nThe manager of the team was Gordon Leggat, who played in one of the non-first-class matches on the tour.\nA protest against the South African apartheid regime took place during the squad selection meeting in Christchurch. The team was the last from New Zealand to visit apartheid-era South Africa; the next New Zealand team to tour the country did so in 1994/95, after the end of the sporting boycott of South Africa.\nTour itinerary.\nThe tour took place between October 1961 and March 1962. The New Zealanders travelled to and from South Africa via Australia. They played a first-class match against Western Australia on the outward leg of their journey and matches against South Australia and New South Wales on the return journey, the only matches played in March.\nA total of 21 matches were played in South Africa during the tour, including the five Test matches, as well as three played in Rhodesia. Eleven matches, seven of which were first-class, were played during the period between October and December, before the first Test match. These included three matches, two of which were first-class, in Rhodesia. Another eight matches, six of which were first-class, were played between the Test matches, including five in January 1962 between the third and fourth Tests.\nTest series.\nAll of the Test matches during the tour were four-day matches. Each side won two of the five matches with one drawn Test, leaving the series drawn.\nFirst Test.\nThe first Test match of the tour was held at Kingsmead Cricket Ground in Durban, beginning on 8 December 1961. Seven of the South African team and five New Zealanders made their Test debuts in the match. The South African team was captained by Jackie McGlew in his final series.\nSouth Africa won the toss and chose to bat, scoring 292 runs in their first innings, and innings anchored by McGlew who carried his bat with a score of 127. Only Roy McLean, who scored 63, made a score of more than 25 runs and \"Wisden\" commented that the batting of the new South African players, other than Colin Bland, was \"disappointing\" throughout the match. In reply New Zealand scored 245 runs, with Paul Barton and Zin Harris both making half-centuries, leaving South Africa with a lead of 47 runs after the first innings.\nAfter a rest day on Sunday 10 December, South Africa resumed their second innings. When Bland was fourth man out with the score on 110 they appeared well placed to build a big lead, but collapsed in less than an hour to be all out for 149, leaving New Zealand to score 197 runs with more than a days play remaining. They failed to reach their target and were all out for 166 after what \"Wisden\" called \"rank bad batting\", with South Africa winning the match by just 30 runs. Peter Pollock, on his Test debut aged 20, took a five-wicket haul with six wickets for a cost of 38 runs in the innings and nine wickets in the match.\nSecond Test.\nThe second Test match began on Boxing Day at Wanderers in Johannesburg. McGlew again won the toss and chose to bat, John Waite scoring a century in South Africa's first innings score of 322 runs. Frank Cameron took five wickets in the innings. Rain had restricted play to only 80 minutes on the first day, and New Zealand did not begin their reply until the final session of the second day. They scored 223 in their innings, with Godfrey Lawrence taking eight wickets for 53 runs, the best bowling figures in Test matches by a South African fast bowler. Debutant Graham Dowling top scored for New Zealand with 74.\nMcGlew declared South Africa's second innings at 178/6, leaving New Zealand with a target of 278 runs in around four hours play. They reached 165 runs for the loss of four wickets and the match was drawn, with \"Wisden\" lamenting the loss of time to rain on the first day. Dowling scored a second half century, with John Reid top scoring with 75 not out.\nThird Test.\nThe third Test was played at Newlands in Cape Town, beginning on New Year's Day. Reid won the toss for the first time in the series and New Zealand chose to bat, scoring 385 runs in their first innings, attacking the South African bowling after losing early wickets. Reid scored a \"pulsating\" 92 runs before Murray Chapple and Zin Harris put on 148 runs for the fifth wicket, Harris scoring his maiden Test century before being stumped for 101. Sydney Burke, making his debut for South Africa, took six wickets, including four cheap ones on the second morning of the match. Buster Farrer also made his debut for South Africa in the match.\nIn reply South Africa were bowled out for 190 runs, Cameron taking a five-wicket haul. Reid did not enforce the follow on and New Zealand scored 212 runs before declaring with nine wickets down, Burke taking another five wickets for 11 on debut.\nSouth Africa required 407 runs to win the match. McGlew, who suffered a hand injury, made 63 runs and McLean a century in under three hours, but the South Africans were bowled out for 335, New Zealand winning by 72 runs. The victory, which \"Wisden\" described as a \"thriller\", was their second in Test matches and their first away from home.\nFourth Test.\nThe fourth Test was played at the beginning of February, with Wanderers being used again to host the match. Burke was dropped, despite his bowling display in the previous Test, and Peter Heine returned to the South African team after an absence of three years. It was to be his last Test match. Tiger Lance made his Test debut for the South Africans, the side's tenth new cap of the series.\nReid won the toss again and opted to bat, but New Zealand were dismissed for 164 runs in their first innings, with Godfrey Lawrence taking another five-wicket haul at Wanderers. Only Reid, who played a \"glorious innings\" for 60, scored more than 22 runs. South Africa replied with a score of 464, with an opening partnership of 134 and another century from McGlew, the seventh and last of his Test match career. Facing a deficit of over 300, New Zealand lost both opening batsmen for ducks and were all out for 249. Reid again dominated the innings, scoring 142, but his side lost by an innings and 51 runs with a full day to play. The match saw South African wicket-keeper John Waite take his 24th dismissal of the series, breaking the world record for dismissals in a five-match series by a wicket-keeper with a match remaining.\nFifth Test.\nThe final Test match of the series was played at St George's Oval in Port Elizabeth, beginning on 16 February. Reid won the toss for the third match in a row and chose to bat on what \"Wisden\" described as a \"batsman's wicket\".\nThe New Zealanders scored 275 runs, with Paul Barton top-scoring with 109, scoring his only Test century in an innings \"Wisden\" described as \"composed, correct and polished\". In reply South Africa scored 190, with opening batsman McGlew, playing in his final Test, suffering from an injured shoulder and not batting until ninth in the batting order as a result.

Mario Lemieux, \"The Magnificent One\", was the closest to breaking several of Gretzky's records, but he was never called \"The Next One\" by the media, because he was Gretzky's contemporary for most of his NHL career.

        "text": "Aaron Jamal Brooks (born January 14, 1985) is an American professional basketball coach and former player. He was selected 26th overall in the 2007 NBA draft. Brooks won the NBA Most Improved Player Award for the 2009–10 season.\nHigh school career.\nBrooks, a high-profile recruit out of Franklin High School in Seattle, \"earned just about every honor possible\" while leading his team to the Washington 4A State Championship as a senior. As a high school senior he averaged 24.3 points, 7.0 assists, 3.3 rebounds and 2.3 steals per game. In that championship game, Brooks went head-to-head with future Gonzaga Bulldog and two-time NBA champion Adam Morrison. Brooks finished with 38 points in the 67–55 win. Morrison finished with 37 in the loss, but was still named Tournament MVP after matching the then four-game scoring title.\nConsidered a four-star recruit by 247Sports.com, Brooks was listed as the No. 4 point guard and the No. 30 player in the nation in 2003.\nCollege career.\nBrooks played his college career at the University of Oregon in 2007. He was a four-year starter for the Ducks, and finished his career with 13.1 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game. In his first year at Oregon, Brooks took over the starting point guard role previously occupied by guard Luke Ridnour, who went on to play in the NBA. Despite missing 10 games with a broken bone in his wrist, Brooks earned Pac-10 All-Freshman honors. Brooks was named honorable mention all-Pac-10 for his efforts as a sophomore, a season which included a 34-point effort against USC. After a disappointing junior year at Oregon culminating in a suspension during a game against Washington, Brooks rebounded to become one of the leading candidates for Pac-10 Player of the Year. He led the Ducks to a number of key victories, including game winners over then #1 ranked UCLA and then #10 Arizona in Tucson. Brooks scored a team high 31 points and grabbed 8 rebounds in an overtime road win against then top 25 ranked Washington State, helping to hand the Cougars their first home loss of the 2006–07 season. At the half-way mark of Pac-10 conference play, Brooks was averaging 19.1 points and 4.5 assists per game in leading Oregon to a top 10 ranking and a 19–2 overall record. The Ducks went on to finish and tie for third place in the Pac-10 conference, and won the Pac-10 Championship tournament following an impressive three-day run over Arizona, Cal and USC. Oregon advanced to the Midwest Regional Final where they lost to defending champion Florida. Brooks was announced as one of 22 finalists for the John R. Wooden Award, which is given to the top college basketball player in the nation. Brooks was one of 10 players named to the Wooden All-American Team, and he was also All-Pac-10 First Team. He won the men's three point shootout on March 29, 2007, to finish off his NCAA career, but lost the \"battle of the sexes\" to Katie Gearlds of Purdue University. He graduated from Oregon in 2007 with a degree in political science.\nProfessional career.\nHouston Rockets (2007–2011).\nOn June 28, 2007, Brooks was taken 26th overall in the first round of the 2007 NBA draft by the Houston Rockets. During the 2007–08 season, he spent time with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers of the NBA Development League.\nOn February 19, 2009, Rafer Alston, the Rockets' starting point guard at the time, was traded to the Orlando Magic minutes before the trading deadline, making way for Brooks to become the starter. As a starter, he averaged around 14.0 points and 4.5 assists per game. On April 21, 2009, Brooks scored 11 points in 27 seconds in a first round 107–103 playoff loss to the Portland Trail Blazers, in which Brooks played a huge part in Houston's rally, scoring three 3-pointers and a fast break lay-up. While the Rockets lost that game, they were able to eliminate Portland in six games. Brooks scored a then career-high 34 points in Game 4 of the 2009 Western Conference semi-finals as the Rockets, without Yao Ming, defeated the Los Angeles Lakers to even the series at 2–2. However, the Lakers eventually won the series in 7 games as well as the championship.\nOn January 13, 2010, Brooks scored a new career high of 43 points in a triple overtime win against the Minnesota Timberwolves. On March 15, 2010, Brooks scored the game winning shot against the Denver Nuggets with 2.9 seconds left in the game. On March 17, 2010, Brooks shot 7–7 from behind the three arc against the Memphis Grizzlies, setting a new franchise record. On April 11, 2010, Brooks became only the sixth player in NBA history to make over 200 3-pointers and over 400 assists in a single season.\nOn April 23, 2010, he was named NBA Most Improved Player, averaging 19.6 points, 5.3 assists, and 2.6 rebounds per game.\nOn November 6, 2010, Brooks suffered a sprained ankle. He returned on December 19, 2010, in a 102–93 win over the Sacramento Kings, in which he came off the bench for 15 minutes and recorded 9 points (all 3-pointers). In his first start since return from his injury, on January 10, 2011, he tied his season-high 24 points, in a win over the Boston Celtics.\nPhoenix Suns (2011).\nOn February 24, 2011, Brooks was traded to the Phoenix Suns for Goran Dragić and a first-round pick the team got from the Orlando Magic in an earlier trade.\nGuangdong Southern Tigers (2011–2012).\nDuring the 2011 NBA lockout, Brooks signed to play for the Guangdong Southern Tigers. On January 6, 2012, Brooks scored 40 points while playing 38 minutes off the bench as Guangdong defeated the Tianjin Ronggang 110–97. Brooks was 5 points shy of tying the Guangdong points scored record made by former player Du Feng. On February 16, 2012, Brooks was selected as the replacement starting point guard for the 2012 CBA All-Star game. The original starter, J.R. Smith, decided not to play due to personal reasons. Brooks was also selected to participate for the CBA's Three-Point Shootout competition. In the three-point shootout, Brooks was one point shy from entering the final round of the competition. In the All-Star game, Brooks led all competitors with 9 assists, but his Northern All-Stars team lost to the Southern All-Stars, 122–112. On March 8, the NBA on TNT did a segment on Brooks' time in China with Guangdong. Brooks led the team in assists for each game leading up to the 2012 CBA Finals, where they lost to the Stephon Marbury-led Beijing Ducks.\nSacramento Kings (2012–2013).\nAfter an absence from the NBA during the 2011–12 season, the Suns initially extended a qualifying offer to Brooks for the 2012–13 season, but would later withdraw the offer, thus making Brooks an unrestricted free agent. Three teams that expressed interest in him were the Dallas Mavericks, the Sacramento Kings, and Brooks' former team, the Houston Rockets. In July 2012, Brooks signed with the Sacramento Kings. He was waived by the Kings on March 1, 2013.\nReturn to Houston (2013–2014).\nHe later signed with the Rockets on March 5, 2013.

His primary role will be coaching Knicks players who are on two-way contracts. Brooks is serving under head coach Tom Thibodeau, whom he played for at stints in both Chicago and Minnesota.\nPersonal life.\nBrooks grew up in Seattle, Washington."

        "text": "The Women's Softball World Cup is a fastpitch softball tournament for women's national teams held historically every four years, now every two years, by the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC). The tournament, originally known as the \"ISF Women's World Championship\", was sanctioned by the International Softball Federation (ISF) until that body's 2013 merger with the International Baseball Federation to create the WBSC. The number of teams in the tournament began at five in its inaugural event in 1965, went to a high of 28 for the 1994 edition, and now the WBSC Code legislates that the maximum number of teams that may participate is 16. There are qualifying tournaments that determine which countries will play at the World Cup.\nHistory.\nA women's softball world championship predates the ISF's event. A championship was held in Canada between several American and Canadian teams in 1952 and 1953. Australia had also hosted an international tournament that predated the first Women's World Championship.\nIn 1965, the first ISF Women's World Championship was held in Melbourne, with games being played at Albert Park. Five nations competed at the inaugural championships including the United States, Japan and Australia, which Australia won 1–0 in a final game against the United States. In the game, Australia was held to only two hits while the United States had four. Lorraine Woolley was named the player of the tournament. The inaugural men's championship would occur one year later in Mexico.\nIn 1970, ten countries participated. The Japanese won competition after having twelve consecutive wins and beating the Americans 3–0 in a final game spectated by 30,000 people.\nIn 1974, the Americans knocked out the Australians during the semi-finals, when they beat them by a score of 6–0.\nTaiwan's leadership discussed inviting China to compete at the 1982 competition which was the country was hosting. Ching-khou and Wang Shen supported mainland China's participation in the event and an invitation was issued but the Chinese government elected to not send a team.\nThe 1990 edition was the seventh to be held, with six countries having played hosts to the competition.\nTeams that competed in 1990 included the US, New Zealand, China, Australia, Chinese Taipei, Japan, Canada, Italy, Netherlands, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Philippines, Bahamas, Netherlands Antilles, Mexico, Aruba, Bermuda, Indonesia, Argentina, and Zimbabwe. The United States took home gold, New Zealand silver and China bronze. The Soviet Union had a representative attend the 1990 competition and promise that a Soviet side would be competing at the next championships.\nThe 2006 edition was very important as the Championships were used for Olympic qualifying, with the top four finishers going to the Olympic Games. In 2006, the fourth-place finishers automatically qualified to the Games because China was the Olympic Games based on that. Thus, there was a battle for fifth place between Canada and Italy for Olympic qualifications. In the match for fifth, Canada won 3-0 and earned their fourth consecutive trip to the Olympics.\nTeams that will be competing at the 2012 edition include Australia, Canada and Japan who will play in the same pool. The competition was scheduled to act as a replacement for the Olympics.\nResults.\nAustralia won the competition in 1965. The victory was considered very impressive as they beat the Americans, who invented the game in 1887, to win the championship. Japan won in 1970, while the 1974 and 1978 editions were won by the United States, the American side also won seven championships in a row from 1988 to 2010, with the USA's most recent victory being a 7–0 win over Japan in the finals. Other countries that have won it include Japan in 1970, 2012 and 2014, and New Zealand in 1982.

On first down Joe Klecko sacked Neil Lomax for an 11-yard loss, then on second down Rod Martin sacked him for an 8-yard loss and on third down Mark Gastineau tackled Eric Dickerson for a safety and an AFC 2-0 lead. Later in the game Seattle's Fred Young blocked a partial punt to set the next score as NFL MVP of 1984 Dan Marino threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Marcus Allen as the AFC head to the locker room with a 9-0 lead at Halftime. \nIn the second half especially the third quarter, the NFC mounted the best drive of the game as it went 66 yards on 12 plays and capping it off with a 13-yard touchdown pass from Super Bowl XIX MVP Joe Montana to James Lofton with 8:04 left in period three. Then the NFC went into high gear as they had a 53-yard 9-play drive that culminated with a 1-yard touchdown run by Walter Payton with 35 seconds into the fourth quarter and a 14-9 lead. But then here comes the AFC as a 56-yard pass from Marino to Marcus Allen set a successful 33-yard field goal by the Seattle Seahawks Norm Johnson to cut the NFC lead to 14-12.\nNow the NFC was driving trying to put this exhibition game out of reach, but with 5:15 left in the game and with the NFC at the AFC 15-yard line on third, Marino tried to hand off to 1984 record breaking sensation Eric Dickerson, but the two collided causing a fumble, and Art Still picked it up and ran 83 yards for a touchdown and the AFC took the lead 19-14. In the closing minutes, the AFC lead by the game's MVP Mark Gastineau shut down the NFC the rest of the way and Norm Johnson's 22-yard field goal with 43 seconds left in the game gave the AFC the victory and close the book on the 1984 NFL Season.\nThe game was televised on ABC's Wide World of Sports, and it was also the last telecast of Don Meredith's illustrious broadcasting career."

        "text": "Peter O'Meara was the inaugural CEO of the Western Force rugby union team. He was appointed in March 2005 following the successful bid by RugbyWA for the right to host the fourth Australian franchise. O'Meara had previously been on the boards of the NSWRU and QRU and had moved to Western Australia in his capacity as an executive with the Commonwealth Bank.\nAfter the launch of Western Force and two completed seasons in the Super 14 competition, O'Meara resigned as CEO in January 2008. This followed RugbyWA being fined $150,000 by the Australian Rugby Union for a breach of protocols relating to player contracts. The controversial fuel technology company Firepower Holdings, run by O'Meara's friend Tony Johnston, had provided sponsorship deals which were a major factor in luring high-profile players including Wallaby star Matt Giteau and others to play for the Western Force. Firepower's Australian operations were put into liquidation in early July 2008 in the Federal Court of Australia, leaving Giteau and a number of other sportsmen owed millions of dollars by Firepower.\nHe was succeeded as CEO of the Force by Greg Harris, appointed in March 2008. O'Meara was appointed as CEO of the Catholic Metropolitan Cemeteries Trust in Sydney in 2010.In 2023, O'Meara received the Papal Honour of the Knight of St Gregory the Great."

        "text": "The XXXX Gold Beach Cricket Tri-Nations series was a beach cricket competition created and sponsored by Australian beer brand XXXX. It was launched on 27 September 2006, and the event coincided with the 2006–07 Ashes series being played in Australia with the first series being played in January 2007.\nThe first series involved cricketing legends from Australia, England and West Indies. It was won by England, who beat Australia in the Grand Final on 4 February 2007. Due to the popularity to the initial series, a new 2008 series was held with teams from Australia, England and New Zealand competing, which also saw the addition of Glenelg Beach in Adelaide included in the schedule alongside the existing locations of Maroubra Beach in Sydney, Scarborough Beach in Perth and Coolangatta Beach in Gold Coast.\n2009 saw the series reduced to just one location, Coolangatta Beach. The series did not return in 2010.\nRules.\nThe series incorporated rules that are a hybrid of outdoor cricket and that of indoor cricket. As with the regular game boundaries score 6 runs if hit over the perimeter, and 4 if the ball hits the ground before passing or touching the perimeter.\nThere are eight overs in an innings, with the final two overs declared \"Captain's Choice\" in which each side's captain is allowed to field the batsmen and bowlers of their own choosing. For the first six overs batsmen and bowlers are swapped out every two overs.\nWhen a batsman is dismissed, he keeps batting – however, he loses runs. A score is decreased by 5 runs when the batsman has been dismissed by two-handed catch, and by 7 runs with a one-handed catch. It is possible to score into negative numbers.\nA batsman cannot be dismissed LBW if he plays a shot.\nThe series uses a plastic drop-in pitch to allow the ball to bounce, and batting and bowling only take place facing one direction. The Coolangatta arena initially featured an open boundary along the surf, allowing fielding to be possible in the water; however this was later removed due to crowd control concerns.\nCompetition results.\n2007 series.\nFinals played in Maroubra, New South Wales, on Sunday, 4 February 2007:\n2008 series.\nLeader board\nFinals played in Coolangatta, Queensland, on Sunday, 20 January 2008:\nRecords.\n\"Minimum of 8 overs\".\nTeam\nIndividual\nTrophies.\nWinners of the round robin competition receive a beer glass, while the runners-up receive a can of XXXX Gold beer. Winners of the finals are presented with a beer glass mounted on a wooden stand. In 2009 the trophies were:\nPromotions &amp; Marketing.\nFor the 2008 series, XXXX was giving away free XXXX Gold Beach Cricket Aussie Team Shirts as part of sales of promotional cartons of XXXX GOLD. Television commercials were aired starring some of the Beach Cricket legends. \nNetwork Ten is the host broadcaster of the matches.\nEntertainment.\nThroughout the matches the players are miked up so both fans at the game and at home watching the televised match can hear the players talking. Also music is played throughout the day whilst the matches were being played.\nWhen the players were fielding around the boundary, they take time out to sign autographs for fans situated around the boundary.\nIn between the matches there are performances on field, by the female cheerleading squad XXXX Angels. Also XXXX promotional staff hand out giveaways including XXXX Gold bucket hats, beach cricket balls and other promo items.\nControversy.\nXXXX's sponsorship of the series caused a number of controversies with Cricket Australia, which was sponsored by another beer brand, Victoria Bitter from Carlton &amp; United Breweries.\nThe Gabba was forced to remove XXXX billboards promoting the series from the ground after the organisation threatened to take away the ground's rights to host future international matches. Cricket Australia claimed that XXXX's billboards were a form of ambush marketing.\nAllan Border was also forced to resign as a national selector for taking part in the series against the wishes of Foster's."

        "title": "2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game",
        "text": "The 2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 80th midseason exhibition between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and the National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was held on July 14, 2009, at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri, the home of the National League St. Louis Cardinals. The game was the first All-Star Game held in St. Louis since 1966. This was the seventh year in which the All-Star Game determined home field advantage in the World Series, with the American League winning all seven games up to and including 2009 under this format. After the game, the National League led the series, 40–38–2, but had not won since 1996. Fox televised the contest, with Joe Buck and Tim McCarver in the booth for the game broadcast, joined at the bottom of the 2nd inning by President Barack Obama. Pre-game coverage began at 5 PM US EDT on MLB Network, with ESPN joining in at 7 PM US EDT. Outside the USA, Rogers Sportsnet (Canada) and ESPN America (Europe) carried MLB's international feed with their own video feed and announcers.\nThe Cardinals had hoped to use the event to show off its planned Ballpark Village residential and entertainment complex to be built on the site of the former Busch Memorial Stadium across the street from the new ballpark. However the plans had not materialized by the time of the game and the Cardinals opted to use the site for a softball field and parking lot instead.\nOn April 22, 2009, All-Star balloting began on MLB.com with eight position players (excluding pitchers and designated hitters) from each of the 30 teams being nominated for fans to vote. As with the prior year, only 25 email ballots could be cast and voting officially ended at 11:59 ET on July 2. Final rosters, with the exception of the final vote, were announced on July 5.\nFans voted for up to three players per league to participate in the State Farm Home Run Derby. For the first time, the batting practice sessions were telecast on the self-owned MLB Network.\nBy length of time, this was the shortest MLB All-Star game (2:31) since 1988. At one point during the game, the American League retired 18 straight batters, the second most in All-Star game history.\nFinal roster spot.\nAfter the rosters were revealed, a second ballot of five players per league was created for the All-Star Final Vote to determine the 33rd and final player of each roster. The NL Winner was Shane Victorino of the Philadelphia Phillies and the AL winner was Brandon Inge of the Detroit Tigers. Pablo Sandoval and Ian Kinsler finished a close second in their respective leagues.\nCoaching staff.\nAmerican League team manager Joe Maddon of the Tampa Bay Rays selected Kansas City Royals manager Trey Hillman and Seattle Mariners manager Don Wakamatsu as coaches for the team along with the rest of his Tampa Bay staff. Both Hillman and Wakamatsu participated in their first All-Star game this year, while Maddon managed the All-Star squad for the first time after participating as a coach in 2003.\nNational League manager Charlie Manuel of the Philadelphia Phillies selected Tony La Russa of the host St. Louis Cardinals and Joe Torre of the Los Angeles Dodgers as his coaches. Torre previously managed the Cardinals from 1990-1995. La Russa has managed an All-Star team five times, and led the 2005 and 2007 NL teams. This was Torre's first NL All-Star coaching position; he has managed an AL All-Star team six times. Manuel previously coached the AL All-Star team in 2002's tie game under Torre.\nRosters.\nVotes were cast online and at the 30 MLB ballparks. Verizon replaced Monster as the sponsor of the online portion of balloting. There was a limit of 25 votes per e-mail address, but no limit to the number of ballots cast at the stadium. The deadline to cast votes was July 2, and the results were broadcast on the TBS All-Star Selection show on July 5. Albert Pujols was the leading vote-getter in the majors with 5,397,374 votes, while Derek Jeter was the vote leader in the American League.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nGame.\nCeremonies.\n\"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was sung by Sheryl Crow for the second year in a row. Stan Musial, a former player for the host St. Louis Cardinals and a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame, gave the baseball for the ceremonial first pitch to the President of the United States Barack Obama, who threw it to the hometown Cardinals' first baseman and leading All-Star vote-getter, Albert Pujols, while wearing a White Sox jacket. During the seventh-inning stretch, Sara Evans sang \"God Bless America\".\nBy contrast, little attention was paid to the Canadian national anthem, \"O Canada\". An instrumental version was played through stadium speakers during the opening ceremonies, a move criticized by Canadian player Justin Morneau.\nGame summary.\nThe American League got off to a quick start in the top of the first inning by scoring two runs. Ichiro Suzuki led off the game with a single to right field, then Derek Jeter reached base on a hit-by-pitch. With one out, Mark Teixeira hit a groundball that was misplayed by first baseman Albert Pujols allowing Jeter to score the game's first run. Josh Hamilton later added an RBI groundout. The National League answered in the bottom of the second inning by scoring three runs. Singles by David Wright, Shane Victorino and Yadier Molina, plus a ground rule double by Prince Fielder, all with two outs, gave the NL the lead. The American League tied the score at three in the fifth on a two-out double by Joe Mauer off Chad Billingsley, and retook the lead when Adam Jones drove in Curtis Granderson, who tripled off Heath Bell, on a sacrifice fly in the eighth. American League pitchers at one point retired 18 straight batters (and 22 of the final 24) on just 48 pitches before Joe Nathan walked Adrián González with two outs in the eighth. Nathan, however, struck out Ryan Howard with runners on second and third to end the threat. Mariano Rivera pitched a perfect ninth inning to earn a record fourth All-Star Game save. Carl Crawford went 1-for-3 but made a great defensive catch in the seventh inning to rob Brad Hawpe of a home run. Crawford was given the MLB All-Star Game's Most Valuable Player award.\nThis was the seventh straight win for the American League since the All-Star game had first been used to determine home-field advantage for the World Series. The AL improved to 12-0-1 since its 1996 defeat in Philadelphia — the longest unbeaten streak in All-Star history. It was also the first All-Star game without a home run by either league since the 1999 Midsummer Classic in Fenway Park.\nBroadcasters.\nThe game was televised live in the United States, and in Canada through the Fox Network by Fox Sports, with announcers Joe Buck (play-by-play); Tim McCarver (color commentator); and Ken Rosenthal, Chris Rose, and Eric Karros (field reporters). MLB International televised the game in English outside of the U.S., with announcers Gary Thorne (play-by-play) and Rick Sutcliffe (color commentator). The American Forces Network also carried the game to U.S. service personnel stationed around the globe.\nESPN Radio broadcast the game, with Dan Shulman (play-by-play) and Dave Campbell (color commentator). Peter Pascarelli and John Rooney served as field reporters."

Simmons played for Green Bay for four and a half years, earning a Super Bowl ring at the end of the 1996 season. Simmons was well known for shutting down opposing tight ends, but in doing this task extremely well he was not able to obtain the attention-grabbing statistics of quarterback sacks.

The Chiefs waived Simmons in 1998 after a 30–7 Monday Night loss to their arch-rival Denver Broncos, in which Simmons and fellow linebacker Derrick Thomas were called for a total of five personal fouls on the Broncos' final touchdown drive. The Buffalo Bills claimed Simmons off waivers on November 19, 1998, and he played five games before being released by the team in February 1999.\nDeath.\nIn the early morning hours of August 23, 2002, Simmons was killed at the age of 32 in a single-car crash on Interstate 70 in Independence, Missouri.

        "text": "Michael Craig Russell (born May 1, 1978) is an American former professional tennis player, and tennis coach. He reached a career-high singles ranking of World No. 60 in August 2007. His 23 United States Tennis Association (USTA) Pro Circuit singles titles were the all-time record, as of November 2013. That month he became the American No. 3.\nIn 1994 Russell was ranked No. 1 in both singles and doubles in the USTA Boys' 16 rankings, and in 1996 he was ranked No. 1 in singles in the U.S. Boys' 18-Under. Playing for the University of Miami in 1996–97, he was named National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Rookie of the Year, before he turned pro in 1997. A high school valedictorian, Russell was one of few Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) players in his time who had a college degree, having earned a B.S. from the University of Phoenix with a 3.94 grade point average.\nRussell struggled with knee injuries for much of his professional career. He is perhaps best known for, on two occasions, holding surprise two-set leads in major tournaments against former major champions, before eventually being defeated both times. In the fourth round of the 2001 French Open (his best run at a major) against defending and eventual champion Gustavo Kuerten (as well as the contemporary world No. 1), Russell led two-sets-to love and 5–3 in the third set, and held a match point, but was defeated in five sets. In the 2007 Australian Open, he held a two-sets-to-love lead over former US Open and Wimbledon champion Lleyton Hewitt, before succumbing in five sets. Other career highlights include a fourth-round showing at the 2007 Indian Wells Masters event, a semifinal appearance at the 2012 U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships, and wins against top-10 players Mardy Fish and Tomáš Berdych. On the Challenger Tour, he finished his career at No. 8 in match wins (276) and tied for fifth in titles (15).\nRussell started Michael Russell Tennis, a private tennis coaching business in 2015. He has coached Frances Tiafoe, Ryan Harrison, Sam Querrey, Taylor Fritz and Mackenzie McDonald through USTA Player Development.\nPersonal life.\nRussell, who is Jewish, was born in Detroit, Michigan. He started playing tennis at age five with his father, George, who was formerly a member of the University of Michigan's Big Ten Conference 1965 championship team. His mother, Carole, also attended the University of Michigan, and is an English teacher. His older brother David played tennis at Princeton University, and attended Harvard Business School.\nRussell grew up in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, a Detroit suburb. He attended Birmingham Detroit Country Day School. He played soccer until his freshman year of high school.\nIn 1995, Russell was the valedictorian at Saddlebrook High School in Florida. He then attended the University of Miami in 1996–97.\nRussell married his wife Lilly, a fitness competitor whom he had met in 2004, on November 10, 2007. His nicknames include \"Mighty Mouse\", \"Spanky\", \"Wheels\", and \"Iron Mike\".\nHe was one of the few Association of Tennis Professionals players while he played who had a college degree, having earned a Bachelor of Science in business administration from the University of Phoenix in January 2012. Russell graduated with Honors and a 3.94 grade point average. He reflected, \"I was raised, as are most Jewish people, not to forego a university education.\"\nTennis career.\nJunior career.\nIn 1991, Russell lost in the finals of the 1991 USTA National Boys' 14 Indoor Championships.

He was a doubles quarterfinalist with Kim at the 1996 Wimbledon junior championships. He won the USTA Midwest Section 1996 Wallace R. Holzman Sr. Award.\nCollege career.\nRussell played number one singles for the University of Miami in 1996–97. He was named 1997 NCAA Rookie of the Year and an All-American, and finished # 7 in collegiate rankings (and # 1 among freshmen), before he turned pro in 1997. His 39 singles match wins were a school record, and he was the first freshman since 1986 to win the Rolex National Intercollegiate Indoor Championships, defeating Fred Niemeyer in the finals. He was also named to the 1997 Rolex Collegiate All-Star Team, selected by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association and \"Tennis Magazine\", and the Big East Championship Most Outstanding Player.\n1997–2002.\nA week before he was to go pro in 1997, while serving to Andre Agassi during a 1997 practice session in North Carolina he suffered a spiral fracture of the humerus bone in his right arm. He spent the next five months rehabbing his arm. In 1997 Russell won USTA Satellite Circuit tournaments in Waco, Texas, Springfield, Missouri, and St. Joseph, Missouri.\nIn 1998, he won the singles title at the USTA Satellite in Mobile, Alabama. In 1999, Russell won USTA Futures events in Vero Beach, Florida, and Weston, Florida.\nIn 2000, Russell won the USTA Challenger in Amarillo, Texas, defeating Stefano Pescosolido in the finals, and won the doubles title with Tommy Robredo at the Edinburgh, Scotland, Challenger. He also won his first ATP match, defeating Hugo Armando in the first round of the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships in Orlando, Florida. He was named a practice partner for the United States Davis Cup team for the U.S. vs. Spain Davis Cup semifinal in Santander, Spain.\nIn 2001, he finished ranked in the top 100 in the world. Russell won the singles and doubles, with Robert Kendrick, championships at the USTA Futures event in Mobile, Alabama. He became the first player to play his way into four consecutive Grand Slam events in succession through qualifiers (2000 Wimbledon, US Open; 2001 Australian Open, Roland Garros).\nIn his French Open debut, as a qualifier he advanced to the fourth round. There, he faced world # 1 Gustavo Kuerten, the defending champion, whom he beat in the first two sets. He had match point at 5–3 in the third set, and was serving. But Kuerten saved the match point at the end of a 26-stroke rally with a forehand winner that landed on the baseline. \"It's unfortunate we have umpires\", Russell joked, \"because I would have called it out.\" Kuerten then came back to defeat Russell in the 205-minute match 3–6, 4–6, 7–6(7), 6–3, 6–1.\n2003–present.\nIn 2003, Russell was hampered by a right knee injury for much of the year. He had arthroscopic surgery in May. Between 2003 and the following year he had three knee surgeries to address a condition that had been hampering him known as osteochondritis dissecans. It is a genetic disorder usually found in 16-year-olds, in which his bone and cartilage separated and broke off from the rest of his knee and femur. He ultimately required surgery on both his knees. His father said: He reminds me of Don Quixote … [tilting] at those windmills. For every success, I can tell you, there's been hours on the couch with ice bags on his knees. After the third knee operation, most people would have thrown up their hands and said, 'I'm star-crossed, I can't do it.' But Michael has persevered. That's why he's our hero.\nIn 2004, he won singles titles at the USTA Futures event in Buffalo, New York, defeating Jorge Aguilar in the finals, at the USTA Futures event in Pittsburgh, and at the ITF Futures event in Quebec, Canada. In June 2005, Russell tore his right hamstring in a tournament in Ecuador. He spent four and a half months in rehab, and began taking courses at University of California, Berkeley by the internet. Flying home on a 20-hour flight from the qualifying for the 2006 Australian Open, he developed blood clots in both of his lungs. He had his problem treated with ten days of injections of the blood thinners Coumadin and Lovenox.\nIn 2007 he won a Challenger tournament in Nouméa, New Caledonia. Two weeks later, in the first round of the 2007 Australian Open, Russell led former # 1 player Lleyton Hewitt two sets to love on center court before succumbing. In the 2007 Indian Wells Masters event, he made it to the final 16 players in a 96-player field, after upsetting 11th seed – and 12th-ranked – Tomáš Berdych in round 2 in straight sets. In his first ten years as a pro tennis player he won approximately $750,000 in official prize money. But as sportswriter Greg Garber wrote in an ESPN article, after expenses, \"In terms of net income, a minimum-wage worker at McDonald's did better financially than Russell did during the nine years before 2007.\"\nOn May 25, 2008, he was named USTA Circuit Player of the Week after winning three consecutive singles titles. In April 2010, he was at the age of 31 the third-oldest player in the men's top 75. \nRussell made his first ATP semi-final at the 2012 U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships in Houston, Texas. He came through qualifying and beat top seed, world # 9 and compatriot Mardy Fish in straight sets on his way to a three-set loss to Juan Mónaco. The win against Fish was his first over a top-10 player. He ended the 2012 season as the third-oldest man in the ATP Top 100.\nRussell, as a lucky loser, made it to the quarterfinals of the 2013 U.S. National Indoor Tennis Championships, losing to Denis Istomin in straight sets. In November 2013, he won an ATP Challenger in Charlottesville by coming back from 0–5 in the final set against Canadian Peter Polansky for the win.\nThe victory pushed him into the top 80 in the world rankings, and he became the third-highest-ranked American in the world. His 23 USTA Pro Circuit singles titles as of November 2013 was the all-time record. At the 2014 Rogers Cup in Toronto, he pushed David Ferrer to come up with his best tennis.\nIn 2015 at 36 years of age, Russell earned a spot representing premier American men's professional tennis at the Australian Open. He was later defeated in the first round of the Tournament in Melbourne. Annually, the Australian Open serves as the initial Grand Slam event in the (ITF) professional series.\nRussell retired from professional tennis at the 2015 US Open, at 37 years of age. On the Challenger Tour, he finished his career at No. 8 in match wins (276) and tied for fifth in titles (15).\nPlaying style.\nRussell has \"startling acceleration, precise footwork and, most important, a voracious work ethic.\" He is a defensive counter-puncher, known for his foot speed, consistency, forehand, and fitness. John McEnroe described him as a particularly dogged competitor, saying that \"no one's going to try harder on a tennis court than Michael Russell\".\nPeople questioned his potential when he was a junior because they thought he was too little for pro tennis. An ESPN article in 2007, noting that he was 5-foot-8 and weighed 160 pounds, called him: \"one of the smallest players in the professional game.\"\nCoaching.\nIn 2015, Russell started Michael Russell Tennis, a private tennis coaching business in Houston, Texas.\nRussell has coached Frances Tiafoe, Ryan Harrison, Sam Querrey, Taylor Fritz, Mackenzie McDonald and Tennys Sandgren on the ATP WorldTour through USTA Player Development.\nHe is the current private coach of Taylor Fritz.\nPerformance timelines.\nSingles.\n1 Held as Hamburg Masters (outdoor clay) until 2008, Madrid Masters (outdoor clay) 2009–present.&lt;br&gt;\n2 Held as Stuttgart Masters (indoor hard) until 2001, Madrid Masters (indoor hard) from 2002 to 2008, and Shanghai Masters (outdoor hard) 2009–present."

        "text": "Manuel Jose Fernandez (born July 3, 1946) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive lineman for eight seasons with the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Utah Utes. He played in three consecutive Super Bowls for the Dolphins in the 1971, 1972, and 1973 seasons.\nHigh school career.\nAt San Lorenzo High School in San Lorenzo, California, he played football, wrestled, and threw the discus.\nCollege career.\nFernandez attended Chabot Junior College before enrolling at Utah under head coach Mike Giddings. Fernandez wore number 65 at Utah and was a three-year letterman.\nFernandez went undrafted and signed with the Dolphins.\nNFL career.\nFernandez was a strong contender for MVP of Super Bowl VII. Wrote Nick Buoniconti, \"It was the game of his life–in fact, it was the most dominant game by a defensive lineman in the history of the game, and he would never be given much credit for it. They should have given out two game balls and made Manny Fernandez the co-MVP with Jake Scott.\" Larry Csonka also said he thought Fernandez should have been the MVP. The MVP was selected by Dick Schaap, the editor of \"Sport\" magazine. Schaap admitted later that he had been out late the previous night, struggled to watch the defense-dominated game, and was not aware that Fernandez had 17 tackles. Fernandez also recorded a sack against the Washington Redskins' quarterback Billy Kilmer.\n\"Winning the car never entered my mind until I heard that Jake won it,\" Fernandez said in the January 1974 issue of \"Sport\" magazine. \"I was happy for Jake, he played a helluva game for a guy who was healthy but he had two bad shoulders.\"\nThe following year, Fernandez recorded 5 tackles and 1 sack in Super Bowl VIII against the Minnesota Vikings. Two years earlier, Fernandez recorded 6 tackles, 1 sack and recovered a fumble in the Dolphins loss to the Dallas Cowboys. In his three Super Bowls Fernandez recorded three sacks and 28 tackles.\nFor his career Fernandez had 35 career sacks, a high number for a nose tackle, with a career high of 8 in 1971, which led the Dolphins. In Dolphin history only one nose tackle (Bob Baumhower: 39.5) recorded more sacks. Fernandez recorded 5.5 sacks in post-season play which is currently 3rd in Dolphins history behind defensive ends Kim Bokamper (8) and Trace Armstrong (6).\nFernandez was 2nd team All-Pro in 1970 and 1973, and an All-AFC selection in 1971 and a second-team All-AFC choice in 1972 and 1973, marking four consecutive season with post-season honors. Fernandez is also credited with being one of the first nose tackles in the NFL, since the Dolphins played the famed \"53\" defense (which was a 3–4 defense) in 1972 through 1974, which put Manny over the center. Likely, no team played the 3–4 defense more until the New England Patriots when went to the 3–4 full-time in 1974.\nIn 2007 was voted to the Dolphins All-Time team. Fernandez had previously been voted to the 1990 Dolphins Silver Anniversary Team that celebrated the Dolphins' 25 years in the NFL. From 1968 through 1973 Fernandez was voted as the Dolphins' \"Outstanding Defensive Lineman\", even though Pro Bowlers like Bill Stanfill and Vern Den Herder were on the same line.\nIn January 2001, Fernandez was named to \"Pro Football Weekly\"s All-Time Super Bowl team. In 2006, \"USA Today\" named him to their All-time Super Bowl team.\nIn 2013, President Barack Obama honored the entire 1972 Perfect Season Dolphins at an event in the White House, but Fernandez declined to attend. He told sports columnist Dave Hyde of Ft. Lauderdale's \"Sun-Sentinel\" \"I'll just say my views are diametrically opposed to the President's... Enough said. Let's leave it at that. I hope everyone enjoys the trip who goes.\"\nOn December 21, 2014, Fernandez was inducted into the Miami Dolphin Honor Roll at Sun Life Stadium. On January 30, 2014, Frank Schwab from Yahoo! Sports ranked Manny Fernandez as the tenth-best player of all time in the past 48 Super Bowls."

Cruiserweight (86 kg) was added in 1998.\nBy 1994, the ABA Championships became a purely English affair as Scottish and Welsh boxers could no longer compete due to disagreements over rules and regulations.\nIn 2012/3 the weights were revised, deleting light middleweight (71 kg) and cruiserweight (86 kg), also increasing welter weight from 67 kg to 69 kg. So today a total of eleven weight categories are contested. The ABA Champion is automatically selected to represent England in the Four Nations Championship in that year (England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales).\nIn 2019 the Championships were renamed the England Boxing National Amateur Championships and the 2020 Championships were cancelled due to COVID-19. In 2022, another re-organisation of the weight categories resulted in the light-middleweight division returning.\nLocations.\nThe inaugural Championships were held at St James Hall, London on 18 April 1880. In 1926, the Championships moved to the Royal Albert Hall London after moving around different venues within the Capital City (St. James Hall, Alexandra Palace, Northampton Institute, Holborn Central Hall, Royal Aquarium, Her Majesty's Theatre, People's Palace and the Holland Park Ring). From 1946 until 1990 the Championships were held at the Wembley Arena.\nSince 1990 the locations have varied."

        "title": "Australian Open extreme heat policy",
        "text": "The Extreme Heat Policy is a rule pertaining to the Australian Open (tennis). It was introduced in 1998 after consultation with a number of tennis players. Its current iteration was first implemented in 2019 and uses a scale of 1 to 5 that accounts for the physiological variances between adults, wheelchair and junior athletes while also taking into account the four climate factors – air temperature, radiant heat or the strength of the sun, humidity and wind speed – which affect a player’s ability to disperse heat from their body.\nChanges for 2015.\nFollowing severe criticism of the handling of the 2014 Australian Open, organisers increased the temperature threshold from the 2003 level of and increased the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) threshold from the 2003 level of to allow for more continuous play and fewer stoppages in the future.\nWBGT charts show that the new threshold may not be triggered even if the temperature reaches when there is no humidity.\nWhen the policy is implemented, matches will now be halted after an even number of games in the set, rather than at the conclusion of the set.\nThere will also be a retractable roof available on Margaret Court Arena for the first time.\nHistory.\nIn 1988, Rod Laver Arena opened making the Australian Open the first Grand Slam to feature a retractable roof. The initial heat policy allowed for the roof to be closed when the temperature rose above or at the referee's discretion when the temperature rose above , but only for daytime matches and only once all singles matches could be scheduled inside Rod Laver Arena. This effectively meant that the heat policy could only go in effect in the quarterfinals or later in the tournament.\nOfficials considered closing the roof for the final in 1993 due to a temperature of , but Jim Courier threatened to boycott the match unless the roof remained open.\nThe heat rule was first invoked during the quarterfinal round in 1997.\nIn 1998, a new policy was implemented calling for play on all courts to be stopped if the temperature reached . This was later changed in 2002 to .\nThe 2002 women's final was played in heat, which triggered a 10-minute break between the 2nd and 3rd sets but no halt in play.\nBeginning with the 2003 tournament the policy was changed to and a WBGT of .\nThe new policy was invoked on January 20, 2003 on a day when the temperature reached and the WBGT reached the mark. Play was halted for the minimum 2 hours.\nAfter the extreme heat policy was invoked in consecutive years in 2006 and 2007, the policy was again changed starting in 2008 to allow matches in progress to be halted at the conclusion of the set. Prior to that a match already underway had to be completed. The policy was further changed in 2008 to allow play to be stopped only at the discretion of the tournament referee, rather than relying solely on temperature and WBGT calculations.\nThe policy was invoked several times in 2009, the hottest tournament to date with an average temperature of .\nThe policy was invoked on day 2 of the 2023 tournament was temperatures reached 98 degrees Fahrenheit with a feel of 101 degrees Fahrenheit. Play was suspended on all courts that did not have a roof.\nCriticism.\n2014.\nThe extreme heat policy came under criticism during the 2014 Australian Open after ballboys, attendants in the stands, and players were suffering various heat-related illnesses due to four consecutive days with highs between , but organizers claimed the humidity remained low enough on all but one day for the policy not to be enforced; tournament referee Wayne McKewen said that \"While conditions were hot and uncomfortable, the relatively low level of humidity ensured that conditions never deteriorated to a point where it was necessary to invoke the extreme heat policy\". Frank Dancevic, who began to hallucinate and collapse during his 6–7(12–14), 3–6, 4–6 loss to Benoît Paire, described the conditions as \"inhumane\" while severely criticising the policy, and Andy Murray voiced his concerns about people's safety, stating that \"it only takes one bad thing to happen\". Ivan Dodig, who also collapsed and was forced to retire, said afterwards that he feared he might die in the extreme conditions. Nine players retired during the second day, while Daniel Gimeno-Traver carried off a ball boy who fainted during his match and Peng Shuai was amongst many throughout the tournament that required medical attention. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Caroline Wozniacki noted that their shoes and water bottles were beginning to melt in the conditions, while Serena Williams and Victoria Azarenka said that the heat was affecting their play.\nRoger Federer, however, agreed with the referee's decision, saying that adequate training and preparation should be enough to cope with the weather. Gilles Simon, who was injured prior to the tournament, took a similar view and said that the heat improved his game.\nOn the second day of the tournament the temperature reached . On the third day it reached . On the fourth day it reached . On the fifth day it reached with 6% humidity. Play continued uninterrupted for the second, third, and fifth days and was stopped for 4 hours on the fourth day. For many players the stoppage was closer to 3 hours because they had to complete the set in progress even after the policy went into effect. On Rod Laver Arena, Maria Sharapova and Karin Knapp had to complete a 3rd set that lasted nearly 2 hours and 18 games. On the third day 970 fans had been treated for heat exhaustion.\nWhile the exact WBGT on these days has not been revealed by the organizers, it is clear that had the earlier 1998 policy been still in effect play would have been halted all 4 days once the temperature exceeded 40 degrees Celsius.\nThe extreme heat resulted in a record number of 9 withdraws in the first round.\nSpectator lawsuit.\nOn January 24, 2015, the \"Herald Sun\" reported that Susan Carman sued the Melbourne &amp; Olympic Parks Trust for failing to close the roof at Hisense Arena during Andy Murray's second round match in the 2013 Australian Open. The temperature that day reached . Carman says she fell down the stairs while seeking shade."

Auckland also had a good record, with three wins and a loss after a first-innings lead to Canterbury, while Wellington won the annual clash with Nelson to end with a 1–1 record.\nMatches in Canterbury and Auckland were played with four-ball overs, the remainder with five-ball overs.\nEvents.\nAuckland's December tour.\nIn the first clash between the sides since 1877, Canterbury fought off Auckland quick bowler William Lankham, who took eleven for 99 on first class debut, and a first-innings deficit of 32 to clinch victory on the final day. David Ashby and George Watson made a fourth-wicket stand of 64, the second largest stand of the game after Watson had made 81 for the second wicket with William Reeves in the first innings, and Canterbury closed with a lead of 123 with five wickets in hand. On the third morning, ten wickets fell for 50 runs, five of them Auckland wickets, and they now required 124 to win. However, William Frith completed a ten-wicket haul to help Canterbury to a 27-run win.\nAuckland retained their unbeaten record against Wellington, who despite winning the toss trailed by 80 runs on first innings, with Robert Yates' 49 the top score. Lankham continued his good tour with four wickets in the second innings, ending with 18 wickets thus far.\nAuckland ended the tour with a 2–1 record after a narrow win at Nelson, with Nelson bowler James Wigzell taking his only career five-wicket haul after the Nelson captain put Auckland in to bat. Then the hosts were all out for 33, with four ducks and no double-digit scores, with Lankham taking six wickets and two men run out. Wigzell ended with nine wickets, and Nelson nearly chased down the target of 155; in the final partnership, the nine and eleven batsmen made 22 not out and 30 respectively, before Auckland opening bowler William Buckland struck to seal the win.\nAuckland's tour also included four non-first-class matches before the Canterbury match, against teams from Dunedin, Oamaru, Timaru and Ashburton, all of which Auckland won. The 12-man team left Auckland by ship on 16 November, and returned on 17 December."

        "text": "This article describes the history of West Indies cricket from 1971 to 1980.\nThe West Indies cricket team was in transition as the 1970s began and it suffered a humiliating series defeat on the 1975–76 tour of Australia. New captain Clive Lloyd was determined that such a defeat must never happen again and decided that the lessons of that tour must be learned. On the 1975–76 tour, the difference between the two teams was the aggressive pace bowling of Jeff Thomson and Dennis Lillee. Lloyd decided that West Indies must nurture its own pace battery to create similar havoc among its opponents. The emergence of Andy Roberts and Michael Holding at this time ensured that the first implementation of the new policy on the 1976 tour of England was a success. West Indies could still produce great batsmen too and few have been better than Viv Richards.\nThe combination of outstanding pace bowling and top-class batting enabled West Indies to dominate world cricket for more than 15 years until the 1990s.\nDomestic cricket 1970–71 to 1980.\n1970–71 season.\nSource:\nTrinidad and Tobago, captained by Joey Carew, retained their Shell Shield title. They beat Combined Islands and Barbados, and drew with Jamaica and Guyana.\nThe Beaumont Cup, a first-class knock-out competition competed for by North Trinidad, South Trinidad, Central Trinidad and East Trinidad, was retained by North Trinidad when the final between themselves and East Trinidad was drawn. This was the first season in which the competition had been expanded to four teams. From its inception in 1926, only North and South Trinidad had previously competed.\n1970–71 Shell Shield Table.\nNote: DWF = drawn, won on first innings. LWF = drawn, lost on first innings.\nLeading bowlers 1970–71.\nQualification: 10 or more wickets.\nInternational tours 1970–71 to 1980.\nIndia 1970–71.\nIndia defeated West Indies by one match to nil, with four matches drawn. Their win came in the second Test, at Port-of-Spain. It was their first win in 25 Tests between the two countries. Sunil Gavaskar, aged twenty-one and in his first Test series, scored 774 runs in four Tests, at an average of 154.80. Srinivasaraghavan Venkataraghavan took 22 wickets at 33.91."

The name \"Nondescripts\" is derived from the fact it was intended to be open to anyone, unlike other Colombo-based clubs at the time such as Sinhalese Sports Club, Moors Sports Club and Tamil Union Cricket &amp; Athletic Club which were aligned with a particular ethnic group.\nHonours.\n1952–53, \n1953–54, \n1954–55, \n1956–57, \n1957–58, \n1960–61, \n1969–70, \n1970–71, \n1975–76,\n1976–77, \n1978–79,\n1985–86, \n1988–89,\n1993–94,\n2000–01,\n2013–14\n2008–09 \n2009–10\nCurrent squad.\nPlayers with international caps are listed in bold. (Updated as of 24 July 2022)\nOther Nondescripts clubs.\nThe name 'Nondescripts Cricket Club' derives from a 19th-century London-based team. The Nondescripts were a 'wandering' cricket club with no fixed ground and a team composed of players of all standards. A New Zealand Nondescripts Club was established in 1962 to promote \"the principles of the game of Cricket, especially sportsmanship and high standards in dress, attitude and application.\" It too is a 'wandering' club drawn mainly from Wellington and Lower Hutt players; eight NZ internationals have played for the club, including Ewen Chatfield, John Reid and Bob Blair. In the 1980s, a Nondescripts Cricket Club played in the Brunei cricket league. Consisting largely of Sri Lankan expatriates, both Sinhalese and Tamil, it later merged with another club and changed its name.\nNotable players.\nPlayers who have represented Ceylon in cricket\nPlayers to have represented Sri Lanka at Test cricket"

        "title": "Mark Webster (darts player)",
        "text": "Mark Webster (born 12 August 1983) is a Welsh former professional darts player. Nicknamed Webby and The Spider, he played in Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) events. Webster began his career on the British Darts Organisation (BDO) circuit, winning the BDO World Championship in 2008. He became a full-time professional in 2009, having previously been a fully qualified registered plumber. He now works as an analyst and commentator on Sky Sports and ITV.\nDarts career.\nWebster made progress once he was aged 12 and could play in Local Darts Leagues in public houses in his native North Wales. He started playing for the local \"Golden Lion\" team like both of his parents, and still plays regularly for his pub team \"The Masons\"\nHe first came to prominence in 2006, winning the 2006 WDF Europe Cup, and making the semi-finals of the 2006 Winmau World Masters. In other BDO/WDF tournaments during 2006, he won the Northern Ireland Open and reached the semi-finals of the Welsh Open. However, he underperformed in the subsequent 2007 World Championship, losing on his debut to Tony Eccles 3–0 in the first round.\nIn May 2007, he beat Phil Taylor in the group stages on his way to the final of the International Darts League – however he lost 9–13 to Gary Anderson. However, he added to his growing collection of titles by winning the World Cup Singles in October 2007.\nDespite his lack of major television tournament wins, Webster entered the 2008 BDO World Championship as the number one seed due to his success in open events. This time around, Webster justified his status as joint-favourite for the title (alongside Anderson), as he beat Ian Jones in the first round, popular qualifier Glenn Moody in the last 16 and ninth seed Darryl Fitton in the quarter-finals. He played defending champion Martin Adams in the semi-finals, beating him 6–4 and earning a place in the final. He then beat Simon Whitlock 7–5 in the final on 13 January 2008, to become the third Welshman to win the World Championship of either organisation, after Leighton Rees and Richie Burnett, and only the second left-handed player to win the World Championship in either the PDC or BDO.\nWebster did not play many tournaments in 2008, instead choosing to remain in college to earn his plumbing degree. He did though retain the WDF Europe Cup, beating Northern Ireland's Daryl Gurney in the final. Webster also had a great run into the quarter finals of the 2008 Grand Slam of Darts. After surprisingly losing his opening group game to Colin McGarry, he went on to whitewash Michael van Gerwen 5–0 and despite losing to Mervyn King, Webster went through to the knockout stages on leg difference after McGarry failed to beat van Gerwen. Webster then demolished PDC World Champion John Part 10–2 – in a battle of the incumbent world champions – to reach the quarter finals where he lost again to King. Webster then suffered a last 16 exit in the 2008 World Masters, losing to Ross Montgomery and then went out in the group stages of the Zuiderduin Masters. Having beaten Martin Atkins, he lost to wildcard entrant Henny van der Ster who claimed the quarter final spot ahead of Webster and went on to reach the semi-finals.\nWebster entered the 2009 BDO World Championship as the number two seed. He defeated Dutchman Willy van de Wiel 3–0 in the first round but his title reign came to an end in the second round when he was beaten 4–0 by 2001 Lakeside Champion John Walton.\nPDC career.\n2009–2010.\nWith rumours persisting over a potential switch to the PDC, Webster had remained defiant that he would return to Lakeside in 2010. However, it was announced on 5 February 2009 that Webster had joined the PDC, making his debut at the double-header Players Championship events in Gladbeck at the end of February.\nIn his PDC debut he did not manage to earn any prize money—losing 6–1 to Ronnie Baxter in the opening round. The following day however, Webster got through to the second round of the Sunday event in Gladbeck, earning his first prize money as a PDC player.\nHaving started from scratch in the PDC rankings, Webster had to build up ranking points by entering the PDC Pro Tour events. His best result came at the UK Open Scottish Regional Qualifier in March when he reached the semi-final. He also managed two quarter final appearances in Players Championship Events in the East Midlands in April and Atlanta in August. By 18 October he had played in 31 Pro Tour events. His PDC Prize Money, boosted by a run to the last 16 of the UK Open had totalled £10,800 and his ranking had improved to 71.\nIn his debut at the PDC World Championship in 2010, Webster defeated established players including Mark Walsh, Peter Manley and Co Stompé to reach the semi-final, where he was outplayed by Taylor. Webster did, however, earn the consolation of third place via a playoff match with van Barneveld, earning an extra £20,000 in the process and entering the top 32 in the PDC rankings for the first time.\nHe began 2010 poorly with repeated early exits in Floor events but found form by a few quarter final appearances and by reaching consecutive semi-finals in a Players Championship and UK Open Qualifier 8 in Wigan during May. This cemented his qualification for the 2010 UK Open Darts. However he was knocked out in his first match against Tony Eccles.\nAfter the UK Open his poor floor form returned in which he failed to progress past the last 32 in any event until the 2010 World Matchplay Darts in which he knocked out seventh seed Adrian Lewis 11–9 in the first round but was beaten 13–9 by Co Stompé This earned him £7,500 towards the order of merit.\nHis next major event was the 2010 Championship League Darts which he qualified for due to his order of merit ranking of 29 which put him into the last group – 8. He qualified from the group stage in fourth with wins over Jelle Klaasen, Michael van Gerwen, Dennis Priestley and Denis Ovens this meant that he played group winner Co Stompé in the semi-final in which he prevailed 6–3 however he was beaten 6–2 by Wayne Jones in the group final.\nAfter this competition his floor event form sharply rose with a Victory over Richie Burnett in a Players Championship Final in Germany earning him his first ever PDC tournament victory and £6,000. This was followed soon later with a Semi-final and final appearance in a weekend in Barnsley further pushing him up the order of merit.\nDue to his 3rd-place finish at the previous World Championship Webster qualified for the 2010 Grand Slam of Darts. Despite losing 5–2 to Wayne Jones in his first game a 5–3 win over Mark Hylton left him with a chance to qualify however even though he beat Gary Anderson 5–3 it was not enough as he missed multiple doubles to win the match with the required scoreline of 5–1 to qualify.\nWebster was the Welsh captain for the inaugural 2010 PDC World Cup of Darts in which Barrie Bates was his partner. After beating New Zealand in their first game 6–4 Webster and Bates became the surprise package of the tournament topping their group in the next stage which included wins over the Scottish pairing of Gary Anderson and Robert Thornton and the Spanish team of Carlos Rodriguez and Antonio Alcinas who had knocked out the England team consisting of world number one and two Phil Taylor and James Wade. This meant that they played the Australian team of Simon Whitlock and Paul Nicholson in the Semi-finals. A 6–5 win for Webster over Nicholson in the opening match proved crucial as it kept them in the match after the other 3 matches were won by Australia taking the match the doubles match. They won this 6–4 which meant that the match would go to a sudden death leg to decide who went to the final. Despite Australia winning the throw for the bull and opening with a 180 from Whitlock consecutive 140's from Wales got them back in the match. Bates then held his nerve to take out a 116 to take them to the final which also went to the doubles match after Webster defeated Co Stompé and Raymond van Barneveld back to back with a 100+ average in each match. However they lost the doubles 8–5 to finish runners up in the tournament.\n2011.\nHe continued this good form into the 2011 PDC World Darts Championship in which he knocked out Steve Maish, number 8 seed Ronnie Baxter and Mark Hylton in the early rounds losing only 1 set between them. In the quarter-final he knocked out 15-time and defending world champion Phil Taylor by 5 sets to 2 to reach his second successive World Championship semi-final. He lost 6–4 to Adrian Lewis in the semi-finals, continuing the trend of players beating Taylor but going on to lose their next match when the event is televised. This earned him £50,000 and Moved him into the top 16 of the PDC rankings for the first time at number 13.\nWebster played in the 2011 Premier League. His early form was strong, pushing Taylor hard with a 170 out-shot and avenging his loss to Adrian Lewis with an average of 110.19 – the second highest ever achieved in the Premier league (behind Taylor). However, he then had a great loss in form, receiving 8–1 defeats at the hands of James Wade and Phil Taylor among other heavy losses, leaving him bottom of the table with two wins and a draw from his fourteen matches.\nAt the 2011 UK Open, Webster reached the semi-finals and led James Wade 9–7 in their best-of-19 match, but lost 10–9 despite throwing for the match on two occasions.\nWebster reached his second quarter-final at the Grand Slam of Darts, once again beating John Part en route to a defeat by Lewis.\nWebster finally reached his first PDC major final at the 2011 Players Championship Finals, beating number one seed Justin Pipe after seeing six match darts missed against him, followed by wins over Dave Chisnall and Wes Newton, before being defeated by Kevin Painter.\n2012.\nHis good form from the previous week did not help him, however, at the 2012 World Championship where he was upset by fellow countryman, Richie Burnett, 2–3. Webster had a dart at double top in the deciding set to win the match, but missed and was the highest seed to exit in the first round of the event. He then teamed up with Burnett for his second World Cup and together they reached the semi-finals with wins over Croatia and South Africa. Webster could not reach his second successive World Cup final however, as the English pair of Phil Taylor and Adrian Lewis won 1–3. At the World Matchplay, Webster defeated Colin Lloyd 10–6 in the first round, before losing to Andy Hamilton 6–13 in the last 16. In September, Webster threw a nine darter in the opening leg of his first round match against Andree Welge in Event 4 of the European Tour, but went on to lose 4–6. After all 33 ProTour events of 2012 had been played, Webster was 27th on the Order of Merit, inside the top 32 who qualified for the Players Championship Finals. He lost to Taylor 2–6 in the first round.\n2013.\nWebster beat Ian White in the first round of the 2013 World Championship, but then lost to Colin Lloyd 2–4. He played in his third World Cup of Darts and second with Richie Burnett and they reached the semi-finals where they faced the number one seeds of Phil Taylor and Adrian Lewis. Webster lost to Taylor 1–4, but Burnett defeated Lewis meaning a doubles match was needed to settle the tie. Burnett missed one dart at double ten to complete a 140 finish for the match and Wales would lose 3–4. Webster played Burnett in the third round of the UK Open and was defeated 2–9, and he lost 4–10 to Justin Pipe in the first round of the World Matchplay. Webster beat Wes Newton 5–2 in his opening group game of the Grand Slam of Darts but then lost 5–1 against Simon Whitlock to need a win over Ross Smith to stand a chance of qualifying for the last 16 and he did so 5–3. However, he was tied on points and leg difference with Newton so a nine-dart shootout was required. Webster had already scored enough to not require throwing his final three darts to eliminate Newton and was then defeated 10–6 by reigning BDO world champion Scott Waites.\n2014.\nWebster saw a welcome return to form at the 2014 World Championship by winning each of his first three games in deciding sets over Mensur Suljović (3–2), John Henderson (4–3 having survived three match darts) and Raymond van Barneveld 4–3 (winning the final six legs of the match without reply). He stated after the van Barneveld match that coming into the event his career was on the line as he was close to dropping out of the top 32, but by earning £25,000 for reaching the last eight his place was secured. Webster lost the first three sets of his quarter-final against Michael van Gerwen inside 20 minutes and was also 4–1 down. He then raised his game as the Dutchman's dropped off to win two sets in a row, but lost the next to see his run in the event end with a 5–3 defeat. Van Gerwen was also the victor when the two met in the fifth round of the UK Open, triumphing 9–4. He did not qualify for another major during the rest of the year. Webster and Burnett advanced to the quarter-finals of the World Cup of Darts, where their match against the Australian pairing of Simon Whitlock and Paul Nicholson went into a deciding doubles match which Wales lost 4–0. In November, Webster lost to Jay Foreman 4–2 in the Grand Slam of Darts Wild Card Qualifier which meant that he failed to play in the event for the first time.\n2015.\nWebster saw off Ron Meulenkamp 3–1 in the first round of the 2015 World Championship and then missed one dart to level at 1–1 in the next round against Phil Taylor, going on to be whitewashed 4–0. He just hung on to his top 32 ranking after the event as he was the world number 32. At the first UK Open Qualifier of the year, Webster reached his first semi-final in an individual event for three years where he was edged out 6–5 by Michael van Gerwen. The result helped him enter the UK Open at the third round stage but he was beaten 9–5 by William O'Connor. Webster played with Jamie Lewis at the World Cup for the first time and they suffered a surprise 5–3 loss to Hong Kong in the opening round.\nWebster took advantage of Stephen Bunting missing too many doubles in their first round match at the World Grand Prix to defeat him 2–1 in sets and then produced a very good performance in seeing off world number five Adrian Lewis 3–0 with an average of 92 in the double-start event. In Webster's first major quarter-final in 18 months he continued his run by edging past Jelle Klaasen 3–2 in a deciding leg. He attributed his form in the event to the birth of his daughter Ella which Webster said had given him a new lease of life. Webster's first major semi-final in almost four years ended with a 4–1 loss to reigning champion Michael van Gerwen. 5–3 wins over Keegan Brown and Michel van der Horst helped Webster qualify from his group at the Grand Slam and he then took out 10 of his 14 attempts at a double to eliminate Gary Anderson 10–6. However, the opposite happened in the quarter-finals against Raymond van Barneveld as Webster could only hit 34% of his doubles to be beaten 16–12.\n2016.\nWebster did not drop a set in seeing off Mick McGowan and Terry Jenkins at the 2016 World Championship, but then lost 4–1 to Alan Norris in the third round. Two semi-finals and a quarter-final in the UK Open Qualifiers saw him finish fifth on the Order of Merit to enter the UK Open at the third round stage. He defeated Matthew Edgar 9–3, Dirk van Duijvenbode 9–4 and Mensur Suljović 9–5 to reach his third major quarter-final in six months and was comfortably beaten 10–3 by Phil Taylor. Webster and Gerwyn Price lost 4–2 in a doubles match in the second round of the World Cup. After his 10–6 defeat to Adrian Lewis in the opening round of the World Matchplay, Webster said that dartitis, which he has fought over the past few years, was evident in the latter half of the game and that he was trying to beat the player and himself during matches. He reached one Pro Tour quarter-final during the rest of the year as well as losing in the first round of the Players Championship Finals.\n2017.\nWebster saw off Joe Murnan 3–0 in the first round of the 2017 World Championship and then held on when Mensur Suljović rallied from 3–1 down, by taking all three legs in the deciding set to win 4–3 and reach the third round for the second successive year. The opposite then happened as it was Webster who levelled at 3–3 having been 3–1 down, but Daryl Gurney took the seventh set by three legs to one to progress 4–3. Victories over Finland, Ireland and Russia helped Webster and Gerwyn Price into the semi-finals of the World Cup. A pair of 4–2 wins over the Belgian team of Kim and Ronny Huybrechts saw them play in the final, where their only point came courtesy of a Webster win over Raymond van Barneveld as they went down 3–1 to the Dutch. Webster has been battling dartitis in recent years, but hoped that this result in a team event could boost his individual performances.\n2020.\nHe announced that he does not intend to participate in the 2020 Q School to regain his tour card. He has said that he will take the year out to get his game right, in order to get back to his former level.\nPerformance timeline.\nBDO\nPDC"

        "text": "Masters swimming is a special class of competitive swimming for swimmers 25 years and older. Premasters is normally included as well, from 18 years old (Canada, United States and Australia) or 20 years old (Europe).\nIn Canada ten thousand swimmers in more than 250 clubs are organized within the Masters Swimming Canada organization. In the United States around sixty thousand masters swimmers are supported by U.S. Masters Swimming, in more than 1,500 masters swimming clubs or workout groups.\nRules.\nThe rules and distances are nearly the same as for senior swimming. However, \"breaststroke kicking movement is permitted for butterfly,\" and meet programs include mixed relay events (2 men / 2 women). The latter one is now copied by seniors.\nAge categories.\nIndividual swimmers compete within age groups of five years, determined by the swimmer's age on 31 December current year (in U.S. for meets held in non-metric pools, the age is determined as of the day of the competition). \nThe age groups are: A:25–29 (years old), B:30–34, C:35–39, D:40–44; E:45–49; F:50–54, G:55–59; H:60–64, I:65–69, J:70–74; K:75–79; L:80–84, M:85–89, N:90–94, P:95–99, Q:100–104, R:105–109 and so on at 5-year increments as necessary. In 2014 Jaring Timmermann from Canada, at the age of 105, set a world record as the oldest, but he died the same year.\nFor Masters relay events, the age groups are determined by the combined age of the team participants in 40 years increments. This allows swimmers of very different ages to compete together in a team, as long as each swimmer is Masters (at least 25 years old). Combined age: A:100–119 (years old), B:120–159, C:160–199, D:200–239, E:240–279, F:280–319, G:320–359 and so on if ever necessary.\nDescription.\nMasters swimming is a fast-growing leisure activity, particularly in North America and Australia but also in Europe. Most towns or cities now have masters clubs. Typically these are very friendly and welcome newcomers. The minimum requirements to join a masters club vary widely, anywhere from the ability to swim one length of the pool to the ability to swim a kilometre without stopping. Club members will follow a set of different drills and swims each time typically covering anything from 1.5 km to 3.5 km per one-hour session. Each club will have lanes and so whilst the younger and faster swimmers who are competing nationally and regionally are at one end, the other lanes are for hobbyists who may have taken up swimming quite recently.\nU.S. Masters Swimming is the governing body of masters swimming in the United States, sponsoring competition at all levels. In addition, it sponsors programs for non-competitive \"fitness\" swimmers who train primarily for the health benefits that the activity offers to the aging athlete.\nMasters Swimming Canada is the governing body of masters swimming in Canada, listing swim clubs, competitions and provincial master swim associations.\nFINA World Masters Championships.\nFINA organizes the FINA World Masters Championships since 1986, but 2 editions were held in the pre-FINA era:\nRecords.\nAs in senior swimming, there are world records for masters swimming, but they can only be set in a sanctioned masters meet. Official list of Masters swimming records are available at the FINA website masters section."

        "text": "The is one of the two minor leagues (\"ni-gun\") of Japanese professional baseball. The league is owned and managed by the Pacific League of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). \nThe league traces its roots to the Kansai Farm League, a formerly independent baseball league outside the realm of the NPB. It formerly included 7 teams, which quickly transformed into 6 due to the disbandment of once famous ballclub Sanyo Crowns. The first farm teams or second armies joined the league for the 1955 season. \nA league champion is determined at the end of each season. The Hanshin Tigers have won 18 Western League titles, the most in the league's history, followed by the Chunichi Dragons (16) and the SoftBank hawks (12).\nStructure and season.\nThe league is currently based on a round robin system with at most 33 games against each other team in the league, which allows second teams to play a maximum of 132 games per year, including interleague games with the Eastern League. The number of scheduled games will vary from team to team, and games that are cancelled will not be replaced. The league championship is thus decided on winning percentage.\nInterleague play.\nInterleague play exists. Interleague play is played in May during the Miyazaki Sunshine Series (宮崎サンシャインシリーズ). Plus, the WL champion meets the Eastern league's champion in the Farm Japan Championship Game, a single game to determine an overall champion of farm baseball, which has been held annually since 1987.\nHistory.\nKansai Farm League.\nThe league was created in 1952 as the Kansai Farm League, and was initially completely separate from the workings of the Nippon Professional Baseball. It featured the minor league teams of the six professional teams that had their homefields in the western region of Japan, as well one independent team not affiliated with an NPB franchise.\nThe initial complement of teams:\nThe Sanyo Crowns were dissolved after the 1952 season. The Shochiku Robins merged with the Taiyo Whales in 1953, but the Kintetsu Pearls' farm team joined the league that year, keeping the number of teams at six.\nIn 1954 the six teams of Nippon Professional Baseball's Central League decided to form their own minor league, called the New Japan League. With the Chunichi Dragons and Hanshin Tigers affiliates dropping out to join the new minor league, only four teams remained in the Kansai Farm League.\nFormation of the Western League.\nBoth minor league decided to join forces with NPB in 1955, and the 14 farm teams of the Central League and Pacific League were split up to create the Western League and Eastern League, each with seven teams.\n1955 Western League lineup (minor league homefield shown in parentheses):\nShrinkage.\nThe Lions moved their franchise to Saitama in 1979 to join the Eastern League, leaving six teams, and in 2005 the Orix BlueWave and Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes merged to become the Orix Buffaloes, leaving five teams in the Western League.\nFormat History.\nUntil 2002, teams played each other 18 times per year (9 home and 9 away) giving a 90-game season. In 2003 and 2004, the season was divided into two stages, with teams playing each other nine times in each stage. The two stage winners would then meet in a play-off game in October with the winners of the first stage hosting the game.\nIn 2005, the split-season system was abolished and teams played each other 22 times each (11 home, 11 away) giving an 88-game season. From 2011 to 2014, the number of games played has increased to 104 games (26 vs each opponent). From 2015, the number of games increased to a maximum of 132 per team with teams meeting up to 33 times per season.\nLeague rankings include all games played - including interleague games against teams in the Eastern League, played during the Miyazaki Sunshine Series in May - with winning percentage determining positions as teams play different numbers of games (cancelled games are not rescheduled). \nPrior to 2013 only games hosted by a team whose first team belongs to the Pacific League (Orix and SoftBank) included the designated hitter system (DH system). Since 2013 games hosted by Hanshin also used the DH system and Hiroshima followed suit in 2015. At present .\nIn principle, games can only run to 10 innings. However, in the case of a preliminary game held at the same venue as an official game of the first team, or in the case of a regional game held at a different venue the next day, extra innings are not played after two and a half or three hours (depending on the venue) from the start of the game. Even if the score is tied in the final inning or the home team wins the game after the top of the 9th inning, the bottom of the 9th will still be played. Even if time expires before the fifth inning is completed, the game shall always be played until the fifth inning.\nIn addition, a tournament has been held in May every year since 1961, in which all teams participate and the tournament is held at a neutral site (the 29th tournament in 1986 through the 40th tournament in 1997 were added to the official round-robin tournament).\nAlso, a few pro-am exchange tournaments are held during the season between teams that are not scheduled to play and teams from the Japan Baseball Federation."

        "title": "The Royal Ottawa Golf Club",
        "text": "The Royal Ottawa Golf Club is a premier private golf club located in Gatineau, Quebec, Canada. It was founded in 1891, and has made major contributions to the development of Canadian golf right from its early years, hosting many important championships and meetings, and continues to do so. Several significant champion golfers have been associated with the club. The club has 27 holes of golf.\nFounding, early years.\nThe club was founded in 1891, as the Ottawa Golf Club. It was the host of founding meetings of the Royal Canadian Golf Association (in June 1895), and the Canadian Professional Golfers' Association (in July 1911). Since 1895, it has hosted amateur and professional championship tournaments (see below).\nThe club's first site, a 9-hole course, was built on land lent by Charles Magee, a real-estate developer, in a section of Ottawa just west of the old Dominion Rifle Range (south of what became Strathcona Park) in what is now known as Sandy Hill. The first Canadian Amateur Championship was played on this course in June 1895. Soon after that, responding to pressure on prime real estate in the rapidly expanding city core, the club moved to a new site in the province of Quebec, just across the Ottawa River from Ottawa to the north, a mile north of Hull, Quebec, along Chelsea Road on the property that was one of the founder of Hull, Quebec, Philemon Wright's original farms, the Columbia Farm. The clubhouse occupied the stone house that was built by Thomas Brigham, Philemon's son-in-law. This course consisted of 12 holes, of which 6 had to be played twice to comprise an 18-hole round. One of the par three holes was quite unique, in that players had to flight their ball over the barn behind the clubhouse to reach the green.\nMoves to current site.\nIn the early 1900s, the club purchased its current site in Aylmer, Quebec (now part of the city of Gatineau). The site had been known as Mrs. McVeity's orchard and coincidentally, it occupied land that was another of Philemon Wright's original farms, the Britannia Farm. Mrs. McVeity, who was nicknamed \"Mrs. Slinn\", was once vice-president of Slinn's Bakery in Ottawa.\nThe Ottawa Golf Club built a new course, and constructed a clubhouse, which opened in 1904. Five years later, it burned to the ground. Its replacement was built on the same site, and it burned down in 1930. The present clubhouse was officially opened on September 19, 1931.\nIn 1912, the club received permission from King George V to use the designation 'Royal'.\nThe club presently has an 18-hole course and a 9-hole course, known as the Royal Nine. The main course was designed by Tom Bendelow in a parkland style, and among its features are back-to-back par 3s (holes 11 and 12). The course was redesigned a few years later by Scottish architect Willie Park Jr. (twice Open Championship winner). The course has been modified in minor ways many times in the years since. Royal Ottawa is affiliated with the Quebec Golf Association and the RCGA.\nSignificant championships hosted.\nThe club hosted the first Canadian Amateur Championship in 1895, and has hosted this championship eight more times (in 1899, 1906, 1911, 1914, 1925, 1951, 1991, 2016). The club hosted the Canadian Open in 1906 and 1911. It hosted the 2000 CN Canadian Women's Open (known at the time as the duMaurier Championship); this major championship was won by Meg Mallon.\nChampions associated with Royal Ottawa.\nThe winner of the first Canadian Open, in 1904, was Jack Oke, one of the club's early professionals. Karl Keffer, Canadian Open champion in 1909 and 1914, served as head professional for many years. Davie Black was a professional at the club in the early 20th century, and a founding member of the CPGA, before moving to Vancouver, B.C. to take a new job, and his son, Ken Black, who learned his golf at Royal Ottawa, won the 1936 Vancouver Jubilee tournament (as an amateur, becoming the first Canadian to win a PGA Tour event) and the 1939 Canadian Amateur Championship. Alexa Stirling Fraser, an American who married Ottawa doctor W.G. Fraser, had been a young golf prodigy and three-time U.S. Women's Amateur champion from Atlanta, Georgia, before settling in Ottawa and joining the club; she won two Canadian Ladies Amateur Championship titles, contended several more times, and won a record nine Royal Ottawa Ladies' Club Championships. Eric Kaufmanis of Ottawa holds the course record, with a round of 9-under-par 62, scored in 1979. Karl Keffer, David Black, Ken Black, and Alexa Stirling Fraser are all members of the Canadian Golf Hall of Fame."

The top 16 seeds for ranking events were automatically invited, while the other players entered a qualifying tournament for the right to one of three wild-card places.

        "text": "The West Indian cricket team toured England from 13 May to 3 September 1995 as part of the 1995 English cricket season. The tour included six Tests and three One Day Internationals. The Test series was drawn 2–2 while the ODI series finished 2–1 to England. The first ODI match of the series was the 1,000th ODI to be played.\nThis was Ray Illingworth's first series in charge as England Team Manager as well as Chairman of Selectors, having sacked Keith Fletcher earlier in the year after the Ashes defeat.\nOverview.\nBoth sides came into this series with the Australians as their most recent opponents. England's 3–1 defeat in the Ashes series in Australia was considered a real disappointment, and ultimately led to the dismissal of Team Manager Keith Fletcher. Long-serving former captains Graham Gooch and Mike Gatting retired from international cricket after the tour, having had disappointing campaigns.\nThe West Indians' home defeat by the Australians was a more closely fought affair, with Brian Lara (308 runs at 44) Curtly Ambrose (20 wickets at 21.55) and Courtney Walsh (13 at 19.84) all performing strongly against a touring team shorn of the injured Craig McDermott, but with strong back-up in the form of Glenn McGrath and Paul Reiffel. The defeat became a symbolic point in the exchange of power between the two sides, ending the West Indies' dominance and signalling Australia overtaking them as the leading cricketing nation.\nAt this point, England had not won a series against the Windies since 1969.\nFor England, Mike Atherton was retained as captain, though his appointment was only confirmed on the eve of the season, and the One Day International series saw debuts for Lancashire's Peter Martin and Kent's Alan Wells, while the West Indies blooded Ottis Gibson, a fiery all-rounder from Barbados. The early part of the tour was hampered by the weather, with the first ODI going into the reserve day.\nWest Indian concerns at the start of the summer surrounded the form of captain Richie Richardson, who began the tour with a run of low scores, and a series of injuries to bowlers' backs, allegedly a result of sleeping on soft beds.\nOne Day Internationals (ODIs).\nEngland won the Texaco Trophy 2–1.\nTest series – The Wisden Trophy.\n1st Test.\nThe first Test saw the home side opt for five specialist bowlers, but there was no place for Angus Fraser despite his performances down-under in the winter. Instead a début was handed to Peter Martin, who had impressed with a four-wicket haul on his ODI debut, and Devon Malcolm was included on the basis of his extra pace. The West Indians selected their customary battery of four pacemen, Ian Bishop and Kenny Benjamin backing up spearheads Walsh and Ambrose.\nRichardson won the toss and invited England to bat, and the main feature of the day was the intermittent rain, which saw the players on and off the field at various intervals all day. Amidst the rain, Atherton and Robin Smith added 52 for the first wicket before Benjamin struck with a ball that moved back in, and the edge carried to the visitors' captain at third slip. Graeme Hick could only add 18 to the score either side of lunch, and although Graham Thorpe provided support to Atherton(81), the captain's dismissal off the last ball of the first day saw England 148/4, needing to solidify to get a defendable score. This wasn't to be, as Bishop (5–32) and Benjamin (4–60) ripped through the middle and lower order in just over an hour on the second morning, and although Hooper fell to Malcolm's first ball in the reply, Sherwin Campbell and Brian Lara took the score to 95/2 at a real canter, Lara's 53 (10 fours) coming from just 55 balls before Richard Illingworth tempted him into coming down the wicket and his attempted drive was nicked to Hick at slip.\nCampbell (69) and Jimmy Adams (58) continued the strokeplay, and Arthurton joined them to take the West Indies into a first innings lead, but before the close Adams mistimed a sweep off Hick for Martin to take a good catch and the latter continued Richardson's batting torments, trapping him leg before without scoring. The lower order put in some good efforts, but a collapse from 216/3 to 282 all out was disappointing, and it was left to the bowlers to repeat their first innings performance. Of the England batsmen only Thorpe (61) really found his feet, though he was as lucky as anyone – a mis-timed pull bounced back off the bottom of the stumps without disturbing the bails, and he survived again on the third evening when he was dropped at slip by Keith Arthurton. Despite a moderate wag from the tail that extended the innings from 136/6 to 208, it was still well short of par, and Walsh (4–60) and Ambrose (3–44) deserved the rewards of their efforts, coming out firing. Martin picked up Campbell early in the run chase, but Hooper (73* in 72 deliveries) and Lara (48 in 40) knocked off the 126 required without any further alarm.\n2nd Test.\n \nThe second Test at Lord's proved to be a closer contest. Fraser was recalled to the side in place of Malcolm and Phillip DeFreitas was dropped for the umpteenth time to make way for debutant Dominic Cork. For the West Indies, Ottis Gibson made his Test debut and Benjamin missed out.\nAtherton won the toss and elected to bat first, and although the West Indian bowlers made inroads either side of lunch it looked the right decision with Robin Smith (61) and Graham Thorpe (52) taking the score up to 185/3 just after the tea interval. The game then changed around – Smith and Mark Ramprakash were both deceived by Carl Hooper's off-spin and Thorpe and Darren Gough followed soon after, leaving the tail with some work. Cork and Martin added 50 for the eighth wicket, but England were disappointed with a total of 283 all out.\nGough and Fraser struck early in the West Indian first innings to leave the tourists 23/2, but Hooper (40), Jimmy Adams (54), Richardson (49) and Keith Arthurton (75) made significant contributions to a first innings lead of 41. Fraser was easily the pick of the England bowlers, sending down 33 overs during the innings and finishing with deserved figures of 5/66. The home side might have done even better had they held their catches – Arthurton was reprieved when still in single figures.\nThe second innings saw a superb partnership of 98 from Hick and Smith that solidified a slightly dodgy start that saw Walsh strike under gloomy grey skies. Atherton and Stewart had both been caught down the leg side by Junior Murray, and although Hick took the attack to the tall Jamaican, he had already send Thorpe to the ambulance first ball with a beamer that crashed into the side of his helmet. Hick (67) eventually succumbed to Bishop from around the wicket before bad light called a halt to proceedings on the third day, and Ramprakash was dispatched by the same bowler the next morning, which brought Thorpe back to the crease showing no ill effects from his overnight stay at St Mary's. Both men batted with confidence on a seaming pitch, and added 85 before Thorpe (42) was caught at gully by Richardson off Ambrose. Smith continued his fine form, adding a further 50 with Cork and 30 with Gough, but his dismissal for 90 (11 fours) saw the start of the collapse, and England fell from 320/6 to 336 all out.\nBy the close, Gough had picked up Hooper's wicket and the visitors needed a further 228 to win on the last day. They had moved on to 99 when Lara fell for 54, taken superbly in front of slip by a diving Stewart to set the ball rolling. Sherwin Campbell played an outstanding innings of 93 to keep the West Indians in the game for a long time, but the tourists were undone at the other end. Cork settled into a good rhythm and kept probing away with both natural away-swing and newly developed inswinger. Adams, Richardson and Arthurton disappeared in quick succession around the lunch break to make the crucial inroads into the middle order. Murray and the tail hung around tenaciously, each taking up valuable time, but after Campbell played uncharacteristically across the line and edged to Stewart, Ambrose and Walsh were quickly dismissed by the debutant, whose figures of 7/43 were well supported by Gough (3/79) and the workhorse Fraser.\nThe West Indies finished some 73 runs short of their target as England levelled the series, but this was a game that England won, rather than one that the visitors threw away.\n3rd Test.\nThe third Test at Edgbaston was dominated by the West Indies bowlers who took turns in dismissing the English batsmen, bowling them for 147 in the 1st innings and 89 in the 2nd innings and won by an innings and 64 runs despite setting a mediocre score of 300 and took a 2–1 lead into the fourth Test.\n4th Test.\nThe fourth Test at Old Trafford was controlled by England where they developed a 221 run lead after the 1st innings. West Indies were bowled out for 314 runs and England won by 6 wickets after chasing a score of just 94. On day 4 of this Test Dominic Cork got a hat-trick by dismissing Richie Richardson (bowled), Junior Murray (lbw) and Carl Hooper (lbw). This was also the occasion where Cork, while batting in England's 1st innings, brushed his stumps with his foot and dislodged a bail. However, there was no appeal from the West Indies, so he replaced the bail and carried on batting.\n6th Test.\nThe West Indies score of 692/8 declared is still the highest Test innings that did not feature an individual double-century scored by a batsman."

        "text": "The West Indian cricket team in England in 1991 played three one day internationals and five Tests, under the captaincy of Viv Richards, as part of an extensive tour in which they also played first-class matches against 11 first-class county teams, the combined Minor Counties, the Combined Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and a World XI to finish, plus 55-over one-day matches against one more first-class county (Gloucestershire) and the Duchess of Norfolk's Invitation XI. Of the non-international matches, West Indies defeated Kent, Middlesex and Leicestershire in the longer matches, and Gloucestershire over 55 overs, and lost only the opening match against the Duchess of Norfolk's XI: all the other matches were drawn, although some were close to a finish. England, by contrast with the previous disastrous tour of 1988, were a far more settled side, and gave a far better account of themselves under the captaincy of Graham Gooch.\nThe ODI series was won 3-0 by England: the Test series was drawn 2-2.\nWest Indian squad.\nThe West Indies of 1988 had been thought to be quite a mixture, of aging batsmen with only Hooper as a real newcomer, and younger bowlers with only Marshall as a veteran. The basic core of the squad was almost the same, three years later: Gordon Greenidge promising that this time really would be his final tour, as did Viv Richards and wicketkeeper Jeff Dujon, while Desmond Haynes was also aging but would hang around a few years yet, Gus Logie had the intention to do likewise, Richie Richardson had matured into one of the best batsmen in the world - throughout the tour he fought with England's Gooch and Smith over this designation, the actual ranking changing hands several times - and Carl Hooper also now sure of his place. Phil Simmons, the reserve opening batsman who had suffered a serious head injury in a county match three years before, was hoping to get a chance most likely in the county or one-day matches, and Brian Lara, the only left-hander in the squad, was already being talked about as the next big thing in West Indian batting. Reserve wicketkeeper David Williams was there mainly to be tried out in the county matches, with a view to taking over after Dujon's retirement. For the bowlers, Malcolm Marshall was already planning to join Richards, Greenidge and Dujon in retirement after the tour, but Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh, both fairly new in 1988, were now seasoned regulars with many more years in the side ahead of them. But after those three, the picture was less clear. Pat Patterson, fast but erratic, had never quite cemented a place in the team: but Winston Benjamin, often his rival for the last position, had been left behind. Instead, the last three places had gone to Ian Bishop, brilliant but as it turned out injury-prone (he was forced to pull out of the tour before it set off), and to two rookies, Ian Allen and Hamish Anthony - both fairly unproven even at first-class level. There had been some talk of giving a place to Ezra Moseley, who had played when England toured the West Indies in 1989-90; if Moseley, as one of the rebel tourists of South Africa in the early 1980s, could be forgiven, then a case could have been made to invite another such rebel tourist, Franklyn Stephenson. Stephenson was now regularly producing brilliance with both bat and ball for Nottinghamshire, but the selectors decided that both were aging, and opted for youth. They also did not select a specialist spin bowler in the squad, deciding that Hooper and the aging Richards would be most likely all the spin bowling they would need.\nEngland players.\nEngland had, if not a fully settled team, then at least a much more solid nucleus of regulars since the 1988 series. Graham Gooch, although nearly 40, was captain, opening batsman, and in the form of his life: having only the previous year scored 333 against India. His long search for a reliable opening partner seemed to have been ended by the emergence of Michael Atherton, who had made the position his own over the previous year with centuries against New Zealand, India and Australia. In the middle order, Allan Lamb was still highly regarded as a fine player of fast bowling, and his record against the West Indies ensured him a place in the team at the start of the summer: while Robin Smith, the only one of many debutants in the disastrous 1988 series to emerge with credit, was utterly fearless against fast bowling, and already recognised as world-class. Internal squabbles - and a belief that, despite having a better average than many of his competitors, he was still definitely aging (although younger than Gooch) - kept David Gower out of the side: but at the younger end of the scale, two highly regarded newcomers were coming through. Graeme Hick, Zimbabwean-born and having gone through a long residency qualification, had not only been breaking records all over the place in county cricket, but had thumped a magnificent 172* off the full West Indian attack for Worcestershire the only time he had faced them in 1988, was now qualified for England, and was rushed into the side: and not far behind his county record, came Mark Ramprakash of Middlesex. In the one-day matches they would be joined by Neil Fairbrother, regarded as a brilliant specialist in the shorter format but not quite technically sound enough for Tests. Jack Russell, equally eccentric in manners and mannerisms both on and off the pitch, was widely thought of as one of the best wicket-keepers in the world, as well as being a more than handy nuisance with the bat: an alternative wicketkeeper was Alec Stewart, not as fine a keeper but a good enough batsman to be selected for that alone. For bowling, the picture was considerably less clear: especially because Angus Fraser, far and away England's best bowler of the past two years, had broken down injured on the winter tour of Australia, and would miss the series (and indeed the next two years). Devon Malcolm, as fast a bowler as any of the West Indians but not always reliably accurate - perhaps best compared to Patterson - had mostly cemented a place in the team, although he was being pushed hard for it by the bulky David Lawrence of Gloucestershire - both being regarded as sufficiently risky that there was not room for both in the team. England, unlike West Indies, would at least consider selecting a specialist spin bowler, and the choice was between two slow left-armers: Phil Tufnell who had bowled well in his debut series but had severe off-pitch disciplinary issues, and moreover was a hopeless batsman and fielder, or Richard Illingworth, who spun the ball less but was more accurate on the pitch and reliable off it, and moreover was a fine enough lower-order batsman to have scored first-class centuries. The lively fast-medium swing of Phil DeFreitas had made him a first choice pick in English conditions: Chris Lewis was of similar repute, but untried, as a bowler with pretensions to batting, while the military-medium of Derek Pringle had slowed down recently but become more accurate, and Steve Watkin of Glamorgan had been taking wickets by the hatful in county cricket. The trouble was, as usual, deciding which of them deserved a place above the others, all being good but few having made a truly compelling claim to a permanent position. And waiting in the wings was that old warhorse of an all-rounder Ian Botham, now portly, aging and far slower than he had been, out of the team for two years, but still wanting one last crack at the only team he had never really done himself justice against.\nRecent form.\nAfter the disasters of the 1988 and 1989 home series against West Indies and Australia, and the loss of a squad of players to the rebel 1989 tour of South Africa, England had rebuilt under Gooch. The 1989-90 tour of the West Indies had surprised everybody, because England won the first match, and were denied a 2-0 lead only by poor light and flagrant time-wasting in the Third Test, before two heavy West Indian victories in the last two matches turned the series around (and even in the first of those, they left it late, a draw having looked odds-on before a brilliant spell by Ambrose in the final session.) England's home summer of 1990 had seen 1-0 victories over India and New Zealand, with Gooch's own batting being particularly magnificent, and Atherton's emergence not far behind. Fraser and Malcolm had been stars with the ball. Sadly the 1990-1 Ashes tour of Australia had seen a significant reversal of fortune, with Fraser lost to injury, Malcolm losing his accuracy when asked to bowl long spells in an attack that was one man light, regular middle-order batting collapses undoing good starts, Gower (despite two centuries) and the promising John Morris jettisoned for off-pitch issues: and even the promising start of Tufnell in which his bowling nearly won the 3rd Test at Sydney was undone by disciplinary shortcomings. But still, England expected a better showing back at home. And in one-day matches, they were heavy favourites to beat the Windies, whose form in ODIs had not matched their Test form for several years now: while England had been capable of beating any team in ODIs even when their Test team was falling apart, and were among the favourites for the next winter's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.\nWest Indies, meanwhile, had some creaking at the seams. After the surprisingly narrow victory over England in 1989-90, they had toured Pakistan and finished with their third successive 1-1 series draw against those opponents, followed by a 2-1 home victory over Australia in the months after the Ashes series. But some players had trouble with form, others with fitness, others with discipline: Gordon Greenidge, already saying that the England tour would be his last, almost didn't make the tour, a long spell of poor form with the bat resulting in talk of dropping him, but he saved his place with a double-century in the second innings of the 4th Test against Australia. Ian Bishop, just on the point of making the fourth fast-bowling position his own, broke down injured, missed the Australian series, worked hard to get himself fit for the England tour but broke down injured again: and there were even suggestions that Richards himself was playing more on his past than his present. And while Lara with the bat, and Bishop with the ball - if he could keep fit - were undeniably the class of the next generation, and there were other fine batsmen who had to be left behind, the cupboard was beginning to look a little threadbare for other replacements with the ball and particularly with the keeper's gloves. Nevertheless, West Indies *had* beaten Australia, who had beaten England, so they had some reason to be confident, and they at least were more settled in the choice of their first team than England.\nODI series.\n1st ODI.\nThe ODI series began, in the first match at Edgbaston, with England handing a recall to the aging Ian Botham - a reward for a magnificent 161* against them for Worcestershire in the county match. Hick made his debut, and Fairbrother a recall, with the bat. For the West Indies, Haynes was injured and missed the entire ODI series, Greenidge opening with Simmons. The latter was dismissed quickly: and when Botham came on to bowl, he wrecked the West Indies' batting with his best bowling figures in ODIs of 4/45 including the wicket of Richardson in his first over. DeFreitas, Lewis, Pringle, Illingworth (on debut) and even Gooch backed him up superbly with the ball, Richards was the only man to reach 30, and it took some unlikely slogging from Walsh and Ambrose to raise a semi-respectable total of 173/8. In response, England looked set fair at 80/2 despite poor weather and bad light causing frequent delays, but Lamb and Fairbrother fell unexpectedly to Hooper before play was abandoned for the night, the match spilling into a second day. On that second day, Atherton played a lone hand with the bat for a magnificent 69*, as Botham tore a hamstring (he would miss the remaining ODIs and the first two Tests with this), unwisely carried on but was dismissed next ball, and wickets fell in a procession at the other end till Atherton was left with last man Illingworth and 20 runs still to get. But Windies' bowling strategy betrayed them: as usual, they had selected four specialist bowlers for 11 overs each, and looked to have part-timers make up the remaining 11 overs. And the specialist bowlers threw everything they could at Atherton and Illingworth, but could not break through, and with 48 overs gone, the four specialists had bowled their maximum 44 and Richards had to turn to his part-timers to finish. Shortly afterwards, Illingworth hit the winning boundary and showed the value of a no. 11 batsman who had scored first class centuries.\n2nd ODI.\nIn the second match at Old Trafford, the injured Botham was replaced by Mark Ramprakash, for his debut: with Gooch taking Botham's place with an 11-over spell with the ball. Ramprakash was expected to strengthen the batting, but however had little chance to bat, coming in only in the last couple of overs, as Gooch, Atherton and Lamb all scored fifties in England's 270/4, Lamb's being the fastest. West Indies fell nine runs short: many of their batsmen getting in, but only two, Hooper (48) and Richards (78) passing 30. All England's bowlers contributed: only Illingworth missed out on a wicket, but was the most economical. Greenidge had sustained an injury after the match began, but before West Indies batted: he came in at number 8 but failed to achieve anything in what would be his last ever international match, Dujon joining Simmons as makeshift opener.\n3rd ODI.\nWest Indies fared better with the bat in the third match at Lord's - only the makeshift Simmons/Dujon opening partnership failed outright, Lara coming in during the middle order to replace Greenidge. Logie, however, was the batting hero with 82. England, meanwhile, rested Lamb and dropped Lewis, bringing in all-rounder Dermot Reeve and fast bowler David Lawrence. The latter, true to his reputation and previous form, was expensive (67 runs) but took four wickets as Windies reached 264/9. In response, England won at a canter despite the early dismissals of Gooch and Atherton, as Fairbrother (113) and Hick (86*) knocked off the runs almost without breaking a sweat, with nearly ten overs to spare. Once again Ramprakash managed to get onto the field but only for a few minutes, not even facing one ball this time as Hick smashed the winning runs.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nIn the early season, up at Headingley in Yorkshire, with plenty of rain and overcast conditions forecast, it was to nobody's surprise that neither side selected a spinner. England gave Test debuts to Hick and Ramprakash: dropping Fairbrother, who had been pigeonholed as an ODI player, made room for the return of Robin Smith who had missed the ODI series. Devon Malcolm returned to the bowling attack, joining Pringle and DeFreitas, and a debut was also handed to Steve Watkin, it being thought that the conditions would suit the tall seam-up Glamorgan bowler (and he was the closest like-for-like replacement for Fraser, for whom this pitch could have been tailor-made had he not been out with his long-term injury.) For Windies, Haynes was fit to return as opener, while Greenidge's injury forced him to return home, Simmons taking over permanently as Haynes's opening partner. The rest of the team largely picked itself, with the only doubt being whether the young and promising Lara would get a chance at the expense of Logie: but the latter had long since established his credentials in English conditions.\nOn a pitch and weather conditions clearly favouring the bowlers, with multiple interruptions forecast (correctly) over all five days, England won the toss and batted first - reasoning that, awkward though things seemed, they would likely get worse rather than better. Atherton, Hick and Lamb all fell early: Gooch was soon to join them, though having shown more aggression, he had scored over 30. Ramprakash, on debut, hung around obdurately for 27, while Smith put together a fine half-century to rescue England from a precarious position before being narrowly run-out for 54. Some late resistance from Pringle and DeFreitas saw England reach 174/7 at the close, and 198 all out on the second day: a total which looked very small when Simmons took off like a tornado, clouting boundaries off both Malcolm and Watkin. The latter, however, got rid of a strangely out-of-sorts Haynes, and then DeFreitas and Pringle came on and brought the scoring rate down. Ramprakash pulled off a spectacular catch in the gully to get rid of Simmons, then an equally spectacular run-out to dismiss Hooper: Richardson was also run out, unwisely going for a third: and thereafter only Richards offered any resistance with a quickfire 73 as Windies collapsed to 166/8 at the end of an interrupted second day. They closed at 173 all out on day 3, giving England a slender first-innings lead - one which looked insignificant when England lost their first three wickets even faster than they had on the first day. Gooch and Ramprakash (27) steadied the ship with a fine partnership of 78, but then the next three wickets - Ramprakash, Smith (first ball) and Russell fell for only eight more runs, all six wickets having fallen to Ambrose. England finished the third day on a precarious 143/6.\nThe fourth day, although the most shortened of all by rain, was the crucial day of the match. At one end were England's tail-enders, desperately clinging on for their lives: at the other end was Gooch, sublimely biffing the bowling around as if it was a sunny late August day at The Oval rather than a rainy early June at Headingley. Pringle, the other not-out overnight batsmen, could hardly get a run but managed to hang in there for ages - of the 98-run partnership, his share was 27, matching Ramprakash for second top score (no other batsman got more than 6). After Pringle finally fell, the last three hung around long enough for Gooch to add 30 more to the score: when England were all out for 252, Gooch had carried his bat for a magnificent 154 not out - rated as one of the finest innings of all time both for the quality of the bowling, the state of the weather and pitch, the context of the match at the time, and the comparison to how the other batsmen in the innings had fared, Gooch's share being among the highest percentage shares by a single batsman of a completed innings. There was just time for West Indies to bat a couple of overs before the close: and they began disastrously, Simmons chopping his first ball straight on to his stumps.\nThe final day dawned with West Indies needing 267 more runs to win, or, more realistically, rain to save a draw in those conditions. Haynes and Richardson started promisingly, but after the former fell to Pringle, Watkin took out the middle order with three wickets in three overs, and only Dujon's 33 joined Richardson's 68 in offering further resistance. Halfway through the afternoon session, Walsh skied a delivery from Malcolm, Atherton took a running catch, and England were 1-0 up in the series. Gooch's 154* made him obvious man of the match: DeFreitas, with four wickets in each innings, was pick of the bowlers.\n2nd Test.\nEngland were unchanged for the Second Test at Lords, and only one change was made by the Windies: Patterson having sustained an injury, West Indies replaced him with debutant Ian Allen. It was clear that the Windies had been severely rattled by their defeat in the opening match, and were up for a fight: and they certainly showed it. Meanwhile, the very differing conditions at Lords suggested that England would have done better to drop one of their medium pacers for a spinner, although the argument of keeping a winning team together was raised. West Indies came out of the blocks like a train, bashing their way to 317/3 on the first day with Haynes, Richardson, Hooper and Richards all passing 50: England's only bright spot being an unexpected bonus from the occasional off-spin of Hick, dismissing Simmons in his first over right on the stroke of lunch, and Richardson near the end of the second session. After a start like that, things could only get better for England, and they did: although Hooper reached his century, nobody else offered much resistance to Pringle's five-for on the second day, and England felt they had been handed a lifeline by restricting the Windies to \"only\" 419 by lunch.\nThis was put very much in perspective only a few overs later, when Atherton, Hick and Lamb all failed again, leaving England at 16 for 3. Once again Ramprakash ground his way to the mid-twenties but failed to go further: and when Gooch was deceived by Walsh, offering no stroke to a delivery which seamed up the famous Lord's slope and took out his off stump, England were a disastrous 84/5. The Windies bowlers had their tails very much up, and threw everything they had at Smith and Russell: both struggled at first, but both hung on, to reach 110/5 by the end of the second day, barely half the way towards the follow-on target. The third day of the match saw Smith produce a heroic innings - particularly featuring his already-famous square cuts - to almost match Gooch's Headingley effort: again with obdurate support from the tail, who succeeded where the top order had failed. Russell continued to make 46, Pringle 35, DeFreitas 29, even Watkin hung around for ages for his 6, and when Malcolm finally fell, Smith was left on 148* and England's total of 354 was much closer to the Windies' first innings than anyone had had any right to expect. When West Indies in turn crashed to 12 for 2, now just 77 runs ahead, the position was pretty much level with all to play for, but the last two days of the match were washed out by persistent rain and the game finished as a draw. To nobody's surprise, Smith was named Man of the Match.\n3rd Test.\nWest Indies were unchanged for the Third Test, at Trent Bridge. England made two changes: the first was to replace Malcolm, who had misfired erratically in both previous tests, with Lawrence - also fast and sometimes erratic, but he had at least taken wickets in the ODI. The other was to drop Watkin, who had been spanked all over Lord's, by selecting the first specialist spinner of the series: and, thanks partly to his being seen as more reliable - and the fact that the West Indies had a reputation for being more vulnerable to the ball turning away than turning in, which had been previously exploited by such as Qadir, Hirwani and even Border - the spot was given to Richard Illingworth. They had also considered recalling Botham, fit again after his torn hamstring in the first ODI, but it was not clear who was to be left out to replace him: in any event he saved them the bother by getting injured again and being unavailable for both this match and the next.\nEngland batted first: and this time their top three did not let them down. Hick with 43 made his best score of the series, Atherton's 32 was at least adequate, and both Gooch and Smith passed 60. Lamb, unfortunately, failed again, as did Ramprakash for once, and the tail were unable to repeat their heroics of previous matches, England closing at a round 300 with five wickets to Ambrose. In response, once again West Indies were batting right on the stroke of lunch: once again the ball was thrown to a spinner for the last over before lunch: and once again Simmons was the victim of a spinner's first over, in fact Illingworth's very first delivery in Tests. Lawrence and DeFreitas also took wickets, West Indies were 118/4, and England were looking optimistically at the chance of a lead. However Richards and Logie batted superbly, scoring 80 and 87 respectively: both fell before the England score was overtaken, but Marshall also got in on the act, spanking a quickfire 67 from number eight in the order. The rest of the Windies tail supported him, and England's dreams of a lead faced instead the reality of a deficit of 97.\nThis seemed to knock the morale right out of England - all their batting collapsed at once, to 115/8. Lamb made his own highest score of the series: unfortunately it was only 29, and even more unfortunately, no other Englishman was able to match it - at least, not until some unexpected late-order slogging from DeFreitas (55), obduracy from Illingworth (13) and more slogging from Lawrence (34). A score of 211 and target of 115 was never going to be enough, and although Lawrence dismissed the hapless Simmons with his first ball, he was hit all around the ground by Haynes and Richardson who knocked off the runs with no further loss. Ambrose, with eight wickets in the match, was named Man of the Match.\n4th Test.\nIf the Third Test had seen England crash from a promising start, the Fourth saw an awful start, a couple of attempts to retrieve the situation, only to crash again. Smith, who had been batting at six, had sustained an injury in between the Third and Fourth tests: England's response was to drop Atherton down a place in the order - he had looked uncharacteristically fragile this series - also moving Hick, Lamb and Ramprakash down a place, and bring in Glamorgan's opener Hugh Morris for a Test debut (had Smith been fit, Morris would still have played, Lamb would have been dropped instead.) Lawrence was dropped to 12th man to make a place for Chris Lewis, another tall fast bowler with pretensions to all-rounder status. For West Indies, they were able to reverse the change they had been forced into at Lords, Patterson being fit again, and returning to replace Allen. England crashed to 188 all out: only Gooch (45) and Ramprakash (29, his own highest score) passing 20. West Indies, in return, passed England's score with only three wickets down, and reached 253/4 by the end of the second day, the pick of the batsmen being Richardson with a fine century. Even more worryingly, DeFreitas - pick of England's bowlers so far in the series - sustained an injury halfway through an over, was unable to complete it, and limped off.\nChris Lewis tried to inspire a fightback: both overnight batsmen fell quickly to his bowling the next morning, as did the rest of the West Indies, Lewis finishing with six wickets, West Indies on 292. But England, in turn, were wrecked by the returning Patterson, bowling as fast as he had ever bowled, and for once adding gun-barrel accuracy to his pace. England were smashed to 5/3, then 94/5 (Gooch out for 40) and finally 145/8. For a second time Lewis, coming in at number 10, attempted a one-man fightback, smashing his way to 65: and again, as he had done so often this series, Pringle was able to hold out obdurately at the other end when he had someone to support, and made 45. These last two plus Illingworth between them added over a hundred to the score, turning a walkover target into a potentially tricky 152 on a pitch which was becoming itself increasingly tricky: then DeFreitas, bowling despite his injury, blew away three West Indians for 24 runs, and it was game on. Sadly he could not bowl at both ends, nor for long as the earlier injury continued to bother him: Pringle's earlier accuracy in the series deserted him, Lewis was unable to replicate his own first-innings heroics, and Illingworth's consistency also left him, Hooper and Richards finishing the job without further loss. Richards rubbed salt into the wound, finishing the match by belting Illingworth for six when only one run was needed, while Richardson's first innings century gave him the match award.\n5th Test.\nBoth sides had to make changes for the 5th test. Logie - whom some said was lucky to have been playing anyway - had sustained an injury towards the end of the 4th test. Unfortunately for the West Indies, Brian Lara - the reserve batsman in the squad - had also been injured shortly before the match. As a consequence, their replacement batsman was the unlikely figure of Clayton Lambert, who had not even been in the initial squad, but had been belatedly called up after Logie's injury simply because he was playing professional league cricket in England at the time and had made an ODI debut a couple of years previously. England made more changes, not just in personnel but in formation since they decided to play five specialist bowlers, owing to the need to bowl Windies out twice if they were to win the match and draw the series. Morris was retained, despite his double failure on debut, but Lamb and Hick both belatedly paid the price for their poor form in the series and were axed for Smith's return - Smith being promoted up the order. Jack Russell, too, was dropped - while his wicket keeping had been excellent, he had produced only one innings of substance with the bat, so for the first time (and, indeed, not the last) he was dropped in favour of an inferior keeper but superior batsman, Alec Stewart, who unlike Russell could bat in the top six. Botham finally returned to make an appearance in the Test series, as all-rounder batting at seven: Lawrence was recalled because it was felt that the faster pitch at The Oval might suit him: Tufnell replaced Illingworth in the spinner's position, since he was thought to be more attacking and mercurial than Illingworth, whose more containing role had proved somewhat anodyne. DeFreitas, Lewis and Pringle were fighting for two places between them: at first it was thought DeFreitas would miss out thanks to his injury at Edgbaston, but he had been England's most consistent bowler all series, and he made a full recovery - Pringle sustaining an injury himself and sparing the selectors the awkward choice between dropping him or Lewis.\nEngland won the toss and batted. Gooch, as usual, got England off to a good start, and Morris managed to stay with him as England put on the only century opening partnership of the series. Both batsmen fell at once, quickly followed by Atherton, but Smith steadied the ship with his second century of the series. Ramprakash, Stewart, Botham and Lewis all put on decent scores in support - although Botham was dismissed in bizarre fashion, when he attempted to hook a short delivery from Ambrose, missed, was hit on the helmet, spun around, toppled towards his stumps, tried to hurdle them and didn't quite make it, to be out hit-wicket, sparking a famous commentary-box giggling fit between Brian Johnston and Jonathan Agnew involving the immortal phrase \"he didn't quite manage to get his leg over\". Even Lawrence got in on the act, hitting a boundary that somehow went straight over Dujon's head behind the stumps: England finished on 419, matching the Windies' effort at Lords as the highest team total of the series. Viv Richards, in the field, was meanwhile forced to leave the pitch twice for treatment - the first time owing to a bee sting, the second time for a migraine.\nWest Indies began solidly, despite the now-customary early dismissal of Simmons. Botham almost repeated his own now-customary trick of taking a wicket in the first over of a comeback, but the catch offered by Desmond Haynes was dropped at slip. He could not be kept down for long, though, and removed the dangerous Richardson early on the third morning. West Indies' lucky debutant, Lambert, came in at five, and breezily bashed the ball around for 39 off 49 deliveries, West Indies seeming set for a solid response at 158/3. Then everything changed as Tufnell came on to bowl: Lambert, with an almighty slog that would probably have gone straight into the nearby gasometer or possibly over it had he connected properly, instead whacked the ball almost straight up in the air. Ramprakash was waiting when it came out of orbit: 158/4. The remaining wickets collapsed in a heap, mostly to the delighted Tufnell, most of them off wild, eyes-off-the-ball slogs, leaving the astonished Haynes carrying his bat for 75 not out at the other end. At 176 all-out, England had no hesitation in asking the West Indies to follow on, 243 behind.\nWindies batted much more responsibly second time around, to their credit. Botham took the first two wickets (Simmons and the promoted Lambert), Lawrence disposed of Haynes, but was thereafter somewhat wayward, and was well punished by Richardson, Hooper and Richards for his pains. So too was Tufnell, on whom Hooper was particularly severe: although Tufnell had the last laugh in that particular contest when Hooper hit him straight at Gooch to be out for 54. But he was far more expensive in this innings - his previous 6/25 having to contrast with 1/150 this time round. Richards, needing 20 to preserve a career batting average of 50 at his retirement, made 60, and received three standing ovations - one when he got to 21, another for his fifty, and the biggest of all as he left the ground for the last time, dismissed by Lawrence. Dujon also fell cheaply to Lawrence for the second time in the match - with the assistance of a distraction from an annoyingly persistent pigeon, which refused to leave the playing surface - and West Indies finished day 4 on 356/6, Richardson having scored a century and Marshall, potentially dangerous, on 17. However Marshall went in the first over next morning: Lawrence and DeFreitas polished off the tail - Lawrence finally getting his revenge on Richardson too, and finishing with his first international five-wicket haul, one which confirmed all that was already known about him, that he was wayward and sometimes expensive but had the knack of dismissing good batsmen.\nThe Windies' final total of 385 left England chasing a comparatively innocuous-looking 143 to chase, on the best batting pitch of the series. It looked easy, but of course the West Indies had other ideas: Morris and Atherton both fell quite cheaply, Gooch and Smith steadied the ship but fell for 29 and 26 respectively, and 80/4 looked worryingly shaky on the scorecard. But Stewart came in and showed no fear, with 38* off 50 balls, and the scores were level when Richards threw the ball to the luckless Lambert to concede the winning runs. There was time for one final twist in the tale, though, as Ramprakash missed a straight delivery and was LBW, leaving Botham to come in and hit the winning runs off the next delivery - and his only international Test victory over the Windies, since he had been left out of the 1989/90 tour and had missed the Headingley match earlier this year. Somehow they just couldn't keep him out of the headlines. Smith's century gave him the match award: Gooch's consistent batting made him England's Man of the Series, and Ambrose's 28 wickets gave him the same award for the WI."

West Indies beat England 2–1 in the ODI series, then whitewashed England 5–0 in the Test series, and as of 2023 this was the only instance England faced such whitewash at home. This was the only test series where the home side lost all tests of a 4 or more match series.

England bowled West Indies out for 179 in the Second ODI at Trent Bridge, and levelled the series 1–1, but West Indies restricted England to 196 runs in the deciding Third ODI at Lord's and won easily, by 8 wickets.\nTest matches.\nThe Test series was a historic 5-0 \"blackwash\" to West Indies, with victories by wide margins in all 5 Tests.\nFirst Test.\nEngland won the toss and decided to bat. Half an hour into the opening session, debutant opening batsman Andy Lloyd was hit on the head by a short-pitched ball bowled by Malcolm Marshall. Lloyd left the field and spent several days in hospital; he did not play cricket again in 1984 and never played another Test Match. England were soon in trouble on 89–5, but Ian Botham hit 64 and England reached a total of 191, with Joel Garner taking 4–53.\nWest Indies reached 606 in reply, with five batsmen (and extras) reaching half-centuries. Top scorers were Larry Gomes (143) and Viv Richards (117), who shared a third-wicket stand of 206. Richards also became the fourth West Indian batsman to pass 5,000 runs in Tests. Captain Clive Lloyd scored 71, and the West Indian tail-enders were also in the runs, with number 9 Eldine Baptiste (87*) and number 10 Michael Holding (69) sharing a 9th wicket stand of 150. Derek Pringle took 5–108, one of four England bowlers to concede over 100 runs.\nDespite 56 by wicketkeeper Paul Downton, promoted to makeshift opening batsman in the absence of Andy Lloyd, England were unable to save the match, losing on the fourth day, with another 5-55 for Garner.\nSecond Test.\nWest Indies won the toss and put England in to bat. The decision looked poor after a century opening stand, and England reached 286, with opening batsmen Graeme Fowler (106) and debutant Chris Broad (55) top scorers, and extras third on 35. Marshall took 6-85.\nEngland took a first-innings lead when the West Indies were dismissed for 245, with Botham taking 8–103. This was the first occasion that an Englishman had taken 8 wickets against West Indies in England. Clive Lloyd scored a modest 39, becoming the second West Indian batsman to pass 7,000 Test runs. In England's second innings, Allan Lamb scored 110 and Botham 81, and England declared at 300-9 early on the fifth day.\nWest Indies achieved the target of 342 runs to win with ease, in 66.1 overs, losing only one wicket, thanks to an unbroken stand of 287 between Gordon Greenidge (214*) and Gomes (92*).\nThird Test.\nEngland won the toss and batted first again for the third Test running. Lamb reached 100 as England were all out for 270, and 4-70 for Holding. In the process, Holding became the second West Indian to take 200 Test wickets. The West Indies secured a narrow first-innings lead, reaching 302, with 104* to Gomes, and Holding second-highest on 59. Paul Allott took 6–61.\nEngland were bowled out cheaply in their second innings, for 159, with Marshall taking 7–53, his best career bowling analysis to date (notwithstanding a thumb broken in two places), and West Indies reached their victory target with 8 wickets in hand.\nBatsman Paul Terry made his Test debut for England, but scored only 8 and 1. This was the last Test played by Bob Willis.\nFourth Test.\nWest Indies won the toss and batted first for the first time in the series. By the close of the second day, they had reached 500 all out, with a second double century for Greenidge (223) and a century for wicketkeeper Jeff Dujon (101). Veteran off-spinner Pat Pocock, recalled for the match, achieved England's best bowling figures, 4–121.\nIn England's reply, their number 3 batsman, Paul Terry, playing in his second match for England, had scored 7 runs when he was struck by a ball bowled by Winston Davis. His arm was broken, and he left the field. England lost its ninth wicket with 278 runs on the board, needing 23 runs to save the follow-on. Terry returned with his arm in plaster and hanging by a sling. He watched Allan Lamb reach his century, but was then unable to defend his wicket, bowled without adding to his score by Joel Garner, his fourth wicket (4–51). England had reached 280, with Lamb again top scorer on 100*, his third century in consecutive Test matches, and extras second highest, on 44.\nEngland were made to follow on, and were bowled out for 156, Roger Harper's off spin taking 6–57. Terry did not bat for England again.\nFifth Test.\nIn the final Test, West Indies won the toss again, and again decided to bat. England bowlers Jonathan Agnew and Richard Ellison made their debuts, and England achieved rare penetration with the ball, reducing West Indies to 70–6. Clive Lloyd scored 60*, to bring them to a more respectable total of 190 all out before the close on the first day. Botham took 5–72, becoming the first cricketer to reach the all-rounders \"triple double\" of 300 wickets and 3,000 runs in Tests.\nEngland's batsmen were unable to capitalise on the relative success of their bowlers. They were bowled out for 162, with only Fowler scoring more than 20, Marshall taking 5–35. West Indies piled on the runs in their second innings, reaching 346, with a century to Desmond Haynes (125). Needing to score 375 to win, England subsided to 202 all out, with Botham top scorer on 54. Garner (4–51) and Holding (5–43) taking 9 wickets between them. On the final day, Pocock was the fourth Test cricketer to be dismissed for a \"pair\" in consecutive matches.\nLegacy.\nWest Indies achieved the fifth 5–0 whitewash in Test history, the first (and to date only) whitewash by a touring side in a test series that was longer than three matches, an unusual feat for a series played in England considering its variable summer weather. By the end of the Fifth Test the West Indies had won eight tests in a row and would go on to set the then-record of 11 consecutive wins. This series is generally seen as the height of West Indies' power, and the West Indies would remain the dominant Test nation for the rest of the decade."

        "title": "Dan Casey (baseball)",
        "text": "Daniel Maurice Casey (November 20, 1862 – February 8, 1943) was an American professional baseball player whose career spanned from 1884 to 1894 and 1899. He played in Major League Baseball, principally as a pitcher, over parts of seven seasons for four major league clubs. He saw his most extensive playing time with the Philadelphia Quakers, appearing in 142 games for that team from 1886 to 1889. He also appeared in 46 games for the Syracuse Stars in 1890.\nCasey led the National League with a 2.86 earned run average (ERA) and four shutouts in 1887 while playing for Philadelphia. Over the course of his seven seasons in the major leagues, he compiled a 96–90 win–loss record in 201 appearances, with a 3.18 ERA and 743 strikeouts.\nIn his later years, Casey claimed to be the Casey about whom Ernest L. Thayer wrote his famous poem, \"Casey at the Bat.\" Casey was given a parade honoring him as the famed \"Casey\", was featured on a national radio broadcast, and participated in a \"re-enactment\" of \"Casey at the Bat\" when he was age 78. The poem's author denied that his work was based on any real player, and several sources have called Casey's claim into doubt. Casey had a career batting average of .162 and one home run.\nEarly years.\nCasey was born in Binghamton, New York, in 1862. His parents, Hannah and William Casey, immigrated to the United States from Ireland. Casey grew up with five siblings on the family's farm in Broome County, New York, a short distance from Binghamton.\nProfessional baseball career.\nWilmington.\nIn 1884, Casey began his professional baseball career at age 21 with the Wilmington Quicksteps. He began playing for Wilmington while the team was part of the Eastern League and compiled a 10–2 win–loss record and 1.91 ERA in Eastern League play. Casey continued to play for the Quicksteps after the team joined the Union Association in August 1884, compiling a 1–1 record and 1.00 ERA in two games. The Quicksteps played only 18 games as a major league club and compiled a record of 2–16. Casey was the winning pitcher in one of the two victories in the club's brief major league history; a player known as The Only Nolan was the winning pitcher in the Quicksteps' other victory.\nIndianapolis and Detroit.\nIn 1885, Casey played with two different teams. He began the season with the Indianapolis Hoosiers of the newly formed Western League and compiled a 10–2 win–loss record and a 0.50 ERA in 12 games. In mid-June 1885, the Western League disbanded, and the majority of the Indianapolis players were signed by the Detroit Wolverines of the National League. Casey appeared in 12 games for Detroit and compiled a 4-8 (.333) win–loss record and a 3.29 ERA.\nPhiladelphia.\nCasey was acquired by the Philadelphia Quakers (later renamed the Phillies) of the National League prior to the 1886 season and played with that club for the next four seasons from 1886 to 1889. Casey enjoyed his career best seasons with Philadelphia, winning 66 games from 1886 to 1888.\nIn 1886, Casey threw 39 complete games and compiled a 24-18 (.571) record. Casey ranked among the National League's leading pitchers with four shutouts (2nd), a 2.41 ERA (6th), a Wins Above Replacement (WAR) rating of 6.2 (6th), a Walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) ratio of 1.165 (7th), 44 games started (8th), 24 wins (9th) and 193 strikeouts (9th).\nIn 1887, Casey led the league with a 2.86 ERA and four shutouts and compiled a career-best 28-13 (.683) record. He again ranked among the league's leaders pitchers in multiple categories with a 147 Adjusted ERA+ (1st), 10.4 WAR pitcher rating (2nd), a .683 win percentage (3rd), 28 wins (4th), 43 complete games (6th), innings pitched (6th), 1.260 WHIP (7th), 119 strikeouts (8th).\nIn 1888, Casey started 33 games, threw 31 complete games, and compiled a 14-18 (.438) record and a 3.15 ERA with 108 strikeouts. His playing time was reduced further in 1889 to 20 games started, as he compiled a 6-10 (.375) record and a 3.77 ERA.\nSyracuse.\nCasey played during the 1890 season with the Syracuse Stars of the American Association. He appeared as a pitcher in 45 games for Syracuse, threw 40 complete games and innings, and compiled a 19–22 record and a 4.14 ERA. He appeared in his last major league game on October 4, 1890, at age 27.\nMinor leagues.\nAlthough his major league career ended in 1890, Casey continued playing for several years in the minor leagues. His minor league career included stints with clubs in Jamestown and Albany, New York, in 1891, and Binghamton, New York, from 1892 to 1894 and 1899. In 1894, while playing for Binghamton, he struck out 15 batters in an exhibition game against the club from Rochester, New York.\n\"Casey at the Bat\".\nAfter retiring from baseball, Casey claimed to be the \"Casey\" about whom Ernest L. Thayer wrote his famous poem, \"Casey at the Bat\", which had first been published in 1888 by a San Francisco newspaper. Casey claimed that the poem was based on an August 1887 game in which he played for Philadelphia. He asserted that he had hit a \"lucky\" home run against Boston a week earlier and that Philadelphia trailed, 4–3, when he came to bat and struck out.\nIn support of his claim that the poem was based on his performance for Philadelphia, Casey pointed out that the Huntington Avenue Grounds where the Philadelphia Quakers played in 1887 was in a neighborhood once called \"Mudville\", the same name given to the locale in Thayer's poem. Casey claimed the area drew the name \"Mudville\" because the site was a vast mudhole before the ballpark was built.\nOver the years, a number of sources accepted Casey's claim. As early as 1900, after Casey was \"scalped\" in a streetcar accident, a newspaper account noted that there was \"no end\" to the persons claiming to be \"Casey\", but cited Dan Casey as the one true \"Casey\" who had been immortalized by Thayer. In July 1915, a local Binghamton baseball club, the Bingos, sponsored a \"Casey Day\" that included a parade honoring Dan Casey as the famed \"Casey.\" In March 1938, Casey appeared on Gabriel Heatter's radio program, broadcast on the Columbia network, to make his claim to being the famous \"Casey.\" During the broadcast, Casey stated: I've been waiting 50 years to tell you folks that Mighty Casey was just old Dan Casey, a pretty good ball player, but no home run king. But I guess if I hadn't struck out that day I never would have become famous.\nAfter Casey's radio broadcast, \"The Sporting News\" published a lengthy profile, complete with a photograph of the 75-year-old Casey with a bat on his shoulder, touting him as the \"Inspiration of Thayer's Poem.\" Two months later, in May 1938, \"Time\" magazine published a story referring to Casey as the \"Mudville Man.\" In approximately 1940, a supposed re-enactment of \"Casey at the Bat\" was played out prior to a Baltimore Orioles game; Rogers Hornsby threw two called strikes to the 78-year-old Dan Casey, and Casey then swung and missed on the third pitch, just as Thayer had written in the poem.\nOver the years, other players, including King Kelly and John Cahill, have been suggested as Thayer's inspiration, though Thayer himself reportedly denied that the poem was based on any real player. As early as 1900, Fred Pfeffer rejected Casey's claim: \"Now, you listen to me! That poem was never written about that Casey.\" In February 1943, a columnist in \"The Sporting News\" described Casey's claim to be Thayer's inspiration as a \"myth\" and wrote: \"Thayer ... always declared he had no particular player in mind as his hero. But despite this evidence, original 'Caseys' continue to appear, including Daniel, who was the most persistent and told the story so often he unquestionably came to believe it.\" Another writer examining the claim concluded that the game cited by Casey as the inspiration for Thayer did not end in a 4–3 defeat of Philadelphia. Rather, Casey got a hit in the ninth inning, driving in two runs, and the game was called due to darkness in a 5–5 tie. Yet another writer claimed to have disproved Casey's claim by pointing out that a strikeout required four strikes in 1887, when Casey claimed to have inspired Thayer by swinging and missing on a third pitch. The author of the latter story noted: \"In 1887, according to the rules so revised for that season only, Casey would have had another strike coming to him. That he didn't get it is evidence that Thayer was not writing about any incident in 1887 and that the late Dan Casey either was shortchanged, or was not the hero the author had in mind.\"\nFamily and later years.\nCasey was married in December 1889 to Minnie E. Cahill (sometimes later listed as Mary E. Casey) at a ceremony at St. Patrick's Church in Binghamton, New York. Casey and his wife had a daughter, Mable, in 1891.\nAfter retiring from baseball, Casey lived in Binghamton, where he worked from at least 1895 to 1920 as a trolley car operator for the Binghamton Railway Company. By 1930, Casey remained living in Binghamton with his wife, though he was not employed.\nAfter 1935, Casey and his wife later moved to Silver Spring, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C. Casey died in 1943 at age 80 in a hospital in Washington, D.C. He was buried at Fort Lincoln Cemetery in Brentwood, Maryland."

        "title": "Indian cricket team in England in 1932",
        "text": "The Indian cricket team toured England in the 1932 season under the title of \"All-India\". They were captained by the Maharaja of Porbandar. It was the national team's second tour of England following the one in 1911. India had just been granted the status of ICC Full Member and they played their inaugural Test match at Lord's in June. It was the only Test arranged on this tour and England won by 158 runs after scoring 259 and 275/8d in the two innings while India were bowled out for 189 and 187.\nIndia played 37 matches on the tour, including 26 first-class fixtures. Because of bad weather, two of their minor fixtures were abandoned without a ball being bowled. The team won nine first-class matches, drew nine and lost eight. The schedule was heavy with the team rarely out of action from the first match on 29 April to the last on 10 September. \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" (\"Wisden\") commented on this factor as something Indian cricketers of the time were simply not used to. As a result, the team suffered badly with muscle and tendon injuries which meant they became less effective as a team in their later matches.\nIndia's outstanding batsman was the right-handed C. K. Nayudu, who played in all the first-class matches, scoring 1,618 runs at an average of 40.45, including five centuries and a highest score of 162. In the 1933 edition of \"Wisden\", Nayudu was selected as one of the five Cricketers of the Year for 1932. India had a fine pair of opening bowlers in Amar Singh (111 wickets in first-class matches at 20.37) and Mohammad Nissar (71 wickets at 18.09). Amar Singh took ten wickets in a match three times and had a best innings return of 8/90.\nIndian tour squad.\nRamachandra Guha, commenting on the selection, said that it \"nicely reflected the balance of communal interests\". There were seven Hindus, four Muslims, four Parsees and two Sikhs. A number of players, including Vijay Merchant, refused to participate because of unrest at home and in support of Mahatma Gandhi who had been arrested in January 1932. Porbandar was the nominal captain but he played little and Nayudu was the \"de facto\" captain. In the times when only Royals used to be Captains, the Maharja of Porbandar official Captain and the official vice-captain Raja of Limbdi both stood down, in rare gesture of sportsmanship and cause of India for the Test match so that more talented Nayudu could lead the team. Thus due to their sacrifice of posts, the 1st Captain to lead India in Test series is recorded as C K Nayudu\nTest series.\nTeams in batting order.\nEngland: P. Holmes, H. Sutcliffe, F. E. Woolley, W. R. Hammond, D. R. Jardine (captain), E. Paynter, L. E. G. Ames (wk), R. W. V. Robins, F. R. Brown, W. Voce, W. E. Bowes.\nIndia: J. G. Navle (wk), Naoomal Jeoomal, S. Wazir Ali, C. K. Nayudu (captain), S. H. M. Colah, S. Nazir Ali, P. E. Palia, Lall Singh, M. Jahangir Khan, L. Amar Singh, Mohammad Nissar.\nFirst-class matches.\nIn addition to the Lord's Test, India played in 25 first-class matches. They visited all 17 County Championship teams for 19 matches (Glamorgan and Lancashire twice). Their other six first-class opponents were Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), Cambridge University, Oxford University, Scotland (at Forthill, Dundee), an England XI (at Cheriton Road, Folkestone) and H. D. G. Leveson Gower's XI (at North Marine Road Ground, Scarborough in the Scarborough Festival).\nTwo Indian players who were unavailable for India played against them. These were Duleepsinhji and Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi who were both England players. They represented their counties, Sussex and Worcestershire respectively. The third and final day of the match against MCC in May was lost to the weather and the result was a draw, but Nayudu had shown his quality with an innings of 118 not out, scoring more than half of his team's runs. Guha said it was his best innings of the tour and he hit a six which sent the ball so far that it \"was last seen leaving the Home of Cricket in an easterly direction\". \nApart from England, India's strongest opponents were county champions Yorkshire. The Indians met them at St George's Road, Harrogate from 16 to 19 July and were defeated by a six-wicket margin. Yorkshire didn't field their strongest team (for example, Herbert Sutcliffe didn't play) and they were reduced to ten batsmen by a first day injury to Maurice Leyland. Yorkshire won the toss and decided to field. India, with a top score of 48 by Naoomal Jaoomal, were all out for 160 on the Saturday, Hedley Verity taking five for 65. Yorkshire were 14 for two at the close and declared at 161 for eight on Monday. India were then taken apart by George Macaulay and Verity. Macaulay achieved a career-best eight for 21. India's second innings lasted only 25 overs and they were all out for 66. Remarkably, that total included a half-century as Nazir Ali scored 52; the next best score was 5 – the number of extras. Yorkshire with 68 for four rounded things off on the Tuesday morning.\nFar from being demoralised by their experience in Harrogate, the Indians went straight down to Lord's for the match against Middlesex from 20 to 22 July. It ended in a draw but the Indians opened with 409 for seven declared and forced Middlesex to follow on. Jaoomal and Nayudu both scored centuries. India's injury problems took their toll as the tour neared completion. At Folkestone in September, they lost to the England XI, which was by no means a Test-standard team, by an innings and 40 runs. Their last match in England was the Scarborough Festival game against Leveson Gower's XI and they were again struggling but this time saved by the weather, the match ending as a draw after the whole of the second day's play was lost.\nOther matches.\nIndia played in thirteen minor matches against a variety of opponents, travelling as far north as Elgin for one match. Fifteen minor matches had been scheduled but two, in Aldershot and Sunderland, were completely lost to bad weather. The latter of those was a match against Durham, then a member of the Minor Counties Cricket Championship. India played against four other minor counties.\nThey lost only one of the minor matches, conceding a surprisingly heavy defeat at West Park, West Bridgford in a two-day match against Sir Julien Cahn's XI by an innings and 26 runs. Apart from Cahn himself, his team was near enough county strength. It included Walter Robins, Denijs Morkel, Len Richmond and George Heane.\nAftermath.\n\"Wisden\" summarised the tour as one of \"immense value to the Indians themselves who, about the middle of the summer, were fifty per cent better than when they arrived, and the lessons they learned will no doubt be passed on to the Indian cricketers of the future\". India's next Test match in December 1933, their first at home, was against England to commence a three-match series which England won 2–0. Nayudu and Jardine were again the team captains."

        "text": "Stanley Love (born April 9, 1949) is an American former professional basketball player. He is the father of basketball player Kevin Love and the younger brother of Beach Boys singer Mike Love. During the late 1970s, Stan was also employed as a bodyguard, trainer, and assistant to band member Brian Wilson, the Loves' cousin.\nBackground.\nLove grew up in Baldwin Hills in West Los Angeles and was the fourth of six children to Milt, a union sheet metal worker, and Glee Love, a singer. His older brother is Mike Love. Mike, along with cousins Brian, Carl, and Dennis Wilson, later formed the Beach Boys.\nBasketball career.\nA 6'9\" forward, Love graduated from Morningside High School (where he was a center in his senior year), Inglewood, California, then played collegiately for the Oregon Ducks from 1968 to 1971.\nLove was the 9th pick in the 1971 NBA draft, chosen by the Baltimore Bullets. He was also selected by the Dallas Chaparrals in the 1971 ABA Draft. He had also been selected in the 1970 ABA Draft by the Texas Chaparrals while still an underclassman.\nLove had a four-year professional career with Baltimore, the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association, and the San Antonio Spurs, then of the American Basketball Association.

In 1982, Love and Pamplin were fined $750 and placed on six months' probation for a home invasion and assault on Dennis Wilson In 1990, Love filed a petition to be appointed as Brian Wilson's conservator, partly resulting in the court-ordered severing of personal and financial ties between Wilson and his therapist Eugene Landy in 1991.\nPersonal life and post-basketball career.\nLove married in 1986. He is the father of NBA champion Kevin Love, who has played for the Minnesota Timberwolves, Cleveland Cavaliers and Miami Heat. Love currently resides in Lake Oswego, Oregon."

The Russian synchronized swimmers (led by Olympic duet champions Anastasia Davydova and Anastasia Ermakova) delivered a superb performance to defend their Olympic title in the event, having received a straight line of five perfect marks from the judges for a composite score of 99.501. Japan maintained a silver-medal streak on its second Olympics by a single point short of Russia's score with 98.501, after displaying their explosive lifts and quick changes of pattern throughout the routine. Having failed to secure an Olympic medal in the sport from the previous Olympics, the U.S. squad assembled a colorful demonstration of multiple sequences and flying leaps to hold on for the bronze with a score of 97.418.\nEight teams competed, each consisting of eight swimmers (from a total team of nine swimmers). There was a single round of competition. Each team presents two routines: a technical routine and a free routine. The technical routine consists of twelve required elements, which must be completed in order and within a time of between 2 minutes 35 seconds and 3 minutes 5 seconds. The free routine has no restrictions other than time; this routine must last between 3 minutes 45 seconds and 4 minutes 15 seconds.\nFor each routine, the team is judged by two panels of five judges each. One panel is the technical jury, the other is the artistic jury. Each judge gives marks of between 0 and 10. The highest and lowest score from each panel are dropped, leaving a total of six scores which are then summed to give the routine's score. The scores of the two routines are then added to give a final score for the team."

        "text": "Matthew Jarrid Murphy (born February 23, 1980) is a former American football player. He was selected in the seventh round of the 2002 NFL Draft by the Detroit Lions. Murphy retired after the 2008 season. \nEarly life.\nMurphy was born to Michael and Dawn Murphy on 23 February 1980 in New Haven, Michigan. His uncle, Dwight Lee had played football in college at Michigan State where he had earned an All-American honorable mention.\nHe attended New Haven High School where he played six positions on the football team: defensive end, defensive tackle, fullback, linebacker, tight end, and wide receiver. During his senior year in 1996, Murphy compiled 80 tackles on defense and the Detroit Free Press named him an All-Met player.\nCollege career.\nMurphy attended the University of Maryland, where he played as a tight end for the Terrapins. He was the first player to commit to the Maryland's then new head coach Ron Vanderlinden.\nHe sat out the 1997 season as a redshirt (college sports) before acting as the second-string tight end behind Eric James. That season, Murphy saw action in six games but recorded no receptions.\nIn 1999, Murphy was moved from tight end to defensive end. He saw action against Western Carolina Catamounts, West Virginia, and North Carolina, recording 9 quarterback hits and 2 tackles. Murphy missed 2000 spring practice due to shoulder surgery.\nIn 2000, he saw action in all eleven of the Terps' games, including a start as a defensive end against Virginia. He returned to the tight end role later in the season. Murphy recorded two tackles and no receptions.\nIn 2001, Murphy played in eleven games, compiling twelve receptions for 137 yards. This season was Maryland's best in over a decade, with the team finishing with a 10–2 record, securing the Atlantic Coast Conference championship, and a Bowl Championship Series berth against fifth-ranked Florida, where Murphy led the Terps in receptions in the losing effort.\nProfessional career.\nMurphy was selected in the seventh round of the 2002 NFL Draft by the Detroit Lions (253rd overall). That season, he saw action in one game against the Minnesota Vikings, where he made one reception for a gain of eight yards. On 2 September 2003, Murphy was released and then the following day re-signed to the Lions practice squad.\nOn 10 December 2003, he was signed by the Houston Texans. He remained with the Texans for three years, playing one, eleven, and nine games in the 2003, 2004, and 2005 seasons, but did not compile any further statistics until 2005. Then, Murphy made two receptions for 26 yards, one for 14 and one for 12 yards.\nHouston then released Murphy and he signed with the Seattle Seahawks in the 2006 off-season, but was released on 2 September 2006. On 22 November 2006, Murphy was picked up by the Buffalo Bills. He played two games each for Buffalo in the 2006 and 2007 seasons, but compiled no statistics. Prior to the 2008 season, Murphy injured his shoulder during practice with a partial rotator cuff tear.\nHe was subsequently released from the Buffalo Bills, before being signed and then waived by the Denver Broncos."

        "text": "The men's sabre was a fencing event held as part of the Fencing at the 1912 Summer Olympics programme. It was the fifth appearance of the event.\nThe Hungarian fencers dominated the competition, with all 12 advancing to the semifinals. In 2 of the 4 semifinals, the Hungarians took the top three places. In a third, Hungarian fencers took the two qualifying spots while the third Hungarian did not start. In the remaining semifinal, Nedo Nadi of Italy placed second to become the only non-Hungarian fencer to advance to the final (the three Hungarians took first, third, and fourth in that semifinal).\nThe final consisted of 7 Hungarian fencers and Nadi. Nadi took fifth. Jenő Fuchs successfully defended his 1908 Olympic title, the first man to win multiple medals in the sabre. Béla Békessy took silver and Ervin Mészáros earned bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the fifth appearance of the event, which is the only fencing event to have been held at every Summer Olympics. Four of the eight finalists from 1908 returned: gold medalist Jenő Fuchs, silver medalist Béla Zulawszky, fifth-place finisher Péter Tóth, and sixth-place finisher Lajos Werkner, all of Hungary. Hungary was dominant in the sabre; Fuchs' 1908 victory started a run that lasted through 1964 in which the only Games that Hungary did not win the event was the one to which the nation was not invited (1920).\nRussia and Sweden each made their debut in the men's sabre. Austria made its fourth appearance in the event, most of any nation, having missed only the 1904 Games in St. Louis.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was held over four rounds. In each round, each pool held a round-robin. European sabre rules at the time used a larger target area than the post-World War I standard. In 1896, 1900, and 1908, the target area had been the whole body; the 1912 rules reduced that to \"all body parts, located above the horizontal line passing through the crotch\". (The 1904 competition used the American rules which became the standard now used.) Double hits were possible under the rules of the time."

This tensile membrane structure allows diffused light through into the arena reducing the need for artificial lighting. The light weight of the fabric also reduced the amount of steel required and saved on building costs. Brisbane-based company MakMax Australia (Taiyo Membrane Corporation) supplied and installed this roof along with other smaller outdoor structures at this venue.\nIt has twenty-three International Tennis Federation standard tennis courts, including the centre court and two showcase courts, representing all playing surfaces (hardcourt, clay and grass).\nThe centre court \"Pat Rafter Arena\", named in honour of the Australian tennis player Patrick Rafter, has a seating capacity of 5,500 (with an extra temporary seating of 1,500 bringing total capacity to 7,000).\nDavis and Fed Cup fixtures.\nThe Queensland Tennis Centre has hosted several ties in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup representative tournaments."

Edwards started every game of the 1947 World Series as the Dodgers were defeated in seven games by the New York Yankees. He hit into a Series-ending double play in the ninth inning of Game 7. Edwards finished fourth in balloting for National League Most Valuable Player Award, and was named to the National League team as a reserve in the 1947 All-Star Game.\nIn 1948, infield troubles forced the Dodgers to move Edwards to third base for half of the season while rookie Roy Campanella was brought up from the minor leagues to play as catcher. His batting average dropped to .276 with 8 home runs and 56 runs batted in, as the Dodgers fell to third place in the National League. An arm injury incurred during spring training in 1948 as well as the blossoming of Campanella as a hitter eventually relegated Edwards to second-string status, although he was still considered among the best catchers in the National League.\nOn June 15, 1951, Edwards was traded by the Brooklyn Dodgers to the Chicago Cubs as part of an eight-player trade. In July, he earned his second All-Star berth when he was named as a reserve in the 1951 All-Star Game. Edwards appeared in only 50 games in 1952, mostly as a pinch hitter.\nIn , he was sent down to the minor leagues where he played for the Springfield Cubs before becoming the player-manager for the Cubs' minor league affiliate, the Des Moines Bruins of the Western League. Edwards played as a third baseman and hit .321 while he managed Des Moines to a fourth-place finish, winning the Western League play off championship. He performed so well that the Cubs announced in October that he would return to the major leagues as a third baseman. However, after appearing in only four games with the Cubs in April 1954, he returned to the minor leagues where he played for the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League, posting a .298 batting average in 106 games.\nIn December 1954, he returned to the major leagues again when his contract was purchased from the Angels by the Washington Senators. After only one season with the Senators, Edwards was released during spring training in 1956. He signed by the Cincinnati Reds as a free agent in July 1956 and played in his final major league game on September 13, 1956. Edwards returned to the minor leagues to play two seasons with the Visalia Redlegs before ending his playing career in at the age of 34.\nCareer statistics.\nIn a ten-year major league career, Edwards played in 591 games, accumulating 429 hits in 1,675 at bats for a .256 career batting average along with 39 home runs, 241 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .335. He ended his career with a .982 fielding percentage. A two-time All-Star, Edwards led National League catchers once in putouts and once in baserunners caught stealing. Edwards was the Dodgers' catcher on September 9, , when pitcher Rex Barney threw a no-hitter against the New York Giants.\nEdwards died of a heart attack in his home in Sacramento, California, on April 25, , at the age of 51."

        "text": "Brian Patrick O'Connor (born April 21, 1971) is the head baseball coach of the Virginia Cavaliers. Previously serving as an Associate Head Coach at Notre Dame, he was hired on July 8, 2003, to replace the retiring Dennis Womack (who moved on to assistant athletic director of facilities management and operations). O'Connor has taken the Virginia baseball team to fourteen NCAA baseball tournaments during his 15 seasons in Charlottesville, including the 2009 College World Series, the first in school history; the 2011 College World Series, as the No. 1 national seed; the 2014 College World Series, as the No. 3 national seed; and the 2015 College World Series, which they won and became National Champions for the first time in school history.\nO'Connor is a native of Omaha, where the College World Series is held each year.\nPlaying career.\nCollege.\nO'Connor graduated from Creighton University in 1993 where as a pitcher he posted a career record of 20-13 with seven saves and a 3.78 ERA. He was an integral starter in Creighton's 1991 College World Series team. To this day he carries on a close relationship with former pitching coach Todd Wenberg.\nMinor league.\nO'Connor was selected in the 29th round of the Major League Baseball draft by the Philadelphia Phillies. He posted a 4–2 record with a 4.03 earned run average for the Martinsville Phillies of the Appalachian Class A League in 1993.\nCoaching.\nCreighton University.\nAfter his time with the Philadelphia Phillies organization, O'Connor rejoined his college team as their pitching coach from 1993 to 1995.\nUniversity of Notre Dame.\nAt Notre Dame under head coach Paul Mainieri, O'Connor served as an assistant coach for the Fighting Irish from 1995-2001 before being promoted to associate head coach in 2001. He was named the 2001 National Assistant Coach of the Year by the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) and Baseball America. Brian was also named the AFLAC National Assistant Coach of the Year in 2003. O'Connor worked with the Fighting Irish's pitchers and also served as the program's recruiting coordinator. Eleven years after playing in the College World Series, he was coaching in it for the Fighting Irish in the 2002 Series.\nUniversity of Virginia.\n2004.\nO'Connor was named the head baseball coach at Virginia on July 8, 2003. In his first season as head coach, he guided UVa to one of the most successful seasons ever in the history of the baseball program. He led the Cavaliers to a 44-15 overall record and an 18-6 mark in the ACC. The 18 wins were the most ever by a Cavalier team in league play at the time. For the first time in school history, Virginia hosted an NCAA Regional in its own backyard when Davenport Field at the UVa Baseball Stadium played host to the Charlottesville Regional. It was Virginia's fourth NCAA appearance in school history. O'Connor directed the Cavaliers to a second-place finish in the league in 2004. Virginia swept five three-game series over conference foes for the first time ever, including a three-game sweep over ACC-favorite Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia., for the first time in school history. The Cavaliers also swept Clemson in three games for the first time in 32 years (since 1972).\n2005.\nO'Connor followed up the 2004 season by going 41-20 overall and 14-14 in the ACC in 2005. As the No. 7 seed in the conference tournament, he led the Cavaliers to the championship knocking off three ranked opponents along the way including two wins over No. 12 Clemson and a win over No. 18 NC State. During the 2005 season, Virginia posted nine wins over ranked opponents including a three-game sweep of No. 4 Georgia Tech in Charlottesville, which was his second straight sweep of the Yellow Jackets during the regular season. The Cavaliers led the ACC in team ERA (2.74) for the second straight year.\n2006.\nThe Cavaliers topped the old school record for wins by winning 47 games on their way to a 47-15 mark. UVa also topped its record for conference wins going 21-9 in a tough ACC finishing third overall and just one game behind divisional champion, North Carolina. Virginia hosted the second NCAA Charlottesville Regional in 2006. Four players were named All-ACC led by Doolittle, who was the ACC Player of the Year. The end result was the best regular season finish ever at Virginia by turning in a mark of 45-11 overall. The Cavaliers set a school record for best winning percentage in a single season (.758), ranked third nationally in team ERA (3.04) and 19th nationally in batting average (.322).\n2007.\nVirginia went 19-9 in the ACC and 45-16 overall before losing to eventual national champions Oregon State in the NCAA regional at Davenport Field. The Cavaliers led the league in ERA for the fourth consecutive year at 2.81. Jacob Thompson has a league-best 1.50 ERA and was a consensus first-team All-American, while Sean Doolittle was a second-team All-American. Virginia had a number of impressive road wins, including wins over #1 North Carolina and their first-ever series win at Clemson.\n2009.\nThe Cavaliers went 49-15-1 in their '09 season and finished 6th in the ACC, before winning their first ACC tournament title since 1996, and the first under Oak. Coach O'Connor led Virginia to a sixth consecutive regional appearance, which they won and moved on to their first Super-Regional. They defeated the University of Mississippi at Oxford in three games, which brought the Cavaliers to their first College World Series in school history. They lost to LSU, defeated and eliminated Cal State Fullerton, and then lost to University of Arkansas in a historic extra-inning game. As a Council Bluffs native, Coach O'Connor had the local crowd support at Rosenblatt Stadium. He was also voted 2009 National Coach of the Year.\n2010.\nUVA went 51-14, setting a school record for wins, and finished 1st in the ACC Coastal. They earned their first national seed in program history (#5). O'Connor led Virginia to a seventh consecutive regional appearance, which they won and moved on to their second straight Super Regional, before losing to Oklahoma in 3 games. O'Connor won his first ACC Coach of the Year award since 2004.\n2011.\nO'Connor led UVA to their best season to date, going 56-12, setting a school record for wins, and finishing 1st in the ACC Coastal, before winning his second tournament title in three years. The team earned their first number one overall national seed in program history. O'Connor led Virginia to an eight consecutive regional appearance, which they won and moved on to their third straight Super Regional, before beating UC-Irvine in 3 games, with a walk-off in game 3. The team fell in the semifinals of the CWS to eventual champion South Carolina. O'Connor won his third ACC Coach of the Year award. All-American pitcher Danny Hultzen was taken #2 overall in the draft.\n2012.\nUVA went 39-19-1, just the second time under O'Connor that they failed to win 40+ games (2008), and finished 2nd in the ACC Coastal. O'Connor led Virginia to a ninth consecutive regional appearance, which they lost at home, with Oklahoma advancing to the Super Regionals.\n2013.\nUVA went 50-12, winning 50 games from the 3rd time in 4 years, and finished 2nd in the ACC Coastal. They earned another national seed (#6). O'Connor led Virginia to a tenth consecutive regional appearance, which they won and moved on to the [Super Regional, before losing to eventual runner-up Mississippi State in 2 games. O'Connor won his fourth ACC Coach of the Year award.\n2014.\nO'Connor led UVA to another banner season, going 53-16, winning 50 games for the fourth time, and finishing 2nd in the ACC Coastal. The team earned their fourth ever national seed in program history (#3). O'Connor led Virginia to an eleventh consecutive regional appearance, which they won and moved on to their second straight Super Regional, before beating long-time rival and Maryland in 3 games. His team went 3-0 in the CWS elimination rounds, before losing a hard fought 3 game series to Vanderbilt and finishing runners-up for the first time in school history. O'Connor won his fifth ACC Coach of the Year award, while Nathan Kirby, Mike Papi, and Nick Howard earned All-American honors, and were 3 of the 8 Cavs named to the All-ACC team. 5 players were named to the CWS All-Tournament team.\n2015.\nO'Connor's UVA team finally broke through and won it all a year after a runner-up finish, but took an interesting path to get there, going 44-24, and finishing 2nd in a down ACC Coastal (only 15-15). The team was plagued by injuries throughout the season, until finally getting healthy late in the season. This including the school's first ever road sweep of 3 games at North Carolina, to clinch a spot in the ACC Tourney. O'Connor led Virginia to a twelfth consecutive regional appearance, which they won (in California, like in 2009, but as a regional 3 seed this time) and moved on to their third straight Super Regional, and 6th in 7 years. Due to Maryland's upset of #1 UCLA in their regional, UVA and (now-B1G member) Maryland were matched up in the Supers in Charlottesville for the second straight seasons. Led by game-winning hits by the 8 hole-hitter in game 1 (3-run double in the 8th), and the 9-hole hitter in game 2 (a walk-off 2-run double), both off of the Terps' All-American closer, UVA went back to the CWS for the 4th time in history, all under O'Connor. Aided by a few lucky bounces against Florida, UVA made it back to the national title series, against Vandy again. Clutch hitting and pitching allowed UVA to upset the favored Commodores, winning their first ever title in baseball. They scored the go-ahead run in 5th inning or later in all 10 of their postseason wins. Nathan Kirby earned the 6-out save a year after imploding in game 1 of the CWS Finals. UVA placed 5 members on the All-Tournament team again, with pitcher Brandon Waddell repeating (complete game in game 2 of 2014, 7 innings in game 3 of 2015, allowing only 2 runs each time). Closer Josh Sborz was the MOP, after going 3-0 with a save in 4 CWS appearances, allowing 0 runs in 13 innings. During the entire tourney, he went 4-0, saved 3 games (in 8 appearances), and allowed only 1 unearned run in 19 innings. After the season, O'Connor was awarded National Coach of the Year Awards from Collegiate Baseball, Perfect Game, and Baseball America.\n2016.\nOn May 27, O'Connor won his 595th game as UVA's coach, 7–2 over Louisville in the ACC Tournament, setting the school record for career wins. He led UVA to its thirteenth consecutive regional appearance, and as a regional host for the eighth time in his thirteen seasons as UVA's coach.\nPersonal.\nO'Connor was born on April 21, 1971, in Omaha, Nebraska. He graduated high school in 1989 from Saint Albert H.S. in Council Bluffs, Iowa. He married the former Cindy Petratis of Council Bluffs, Iowa. The couple has three children: two daughters and a son."

        "title": "Tennis at the 2008 Summer Olympics",
        "text": "Tennis competitions at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing were held from August 10 to August 17 at the Olympic Green Tennis Centre. The DecoTurf surface rendered the event a hardcourt tournament.\nThe women's singles event proved notable for being one of only two Olympiads — and the first since 1908 — in which all tennis medalists were from the same country – with Russian women sweeping the medals.\nThe men's singles featured the first time an Olympic tennis player had medaled in consecutive Olympiads since the 1920 Games, while the men's doubles gave Switzerland its first medal in the event. The doubles also returned Switzerland and the United States to the medals stand for the first time since the 1988 re-introduction of the sport.\nQualification.\nThe majority of players in the singles competitions (56 of 64 players in the draw) gained entry through their position in either the ATP (men) or WTA (women) rankings. The remaining eight places were given to six players who gained ITF places (wild cards) and two who received invitations from the Tripartite Commission, which were intended to go to National Olympic Committees (NOCs) with small teams. For the doubles competitions, 10 players qualified directly. The remaining 86 places were allocated by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) based on world singles rankings. This method of allocating doubles places angered some players, such as Leander Paes, and led to some perceived discrepancies: Martin Damm and Pavel Vízner of the Czech Republic, ranked eighth in the ATP Race, were not seeded, whereas Nicolás Almagro and David Ferrer of Spain, who were highly ranked in singles but had not played doubles together before, were seeded fifth.\nIn the doubles, as in every team event at the Olympics, athletes had to compete on the side of athletes from the same NOC. This method of forming teams meant that Canadian world number one Daniel Nestor had to find a new partner (his partner at the time was Serb Nenad Zimonjić) and led one South African player, Liezel Huber, to seek U.S. citizenship so that she had the opportunity to play. Each NOC could submit a maximum of 6 players; this sextet could be composed of a maximum of four singles players and four doubles players (two teams).\nThe rankings of July 9 were used to determine the direct entrants. A number of tournaments, including the prestigious Wimbledon Championships took place between this date and the time of the Games beginning, and some players re-entered the qualification places during this time. Rainer Schüttler, who was propelled up the rankings by his semi-final appearance at Wimbledon, went to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and won his right to play at the Olympics, provoking a hostile response from the ITF, as it was a deviation from their original regulations.\nITF places.\nITF places, ostensibly a form of wild card, were awarded to six players in both the men and women's singles, with one further place dispensed in the women's competition after Stephanie Vogt, entering via the Tripartite Commission, withdrew. The four official criteria for ITF place consideration were world ranking (no numeric specification), whether the country was represented in the tennis event, the number of players on site, and geographical location. However, there was some flexibility to these regulations: ITF president Ricci Bitti stated that it was his intention for the ITF places to grant opportunities to young players and players from under-represented countries, and to reward players who had competed diligently for their nation in the Davis or Fed Cup, or whom were former medalists.\nThe ITF places were announced on July 30. Sun Peng was originally the only Chinese man to enter the men's singles, and did so through the ITF places. Accompanying Sun were multiple Grand Slam doubles titlists Max Mirnyi and Jonas Björkman (who was retiring at the end of the year), nascent stars such as Kei Nishikori and Kevin Anderson, and defending champion Nicolás Massú. In the women's singles, the ITF places went to Alicia Molik, a bronze medalist in 2004, and Chan Yung-jan, a young player, with the remaining spots going to Mariya Koryttseva, Nuria Llagostera Vives, Ayumi Morita, Selima Sfar (a veteran Fed Cup player), and Tamarine Tanasugarn, who gained the retrospective place.\nPreview.\nDespite debate being re-ignited about tennis's place at the Olympics, and the attestations of some players (such as Andy Roddick, who chose to play an American tournament in order to prepare for the U.S. Open), that the Grand Slams remained the pre-eminent tennis tournaments, the 2008 Games saw the strongest field of competition since tennis's re-introduction to the Olympics in 1988. The singles competitions featured 17 of the top 20 men, and 18 of the top 20 women, with all of the top five men in attendance. This was a huge improvement on only 12 years ago in Atlanta, when only 3 men from the world's top 10 entered. Players had been further incentivized to compete at the Olympics after the ATP and WTA began awarding ranking points as of the 2000 Games.\nApathy towards the Games was still present, as Roddick and 2004 Men's Singles silver-medalist Mardy Fish opted not to play in Beijing to better prepare themselves for the U.S. Open, and Tom Tebbutt, commenting for \"The Globe and Mail\" (Canada), said \"tennis appears headed for a downer at the Olympic Games\". However, many players expressed their enthusiasm for the Games, including Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Jonas Björkman, Nicolás Massú, Andy Murray, Jelena Janković, Elena Dementieva, Alicia Molik, and Venus and Serena Williams. Novak Djokovic and Svetlana Kuznetsova said that they felt the Olympics were of equal or even greater prestige than the Grand Slams, and Federer maintained that the Olympics were one of his priorities for the season.\nMen's singles.\nBy winning gold in this Beijing Olympics, Rafael Nadal cemented his place in tennis history by winning gold in his first try. In the calendar year preceding the 2008 Olympics, there was a shift at the hierarchy of men's tennis as Rafael Nadal displaced Roger Federer as the world number one, after his record consecutive 237-week stay at the top of the rankings. From the second round of the 2008 Hamburg Masters to the semi-finals of the 2008 Cincinnati Masters (the last tournament before the Games), winning the French Open and Wimbledon in between, Nadal had won 32 consecutive matches. Due to the way the rankings are accrued, Nadal became number one on August 18, the day after the Olympic tournament, although this had been confirmed earlier. Nadal was therefore considered a strong favorite, as was Federer, who, despite reaching two Grand Slam finals, had had a poor year by his standards. Other top-ten players considered to be favorites included the reigning Australian Open champion, Novak Djokovic, Spanish world No. 4 and 2007 Tennis Masters Cup finalist David Ferrer, James Blake, David Nalbandian, Nikolay Davydenko and British player Andy Murray, who was lauded in the British press after winning the Cincinnati tournament and reaching the semi-finals of the previous week's Toronto Masters.\nThree Chinese nationals appeared in the men's draw, but none qualified automatically, with Sun Peng relying on the places issued by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), and Yu Xinyuan and Zeng Shao-Xuan replacing withdrawn players as alternates.\nBy losing the final and thus settling for silver, Chile's Fernando González became the sixth tennis player, and fourth male player, in history to have won gold, silver and bronze medals in Olympic tennis. Following his gold medal, Nadal would later become just the second man to win a Golden Slam - Olympic gold in addition to the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open - with victory at the 2010 US Open (the first man to win a Golden Slam had been Andre Agassi, who completed his set at the 1999 French Open after winning gold in Atlanta in 1996.) He would also be elected as Team Spain's flagbearer for the opening ceremony in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 after being forced to withdraw from the London 2012 tournament at Wimbledon due to tendinitis.\nWomen's singles.\nThe women's game also underwent a period of transition in 2008. Justine Henin, the incumbent world number one and reigning Olympic champion, retired on May 14, citing a lack of motivation for the game. Since then, three women had held the number one spot, and two, Maria Sharapova and Ana Ivanovic, had grappled with injury and poor form after successful first halves of the year. The pair were subsequently forced to withdraw from the Olympics. The favorites included Jelena Janković, who assumed the world number one ranking on August 11, the second day of the tennis tournament; Russians Svetlana Kuznetsova, the world number three, Elena Dementieva, who was a silver medalist at the 2000 Summer Olympics, and Dinara Safina, the French Open finalist who had won back-to-back tournaments in the weeks before the Olympics; and the Williams sisters Venus and Serena, who had strong Olympic pedigree having won the singles (Venus) and doubles in 2000, and who had recently played each other in the Wimbledon final.\nA trio of players also represented China in the women's draw, although all three qualified automatically, unlike in the men's. They were Li Na, who was a semi-finalist at the Tier I Doha before succumbing to injury for most of the Summer; Zheng Jie, who raised hopes by becoming the first Chinese player to reach the semi-finals of a Grand Slam singles tournament at Wimbledon; and Peng Shuai.\nVenue.\nSurface – DecoTurf II\nCompetition.\nFormat.\nThe tennis competition at the Olympic Games consisted of a single elimination tournament. The size of the singles draw, 64, meant that there were six rounds of competition in total, with five in the doubles owing to its smaller draw size of 32. Players reaching the semi-final were assured of an opportunity to compete for a medal, as the two losers in the semi-finals contested a bronze medal match.\nMatches were \"best-of-3 sets\", except for the Men's singles and doubles finals which were \"best-of-5 sets\". The decisive final set had no tiebreak. With athletes needing a two-game advantage to win the match, this led to one match's final set, the men's doubles semi-final between Arnaud Clément &amp; Michaël Llodra and Simon Aspelin &amp; Thomas Johansson, extending to 19–17 in Aspelin &amp; Johansson's favour.\nCalendar.\nNote: \"due to rain delays the Women's Singles schedule was pushed back a day.\"\nDay 1.\nOn Day 1, the conditions were at a humidity level of 89%, and ITF commentators felt that this, along with the heat and smog, would result in fatigue for some players, especially in longer matches. Play did not begin at the scheduled time of 10 a.m., and was delayed until 12.53 p.m., when number eight seed James Blake began his match against Chris Guccione on the Centre Court. The Women's Singles competition also commenced. However, play was suspended again at 4.26 p.m., and eventually cancelled for the rest of the day.\nOnly nine matches of the 20 scheduled matches were completed as a consequence of the rain-disrupted sessions. Blake progressed, as did fourth seeded Russian Nikolay Davydenko, Chilean Fernando González, Czech Tomáš Berdych, and Argentine Guillermo Cañas, who benefited from a retirement from his opponent Frédéric Niemeyer, who was a set up, and said that he withdrew from the match in order to save himself for his doubles match with Sydney champion Daniel Nestor (their match eventually took place the following day). Blake said that he had been inspired to victory by fellow American Michael Phelps, who won his first of eight gold medals in swimming, in the 400 metre individual medley, on the same day. In the women's draw, Dane Caroline Wozniacki, Australian Samantha Stosur, Italian Francesca Schiavone, and Bulgarian Tsvetana Pironkova all progressed.\nDay 2.\nOn Day 2, humidity levels again proved to be unfavourable for players, with some saying that it was the worst they had ever played in. Play was only mildly interrupted by rain, with three scheduled matches failing to reach their conclusion. Defending champion Nicolás Massú defeated Steve Darcis (Belgium), and Rafael Nadal came through against Potito Starace (Italy) in three sets, in what the BBC described as a \"tough\" match. Roger Federer, still the top seed, progressed, as did other seeds such as Serb Novak Djokovic, Argentine David Nalbandian, Frenchman Gilles Simon, and Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka. Former world number one Lleyton Hewitt came through a testing match against Jonas Björkman, 7–5, 7–6(2), and Rafael Arevalo, one of the three players to be invited by the Tripartite Commission, won against Lee Hyung-taik, in what was his first match against a top 100 player. The highest seed to exit was Spain's David Ferrer (number five). The number six seed, Britain's Andy Murray, also lost, playing against Chinese Taipei representative Lu Yen-hsun. Along with Ferrer, number fourteen seed Nicolás Almagro and the unseeded Tommy Robredo also exited, meaning that three of the four Spanish representatives in the men's singles went out.\nIn the women's singles, María José Martínez Sánchez became the first player to progress on the day, knocking out Alicia Molik. Second seed Jelena Janković won, as did American Serena Williams, Russian Elena Dementieva, Slovakian Daniela Hantuchová, and Frenchwoman Alizé Cornet amongst others, in their first round matches. Two seeds fell, both to Chinese opponents: Li Na defeated number three seed Svetlana Kuznetsova (Russia), and number 11 Ágnes Szávay (Hungary) lost to Zheng Jie. Afterwards, Zheng, a native of Sichuan, said the courage shown by the victims of the earthquake in May 2008 had helped inspire her to victory.\nThe men's doubles competition also began, having originally been scheduled to start on Day 1. Chris Guccione and Lleyton Hewitt (Australia) defeated Agustín Calleri and Juan Mónaco (Argentina) 4–6, 7–6(4), 18–16. The match, which lasted three hours and 17 minutes, was the longest (in games, in a three set match) in Olympic history at 61. The previous record was held by Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde (Australia) and Jacco Eltingh and Paul Haarhuis (Netherlands), who competed a 54-game match (6–2, 5–7, 18–16) at the 1996 event. Elsewhere, defending champions Massu and Gonzalez exited, Steve Darcis and Olivier Rochus (Belgium) defeated Guillermo Cañas and David Nalbandian (Argentina) in a match that exceeded two and a half hours, and Canada's only doubles team of Nestor and Niemeyer lost to the Murray brothers of Andy and Jamie (Great Britain). Federer and Nadal both came through, with their partners Wawrinka and Robredo, respectively.\nDay 3.\nFederer, Nadal, and Djoković, the top three seeds respectively, all saw safe passage into the second round on Day 3. However, Federer's countryman Wawrinka exited after losing to Austrian Jürgen Melzer, in what the ITF commentary team called a \"bad loss\". Notable losers included Massu, who went out to number seven seed Nalbandian; and Davydenko, the third seed, who lost to Paul-Henri Mathieu (France). Gilles Simon and Gaël Monfils were two other French players to progress to the third round.

Number thirteen seed Patty Schnyder (Switzerland) also lost. One of the Chinese hopefuls, Peng, had the President of the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (BOCOG), Liu Qui, courtside for her match against Alizé Cornet, but she was beaten in two sets. Her compatriot, Zheng, came through another long match.\nIn the doubles, Bahamian Mark Knowles, a Grand Slam champion and the world number seven coming into the event, was knocked out, partnering Devin Mullings, by the Bryan brothers (United States). Mullings came into the Olympic tournament without a doubles ranking, and with a singles ranking of 1017. Other teams progressing including Martin Damm and Pavel Vízner (Czech Republic), who defeated Djoković and Nenad Zimonjić (Serbia). In the women's doubles, Liezel Huber and Lindsay Davenport (United States), both former Grand Slam doubles champions, came through. The other American team in the draw, the Williams sisters, came through a tough match against the Czech team of Iveta Benešová and Nicole Vaidišová, as did Zheng and Yan against the Slovak team of Hantuchová and Janette Husárová. The Russian team of Dinara Safina and Svetlana Kuznetsova, which combined two top ten singles players, progressed too.\nMedal summary.\nMedal table.\nRussia, the country that finished atop the medal table, won all three of its medals in the women's singles. This made them the first nation to win all three medals in an Olympic tennis competition since Great Britain in 1908. Rafael Nadal's gold for Spain made him the first Spanish tennis player to win a gold medal at the Olympics, and Nadal was also the first player from within the men's top 5 ranking to win in Olympic competition. Serbia, competing at an independent NOC for the second time, won its first tennis medal; and the United States continued to be prolific in women's doubles, having won every competition (including this one) since 1988, except in 2004.\nFernando González, who won the silver medal in men's singles, became the first tennis player since Charles Winslow (at Stockholm 1912 and Antwerp 1920) to win consecutive Olympic medals, having won gold (doubles) and bronze (singles) in 2004. In the men's doubles, Switzerland won its first medal in the event, and Sweden and the US returned to the podium for the first time since 1988.\nRetrieved from Beijing Olympics 2008 official website.\nRanking points.\nRankings points determine the position of a player in the ATP (men's) and WTA (women's) rankings, which are based on players' performances in the previous 52-weeks. For the Olympics, the men's player who won received 400 ranking points—put in perspective, this was 100 more than a win at the most prestigious International Series Gold tournaments, 100 less than a Masters Series win, and 600 less than a triumph at one of the four Grand Slam tournaments."

        "text": "The Kamer 2 Sailing Marathon was a 50 kilometer steeplechase type regatta for sloops in the lake district between Amsterdam and Leiden in The Netherlands. The race is held each year in September and attracts some 70 participants. Boats can be crewed by a team of three or, for all female teams, four. The race leads from the Kaag Lake through Does and Wijde Aa to the Braassemermeer and from there through the Ringvaart to the Westeinderplas. There a turning point is situated directly beneath the watertower of Aalsmeer from where the race goes back along the Ringvaart to the Kaag Lake.\nA significant part of the route leads through narrow waterways with fixed bridges. As a result, the competition is restricted to sloops with masts that can be lowered and raised easily. Some of the canals are too narrow to be negotiable upwind by sail. Therefore, participants are allowed to paddle, punt or tow their sloops to overcome trajectories that offer prohibitive circumstances for sailing. When winds are strong the Kamer 2 Sailing Marathon is essentially a sailing race. In quiet weather, however, paddling and mast handling skills can become crucial for victory. Due to the length and difficulty of the route, it is not unusual that more than half of the participants do not reach the finish line in time (before dusk).\nThe Kamer 2 Race was first organized in 1992 by Hanz Zwart, the first non-Frisian winner of the Brio Race, a similar contest over 60 kilometers held each year in Friesland in May. Since 2003 the race is organized by a group of sailing centres in Kaag Village. From 1999 through 2003 the race was dominated by the Hoogenboom family team. In 2008 the race was cancelled due to lack of interest, and the race has not been organized since."

Hunter said that defeating Hendry in the arena \"has to be the best result I have ever achieved\". He was aware the latter was missing long-distance pots. \"Stephen had a couple of decent breaks so it was important I did as well just to show him how well I was playing. I thought I would be nervous at the end but I was totally relaxed.\" Hendry commented Hunter was better that day but felt he could have won had he potted a quarter of the long-range shots he played, adding, \"It's disappointing to lose any match anywhere and this is no exception. I hate losing and I always will.\"\nThe other semi-final was between Harold and O'Brien. A break of 97 won O'Brien frame one and Harold took the second on a 116 break. On both sides of the mid-session , O'Brien won four frames in a row to lead 5–1. Harold won the next three frames to be 5–4 behind. In frame ten, O'Brien exchanged multiple before winning the frame and the match 6–4 on the black ball to advance to the final. Post-match, O'Brien said: \"It was a big battle. The pressure was beginning to build towards the end and I could see it slipping away. I was fortunate to be 5–1 up after not really dominating the match but it's a great win for me.\" Harold commented, \"I left myself with a little too much to do. It was a bridge too far. You can do that kind of thing once but doing it again is too much to ask.\"\nFinal.\nThe final between Hunter and O'Brien was played as the best-of-19 frames over two before 2,483 spectators on 11 February. When Hunter missed the pink in the first frame, O'Brien won it after half an hour and took the second following Hunter's miss on the blue ball.

He earned £175,000 prize money for winning the competition, which was his first major victory since the 1998 Welsh Open. He commented on the success, \"To add my name to this trophy is a dream come true. I perhaps haven't fulfilled my potential but I'm only 22 and hopefully there are a lot more titles left in me.\" O'Brien said he was disappointed to have missed a red ball in frame 11 for a possible 8–3 lead, which he felt lost him the chance to win the Masters, adding, \"It's disappointing to lose like I did but I've had a great week and beaten some fantastic players. I was a little tired but that's not an excuse. But I'll replay some of those misses in the last frame for some time to come.\"\nMain draw.\nFirst round.\nNumbers given in brackets after players names show the competition's 15th and 16th seeds.

        "text": "Lewis J. Brown (February 1, 1858 – January 15, 1889) was an American Major League Baseball catcher and first baseman for seven seasons and played for six different teams from 1876 to 1884. Brown was primarily a catcher, but he also logged over 100 games as a first baseman. He also appeared twice as a pitcher.\nCareer.\nBefore playing in the major leagues, Brown was a member of the Boston Stars, a popular amateur team that played at Boston Common. He was teammates on that club with future major league player John Morrill. \nIn 1876, Brown debuted in the major leagues. Two of his early teams - the 1877 Boston Red Caps and the 1879 Providence Grays - won league pennants. Brown missed the season due to being blacklisted for \"confirmed dissipation and general insubordination.\" He retired from baseball after the 1884 season. \nAfter baseball.\nBy 1887, he was working as a bartender at the Saracen's Head, a Boston saloon run by the widow of boxer Joe Goss. He played in a benefit game that year with other retired players at the South End Grounds, and he had gained a surprising amount of weight since leaving baseball. By July 1888, Brown said that he had reduced his weight to 214 pounds and that he was hoping to play baseball again. \nDeath.\nIn 1889, Brown died at the Boston City Hospital at the age of 30. The \"Chicago Tribune\" explained further: One night at the Saracen's Head, Brown was engaged in a friendly wrestling match with a customer, and the men did not stop wrestling when Mrs. Goss asked them to do so. She became angry and swung at the men with a piece of gas pipe, striking Brown in the knee. The injury led to the amputation of Brown's leg, and he was said to have been left in a weak and delirious state. He died of pneumonia during that hospitalization.\nBrown is interred at Forest Hills Cemetery."

        "title": "Mark McCormack's world golf rankings",
        "text": "The McCormack rankings were unofficial world golf rankings published in Mark McCormack's \"World of Professional Golf Annual\" from 1968 to 1985, and were a forerunner of the current Official World Golf Ranking. Unlike their replacement they were not used to select fields for tournaments, and served no real purpose other than as a talking point.\nThe rankings were the first that had been compiled that took account of results from all the world's major professional tours, from the United States, Europe, Japan, Asia, Africa, and Australia. The system rewarded players for their finishing places in tournaments played over a three-year period, with more points awarded for more recent achievements, and more points awarded for major championships and tour events with strong fields than for those in other tournaments. They also reflected McCormack's philosophy that victory should be strongly rewarded, wherever in the world it took place – winners of tournaments received additional bonus points, and only high finishers in tournaments received any recognition - for example just the top ten places received ranking points in major championships.\nThe first player to lead the rankings was McCormack's client Jack Nicklaus (although Nicklaus left his business arrangement with McCormack in 1970), and he continued to lead them for almost all of the 1970s decade. He would be succeeded as number one in 1978 by Tom Watson, who in turn was succeeded in 1983 by Seve Ballesteros. Had McCormack's rankings of the time been based on results over just the most recent two years, like their modern counterpart, Gary Player would have been number one in 1969 instead of Nicklaus, Raymond Floyd number one at the end of 1982 instead of Tom Watson (despite the latter's two major victories that summer) and Bernhard Langer would have been number one at the end of 1985 instead of Ballesteros. All the other year-end number ones, however, would have remained as they were on the three-year system.\nThe first ranking list, taking account of results from January 1966 to December 1968, included five American players in the top ten (Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Billy Casper, Julius Boros and Frank Beard) and five non-Americans (Gary Player, Bob Charles, Neil Coles, Peter Thomson and Kel Nagle). By 1976, the ranking list was almost totally dominated by American players – Nicklaus, Hale Irwin and Johnny Miller were the world's top three – and only two of the top ten (Gary Player and Graham Marsh) were non-Americans. The last ranking lists, published in the mid-1980s, reflected the shift in dominance back away from American golfers by that time – in 1984, five of the top ten were non-American, and in the last list published in December 1985, the top three players in the world – Seve Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer and Greg Norman – were all non-American.\nIn the years the rankings were published, the highest position attained by a British player was sixth – by Tony Jacklin in 1972, and Nick Faldo in 1984. The rankings were notable for the high positions reached by the leading Japanese players of the day, with Masashi Ozaki, Isao Aoki and Tsuneyuki Nakajima all achieving top-ten rankings at various times.\nIn 1986 McCormack's system was taken up by The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews and became the Sony Rankings. At first the Sony Rankings were only used by the Royal and Ancient to exempt players from qualifying for The Open Championship (in particular to allow invititations to be sent to the leading American players, some of whom were reluctant to travel to have to pre-qualify), but in 1997 they were endorsed by all of the principal men's professional tours (five at that time) and renamed the Official World Golf Ranking. Over the years the Official rankings have come to be used to select players for an increasing number of important tournaments, including the major championships, the World Golf Championships and the European Ryder Cup side.\nRanking leaders.\nThe following table lists the top five players in the rankings each year.\nSingle-year points leaders.\nFor the years that the rankings were compiled, the following golfers earned most points during each single calendar year:"

        "text": "The ITF Men's World Tennis Tour (formerly \"ITF Men's Circuit\") is a series of professional tennis tournaments held around the world that are organized by the International Tennis Federation. The tour represents the lowest rung of the men's professional tennis ladder. ITF tournaments are incorporated into the ATP rankings, enabling young professionals to progress on to the ATP Challenger Tour and ultimately the full ATP Tour. Nearly every professional player has spent some time on the ITF Men's World Tennis Tour.\nFormat.\nOriginally, the ITF Men's Circuit consisted of satellite tournaments, each of which took place over four weeks. However, in the late 1990s, the ITF introduced Futures tournaments, allowing for greater flexibility in the organization of the tournaments for national associations, and participation in tournaments for players. Over time, the ratio of Futures tournaments to satellites increased until 2007, when satellites were eliminated.\nFutures tournaments allow for players to win career titles and improve their rankings. Futures are held in both singles and doubles and last one week. As of 2017, the prize fund for each tournament is either US$15,000 or US$25,000. Some tournaments also provide housing for participants. Futures usually have sizable qualifying draws, which allow unranked players to enter tournaments and earn ATP ranking points.\nIn 2019, reforms were made to the circuit, renaming it the ITF World Tennis Tour as a new umbrella name for former Pro Circuit and Junior Circuit tournaments and will serve as the player pathway between the junior game and the elite levels of professional tennis. The launch of the tour is the culmination of a series of ITF reforms designed to support talented junior players in their progression to the senior game, and target the prize money effectively at professional tournaments to enable more players to make a living."

        "text": "Robert Nicholas Jones (born 10 November 1965 at Trebanos, Wales) is a Welsh rugby union coach and former player. He was capped 54 times for Wales during his career, at that time a record. He and Gareth Edwards, Rob Howley, Dwayne Peel and Mike Phillips are the only scrum halves to have achieved 50 caps or more for Wales.\nJones attracted widespread admiration during his playing career for his invention and the quality of his passing, which was often referred to by pundits as the best in the world. In addition his box-kicking from the base of the scrum or line-out was a potent weapon, used to best effect during Wales' 1989 victory over England at Cardiff Arms Park and the subsequent Lions tour to Australia. His attractive style of play earned him many invitations to play for the Barbarians in addition to his club and international selections.\nHe made his debut for Swansea RFC as a schoolboy and went on to play 287 games between 1983 and 2001/02, scoring 52 tries, and captaining them in 1989/90 and 1990/91.\nJones also made an appearance for the British and Irish Lions against a Rest of the World XV in 1986.\nHe formed a notable partnership for Wales with the outside-half Jonathan Davies before the latter's move to rugby league. Jones and Davies were important members of the Welsh team that won the Triple Crown in 1988. One of the most memorable tries of that championship came in the game against Scotland, when Jones supplied Davies with a long reverse pass, the latter then kicking ahead and beating his Scottish marker for pace to the goal line. Later in the same game Jones sent two high-quality passes to Davies under extreme pressure, enabling Davies to score a drop goal on each occasion and win Wales the match.\nIn 1989 Jones was part of the victorious British and Irish Lions tour to Australia, enjoying some memorable confrontations with the Wallabies' scrum half Nick Farr-Jones. In 1993 he toured New Zealand with the British Lions.\nJones also played for Western Province in South Africa during the 1994 Currie Cup tournament, forming a memorable partnership with South African fly-half Joel Stransky. He also played for English club Bristol, captaining them in 1997/98.\nJones was succeeded at scrum-half for Wales by Rupert Moon, a move which attracted some controversy. Few would disagree that Jones was the more technically accomplished scrum-half. However, he was often playing behind a weak Welsh pack at the time and Moon was brought in because of his more physical attributes rather than for his superior scrum-half technique.\nJones retired from international rugby after the 1995 World Cup in South Africa, and from all rugby in 2001.\nSince retiring, Jones can often be heard on BBC radio as a rugby pundit, and he was an assistant coach at the Llanelli Scarlets.\nFor the past ten years he has featured regularly on television as both a pundit and commentator and has featured in many documentaries on a number of TV channels including BBC, Sky, ITV, Channel 4, S4C and RTE. He is a regular on the BBC Wales rugby programme 'Scrum V', both as a live commentator and as a pundit. He was a recurring guest on the S4C Welsh language chat show 'Jonathan', hosted by his Welsh half-back partner Jonathan Davies."

Richards played fly-half for his club side Swansea and was much more effective in that position and indeed his greatest Welsh performance was against Scotland in 1980 when he moved from centre to fly-half when Davies was injured. he played a fine game and scored a magnificent try. He played 305 games for Swansea between 1972/73 and 1985/86, scoring 111 tries, and captained the club in 1981/82, 1982/83 and 1983/84.

Davies was an all-round sportsman, representing Welsh schools at cricket and played for Glamorgan County Cricket Club's second XI. He then studied chemistry at the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology (UWIST), later University of Wales, Cardiff, and later studied for his teaching qualifications at St Catherine's College, Oxford. Davies used this experience as an alumnus ambassador for the Seren Network.\nMarried to Fiona, Davies has two adult daughters.\nRugby career.\nDavies started his rugby career at Tumble RFC and Gwendraeth Grammar School. He briefly played for Llanelli RFC whilst still at school before moving to Cardiff RFC for whom he played for 12 years, during the amateur era of rugby, representing the club in over 380 games and amassing 3500 points – still a club record.\nHis drop-goal helped UWIST win the 1976 UAU Cup Final, beating University of Wales, Swansea, 6–4. He also represented Oxford in the 1977 Varsity Match.\nDuring this time he gained 21 Welsh caps, captaining them five times, and winning a Triple Crown in 1979. He toured with the British and Irish Lions to South Africa in 1980, and injured his knee in the second test at Bloemfontein.

        "title": "Premier League Snooker",
        "text": "The Premier League Snooker was a professional non-ranking snooker tournament. It was held from 1987 until 2012. The tournament was played in a round-robin format over a number of weeks, normally from mid-September to early-December, around the other World Snooker events in various locations.\nHistory.\nThe event started in 1987 as the Matchroom League. The inaugural event was won by Steve Davis, who retained the title in the following three years. The matches were of eight frames and all frames were played out. Three points were awarded for a win and one point for a draw. The winner of the tournament was the player, who finished top of the league. In 1990 there was also a tournament in Europe, called International League. There had also been an earlier attempt to run a league-style format in snooker in 1984, which was called the Professional Snooker League. However it was beset by financial problems and was withdrawn after one season.\nIn 1992 a play-off system was added. The top four players after the leagues phase advanced to the semi-finals and a final was held to determine the winner. In 1993 the event was renamed the European League and in 1998 the Premier League Snooker. In 2005 Betfred took over the sponsorship of the tournament and introduced a 25-second shot clock and the matches in the league phase were shortened to six frames. In addition they offered £1000 for every century and frame won in the league phase. In the 2005/2006 season the event was moved from the second half of the calendar to the first, thus there were two events in 2005.\nThe event was dominated by Steve Davis, Stephen Hendry and Ronnie O'Sullivan, who between them won 20 of the 27 titles in the competition's history. O'Sullivan was the tournament's most successful player, winning ten titles in total, including five consecutively between 2005 and 2008. In 2013 the Premier League was discontinued and replaced by the Champion of Champions.\nFormat of play.\nThe league was an invitation-only event, contested mainly by players in the world's top 10. The combination of players was chosen though to have maximum televisual appeal, so it was usual for a mixture of high-ranked players, upcoming youngsters yet to reach the top 10, celebrated older players out of the top 10 and players with an appeal to international (non-UK) markets such as Asia or Australia to be selected. The players played each other once in a 8-frame match (10-frames in 1984). Unlike other snooker events, a draw was a possible result in the league. 2 points were awarded for a victory, and 1 for a draw. At the end of the leagues phase, the top 4 players in the league table went forward to the best of 9 semi-finals stage. The final was then played over the best of 13 frames. From 2008 Matchroom Sports started to hold a qualifying event, called Championship League. The winner of this competition was invited to the leagues phase of the Premier League Snooker.\nThe major difference from other tournaments was the presence of a shot clock. Each player has 25 seconds to strike the from the time the clock starts. This is determined by the timing official, and the clock normally starts when the balls have come to rest from the previous shot or after a is . The penalty for exceeding the limit is 5 points and is classed as a miss. Each player is allowed five time outs per match where the clock is stopped and they may have as long as they require to take their shot. A player is permitted no more than three time outs per frame.\nIn 2011 the format was changed. All evenings in the league stage featured three matches: two semi-finals and a final. All matches were best of 5 frames, with no dead frames played, points were awarded for every frame won. Meaning that the maximum number of points a player can obtain was 24 and the minimum was 0. All frames were subject to a 20-second shot clock and the miss rule was changed; meaning that a player had three attempts to make legal contact with a ball or otherwise ball in hand was given to the incoming player anywhere on the table. The final frame of any match was played under shoot out rules. Each player appeared on 4 nights and was seeded to determine who they face. The play-offs were played to the rules used in previous editions. In 2012 the format of the event was changed back to the format used before 2011.\nPrize fund.\nThe winner of the Premier League Snooker competition collected £50,000, while the runner-up would receive £25,000. Both of the losing semi-finalists also pocketed £12,500 each. Except for 2011, there was also a bonus fund of £1,000 per frame won and £1,000 per century break during the league phase. The £1,000 frame winning and £1,000 century bonus did not apply during the semi-finals or final. In 2011 the highest break of the night was awarded with £1,000.\nMedia coverage.\nFrom 1987 to 2004, the Betfred Premier League matches were recorded and shown as-live, initially by ITV until the early 1990s when Sky Sports took over coverage. Since 2005 all matches have been televised live by Sky Sports, the introduction of live coverage coinciding with a relaunch of the league."

In his last season at LaSalle-Peru, Goff was a team captain and had 34 tackles, 24 assists and two sacks at defensive tackle which earned him All-America honors from Blue Chip Illustrated. He also was Illinois's sectional heavyweight wrestling champion and finished 6th at the state tournament.\nCollege career.\nGoff played in 47 games (24 starts) during his four-year career at Iowa (1994-1997). In his freshman campaign Goff played in 11 games.\nHe saw action in 12 games, opening the final 11 contests as a sophomore in 1995. Goff played in 12 games (one start) as a junior in ‘96 after suffering a back injury in the season opener. As a senior, he started all 12 games at right guard in 1997 for the nation’s eighth-ranked rush offense.\nGoff majored in sociology at Iowa.\nProfessional career.\nCincinnati Bengals.\nGoff was selected by the Bengals with the 78th pick in the third round of the 1998 NFL Draft. Future teammate in Cincinnati and San Diego Steve Foley was drafted three spots below him. Before being drafted by the Bengals in 1998, he posted score of 38 on the Wonderlic intelligence test. It was the second-highest score among offensive linemen tested at the ’98 NFL Combine.\nIn his rookie season, Goff played in 10 games, starting five. He missed six games due to a partial ligament tear in his left knee.\nIn 1999, Goff started only one game, the season finale. The rest of the year, he saw reserve action at right guard.\nIn 2000, Goff became the starting right guard for the Bengals. During the season, he led Cincinnati's offensive line, playing in 991 of a possible 1,001 snaps. He was also a huge reason for the performance of Corey Dillon that year. Dillon rushed for 1,435 yards, a Bengals team record and their rush offense ranked second in NFL.\nIn 2001, Goff was once again the starting right guard for the Bengals and was the only offensive lineman to play all 1,071 offensive snaps as he and the rest of the offensive line allowed only 28 sacks, fourth-fewest in team history.\nIn his fifth year, Goff started all games he played in at right guard but missed three games due to a knee laceration.\nIn 2003, what would be his final season with the Bengals, Goff played and started all 16 games.\nSan Diego Chargers.\nOn March 5, 2004, Mike Goff signed a five-year contract with the San Diego Chargers. Goff, then 28, received a $3.5 million signing bonus and the total of the deal was $13.25 million. After signing with the Chargers in 2004, Goff immediately assumed a leadership role on the offensive line. He took youngsters Nick Hardwick, Shane Olivea and Marcus McNeill under his wing. He even opened his Pacific Beach home to guard Kris Dielman and regularly hosted members of the offensive line and other current and former teammates to his house for dinner. Before the season, Goff embraced the role of the underdog saying\" \"I don't give a (darn) what other people say,\" \"They say that all the time, unless you got eight Pro Bowlers. Everyone always questions the offensive line. That's fine. You accept that challenge and it makes you want to work harder to prove everybody wrong.\" \"on Aug 20, 2004.\nIn his first year with the Bolts, he started all 16 games at right guard as he played between rookies Nick Hardwick and Shane Olivea. That year, the Chargers ranked sixth in rushing offense and allowed the fourth-fewest sacks in the league. After the season, Goff was named to the All-Joe Team by USA Today and earned second-team All-Pro honors from Football Digest.\nIn 2005, Goff started all 16 games at right guard as the Chargers ranked in the top ten in rushing offense and in the top half of the league in sacks allowed as he was the only offensive lineman to start all 16 contests for the Chargers. He was named first-team All-Pro by Sports Illustrated and earned USA Today All-Joe honors for the second year in a row.\nIn the 2006 season, Goff started all 16 games for the fourth consecutive season as the Chargers ranked second in rushing offense and eighth in sacks allowed. It was a special season for him and the Chargers. The team had a franchise best 14 and 2 record and running back LaDainian Tomlinson rushed for an NFL record 28 Touchdowns and 1,815 yards. Although he was not named to the Pro Bowl, two of his linemates were: Nick Hardwick and Marcus McNeil.\nIn 2007, Goff was once again constistent as the veteran started all 16 games at right guard and was named to the USA Today All-Joe team.\nIn his final season with the Chargers, 2008, Goff's performance decreased. He still started 16 games and was an effective starter but with the emergence of Jeromey Clary, the Chargers seemed keen to the idea of not resigning the veteran guard.\nKansas City Chiefs.\nMar 25, 2009, Goff signed with the Kansas City Chiefs on a two-year deal. His first and only season in Kansas City was difficult and frustrating as he played in only 8 games for a Chiefs team that won only 4 games. On Feb 24th, 2010 the Chiefs released Goff.\nCoaching career.\nMike Goff is in his first season as the offensive line coach at Western Kentucky University. Prior to joining WKU, Goff worked as graduate assistant coach for the offensive line at USC as well as an offensive and defensive analyst.\nPrior to joining USC, Coach Goff was an offensive line volunteer assistant coach at San Diego State for 2 seasons (2010–11) and an assistant coach at Hilltop High School in Chula Vista, California (2014).\nPersonal life.\nOne of Goff’s most recognizable characteristics used to be his long hair. In the summer of 2007, Goff cut his hair for a good cause as he donated it to Locks of Love, a public non-profit organization that provides hairpieces for children under 18 who have lost their hair as a result of undergoing chemotherapy treatments.\nOutside of football, Goff’s hobbies include reading, movies, golf, fishing and traveling, but his favorite hobby is cooking. Mike learned to cook by watching The Food Network and enjoys having teammates over to the house to sample his many specialty dishes. Since then, they have crowned him with the nickname “Chef.” \nToday, Goff is married and lives in the San Diego area. He regularly contributes as an analyst on XTRA Sports 1360, a San Diego sports radio. He has a Twitter account and can be followed at @mikegoff79."

        "title": "Irish Amateur Swimming Association",
        "text": "The Irish Amateur Swimming Association (IASA) was the national governing body of swimming in Ireland. The organisation was founded in 1893 and held responsibility for the various aquatic disciplines until it was dissolved in January 1999 following a series of sexual abuse scandals.\nFollowing the winding up of the IASA, it was replaced as a national governing body of aquatic sports in Ireland by Swim Ireland.\nFoundation.\nThe Irish Amateur Swimming Association was created after a meeting between the Leinster Swimming Association and Ulster Swimming Association in Fisher's Restaurant, Donegall Place, Belfast on Saturday 25 November 1893. Prior to this meeting, the two associations had been founded and developed in tandem since 1890 when the British Amateur Swimming Association had suggested that the number of clubs in Ireland now warranted an independent association.\nEarly years (1894-1913).\nOn 4 August 1894, J. McDermid of Templemore A.S.C. became the first Irish Champion under the new Association's rules when he annexed the 100 yards Championship of Ireland at the Belfast Waterworks ornamental pond. While Leinster Swimmers had some success at Irish Championships in these early years, their progress was impeded by a lack of indoor facilities in the region at this time and it was not surprising that some of the organisations first international sides were dominated by Ulster swimmers. Likewise in water polo, early inter provincial matches were dominated by Ulster. The side chosen for the organisation's very first international was made up of all Ulster men with the exception of R.A. Andrews from Blackrock WPC. This first international was held in Westminster Baths, Great Smith Street, London on Monday 23 September 1895.\nIn 1904, three clubs from Cork had formed themselves into the Cork Swimming Council and had applied for membership of the IASA as the Munster Branch of the IASA.\nIreland was among the founding members of the Federation Internationale de Natation Amateur (FINA) being represented at the meeting on 19 July 1908 during the London 1908 Olympiad by Dr. WJ Dockrell and HM Dockrell.\nDuring the period 1893 to 1914, Leinster swimmers dominated Irish Championships. Of the 80 Championships swum, Leinster won 66. Of these, 54 were won by just five swimmers, namely HM Dockrell (6), Oscar Conway (9), Jim Beckett (10), and George Dockrell (20).\nDiving also began to develop in Ireland over this period. 1900 had seen the first National Diving Competition was held at Highgate Baths, London and was won by EG Coldwell representing Sandycove SC. Influenced by this early success the sport of diving began to take root in Leinster and the Leinster High Diving Championship was introduced.\nInterwar period (1915-1940).\nThere were only three Irish Championships held in 1914. No further championships or AGMs were held until 1919. Swimming continued at a local level in all three affiliated provinces. WV Edwards, 220 yards champion in 1912 like many others was killed in action in 1917 and others like Trevor Chute would return again and swim but as an amputee.\nWhen an AGM was held again on 31 May 1919, the decision was made to introduce 'ladies' events in national championships - the 100 yards and Diving Championship for ladies as well as an Irish Water Polo Championship. This decision was long overdue – as early as 1874 a Miss Rounds of Dundrum won a 440 yards ladies' race at Blackrock, County Dublin, but the account of this event was treated in a humorous and superficial manner by \"Figaro\" in the \"Irish Times\". On the other hand, in 1875 the \"Irish Sportsman\" editorialised on the desirability of learning to swim in order to prevent tragic drownings and scorned the notion that worries over \"nakedness\" should prevent one from swimming. In the same year it further commented on \"Swimming and the Fair Sex\" and urged that prevalent prudery in that regard be dropped.\nThe inaugural Ladies' 100 yards Irish Championship was held on 2 August 1919 at Blackrock Baths. Miss May Armstrong, the outstanding female swimmer of that period, was the winner. She would repeat this feat for the following six years.\nBy 1920, the move towards having athletes representing Ireland independently at the Olympic Games was underway and although a Munster motion \"that Ireland take no part in the Paris Olympic Games unless separate representation\" was defeated, a motion \"that Ireland seek to secure separate representation at future Olympiads\" was carried. In due course, an invitation to Ireland to take part in the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris was received.\nPrior to these games, it was alleged the British Olympic Council had stated that Ulster-born athletes could not compete for Ireland. The IASA replied that as far as swimming was concerned Ireland would be represented as an entire entity or not at all. This latter approach prevailed and a team travelled and competed which was representative of the whole of Ireland. Ireland were represented at the 1924 Summer Olympics by a water polo team captained by Noel Purcell. No \"speed\" swimmers participated however.\nBy 1930s, diving had grown as a sport also and the early success of Coldwell was followed by that of Eddie Heron, who had dominated the sport since the 1930s. He became a household name and a report from his exhibition in Foynes, County Limerick in 1940 records the crowd at 5,000. Unfortunately, there was a lack of adequate indoor diving facilities over subsequent periods.\nInternational success in the subsequent period in swimming and water polo was limited and much of the period was dominated by political wrangling between the different branches and discussions over which flag swimmers should compete under. The organisation endured however, and in 1934 a Connacht branch joined the IASA achieving the goal of a single governing body for the island as a whole.\nGradual modernisation (1940-1990).\nBy 1941, the \"Sunday Independent\" was reporting crowds of 100,000 spectators at the Liffey Swim and the volume of clubs had increased exponentially over the preceding decade. The state of national championships was not satisfactory as championships were often held in unsuitable and non-standard conditions. Many of the best swimmers did not always attend the championships and as a result the event was often won by the best local swimmer with times which varied largely depending on the speed of the current. As a result, in 1941 the decision was taken to create a Centralised Championship Gala to be held over the August Bank Holiday weekend at Blackrock Baths.\nThe success of this format which was held in Blackrock from 1941 to 1948 lead to the rotation of the Gala to various baths across the country and began a rotation of the championship between the provinces.\n1962 saw the first indoor National Championship Gala which was held at Butlin's Holiday Camp, Mosney, County Meath. 1963 saw the first national championship to be televised from the Grove Pool in Belfast. The 1960s were a period of innovation in Irish swimming with the introduction of national squad training, development of centralised programme for teachers and coaches, and an increase in the number of indoor pools. International results also began to improve with the country's first individual winners in internationals, victories at the ASA Championships, and re-entering the Olympics.\n1990 saw the first introduction of computerisation at the national championship held in 1990 at the Guinness Pool. By the turn of the millennium, Ireland still did not have an Olympic-sized pool, placing any swimmer training here at an enormous disadvantage at international competition.\nMichelle Smith - Olympic medals and controversy.\nAt the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Michelle Smith became Ireland's first Olympic medalist in swimming - winning three golds and a bronze. A shadow was cast over these medals when subsequently in 1998 she was banned for 4 years from the sport for tampering with a urine sample using alcohol during a mandatory out of competition test.\nAbuse scandals and abolition.\nIn the late 1990s, various abuse scandals came to light. They led eventually in 1999 to the abolition of the IASA and its replacement with a new national governing body, Swim Ireland.\nDerry O'Rourke, Olympic coach in 1980 and 1992, was convicted on 27 sexual abuse charges against minors and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment in 1998. He received a further sentence of 10 years in 2005 for repeated rape and indecent assault of a female swimmer between the ages of 14 and 18.\nGeorge Gibney, national and Olympic coach (1984-1991) and teacher at Newpark Comprehensive School in the 1970s, was charged with 27 counts of sexual abuse involving children and youth he coached. A judicial review in 1994 prevented the case from proceeding due to the length of time that had elapsed since the alleged incidents took place. He left Ireland to live in the United States. Following the release of the BBC podcast \"Where is George Gibney?\", it was revealed that the Gardaí were including new victims in their ongoing investigation of historical sexual abuse. A file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions in November 2023.\nFrank McCann, Irish team manager from the 1980s through to the 1990s, was convicted of the murders of his wife and child to prevent them discovering he had sexually abused an underage swimmer and had fathered her child."

        "title": "History of the Cricket World Cup",
        "text": "The Cricket World Cup, the top-level and the most important competition in One Day International cricket, was first played in 1975. This tournament, known as \"The Prudential World Cup\", was played in England and was won by the West Indies. Since then, the tournament has been played every four years, in a number of different countries. Between eight and sixteen teams have contested the various competitions, and lengths of matches have ranged from 60 overs per side in the early tournaments down to 50 overs per side in recent ones.\nPrior to the World Cup.\nThe first cricket Test match was played in 1877 between Australia and England. Cricket was contested at the 1900 Summer Olympics where Great Britain defeated France by 158 runs. However, the International Olympic Committee cancelled cricket as an Olympic sport afterwards.\nThe first attempt at arranging an international cricket competition was the 1912 Triangular Tournament. It was a Test cricket tournament played in England between all three Test playing nations at the time; England, Australia and South Africa. Due to poor weather and a lack of public interest, the experiment was not repeated. From then on, international Test cricket teams only generally engaged in bilateral series as opposed to tournaments or leagues involving more than two nations.\nIn the early 1960s, English county cricket teams began playing a shortened version of cricket, which only lasted for one day. One-day cricket started as a 4-team knockout competition, known as the Midlands Knock-Out Cup in 1962 and later as the Gillette Cup in 1963, and grew in popularity, resulting in a national league called the Sunday League to be created in 1969. The first One Day International came about from a rain-aborted Test match at Melbourne between England and Australia in 1971 and was played on the final scheduled day. The forty over match (eight balls per over) was used to fill the time as compensation for the frustrated crowd.\nThe success and popularity of the domestic one-day competitions in England and other parts of the world as well as the early One-day Internationals prompted the International Cricket Council to consider organising a Cricket World Cup.\nThe Prudential World Cups.\nThe Men's Cricket World Cup was first held in 1975 in England, which was the only nation that was able to put forward the resources to stage an event of such magnitude. The first three tournaments were officially known as the Prudential Cup after the financial services company Prudential plc who sponsored the event. The matches were of 60 overs per team and played in traditional white uniform and red balls. They were all played during the day. Eight teams participated in the first tournament: Australia, England, the West Indies, Pakistan, India, and New Zealand (the six Test nations at the time), with Sri Lanka and a composite team from East Africa. One notable omission was the South African cricket team who were not competing due to the international sports boycott. West Indies won the first Cricket World Cup by defeating Australia by 17 runs in the final.\nThe next two World Cups held in 1979 and 1983 were again hosted by England. The 1979 Cricket World Cup saw the introduction of the ICC Trophy, a competition used to select non-Test playing teams for the World Cup. Sri Lanka and Canada qualified through the ICC Trophy in 1979. West Indies again won the World Cup tournament, defeating England by 92 runs. At their meeting which followed the World Cup, the International Cricket Conference agreed to make the competition a four-yearly event.\nThe 1983 event was hosted by England for a third consecutive time. By this time, Sri Lanka had become a Test playing nation, and Zimbabwe qualified through the ICC Trophy. India were crowned champions after upsetting the West Indies by 43 runs in the final. The odds of India winning the cup were quoted at 66 to 1 before the competition began.\n1987–1996.\nThe 1987 Cricket World Cup held in India and Pakistan was the first World Cup hosted outside England. It was also the first tournament where the West Indies were unable to reach the final. The games were reduced from 60 to 50 overs per innings, the current standard, because of the shorter daylight hours on the subcontinent when compared to England. Australia won the championship by defeating England by 7 runs, the closest margin in World Cup final history until 2019.\nThe 1992 Cricket World Cup held by Australia and New Zealand brought many changes to the game such as coloured clothing, white balls, day/night matches and an alteration to the fielding restrictions. It was the first tournament that the South African cricket team played in, following the end of the international sports boycott. Referred as the 'Cornered Tigers' at the time, Pakistan overcame a dismal start to emerge as winners, defeating England by 22 runs in the final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.\nThe 1996 championship was held in the Indian subcontinent for the second time, with the inclusion of Sri Lanka as host of some of its group stage matches. It occurred behind the backdrop of political upheaval in world cricket, after a spiteful Sri Lankan tour of Australia in 1995/96. After the no-balling of Sri Lankan off spinner Muttiah Muralitharan by Darrell Hair in a Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the tour ended in a spiteful ODI final in Sydney which saw physical contact between Glenn McGrath and Sanath Jayasuriya, and the refusal of the Sri Lankans to shake hands at the end of the match. Some Australian players received death threats, which were compounded by a Tamil Tiger bombing in Colombo. Australia and West Indies refused to play their respective matches against Sri Lanka there, causing both matches to be awarded to Sri Lanka by default. After protracted negotiations, Kenya and Zimbabwe agreed to fulfil their fixtures in Sri Lanka. The Australian led boycott drew heavy criticism from subcontinental cricket officials, with former Indian captain Kapil Dev calling for Australia to be expelled.\nOn the field, the abrasive and dry subcontinent surfaces resulted in batting conditions being optimal early in the innings before the ball became softer and more difficult to strike. Of the five leading run-scorers, four were opening batsmen, with Mark Waugh becoming the first batsman to score three centuries in a tournament. Spin bowlers were the most effective, with four of the leading six wicket-takers. The quarter finals saw co-hosts India and Pakistan meet in Bangalore. After Pakistani captain Wasim Akram withdrew due to injury, Ajay Jadeja struck 40 from the last two overs from Waqar Younis, setting Pakistan a target of 288. Pakistan were going well at 109/1, but after Aamer Sohail confronted taunted Indian bowler Venkatesh Prasad after striking a boundary, Prasad bowled him immediately after, sparking a collapse of 3/19, all to Prasad. After falling 39 runs short, the Government of Pakistan launched an inquiry into the performance, after angry protests by the public which left one person dead, and accusations of match-fixing were levelled at Wasim. In the other quarter finals, Australia and Sri Lanka defeated New Zealand and England respectively, while South Africa, who were previously undefeated, were upset by the West Indies.\nIn the semi-final, Sri Lanka, headed towards a crushing victory over India at Eden Gardens (Calcutta) after their hosts slumped to 120/8 from being 98/1 in pursuit of 252, were awarded victory by default after riots broke out in protest against the Indian performance. In the other semi-final in Mohali, Australia defeated the West Indies after the Caribbean team lost their last seven wickets for 29 runs in their run-chase. Sri Lanka went on to claim their inaugural championship by defeating the favourites Australia in the final by seven wickets, held in Lahore. Tension remained between the two sides after the Australian series, with Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga declaring Australian leg spinner Shane Warne in the media before the match, and proceeding to poke his tongue at Warne during the match after hitting a six. Aravinda de Silva was named man of the match, as he was in the semi-final.\nAustralian treble.\nThe 1999 event returned to England after sixteen years with some matches also held in Ireland, Scotland and the Netherlands. After losing two matches in the group phase, one of the favourites, Australia needed to avoid defeat in seven consecutive matches to win the title. They subsequently were required to defeat South Africa in the final Super Six match at Headingley. After South Africa had reached 271, Australia were struggling when captain Steve Waugh hit a ball straight to Herschelle Gibbs, who dropped it after trying to throw the ball into the air in celebration, eliciting the barb from Waugh that he had \"dropped the World Cup\". Waugh struck an unbeaten century to guide Australia to their target in their Super Six match against South Africa off the final ball of the match. Australia then faced South Africa again in the semi-final and posted a target of 213. South Africa needed nine runs from the final over with one wicket remaining, with man of the tournament Lance Klusener on strike. He struck the first two balls to the fence, leaving one run from the remaining four balls. However, a mix-up between Klusener and Allan Donald on the fourth ball saw Donald drop his bat and be stranded mid-pitch to be run out. The match was a tie, allowing Australia to advance to the final due to earlier results. In the other semi-final, Pakistan, who had qualified first in both the group and Super Six phase, defeated New Zealand by nine wickets. In the final Australia dismissed Pakistan for 132 and reached the target in just over 20 overs, with eight wickets in hand.\nSouth Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya hosted the 2003 Cricket World Cup. The number of teams participating in the event increased from twelve to fourteen. Because of political pressure and security concerns respectively, Zimbabwe and Kenya were awarded their matches against England and New Zealand respectively, after the latter teams forfeited the matches. Kenya's victories against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, among others, along with New Zealand's forfeit helped them get a Semi-final berth against India, the best result by an associate. India went on to defeat the Kenyans to set up a final against Australia in Johannesburg, who had defeated Sri Lanka in the other Semi-final. In the final, Australia made 359 runs for the loss of two wickets, the largest ever total in a final, to defeat India by 125 runs.\nIn 2007 the tournament was hosted by the West Indies; the Cricket World Cup became the first such tournament to be hosted on all six populated continents- Europe (1975, 1979, 1983, 1999); Asia (1987, 1996); Australasia (1992); Africa (2003); North and South America (2007). Ireland making their World Cup debut tied with Zimbabwe and defeated Pakistan to progress to the second round, where they went on to defeating Bangladesh to get promoted to the main ODI table. Following their defeat to Ireland, the Pakistani coach Bob Woolmer was found dead in his hotel room; contrasting reports from different sources say that he was either murdered or died of natural causes. Australia defeated Sri Lanka in the final by 53 runs (D/L), in farcical light conditions, extending their undefeated run in the World Cup to 29 matches and winning three straight World Cups.\n2011.\nThe 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup was the tenth Cricket World Cup. It was played in India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. India won the tournament, defeating Sri Lanka by 6 wickets in the final at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, thus becoming the first country to win the Cricket World Cup final on home soil. India's Yuvraj Singh was declared the man of the tournament. This was the first time in World Cup history that two Asian teams had appeared in the final. It was also the first time since the 1992 World Cup that the final match did not feature Australia.\nHistorical formats of final tournament.\nThe number of teams in and the format of the final tournament has varied considerably over the years. In summary:\nEarly format.\nThe format of the Cricket World Cup has changed greatly over the course of its history. The first four tournaments had eight teams each, divided into two groups of four teams each. There were two stages, a group stage and a knockout stage. In the 1975 and 1979 Cricket World Cups, each team played a round-robin, while in the following two tournaments, each team played the rest in their group twice. The top two teams in each group played the semi-finals and the winners of the semi-finals played against each other in the final.\nTrial formats.\nIn the 1992 Cricket World Cup, all teams played each other once. The top four qualified for the knockout stage which was contested in similar fashion to the previous events. In the 1996 Cricket World Cup, the number of teams increased from nine to twelve and were divided into two groups. The top four teams of each group qualified for the knockout stage this time, which also included quarter-finals.\nSuper stage era.\nThe 1999 Cricket World Cup tournament had a similar group stage format, but there were dramatic changes in the second stage with a \"Super Six\" round replacing the quarter-finals. There were still two groups of six but only three teams from each group went into the subsequent stage. In the Super Six round, each qualifier from Group A played against each qualifier from Group B. The teams earned points from their wins in the Super Six and also brought points scored against the two other teams who qualified from the same group in the group stages. The top four teams from the Super Six played the semi-finals and the rest of the tournament followed in similar fashion to its predecessors. The 2003 event had a similar structure to the 1999 competition. The number of participants rose to fourteen, with seven teams in each pool in the group stage. The Super Six qualifiers also carried forward one point for each win in the group stage against non-qualifiers, a complexity which was dropped for the next world cup.\nThe 2007 Cricket World Cup featured 16 teams allocated into four groups of four. Eleven teams having One Day International status qualified automatically for the tournament while the other five teams were selected from the ICC Trophy. Within each group, the teams played each other in a round-robin format and the top two teams advanced to the \"Super 8\" round. The eight remaining teams then played in a round-robin format, except that they did not play the other team that advanced from their respective group. The top four teams from the Super 8 round advanced to the semi-finals and the winners of the semi-finals then contested the final.\nReturn to a Quarter-Final format.\nIn 2007, the Super 8 Round suffered from lack of crowds as a result of the tournament being too long (24 matches), but also due to big teams like India and Pakistan being knocked out of the tournament in the Group Stage.(2007 Cricket World Cup.) As a result, the ICC decided to exclude 2 teams from the 2011 tournament – dividing 14 teams into two groups of seven from which the top 4 teams from each group qualified for the Quarter Finals, this resulted in the addition of more matches into the earlier stages of the tournament as opposed to the second stage. Also adding more knockout matches (seven as opposed to the three in 2007) to increase interest in TV audiences."

        "title": "Cricket World Cup hosts",
        "text": "The International Cricket Council's executive committee votes for the hosts of the tournament after examining the bids made by the nations keen to hold the Cricket World Cup. All of the World Cup events so far have been held in nations in which cricket is a popular sport. Most of the tournaments have been jointly hosted by nations from the same geographical region, such as Europe (mainly the United Kingdom) in 1975, 1979, 1983, 1999 and 2019; Asia (mainly South Asia) in 1987, 1996, 2011 and 2023 (and also scheduled in 2031); Oceania in 1992 and 2015, Africa (mainly Southern Africa) in 2003 (and also scheduled in 2027) and the West Indies in 2007.\nEngland have hosted the most World Cups – a total of 5 (including the first three World Cups). England has hosted the most number of World Cup alone, doing it in 1975 and 1979. In 1983 &amp; 2019, despite being regarded as the only host for the tournament, some matches were played in Wales, while in 1999, some matches were played in Ireland, Netherlands, Scotland along with Wales. India are the second nation to host the world cup alone in the 2023 edition. The West Indies hosted the tournament in 2007 but are not considered as sole hosts because the West Indies represents a sporting confederation of 15 mainly English-speaking Caribbean countries, British dependencies and non-British dependencies.\nHosts Selection.\n1975, 1979 and 1983 Cricket World Cups.\nEngland hosted the first three competitions. The ICC decided that England should host the first tournament because it was ready to put the resources needed in organising the inaugural event. India proposed that it should host the third Cricket World Cup, but most ICC members believed England was a more suitable venue because longer period of daylight in June. This meant that a match could be completed in one day.\n1975, 1979 and 1983† Host: \n1987 Cricket World Cup.\nThe first competition hosted outside England was the 1987 Cricket World Cup, which was jointly held in India and Pakistan. A change in location led to a reduction in the number of overs from sixty to fifty in each innings because of the shorter duration of daylight.\n1987 Hosts: and \n2007 Cricket World Cup.\nThe 2007 Cricket World Cup was awarded to the West Indies via the International Cricket Council's rotational policy. It was the first time the Cricket World Cup had been held in the Caribbean despite the fact that the West Indies cricket team had been the second most successful team in past World Cups. Bermuda and the United States unsuccessfully bid for the right to host matches.\n2007 Hosts: \n2011, 2015 and 2019 Cricket World Cups.\n2011 Bids:\nThe ICC originally announced its decision which countries would host the 2011 World Cup on 30 April 2006. Australia and New Zealand's bid for the tournament was the only bid for 2011 delivered to ICC headquarters in Dubai ahead of the 1 March deadline.\nICC President Ehsan Mani said the extra time taken by the Asian bloc to hand over its bid compliance book had harmed the four-nation bid. However, when the time came to vote, Asia won the hosting rights by ten votes to three. The Pakistan Cricket Board revealed that it was the vote of the West Indies Cricket Board that swung the matter, as the Asian bid had the support of the four bidding countries along with South Africa and Zimbabwe. It was reported in Pakistani newspaper Dawn that the Asian countries promised to hold fund-raising events for West Indian cricket during the 2007 World Cup, which may have influenced the vote. However, chairman of the Monitoring Committee of the Asian bid, I. S. Bindra, said it was their promise of extra profits in the region of US$400 million that swung the vote, that there \"was no quid pro quo for their support\", and that playing the West Indies had \"nothing to do with the World Cup bid\".\nAfter missing out on 2011, Australia and New Zealand were awarded the 2015 World Cup. England was awarded the 2019 event as part of rotational policy.\n2011 Voting Result:\n2011 World Cup moved out of Pakistan.\nWorld cup moved out of Pakistan by the ICC on 17 April 2009 due to ongoing concerns about the \"uncertain security situation\" prevailing in the country, especially in the aftermath of the 2009 attack on the Sri Lanka national cricket team in Lahore\nOn 9 April 2009, PCB chairman Ijaz Butt revealed that they had issued a legal notice to oppose ICC decision. However, the ICC claims that PCB is still a co-host and they have only shifted the matches out of Pakistan. Pakistan had proposed that South Africa host the 2015 World Cup and Australia/New Zealand host 2011, however this option did not find favour with their co-hosts and hence didn't materialise.\n2011 Hosts: , and \n2015 Hosts: and \"awarded after losing the 2011 hosting bid.\n2027 and 2031 Cricket World Cups.\nOn 16 November 2021, ICC published the name of the hosts for ICC events to be played between 2024 and 2031 cycle. The hosts for the 50-over World Cup including T20 World Cup and Champions Trophy were selected through a competitive bidding process overseen by a sub-committee chaired by Sourav Ganguly, former president of the BCCI, Ricky Skerritt, president of Cricket West Indies and Martin Snedden.\nUnofficial rotation system.\nSince the 1983 World Cup in England, an unofficial rotation system was introduced so that each cricket playing region of the world would have the opportunity to host World Cup after every twenty years. However, according to the \"Sydney Morning Herald\", \"The Age\" and Cricinfo, owing to the increasing power and role of the Asian nations, particularly India, this convention has not been strictly adhered to. For example, according to the rotation system, Australia and New Zealand should have been hosts for the event in 2011. But, the subcontinent won the bid because it would fetch additional US$ 400 million in profit."

        "text": "At the end of each ICC Cricket World Cup final tournament, several awards are presented to the players and teams which have distinguished themselves in various aspects of the game.\nAwards summary.\nThere are currently four post-tournament awards:\nGolden Bat.\nThe \"Golden Bat\" Award goes to the top run scorer of the ICC World Cup. While every World Cup had a ranking of the run scorers, the first time an award was given was in 1975. If there is more than one player with the same number of runs both of them are awarded with the Golden Bat. India is the only country whose players have won the Golden Bat a record 5 times (Sachin Tendulkar in 1996 &amp; 2003, Rahul Dravid in 1999, Rohit Sharma in 2019 and Virat Kohli in 2023).\nGolden Ball.\nThe \"Golden Ball\" Award goes to the top wicket taker of the ICC World Cup. While every World Cup had a ranking of the wicket takers, the first time an award was given was in 1975.\nIf there is more than one player with the same number of wickets both of them are awarded with the Golden Ball.\nHistory.\nFor a long period of time prior to the Cricket World Cup, awards were handed out to players for their performance in each match. These player's were named the Man of the Match. This trend continued into the Cricket World Cup. To receive a Man of the Match award in the final generally meant that one had put up a match-winning performance for their team and, in essence, won their team the World Cup.\nSince 1992, at the end of the World Cup, one player is declared as \"Man of the Tournament\".\n1975 Cricket World Cup.\nMan of the Final Match\n1975 – Clive Lloyd – 102 runs from 85 balls\nThe 1975 Cricket World Cup was the first World Cup. The final was between the Australian cricket team and the West Indies cricket team.

A lower order batting collapse took the West Indies to 6/209 before the tailenders combined to achieve the total of 291.\nThe Australians began their chase on track, with brothers Greg Chappell and Ian Chappell taking them to 2/115. However, the Australian innings collapsed when Lloyd ran out Ian Chappell and subsequently took the wicket of Walters. Australia took their score to 274 all out and West Indies won the match. Fittingly, captain Clive Lloyd was named Man of the Match.\n1979 Cricket World Cup.\nMan of the Final Match\n1979 – Viv Richards\nIn the 1979 Cricket World Cup, the West Indies were once again in the final, this time against England. England won the toss and sent the West Indies in to bat. The West Indies dropped to 3/55 and later 4/99 before Viv Richards and Collis King combined for a 139 run partnership before King was dismissed for 86. Richards remained and continued to score with the tail, who were all dismissed for ducks. Richards remained on 138 not out and the West Indies ended on 9/286.\nRichards bowled 10 overs economically and ended with figures of 0/35 as England began a slow and steady chase to the West Indies' target. However, the English team inexplicably collapsed from 2/183 to 194 all out to give the West Indies the world cup for the second time in a row. Viv Richards was named man of the match.\n1983 Cricket World Cup.\nMan of the Final Match\n1983 – Mohinder Amarnath – 3/12 and 26\nThe 1983 Cricket World Cup Final was on a pitch considered very difficult to bat on. The final was between the Indian cricket team and the West Indies. With the West Indies sending India in to bat. India's star batsman Sunil Gavaskar was out early in the innings as India fell to 1 wicket for 2 runs as Mohinder Amarnath came in to bat with Kris Srikkanth. The two managed to combine to form a gritty partnership which ended at 2/59 when Srikkanth fell. Amarnath still remained and took India to 2/90 before losing his wicket. He scored 26 off 80 balls. India were all out for 183, with only three batsmen, one of them Amarnath, crossing the 20-mark.\nThe West Indies began in similar fashion but a top-order collapse saw them fall to 6/76 through the bowling of Madan Lal and Kapil Dev. However, from there on the pair of Jeff Dujon and Malcolm Marshall combined to take the West Indies past the 100 mark. However, Amarnath came in to bowl and took both of their wickets, leaving the West Indies at 8/124, before he trapped Michael Holding leg before wicket to take India to a 43 run victory. Amarnath had innings-best figures of 3/12 and he was commended for his all-round performance with the Man of the Match award. It is the lowest World Cup final score to be defended.\n1987 Cricket World Cup.\nMan of the Final Match\n1987 – David Boon – 75 runs\nThe 1987 Cricket World Cup Final was between England and Australia. Australia won the toss and elected to bat, sending in openers David Boon and Geoff Marsh. Australia got off to a very good start thanks to Boon's batting. Boon was part of a 75 run stand with Marsh and a 76 run stand with Dean Jones and took Australia to 1/150. Boon was out for 75 with Australia at 4/168 before Border and Veletta took Australia to 253 in the 50 overs. Boon was the only batsman to cross 50.\nIn the second innings, England ended at 246 with various Australian bowlers, namely Craig McDermott, Steve Waugh, Simon O'Donnell and Allan Border, sharing the wickets.

He averaged 114.00 and had scored 1 century and 3 fifties.\nMan of the Final Match\n1992 – Wasim Akram – 33 runs off 19 balls and 3 wickets\nThe 1992 Cricket World Cup Final was between Pakistan and England. Pakistan elected to bat first. After the openers failed to make an impact, Javed Miandad and Imran Khan carried the Pakistani innings through to 4/197, when Inzamam-ul-Haq was joined by Wasim Akram at the crease. Inzamam-ul-Haq hit 42 off 35 balls while Akram hit 33 off 19 balls before being run out on the last ball of the innings, taking Pakistan to 6/249 in 50 overs.\nEngland's innings started badly when Akram dismissed Ian Botham for 0. England drooped to 4/69 before some resistance was provided by Allan Lamb and Neil Fairbrother, who took England to 4/141 and within the hope of achieving the target. However, at this point Akram returned to the attack and dismissed Lamb for 31 and the next batsman, Lewis, for 0. England did not recover and was all out for 227.

After a score of just 6 against Zimbabwe. Jayasuriya performed better against India, helping Sri Lanka to victory with 79 off 76 balls. He went on to score 44 runs against Kenya and 82 against England. In the semi-final against India, Jayasuriya was out for 1 but contributed with the ball taking the wickets of Sachin Tendulkar, Sanjay Manjrekar and Ajay Jadeja. His wickets triggered a collapse which reduced India from 1/98 to 8/120 and took Sri Lanka to the final. Jayasuriya did not perform in the final, he scored just 9 and got 1/43 with the ball.\nAlthough other batsmen, including Sachin Tendulkar who scored a record 523 runs at an average of 87.16, scored more runs than him. Jayasuriya was awarded Man of the Tournament for his aggressive and exciting strokeplay and his match-winning qualities.\nMan of the Final Match\n1996 – Aravinda de Silva – 107 not out and 3/42\nThe 1996 Cricket World Cup Final was between Australia and Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka won the toss and sent in Australia to bat. Australia reached 1/137 in the 27th over with Mark Taylor and Ricky Ponting dominating proceedings.

When they both fell, Australia was at 6/202 with Ian Healy and Michael Bevan at the crease, De Silva bowled out Healy but Bevan persisted, taking Australia to 241/7.\nAustralia was forced to bowl in the foggy dew, but still shortened Sri Lanka's chances with quick dismissals of the openers, as Sri Lanka slumped to 2/23. Then De Silva came into the crease and played \"on the biggest occasion of his life, played with quite wonderful\njudgment\". He scored 107 from 124 balls, only the 3rd ever century in the World Cup final, and partnered with Asanka Gurusinha and Arjuna Ranatunga, to take Sri Lanka to what ended up an easy victory. De Silva was awarded the well-deserved Man of the Match.\n1999 Cricket World Cup.\nMan of the Tournament\n1999 – Lance Klusener – 281 runs (strike rate of 122) and 17 wickets\nThe all-rounder Lance Klusener was part of the South African team in a time in which it was very successful in One Day International cricket. He played 9 matches in the World Cup and almost made it 10 with his final overs cameo against Australia in the semi-final that went in vain as the match was tied. Klusener averaged 140.5 with the bat and 20.58 with the ball in this World Cup.\nKlusener opened his World Cup with a win against India in which he took 3/66 and made 12 not out. He continued his form in subsequent matches, scoring 52* and 3/21 against Sri Lanka, 48* and 1/16 against England, 5/21 against Kenya, 52* and 1/36 in a losing cause against Zimbabwe to carry South Africa through to the Super Sixes stage. In the Super Sixes, Klusener failed with the bat for the first time in the Cup, scoring only 4 against New Zealand, but he still took 2/46 with the ball. He scored 46* and took 1/41 against Pakistan and scored 36 and 1/53 against Australia in another losing cause. In the World Cup semi-final, Klusener came in when the score was 6/175, with the South Africans required 39 in 5 overs to win. Klusener scored 31 off just 16 balls and brought South Africa to the level of a tie, but then a run out with Allan Donald resulted in the match remaining tied and Australia passed through to the final per past results with Klusener remaining stranded not out.\nKlusener had a strike rate of 122, indicative of his quick-paced batting, but his average was higher than even his strike rate. While Rahul Dravid was the leading run-scorer (461) and Shane Warne was the leading wicket-taker (20). His all-around performance earned him the man of the series award.\nMan of the Final Match\n1999 – Shane Warne – 4/33\nThe 1999 Cricket World Cup Final was between Australia and Pakistan. Pakistan won the toss and elected to bat first. The openers were out early as Pakistan got to 3/68 at the 20th over. Australian leg spin bowler Shane Warne was brought into the attack and made impact, bowling out Ijaz Ahmed for 22 and having Moin Khan caught behind for 6, reducing Pakistan to 5/91 after 27 overs. Pakistan attempted to rebuild their innings through their long line of all-rounders, but Warne and Paul Reiffel eliminated the threat. Warne got the wickets of captain Wasim Akram and dangerous all-rounder Shahid Afridi. Pakistan was all out for 132 and Warne ended with 4/33.\nThe target was of no concern to the Australia team, winning by 8 wickets with 29.5 overs in hand, with Adam Gilchrist top scoring with 54. Warne was awarded Man of the Match for his match-winning bowling performance.\n2003 Cricket World Cup.\nMan of the Tournament\n2003 – Sachin Tendulkar – 673 runs and 2 wickets\nIndia was quite successful in the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Apart from making it to the final, they only lost two matches, both to champions Australia. One of the major reasons for this success was the record-breaking performance of \"Little Master\" Sachin Tendulkar. In 11 innings Tendulkar scored 673 runs at an average of 61.18. He started off his World Cup campaign with a 52 against the Netherlands and a gritty 36 against Australia while all else was collapsing. From that point on in the World Cup, he scored consistently. After an 81 and 152 against Zimbabwe and Namibia respectively, he scored 50 against England and 98 against Pakistan in what was the highest successful run chase in the whole World Cup. He failed to perform against New Zealand and Kenya in the Super Sixes, but scored 97 against Sri Lanka to seal a 180 run victory. He came back in the semi-final against Kenya to score 83. However, in the final, he did not perform, scoring only 4 against a mammoth Australia target.\nOut of his 11 innings, Tendulkar was unlucky to only get 1 century. He reached 98 against Pakistan and 97 against Sri Lanka before being dismissed. He also reached the 80s twice. In his 11 World Cup innings, Tendulkar scored 7 50+ scores. Tendulkar remains the record-holder of numerous records in World Cups.\nMan of the Final Match\n2003 – Ricky Ponting – 140 not out\nThe final of the 2003 Cricket World Cup was between India and Australia. India won the toss and sent Australia in to bat. The Australian openers wreaked havoc on the Indian pace bowlers and only Harbhajan Singh could take wickets. In the 14th over, Adam Gilchrist was dismissed by Singh and Ricky Ponting walked in to bat. Australia was 2–125 in the 20th over when Ponting was joined by Damien Martyn at the crease. Australia achieved 200 in just 35 overs. Martyn and Ponting held a 100 run partnership off just 109 balls. Australia achieved the highest partnership for this ground in ODIs. In the 41st over Australia achieved 250. Ponting then reached his century which included 5 sixes and Australia quickened the pace, scoring 110 runs in the next nine overs at 12.2 runs per over. Ponting scored 140, the highest in a World Cup final at the time and Martyn scored 88, his highest against India.\nIndia's start was not so dominating, Sachin Tendulkar being dismissed for just 4. India fell to 3/59 before Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag combined to take the total to 3/147. India reached 234 before they were all out in the 38th over. Ponting, Australia's captain, was awarded Man of the Match.\n2007 Cricket World Cup.\nMan of the Tournament\n2007 – Glenn McGrath – 26 wickets\nMan of the Final Match 2007 – Adam Gilchrist – 149 runs\n2011 Cricket World Cup.\nMan of the Tournament\n2011 – Yuvraj Singh – 362 Runs and 15 wickets\nYuvraj Singh of India had a great tournament. Even though he had a golf ball sized tumour around his lungs (that was later diagnosed as cancer) he played his heart out and very significantly helped win India the World Cup. He performed well with both bat and ball in almost all games he played in. He scored a half-century against England and The Netherlands. He impressed with the ball by picking up a 5 for against Ireland, whilst also scoring a half-century. His greatest contribution came against the West Indies, where he scored a hundred on a tough pitch and also picked up 2 wickets, helping India to reach the knockout stages. In the quarterfinals, he played a vital knock against Australia, scoring another half century and picking up 2 wickets. Though he failed to score in the semi-final against Pakistan, he replied with the ball, picking up the important wickets of Asad Shafiq and the experienced Younis Khan. In the final against Sri Lanka, he once again proved his allrounder capabilities, picking up 2 important wickets and providing a winning partnership with MS Dhoni to take India home to a historic win. He scored a total of 362 runs and picked up 15 wickets in the tournament.\nMan of the final match of 2011 Cricket World Cup: M S Dhoni\nMan of the Final Match 2011 – Mahendra Singh Dhoni with 91 (79) runs.\nSri Lanka started the innings slowly, constrained by good bowling from Zaheer Khan and committed fielding from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, and Virat Kohli inside the 30-yard circle. Zaheer began with three consecutive maidens and the wicket of Upul Tharanga, conceding only six runs in his five-over spell. Sri Lankan opener Tillakaratne Dilshan was bowled by Harbhajan Singh when a delivery carried on to the stumps after deflecting off his gloves. Captain Kumar Sangakkara came in after Tharanga's dismissal, and was building a solid foundation with Dilshan before the latter was dismissed. Mahela Jayawardene came to the crease when Sri Lanka were 60/2 in the 17th over. Sangakkara and Mahela went about the task of consolidating the innings, but eventually Sangakkara was caught behind by Dhoni at 48. New batsman Thilan Samaraweera was adjudged not out by the umpire when a ball hit his thigh pad off the bowling of Yuvraj Singh. The Indians decided to review the decision and he was ultimately given out. Chamara Kapugedera, who was playing his first World Cup match, was caught off a deceptive slower ball by Zaheer Khan. Jayawardene, meanwhile, continued with his quality batting, ultimately scoring 103 not out from 88 balls in a high-class batting display. Helped by the hard-hitting of Nuwan Kulasekara and Thisara Perera, Sri Lanka scored 91 runs in the last 10 overs, including 63 in the batting powerplay (45–50 overs) to take the score to 274/6\nIndia had a shaky start, with Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar both dismissed early by Lasith Malinga, leaving them struggling at 31 for two. Sehwag was trapped LBW for a duck on the second ball of the innings. Tendulkar started with some good strokes, racing to 18 off 14 balls, but then edged a catch to wicketkeeper Sangakkara. Virat Kohli and Gautam Gambhir started the recovery with some fluent stroke play and quick running between wickets, taking India to 114 before Kohli was caught-and-bowled by Tillakaratne Dilshan for 35. When he was on 30, Gambhir mistimed a shot off the bowling of Suraj Randiv, sending the ball high up in the air, but Nuwan Kulasekara could not hold on to a difficult chance at long off. Kohli and Gambhir put together an 83-run partnership before Kohli's dismissal. Dhoni came in after Kohli to bat at number five, usually the position of Yuvraj Singh. Both Kohli and Dhoni are right-handed batsmen, while Gambhir and Yuvraj are left-handed. Along with other considerations, by coming ahead of Yuvraj, Dhoni ensured there would be a right-left batting combination between him and Gambhir, which makes it difficult for the bowlers to get into a rhythm, and necessitates frequent field changes. Both Gambhir and Dhoni emphasised on preserving the wickets, and later accelerating with a greater flow of boundaries. Gambhir and Dhoni added 109 for the fourth wicket with Gambhir scoring 97. Gambhir tried to finish his century with a boundary, but his heaving bat failed to connect with the ball, and he was bowled by Thisara Perera. Following Gambhir's dismissal, 52 runs were required off 52 balls. Yuvraj Singh was the new batsman and along with Dhoni took India to victory, and Dhoni sealed the match hitting a six off Nuwan Kulasekara, when only 4 runs were required off 11 balls. Dhoni finished on 91 not out from 79 deliveries. Like in many other day-night matches in the subcontinent, dew started to form on the outfield grass in the night, making the ball damp and difficult to grip especially in the later part of India's batting. However, this was a known factor and was taken into consideration by the Sri Lankan captain when he chose to bat first after winning the toss. By crossing the target of 274, India had set a record for the highest successful run-chase in a World Cup final.\nAt the end of the match, the batting strength of both the teams stood out. The three top run scorers of this tournament were from these finalists: Tillekaratne Dilshan (500 runs), Sachin Tendulkar (482), and Kumar Sangakkara (465). In the top 10 tournament scorers, there were three from Sri Lanka (Upul Tharanga (395) in addition to the previous two), and four from India (Gautam Gambhir (393), Virender Sehwag (380), and Yuvraj Singh (362) in addition to Sachin).\n2015 Cricket World Cup.\nMan of the Tournament\n2015 – Mitchell Starc – 22 wickets\nThe Australian fast bowler was notable for his yorkers and wicket-taking deliveries in the World Cup. He started the World Cup by taking 2 wickets against England in the opening match. The highlights of the tournament of Starc was when made a big turnaround in the group match against New Zealand when took 6 wickets and four of them were bowled. Unfortunately, New Zealand won the game by 1 wicket. His form in the World Cup continued by taking wickets against Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and against Scotland where he took 4 wickets and was awarded the man of the match. In the knockout stages he took 2 wickets against Pakistan and 2 against India to take Australia to the final. He was very supportive by his fellow bowlers James Faulkner, Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Johnson. In the final Australia took on New Zealand at MCG where Australia started as favourites. In the first over of the final, New Zealand Captain Brendon McCullum was bowled for 0 by Mitchell Starc. It was the big moment of the final. Australia then went on to win the match by 7 wickets to become 5-time world champions. Starc was named as the player of the tournament for his outstanding bowling, yorkers and wicket-taking deliveries. He finished with 22 wickets and joint highest with Trent Boult for the most wickets at 2015 world cup.\n&lt;br&gt;\nMan of the Match of the Final\n2015– James Faulkner – 3 wickets conceiving 36 runs in 9 overs\n2019 Cricket World Cup.\nMan of the Tournament\n2019– Kane Williamson – 578 runs and 2 wickets (for his captaincy as well)\n&lt;br&gt;\nMan of the Match of the Final\n2019– Ben Stokes – 84* runs and 8* runs in Super Over\n2023 Cricket World Cup.\nMan of the Tournament\n2023- Virat Kohli - 765 runs and 1 wicket\n&lt;br&gt;\nMan of the Match of the Final\n2023- Travis Head - 0/4 and 137 runs\nThe final match of the Men's World Cup unfolded as a spellbinding spectacle within the hallowed confines of Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on the November 19, 2023. This grandiose event, steeped in the fervor of cricketing enthusiasm, beckoned an overwhelmingly Indian crowd bedecked in the team's iconic blue jersey. As India paraded onto their revered home turf, the air was charged with palpable excitement, fueled by the nation's impressive streak of 10 consecutive victories in the league matches and semi-final.\nThe toss, that critical crossroads in any cricketing narrative, assumed heightened significance on this dew-kissed evening. The renowned dew-friendly pitch saw Australia, having won the toss, opt to bowl first — a strategic move reflecting their acute comprehension of the pitch nuances and playing conditions.\nIndia Innings:\nThe initiation of India's innings, characterized by the tenacity of Powerplay 1 spanning 10 overs, featured Captain Rohit Sharma at the zenith of his flamboyant and dynamic batting prowess. Yet, at the precipice of 9.4 overs, the stadium bore witness to a pivotal turning point as Travis Head, executing a sensational catch off a Glen Maxwell delivery, dismissed Rohit Sharma, casting a spell of stunned silence upon the crowd. Despite this early setback, the Indian team exhibited unwavering resilience, with Virat Kohli, the talismanic batsman, shouldering the responsibility of steadying the ship.\nKohli's authoritative presence at the crease steered India to the 100-run milestone in 15.4 overs. However, the echoes of shock reverberated through the stadium at 28.3 overs when Australian Captain Pat Cummins dismissed bainsod Kohli, fulfilling a promise made in a pre-match press conference to relish the hush that befell the crowd. The audience, now enveloped in an eerie hush, bore witness to the disappointment that deepened with each passing delivery. The team reached 150 runs in 29.1 overs, progressing to the Drinks break at 162/4 in 32 overs, with Rahul on 45 and Ravindra Jadeja on 5.\nThe match underwent a decisive shift in the 35.4th over when Australia, with a successful challenge, led to Jadeja being declared out. Powerplay 2 unfolded with India scoring 117 runs, albeit with three wickets down. Despite a valiant effort during Powerplay 3, the innings concluded at 240/10 in 50 overs, with Mohammed Siraj contributing 9 runs. The Australian fielding, characterized by its immaculacy and precision, limited India to a mere 4 boundaries in the last 40 overs, amplifying the collective disappointment among Indian fans in the stadium.\nAustralia Innings:\nAustralia's innings commenced with Powerplay 1, a 10-over phase that witnessed them amass 60 runs at the loss of 3 wickets. The target set by India added an extra layer of pressure on the Australian side. However, their response during Powerplay 2 showcased unwavering resilience. As the Drinks break unfolded, Australia stood at 93/3 in 17 overs, with Travis Head on 40 and Marnus Labuschagne on 10.\nThe 4th wicket partnership between Head and Labuschagne added 50 runs in 70 balls, propelling Australia to the 100-run mark in 19.1 overs. Travis Head's half-century off 58 balls injected further momentum, with the partnership reaching 100 runs in 119 balls. Australia continued to build on this momentum, reaching the 150-run mark in 27.1 overs.\nA critical juncture unfolded in the 27.5th over when India challenged a decision. The umpire's call favored Australia, allowing Labuschagne to continue his innings. The crescendo of emotions reached its zenith when Travis Head achieved a brilliant century off 95 balls, marked by 14 boundaries and 1 six. At the Drinks break, Australia stood at 192/3 in 35 overs, with Head on 107 and Labuschagne on 41.\nAustralia reached the 200-run mark in 36.3 overs, with Labuschagne achieving his half-century off 99 balls. Powerplay 3, the final phase of the innings, was mandatory, and Australia successfully chased down the target.\nAs the final moments unfolded, Australia emerged victorious, dealing a poignant blow to the hopes of the predominantly Indian crowd. The disappointment was not confined to the stands; it permeated the field, with Indian team players visibly moved to tears. Captain Rohit Sharma and cricketing maestro Virat Kohli mourned not just the loss of the World Cup but, at the ages of 36 and 35 respectively, the realization that this might mark their final ODI World Cup as active playing squad members.\nThe heartbreak felt in the stands and on the field rendered the Men's World Cup final a poignant rollercoaster of emotions, unveiling the unpredictable nature of cricket and etching a lasting impact on the passionate Indian cricket fans. Their journey, laden with emotion, transcended the boundaries of sport, leaving an indelible mark on the collective spirit of cricket enthusiasts."

        "title": "Miami Hurricanes baseball",
        "text": "The Miami Hurricanes baseball team is the college baseball program that represents the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida. Since 1973, the program has been one of college baseball's elite with 25 College World Series appearances, winning four national championships (1982, 1985, 1999, and 2001) and advancing to the NCAA regionals a record 44 consecutive years, from 1973 to 2016. Miami has won 29 NCAA Regional Titles, hosted 27 NCAA Regionals, and in each of their four national championship runs they were an NCAA Regional Host.\nAlong with the university's other athletic teams, the baseball team became a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference during the 2004–05 academic year. Previously, the baseball program competed as an NCAA independent, even during the school's Big East Conference affiliation in other sports. Miami won its first ACC conference championship in baseball in the 2008 ACC Baseball Championship. In 2021, College Factual, based on a number of considerations, ranked the University of Miami the best college in the state of Florida for prospective NCAA Division I baseball players.\nThe Hurricanes play their home games at Alex Rodriguez Park at Mark Light Field on the University of Miami campus in Coral Gables. J.D. Arteaga is currently the head coach of the team.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1940 to 1962).\nThe University of Miami fielded its first varsity baseball team in the spring of 1940. Jack Harding, the school's head football coach, was charged with the task of putting together the first squad. The program's first game was played on March 3, 1940, at Miami Field, which was located on the southwest corner of the Miami Orange Bowl parking lot. The Hurricanes defeated Newberry, 13–12. The upstart team followed their first victory with 4 straight losses to finish their short, inaugural season with a record of 1–4.\nBaseball took a six-year hiatus on the Coral Gables campus until former football standout Eddie Dunn revived the program in 1946. Dunn led the Hurricanes to several winning seasons before leaving the program in 1954.\nThe relative stability the new program enjoyed under Dunn was followed by several years of coaching upheaval. The Hurricanes would see 4 different coaches in the next 8 seasons. The first of these coaches was Perry Moss, who came to Coral Gables in 1955. Moss led the team to a respectable record of 15–7 in his only season at the university. After leaving Miami, Moss would gain notoriety as a football coach in the NFL, CFL, AFL and the now defunct WFL and USFL.\nMoss was succeeded as head coach by MLB superstar Jimmie Foxx. Foxx was inducted into the Professional Baseball Hall of Fame in 1951 after a stellar career that included stops with the Athletics, Red Sox, Cubs and Phillies. His success as a player, however, didn't translate to wins for the Hurricane ballclub. Foxx coached two seasons at Miami compiling a record of 20–20.\nIn 1958, Whitey Campbell became the first former Hurricane player to assume the role of head coach. Campbell lettered in football, baseball and basketball as a student at the University of Miami in the 1940s. With the exception of the 1959 season, in which former coach and athletic director Jack Harding led the team, Campbell was the skipper of the Hurricanes through the spring of 1962. Campbell's teams never had a losing season in his four years as coach.\nRon Fraser era (1963 to 1992).\nRon Fraser arrived at the University of Miami in the fall of 1962 after spending three years as head coach of the Dutch National team. What was supposed to be a short three-month stint with the team turned into a successful run that included three European Championships.\nThe task of turning the Hurricanes into a winner on the diamond was a daunting one. Coach Fraser encountered a program with no money, no uniforms, and no scholarships. He also had to work days at the Coral Gables youth center to supplement his meager pay check from the university.\nRon Fraser's first game as skipper was a 4–3, extra inning loss to Ohio State on March 16, 1963. His first win came five days later as the Hurricanes defeated Army, 3–1. The team finished the year with a record of 18–9.\nIn their first seven seasons under the tutelage of Coach Fraser, the Hurricanes set school records for wins in 1964 (20), 1965 (23), 1968 (27) and 1969 (31). The program advanced to the postseason for the first time in 1971 when they competed in District III in Gastonia, North Carolina. The Hurricanes won their first game against Georgia Tech, 4–3 before losing to Mississippi State and then being eliminated by Georgia Tech, 5–3.\nFollowing another winning season in 1972, the baseball team received scholarships for the first time. The team had six scholarships in 1973 which resulted in the program's first 40-win season in school history. The next season Fraser was awarded six more scholarships which propelled his team to the championship game of the 1974 College World Series where they lost to USC, 7–3.\nMark Light Field at Alex Rodriguez Park.\nIn 1971, Fraser's dream of building an elite on campus stadium began to take shape. George and Ethel Light came forward to support the project by making the initial donation to the stadium fund. Opening night for the brand new stadium came on February 16, 1973. A crowd of 4,235 watched as the Hurricanes defeated Florida State, 5–1. The Hurricanes thrilled the overflow crowd by executing a rare triple play in the win over the Seminoles.\nGeorge and Ethel Light made a second donation in 1974, which was matched by other donors, in an effort to build permanent concrete seating at the new facility. The stadium was dedicated in 1977 and named for Light's son, Mark, who died of muscular dystrophy. Unfortunately, George Light didn't get to see the dedication of the stadium named for his son. He died in 1974 shortly after he and his wife made their second donation.\nAs the program improved, the crowds began to grow. The Hurricanes set single season attendance records in nine of the stadium's first 10 seasons. In 1973, the program averaged 848 fans a game. By 1982 average attendance had skyrocketed to 3,217. Miami led the NCAA in average attendance for 5 straight seasons beginning in 1981.\nIn 2003, New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez donated $3.9 million for stadium renovations. The stadium is now named in his honor. His donation, the largest ever to the Hurricanes' baseball program, aided in the building of a new clubhouse, weight room, training room, team meeting room, academic center, video room, press box and four VIP luxury suites. Other improvements in recent years included new dugouts and improved stadium lighting, restrooms and concession areas.\n1982 national championship.\nThe Hurricanes came close to winning the national championship in their first College World Series appearance in 1974. They followed up with 4 straight appearances from 1978 to 1981 before sweeping through the Atlantic Regional in Coral Gables en route to Omaha in 1982.\nMiami opened the College World Series with a 7–2 win over Maine. The Hurricanes followed up with a close-fought 2–1 victory over Texas. Miami's third game in Omaha had perhaps the most memorable play in the history of college baseball.\nIn what would come to be called the Grand Illusion, the Hurricanes used a hidden ball trick to pick off NCAA stolen base leader Phil Stephenson. In the 6th inning against powerhouse Wichita State, Stephenson took his usual lead from 1st base. Hurricanes pitcher Mike Kasprzak faked a throw to the bag. First baseman Steve Lusby dove to the ground then raced down towards the Hurricane bullpen where pitchers Dan Smith and Bob Walker leaped to avoid the ball. Stephenson set out for 2nd base as Kasprzak tossed the ball over to shortstop Bill Wrona for the tag. The Hurricanes swung the momentum in their favor and went on to win 4–3.\nIn the semifinal two days later against Maine, Miami pitcher Rob Souza threw a pickoff attempt over the head of Bill Wrona into center field. But the memory of the Grand Illusion kept the runner from trying to advance to third. Maine head coach John Winkin said, \"I thought it was another trick play.\" Miami rolled to a 10–4 victory that propelled them into the championship game against Wichita State.\nIn the championship game, Wichita State jumped out to an early 3–0 lead. In the top of the 5th, the Hurricanes scored 6 runs with the aid of a Phil Lane 3-run home run. Miami added a run in the 6th and 2 runs in the 8th before closer Dan Smith finished off the Shockers in the 9th for the Hurricanes first national championship. Smith was named College World Series MVP while Lane and catcher Nelson Santovenia were named to the all tournament team.\n1985 national championship.\nMiami was unable to reach Omaha to defend their championship in 1983. However, the Hurricanes reached the College World Series again in 1984 before bowing out after losses to Arizona State and Cal State Fullerton.\nThe Hurricanes reached the 1985 College World Series by beating Florida, 12–9 in the final game of the Atlantic Regional. Miami began play in Omaha by thumping Stanford, 17–3 before losing to Texas, 8–4 in game 2. The loss to Texas put the Hurricanes in the losers bracket. The Hurricanes responded by pulling off three straight one run victories over Oklahoma State, Mississippi State and Texas. The win over Texas forced a winner take all championship game between the Hurricanes and the Longhorns.\nIn a game delayed a full day by inclement weather, the Hurricanes jumped out to an early 2–0 lead and never trailed the rest of the way. Miami closer Rick Raether pitched the final 2.1 innings to finish off the Longhorns, 10–6, and give the Hurricanes their second national championship. Designated hitter Greg Ellena was named College World Series MVP while catcher Chris Magno and pitcher Kevin Sheary were named to the all tournament team.\nRetirement and legacy.\nRon Fraser led the Hurricanes to Omaha four more times before his retirement at the end of the 1992 season. In all, coach Fraser won 1,271 games while leading his team to the College World Series 12 times. He made the postseason 21 times in his 30 years as head coach and his teams never had a losing record during his tenure.\nCoach Fraser was known as the Wizard of College Baseball due to his creative and innovative promotions geared towards generating interest in the college game. Major League Baseball stars such as Stan Musial and Ted Williams headlined several events to help raise money for Fraser's program. In one instance, Fraser ventured to Bristol, Connecticut, to promote college baseball to the brass at ESPN. His efforts paid off as the sports television network broadcast several high-profile college baseball games on national television.\nIn 2006, Ron Fraser was inducted into the inaugural class of the College Baseball Hall of Fame in Lubbock, Texas.\nJim Morris era (1994 to 2018).\nUniversity of Miami athletic director Dave Maggard hired longtime assistant Brad Kelley to replace Ron Fraser. But after a subpar season and allegations that Kelley allowed under age drinking among his players on a road trip, he resigned. The new athletic director, Paul Dee, opened up a national search for his replacement. Among the finalists for the job were Long Beach State head coach Dave Snow, North Carolina State head coach Ray Tanner and Georgia Tech head coach Jim Morris.\nOn November 4, 1993, Jim Morris was named head coach of the Miami Hurricanes. In 12 seasons at Georgia Tech, Morris won 504 games and 4 straight ACC Championships. However, he never led the Yellow Jackets to a College World Series.

        "title": "Under-19 Men's Cricket World Cup",
        "text": "The ICC Under-19 Men's Cricket World Cup is an international cricket tournament organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC) contested by national under-19 teams. First contested in 1988, as the Youth Cricket World Cup, it was not staged again until 1998. Since then, the World Cup has been held as a biennial event, organised by the ICC. The first edition of the tournament had only eight participants, but every subsequent edition has included sixteen teams. Among the full members, India have won the World Cup on a record five occasions, while Australia have won four times, Pakistan twice, and Bangladesh, England, South Africa and the West Indies once each. New Zealand and Sri Lanka have reached tournament finals without winning.\nHistory.\n1988 (Winner: Australia).\nThe inaugural event was titled the McDonald's Bicentennial Youth World Cup, and was held in 1988 as part of the Australian Bicentenary celebrations. It took place in South Australia and Victoria. Teams from the seven Test-playing nations, as well as an ICC Associates XI, competed in a round-robin format. Australia lost only one match, their final round-robin game against Pakistan by which time they had qualified for the semis. They went on to beat Pakistan by five wickets in the final, thanks to an unbeaten hundred from Brett Williams. England and West Indies made up the last four, but India were the real disappointments. After opening with a good win against England, they suffered hefty defeats in four matches to be knocked out early.\nThe tournament was notable for the number of future international players who competed. Future England captains Nasser Hussain and Mike Atherton played, as did Indian spinner Venkatapathy Raju, New Zealand all-rounder Chris Cairns, Pakistanis Mushtaq Ahmed and Inzamam-ul-Haq, Sri Lankan Sanath Jayasuriya, and West Indians Brian Lara, Ridley Jacobs, and Jimmy Adams.\nAustralia's Brett Williams was the leading run-scorer, with 471 runs at an average of 52.33. Wayne Holdsworth from Australia and Mushtaq Ahmed were the leading wicket-takers, with 19 wickets at averages of 12.52 and 16.21 respectively.\n1998 (Winner: England).\nEngland were the unexpected winners of the second Under-19 World Cup in South Africa. In 1998, the event was relaunched in South Africa as a biennial tournament. The only previous tournament of its kind was held ten years earlier. In addition to the nine Test-playing nations, there were teams from Bangladesh, Kenya, Scotland, Ireland, Denmark, Namibia and Papua New Guinea. The teams were divided into four pools, named after Gavaskar, Sobers, Cowdrey and Bradman, and the top two sides from each progressed to two Super League pools, whose winners advanced to the final. In order to give everyone a decent amount of cricket, the non-qualifiers competed in a Plate League, won by Bangladesh, who beat West Indies in the final. West Indies failed to qualify for the Super League after a fiasco concerning the composition of their squad – they arrived with seven players who contravened the age restrictions for the tournament. The Super League, in which every game was covered live on South African satellite television, also threw up a number of shocks and tense finishes; both pools came down to net run-rate at the finish. England, from being down and almost out, beat Pakistan – who surprisingly lost all three of their games – but lost a rain-affected match to India. Australia had beaten India and Pakistan and were favourites to reach the final. Only a massive defeat by England could deny them: but that is precisely what they suffered. In front of a crowd of about 6,000 at Newlands, they were bowled out for 147. New Zealand joined England in the final, where a century from England's Stephen Peters won the day.\nChris Gayle was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 364 runs at an average of 72.80. West Indian Ramnaresh Sarwan and Zimbabwean Mluleki Nkala were the leading wicket-takers, with 16 wickets at 10.81 and 13.06 respectively.\n2000 (Winner: India).\nThe 2000 tournament was held in Sri Lanka, and replicated the format from 1998. Participating nations included the nine Test-playing nations, as well as Bangladesh, Kenya, Ireland, Namibia, Holland, Nepal and a combined team from the Americas development region. To the disappointment of a large crowd at Colombo's SSC, Sri Lanka fell at the final hurdle in a final dominated by India. The winners remained unbeaten throughout, and destroyed Australia by 170 runs in the semi-final to underline their supremacy. In the other semi-final, Sri Lanka delighted a crowd of 5000 at Galle by beating Pakistan. The fact that three of the four semi-finalists were from Asia and so more attuned to the conditions was coincidental – they played the better cricket and, in Pakistan's case, had a very experienced squad. England, the defending champions, were most disappointing, and they won only one match against a Test-playing country, and that a last-ball victory over Zimbabwe. South Africa, one of the favourites, were desperately unlucky to be eliminated after three no-results gave them three points while Nepal, with four points courtesy of one win over Kenya, went through to the Super League instead. The format of the tournament was as in 1997–98, with four groups of four and then a Super League and final. Graeme Smith was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 348 runs at an average of 87.00. Pakistan's Zahid Saeed was the leading wicket-taker, with 15 wickets at 7.60. India's Yuvraj Singh was named Man of the Series. India clinched the title for the first time under the captaincy of Mohammed Kaif.\n2002 (Winner: Australia).\nThe fourth Under-19 World Cup held in New Zealand only confirmed Australia's dominance of the game, and from their opening match, when they obliterated Kenya by 430 runs, through to their comprehensive victory over South Africa in the final, they were never threatened. Participating nations included the ten Test-playing nations, plus Canada, Kenya, Namibia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, and Scotland. Their captain, Cameron White, was singled out for praise for his leadership, and he chipped in with 423 runs at 70.50. And they didn't rely on pace either, playing only two seamers and four slow bowlers, with Xavier Doherty, a slow left-armer, leading the wicket-takers with 16 at 9.50 and all without a single wide. In contrast, India, the holders, underperformed in their semi-final against South Africa, a team they had easily beaten a week or so earlier. They also suffered embarrassing defeats to neighbours Pakistan and Bangladesh. Pakistan, however, provided the main upset when they lost to Nepal by 30 runs, and Nepal also gave England a few uneasy moments. Zimbabwe won the plate competition, with their expected opponents, Bangladesh, beaten in the semi-final by Nepal. Australian Cameron White was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 423 runs at an average of 70.50 and Xavier Doherty was the leading wicket-taker, with 16 wickets at 9.50. Tatenda Taibu, Zimbabwe's captain, was Man of the Series for his 250 runs and 12 wickets, not to mention his wicket-keeping in between bowling stints.\n2004 (Winner: Pakistan).\nThe 2004 tournament was held in Bangladesh. More than 350,000 spectators saw the 54 matches played in the tournament. The finale ended with a close final between the two best teams – West Indies and Pakistan. It was won by Pakistan by 25 runs against West Indies and a 30,000 crowd acclaimed the victorious Pakistanis almost as their own. The shock was the elimination from the main competition of holders Australia, bowled out for 73 and beaten by Zimbabwe in the group stage when Tinashe Panyangara took 6 for 31, the second-best figures in the competition's history. And Australia then lost to Bangladesh in the plate final amid thumping drums and gleeful celebrations. The downside was the quality of the cricket, which was often mediocre on some indifferent pitches, and the reporting of six unidentified bowlers for having suspect actions. Pakistan would have finished unbeaten but for a hiccup against England – when both teams had already qualified for the semis. England reached the last four, which was progress, and Alastair Cook looked a class apart. But they came unstuck against West Indies' spinners in the semi-final. India completed the semi-finalists. Shikhar Dhawan and Suresh Raina were the backbone of a strong batting line-up, and Raina's 90 from just 38 balls against the hapless Scots was as brutal an innings as one will see at any level. Both looked international-class already, though faced with a tough task breaking into their senior side's formidable top order. The captain Ambati Rayudu had been hailed as the next great batting hope, having scored a century and a double in a first-class match at the age of 17. But he did not score the runs promised and was banned by the referee John Morrison from the semi-final after allowing a funereal over-rate during the Super League win against Sri Lanka: eight overs were bowled in the first 50 minutes. India's Shikhar Dhawan was named Man of the Tournament, and was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 505 runs at an average of 84.16. Bangladeshi Enamul Haque was the leading wicket-taker, with 22 wickets at 10.18.\n2006 (Winner: Pakistan).\nThis tournament was always going to struggle to live up to the overwhelming response that greeted the previous event in Bangladesh. Despite free tickets the matches were sparsely attended even when the home side were in action, but it shouldn't detract from an impressive two weeks which finished with Pakistan securing their second consecutive title in an extraordinary final against India at the Premadasa Stadium. Pakistan crumbled to 109, but in a thrilling passage of play reduced India to 9 for 6. Nasir Jamshed, and Anwar Ali, two of the success stories of the tournament, did the damage and there was no way back for India who fell 38 runs short. These two teams and Australia were the pick of the sides and along with England – who surpassed expectation to reach the semi-finals after beating a talented Bangladesh side – made up the final four. A number of players caught the eye, notably Australia captain Moises Henriques, the Indian batsmen Cheteshwar Pujara – the tournament's leading run-scorer – and teammate Rohit Sharma, along with legspinner Piyush Chawla, who a few weeks later made his Test debut against England. However, perhaps the best story of the tournament was Nepal claiming the Plate trophy after a thrilling victory against New Zealand having also beaten South Africa during the event\n2008 (Winner: India).\nIt was the first time the tournament was held in an Associate Member country. The 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup was held in Malaysia from 17 February to 2 March 2008. Along with hosts, 15 other teams battled in 44 matches packed into 15 days across three cities. India, still smarting from the loss in the previous edition had reason to be upbeat with Tanmay Srivastava, a mature batsman who eventually finished as the tournament's leading run-getter, in their ranks. Australia and England had forgettable campaigns, coming up short against the big teams after making mincemeat of the minnows. Defending champions Pakistan were fortuitous to reach the semi-finals as their batsmen never really got going and, against South Africa in the semi-finals, Pakistan had to chase 261. New Zealand, boosted by Man of the Tournament Tim Southee, were impressive before losing to India in a narrow run-chase under lights and cloudy skies in the other semi-final. South Africa's captain Wayne Parnell had played a major role in ensuring their passage to the summit clash, picking up the most wickets in the tournament en route. But they had lost to India in the group stages and lightning did strike twice. India under the leadership of Virat Kohli, after being bowled out for 159, emerged triumphant by 12 runs under the D/L method and were crowned champions for the second time. \n2010 (Winner: Australia).\nThe 2010 Under-19 Cricket World Cup was held in New Zealand in January 2010. The tournament was hosted in New Zealand after the ICC took it away from Kenya on the flimsiest of reasons which ridiculed its own to spread the game. Kenya were further kicked by the ICC as their side was not allowed to participate as it had not won the African qualifying event – a weakened side had been fielded as at the time, as hosts, they did not need to qualify. As it was, New Zealand did a decent job but crowds were dismal and the group stages were as tediously predictable as in the senior tournament, with the better-funded big nations dominating. South Africa did beat Australia in a good match but a dead rubber. The competition came alive in the quarter-finals as West Indies beat England and Sri Lanka defeated South Africa. The best tie of the competition came when Pakistan beat fierce rivals India by two wickets with three balls remaining in a low-scoring match. The final between Australia and Pakistan was a rematch of the first tournament, and Australia won by 25 runs in a game where fortunes ebbed and flowed throughout.\n2012 (Winner: India).\nThe 2012 Under-19 Cricket World Cup was held in the Tony Ireland Stadium, Australia. Along with the ten test playing nations, Afghanistan, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Ireland, Scotland and Namibia also participated in this tournament. Australia lost against India in the final on 26 August 2012. India's third U19 World Cup meant they tied for the most wins with Australia. Sri Lanka could not go through into the last eight but won the Plate championship by defeating Afghanistan by 7 wickets. Reece Topley of England was the highest wicket taker whereas Anamul Haque of Bangladesh was the top run getter. India won the final against Australia with 14 balls to spare ank'lld 6 wickets remaining. Captain Unmukt Chand played a match winning knock of 111* not out in 130 balls with the help of 6 sixes &amp; 7 fours. Sandeep Sharma also excelled with four wickets under his belt.\n2014 (Winner: South Africa).\nThe 2014 Under-19 Cricket World-Cup was held in Dubai (U.A.E.) in 2014. It was the first time that U.A.E. had hosted an ICC event. Afghanistan was the only non-full member to qualify for the Quarter Finals. This was the first time that Afghanistan reached the last eight of this tournament, courtesy of their stellar performance against Australia in the group stage. In fact, this was the second time that a non-test playing nation qualified for the Super League/Quarter Finals, Nepal being the first one in the 2000 edition.\nIndia wobbled in the Quarter Finals against England and finally lost in the final over. This was the first semi-final berth for England in the last four editions. Pakistan beat England in the semis to reach its fifth Under-19 Final, becoming the first team to do so. South Africa beat Australia in the second semi-final. In a one-sided final, South Africa beat Pakistan and claimed its maiden U-19 World Cup title. Corbin Bosch, son of former South African cricketer late Tertius Bosch, was the Man of the Match in the finals and Aiden Markram was the Man of the Series. South Africa did not lose even a single match in the entire tournament.\n2016 (Winner: West Indies).\nThe 2016 Under-19 Cricket World Cup was held in Bangladesh. It was the eleventh edition of the Under-19 World Cup, and the second to be held in Bangladesh. On 5 January 2016, Australia announced that the Australian squad had pulled out of the tournament, citing security reasons. Defending champions South Africa were knocked out of the tournament in the group stage, with back-to-back defeats to Bangladesh and Namibia. This was the first time that two non-test playing nations – Nepal and Namibia – qualified for the Super League/Quarterfinals. The West Indies defeated India by five wickets in the final, claiming their first title. Bangladesh's captain Mehedi Hasan was named player of the tournament, while England's Jack Burnham and Namibia's Fritz Coetzee led the tournament in runs and wickets, respectively.\n2018 (Winner: India).\nThe 2018 Under-19 Cricket World Cup was held in New Zealand. India and Australia played in the finals at Mount Maunganui on 3 Feb 2018. It was the 12th Edition of the Under-19 World Cup. India defeated Australia by 8 wickets, with Manjot Kalra scoring a match-winning 101* under the captaincy of Prithvi Shaw . The Man of the match was awarded to Manjot Kalra, while player of the tournament was awarded to Shubman Gill. India now holds the most wins record in Under-19 World Cup.\nRahul Dravid is the head coach of this India Under-19 Team. Later he was appointed as India national cricket team head coach on Nov 2021\n2020 (Winner: Bangladesh).\nThe 2020 Under-19 Cricket World Cup was held in South Africa. The thirteenth edition of the Under-19 World Cup, and the second to be held in South Africa. The final was played between India and Bangladesh which Bangladesh won after defeating India by 3 wickets in the final match at Potchefstroom, South Africa, based on Duckworth Lewis Method on 9 Feb 2020. This was Bangladesh's first ICC Under-19 World Cup victory.\nIn the final, India, batting first gathered 177 runs before being all out. In reply, Bangladesh made a flying start as they scored 55 runs losing only a wicket in first 10 overs. Soon Indian leggie Ravi Bishnoi picked up four quick wickets as Bangladesh were 102 for 6 from 62/2 at the end of 25 overs. When Bangladesh were 163/7 at the end of 41 overs and the still needing 15 runs to win, rain arrives and the match was reduced to 46 overs with a revised target as per DLS method was seven runs needing from 30 balls. From thereon, Bangladesh did not take any unnecessary risks and scored the winning run with 23 balls to spare thanks to the innings of captain Akbar Ali and won their first ICC title by three wickets.\nTop performers of the tournament were both Indians in batting or bowling. Yashasvi Jaiswal scored 400 runs throughout the tournament while Ravi Bishnoi took 17 wickets.\n2022 (Winner: India).\nThe 2022 Under-19 Cricket World Cup was held in the West Indies. The fourteenth edition of the Under-19 World Cup, and the first to be held in Caribbean.

He caught 7 passes for 63 yards, most of which came in LSU's 49–10 victory over Louisiana Tech. \nIn Davis' sophomore year the Tigers failed to repeat their success of 2003. In spite of this Davis emerged as the Tigers' receiving leader with 43 catches for 659 yards. He scored his first touchdown in the Tigers 24–7 win over Vanderbilt. \nDavis played in 11 of the Tigers games in 2005, starting 5. He ranked third on the team with 35 receptions, for 559 yards and 2 touchdowns. The high point of his season came in the Peach Bowl where he caught 5 passes for 99 yards and a touchdown in a 40–3 win over Miami. \nAs a senior Davis doubled as a receiver and a punt returner. He finished the year with 56 catches for 834 yards and four touchdowns. He finished his career with four catches for 50 yards in the Sugar Bowl against Notre Dame in his home of New Orleans.\nProfessional career.\nSan Diego Chargers.\nDavis was drafted by the San Diego Chargers 30th overall at the end of the first round of the 2007 NFL draft.\nOn July 23, 2007, Davis agreed with the Chargers on a 5-year $11 million contract just before training camp. \nIf Davis played out the contract, it was worth $7.83 million with about $3.2 million in incentives.\nHe finished his rookie season playing in 14 games, with one start, making 20 receptions for 188 yards and one touchdown.\nDuring his second season Davis only played in four games due to an injury. He finished the season with four receptions for 59 yards.\nDavis was released by the Chargers on July 28, 2011.\nBuffalo Bills.\nDavis signed with the Buffalo Bills on August 4, 2011.

        "text": "The men's single sculls was a rowing event held as part of the Rowing at the 1912 Summer Olympics programme. It was the fourth appearance of the event. The competition was held from 17 to 19 July at Djurgårdsbrunnsviken. There were 13 competitors from 11 nations. Each nation could have up to two boats. The event was won by Wally Kinnear of Great Britain, the nation's second consecutive victory in the men's single sculls. The other three medal-winning nations were new to the podium in the event. Kinnear beat Everard Butler of Canada in the semifinals, while Belgium's Polydore Veirman prevailed over Mart Kuusik of the Russian Empire; Butler and Kuusik received bronze medals. Veirman earned silver after falling to Kinnear in the final.\nBackground.\nThis was the fourth appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nThe two favorites in the event were likely Wally Kinnear of Great Britain (the Diamond Challenge Sculls winner in 1910 and 1911) and Polydore Veirman of Belgium, who would win the European championship later in 1912. Another strong contender was Everard Butler of Canada, the top North American sculler and winner of the National Association of Amateur Oarsmen events in 1911 and 1912.\nAustralasia, Austria, Bohemia, Denmark, Finland, and the Russian Empire each made their debut in the event. Great Britain made its third appearance, most among nations, having missed only the 1904 Games in St. Louis.\nCompetition format.\nAs in 1908, the 1912 tournament featured four rounds of one-on-one races. Semifinal losers each received bronze medals. For the first time, the Olympic course used the now-standard distance of 2000 metres.\nResults.\nFirst round.\nHeat 1.\nKuusic nearly collided with Heinrich in the first heat, leading to a protest that resulted in the heat being re-rowed the next day; Heinrich was disqualified in the second running of the heat. Three of the heats were walkovers.\nHeat 5.\nIvan Schweizer of Bohemia is listed as starting in this heat in the Official Report; however, it appears he did not actually compete.\nQuarterfinals.\nMészáros crossed in front of Veirman in the first quarterfinal, resulting in a protest and the contest being held over. The second time, Veirman got an early lead and kept it throughout. Simonsen abandoned the competition, giving Butler a walkover in the second quarterfinal. Kuusic won the final quarterfinal by three lengths, despite having been the only quarterfinalist to have already rowed during the day, in his rematch against Heinrich."

        "text": "The 2002 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament concluded on March 31, 2002 when Connecticut (aka UConn) won the national title. The Final Four was held at the Alamodome in San Antonio on March 29–31, 2002. UConn, coached by Geno Auriemma, defeated Oklahoma 82-70 in the championship game.\nNotable events.\nAfter wins in the first three rounds, Connecticut faced Old Dominion in the Mideast regional finals. The opening 16 minutes were described as \"near-perfect\", as the Huskies hit over 90% of their shots (19 of 21) and too had a 49–28 lead. That 21 point margin would match the final margin, as the Huskies would move on to the Final Four. Sue Bird scored 26 points, a career high, and eleven assist. The team recorded 25 assists, which brought their season total to 811, a new NCAA season record.\nIn the other three regions all the number one seeds, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Duke all advanced to the Final Four. A dozen years earlier, Oklahoma attempted to eliminate the women's basketball program, but now the program had advanced to its first Final Four, and faced Duke in one semifinal game. Duke opened the game with a 13–7 run, but the Sooners responded with 12 consecutive points. Oklahoma managed to get to a 17-point lead in the second half, but Duke cut the lead to only two points with just under eight minutes to go. Oklahoma responded with a 16–3 run to take a decisive lead, and won the game 86–71 to head to the national championship game.\nIn the other semifinal, UConn faced Tennessee. Although Tennessee scored first, but that would be the last time they would lead. The Huskies responded, opened up an early lead, and extended it to 13 points at halftime. Connecticut extended the lead in the beginning of the second half, with a 24–11 run, and went on to hold the Lady Vols to 31% shooting. No Tennessee player scored in double digits; Kara Lawson led the team with nine points. The win extended the perfect season by Connecticut to 38 games, while marking the fourth time in the last five meetings that the Huskies had beaten the Lady Vols.\nIn the championship game, the Sooners were out rebounded and outshot, but did not give up. Oklahoma did not give up a single three point shot, the first time that has occurred in an NCAA title game, and the last time that would happen to the Connecticut team in any game for over a decade. With a minute and a half to go, the Huskies held a lead, but only six points. UConn had the ball, and despite having four seniors on the floor who would go 1,2 4 and 6 in the 2002 WNBA Draft, gave the ball to sophomore Diana Taurasi, who backed down Oklahoma's Stacy Dales then took a turn around jumper then went in, while Dales fouled Taurasi to foul out of the game. Taurasi hit the foul shot to extend the lead to nine points, and the Huskies would go on to be the first team in history to record two undefeated seasons, winning their third national championship.\nThe championship game attendance of 29,619 set the still-standing attendance record for an official game in women's basketball history. A 2023 exhibition between Iowa and DePaul held at Kinnick Stadium, home to Iowa football, had an attendance of 55,646.\nQualifying teams – automatic.\nSixty-four teams were selected to participate in the 2002 NCAA Tournament. Thirty-one conferences were eligible for an automatic bid to the 2002 NCAA tournament.\nQualifying teams – at-large.\nThirty-three additional teams were selected to complete the sixty-four invitations.\nBids by conference.\nThirty-one conferences earned an automatic bid. In twenty-one cases, the automatic bid was the only representative from the conference. Thirty-three additional at-large teams were selected from ten of the conferences.\n2002 NCAA tournament schedule and venues.\nIn 2002, the field remained at 64 teams. The teams were seeded, and assigned to four geographic regions, with seeds 1-16 in each region. In Round 1, seeds 1 and 16 faced each other, as well as seeds 2 and 15, seeds 3 and 14, seeds 4 and 13, seeds 5 and 12, seeds 6 and 11, seeds 7 and 10, and seeds 8 and 9.

        "title": "Philippine Basketball Association draft",
        "text": "The Philippine Basketball Association draft is an annual event dating back to 1985 in which the twelve teams from the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) can draft players who are eligible and wish to join the league. The draft usually takes place between October and December, during the league's off-season. No player may sign with the PBA until he has been eligible for at least one draft.\nEligibility.\nAll players have to be natural-born Filipinos. Persons who chose Philippine citizenship by the age of maturity are considered as natural-born citizens.\nFor local players the requirements are that they:\nFilipino-descended foreigners have almost the same requirements as locals except they must:\nAny person who played for the Philippines men's national basketball team is exempted from the D-League and is automatically eligible for selection. The changes in eligibility rules are in effect starting in the 2015 draft. For the 46th season's draft held on March 14, 2021, the PBA decided to forgo the seven-game requirement after the 2020 PBA D-League Aspirants' Cup was cancelled.\nImports – non-Filipino citizens, even those born in the Philippines – do not enter the PBA via the draft. They are directly signed by teams, and only play in some conferences. Naturalized citizens can only play in the association also as imports.\nStarting with the 48th season's draft in 2023, the following changes were implemented:\nOrder.\nThe natural drafting order is determined by the teams' final rankings within each conference from the previous season, with rankings from the PBA Philippine Cup having heavier weight; the team with the worst record picks first, and the team with best winning percentage picking last in the first and second rounds.\nThe drafting order is also subject to change if a team deals their draft picks in trades. The draft is finished if all teams have passed.\nDraft lottery.\nBefore 2015, a draft lottery determined which team gets the first overall draft pick, but in a much smaller scale; only the two worst-performing teams in the preceding season participated. The team with the worst record had a 67% chance of clinching the No. 1 seed while the second-worst only got a 33% chance. The lottery was usually held prior to the finals of the final conference of the season. It was abandoned after the controversies that aroused during the lottery for the first pick of the 2014 draft.\nNumber of rounds.\nFrom 1985 to 2004 and since 2011, the PBA has had unlimited number of rounds until all the teams have passed, with all undrafted players becoming free agents.\nFrom 2005 to 2010, the association limited the draft to two rounds. This restriction was attributed to an agreement between the PBA and the Philippine Basketball League (PBL), which also included a development fee to the PBL team from which the player was drafted. This was removed in 2011 as the PBL had folded, and amateur players played in the PBA D-League instead.\nExpansion draft.\nThere have been three expansion drafts in the league's history. The first was in 1990, in which the new teams Pepsi Hotshots and the Pop Cola Sizzlers selected up to six players from the expansion pool, which is made up of three players from each of the six existing franchises. The second was in 2000, when newcomers Batang Red Bull Energizers selected players from the draft.\nAn expansion draft for new teams Blackwater Elite and Kia Sorento was held on July 18, 2014, so that both team can form its rosters for the 2014–15 season. The 10 existing PBA franchises protected up to 12 players in their roster. Two time MVP Danny Ildefonso of the Meralco Bolts was selected as the first pick of the expansion draft by Blackwater, followed by Reil Cervantes of Barako Bull by Kia.\nCarry over amateurs.\nIf a new franchise also has an existing franchise from an amateur league (from the Philippine Basketball League before 2011 and the PBA D-League afterwards), the franchise, upon approval from the PBA's Board of Governors, may be given an incentive of selecting players from their amateur team to be directly elevated to their PBA team. This was last given to the Welcoat Dragons, who elevated three players from their PBL team.\nList of first overall picks.\nFlags indicate the country where the player competed as college student-athletes; all players are Filipinos until proven otherwise, like Sonny Alvarado's case where he fled the country as his citizenship was being questioned."

        "title": "MGM-18 Lacrosse",
        "text": "The MGM-18 Lacrosse was a short-ranged tactical weapon intended for close support of ground troops.\nIts first flight test was in 1954 and was deployed by the United States Army beginning in 1959, despite being still in the development stage. The program's many technical hurdles proved too difficult to overcome and the missile was withdrawn from field service by 1964.\nHistory.\nDevelopment.\nThe Lacrosse project began with a United States Marine Corps requirement for a short-range highly accurate guided missile to supplement conventional field artillery. The Navy's Bureau of Ordnance issued contracts to both the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory in September 1947, for the study of design aspects pertaining to this mission. Initial planning involved a missile which could be fired from a ship or land launcher. Preset guidance would guide the missile until terminal guidance by a forward observer could take over. Then command guidance would be used to provide a circular probable error of not more than .\nThe missile system was named the Lacrosse because it employed a forward observation station which had a direct view of the target. The forward observation station was mounted on a jeep and after the missile was launched control was passed to the forward station for final guidance to the target. Hence the name Lacrosse which is how the game of lacrosse is played with the ball being passed to players closer to the goal.\nProject Lacrosse was established by the U.S. Marine Corps in 1947 at the Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University (APL/JHU). Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, Inc. was selected for the initial study and later became the prime contractor. Initially progress was slow and by 1949 the missile had grown from a derivative of the Lark missile to a much larger weapon carrying a warhead. Sight Tracking, Electronic Equipment Ranging (STEER) guidance was selected.\nIn Late 1949 the Joint Chiefs of Staff established a policy assigning Army Ordnance responsibility for short-ranged surface-to-surface missiles. As a result, in early 1950, the project was transferred from the Navy to the Army's Ordnance Corps and Redstone Arsenal. Cornell and Johns Hopkins continued with the project, with the former having primary responsibility for guidance systems design. The Lacrosse project went from exploratory to development of a weapon in mid-1951.\nDuring the next years the Lacrosse system was plagued by funding restrictions, and unsolved technical problems which caused schedule slippage and costs. These caused user criticism and loss of confidence in Lacrosse as a practical weapon system. A serious deficiency in coordination by the Office, Chief of Ordnance Corps inhibited development during the mid-1950s.\nIn 1955, the Glenn L. Martin Company was awarded contracts to participate in research and development and production. Martin would take over much responsibility for the project, as Cornell moved to work on expanding the missile's capabilities beyond the original requirements (particularly in the area of airborne control, funding for which was discontinued in 1959).\nEarly testing began in 1954 and production prototypes were available the next year. The difficulties encountered by the project are illustrated by the protracted design and testing periods, with the missile not entering into service until July 1959. Problems included reliability concerns and difficulties with guidance, particularly susceptibility to Electronic countermeasure jamming of the guidance signals.\nIn 1956, the Federal Telecommunications Laboratory began work on a different guidance system, known as MOD 1, which would have improved Lacrosse's performance with regards to electronic countermeasures. MOD 1, however, was terminated in 1959, causing the Marines to withdraw their participation in the project.\nLacrosse was briefly stopped in Fiscal Year 1957 and reinstated 1958 though without funding for production engineering. This funding situation was responsible for many of the deficiencies of Lacrosse I which was fielded. The first units received Lacrosse in 1959, though the system would continue to be in need of development and refinement.\nThe Lacrosse weapons system was composed of a large number of vehicles and systems aside from the missile itself. There were three trucks, and a jeep, in the firing unit. There was also an extensive forward guidance system composed of a radar, four Missile Guidance System units, and several other units including a 45 kW generator. There was also a large Maintenance section composed of four trucks with trailers. An extensive test program of the final system was mounted at White Sands. During the final development phase in 1958 and 1959 Martin fired 59 missiles. The Artillery Board fired from 1958 to 1960. The Systems Test Division fired 55 from 1958 to 1960. Finally the Army user fired 23 missiles in early 1960. Cold weather testing was conducted at Fort Churchill, Canada in 1958–1959. Despite the many problems and deficiencies the system was improved and accepted for service in mid-1959. Ultimately the Lacrosse would achieve an accuracy of between 0.9 and 2.1 meters, which was far better than the original objective.\nFrom mid-1959 production of Lacrosse systems were maintained on or ahead of schedule. Though training had been in planning since the mid-1950s severe deficiencies existed for the first 18 months when the Lacrosse system was deployed. Deployment was to ultimately include one Battalion for training in the United States, seven Battalions were deployed in Europe and one in Korea.\nEfforts at improvement of the Lacrosse system continued in 1960 but problems, especially with Electronic Counter Measures continued to plague Lacrosse. On January 4, 1961 the ax fell and the Lacrosse program was established at 3 reduced strength battalions in Europe, 1 in South Korea and 4 in the USA. Inventory was reduced to 95 per battalion from 120 by the end of 1962. Fiscal Year 1962 saw the effective end of the Army's experience with the Lacrosse system. Mary Cagle described the Lacrosse as \"technically deficient and unacceptable to the user for which it was developed.\" In her official Army history of the program she also stated that it was \"a victim of financial anemia and acute indecision and inaction.\nNearly 1,200 Lacrosse missiles were produced and deployed at a cost of more than US$2 billion in 1996 dollars (excluding the cost of the nuclear warheads).\nService.\nThe first unit to be equipped with Lacrosse was 5th Battalion, 41st Artillery, based at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. In total, eight battalions would be equipped with Lacrosse, with most going to Europe, except one to Korea and one retained by the Strategic Army Corps.\nDesignations.\nThe original Navy project was assigned the designator SSM-N-9. When transferred to the Army, the program became SSM-G-12, which changed to SSM-A-12 after minor changes in the Army's designation scheme. When adopted into service, the weapon system was referred to as M-4 and only gained its MGM-18A designation months before being declared obsolete."

        "text": "The men's coxed four was a rowing event held as part of the Rowing at the 1912 Summer Olympics programme. It was the second appearance of the event, which had been held at the 1900 Summer Olympics but had been replaced by coxless four at the 1904 and 1908 Games. The standard coxed four event allowed for outriggers, while another event was held in 1912 for boats with inriggers. The competition was held from 17 to 19 July 1912.\nFifty six rowers (11 boats) from nine nations competed. Germany replaced their coxswain, maybe the Danish \"Polyteknisk\" replaced a rower, but this possible change is not counted.\nStarting list.\nThe following boats and/or rowing clubs participated:\nBackground.\nThis was the second appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The coxed four was one of the four initial events introduced in 1900. It was not held in 1904 or 1908, but was held at every Games from 1912 to 1992 when it (along with the men's coxed pair) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nAt these Games, club teams competed rather than representative national sides. Ludwigshafener Ruderverein, a German club that earned bronze in 1900, was the only team to return (with an entirely new crew) from the Paris Games. Italian (1909 and 1910) and Swiss (1911 and 1912) crews had won the last four European championships, but did not compete in Stockholm. The favourites among the competing teams were Ludwigshafener and the British Thames Rowing Club, winners at Henley in 1909 and 1911.\nAustria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Great Britain, Norway, and Sweden each made their debut in the event. France and Germany competed for the second time, having appeared at the only previous edition in 1900.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed four event featured five-person boats, with four rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). It was the first Games to use the 2000 metres distance, which has been used ever since except at the 1948 Games.\nThe tournament featured four rounds of competition, with no repechages. Each race was head-to-head, with the winner advancing and the loser eliminated. There were 13 boats entered, so 7 heats were scheduled in the first round (including one bye); 2 boats withdrew, so 3 of the 7 heats ended up being walkovers. The quarterfinals featured 4 heats, again including one bye. There were 2 semifinals and 1 final.\nResults.\nFirst round.\nAll heats were held on Wednesday, 17 July.\nHeat 1.\n6.20 p.m. The Danish boat raced without opponent.\nHeat 2.\n6.40 p.m. \nHeat 3.\n7 p.m. \nHeat 4.\n7.20 p.m. \nHeat 5.\n7.40 p.m. \nHeat 6.\n8 p.m. \nHeat 7.\n8.20 p.m. \nQuarterfinals.\nAll quarterfinals were held on Thursday, 18 July.\nQuarterfinal 1.\n12.20 p.m. \nQuarterfinal 2.\n12.40 p.m. \nQuarterfinal 3.\n1 p.m. \nQuarterfinal 4.\n1.20 p.m. The German team had no opponent.\nSemifinals.\nBoth semifinals were held on Friday, 19 July.\nSemifinal 1.\n1.30 p.m. \nSemifinal 2.\n2 p.m. \nFinal.\nThe final was held on Friday, 19 July at 5.30 p.m. "

        "text": "The men's coxed fours with inriggers, also referred to as the coxed four with jugriggers, was a rowing event held as part of the Rowing at the 1912 Summer Olympics programme. It was the only appearance of the restricted event. The competition was held on Wednesday and Thursday, 17 and 18 July 1912. Thirty rowers from four nations competed.\nStarting list.\nThe following boats and/or rowing clubs participated:\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nAll quarterfinals were held on Wednesday, 17 July 1912.\nQuarterfinal 1: 11 a.m. Both boats got well away, the Norwegians leading for the first hundred metres or so. Then the Swedish, who were rowing a somewhat quicker stroke, began to creep up, and soon passed their opponents, obtaining a lead which they retained for the rest of the race. The winning crew pulling from 32–38 a minute, the Norwegian stroke varying between 28 and 38. Both boats were very well rowed, and it was physical strength that gave Sweden the victory.\nQuarterfinal 2: 11.20 a.m. At the start, Sweden led with an energetic stroke of 36, while the Danes rowed a longer but very effective stroke, which they used to perfection. The forward half of the stroke was one of extraordinary length, with a fine finish and excellent carriage of the hands. The way the crew rowed like one man was beyond all praise, and the four showed that it fully deserved its great reputation. The Swedish crew also made a very good impression and was only a little worse than its Danish rival; most noteworthy, perhaps, was the energetic stubbornness with which the Swedes defended the lead they succeeded in gaining at the start. The Danish crew was in better training, however, and the Swedes were not able to maintain their position when the Danes – who had the inner curve at the bath-house – began their spurt. Surely and irresistibly the Danish boat came up to, and passed, the Swedish, which, although at Djurgård Bridge, it had the advantage of the inner curve, could make no use of its position, but was beaten by one and a half length.\nQuarterfinal 3: 11.40 a.m. The two crews kept side by side for only 100 metres, the Norwegians then taking the lead and keeping it, without once being challenged by their rivals.\nSemifinals.\nBoth semifinals were also held on Wednesday, 17 July.\nSemifinal 1: 5.40 p.m. The Norwegians at once took the lead, which they kept for the first of the course, rowing 32–36 to the 34 of the Swedes. Halfway, the Swedish boat crept up to ist rival and, from the bath-house to the post, there was a most desperate struggle for victory, which was decided in favour of the home-crew by an energetic spurt at the last moment.\nSemifinal 2: 6 p.m. The crew rowed over in beautiful style, but without opponent.\nFinal.\nThe final was held on Thursday, 18 July.\nFinal: 7.30 p.m. Both crews rowed nicely and evenly, keeping side by side, until the 1,000 metres mark was reached, when the Danish crew, exhibiting perfect style and great physical power, began to take the lead. The Swedish crew was somewhat handicapped by the circumstance that some of the men had taken part in a punishing race against \"New College\" in the men's eight competition the same day, and Carl Møller was not at all in form, owing to a bad boil on one of his legs. Consequently, they had little hope of winning when, before the bridge was reached, the Danes began a final spurt, which gave them the race by a clear length. The Danish crew can be taken as the model of perfect rowing in inriggers, and its well-deserved victory was greeted by everyone – not least by its Swedish opponents – with hearty cheers."

The competition was held from Wednesday to Friday, 17 to 19 July 1912. Ninety-nine rowers (11 boats) from eight nations competed. Nations were still permitted to have two boats each in the event. \nThe event was won by the Leander Club of Great Britain, successfully defending their 1908 Olympic title. Silver also went to Great Britain, with their second boat from New College Boat Club. Germany earned its first medal in the men's eight with a bronze by the Berliner Ruderverein von 1876 (\"Berlin rowing club of 1876\"). \nAccording to the records of silver medallists New College, the final featured controversy as Leander's team acted outside convention over a coin toss, though this is not mentioned in the official record.\nBackground.\nThis was the fourth appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's eight has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nThe defending Olympic champion was the Leander Club of Great Britain. Leander's rowers came primarily from Magdalen College, Oxford. Magdalen had won the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley in 1910 and 1911. The other British boat came from another Oxford college, the New College Boat Club.\nCanada was represented for the third time by the Argonaut Rowing Club of Toronto, the silver medalists in 1904 and bronze medalists in 1908. The Argonauts had won the 1911 National Association of Amateur Oarsmen title.\nA notable absence was Belgium's Royal Club Nautique de Gand; Belgium had won the 1910 European Rowing Championships and the Gand club had won the 1909 Grand Challenge Cup, as well as having taken silver at the 1908 Olympics. The United States again did not compete.\nAustralasia and Sweden each made their debut in the event. Canada made its third appearance, most among nations to that point.\nStarting list.\nThe following boats and/or rowing clubs participated:\nCompetition format.\nThe \"eight\" event featured nine-person boats, with eight rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). For the first time, the Olympic course used the now-standard distance of 2000 metres.\nThe 1912 tournament featured four rounds of one-on-one races; with 11 boats in the competition, there were 5 contested heats and 1 walkover in the first round. The six boats advancing from the first round competed in three quarterfinals. The semifinal round had only one contested race, with the loser receiving bronze; the other semifinal was a walkover. The final determined the gold and silver medals.\nResults.\nFirst round.\nThe heats were held on Wednesday, 17 July.\nHeat 6.\nThe Swedish boat raced without opponent.\nQuarterfinals.\nAll quarterfinals were held on Thursday, 18 July.\nSemifinals.\nBoth semifinals were held on Friday, 19 July.\nSemifinal 1.\nThe New College team raced without opponent, but \"gave the spectators a good opportunity of seeing the pure English style of rowing, with its firm grip of the water and the quiet, almost stealthy recovery.\"\nFinal.\nThe final was held on Friday, 19 July, between the two British teams, from the Leander Club and from New College, Oxford. \nAccording to New College records, the race featured controversy, over a coin toss for choice of lanes. (The official rules required that the lanes be chosen by drawing lots.) The two lanes of the Djurgårdsbrunnsviken course were said to be markedly different, with a clearly better lane. According to New College tradition, lanes were chosen by coin toss, but the winner of the coin toss would offer the choice to the other boat, which would politely decline; yet when New College won the toss, Leander did not decline but instead chose the better lane. When Leander won the final, New College stroke Robert Bourne, angry over the choice, supposedly said \"God damn bloody Magdalen\" (referring to the Oxford college from which most of the Leander team hailed). At the medal ceremony, King Gustaf V is said to have presented his colors to New College (though the gold medals and Challenge Trophy went to Leander); the New College Boat Club has since used the supposed Swedish Royal House colors of purple and gold. New College has also taken \"God damn bloody Magdalen\" as a toast and put the abbreviation \"GDBM\" on its letterhead.\nThe official record makes no mention of any controversy, reading simply:"

After three full seasons in Binghamton, Komadoski was invited to the training camp of the St. Louis Blues, who eventually assigned him to their AHL affiliate, the Peoria Rivermen. After the 2007–08 season Komadoski had to retire due to a knee injury.\nEarly life.\nNeil Komadoski Jr. was born in Chesterfield, Missouri, in 1982. His father Neil Sr. played professional hockey and his mother Lauren was a stay at home mom. He has one sister Kelly who was an excellent figure skater until she injured her foot and could no longer compete. Growing up he lived and breathed hockey. He played for the St. Louis AAA Amateur Blues where his father coached him. He went on to high school where he attended two years at Chaminade College Preparatory in St. Louis. After his sophomore year he lived with a host family in Ann Arbor, Michigan where he continued his dream and hockey career. He graduated from Pioneer High school. As a sixteen-year-old in 1998-99 he was playing on the USA 18 and under National team in the North American Hockey League. Here he played 49 games and scored 3 goals with 11 assists which tallied a total of 14 points on the season. The following season he played for the US Junior National team in the United States Hockey League. He played in 50 games and hit the back of the net 7 times while helping with 8 to give him a total of 15 points.\nUniversity of Notre Dame.\nKomadoski was recruited by several universities but chose to attend the University of Notre Dame which played in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association. As a freshman, he scored 2 goals and had 5 assists. His rookie season got off to a slow start due to a shoulder injury in just the second game of the season and he missed nine games. His first career goal came against Bowling Green. As a sophomore, he played in all 38 games and scored just 2 goals and had 9 assists for 11 points. This is the year he was drafted but chose to stay in college and get an education before playing professional ice hockey. His junior season he picked up his game. While playing in all 40 games he led the Irish defenseman in scoring with a goal and 23 assists. Also his during his junior year, he was invited to the NCAA Leadership Conference held in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. This is one of the largest non-competitive gatherings of NCAA student-athletes. The conference is designed to enhance student-athletes' leadership and communication skills and to enable them to become more effective leaders and motivators when they return to their campuses. In his final season as a member of the Fighting Irish, Komadoski played in 39 games and scored 5 goals and had 10 helpers for 15 points. He was not only an outstanding athlete he also excelled in the classroom and was named to the Dean’s list twice. Also he was selected as one of 14 nominees for the College Hockey Humanitarian Award as a senior.\nProfessional career.\nAt the end of Neil’s senior season, he made his professional debut with the AHL Binghamton Senators, playing three games to finish the 2003-04 season. In his first full professional season, Komadoski played in 36 games that season, scoring two goals and adding one assist as a rookie. In the 2005-06 season Neil played in 41 games and tallied 5 assists but failed to score. He also added 71 penalty minutes. The following season which was the 2006-07 season he dressed out for 68 games. He scored 3 goals and had 4 assists which gave him a total of 7 points on the year. Over the years he had been progressing and hoping for a chance to make it to the NHL. After the 06-07 season ended he was a free agent and he signed a one-year contract with his hometown St. Louis Blues. In the 2007-08 he only played in three games with the Peoria Rivermen, the Blues affiliate in the AHL, due to a knee injury that would end his hockey playing career. He is currently an NHL scout for the Vancouver Canucks."

        "text": "The men's artistic individual all-around was an artistic gymnastics event held as part of the Gymnastics at the 1912 Summer Olympics programme. The competition was held on 12 July at the Stockholm Olympic Stadium. It was the fourth appearance of the event. There were 44 competitors from 9 nations. Each nation was limited to 6 gymnasts (a marked reduction from the 20 permitted in 1908). The event was won by Alberto Braglia of Italy, the first man to successfully defend a title in the artistic individual all-around. The bronze medalist from 1908, Louis Ségura, this time took silver. Braglia and Ségura were the first two men to win multiple medals in the event. Italian Adolfo Tunesi earned bronze.\nAs in 1908, the individual results were \"not\" considered for any of the team competitions. As in 1900 and 1908, there were no separate apparatus events.\nBackground.\nThis was the fourth appearance of the men's individual all-around. The first individual all-around competition had been held in 1900, after the 1896 competitions featured only individual apparatus events. A men's individual all-around has been held every Games since 1900.\nFour of the top 10 gymnasts from the 1908 Games returned: gold medalist Alberto Braglia of Italy, bronze medalist Louis Ségura of France, sixth-place finisher Samuel Hodgetts of Great Britain, and seventh-place finisher Marcel Lalu of France. Marco Torrès of France (1909) had won a World Championship since the last Games; reigning (1911) World Champion Ferdinand Steiner of Bohemia did not compete in Stockholm.\nDenmark, Luxembourg, and the Russian Empire each made their debut in the event. Bohemia, France, Great Britain, Hungary, and Italy each made their third appearance, tying the absent Germany (missing the event for the first time) for most among nations. Germany, Sweden, and Norway had gymnasts competing in the team events, but opted not to have individual gymnasts; Sweden and Norway cited their view that gymnastics should be a team sport with mass displays. \nCompetition format.\nGymnasts competed on the horizontal bar, parallel bars, rings, and pommel horse. Three judges marked each performer in each of the four apparati; these 12 scores were summed to give a final score. The scoring was from 0 to 12; this led to a possible total of 36 on each apparatus and 144 for the grand total.\nSchedule.\nTwo three-hour sessions were held on a single day, from 9:30 to 12:30 and from 14:00 to 17:00.\nResults.\nResults are listed in the order that they appeared in the Official Olympic Report, rather than the Olympic Order that exists today."

        "text": "The Australian cricket team toured Pakistan in the 1988–89 season. The teams played three Tests and 3 ODI's. Pakistan won both series 1 - 0. Javed Miandad and Bruce Reid were declared Man of the Series.\nSummary.\nThe first test was held in Karachi and quickly caused controversy, with Australian spinner Tim May having three LBW appeals turned down against Javed Miandad on the first day on his way to 211 and a first innings score of 9/469d, before Australia would suffer an innings defeat after collapsing to 165 in the first innings and 116 in the second after Pakistan enforced the follow on. \nThere was furore in the Australian camp as they perceived the umpiring to be biased towards Pakistan, this was not the first time umpiring standards had been questioned as the English team had also complained on their own tour the year previous and Imran Khan who did not play in this series, had called for neutral umpires for a tour of Pakistan in 1986 as there had been continued arguments that the Pakistani umpires were biased, a vote amongst the Australian team was held on if to continue the tour, with only Tony Dodemaide and Jamie Siddons voting to continue. \nAlthough intervention from the Australian board ensured the tour would continue under protest. This protest would later be removed as the tour continued. The remaining matches were played out with Pakistan winning the test and ODI series 1-0 each. Pakistan would tour Australia the following year and there would also be questions about the umpiring, this time being biased towards Australia. Giving further strength to the idea of neutral umpires, which would be implemented by the ICC for all test matches from 1994.\nAustralian squad.\nThe Australian squad selected was as follows:\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nIn the first Test, Javed Miandad scored 211, while Iqbal Qasim took 9 wickets.\n2nd Test.\nIn the second Test, Ijaz Ahmed and Javed Miandad scored 122 and 107 for Pakistan, while Allan Border scored 113 for Australia.\n3rd Test.\nIn the third match, Javed Miandad became the first batsman for Pakistan to score 7,000 runs in Tests. It was also the only time that Steve Waugh opened the bowling in each innings in a Test.\nODI series.\nPakistan won the ODI series 1–0. The first match, scheduled for 30 September 1988, at the Jinnah Stadium in Gujranwala was abandoned due to the ground flooding. The second match, originally scheduled to be played at the National Stadium in Karachi on 14 October 1988, and the third one-day match, scheduled to be played at Niaz Stadium in Hyderabad on 15 October 1988, were both abandoned as well due to riots. As a result, the scheduled rest day of the Lahore Test was cancelled and a one-day international scheduled for 13 October for Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. That match as then played a day later.\nThe only one day match to be played resulted in a tied game, with both teams scoring 229 in the 45 over match. However, since Australia lost 1 more wickets (8 to 7), Pakistan was declared winners of the match.\nTour Matches.\nAustralia also played three 3-day first class tour matches against BCCP Patron's XI at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on 5 September 1988, Baluchistan Governor's XI at the Ayub National Stadium in Quetta on 9 September 1988 and against North West Frontier Province Governor's XI at the Arbab Niaz Stadium in Peshawar on 2 October 1988.\nAll three matches were drawn.\nExternal sources.\nCricinfo\nCricketArchive"

Australia's Test team were touring South Africa, and the Board, determined that the Sheffield Shield season should not be further affected by the absence of leading players, stipulated that no current Sheffield Shield players would be allowed to tour India.\nThe finance for the tour was provided by The Maharaja of Patiala, and the team was selected and organized by the Australian cricketer Frank Tarrant, who had long playing experience in Australia, England and India. The team's official title was \"His Highness the Maharaja of Patiala's Team of Australian Cricketers\".\nThe Australian team.\nThe team chosen consisted largely of former Test players and fringe Sheffield Shield players. The players, with their ages at the start of the tour in late October 1935, were:\nAs well, Frank Warne (29) played in three of the first-class matches, Frank Tarrant (54) and Joseph Davis (age unknown) each played in two, and Tarrant's son Louis (31) played in one. The Maharaja of Patiala also played in one match for the Australians, as guest captain against Patiala, who were captained by his son, the Yuvraj of Patiala.\nThe tour.\nThe tour began in October 1935 in Colombo with one first-class match against Ceylon which the Australians won by an innings and 127 runs.\nFrom November 1935 to February 1936, the team played 16 first-class matches in India, including four matches against an All-India XI:"

They played a Prince's XI, four zone teams and three matches against an Indian XI. These three games were played, respectively, at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay; Eden Gardens in Calcutta; and M. A.

        "text": "The Australia national cricket team toured Ceylon and India in the last three months of 1969. The team, captained by Bill Lawry, played five Test matches against India, captained by the Nawab of Pataudi Jr. The Australians also played first-class matches versus each of the five Indian Zone teams: Central, North, West, East and South. In Ceylon, they played one first-class game against Ceylon and three minor matches. Australia won the Test series in India 3–1 with one match drawn. It was to be Australia's last Test series win in India until Ricky Ponting and Adam Gilchrist's side's victory in the 2004-05 series.\nSeries lead up.\nAustralia came into the series with a win under its belt against Garfield Sobers' West Indians at home the previous season. They had also retained The Ashes by drawing the 1968 series in England. Prior to the Australians' arrival, India had just managed to draw its home series against New Zealand by drawing the deciding Third Test because of rain; India had been 7/76 chasing 268.\nFirst class games.\nThe Australian cricket team played three minor matches in Ceylon before the first-class fixture against the Ceylonese national team on 24 October; the game was drawn. Australia's first match in India was against West Zone, a three-day match, from 31 October to 2 November, also ending in a draw.\nThree-day match: West Zone vs Australians.\nAustralia won the toss and elected to bat on a \"greenish than usual\" wicket. The Australians declared after scoring 340/7 in their first innings with captain and opener Bill Lawry scoring the highest, 89. In reply, West Zone captain Chandu Borde scored an unbeaten 113 before declaring after taking the score to 344/6. Ian Chappell for the Australians attacked the West Zone in their second innings, scoring eleven boundaries in his 84, taking the team's score to 150/2 at the end of third and final day's play.\nThree-day match: South Zone vs Australians.\nElection to bat first after winning the toss, South Zone ended day one at 204/7. An out-of-form Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi scored 10 runs in 70 minutes before being dismissed by Australians' pacer Laurie Mayne. After captain M. L. Jaisimha declared his team's innings after they made 239, batting 55 minutes into day two, Australians got off to a strong start. Captain Bill Lawry scored 120, including three sixes, putting on 90 runs for the first wicket with Ian Redpath, who made 29. Subsequently, a middle- and lower-order batting collapse saw the team dismissed for 195. South Zone's second innings started off poorly losing two wickets for 13 runs at the end of the day's play. Declaring at 155/6, Australia were set a target of 200 runs in 170 minutes. The Australians were reduced to 53/8 in their second innings with EAS Prasanna picking up six wickets. Annoyed by defensive batting by Lawry and John Gleeson for the ninth wicket, the crowd began to hurl stones into the ground, following which the match was abandoned as a draw, with the score at 90/8, four minutes from close of play. It was reported by \"The Statesman\" that Australians' captain Bill Lawry and players Ian Redpath and Graham McKenzie allegedly assaulted \"some Indian Press photographers\" following the match, which was later denied by Australia team manager Fred Bennett.\nTest series.\nFirst Test.\nThe first Test was scheduled between 4 and 9 November. It was originally scheduled to be played in Ahmedabad, but was moved to Bombay due to communal riots in the city. India won the toss and batted first in front of a 40,000 strong packed stadium. Openers Dilip Sardesai and Farokh Engineer lost their wickets to a quick Graham McKenzie after a good start. Having lost three wickets for 42, Ashok Mankad (74), who was promoted up the order, and Pataudi (95), put on 146 runs, then a record stand against Australia for the fourth wicket, after being dropped once each. A subsequent middle- and lower-order collapse took the score from 202/4 at the end of day one to 271 all out shortly after lunch on day two. McKenzie finished with 5/79.\nLawry and Stackpole started off cautiously for Australia against paceman Syed Abid Ali and the spin attack. Resuming after a rest day, Stackpole reached his century at tea, and his team 322/7 by the end of the day's play. Wickets fell in quick succession the following morning, day four, to India's spinners and were all out 345. Prasanna picked five wickets, while Bedi picked three and Venkataraghavan, two.\nIndia's top-order was dismissed cheaply in the team's innings, with Gleeson picking four of the five wickets. Post-lunch Gleeson managed to dismiss Pataudi for a duck and Chandu Borde for 8 reducing India to 59/5. Only Wadekar could offer any resistance and went on to bat for three-and-a half hours scoring 46 runs. The last hour of the day's play was marred by violence by a section of the crowd, in disapproval of umpire Sambhu Pan's decision when he declared Venkataraghavan out caught by wicket-keeper Brian Taber off Alan Connollys delivery. Play was however allowed to carry on despite bottles being hurled on the ground and chairs and canvas coverings being set on fire. The scorers request to abandon play for the day, for reasons that they could not see the signals of the on-field umpires and that they were \"blinded\" by smoke, was denied, when the score was 120/8. Later, the score kept by the All India Radio (AIR) commentators' box of the rest of the day's play which ended at 125/9 was accepted by the captains of the two teams. A. A. Jasdenwala, President of the Cricket Club of India that owns the stadium, decided to ban radio commentary for the following day holding one of the commentators responsible for instigating the violence. He revoked following an appeal by the AIR. India added 12 runs to the total the following morning before the final wicket fell. Set with a target of 64 in 283 minutes, Australia lost their openers for 13 runs. Australia reached the target a few minutes after lunch with Chappell and Doug Walters at the crease.\nSecond Test.\nGoing into the game, India made four changes: batsmen Borde and Sardesai, and bowlers Surti and Abid Ali were dropped for Eknath Solkar and debutante Gundappa Viswanath, and Subrata Guha, Ashok Gandotra respectively, while including Ambar Roy as the twelfth man. Australia retained the team from the first Test. India captain Pataudi won the toss and opted to bat first. Mankad and Engineer got the team off to a strong start completing a 100-run partnership in 96 minutes, first for the team since January 1967. An aggressive Engineer was dismissed caught and bowled by Stackpole off his first ball, after making 77, which included 12 fours. Mankad scored his half-century when he cut Gleeson for a four after lunch, before getting out in similar manner for an Ashley Mallett delivery. Viswanath followed him without scoring a run. Including Viswanath, Alan Connolly dismissed Wadekar and Gandotra, in a display characterized by accuracy, reducing India to 197/5. India batted to stumps without further loss, ending at 237/5. On resumption of play the following day, India lost wickets at regular intervals including Pataudi in the second over to Graham McKenzie, and the lower-order to Connolly and Ashley Mallett before winding up at 320. Australia's first innings began with a 48-run stand for the first wicket before Lawry was caught at short leg by Solkar off Venkataraghavan. Stackpole was run out for 40 a few minutes later before Chappell was done in by a topspinner off Venkataraghavan. Australia closed at stumps on 105/3.\nAn aggressive Doug Walters struck 8 fours before losing his leg stump to a delivery from Bedi that straightened, the morning after a rest day, after he made 54. Ian Redpath, and Paul Sheahan, who till had had an ordinary tour, put on 131 for the fourth wicket. Scoring at a-run-a-minute, the innings of both batsmen were marked by strokeplays, hitting 11 and 20 fours respectively, while batting for three hours together. Sheahan reached his maiden Test century before being dismissed for 114. The tail quickly followed before the side were all out for 348, with a lead of 28 runs, when stumps were drawn. India's openers showed no trouble against Australia's pacemen McKenzie and Connolly, following which captain Lawry introduced spinner Gleeson. Mankad continued after Engineer dismissed for 21. He was bowled by a yorker off McKenzie after making 68 in 202 minutes; the latter also dismissed Pataudi in his next over for a duck reducing India to 125/4. Solkar and Viswanath struck a partnership and batted India to stumps. Viswanath reached his century the following morning, becoming only the sixth to score one on debut. It was characterized by \"sound technique, mature judgement, superb footwork and wristy strokeplay.\" He batted for 354 minutes and the innings included 25 fours. His partner Solkar made 35, before the captain declared at 312/7 setting Australia a target of 285 runs in 130 minutes. Openers Lawry and Stackpole batted a full 130 minutes without losing a wicket, thus drawing the match.\nThird Test.\nOn 27 November, an agreement was reached between the Television Centre and the Delhi &amp; District Cricket Association (DDCA), and it was decided that the match would be televised, the first for a Test played in India. According to the agreement, the centre was to pay the DDCA 2,000 per match-day. The wicket was described as \"bald and barren\" and \"tailor-made for batsmen\", and that spinners would play a \"decisive role\". Prior to the match, Australia captain Lawry had said that if he won the toss his team would win the match and that he hoped it would rain if he lost the toss. He added that he hoped to go fishing before scheduled close of the match, to which India captain Pataudi responded saying the former \"will have [no] time\" for it.\nAustralia won the toss and opted to bat first. India included Ambar Roy in place of Ashok Gandotra. Australia started off strongly making 28 runs in 20 minutes, which included Stackpole's 3 fours off Subrata Guha. Guha struck in his fourth over, minutes later, when he bowled Lawry out as he tried to drive him. Chappell settled down quickly before Bedi and EAS Prasanna were brought into the attack. Chappell edged a turning delivery off Prasanna to Solkar at backward short leg when he was on 12, but was put down. Australia went to lunch at 84/1. They lost their second wicket in Stackpole at 100, who was stumped off Bedi. His 61 off 145 minutes included 7 fours and 1 five. While Chappell reached his half-century in 162 minutes, two wickets fell at the other end in the form of Walters and Redpath and later Sheahan, reducing his team score to 133/5. Chappell and Taber, the new batsman, went to tea without losing their wickets. A few minutes after tea, Chappell completed his fourth century and second against India, coming in 231 minutes. He put on 118 for the sixth wicket with Taber before losing his wicket to Bedi for 138. Mallet followed him after a few minutes and the team went to stumps at 261/7. The remaining wickets fell quickly the following morning and were all out at 296.\nA century from Ian Chappell took Australia to 296, and then Ashley Mallett spun India out for 223, taking 6-64. However, Bishan Bedi and EAS Prasanna then took five wickets each in Australia's innings and had the tourists out for just 107, leaving India with a target of 181 for victory. Ajit Wadekar's 91 set up India's victory by seven wickets, which saw the series locked at 1-1 going into the fourth and Fifth Tests.\nFourth Test.\nThe fourth Test started on 12 December and Australia won the toss, electing to field. McKenzie took 6-67 for Australia and ensured India's dismissal for 212. Half-centuries from Chappell and Doug Walters gave Australia a lead of 123, Bedi's 7-98 preventing a bigger Australian lead. In the second innings, Alan Connolly and Eric Freeman helped remove India for 161 and Australia needed only 42 for victory; they won by 10 wickets. Six people were killed and thirty were injured when police fired into a crowd who rushed the ticket counters before the start of the fourth day.\nFifth Test.\nThe fifth Test began on 24 December with India needing a victory to draw the series. Batting first, Australia made 258, largely through Walters's 102, and then dismissed India for 163. However, an Indian fightback in the second innings saw Australia reduced to 6/24 at one point before Ian Redpath rescued the innings for Australia, scoring 63. Australia were all out for 153, setting India 249 for victory. Mallett took his second five-for in the match and helped Australia dismiss India for 171, Australia winning by 77 runs.\nAshley Mallett ended up being the leading wicket taker of the series with 28 wickets at an average of 19.10; the second most successful bowler was Bishan Bedi with 21 at 20.57. The leading run scorer was India's GR Viswanath with 334 runs at 47.71; Australia's Ian Chappell was the next most successful batsmen with 324 runs at 46.28.\nAftermath.\nThe tour was to be Australia's last successful series in India until victory under Ricky Ponting and Adam Gilchrist in 2004-05. Between those series, Australia were unsuccessful on tours in 1979-80, 1996–97, 1997–98, and 2000–01; the 1986-87 tour was drawn 0–0 with the First Test a tie. India turned out to rebound from the loss by winning its next two series in the West Indies and England; they were its first series wins in those countries. Because Australia were scheduled for a tour to South Africa immediately after this series, they flew straight to South Africa for a four Test series without returning home."
